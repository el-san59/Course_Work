All cases presented with nasal obstruction and/or as a nasal mass. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging aided diagnosis determining the extent of intracranial involvement. Various surgical techniques were used ranging from simple excision to the lateral rhinotomy and Goodman's external rhinoplasty approach. Only five patients (10 per cent) suffered complications; two CSF leaks and three recurrences, all treated successfully.\r"

Four of eight patients with aneuploid acinic cell carcinomas have died because of their malignancies within a 10 year period after the first surgical removal of the carcinoma. Five of the eight patients exhibited metastases. Although the number of cases does not permit strong correlations between histopathological features, abnormalities in DNA content and outcome of patients, it was noted that carcinomas with prominent necrosis, tubuloductal differentiation and 'dedifferentiated' areas displayed more aggressive biological courses.\r"

  ".W": "Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multimodality evoked potentials (EPs) and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed in 42 patients with myelopathy of undetermined aetiology in order to detect abnormalities usually related to multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients were divided into three groups: insidious-onset myelopathy with only motor signs (group A; 11 patients), with both motor and sensory signs (group B; 18 patients) and acute-onset myelopathy (group C; 13 patients). Multiple brain MRI lesions were found in 18 patients (2 of group A, 13 of group B and 3 of group C). Another 7 patients had a single white-matter lesion. Visual EPs were abnormal in 21 and brain-stem auditory EPs in 12 patients. Paraclinical tests supported the diagnosis of MS in 25 patients (60%) by showing subclinical brain abnormalities. Oligoclonal bands were found in 16 of these 25 patients. The findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS in the patients of group B.\r"

  ".W": "The intra-individual variation in plasma concentration of phenytoin was studied in ten clinically well controlled children on monotherapy. The drug concentration was determined in routine pre-dose samples taken on three to five different mornings. On two of these occasions, plasma phenytoin was also determined at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 h after the dose. The difference between the highest and lowest morning concentrations in a patient varied between 7.5 and 40 mumol/l (mean 20.1 mumol/l). Half of all morning concentration values were lower than 40 mumol/l. This often-recommended lower limit for good seizure control should therefore be reconsidered. The two concentration versus time curves in each patient during 7 h after administration differed considerably in shape, and the first curve could not be used for prediction of the second curve. The ratio between unbound and total drug was very stable and amounted to 9.4, SD 0.94% (n = 168). It is concluded that the conventional single morning sample is satisfactory for routine monitoring in well-controlled children on monotherapy with phenytoin. In problem patients, and during combination therapy, however, more extensive investigation will be necessary, including repeated morning samples as well as determination of dose-interval curves and protein binding.\r"

Performance on a verbal and on a visuospatial memory task was compared with performance on largely identical memory tasks which were combined with concurrent non-motor tasks. As a further index of a possible weakness of the attentional control of cognitive function order memory was assessed and compared with item memory. Both parkinsonian patients and controls showed a decline of memory performance when the concurrent task was introduced, but the degree of decline did not differ between groups. Parkinsonian patients scored worse than controls on both conditions of the verbal memory task and had more intrusions from previous lists in the verbal single task. There was no significant difference between groups in either item or order memory, but in parkinsonians the scores on order memory decreased with advancing illness. It is concluded that patients with Parkinson's disease do not have a general inability to cope with concurrent task demands, but that the results can be interpreted as indicating a weakness of certain aspects of the attentional control of cognitive function.\r"

  ".W": "To calculate how often non-valvular atrial fibrillation should be considered as the cause of ischaemic stroke rather than an incidental finding as in primary cerebral haemorrhage, the frequency of non-valvular atrial fibrillation in 75 consecutive patients with primary intracerebral haemorrhage was compared with that in 63 patients with cortical infarcts and 44 patients with lacunar infarcts who were taken at random from 1487 consecutive patients with cerebral infarcts admitted during the same period. The frequency of non-valvular atrial fibrillation in lacunar infarcts did not differ from that in primary intracerebral haemorrhage (odds ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.32-5.1) (P = 1.0), whereas it was significantly higher in cortical infarcts (odds ratio: 5.57; 95% confidence interval 2.00-15.4) (P = 0.0001). Our findings suggest that non-valvular atrial fibrillation in lacunar infarcts, as in primary intracerebral haemorrhage, is unlikely to be the cause of this type of stroke, whereas perhaps 30% of all cortical infarcts are not caused by non-valvular atrial fibrillation when present. These data are important for the planning and explanatory evaluation of trials on the preventive effect of anticoagulants in stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.\r"

However within Scotland there are major geographical differences in the mortality rates, exemplified by the differences between the two largest Scottish cities. Glasgow on the west has a much higher mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases than Edinburgh in the east. During 1986 coronary risk factor population surveys were conducted simultaneously in Edinburgh and North Glasgow as part of the WHO MONICA study. These surveys employed standardized methods and the central quality control of the WHO project. Measures of coronary heart disease morbidity were higher in North Glasgow, except for electrocardiographic evidence of ischaemia, consistent with the mortality rates. The major coronary risk factors were uniformly higher in North Glasgow than in Edinburgh, except for serum lipids which were not significantly different. The risk factors, except the lipids, showed a gradient by socioeconomic status, so that when the risk factors levels were standardized for housing tenure the significant differences between the cities largely disappeared, and the serum cholesterol levels in women become significantly higher in Edinburgh because of their slight negative relationship with social status. This study shows that the socioeconomic differences between Edinburgh and North Glasgow largely explain the coronary risk factor differences between the cities. The socioeconomic differences in coronary disease and its major risk factors require further investigation and may be more fundamentally important than the geographical differences in the patterns of coronary heart disease.\r"

In the 1928 cohort, the prevalence of thyroid disorders was 11.5% overall (mean 2.4% , women 20.3%), and higher among immigrant women (20.7%) than among women of the native population, e.g. women born in and still living in Malmo (14.7%). In the 1941 cohort, the overall prevalence of thyroid disorders was 7.9% (men 1.5%, women 14.1%); and the prevalence of goiter was lower among immigrant women (9.5%) than among women of the native population (15.0%). Among the native population, the prevalence of goiter did not differ significantly between the two cohorts, whereas among immigrant women it was significantly greater in the 1928 cohort. The findings suggest that, although iodine deficiency is the most probable cause of goiter among immigrants of the 1928 cohort, where the native population is concerned (both men and women), some other goitrogenic factor(s) must be involved.\r"

Of these 164 persons, 26 were subsequently diagnosed as demented. The weighted data from this sample represent the estimated performance of these measures among elderly blacks and whites in a five county area. The 6 measures evaluated in this study (specificity figures for blacks precede those for whites) were (1) Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test (38%, 79%), (2) Mental Status Questionnaire (71%, 96%), (3) Mini-Mental State (58%, 94%), (4) Storandt et al. Battery (42%, 69%), (5) Iowa Battery (26%, 69%) and (6) Kendrick Cognitive Tests (92%, 97%). All but the Kendrick Cognitive Tests showed substantial sensitivity (90-100%) in detecting the presence of dementia. The specificity of the tests was particularly poor for blacks. The briefer, simpler measures tended to have greater accuracy than the longer and more complex measures. With rare exceptions, the scores obtained on these screens correlated with race and education.\r"

The main objective of the study reported here was to examine the relative importance of 28 items concerned with general health or with disease and treatment to a group of patients with metastatic breast cancer. All items concerned aspects of quality of life whose relevance and importance to patients with metastatic breast cancer had been shown in previous work. Patients rated items according to importance using two methods, a Q sort and a linear analogue rating. General health items, notably self-care, mobility, and physical activity, appetite, sleep, and family relationships were ranked in the upper quartile of the group of items rated. By contrast, items concerned directly with the common side-effects of chemotherapy were given lower rankings. The ratings were shown to be reproducible. These results emphasize the importance of including in clinical trials of therapy that are palliative in intent, endpoints that include those aspects of quality of life that are of greatest importance to patients.\r"

There were 85 COPD families with data on 270 individuals and 56 non-pulmonary families with data on 199 individuals. The analysis was done on residuals obtained from a regression of FEV1 on age, sex, race, height, and ascertainment group. Smoking status was incorporated directly as a covariate in the regressive models. Data on probands were excluded in this analysis as a partial correction for ascertainment bias. The best fitting model for the 85 COPD families included a major gene effect with sex specific variances, but no residual familial correlation. The best fitting model for the non-pulmonary families was one with no major gene effect and no residual familial correlation. Cigarette smoking was a significant covariate in both groups of families. Testing for heterogeneity showed a significant difference in the control of pulmonary function among these COPD and non-pulmonary families (X2 = 20.12 on 6 df; p = 0.0026). Major gene effects appear to be limited to these COPD families, while there was no evidence for major gene effects in the non-pulmonary families.\r"

Complete follow-up through 1986 revealed a total of 1472 deaths, which was somewhat lower than expected; the relative survival being 101.1% (95% CL, 100.8, 101.3) after 5 years and 102.4% (95% CL, 101.9, 102.8) after 10 years. The relative survival increased with increasing age at entry into the cohort, being 98.2% (95% CL, 96.6, 99.8) in the 40-44 and 105.2% (95% CL, 101.4, 109.1) in the 65-69 year age group after 10 years. Neither the type of compound (potent vs non-potent estrogens), nor the year of entry into the cohort seemed to affect survival, whereas survival advantage generally increased with years of follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that age at time of first prescription was the only determinant that significantly affected the death risk. This pattern could be explained by confounding due to selection of healthy subjects receiving hormone replacement therapy and/or by the specific choice of estrogen compounds (and progestogens), related to age. It is concluded that hormone replacement therapy is associated with a survival which is similar to or--notably at ages above 50-60 years--slightly higher than that in the general population.\r"

More than 36% of this population used a vitamin A supplement with 8% of these consuming an amount in excess of 2000 retinol equivalents (RE)/day. Serum retinol was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography and radial bone mass was measured using single photon absorptiometry.

  ".W": "The incidence of major handicaps was studied in a selected high-risk population of 1919 very low birth weight (less than or equal to 1500 gm) infants born between 1976 and 1985. Seventy-four percent of these infants were discharged alive. We have handicap information on 632 infants who have been followed for up to 7 years of age; 462 were evaluated at 18 months or later. Patients lost to follow-up represent 55% of the eligible population, but inpatient morbidity factors were available for the entire population and were used to calculate synthetic estimates of handicap rates. The overall incidence of severe major handicaps at 18 months was 18.0% (83/462). Cerebral palsy was found in 7.6%, and 6.5% were mentally retarded (IQ less than or equal to 70). Severe retinopathy of prematurity was present in 5.5%, and 5.4% of the infants had neurosensory hearing loss. Thirty-one infants (6.7%) had more than one handicap, the most common combination being cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Outcome of infants grouped by 250 gm birth weight intervals was compared for two periods (1976 to 1980, and 1981 to 1985); the numbers of survivors in each birth weight group increased during the second period, especially in the 500 to 750 gm and the 751 to 1000 gm groups. The observed incidence of major handicaps decreased from the first 5-year period to the second 5-year period (p less than 0.001). The largest decreases in the observed proportion handicapped occurred in the two lowest birth weight groups. The incidence of multiple handicaps also dropped; again, the two lowest birth weight groups showed the largest decrease. We conclude that an increased survival rate of very low birth weight infants need not be associated with an increased incidence of major handicaps.\r"

The fibroblasts of two patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type I synthesized a reduced quantity of qualitatively normal type I procollagen. Another patient with osteogenesis imperfecta type I had two populations of type I collagen molecules, one apparently normal and the other with a substitution of cysteine for glycine in the triple helical domain. Three sporadic cases with osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV were studied; in each proband a normal and an abnormal overmodified population of type I collagen molecules were demonstrated, and parental collagens were normal in the two available patients. These results indicated that the probands were heterozygous for new dominant mutations and assisted our genetic counseling, especially in osteogenesis imperfecta types II and III, which were formerly believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The results could not exclude parental germ line mosaicism for a new dominant mutation, which has resulted in recurrence in siblings of some patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, so prenatal diagnosis was therefore offered for future pregnancies. Analysis of chorionic villus cell collagen may facilitate antenatal diagnosis in selected cases, and the study of a larger number of patients may allow correlation of the biochemical defects with the natural history and prognosis.\r"

All patients underwent resection of the tumor. Group 1 (N = 38) had complete resection of tumors, with low or intermediate grade histology and without lymph node spread. Group 2 consisted of the remaining 40 patients who had high-risk features (HR) (high grade histology, lymph node metastases, and close or positive margins of resection). Half of the Group 2 patients received radiation therapy. Overall survival was 63% at 5 years, and 35% at 15 years. Survival of Group 1 was 83% at 5 years and 58% at 15 years. Local control for Group 1 was 69% at 5 years, 54% at 15 years, and was size-dependent. Group 2 survival was 40% at 5 years and 29% at 10 years. Local control at 5 and 10 years was 49% and 35%. Our data indicate that surgery alone yielded good local control in patients with small tumors (less than or equal to 3 cm) and no HR features, suggesting that postoperative RT may be unnecessary for these patients. Other patients have suboptimal local control, and although there is a rationale for the use of postoperative radiotherapy, we cannot assess its impact in this retrospective study.\r"

  ".U": "90318114\r", 
  ".W": "Ninety five patients who developed in transit melanoma either as their initial site of recurrent melanoma or following regional node metastases were retrospectively reviewed. In transit melanoma occurred most frequently on the lower extremity and appeared to be associated with deeply invasive primary tumors. The median time to development of in transit melanoma was 16 months. Eighty-two (86%) of these patients have progressed to systemic disease from 2 to 244 months (median 16 months) following the development of in transit melanoma, and 72 (79%) died (median survival 19 months). Survival appears to correlate with the extent of in transit melanoma and with the disease-free interval. These findings suggest that in transit melanoma represents an early manifestation of systemic disease, warranting careful clinical follow-up and perhaps systemic treatment, when effective therapy becomes available. However, some patients will respond to local immunotherapy, surgical excision, and isolated limb perfusion and will enjoy significant length and quality of life. This sequential approach remains the treatment of choice for this manifestation of metastatic melanoma.\r"

Our data indicate that all fibroadenomas were diploid, cystosarcoma phyllodes displayed diploid and aneuploid DNA content irrespective of their histological categorization, and that stromal sarcomas were all aneuploid and clinically aggressive. Diploid cystosarcoma phyllodes were biologically indolent, whereas most of the aneuploid neoplasms killed their hosts (P = 0.03). The present study indicates that a DNA content abnormality it is a reliable marker of malignancy in these neoplasms, and it may identify subsets of patients with variable biologic courses within the histopathologic spectrum of cystosarcoma phyllodes.\r"

In a combined study of three Dutch hospitals, a total of 166 patients with cecal carcinoma were evaluated after right hemicolectomy. Special emphasis was placed on clinical symptoms related to advanced tumor growth, e.g., pain, anemia, and palpable mass. These factors and clinicopathological staging were evaluated with aid of the Cox regression model. Ninety percent of the resected specimens contained a Dukes' B or C carcinoma. Only 5% were found to have widespread metastatic disease. Overall 5 year survival rate was found to be 0.57. No statistically significant relation to pain or palpable mass was found. Anemia, however, was related to a better survival, especially in patients with a Dukes' B carcinoma. Clinicopathological staging according to Dukes' is closely related to survival. It is concluded that carcinoma of the cecum behaves similarly to other colon malignancies.\r"

Similarities exist between the two groups and, although stomal recurrence has a greater association with subglottic tumour, this difference is not statistically significant. The possible mechanisms of recurrence are discussed, particularly in relation to aggressiveness, and it is concluded that factors involved in aggressive recurrences are similar. Stomal recurrence can be considered part of a group of aggressive neck recurrences associated with more advanced disease prior to laryngectomy.\r"

We evaluated 11 cases of male breast cancer with respect to tumor growth, extent of disease, hormone receptor status, and histological grade of the malignancy, in comparison with 241 cases of female breast cancer. The duration of symptoms was 8.6 +/- 9.1 months in males and 8.5 +/- 18.6 months in females. The incidences of stages I, II, and III were 46%, 27%, and 27%, respectively, in male breast cancer, and 38%, 49%, and 13% in female breast cancer. Metastasis to the lymph node was negative in 60% of the male patients and 54% of the female patients. All cases of male breast cancer were histologically grade I according to Bloom's classification; the histological grades were as follows for the female breast cancer cases: grade I in 99 patients, grade II in 87, and grade III in 55. The rates of hormone receptor positively were 89% for ER and 86% for PgR in male breast cancer, and 64% for ER and 44% for PgR in female breast cancer. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the growth of male breast cancer and female breast cancer, but in male breast cancer the rate of hormone receptor positivity was high, endocrine therapy was effective, and the histological grade was low. Accordingly, the result following appropriate treatment of male breast cancer should be at least comparable to the results with female breast cancer.\r"

In both systems, several region-specific glucagon antisera gave a positive immunoreaction with tumour cells indicating synthesis of multiple molecular species. Intraocular tumour transplants released glucagon into the chamber fluid. In animals with unilateral transplants, glucagon was also detected in the contralateral eye chamber, indicating passage from the transplants via unknown mechanisms. Treatment of tumour cells during culture with SMS 201-995 inhibited rapidly the spontaneous release of glucagon without evident cytotoxic effects. The inhibitory effect decreased with time.\r"

This investigation documented incubation periods of longer than 12 years in a mother and her daughter; although neither has symptoms, both are definitely infected and have very low CD4(+)-lymphocyte counts. The study confirmed the predictions of incubation periods longer than 10 years in a small proportion of infected individuals. It provides evidence that vertically HIV-1-infected teenagers can be expected to appear in the population.\r"

GNB were cultured from all samples of unfermented dough (51) and from 16 of 51 samples of fermented dough. The extent of contamination was significantly higher in the unfermented dough than in fermented dough (5.9 [SEM 0.1] vs 4.0 [0.4] log10 colony forming units/g). After 6 h and 12 h storage, a higher proportion of samples of porridge made from unfermented dough contained GNB than did those made with fermented dough (45/51 vs 22/55; 49/51 vs 20/51, respectively) and levels of GNB were significantly higher in the porridge made from unfermented dough after 6 h (4.2 [0.2] vs 3.8 [0.2]). Fermentation of maize dough is an effective method to reduce contamination of maize dough weaning foods with GNB.\r"

A product of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde, was measured in 10 subjects with stable angina who underwent angioplasty of a proximal high-grade stenosis (over 90%) of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In all subjects the duration of balloon occlusion was 60 s. Blood was withdrawn from the great cardiac vein immediately before balloon inflation (T0), immediately after balloon deflation (T60), 15 s after balloon deflation (T75), and 1 min after balloon deflation (T120). There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde at T60 compared with T0 for the first balloon inflation (mean increase 0.3 mumol/l [95% confidence limits 0.1, 0.5]), and at both T60 (0.31 mumol/l [0.15, 0.47]) and T75 (0.22 mumol/l [0.04, 0.40]) for the second balloon inflation.

There was some heterogeneity between trials in the effect of beta blockade on secondary prevention. When only fully reported, randomised, placebo-controlled studies were included the heterogeneity disappeared, and the reductions in bleeding episodes and mortality became more striking. Separate analyses of primary and secondary prevention studies also showed clear reductions in occurrence of variceal bleeding and deaths. These results seem to indicate the value of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs for the primary prevention of haemorrhage from large oesophageal varices. However, there is still a need for large multicentre trials of beta-blockade for primary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients without large varices and of comparisons between beta-blocker therapy with other treatments in secondary prevention.\r"

Described here is an attempt to devise criteria that would produce a well-founded early signal of an adverse reaction on the basis of reports sent in by national collaborating centres and combined in the WHO database. To reduce the frequency of spurious associations (false-positive signals) it is suggested that publication be delayed until a few case-histories meeting the suggested criteria have been sent in. The criteria were tested retrospectively against early published case-reports on drug-associated agranulocytosis. 19 suspected associations were examined and a signal in the database was defined by there being three or more cases containing stipulated information about the patient and the treatment. The WHO database had reports on all the associations, suggested criteria for a signal being met in 15 instances. This signal was present when the first case was published in 7 instances and within three months of first publication in 1. Moreover, in 3 instances where publication came first the cases presented had been collected by a national drug monitoring centre. The WHO databank has the potential to provide doctors and scientists with signals which then should be evaluated in detail.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a newly recognized illness that has been associated with the consumption of tryptophan products. It is not known whether the cause is related to the tryptophan itself or to chemical constituents introduced by the manufacturing process. METHODS. To describe the epidemiology of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome further and elucidate a possible association with the manufacturing process, we conducted surveillance for the syndrome in Minnesota, a community survey of tryptophan use in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and a case-control study to assess potential risk factors, including the use of tryptophan from different manufacturers. We performed high-performance liquid chromatography on tryptophan samples to identify other chemical constituents. RESULTS. The prevalence of tryptophan use increased from 1980 to 1989 and was highest among women. Among the subjects for whom the source of the tryptophan was known, 29 of 30 case patients (97 percent) and 21 of 35 controls (60 percent) had consumed tryptophan manufactured by a single company (odds ratio, 19.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 844.9; P less than 0.001). This company used a fermentation process involving Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to manufacture tryptophan. Analysis of the manufacturing conditions according to the retail lot demonstrated an association between lots used by case patients and the use of reduced quantities of powdered carbon in a purification step (odds ratio, 9.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 84.6; P = 0.014), as well as the use of a new strain of B. amyloliquefaciens (Strain V) (odds ratio, 6.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 51.8; P = 0.04). There was a significant correlation (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001) between the reduced amount of powdered carbon used during manufacturing and the use of the new bacterial strain. High-performance liquid chromatography of this company's tryptophan demonstrated one absorbance peak (peak E) that was present in 9 of the 12 retail lots (75 percent) used by patients and 3 of 11 lots (27 percent) used by controls (odds ratio, 8.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 76.6; P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS. The outbreak of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in 1989 resulted from the ingestion of a chemical constituent that was associated with specific tryptophan-manufacturing conditions at one company. The chemical constituent represented by peak E may contribute to the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or it may be a surrogate for another chemical that induces the syndrome.\r"

There is preliminary evidence that recombinant human erythropoietin may also increase hemoglobin F production. METHODS and RESULTS. We treated five patients with sickle cell disease with escalating doses of intravenous erythropoietin for eight weeks. Three of these patients were subsequently treated with daily doses of oral hydroxyurea. After the optimal dose was determined, erythropoietin was then given along with hydroxyurea for four weeks. Treatment with erythropoietin, either alone or in combination with hydroxyurea, had no significant effect on the percentage of hemoglobin F-containing reticulocytes (F reticulocytes) or red cells (F cells). In contrast, hydroxyurea treatment was associated with a 3-to-25-fold increase in F reticulocytes, a 1.6-to-7-fold increase in F cells, and a 2.3-to-16-fold increase in the percentage of hemoglobin F. In all three patients given hydroxyurea, treatment with this drug was associated with reduced hemolysis, shown by decreases in serum bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase and prolongation of red-cell survival. Hydroxyurea treatment also resulted in a decrease in the percentage of irreversibly sickled cells and sickling at partial oxygen saturation, an increase in oxygen affinity and total red-cell cation content, and a reduction in potassium-chloride cotransport. All three patients had a decrease in the number of pain crises. CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms that hydroxyurea therapy increases hemoglobin F production and provides objective evidence that hydroxyurea reduces the rate of hemolysis and intracellular polymerization of hemoglobin S. In contrast, recombinant human erythropoietin, whether alone or in combination with hydroxyurea, offers no measurable benefit.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND and METHODS. Inositol is a major component of the intracellular mediators of insulin action. To investigate the possible role of altered inositol metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to measure the myo-inositol and chiro-inositol content of urine specimens from normal subjects and patients with NIDDM. The study subjects were whites, blacks, and Pima Indians. The type of inositol and its concentration in insulin-mediator preparations from muscle-biopsy specimens from normal subjects and diabetic patients were also determined. RESULTS. The urinary excretion of chiro-inositol was much lower in the patients with NIDDM (mean [+/- SE], 1.8 +/- 0.8 mumol per day) than in the normal subjects (mean, 84.9 +/- 26.9 mumol per day; P less than 0.01). In contrast, the mean urinary myo-inositol excretion was higher in the diabetic patients than in the normal subjects (444 +/- 135 vs. 176 +/- 46 mumol per day; P less than 0.05). There was no correlation between chiro-inositol excretion and the age, sex, or weight of the diabetic patients, nor was there any correlation between urinary chiro-inositol and myo-inositol excretion in either group. The results were similar in a primate model of NIDDM, and chiro-inositol excretion was decreased to a lesser extent in animals with prediabetic insulin resistance. chiro-Inositol was undetectable in insulin-mediator preparations from muscle-biopsy samples obtained from patients with NIDDM. Similar preparations from normal subjects contained substantial amounts of chiro-inositol. Furthermore, the chiro-inositol content of such preparations increased after the administration of insulin during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic-clamp studies in normal subjects but not in patients with NIDDM. CONCLUSIONS. NIDDM is associated with decreased chiro-inositol excretion and decreased chiro-inositol content in muscle. These abnormalities seem to reflect the presence of insulin resistance in NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Carmustine (BCNU) is an anticancer drug known to produce pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect within three years of treatment. It is not known whether pulmonary fibrosis can appear later. METHODS. To investigate the clinical range of this side effect, we studied the survivors among 31 children treated with carmustine for brain tumors between 1972 and 1976. Fourteen had died of their tumor; of the remaining 17, 6 had died of lung fibrosis--2 within 3 years of treatment and 4 from 8 to 13 years after treatment. This report focuses primarily on the 11 survivors, 8 of whom were available for detailed study 13 to 17 years (mean, 14) after treatment. RESULTS. Of the eight survivors studied, six had abnormal chest radiographs showing predominantly upper-zone fibrotic changes. These patients also had abnormal CT scans, showing a previously undescribed pattern of upper-zone fibrosis. All the survivors studied had restrictive spirometric defects (mean [+/- SD] vital capacity, 54 +/- 19 percent of the predicted value). Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid contained abnormal proportions of specific macrophage subgroups. Light and electron microscopy in six patients revealed interstitial fibrosis and elastosis with damage to epithelial and endothelial cells. Four patients had symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, or both). CONCLUSIONS. Carmustine chemotherapy in childhood causes lung fibrosis that may remain asymptomatic for many years or become symptomatic at any time.\r"

The study was confined to the first 1000 nulliparas delivered in 1988 who went into labor after 37 weeks' gestation with a single live fetus and cephalic presentation. The management of labor was standardized. As birth weight increased, there was an increase in the mean duration of labor and of the second stage of labor, in the incidence of oxytocin augmentation, and in the incidence of both cesarean and forceps delivery for dystocia. The direct relationship between birth weight and the mean duration of labor was independent of gestation and oxytocin augmentation. These findings suggest that birth weight is an important factor in the development of dystocia in nulliparas.\r"

The excitatory effect of oxytocin was enhanced by external magnesium, and the dose-response curve between oxytocin and relative tension in the presence of 118 mM potassium in tiny muscle strips shifted to the left with increases in magnesium from 0 to 2.4 mM. Oxytocin potentiates spontaneous contractions by enhancing the plateau part of action potentials, and the plateau potential induced in 2.4-mM magnesium was larger than that in magnesium-free solution. In potassium contracture experiments, the muscle contraction was potentiated in accordance with the concentration of preloaded magnesium when 10(-3) U/mL oxytocin was added at the tonic phase. These results suggest that magnesium might primarily potentiate the excitatory effect of oxytocin in electrical and mechanical activities of pregnant human myometrium at superficial sites of the plasma membrane, allowing the possibility of its intracellular action.\r"

  ".U": "90318673\r", 
  ".W": "The route of delivery for the fetus with an abdominal wall defect is controversial. This investigation proposed two null hypotheses: 1) The prognosis for the fetus with an abdominal wall defect is not affected by the timing of the diagnosis (antenatal or postnatal); and 2) the route of delivery does not affect fetal outcome. Sixty-one pregnancies complicated by either fetal gastroschisis (33) or omphalocele (28) delivered between December 1979 and January 1989 were reviewed. Seventy-one percent of the fetuses with gastroschisis and 59% with omphalocele were born vaginally. Gestational age at delivery, incidence of meconium staining, days to first neonatal oral feeding, percentage of neonates with one-stage closure of their defect, and percent of neonates with a birth weight less than the tenth percentile for gestational age were similar in fetuses with gastroschisis and with omphalocele, whether diagnosed antenatally or at birth. Significantly lower birth weights and longer neonatal hospitalizations were noted in the infants with omphalocele diagnosed antenatally compared with those diagnosed at birth (P less than .03), but no such differences were seen with gastroschisis. The route of delivery did not affect outcome for either defect. All fetuses born with gastroschisis and 87% with omphalocele free of associated lethal abnormalities were discharged alive. We conclude that the antenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is not associated with either worse disease or a poorer outcome, though this may not be true for omphalocele. The good outcome with a high vaginal delivery rate suggests the need for a randomized trial of vaginal and cesarean delivery for fetal gastroschisis and omphalocele.\r"

In five pregnancies from four patients treated with T4, serum free T4, which was measured by a newly developed radioimmunoassay, decreased during pregnancy but increased above the normal range after delivery. Consistent with these changes in free T4, serum TSH (measured by a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay) increased during pregnancy but returned to an undetectable level after delivery, with one exception. The serum triiodothyronine (T3)-to-T4 ratio, which is related to peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, was lower in patients treated with T4 than in normal controls, regardless of pregnancy. The ratio decreased further during pregnancy, and so relative deficiency of T3 during pregnancy was suspected, especially in T4-treated patients. On the other hand, in two pregnancies from two other patients treated with desiccated thyroid at a dose most equivalent to that of T4, serum free T4 decreased to a low-normal value during gestation but returned to the normal range after delivery, whereas serum TSH scarcely changed during pregnancy. These findings indicate that replacement therapy for pregnant patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy should include an increased dose of T4; in contrast, the dose of desiccated thyroid need not be changed.\r"

The platelet count in cord blood from infants of hypertensive mothers was compared with that of a control normotensive population, and other comparisons were made among various maternal hypertensive groups. The rate of neonatal thrombocytopenia was 9.2% in hypertensive patients, compared with 2.2% in infants of normotensive mothers (P less than .00001). In the hypertensive group, preterm birth was the major risk factor for neonatal thrombocytopenia. Term infants of hypertensive mothers were no more likely to be thrombocytopenic than were control infants. Only two infants, both preterm, had cord platelet counts below 50 x 10(9)/L. Although obstetric interventions are not indicated, the rate of thrombocytopenia in preterm infants born to hypertensive women justifies neonatal scrutiny.\r"

We hypothesized that the prevalence of asymptomatic hepatitis B virus infection in Mexican-American women was much lower and that most belonged to established risk groups. Three thousand seven hundred eight-nine pregnant women, 77% of whom had Hispanic surnames, were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen upon admission in labor to Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio. Twelve women, six of whom had Hispanic surnames, were found to have asymptomatic hepatitis B infections. The prevalence of asymptomatic infections was 3.2 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 1.6-5.5) in the total population, 2.0 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 0.7-4.5) in those with Hispanic surnames, and 7.0 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 2.5-15.0) in those with non-Hispanic surnames. Risk factors, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, were found in five (42%) of the positive patients overall and in only one (17%) of the positive patients with an Hispanic surname. We conclude that, although asymptomatic hepatitis B infection is uncommon in these pregnant Mexican-American women, the absence of identifiable risk factors in the majority of those infected suggests that routine screening in this population is justified.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens in 121 pregnant patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. We obtained urine for culture by catheterization and defined a positive culture as greater than 100 colony-forming units per milliliter of urine. We determined bacterial sensitivities with either the Bauer-Kirby disc diffusion test or the Vitek Auto Microbic System. During the 4 years of the study, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant organisms was 26% (95% confidence interval 18-34%). However, only 4% (95% confidence interval 0-8%) of the uropathogens were resistant to limited-spectrum, first-generation cephalosporins. This observed difference in antibiotic sensitivity was highly significant (P less than .005). Therefore, we conclude that a limited-spectrum cephalosporin is more appropriate than ampicillin for empirical therapy of pyelonephritis in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied all physicians who purchased obstetric malpractice insurance from the Washington State Physicians Insurance Exchange and Association between January 1, 1982 and July 1, 1988. Of the 690 physicians studied, 171 (32% of the family physicians and 10% of the obstetricians) discontinued obstetrics but remained in practice. Physicians who discontinued obstetric practice were older, more likely to practice in an urban area, and more likely to be in solo practice than those who did not. Obstetricians who discontinued obstetric practice had a higher rate of new obstetric malpractice claims than did those who did not quit practicing obstetrics--14.5 versus 6.2 claims per 100 physician-years of coverage. By contrast, those family physicians leaving obstetrics had a lower rate of new claims than their peers who did not quit. We conclude that older physicians--particularly those in urban and solo practice--are most likely to stop practicing obstetrics, regardless of specialty. In addition, being named as the target of an obstetric malpractice claim plays a significant role in the decision of some obstetricians to discontinue obstetric practice.\r"

Aneuploidy was not detected in low-grade carcinomas. A DNA index greater than 1.5 strongly predicted death from disease. For endometrial adenocarcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma, this finding appeared independent of stage or tumor grade. The percentage of cells in S phase or G2 + M of the cell cycle did not predict clinical outcome in diploid tumors. Application of DNA analysis to low-stage endometrial cancers of high grade or of papillary serous type may be useful for selecting a subgroup of patients for adjuvant therapy.\r"

The primary treatment was combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, actinomycin D, and chlorambucil (MAC). Patients who failed to respond to this regimen were treated secondarily with other combinations. Adjuvant surgery and radiotherapy were used in selected cases. The overall remission rate was 89% (25 of 28): 71% for first-line treatment with MAC (20 of 28) and 62% for second-line treatment (five of eight). The response rate to MAC correlated well with the patient's score (modified World Health Organization [WHO] scoring system--1983). Seventeen patients treated with MAC had scores less than 12, and all of them achieved remission. Of 11 patients having scores of 12 or more, only three achieved remission with MAC (27%). Of the eight who did not, five achieved remission with other combinations (62%) and three died. No patient died because of chemotherapy toxicity. The WHO scoring system is a good index to select high-risk patients who need primary chemotherapy more aggressive than MAC.\r"

Although more patients with micropapillomatosis labialis than controls had HPV DNA detected, this was not statistically significant (eight of 34 versus three of 34, respectively; and two of 23 versus one of 34, respectively, when only biopsies were analyzed). In a second part of the study, 22 patients with micropapillomatosis labialis were followed without treatment; the lesion regressed in 45% and persisted in 55% of the patients. Among 11 patients treated with CO2 laser, 5-fluorouracil, or trichloroacetic acid, the lesion persisted in three cases. These results suggest that these introital changes are unrelated to HPV and that a high percentage will regress without treatment.\r"

Older patients presented with more advanced-stage cancers and, as a group, had significantly poorer presurgical performance status and more intercurrent medical problems. Nevertheless, the planned radical surgical procedure could be carried out in 90% of elderly patients, with a postoperative mortality of 1.5%. Minor postoperative complication rates were similar for the two groups and, except for vulvectomy patients, the mean inpatient stay was the same for both groups. Chronological age alone is a poor determinant of surgical risk, and elderly patients withstand radical surgery almost as well as their younger counterparts.\r"

Bone mass was measured in the lumbar vertebrae and hip using dual photon absorptiometry. Both estrogen-treated women and the control group received calcium supplements to bring total intake to approximately 1500 mg/day. For those women with an intact uterus in the estrogen wing of the study, a progestin was added to the therapy for 12-14 days each calendar month. The number of years from menopause was 14.6 +/- 0.9 in the estrogen-treated group and 13.7 +/- 1.1 in the calcium-treated group. Estrogen treatment was associated with increased vertebral bone mass by dual photon absorptiometry during the 2 years of the study (+10.6%; P less than .01). There was also an increase in bone density at the femoral neck (+5.5%; P less than .1), but the difference from the initial value was not statistically significant. The group given calcium alone lost bone at both sites, although the loss was not statistically significant at either site. The response to estrogen was greatest in those who were furthest from menopause (r = 0.38, P less than .05) and consequently among those who had the lowest bone mass (r = -0.34, P less than .05). Estrogen therapy appears to be an effective therapy for patients with established osteoporosis. Intervention is associated with a significant increase in bone mass compatible with reduced skeletal turnover and activation frequency.\r"

Behavior was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and its Addendum, and intakes of calories and nutrients were measured by allowing subjects unlimited access to isocaloric meal and snack foods rich in carbohydrates or protein. Pre-treatment follicular scores using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and its Addendum were 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 0.5 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM), respectively; corresponding luteal scores were 21.2 +/- 0.8 and 10.2 +/- 0.6 (P less than .0001).

The validity and reliability of this instrument were assessed by administering it throughout two consecutive ovulatory cycles to 36 rigidly screened women with PMS and to 18 controls. To establish concurrent validity, scores on behavioral items were correlated with simultaneously obtained scores on lengthier, well-validated psychiatric inventories designed to measure depression rather than PMS, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Profile of Mood States. The results showed that the calendar of premenstrual experiences luteal phase score distinguished PMS women from controls correctly in 104 of 108 cycles, with a 2.8% false-negative rate and no false positives when used for two consecutive cycles. An upper limit follicular phase score was observed beneath which all PMS and normal control subjects fell, suggesting that a higher score is not consistent with PMS. Correlation coefficients of calendar item scores with Profile of Mood States scale scores were 0.58 for tension, 0.51 for depression, 0.46 for anger, 0.61 for fatigue, and 0.57 for confusion (P less than .0001 for all correlations). The correlation of the calendar depression item with the Beck Depression Inventory score was 0.56 (P less than .0001). The test-retest reliability of the calendar given in the same phase of two consecutive menstrual cycles was high (r = 0.78, P less than .0001). We conclude that this instrument is a valid, reliable, and practical PMS inventory, applicable to clinical and some research settings.\r"

In the past, various configurations of intraosseous wiring were used both at the lower and upper borders of the mandible. This study investigated which of four configurations offers the greatest mechanical resistance to a typical displacing force. Twelve baboon mandibles were cleared of all soft tissues and sectioned in the midline, and the most distal erupted molar tooth was extracted. Jigs were constructed to ensure that each mandible was sectioned in a standard fashion and that holes for wiring were drilled at a standard distance from the cut line. Mandibular halves, wired under standard conditions, were placed in an Instron tensile testing machine and subjected to a constant force that simulated the action of the major elevator muscles. Graphic recordings of force versus displacement were made. The results were subjected to an analysis of covariance, and to Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons. Results indicate that under experimental conditions, without jagged fracture surfaces, upper border mandibular wiring is less efficient than lower border wiring. At the lower border, a figure-of-eight wire is more effective than a combination figure-of-eight and straight wire, and at the upper border, the figure-of-eight wire is more effective than the straight wire.\r"

The cell-mediated immunity assessed by enumerating the total and high-affinity rosette-forming cells of the patient did not show any significant variation from that of the normal control subjects. The humoral immune response was assessed by estimating serum immunoglobulins G, A, M, D, and E by single radial immunodiffusion. Except IgD, all other immunoglobulins were found to be elevated significantly in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. The alteration in humoral immune response may be the cause or the effect of periodontitis. The defective host response reported in diabetic patients may be responsible for the increased incidence of periodontitis in diabetic patients as compared to nondiabetic patients.\r"

In group 1 the lesions were restricted to the contact area opposing the dental restoration, whereas the extent of the lesions in group 2 exceeded that of the contact area. Epicutaneous test for mercury allergy showed that a significantly greater proportion of the patients in group 1 had positive reactions to mercury than in group 2 (p = 0.019). The amalgam restorations were replaced by composite resin or porcelain fused to gold crowns, or contact between amalgam fillings and oral mucosa was prevented by an acrylic splint. After this treatment regression of lesions was far more pronounced in group 1 than in group 2 (p less than 0.001). On the basis of these findings, contact allergy to mercury is suggested as a possible etiologic factor of the mucosal changes in group 1, and the designation contact lesion is proposed for such lesions. The lesions of patients in group 2 seem unrelated to a contact allergy to mercury, and other causes such as lichen planus should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the most suitable vaccination schedule in developing countries, a study was conducted to reevaluate the immunogenicity of monovalent measles vaccine and trivalent measles-mumps-rubella vaccine at different ages. The success rate of measles vaccination was 84% at 9 months, 88% at 12 months and 100% at 15 months of age. Vaccination with measles vaccines at 9 and 15 months of age was also 96% immunogenic. Most vaccinees (16 of 17) not responding to the first measles vaccine before 1 year of age developed measles antibody with another shot of vaccine after 15 months of age. Trivalent measles-mumps-rubella vaccine worked well in children ages 14 to 18 months. Administering trivalent vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine concurrently at 1 year of age, rubella and mumps antibodies developed in more than 95% of vaccinees, while measles antibody was detected in 88%. Responses to hepatitis B vaccine in this situation were good; 89% of vaccinees developed antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml) and the geometric mean titer was 362.49 mIU/ml. In summary vaccination twice at 9 and 15 months is effective and is a useful regimen in developing countries where measles is still endemic. Trivalent vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine will not interfere with each other when given together at 1 year of age.\r"

Preschool children often shed cytomegalovirus and commonly transmit virus to peers and parents. Workers from 32 day care centers were enrolled and tested for serum antibody to cytomegalovirus; 318 (62.5%) were seropositive. By logistic regression analysis the only variables significantly (P less than 0.05) associated with seropositivity at enrollment were older age and nonwhite race, though contact with younger children (less than 2 years of age) attained a P value of 0.06. Follow-up sera were obtained at 6-month intervals from 82 initially seronegative workers; 19 seroconverted in a median interval of 14 months, a rate of 20%/year, approximately 10-fold higher than the expected rate. The only demographic or employment variable associated with seroconversion was contact with children younger than 3 years of age for at least 20 hours per week (P = 0.03). Day care center workers have a markedly increased risk for acquisition of cytomegalovirus; those who could become pregnant should be appropriately counseled regarding prevention and consequences of cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy.\r"

There was no difference in age, sex, race, duration of wound or symptoms before admission or in admission physical findings including temperature, lymphadenopathy, puncture site appearance or admission laboratory data including white blood cell count or erythrocyte sedimentation rate between the two groups. All children but two in the long term therapy group had surgical as well as parenteral anti-Pseudomonas therapy. Fifteen patients returned for follow-up radiographs 1 to 8 1/2 years after hospitalization, 10 of 20 who had received therapy for greater than 21 days and 5 of 7 who had received therapy for less than or equal to 21 days. Poor radiologic outcome, ranging from bony deformity to joint space abnormality, was noted in 4 patients, of whom 3 had had joint involvement. Clinical abnormality was noted in only one adolescent male, and he had the most severe radiologic sequelae. The longer term functional significance of these radiologic anomalies awaits further delineation.\r"

  ".W": "Although few episodes of diarrhea last longer than 14 days these episodes are particularly associated with growth faltering and malnutrition. We have examined the role of the duodenal microflora in prolonging diarrhea in Peruvian children ages 3 to 36 months by comparing the microflora in 89 children with persistent diarrhea, 38 children with acute diarrhea and 34 diarrhea-free controls from the same environment. Bacteria were retrieved from 93% of all aspirates, including 94% of those from controls. There were no significant differences among the 3 groups with respect to total bacterial count, to the proportion of children with duodenal Enterobacteriaceae and to the proportion with anaerobes, lending no support to the hypothesis that proliferation of bacteria in the small intestine during the acute illness prolongs diarrhea. When only children older than 18 months were compared, anaerobes were cultured more frequently from those with persistent diarrhea than from controls, but the presence of anaerobes was not associated with adverse clinical outcome. Although malabsorption, especially steatorrhea, was common, there was no association between elevated bacterial counts and fecal loss of nutrients in 69 children who received the same diet. In this population steatorrhea could not be attributed to bacterial overgrowth.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical discharge and laboratory records were reviewed in the seven government hospitals that provide care for 93% of the pediatric population of Santiago, Chile, to detect cases of meningitis and other invasive (bacteremia-associated) infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. infections that occurred in children less than five years of age from January, 1985, through December, 1987, were recorded and matched with census data to calculate incidence rates. The incidence of meningitis and non-meningitis syndromes peaked in the 6- to 11-month age group and tapered sharply after 12 months of age. The city-wide incidence (ca. 21.6 cases/10(5) children less than 5 years of age) is one-third to one-half that reported for the general pediatric population in the United States. However, there is much evidence for under-reporting in Santiago. In Area Norte, served by Roberto del Rio Children's Hospital where H. influenzae has been a subject of research by pediatricians for years, the incidence of invasive H. influenzae infections (42.5/105) is approximately two-fold higher than the rest of Santiago. The cumulative proportions of episodes of H. influenzae disease occurring in successively older age groups closely parallel the pattern seen in the general United States pediatric population. Although only ca. 20% of all episodes occur during the first 6 months of life, nearly 80% of episodes are seen by 18 months of age. Based on the observed incidence rates, the apparent underreporting and the high city-wide case fatality of Hib meningitis (16%), invasive H. influenzae infections represent an important public health problem in Santiago, Chile.\r"

Blood samples obtained at about 17 and 32 weeks of gestation and at the time of delivery were assessed for antibody to HSV-2 glycoprotein G in order to evaluate the prevalence of past infections with HSV-2 and the rate of acquisition of HSV-2 infection during pregnancy. Three hundred eleven pregnant women (16.5%) were found to have had past infections with HSV-2. Four of the 1580 women who were initially seronegative developed antibodies to HSV-2 during pregnancy. The annualized rate of acquisition of HSV-2 infection in pregnant women was 0.58%. Three of four women had asymptomatic primary infections; all of the women had preexisting HSV-1 immunity. None of the women or their infants experienced any adverse consequences of gestational herpes. Based upon our very limited number of observations to date, asymptomatic primary episodes occurring in women with previous HSV-1 immunity may be of less consequence to the fetus and neonate than symptomatic true primary HSV-2 infections.\r"

  ".W": "In the ideal situation, the evaluation for sepsis in the young infant should include collection of multiple blood cultures before the institution of antibiotics. Unfortunately, in some infants, it may not be possible to obtain more than a single blood culture at the time of initial evaluation. If this single culture ultimately grows coagulase-negative staphylococci and the infant has been treated with antimicrobial therapy in the interim, it is often difficult to determine whether the positive culture represents true infection or contamination. Our data suggest that peripheral blood cultures yielding high colony counts most likely represent infection. Furthermore, in this high-risk patient population, low colony-count growth should not be ignored as contamination, particularly if there are significant clinical findings or if the infant has a central catheter or hematologic abnormality. Future studies should examine these important issues.\r"

Effusion developed in 44 (39%) of the patients during the course of treatment. Young age, rapid onset of illness, low peripheral white blood cell count, and high cerebrospinal fluid levels of protein and bacterial antigen were associated with a higher likelihood of developing effusion. Although patients with effusion were more likely to have neurologic abnormalities both at the time of admission and at completion of therapy, and were more likely to have seizures during the course of treatment, there was no greater incidence of seizures, hearing loss, neurologic deficits, or developmental delay on longterm follow-up (median follow-up interval 5.5 years) in patients with effusion. Specific invasive therapy is not indicated in infants with meningitis and subdural effusion who are otherwise improving.\r"

Factors affecting the frequency of breast-feeding were also evaluated. Mothers nursed their neonates, on average, 4.3 +/- 2.5 (SD) times (range 0 to 11) during the first 24 hours after birth, and this frequency increased significantly to 7.4 +/- 3.9 times during the next 24 hours (P less than .001). There was a significant correlation between the frequency of breast-feeding during the first and second 24 hours after birth (r = .69, P less than .001). The frequency of breast-feeding during the first 24 hours correlated significantly with frequency of meconium passage (r = .37, P less than .01), maximum weight loss (r = -.22, P less than .05), breast milk intake on day 3 (r = .50, P less than .01) and day 5 (r = .34, P less than .05), transcutaneous bilirubin readings on day 6 (r = -.18, P less than .05), and weight loss from birth to time of discharge (day 7) (r = -.32, P less than .01). There was a strong dose-response relationship between feeding frequency and a decreased incidence of significant hyperbilirubinemia (transcutaneous bilirubin readings greater than or equal to 23.5) on day 6. The time of birth also affected the frequency of breast-feeding during the first 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All infant deaths in North Carolina during a 5-year period (1980 through 1984) were analyzed using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), and a system for linked birth and death records that allows the analysis of birth certificate information on deaths. Causes of death were aggregated based on common etiology such as prematurity or obstetric-related conditions rather than the more traditional organ system taxonomy of the ICD-9 codes. Analyses were carried out separately for very low birth weight (less than or equal to 1500 g), moderately low birth weight (1501 through 2500 g), and normal birth weight (greater than 2500 g) babies. Maternal characteristics identified from the birth certificate were also compared with the different causes of death. Prematurity-related conditions accounted for 37.5% of all deaths, ranking far above the 17.4% for congenital anomalies and 12.9% for sudden infant death syndrome. For normal birth weight babies, sudden infant death syndrome ranked first, followed by congenital anomalies and nonperinatal infections. For the moderately low birth weight babies, congenital anomalies ranked first, with sudden infant death syndrome second and prematurity-related conditions third. For the very low birth weight babies, prematurity-related conditions accounted for nearly 70% of the deaths, with obstetric conditions and congenital anomalies ranking second and third, respectively. Maternal risk factors identified an overrepresentation of nonwhite, unmarried, and young teenage mothers and mothers with less than adequate prenatal care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve infants with BPD, whose postconceptional ages ranged from 40 to 62 weeks, were studied. The mean (+/- SD) gestational age and birth weight was 29 +/- 1.9 weeks and 1289 +/- 376 g, respectively. Elevation infants matched for birth weight, gestational age, and postnatal age served as the control subjects. Blood samples were incubated in an amino acid mixture containing [14C]leucine. The adult hemoglobin and HbF were then separated by column chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex. The results demonstrated that the mean (+/- SD) level of HbF synthesis in infants with BPD was significantly higher than that in the control infants (42.6 +/- 22.9% vs 18.8 +/- 12.8%; P less than .01). When levels of HbF synthesis in the infants with BPD and the control infants were compared with data previously reported in normal infants, 7 of the 12 infants with BPD, but none of the control infants, were synthesizing amounts of HbF greater than would be expected for their postconceptional age. The results suggest that cardiopulmonary insufficiency could stimulate HbF synthesis during the first year of life as a result of an erythropoietic response to hypoxemia.\r"

Most parents (55%) reported that the child slept in their bed at least occasionally and for at least part of the night, particularly during periods of minor stress or disruption of the family routine. The prevalence of cosleeping did not vary by the child's age or sex, but frequent cosleeping (more than once per week) was more common among nonwhite families and single-mother households. Cosleeping was not significantly related to child behavior problems, but frequent cosleepers were more likely to report sleep problems, including difficulty getting to sleep and night waking. Children who were still cosleeping frequently 1 year after the initial assessment maintained high levels of sleep problems, compared with those who stopped cosleeping and non-cosleepers. Cosleeping is common at this age and is not related to general maladjustment. However, frequent cosleeping is closely intertwined with child sleep problems.\r"

Ten infants (mean +/- SD birth weight 825 +/- 265 g, gestation 25.8 +/- 1.9 weeks, postnatal age 33.1 +/- 17.7 days) initially received intravenous dexamethasone, 0.5 mg/kg per day for 3 days, and then were weaned over a period of 45 +/- 19.0 days to a replacement dose, followed by a metyrapone test. Morning plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels were measured before and after an oral metyrapone dose given at midnight. Five infants (group A: birth weight 876 +/- 313 g, gestation 26.2 +/- 1.3 weeks, age of entry 31.8 +/- 22.8 days) had normal metyrapone test results, and five infants (group B: 778 +/- 234 g, 25.4 +/- 2.5 weeks, 34.4 +/- 13.4 days) had suppressed test results.

The children were classified as having cystitis if results of 0 or 1 of the following tests were positive and as having pyelonephritis if results of greater than or equal to 2 tests were positive: (1) temperature greater than 38 degrees C, (2) serum C-reactive protein greater than 1 mg/dL, (3) erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 25 mm/h, and (4) 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin-renal concentrating protein less than 810 mOsm/kg. Urinary NAG to creatinine ratios did not distinguish cases of cystitis from those of pyelonephritis. Urinary NAG was useful in identifying children with cystitis who had vesicoureteral reflux of grades II through V. Of 6 children with cystitis and vesicoureteral reflux, 5 had levels of NAG more than 1 SD above the mean, whereas of 75 children without vesicoureteral reflux, only 15 had such an elevation (P = .003). Of those children with a normal NAG level, 60 (98.4%) had normal radiologic evaluation results, and only 1 child (1.6%) had vesicoureteral reflux. Levels of NAG did not identify children with pyelonephritis who had vesicoureteral reflux. It is concluded that (1) urinary NAG is of no value in localizing the site of urinary tract infection, and (2) an NAG level within 1 SD of the mean in a child with cystitis indicates a low risk of urologic abnormalities, and radiologic evaluation may be omitted unless infection recurs.\r"

Two such patients with protracted, often painful, sickle trait macrohematuria are described. Both patients had normal renal anatomy and vasculature and had failed to respond to bed rest, intravenous hydration, and a trial of oral epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Patient 1 had normal coagulation function. Patient 2 had von Willebrand disease (decreased factor VIII antigen and quantitative ristocetin cofactor activity). Patient 1 responded to intravenous desmopressin acetate at a dose of 0.3 microgram/kg with a 155% increase in factor VIII clotting activity and a 135% increase in ristocetin cofactor and cessation of her macrohematuria within 18 hours after completion of the desmopressin infusion. She remained free of gross hematuria for 5 months with the exception of short-lived trauma-induced hematuria (in three voids) 6 weeks after desmopressin therapy. Patient 2 did not respond to intravenous desmopressin infusion despite a 234% and a 360% increase in factor VIII clotting activity and ristocetin cofactor, respectively. Intravenous desmopressin acetate may be helpful in halting protracted significant macrohematuria associated with sickle trait hemoglobinopathy in some patients when conventional management fails.\r"

The results provide no evidence that sucrose ingestion impairs the performance of juvenile delinquents. In fact, the results of several analyses indicated that the sucrose breakfast was associated with improved performance. In additional analyses the effect of sucrose on particular subgroups of juvenile delinquents was evaluated. Statistical interactions indicated that the performance of delinquents rated as more behaviorally disturbed benefited from sucrose ingestion, whereas those delinquents with less pronounced behavior problems tended to show impaired performance following a sucrose-loaded breakfast. These results indicate that simple statements regarding the effects of sucrose ingestion on behavior are likely to be misleading and highlight the need to consider individual difference variables when investigating the effects of sucrose on juvenile delinquents.\r"

The other five patients with normal gastrointestinal function achieved mean serum concentrations at 1 hour and 2 hours of 4.3 mg/L and 7.3 mg/L, respectively. Delayed gastric emptying and concurrent enteral feedings appear to slow the absorption of carbamazepine. No adverse effects were observed. Rapid loading with carbamazepine suspension appears to be a useful alternative for the management of critically ill pediatric patients who are experienced frequent seizures.\r"

Play behaviors were assessed using structured observations of free-play activities, and imitation skills were measured using a set of 12 individually administered tasks. The autistic group spent less total time interacting with toys and using toys appropriately, engaged in fewer functional play acts, and obtained lower imitation scores compared with all other groups. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the latter three variables discriminated the autistic children from the nonautistic handicapped children, with motor imitation emerging as the most important differentiating measure. These results suggest that measuring play and imitation skills may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of autism.\r"

The newborns with DHB, compared with those without DHB, had received a higher total accumulative dose of chloral hydrate (1035 +/- 286 vs 183 +/- 33 mg/kg [+/- 1 SEM], respectively). In the patients with DHB, the direct serum bilirubin levels increased 6.8 +/- 0.8 days after the chloral hydrate administration began and resolved after the chloral hydrate was discontinued or markedly decreased. These data support the hypothesis that prolonged use of chloral hydrate in newborns can be associated with DHB.\r"

This was due to a significant decrease in stroke volume (32.9%) (P less than .001) in children less than 5 years old. Stroke volume declined slightly even in the older subjects. These changes indicate that the Finnish sauna bath puts great demands on a child's circulatory regulation. To avoid possible cardiovascular side effects, particularly small children should be supervised carefully during sauna bathing.\r"

Data on fathering and infant development were collected during the hospital stay, at discharge, at 8 months of age, and at 18 months of age, using both questionnaires and observational schedules. The frequency of visits was significantly correlated with more extensive and positive patterns of fathering at discharge and later periods. It was also associated with more positive perceptions of the infant, as well as with weight gain during hospitalization and psychosocial aspects of later infant development during the first 18 months. The discussion emphasized possible ways in which early paternal contact in the hospital might influence fathers, mothers, and infants. The frequency of paternal visits was high-lighted as a variable useful in predicting high-risk parenting.\r"

In an effort to minimize such complications, patients with Pierre Robin sequence were examined prospectively by a multidisciplinary team using polysomnography and continuous oximetry. Obstructive apnea and desaturation occurred in 18 of the 21 patients studied. Four children required only home apnea monitoring, and six required only monitoring and supplemental oxygen. Seven children had lip-tongue adhesion procedures performed, and four required tracheostomy. No patients died. All patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence had normal development at follow-up except for one child who had experienced a respiratory arrest before referral. With improvements in neonatal intensive care, testing for respiratory assessment, improved surgical and postoperative intervention and home monitoring, the morbidity and mortality for children with Pierre Robin sequence can be reduced markedly.\r"

The purpose was to plan better for preventive programs and to help rural health care providers prepare better for these difficult patients. Patients entered in the study had either cardiorespiratory arrest or respiratory arrest. Although the distribution by age was similar to studies from other areas, the outcome for cardiorespiratory arrests was as bad or worse (70 arrests with 3 survivors), and the outcome of respiratory arrests was as good or better (25 arrests with 21 survivors) as reported previously. Survival of arrest from trauma and accidents was markedly worse (16%) than survival from nontraumatic arrests (44%). The etiologies of the arrests were dominated by sudden infant death syndrome and pulmonary disease but with very few drownings or farm-related fatalities. This study should encourage rural health care providers to increase efforts in specific areas of trauma and accident prevention. Also, respiratory illness needs to be monitored aggressively and respiratory arrests treated more effectively to avoid the much more consistently lethal cardiac arrests. In addition, more careful prospective study of these patients may be able to identify care patterns that can be improved to increase survival in these groups.\r"

The patient had received seven of these doses over three and one half days prior to arrival at the emergency department. The patient received 40 mg of digoxin immune Fab fragments over one hour to bind a calculated maximum digoxin dose of 600 micrograms. The only complication was a transient episode of relative hypoglycemia 13 to 22 hours postinfusion with measured glucose readings between 43 and 52 mg/dl. The hypoglycemia responded to supplemental glucose and advancement of feedings. We believe that in massive and rapid electrolyte shifts in the neonate caused by digoxin immune Fab, glucose should be monitored closely.\r"

The transport physician made a determination of need for a physician based on data available prior to transport (preassessment). After the transport was completed, the physician made a retrospective determination of actual need for a physician (postassessment). Over a period of eight months, 148 questionnaires were analyzed. In 108 transports (73%), there was minimal or no change in need for a physician between the pre- and posttransport assessments. Therefore, an accurate prediction of need for a physician was possible in advance. Of the remaining transports in which the determination was significantly changed, 37 (25%) indicated a decrease in actual need for a physician after completion of the transport. There was a significant increase over the prediction in the actual need for a physician in only three cases (2%).\r"

We tried to identify neonates at risk among the population of the Negev district of Israel. Ninety-one infant hospitalized with infantile hypothermia (IH) during the years 1974 to 1981 were identified. The neonates belonged to two distinct ethnic groups, Bedouins and Jews, and were compared with 120 healthy controls of similar background. Our data show that premature infants and babies with low birth weight born during the cold season to young (inexperienced) mothers of lower socioeconomic strata and who sustained perinatal morbidity are at risk for IH. It is suggested that parents of infants at risk should be approached while the baby is till in the nursery, be advised about the possibility of hypothermia, and institute the appropriate preventive measures.\r"

No solvent molecules have been included in the refinement. This structure shows large quaternary and tertiary conformational changes from the structures of the unligated enzyme or its fructose 2,6-bisphosphate complex, but the secondary structures remain essentially the same. Dimer C3-C4 of the enzyme-fructose 6-phosphate-AMP-Mg2+ complex twists about 19 degrees relative to the same dimer of the enzyme-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate complex if their C1-C2 dimers are superimposed on one another. Nevertheless, many interfacial interactions between dimers of C1-C2 and C3-C4 are conserved after quaternary structure changes occur.

Moreover, the frequency of this alpha-chain expression was greater than 1.5% of the total alpha chains found in laboratory strains, including B10 congenic mice. This is about 10(4) times higher than was expected. The V14J281 alpha-chain expression was relatively low but was significant in CD4+/CD8+ immature thymocytes and became quite high in mature single-positive T cells, implying that this alpha chain is selected during T-cell maturation. V14J281 expression increased with time after birth and reached a maximum at around 5 weeks of age. The ligand seems to be a self molecule and to be present in laboratory strains but to be absent in a wild mouse, Mus musculus molossinus, because bone marrow chimeras clearly showed that bone marrow cells derived from Mus musculus molossinus negative for this alpha chain raised V14J281-positive T cells in a C57BL/6 environment. The above results suggest that there are some selection mechanisms for this cell type other than those for conventional alpha beta T cells and also that the homogenous VJ junction of the V14J281 alpha chain plays a pivotal role in the selection of the T cell and its ligand reactivity.\r"

The two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the CREB isoforms. We show that both CREB isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species. Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a cAMP response element in vitro. As expected for proteins of this class, the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers. Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CREB. The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that CREB proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription.\r"

The presence of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Both mass spectroscopic and radiometric techniques indicated that the concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam and diazepam in brain extracts from encephalopathic rats were 2-9 and 5-7 times higher, respectively, than in control brain extracts. While benzodiazepines have been identified previously in mammalian and plant tissues, this report demonstrates that concentrations of these substances are increased in a pathophysiological condition. These findings provide a rational basis for the use of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists in the management of hepatic encephalopathy in humans.\r"

  ".W": "In herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells, the first set of genes to be expressed (alpha genes) is induced by the alpha gene trans-inducing factor (alpha TIF), a virion structural protein. The cis-acting site in the 5' untranscribed domain of alpha genes was previously reported to be the sequence 5'-GYATGNTAATGARATTCYTTGNGGG noncoding (where Y is a pyrimidine, R is a purine, N is any base), which binds a host protein designated alpha H1 (also termed the octamer binding protein, OTF-1, Oct-1, etc.) and which, together with this and possibly other proteins, forms complexes with alpha TIF. To determine the role of the various components of this cis-acting site and of other sequences shared by the alpha genes, we constructed 17 mutants spanning 110 nucleotides of the promoter domain of the alpha 27 gene and made a series of chimeric genes. Each chimeric gene embodying one set of these mutations was inserted into the viral genome and measurements were made of (i) accumulated mRNA under conditions in which only alpha genes were expressed and (ii) the capacity of the mutated sequence to form complexes containing alpha TIF and alpha H1 proteins. We report that (i) transversions in the \"TAAT\" sequence abolished both complex formation and induction of the chimeric alpha gene, (ii) mutations in the octamer binding site sequence upstream from TAAT or of the downstream GARAT abolished alpha TIF complex formation and also reduced alpha mRNA accumulation, (iii) mutations in a \"CAAT\" box also reduced expression of mRNA without affecting the formation of DNA-protein complexes containing alpha TIF, and (iv) mutations in sequences immediately downstream from TAATGARAT and in a pair of GA-rich elements reduced alpha mRNA expression whereas mutations between these elements had no effect on the accumulation of the mRNA. The results are consistent with the conclusion that both the alpha H1 octamer binding site ATGNTAAT and the GARAT sequence play a significant role in the induction of alpha genes. For optimal gene expression, however, additional elements downstream from the GARAT sequence and in other regions of the alpha promoter must be present.\r"

Expression of a full-length mouse AE2 cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in chloride- and bicarbonate-dependent alterations in intracellular pH, demonstrating that AE2 is a Cl/HCO3 exchanger. Cation replacement studies indicate that AE2-mediated exchange is independent of extracellular sodium. COS-7 cells expressing a mutant rat AE2 cDNA clone that lacks the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal 660 amino acids exhibit identical responses to cation and anion substitution. These results indicate that this domain does not play a significant role in either correct insertion of the transporter into the plasma membrane or anion exchange.\r"

Immobilized anti-CD3 antibody, recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), and recombinant interleukin 4 (IL-4) all induced proliferation of the T helper type 2 clones 10-5-17 and D10. Proliferation of these clones induced by anti-CD3 antibody was completely inhibited by cyclosporine A, whereas cyclosporine A had little effect on proliferation induced by recombinant IL-2 or recombinant IL-4. Both immobilized anti-CD3 antibody, and recombinant IL-2 induced the expression of the protooncogenes c-myc and c-myb. Immobilized anti-CD3 antibody also induced expression of the lymphokine genes IL-4, interleukin 5 (IL-5), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, recombinant IL-2 induced IL-5 mRNA expression but did not induce detectable expression of IL-4 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA. Likewise, recombinant IL-4 induced expression of IL-5 but not IL-4 mRNA. Thus, the IL-4 and IL-5 genes appear to be differentially regulated after stimulation with recombinant lymphokines. Effects of cyclosporine A and the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin on IL-4 and IL-5 gene expression suggest that these genes are activated by different pathways after anti-CD3 stimulation. Cyclosporine A completely inhibited anti-CD3-induced expression of IL-4 mRNA but not of IL-5 mRNA, and protein-synthesis inhibitors completely inhibited induction of IL-5 mRNA but not of IL-4 mRNA. Together, our data show that T-cell receptor-mediated and lymphokine receptor-mediated signals induce different patterns of lymphokine gene expression and provide strong evidence that the IL-4 and IL-5 genes are differently regulated.\r"

  ".W": "Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is used to determine the amount of carcinogen covalently bound to mouse liver DNA (DNA adduct) following very low-level exposure to a 14C-labeled carcinogen. AMS is a highly sensitive method for counting long-lived but rare cosmogenic isotopes. While AMS is a tool of importance in the earth sciences, it has not been applied in biomedical research. The ability of AMS to assay rare isotope concentrations (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 41Ca, and 129I) in microgram amounts suggests that extension to the biomedical sciences is a natural and potentially powerful application of the technology. In this study, the relationship between exposure to low levels of 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl[2-14C]imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and formation of DNA adducts is examined to establish the dynamic range of the technique and the potential sensitivity for biological measurements, as well as to evaluate the relationship between DNA adducts and low-dose carcinogen exposure. Instrument reproducibility in this study is 2%; sensitivity is 1 adduct per 10(11) nucleotides. Formation of adducts is linearly dependent on dose down to an exposure of 500 ng per kg of body weight. With the present measurements, we demonstrate at least 1 order of magnitude improvement over the best adduct detection sensitivity reported to date and 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement over other methods used for adduct measurement. An additional improvement of 2 orders of magnitude in sensitivity is suggested by preliminary experiments to develop bacterial hosts depleted in radiocarbon. Expanded applications involving human subjects, including clinical applications, are now expected because of the great detection sensitivity and small sample size requirements of AMS.\r"

This induction is tissue specific, occurring mainly in the liver parenchymal cells and to a lesser extent in the kidney cortical epithelium. The induction of peroxisomes is associated with a predictable pleiotropic response, characterized by hepatomegaly, and increased activities and mRNA levels of certain peroxisomal enzymes. Using affinity chromatography, we had previously isolated a protein that binds to clofibric acid. We now show that this protein is homologous with the heat shock protein HSP70 family by analysis of amino acid sequences of isolated peptides from trypsin-treated clofibric acid binding protein and by cross-reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against the conserved region of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins. The clofibric acid-Sepharose column could bind HSP70 proteins isolated from various species, which could then be eluted with either clofibric acid or ATP. Conversely, when a rat liver cytosol containing multiple members of the HSP70 family was passed through an ATP-agarose column, and eluted with clofibric acid, only P72 (HSC70) was eluted. These results suggest that clofibric acid, a peroxisome proliferator, preferentially interacts with P72 at or near the ATP binding site.\r"

Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I cannot substitute for eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II in the supercoiling reaction.

When DNA topoisomerase I is subsequently added to the supercoiling reaction mixture, the supercoiled DNA becomes relaxed.

The intron/exon boundaries were determined by direct comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences. A putative promoter region (\"TATA\" box, reversed \"CAAT\" box) 100 bp 5' to the translational initiation codon strongly suggests the presence of a functional gene. The 3' flanking region carries the polyadenylylation signal (AATAAA) and several conserved structures for the 3' splicing of the pre-mRNA. A comparison of the gene architecture of the subunit e gene with the three-dimensional structure of the arthropod hemocyanin subunit shows a good correspondence with the division of the subunit into three domains (two exons coding for the first, three coding for the second, and four coding for the third domain). The relationship to molluscan hemocyanins, different tyrosinases, and the larval serum proteins is discussed.\r"

In this report we investigate the timing and mode of transfer by examining chloroplast and nuclear DNA from the three major classes of green algae, with emphasis on the class Charophyceae, the proposed sister group to land plants. Filter hybridizations reveal a chloroplast tufA gene in all Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae and in some but not all Charophyceae. One charophycean alga, Coleochaete orbicularis, is shown to contain an intact but highly divergent chloroplast tufA gene, whose product is predicted to be non-functional in protein synthesis. We propose that a copy of the tufA gene was functionally transferred from the chloroplast to the nucleus early in the evolution of the Charophyceae, with chloroplast copies of varying function being retained in some but not all of the subsequently diverging lineages. This proposal is supported by the demonstration of multiple tufA-like sequences in Coleochaete nuclear DNA and in nuclear DNA from all other Charophyceae examined.\r"

The transformed phenotype of chimeric signal peptide-bFGF (spbFGF) cells is characterized by an enhanced proliferation rate compared to parental NIH 3T3 cells, density- and anchorage-independent growth, a transformed morphology, and lack of cell adhesion. The rate of spbFGF cell proliferation is not diminished by anti-bFGF neutralizing antibodies. 125I-labeled bFGF receptor cross-linking and binding studies suggest that surface FGF receptors in spbFGF cells are unavailable and down-regulated. The FGF receptors are also down-regulated in K-fgf-transformed cells but not in parental 3T3, native bFGF-transfected, and ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The addition of suramin to spbFGF and K-fgf cells rapidly promotes the up-regulation of FGF receptors. Suramin also induces lowering of the proliferation rate to that of parental cells, anchorage-dependent growth, assembly of cytoskeletal filaments, cellular adhesion, and spreading. These results suggest that spbFGF cells undergo autocrine transformation, possibly by an internal autocrine loop, in which there is constitutive activation of the FGF receptor. Suramin inhibits autocrine transformation, leading to a normal untransformed phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "cDNAs for another beta subunit of the integrin family were isolated with the aid of polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The combined cDNA sequence is 3110 base pairs (bp) in size and has one long open reading frame of 2388 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to those of other integrin beta subunits but does not correspond to beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, or beta 4 subunits. This beta subunit is divided by a membrane-spanning domain into a large extracellular domain at the N-terminal side and a small intracellular domain at the C-terminal side. The extracellular domain has a cysteine-rich region that contains four repeats of 8-cysteine motifs. All 56 cysteine residues found in the extracellular domains of other mature beta subunits are present in this beta subunit. The beta subunit reported here has particularly high homology with the beta 3 subunit. The mRNA for the molecule is approximately 3.5 kbp in size and is expressed in various cell types. Other researchers have recently reported additional beta subunits that associate with the vitronectin receptor alpha subunit. The deduced amino acid sequence of this molecule contains the N-terminal partial amino acid sequence of one of these beta subunits, beta x. The beta subunit described herein seems to be identical to the beta x subunit and to function as the beta subunit of a vitronectin receptor.\r"

We have now compared the properties of locally evoked miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons and in thin hippocampal slices using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The variability in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current size was similar in both preparations and occurred in cultured neurons when only one or a few synaptic boutons were stimulated. Thus, the variability in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude is not an artifact of cultured neurons and arises predominantly from variability within a single bouton. Possible origins of this variability are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "O6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by exposure to O6-benzylguanine or the p-chlorobenzyl and p-methylbenzyl analogues. This inactivation was much more rapid than with O6-methylguanine: incubation with 2.5 microM O6-benzylguanine led to more than a 90% loss of activity within 10 min, whereas 0.2 mM O6-methylguanine for 60 min was required for the same reduction. O6-Benzylguanine was highly effective in depleting the alkyltransferase activity of cultured human colon tumor (HT29) cells. Complete loss of activity was produced within 15 min after addition of O6-benzylguanine to the culture medium and a maximal effect was obtained with 5 microM. In contrast, at least 100 microM O6-methylguanine for 4 hr was needed to get a maximal effect, and this reduced the alkyltransferase by only 80%. Pretreatment of HT29 cells with 10 microM O6-benzylguanine for 2 hr led to a dramatic increase in the cytotoxicity produced by the chemotherapeutic agents 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) or 2-chloroethyl(methysulfonyl)methanesulfonate (Clomesone). Administration of O6-benzylguanine to mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg reduced alkyltransferase levels by more than 95% in both liver and kidney. These results indicate that depletion of the alkyltransferase by O6-benzylguanine may be used to investigate the role of the DNA repair protein in carcinogenesis and mutagenesis and that this treatment may be valuable to increase the chemotherapeutic effectiveness of chloroethylating agents.\r"

Site-directed mutations and changes in spacing between cis elements were measured in transient expression assays in parsley protoplasts. Clustered point mutations allowed assignment of functional borders. Single-base substitutions within a highly conserved cis element (box II/G box) defined a critical core of seven bases, 5'-ACGTGGC-3'. It is functionally equivalent to a second sequence-related element (box III), which could replace box II in an orientation-dependent manner. The activity of box II required the presence of another juxtaposed element (box I) at a defined distance. No distance requirement was observed between the two large separable promoter regions known to independently confer light-regulated expression. These data support our hypothesis that a cis-acting sequence that is present in a limited number of diversely regulated plant genes gains its functional capacity and specificity by combinatorial diversity involving flanking partner elements.\r"

This response element consists of a direct repeat of the sequence GTTCAC, separated by five nucleotides. Direct binding of the RAR to this sequence was demonstrated by gel retardation and immunoprecipitation assays. This element conferred retinoic acid responsiveness on heterologous promoters via all three subtypes of RAR yet failed to support transcriptional activation by the thyroid hormone, estrogen, glucocorticoid, or vitamin D receptors. Surprisingly, a high level of retinoic acid-dependent activation was seen in the absence of transfected RAR in 10 of 10 vertebrate cell lines, many functionally characterized previously as lacking endogenous receptor. This demonstrates an unusually high sensitivity of the retinoic acid response element to low levels of receptor and suggests expression of RAR in a wide variety of tissue types.\r"

By using reversed-phase HPLC and a chiral mobile phase, it was shown that the 3-phenyllactyl group had the L configuration. Immunocytochemical staining with antiserum against Arg-Asn-NH2 showed that L-3-phenyllactyl-Leu-Arg-Asn-NH2 (Antho-RNamide) was localized in neurons of sea anemones. The L-3-phenyllactyl group has not been found earlier in neuropeptides of vertebrates or higher invertebrates. We propose that this residue renders Antho-RNamide resistant to nonspecific aminopeptidases, thereby increasing the stability of the peptide after neuronal release.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumococcal strains with greatly elevated levels of resistance to penicillin have by now been described with increasing frequency worldwide. The mechanism of antibiotic resistance in these strains involves the molecular remodeling of cell wall synthetic enzymes (penicillin binding proteins). We have now analyzed the peptidoglycan structures of 10 penicillin-susceptible and 10 penicillin-resistant clinical isolates (4 of intermediate and 6 of high level resistance) with a high-resolution HPLC technique. Cell wall peptidoglycan of the susceptible strains contained monomeric and oligomeric forms of primarily (70% or more) linear stem peptides with the sequence of L-Ala-D-iGln-L-Lys-D-Ala (where iGln is isoglutamine). In contrast, the major peptide species (70% or more) of resistant cell walls were abnormal branched-stem peptides carrying Ala-Ser or Ala-Ala dipeptides on the epsilon-amino groups of the stem peptide lysine residues. The structural alteration in the peptidoglycan was not related to serotype, date, or site of isolation but showed strong correlation with penicillin resistance and was cotransformed with high-level penicillin resistance during genetic transformation. We suggest that the remodeling of the active site of penicillin binding proteins in the resistant bacteria, which results in the reduced affinity for penicillin, also changes the substrate preference of these enzymes for the more hydrophobic branched peptides (instead of linear peptides) for cell wall synthesis.\r"

Lymphocytes infected with HIV in vitro or in vivo were detected by fluorescence after hybridization with either biotin or digoxigenin-labeled probes. At 12 hr after infection in vitro, a single intense signal appeared in the nuclei of individual cells. Later in infection, when cytoplasmic fluorescence became intense, multiple nuclear foci frequently appeared. The nuclear focus consisted of newly synthesized HIV RNA as shown by hybridization in the absence of denaturation and by susceptibility to RNase and actinomycin D. Virus was detected in patient lymphocytes and it was shown that a singular nuclear focus also characterizes cells infected in vivo. The cell line 8E5/LAV containing one defective integrated provirus revealed a similar focus of nuclear RNA, and the single integrated HIV genome was unequivocally visualized on a D-group chromosome. This demonstrates an extremely sensitive single-cell assay for the presence of a single site of HIV transcription in vitro and in vivo and suggests that it derives from one (or very few) viral genomes per cell. In contrast, productive Epstein-Barr virus infection exhibited many foci of nuclear RNA per cell.\r"

  ".U": "90319129\r", 
  ".W": "An inborn deficiency in the ability of aldolase B to split fructose 1-phosphate is found in humans with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). A stable isotope procedure to elucidate the mechanism of conversion of fructose to glucose in normal children and in HFI children has been developed. A constant infusion of D-[U-13C]fructose was given nasogastrically to control and to HFI children. Hepatic fructose conversion to glucose was estimated by examination of 13C NMR spectra of plasma glucose. The conversion parameters in the control and HFI children were estimated on the basis of doublet/singlet values of the plasma beta-glucose C-1 splitting pattern as a function of the rate of fructose infusion (0.26-0.5 mg/kg per min). Significantly lower values (approximately 3-fold) for fructose conversion to glucose were obtained for the HFI patients as compared to the controls. A quantitative determination of the metabolic pathways of fructose conversion to glucose was derived from 13C NMR measurement of plasma [13C]glucose isotopomer populations. The finding of isotopomer populations of three adjacent 13C atoms at glucose C-4 (13C3-13C4-13C5) suggests that there is a direct pathway from fructose, by-passing fructose-1-phosphate aldolase, to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The metabolism of fructose by fructose-1-phosphate aldolase activity accounts for only approximately 50% of the total amount of hepatic fructose conversion to glucose. It is suggested that phosphorylation of fructose 1-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by 1-phosphofructokinase occurs in human liver (and intestine) when fructose is administered nasogastrically; 47% and 27% of the total fructose conversion to glucose in controls and in HFI children, respectively, takes place by way of this pathway. In view of the marked decline by 67% in synthesis of glucose from fructose in HFI subjects found in this study, the extent of [13C]glucose formation from a \"trace\" amount (approximately 20 mg/kg) of [U-13C]fructose infused into the patient can be used as a safe and noninvasive diagnostic test for inherent faulty fructose metabolism.\r"

The amplified DNA included a product with significant similarity to NGF and BDNF, which was used to isolate a 1020-nucleotide-long cDNA from a rat hippocampal library. From the nucleotide sequence, a 282-amino-acid-long protein with approximately 45% amino acid similarity to both pig BDNF and rat NGF was deduced. In the adult brain, the mRNA for this protein was predominantly expressed in hippocampus, where it was confined to a subset of pyramidal and granular neurons. The developmental expression in brain showed a clear peak shortly after birth, 1 and 2 weeks earlier than maximal expression of BDNF and NGF, respectively. It was also expressed in several peripheral tissues with the highest level in kidney. The protein, transiently expressed in COS cells, was tested on chicken embryonic neurons and readily stimulated fiber outgrowth from explanted Remak's ganglion and, to a lesser extent, the nodose ganglion. A weak, but consistent, fiber outgrowth response was also seen in the ciliary ganglion and in paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. Moreover, the protein displaced binding of NGF to its receptor, suggesting that it can interact with the NGF receptor. Thus, this factor, although structurally and functionally related to NGF and BDNF, has unique biological activities and represents a member of a family of neurotrophic factors that may cooperate to support the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system.\r"

We obtained, in addition, four frameshift and four complex mutations. The preferred type of mutation was transversion (A.T----T.A and G.C----T.A) occurring in 69% of the analyzed mutants. A purine was on the 3' side of the putative adduct site in every mutant. Mutations were favored at sequences AGG, CAG, and AAG (the underlined base is the target). Surprisingly, 42% of the mutations created mRNA splicing defects (16/38), especially at splice acceptor sites for each of the five introns.

Disruption of the stress fiber network is also accompanied by shape changes in the cell that resemble those seen after cytochalasin treatment. When DBP was coinjected with fluorescently labeled alpha-actinin, no fluorescent stress fibers or attachment plaques were visible 30 min after injection. Twelve hours later the cells regained their flattened shape and their stress fibers. Fluorescently labeled DBP causes the same reversible changes in cell shape as the unlabeled protein. Upon injection, the labeled DBP diffuses throughout the cytoplasm, becoming localized by 12 hr in a punctate pattern, presumably due to lysozomal sequestration. Similar injections of DBP into skeletal myotubes and cardiac myocytes did not lead to shape changes or breakdown of nascent and/or fully formed myofibrils, even though DBP has a 2-fold higher binding affinity for muscle actin over that of the nonmuscle isoactins. Similar differential effects in nonmuscle cells were also observed after the microinjection of DNase I, another protein capable of binding monomer actin. The effects of these microinjected monomer actin-binding proteins imply that an accessible pool of monomer actin is needed to maintain stress fiber integrity in nonmuscle cells but not the integrity of the nascent or fully formed myofibrils in muscle cells.\r"

Of particular interest, the alcohol-inducible form of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 3a (P-450 IIE1) is the most active of the isozymes examined in the reductive beta-scission of the 13-hydroperoxide derived from linoleic acid and the 15-hydroperoxide derived from arachidonic acid as well as the model compounds cumyl hydroperoxide (alpha, alpha-dimethylbenzyl hydroperoxide) and t-butyl hydroperoxide. In general, the forms of P-450 with lower activity, as judged by the rate of NADPH oxidation in the reconstituted system, give less of the cleavage products (hydrocarbon and oxo compound) and catalyze direct reduction of the hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. The occurrence of the reductive cleavage reaction in liver microsomal membranes was demonstrated, and microsomes from animals treated with ethanol or acetone (P-450 IIE1 inducers) or phenobarbital (a P-450 IIB4 inducer) were more active than those from untreated animals. We suggest that the alcohol-inducible P-450, in addition to its known deleterious effects in chemical toxicity and chemical carcinogenesis, may enhance the reductive cleavage of lipid hydroperoxides with a resultant loss in membrane integrity.\r"

  ".W": "The effect on immunogenicity of coupling the immunostimulatory nonapeptide sequence (residues 163-171) from human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) to a small immunogen was examined. A 21-amino acid sequence spanning positions 12-32 on the large protein of hepatitis B surface antigen was chosen as a model. Three peptides were synthesized corresponding to the IL-1 beta-derived sequence [peptide IL-(163-171)], the hepatitis B surface antigen-derived sequence [peptide S1-(12-32)] and a composite peptide that included both these sequences separated by a spacer of two glycine residues [peptide S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171)]. In an in vitro thymocyte proliferation assay, both peptides S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171) and IL-(163-171) showed comparable activity, whereas peptide S1-(12-32) was inactive. Groups of five to seven mice each from C3H/CH, BALB/c, SJL/J, and C57BL/6 strains were immunized with equimolar amounts of either peptide S1-(12-32), peptide S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171), or a mixture of peptides S1-(12-32) and IL-(163-171), and sera were screened for anti-S1-(12-32) antibodies. In all strains, peptide S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171) elicited an increased primary and secondary anti-S1-(12-32) antibody response compared to the other two groups. Further, peptide S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171) also induced an increased number of responders to primary immunization, though the number of responders was quantitative in all groups following secondary immunization. At least part of the enhanced immunogenicity of the S1-(12-32) sequence in peptide S1-(12-32)-IL-(163-171) appears to be due to augmented T-helper cell activity. These results suggest that coupling of the immunostimulatory IL-1 beta-derived sequence in tandem with an immunogen may confer inbuilt adjuvanticity.\r"

  ".U": "90319147\r", 
  ".W": "To study the orientation of spin-labeled myosin heads in the first few seconds after the production of saturating ATP, we have used a laser flash to photolyze caged ATP during EPR data acquisition. Rabbit psoas muscle fibers were labeled with maleimide spin label, modifying 60% of the myosin heads without impairing muscle fiber biochemical and physiological activity (ATPase and force). The muscle bundles were incubated for 30 min with 5 mM caged ATP prior to the UV flash. The flash, from an excimer laser, liberated 2-3 mM ATP, generating maximum force in the presence of Ca2+ and relaxing fully in the absence of Ca2+. Control experiments, using fibers decorated with labeled myosin subfragment, showed that the flash liberates sufficient ATP to saturate myosin active sites in all regions of the muscle bundles. To increase the time resolution, and to minimize the time of the contraction, we followed in time the intensity at a single spectral position (P2), which is associated with the high degree of orientational order in rigor. ATP liberation produced a rapid decrease of P2 with liberation of ATP, indicating a large decrease in orientational order in both relaxation and contraction. This transient was absent when caged AMP was used, ruling out nonspecific effects of the UV flash and subsequent photochemistry. The steady-state level of P2 during contraction was almost as low as that reached in relaxation, although the duration of the steady state was much more brief in contraction. Upon depletion of ATP in contraction, the P2 intensity reverted to the original rigor level, accompanied by development of rigor tension. The steady-state results obtained in the brief contractions induced by caged ATP are quantitatively consistent with those obtained in longer contractions by continuously perfusing fibers with ATP. In isometric contraction, most (88% +/- 4%) of the heads are in a population characterized by a high degree of axial disorder, comparable to that observed for all heads in relaxation. Since the stiffness of these fibers in contraction is 80% of the stiffness in rigor, it is likely that most of the heads in this highly disoriented population are attached to actin in contraction and that most actin-attached heads in contraction are in this disoriented population.\r"

Type 1 transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) inhibited the growth of A549 or B16 cells under serum-free conditions or in the presence of 10% serum by 15-33%. In contrast, in the presence of micrograms/ml concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta 1 irreversibly inhibited the serum-free growth of A549 or B16 cells by 90-100%. The PUFAs alone had little effect on cell growth. Cell growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 was not potentiated by saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, or prostaglandins. Inhibition of A549 or B16 cell growth by TGF-beta 1 in the presence of PUFAs was almost completely reversed by the antioxidant vitamin E, suggesting a role for lipid peroxidation in this process. Inhibition of A549 or B16 cell growth by TGF-beta 1 in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum was also potentiated by PUFAs and partially reversed by antioxidants. The presence of retinoic acid was required for maximal PUFA-dependent growth inhibition of A549 or B16 cells by TGF-beta 1 under some, but not all, conditions. These results suggest that inhibition of carcinoma and melanoma cell growth by TGF-beta 1 is mediated, in large part, by PUFAs.\r"

In functional studies of antigen processing by elicited peritoneal macrophages, MHC-II-peptide complexes were formed intracellularly. Immunogenic peptides were not released to bind surface MHC-II molecules. Ultrastructural studies employing immunogold staining in ultrathin cryosections of these macrophages showed large amounts of MHC-II molecules in intracellular sac-like vacuoles in the peripheral cytoplasm; most of these were negative for the lamp 1 lysosomal/endosomal membrane protein and cathepsin D. MHC-II molecules were also present in endosomes containing cathepsin D and lamp 1 as well as previously internalized gold-transferrin. The intracellular pool of MHC-II molecules was only slightly decreased by treatment with cycloheximide for 3 hr, indicating that it consisted mainly of endocytosed, recycling molecules, as opposed to nascent ones. These ultrastructural studies support the notion that there is endocytosis of MHC-II molecules into endocytic compartments, consistent with our earlier biochemical data. Furthermore, we have defined the distinct endocytic compartments that must mediate important functions in antigen processing, including the formation of MHC-II-peptide complexes.\r"

When the animals were rechallenged with live virus after cessation of therapy, 96% were resistant. The nature of this protective immune response was analyzed: Passive serotherapy of naive mice challenged subsequently with Rauscher murine leukemia virus was only protective at a high dose of immune serum. Immune, but not naive, T cells alone were fully protective against virus challenge. We conclude that vaccination with a live retrovirus that cannot replicate because of pharmacological blockade induces a T-cell response capable of protecting against a lethal retrovirus-induced disease.\r"

We report here that a Mr 56,000 protein found on mouse sperm has properties expected for a sperm component that recognizes and binds to ZP3. This sperm protein is radiolabeled preferentially by a photoactivatable heterobifunctional crosslinker (\"Denny-Jaffee reagent\") covalently linked to purified ZP3, binds very tightly to ZP3-affinity columns, and is localized to heads of acrosome-intact but not acrosome-reacted sperm. These and other findings suggest that this protein may be a \"ZP3-binding protein\" that, together with the sperm receptor, supports species-specific binding of mouse sperm to unfertilized eggs.\r"

The paramedian lobule is activated during limb movements used in both acrobatic training and physical exercise. Acrobatic animals had greater numbers of synapses per Purkinje cell than animals from the exercise or inactive groups. No significant difference in synapse number or size between the exercised and inactive groups was found. This indicates that motor learning required of the acrobatic animals, and not repetitive use of synapses during physical exercise, generates new synapses in cerebellar cortex. In contrast, exercise animals had a greater density of blood vessels in the molecular layer than did either the acrobatic or inactive animals, suggesting that increased synaptic activity elicited compensatory angiogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The complement system is an important mediator of the acute inflammatory response, and an effective inhibitor would suppress tissue damage in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Such an inhibitor might be found among the endogenous regulatory proteins of complement that block the enzymes that activate C3 and C5. Of these proteins, complement receptor type 1 (CR1; CD35) has the most inhibitory potential, but its restriction to a few cell types limits its function in vivo. This limitation was overcome by the recombinant, soluble human CR1, sCR1, which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The sCR1 bivalently bound dimeric forms of its ligands, C3b and methylamine-treated C4 (C4-ma), and promoted their inactivation by factor I. In nanomolar concentrations, sCR1 blocked complement activation in human serum by the two pathways. The sCR1 had complement inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities in a rat model of reperfusion injury of ischemic myocardium, reducing myocardial infarction size by 44 percent. These findings identify sCR1 as a potential agent for the suppression of complement-dependent tissue injury in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\r"

Hybridomas without zeta and eta were reconstituted with mutated zeta chains. Cytoplasmic truncations of up to 40% of the zeta molecule reconstituted normal surface assembly of TCRs, but antigen-induced IL-2 secretion and growth inhibition were lost. In contrast, cross-linking antibodies to the TCR activated these cells. A point mutation conferred the same signaling phenotype as did the truncations and caused defective antigen-induced tyrosine kinase activation. Thus zeta allows the binding of antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to alpha beta to effect TCR signaling.\r"

The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) and a demographic questionnaire were mailed to patient-led support groups for women who had poorly assimilated a previous abortion experience. Of the 150 surveys mailed, 71 (47%) were returned. Thirty-three women (46%) stated they had changed to a Fundamentalist or Evangelical church. On the MCMI, members of these conservative denominations scored significantly lower on the subscales for passive-aggressive behavior, ethanol abuse, and avoidance. Religion was strongly perceived by the women as playing a healing role. These findings suggest that conservative personal values may be more critical in understanding attitudes toward abortion than other demographic characteristics. Previous follow-up studies that reported no change in postabortion religiosity may have been too short to detect changes in religion. Implications for treatment of postabortion dysphoria include sensitivity to patients' religious beliefs, with support for the healing aspects of their religion.\r"

To evaluate Mg status in our patients, we measured the percentage retention of a parenterally administered Mg load as an accurate indicator of functionally available total body Mg. Serum lipid, blood chemistry, and serum Mg values were obtained, and cardiac exercise testing and Holter monitoring were done. Levels of potassium were lower, but those of serum Mg were higher with HCTZ treatment despite double the Mg load retention. The Mg load retention data indicate relative Mg depletion in the HCTZ-treated group. Eighty percent of all patients studied had abnormal retention of Mg, even though their serum levels were normal. A percentage Mg load retention determination is needed to assess accurately Mg status.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the ability of commonly used clinical features to predict the presence of renal artery stenosis in 100 hypertensive adults. All subjects had conventional renal arteriography. Renal artery stenosis was diagnosed if there was 50% or more stenosis of a main renal artery. Eighteen of the 100 had renal artery stenosis. The presence of a bruit was strongly associated with renal artery stenosis (P less than .0005). In patients without a bruit, only refractory hypertension was associated with the presence of renal artery stenosis (P = .051). These data suggest that a bruit and refractory hypertension are associated with renal artery stenosis, but that other clinical features investigated may not be and that other means of screening for renovascular disease are needed.\r"

The portable recorder measured nasal/oral airflow, chest wall movement, cardiac rhythm, and blood oxygen saturation. There was no significant difference in the number of disordered breathing events (apneas and hypopneas) recorded by the two systems. The portable device was found to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 96%.

The tendency is to rely on the results of the D&C rather than clinical judgment if the diagnosis is benign. In four of our patients treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, endometrial carcinoma was diagnosed even though earlier histologic examination with D&C had shown benign disease. All patients were 60 years of age or older. Three of the four patients had postmenopausal bleeding, and one patient had a Papanicolaou test that indicated an unexplained abnormality. All patients were obese (weighing more than 250 lb) and hypertensive. Other high-risk factors included diabetes mellitus in three and an elevated tumor marker antigen (CA125) in one. Frozen sections of tissue taken at D&C revealed no malignancy and failed to explain the postmenopausal bleeding. Rather than relying on these results, we assessed the high-risk factors and performed total abdominal hysterectomy immediately on all four patients. The results confirmed endometrial carcinoma. Immediate abdominal hysterectomy saved the patients additional anesthesia and delay in diagnosis.\r"

Patients using the continuous regimen were instructed to apply 5% 5-FU cream to the vulva each night for 6 weeks or until a brisk inflammatory reaction occurred. The periodic regimen consisted of applying 5-FU cream on 2 consecutive nights per week for 10 week. Thirty-five patients (71%) responded to 5-FU treatment (20 complete responses, 41%; 15 partial responses, 30%). Fourteen patients (29%) did not respond. The response rates observed in 19 patients using the continuous regimen (eight complete responses, five partial responses, and six treatment failures) were not significantly different from the response rates obtained in 30 patients with the periodic regimen (12 complete responses, 10 partial responses, and eight treatment failures; P greater than .05, chi-squared test). The periodic regimen caused fewer side effects than the continuous regimen. I conclude that topical 5-FU is effective for treatment of vulvar condylomata acuminata and that periodic applications are preferable to continuous applications.\r"

Thirty-five percent of the patients had a neoplastic lesion greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter on initial colonoscopy. Synchronous or metachronous carcinomas were found in 11 patients; and of these second carcinomas, 82% were localized. The risk of a second carcinoma developing did not correlate with a finding of neoplastic polyps on the initial colonoscopy. Six recurrent carcinomas at the anastomosis were demonstrated. The stage of the recurrence correlated well with the stage of the primary carcinoma. Two negative colonoscopies at 1-year intervals were necessary to ensure that the colon had been cleared of neoplastic lesions. This study shows that surveillance colonoscopy in patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma has a high yield and is capable of detecting localized, asymptomatic carcinoma. After two annual colonoscopies fail to show neoplasms, surveillance colonoscopy may be scheduled at 3- to 5-year intervals.\r"

Variability in the anatomic location of the appendix can be responsible for atypical manifestations of appendicitis and diagnostic errors. Over a 52-month period, 125 appendectomies were done for suspected appendicitis at a military hospital. After excluding cases in which the location of the appendix was not provided, 106 cases were available for review. Fifteen patients (14%) did not have appendicitis. The appendix was found in the true pelvis, was behind the ileum or ileocolic mesentery, or was both retrocolic and retroperitoneal in 11 of 16 patients (69%) with gangrenous or perforative appendicitis. In contrast, the appendix was in one of these three sites in only four of 75 patients (5%) with simple appendicitis (P less than .001). Both physicians and patients were responsible for diagnostic delays, but the paucity of symptoms and signs in patients with a \"hidden\" appendix was the most likely cause of failure to diagnose appendicitis before perforation.\r"

Of those with carcinoma, 83% died of other, unrelated causes; of those who died, 80% had poorly differentiated (grade 3 or 4) tumors. Given the indolent biologic nature of well differentiated tumors in those older than 70 years, prostate carcinoma should not in most instances be regarded as life-threatening with or without treatment in older individuals. The tumor seems to be biologically more aggressive in younger men, especially those younger than 60 years.\r"

The overall mortality was 16%; 43.5% had open fractures, 13.2% had closed fractures, and 30.6% had been in pedestrian accidents. Significant risk factors for mortality were age, blood pressure on admission, associated injuries, and the presence of an open pelvic fracture. It appears that TS alone is not reliable in prehospital triage of patients with pelvic fractures. Age and mechanism of injury may better identify the patient at risk for morbidity and mortality.\r"

Wound beds covered with inverted and collagen matrix grafts contracted at the same rate as full-thickness grafts. Heat denaturation diminished this ability. Partial-thickness grafts derived from papillary or reticular dermis inhibited contraction to an equal degree. Inhibition of contraction appears to relate to the amount of intact dermal collagen matrix transferred, and not to another component of a full-thickness graft.\r"
