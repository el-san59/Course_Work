The clinical context for cholesterol testing is reviewed in order to develop a conceptual framework for analytic goals. Our analysis leads us to the following conclusions: First, the accuracy of cholesterol assays will be improved by using newly available reference material labeled by definitive methodology; this aspect of cholesterol testing is well monitored by proficiency testing. Tight goals for accuracy must await a consensus on the true value of test specimens. Second, long-term intralaboratory analytic variability, which is crucial in cholesterol testing, is well monitored by programs like the Quality Assurance Service, but not by proficiency testing. It is proposed that pathologists use realistic performance goals that incorporate a total error model and biologic variability.\r"

  ".W": "Laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists Enzyme Survey (ES) and Comprehensive Chemistry Survey used diverse methods for the same analyte, resulting in a considerable range of values for the commonly performed enzyme measurements. Nevertheless, with the techniques developed for the ES, both the short-term (within-mailing) and long-term (between-mailings) coefficients of variation (CVs) can be determined. The ten-year experience of the ES has shown improvement in the short-term CV; however, long-term stability of enzyme testing requires more effort on the part of the instrument and reagent suppliers and participating laboratories. A reference material with an International Federation of Clinical Chemistry-established aspartate aminotransferase value, National Bureau of Standards RM 8430, is now available and was sent to three large peer groups as part of a special study. Correction of the results to the RM 8430 aspartate aminotransferase value resulted in reducing the range of data from peers using the duPont aca but not from those using the American Monitor KDA or Technicon SMAC. Based on our experience with the ES, goals of 5% for the short-term CV and 10% for the long-term CV are proposed; they are achievable by most laboratories and meet medical needs for biochemical screening. Fixed criteria for the evaluation of enzyme results appear to be appropriate given the way most enzyme data are used clinically.\r"

The proposed method also provides a mechanism for processing results qualitatively reported as \"less than\" or \"greater than\" pre-established limits of quantitation. The evaluation limits for acceptability are calculated to include the central 95% of all test results from all methods. Systematic differences in the levels of analyte concentrations caused by differences in analytical measurement systems are normalized by mathematically transforming the test results from each analytic method by dividing them by their method-specific group median. This nonparametric method was compared with the traditional mean +/- 2 SD limits using data collected for digoxin, free thyroxine, and quantitative chorionic gonadotropin measurement in the College of American Pathologists Ligand Assay Survey. The nonparametric method more accurately classified 5% of the results as \"unacceptable.\" When more than 2.5% of the test results for a method were designated as \"less than,\" no lower limit was used for evaluation and only 2.5% of results were classified as \"unacceptably high.\" The current College of American Pathologists procedure favors analytical methods with larger coefficients of variation by setting wider limits of acceptability, while the proposed procedure favors methods with smaller coefficients of variation.\r"

A number of strategies have been used to define acceptable standards, or analytical goals, for imprecision, but it does appear that the current widely held view is that imprecision (as SD or coefficient of variation) should be equal to or less than one half of the average intraindividual biological variation. Since the goal for inaccuracy is that results should be unbiased, the biological variation-based goals should be used for total laboratory error. Many data on the biological variation of a wide range of analytes now exist, which facilitates goal-setting. Current proficiency testing schemes generally analyze laboratory data using either a parametric statistical approach or empirical fixed limits of acceptability. The latter strategy appears to have advantages provided that the criteria of acceptability are the objective biological variation-based goals.\r"

This rule may be expressed in terms of a population-based reference range (in particular, the range of test results shown in a group of healthy individuals) and the bias of the test method. The latter is required not to exceed one eighth (0.125) of the reference range. These concepts are applied to eight common analytes for which estimates of the biases of specific methods and of within-laboratory imprecision have been published for large numbers of laboratories participating in recent College of American Pathologists proficiency surveys. Results indicate that some methods widely used in 1978 fail to meet the minimum accuracy criterion, while others show negligible bias. Even neglecting bias, more recent data show that average within-laboratory imprecision is still too high for sodium, chloride, and calcium but acceptable for potassium, glucose, cholesterol, urea, and uric acid.\r"

However, uniform criteria for result accuracy are also required. A clinical statistical model predicting the effect of method error on clinical diagnostic accuracy is proposed. A criterion is proposed for result accuracy defined in terms of uniform clinical benefit. The criterion specifies a fixed error limit for each type of application of a medical test that is appropriate for the inherent variability of the test application. Recent College of American Pathologists Survey experience with clinical fixed limits for allowable analytic error calculated by the model is presented.\r"

  ".W": "Although clinical reasoning may be very complex, it is possible to evaluate the effects of analytical variability and error for an analyte in situations in which clinical decisions are mainly based on the results of quantitative measurements of the specific analytical component. The consequences, or the validating of these consequences, can then define the quality goals for the component in the clinical situation. Two situations are investigated: a bimodal situation, ie, a situation in which the component is used for classifying patients into diagnostic groups and the diagnosis can be confirmed; and a unimodal situation, in which the risk of later development of a certain disease increases with the concentration of the component. The bimodal situation is illustrated by the application of creatine kinase isoenzyme measurements in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and by measurement of blood thyroid-stimulating hormone in screening for congenital hypothyroidism. The unimodal situation is evaluated by serum cholesterol measurement results for identifying individuals at risk regarding ischemic coronary heart disease. It is shown that this system is extremely sensitive to the effects of analytical bias and imprecision. The evaluation of clinical consequences as caused by analytical bias and imprecision makes it possible to define goals for stable analytical performance and for the maximal tolerable unstable performance when the clinical application of the test is well known.\r"

Our previously described computer model emulates the state-of-the-art approach by simulating the performance of 401 laboratories in interlaboratory proficiency testing programs using the 1(2)s rule. The use of fixed limits to evaluate laboratory performance can be simulated by simple probability calculations. We compare the 1(2)s rule and fixed limits on the basis of their ability to identify actual intralaboratory performance correctly using efficiency. In both cases, the maximum efficiency never exceeds 91% and depends on population SD or fixed limit, specific requirements for medical usefulness, and the prevalence (10%) of poorly performing laboratories in the proficiency testing population. This calculation gives some insight into why neither of these approaches adequately differentiates between good and bad intralaboratory performance.\r"

The quality control-derived estimates of analytical bias were larger and level-dependent when compared with the survey results. Possible explanations for these differences include \"matrix effects\" due to glycol stabilization of the control materials studied and analyst bias when testing survey specimens. A number of instruments from the Quality Assurance Service pools failed to meet the allowable analytical error goals for calcium and creatinine that serve as the basis for the \"fixed limits\" evaluation criteria of the survey program. The methods for glucose analysis met the prescribed evaluation limits. Cholesterol analyses need significant improvement to meet the analytical requirements of long-term testing of individuals.\r"

However, relatively low parametric and nonparametric correlation coefficients and significant departure of linear regression slopes from unity reflect major differences in the calculated parameters of absolute bias, precision, and total error obtained through internal and external quality control. Significantly better performance in both Surveys and the Quality Assurance Service was documented for laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists Laboratory Accreditation Program. Multiple descriptors of laboratory quality, as indicated here, are superior in describing laboratory performance to proficiency testing alone. As a bridge between external and internal quality control, shared pools of quality control materials are described for use as unknown Survey challenges and subsequent distribution for regional quality control. Such programs, which can be configured to serve thousands of laboratories, could offer cost savings, better quality assurance, and improved characterization of laboratory performance by minimizing interprogram differences in control matrix and method classification and providing greater reliability of target values.\r"

Because these needs must be met with a very limited amount of information, optimal statistics should be used to measure performance. Since punitive action could result from poor performance, there should be precise quantitative goals that can be measured directly with the performance statistic. Finally, it is important to limit the likelihood of falsely penalizing a laboratory, since the large majority of laboratories are not in need of regulatory action. A statistic is described that measures individual performance on quantitative interlaboratory proficiency tests. This statistic is based on actual error relative to the amount of error that is tolerable. It can be accumulated over several challenges (specimens tested as unknowns) to give an estimate of a participant's performance level for that analyte. It can also be accumulated across analytes to give scores for Survey mailings or for accumulated performance. Because the statistic measures error, it contains more information than does the percentage of acceptable results, and therefore has greater power to detect poor performance. The distribution of the statistic is described and tested for validity. Then, a procedure is presented to evaluate laboratories relative to a performance goal. The entire procedure is then tested with recent College of American Pathologists Chemistry Survey data.\r"

Three groups were formed: a control group who did no exercise (C) (n = 13), a group who exercised with light weights (EW) (n = 17), and a group who exercised with no weights (EN) (n = 16). Subjects who exercised (EN and EW) gained significantly greater ROM in ankle plantar flexion, shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, and left neck rotation than C subjects. No significant differences were found between groups in hip flexion, right neck rotation, wrist flexion or extension, or ankle dorsiflexion. The only difference between exercise treatments was that the EN group gained significantly more ROM in shoulder abduction than the EW. The use of arm weights may have limited shoulder ROM during exercise, resulting in less improvement for shoulder abduction. Comparison with data from other studies suggests age-related loss in flexibility at the shoulder joint. Exercise generally increased shoulder ROM and may be capable of reversing loss in flexibility due to disuse.\r"

Dunn planned contrasts were used to compare C vs exercise groups combined (EN + EW) and EN vs EW. No significant differences were found among groups at baseline. EN + EW improved significantly (p less than 0.05) more than C in elbow extension (17%), shoulder internal rotation (14%), shoulder external rotation (9%), and knee flexion (20%). No significant differences were found between EN and EW. These data indicate that elderly women can achieve substantial gains in the strength of arm and leg musculature as a result of regular light resistance and aerobic exercise, but that the use of light weights on the wrists and ankles for added resistance did not enhance this effect.\r"

No significant changes in mean skeletal muscle fiber area were observed while a significant increase in percent fiber type and percent fiber area was noticed for type IIa fibers. The activities of the enzymes hexokinase, malate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase were also increased significantly. Fifty days without training induced a significant decline in peak torque output. All the enzymes that responded to the first training protocol maintained their elevated activities over the detraining period except for the enzyme oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. A second training protocol administered to the same subjects following the 50-day inactivity period did not result in any significant increase in maximum torque output and fiber area. It is concluded that the isokinetic strength training protocol used can increase the functional capacity of skeletal muscle, but this effect does not appear to be related to skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy.\r"

Bilateral neurogenic leg weakness with muscle wasting on one side and true hypertrophy on the other, however, has rarely been described. We report a 37-year-old heroin and alcohol abuser with a three-year history of weakness of the left leg and progressive enlargement of the right calf. Computed tomography of the right calf confirmed the presence of true hypertrophy. Electromyography showed denervation in the muscles of both legs. Nerve conduction studies were indicative of peripheral neuropathy. Biopsy of the gastrocnemius muscles revealed the presence of neurogenic atrophy on both sides, with marked hypertrophy and splitting of individual muscle fibers on the right. To our knowledge, this is only the second recorded case showing both muscle atrophy and muscle hypertrophy in response to denervation.\r"

There were no follow-up reports and no other cases have been described. A patient is reported with diffuse insertional positive waves. He has been followed for over three years, remaining clinically normal. No electrolyte or metabolic abnormalities have been found. Two of the patient's four children showed normal results to limited EMG screening. This syndrome may represent an intrinsic defect in the muscle fiber cell membrane which makes it inherently unstable. It may also represent a form of myotonia; however, no evidence of that disease was found in this patient. This defect, which can only be detected by needle EMG, has so far not been associated with any neuromuscular deficit.\r"

The rims, caps, and ventricular size were rated on a scale from 0 to 3 for severity, and the UBOs were counted. The results indicated that the rim is also frequent in control subjects and increases with age. Unidentified bright objects, caps, and severe rims usually signify pathology, occurring much more frequently in patients with strokes and hemorrhages than in control subjects. Hypertension is a significant risk factor in UBOs and caps, but in rims, the incidence of diabetes is higher. The clinical and pathologic significance of these hyperintensities and their relationship to Binswanger's disease, lacunar state, and \"etat crible\" is discussed.\r"

Midventricular, high ventricular, and supraventricular CT slices were analyzed for each individual. Computerized techniques calculated the percent of fluid volume and the mean CT density for each slice. The mean CT density of a standard tissue sample was also evaluated. The results suggest that fluid volume at the level of the ventricles is fairly stable until individuals are in their 60s, when a dramatic increase occurs. The percent of fluid volume above the level of the ventricles appears to increase slightly the ventricles appears to increase slightly in the 50s and then level off. Whole slice mean CT density numbers decreased in a linear fashion with increasing age, but the mean CT density of a standard tissue sample did not. A discriminant function derived from the CT measures was significantly correlated with a discriminant function derived from the neuropsychologic test battery. Findings based on subjects whose health status has been less carefully screened may differ from those in the present study.\r"

Within both minor-to-moderate and severe injury classifications, patients with VFDs were more impaired neuropsychologically and had more frequent acute secondary intracranial complications (brain swelling, intracranial hypertension, and cerebral hyperemia) than patients without VFDs.

In parkinsonian patients, the overall incidence of the reflex was 71.5%, without clear effect of age. A positive correlation was found between degree of akinesia and incidence as well as intensity of the reflex. In the dyskinetic patients, the reflex was seldom elicited, and, if so, it was small. Modifications of the characteristics of the response could be disclosed in parallel with variations of the patient's clinical status. These findings suggest that the presence of a palmomental reflex in parkinsonian patients could indirectly reflect the decrease of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathways.\r"

Patients with signs lateralized to the right were more impaired on tests of dominant hemisphere function (serial digit learning, confrontation naming, and verbal associative fluency), but no differences were found on tests of nondominant hemisphere function (form sequence learning, line orientation, facial recognition), indicating some correlation of neuropsychological performance with lateralization of predominant motor signs.

The spells became more severe and progressed to loss of awareness associated with clonic jerks of the extremities. Because of a concern that the spells represented seizures, an EEG was performed, with electrocardiographic monitoring. Multiple spells were recorded; they began with profound bradycardia followed by generalized slow-wave activity and then by suppression of all EEG activity correlating with loss of consciousness and clonic jerking.

  ".W": "Anterior chamber fluorophotometry was performed after the oral administration of fluorescein sodium in patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion before and after surgery. The administration of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine solution (ketorolac solution) eye drops before and after surgery decreased the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier as compared with 0.1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution (dexamethasone solution) eye drops at each period, as measured by fluorophotometry. A single injection below Tenon's capsule of a short-acting corticosteroid had been given to each patient at the end of each surgical procedure. Slit-lamp observations of postoperative ocular inflammation were not different between treatment groups. Both ketorolac and dexamethasone solutions were well tolerated by patients. Ketorolac solution was more effective than dexamethasone solution in facilitating reestablishment of the blood-aqueous barrier after surgery, as measured by fluorophotometry, and was equal to dexamethasone solution as observed by slit-lamp observations. This study suggests that ketorolac ophthalmic solution may be effective and safe as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for topical use after cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation in place of topically administered corticosteroids.\r"

Eyes that had reoperations averaged 2.2 diopters more initial myopia than eyes that did not have reoperations, and they averaged 43% myopia correction in the first surgery vs 84% for eyes that did not require reoperations; the reoperation corrected an additional 47% of residual myopia, for an overall 70% correction of myopia in the two surgeries. These results indicated that twice the desired effect of correction should be attempted in a reoperation to achieve the desired result.\r"

Most individuals with microcornea had a corneal diameter of less than 11 mm in both meridians, with moderately steep corneal curvatures. The inherited cataract progressed to form a total cataract after visual maturity had been achieved. In the four affected children who had not undergone cataract extraction, the common abnormality was a posterior polar lens opacity. The variability of expressivity of the dominant gene would suggest that the embryological origins of microcornea and sclerocornea are similar.\r"

Autoradiographic assessment of tritiated thymidine incorporation into trabecular cell DNA in a human corneoscleral explant organ culture system demonstrated a basal level of DNA replication that increased by 180% in the two days immediately after ALT. When labeling was initiated five days after ALT, DNA replication declined to 70% of the control level. The autoradiographic findings were confirmed using biochemical evaluation of tritiated thymidine incorporation into acid-precipitable macromolecules (DNA) in excised trabecular meshwork. One biologic response of the trabecular meshwork after laser trabeculoplasty is a change in the level of ongoing trabecular cell division.\r"

Unlike the procedure for total reconstruction of the socket that uses a custom-designed conformer wrapped with a full-thickness mucous membrane graft, reconstruction of a partially contracted socket uses a 0.5-mm-thick mucous membrane graft sutured to the resected socket conjunctiva and splinted in place by a custom-designed conformer. Seventeen patients with a variety of underlying pathologic conditions associated with trauma and prior surgery underwent successful ocular fornix reconstruction using this technique.\r"

We undertook a comparative study of 10,134 cases of human exposure to adult formulations of aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen from which we found that human exposures to analgesics are a common problem reported to poison control centers. All three analgesics studied appear to have minimal toxicity in children who accidentally ingest the product and report the exposure to a poison control center. Most children were managed without referral to a health care facility and without specific therapeutic intervention, other than palliative measures; only a few children develop symptoms from the exposure. When symptoms developed, most were not life-threatening and the child returned to a preexposure state of health within a short time after the onset of symptoms. In adults, the analgesics appear to be relatively safe--that is, most cases had either no effect or caused only minor symptoms; less than 5% of the patients developed a major effect and less than 0.5% died as a result of their exposure. Because the majority of adults took the analgesic intentionally, the low rate of serious effect is notable. Fewer adult patients who ingested ibuprofen were hospitalized or experienced a major effect as a result of their exposure than patients ingesting aspirin or acetaminophen. No deaths were reported in the ibuprofen group.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy exists concerning the appropriate loading dose of phenytoin in chronic alcoholic patients. Chronic alcoholics are frequently assumed to have low albumin levels secondary to malnutrition and liver disease. Phenytoin is bound to albumin, and therefore the usual loading dose of phenytoin might result in a higher percentage of unbound drug and increased toxicity in these patients. Thirty-six chronic alcoholic patients were given a 15-mg/kg loading dose of phenytoin by constant intravenous infusion. After the infusion, patients were evaluated for clinical signs of phenytoin toxicity. At 1 hour after infusion, blood was sent for determination of total phenytoin, free phenytoin, and albumin levels. Fifteen patients were hypoalbuminemic (mean, 3.4 g/dL); 21 patients had albumin levels within the normal range (mean, 4.3 g/dL). In the hypoalbuminemic group, the mean free phenytoin level was 1.1 micrograms/mL, and the mean total phenytoin level was 13.6 micrograms/mL. In patients with normal albumin levels, the mean free phenytoin level was 1.3 micrograms/mL, and the mean total phenytoin level was 15.7 micrograms/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in total phenytoin or free phenytoin levels between either groups. No patient had a postinfusion phenytoin level (either free or total) within the toxic range. Although our sample size was small, our results suggest that a 15-mg/kg loading dose of phenytoin does not produce toxic levels in chronic alcoholics.\r"

  ".W": "Nerve conduction studies of the anterior interosseous nerve were performed on 26 healthy subjects (6 women and 20 men, aged 24 to 63 years). The compound muscle action potential from the pronator quadratus muscle was obtained by using surface electrodes placed over the dorsal aspect of the distal forearm and median nerve stimulation at the elbow. The latency of the evoked potential was determined over distances that ranged from 17.5-28 cm from the elbow to the pronator quadratus muscle; this resulted in latencies of 3.5 ms (+/- 0.4) and 3.6 ms (+/- 0.4) for the left and right extremities, respectively, with a side-to-side difference of 0.1 ms (+/- 0.1). The amplitude of the potentials recorded was 3.1 mV (+/- 0.8); a difference in amplitude of 11.4% (+/- 7.7%) between extremities was seen. Although duration measurements were obtained, the frequent presence of biomodal peaks made interpretation difficult. This bimodal pattern was felt to represent either two heads of the pronator quadratus or another muscle innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve. The technique in the present study is easy to perform, allows better assessment of the compound muscle action potentials obtained and provides for side-to-side comparisons of latency and amplitude. This technique aids the electromyographer in evaluation of suspected cases of injury to the anterior interosseous nerve, particularly in unilateral cases.\r"

  ".W": "A thorough comprehension of electrodiagnostic equipment is essential to consistently obtain accurate and reproducible data. Unreliable waveform latencies or morphologies may result from inappropriate filter settings, sensitivity comparisons, sweep speeds, interelectrode separation, cathode/anode reversals and stimulus artifact. A low frequency filter with too high a frequency limit may decrease amplitude, shorten peak latency, decrease the negative spike duration, add a phase and increase total waveform duration. A high frequency filter with too low a cut-off may decrease amplitude and prolong onset and peak latencies. Increasing the amplifier's sensitivity may shorten the onset latency of a response. Sweep speeds that are too slow may omit phases, turns or entire potentials when using digital equipment. If the interelectrode separation is inadequate, waveform morphology and amplitude can be altered. Reversing cathode and anode placement affects latency and velocity determinations. Stimulus artifact may obscure a response and its reduction must be understood. Comparing latencies and amplitudes at different instrument settings is never appropriate and can lead to serious errors and misdiagnoses. A naive approach to instrumentation, therefore, is indefensible.\r"

Less than 48 hours after the procedure, a compartment syndrome developed in the volar forearm. Compartment syndrome has not previously been reported as a complication resulting from a nerve block procedure. We conclude that (1) compartment syndrome may develop after a peripheral nerve block procedure for spasticity, (2) prophylactic anticoagulation may increase the risk for hemorrhagic events resulting from percutaneous injection and (3) early recognition is essential and appropriate decompressive fasciotomy may be indicated if a compartment syndrome develops after a nerve block procedure.\r"

Allergic patients were subjected to intranasal and PBL challenge with D pteronyssinus and a nonrelevant allergen, Artemisia vulgaris. In all allergic patients, intranasal challenge by D pteronyssinus, but not by A vulgaris, resulted in a release of substances from the nasal mucosa that reacted in a radioimmunoassay with antiserum to LTC4. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus challenge in vitro of PBLs from the same patients, but not A vulgaris challenge, induced release of the same immunoreactive material into the supernatant. By comparison, the nonallergic subjects challenged with D pteronyssinus showed significantly lower LTC4 levels in their nasal secretions and PBL supernatants. The results show that, following specific allergen challenge, the release of LTC4 by the allergic nasal mucosa is similar in extent and nature to that of PBLs, indicating that these procedures can be used as tools to measure the efficacy of topically and systemically administered antiallergic drugs.\r"

A right vestibular neurectomy was performed in three young adult cats followed up three days later by the placement of horseradish peroxidase into the left vestibule. Labeled contralateral (right) VE neurons were examined in a transmission electron microscope for degenerating synaptic profiles contacting the soma. Ultrastructural characteristics of VE neurons, including nuclear size, volume fraction of intracellular organelles, number of synaptic profiles, and cellular shape, were quantitatively analyzed. No degenerating synaptic profiles were observed on labeled VE soma, although degenerating axons were present nearby. Statistical analysis of volume fraction data of the VE neurons suggests a continuum of a single subpopulation of cells rather than multiple subpopulations.\r"

These two major components of the lateral orbital wall may be impacted separately or as a unit into the posterior orbit to cause severe injuries to the eyeball or optic nerve. These ophthalmic injuries may be worsened by attempts to manipulate the bony fragments through the standard periorbital incisions. A safer approach is the temporal approach that exposes the entire lateral zygomatico-orbital region through a hemicoronal incision. This allows for manipulation of the lateral wall fragments under direct visualization and without retraction pressure on the globe. This larger operation appears justified in selected cases by the reduced risks to an already compromised eyeball or optic nerve.\r"

Four were excluded because of poor quality echocardiograms. The mean (range) age of the remaining 30 (12 women, 18 men) was 21 years (13-36 years). Cardiac output was calculated by six methods as a product of echocardiographically determined cross sectional area of the aorta (apical and suprasternal views), pulmonary trunk, tricuspid annulus, and mitral annulus (circular and corrected for diastolic variations), and the flow velocity integral measured by Doppler. Cardiac output ranged from 2.79 to 6.56 1/min (4.45 (1.29) 1/min) (mean (SD)). The feasibility of the methods ranged from 87% (26 patients) for the aorta from the suprasternal notch to 100% (30 patients) for the mitral orifice corrected for diastolic variations and for the tricuspid valve. The corresponding results for all 34 individuals were 76% and 88% respectively. Three way analysis of variance was performed in the 23 healthy volunteers in whom all six methods were feasible. Interobserver and intraobserver interpretative variabilities were 6.8% and 5.9% respectively. The intrinsic variability of each single measurement of cardiac output, independently of the observer and the method used, was 25%. Provided the image was suitable for analysis echocardiographic and Doppler flow determination of cardiac output was feasible in most healthy volunteers. But there was significant intrinsic variability for each of different methods. A single value of cardiac output in an individual should be interpreted with caution.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular cineangiograms (30 degrees right anterior oblique projection) and high fidelity left ventricular pressure were recorded at rest in 10 individuals with normal hearts and at rest and during an episode of angina provoked by rapid atrial pacing in 14 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Angiograms were digitised frame by frame. The ventricular perimeter was divided into 40 segments and regional ventricular function was examined by means of isometric and contour plots and by the construction of segmental pressure-wall displacement loops. In 10 patients 12 abnormal resting regions were identified. The commonest (11 regions) was delayed onset of inward endocardial motion during systole which was manifest by diagonal contour lines on the contour plot. Six regions (five with associated delay in onset of inward motion) showed resting hypokinesis. Angina was associated with the development of 19 new regions of abnormal wall motion in 12 patients. Fourteen of these regions of abnormality were thought to be primary events occurring as a consequence of ischaemia and five to be secondary events occurring in normally perfused regions of myocardium. Hypokinesis occurred in 12 regions, developing in a region with normal amplitude at rest in seven and as an extension of resting hypokinesis in five. In 10 out of 12 cases the region of hypokinesis developed in a region showing diagonal contour lines at rest. Asynchrony with delay in the timing of peak inward displacement relative to minimum volume occurred with angina in eight regions (in six cases concomitant with hypokinesis and in two cases in isolation). In contrast with hypokinesis the pattern of wall motion at rest did not permit regions developing asynchrony with angina to be identified. Pressure-displacement loops show that regional hypokinesis is associated with reduced segmental work and that regional asynchrony (delayed or premature timing of peak inward endocardial displacement) is associated with a loss of efficiency of energy transfer between the myocardium and the circulation. These observations illustrate the complex nature of wall motion abnormalities occurring with angina.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between dyspnoea of presumed cardiac origin and disturbed left ventricular systolic function was studied in a group of 67 year old men from the general population of Gothenburg, Sweden. Forty two men with cardiac dyspnoea were identified and 45 controls were randomly selected from a screened cohort of 644 men. Dyspnoea was graded according to the World Health Organisation standard, and M mode echocardiography, carotid pulse tracing, an apex cardiogram, and phonocardiography were used to evaluate the grade of dyspnoea and its relation to systolic time intervals, left ventricular ejection indices, and wall stress. The dyspnoea grade was significantly related to the left ventricular end systolic dimension, to septal and posterior wall fractional thickening, and to ejection indices such as fractional shortening. The dyspnoea grade was also significantly correlated with the ratio of end systolic wall stress to end systolic volume index. There was a close relation between end systolic wall stress and mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening adjusted for heart rate. This relation did not clearly show reduced inotropy in the dyspnoeic men. There was no relation between the degree of dyspnoea and the systolic time intervals. Among the systolic variables obtained by echocardiography the only abnormal finding in mild to moderate dyspnoea was an increased end systolic dimension. The grade of cardiac dyspnoea seemed to be related to the degree of systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which was considerably impaired in severe dyspnoea. In population studies left ventricular end systolic dimension and fractional shortening may provide sufficient information on systolic function without the need to assess variables that are independent of load.\r"

Forty two men with cardiac dyspnoea and 45 controls were selected from the screened cohort of 644 men. M mode echocardiography, apexcardiography, and phonocardiography were used to evaluate heart sounds, diastolic time intervals, aortic root motion (atrial emptying index); peak rate of change in left ventricular dimension, left atrial and ventricular size; and left ventricular mass. There was a significant relation between dyspnoea grade and left ventricular mass and posterior wall thickness. Dyspnoea grade also correlated significantly with the amplitude of the rapid filling wave and the third heart sound, atrial emptying index and left atrial size, the pulmonary component of the second heart sound, and the dimension of the right ventricle. In mild to moderate dyspnoea fractional shortening was normal, but posterior wall thickness and left atrial dimension were increased. The time from the second heart sound to the O point of the apexcardiogram, adjusted for heart rate, was significantly prolonged in mild to moderate dyspnoea, but not in severe dyspnoea. There was a significant decrease of rate adjusted isovolumic relaxation time, probably secondary to altered loading conditions, in severe dyspnoea, but not in mild to moderate dyspnoea. When the effect of systolic function was excluded multivariate analyses showed that the relation between dyspnoea grade and left atrial dimension persisted. The finding that diastolic abnormalities of the heart contributed to the generation of cardiac dyspnoea may have implications for treatment.\r"

The accurate description of the anatomy of individual defects, from cross sectional images, is more important than attempts to fit them into a preconceived classification. One hundred specimens of hearts with a ventricular septal defect were reviewed to identify those features that are of value in the interpretation of cross sectional images. Three groups of defect were identified: those which abutted the central fibrous body, those with a margin partly formed by an area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves, and those with entirely muscular margins. Each group had features that were readily discernible in cross section. Other features of the defects seen in the cross sectional images identified defects that opened between the two ventricular inlets, defects that opened between the two subarterial outlets, and those that extended solely into the trabecular septum. The criteria for describing the anatomy of defects were established in hearts with normal connections, but they were found to be equally applicable in hearts with discordant atrioventricular connection, discordant ventriculoarterial connection, common arterial trunk, and double outlet from the morphologically right ventricle. Cross sectional imaging, by echocardiography and potentially by other techniques, provided a uniquely detailed and precise description of the morphology of ventricular septal defects.\r"

In 18 of these cases the diagnosis of coarctation or interruption of the aorta was correctly inferred from these findings. On direct echocardiographic examination of the aortic arch, arch hypoplasia or interruption of the aortic arch was recognisable prenatally in 10 of these 18 cases, most readily between 20-30 weeks' gestation. In 11 of 12 cases of aortic arch anomaly studied by Doppler echocardiography, a reduction in blood flow in the ascending aorta was demonstrated. The intracardiac appearances were suggestive of coarctation but the Doppler findings were within normal limits in two further cases which later proved to be normal. A diaphragmatic hernia was found in four fetuses and the intracardiac echocardiography and Doppler findings were the same as those found in fetuses with aortic coarctation. Five cases of coarctation were overlooked on the prenatal echocardiogram but these were found at follow up of the infants. Thus coarctation of the aorta can be diagnosed prenatally, although the condition may be missed or incorrectly predicted by the criteria examined in the present study. Reduced aortic blood flow is a demonstrable feature of aortic arch abnormalities but it is found in other conditions that are not associated with coarctation.\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of patients were allowed to self-administer morphine (n = 17) or pethidine (n = 15) extradurally after abdominal surgery, for a mean period of 16 h. Bolus increments of morphine 1 mg or pethidine 20 mg were administered by programmable pump. Pain relief from extradural patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was excellent in all but two patients in the morphine group. Pain relief was not qualitatively different between the two groups. No clinical respiratory depression was seen. The average consumption of extradural morphine was 0.52 +/- 0.29 mg h-1 (range 0.19-1.04 mg h-1) and of pethidine 18.0 +/- 8.1 mg h-1 (5.8-35.4 mg h-1). This yields an equianalgesic dose relationship of 1:35. Morphine consumption was more irregular than pethidine consumption. Morphine and pethidine plasma concentrations measured during PCA were well below the reported minimum analgesic plasma concentrations in most cases. Several patients, particularly in the pethidine group, tended to increase their opioid consumption during PCA. This could be explained by an increasingly smaller fraction of the pethidine bolus being absorbed to the subarachnoid space during frequent repetitive dosing. The large inter-individual variation in consumption makes it impossible to recommend a standard dose of extradural morphine or pethidine for analgesia of predictable duration and with a minimum of adverse effects.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown a dose-related effect of a number of general anaesthetic agents on the early cortical waves in the auditory evoked response (AER). In this study the effect of surgical stimulation on these waves was examined in 11 patients anaesthetized with thiopentone, nitrous oxide and halothane and paralysed with pancuronium. The inspired nitrous oxide concentration and end-tidal halothane concentration were held constant at 70% and 0.3%, respectively, and baseline AER recordings were made. Following surgical stimulation there was a progressive and significant increase in the amplitude of waves Nb and Pb/Pc. Unambiguous autonomic responses were seen in three patients, but these were not significantly correlated with changes in the AER. We conclude from this, and previous studies, that the amplitude of cortical waves in the AER are sensitive not only to anaesthetic concentration but also to surgical stimulation. The AER may, therefore, provide a useful index of depth of anaesthesia, that is the balance between the effects of surgical stimulation and anaesthetic depression on central nervous system activity.\r"

  ".W": "In two groups of dogs, the uptake and elimination of halothane and isoflurane were studied using a closed-loop anaesthetic system which automatically controlled end-tidal halothane and isoflurane partial pressures at equi-MAC concentrations. Haemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded and the anaesthetic partial pressures were measured in the inspired and expired air, as well as in the arterial, cerebrovenous and mixed venous blood. The controller delivered a higher inspired partial pressure of halothane than of isoflurane to compensate for the higher blood/gas partition coefficient. The partial pressures of halothane in the arterial, cerebrovenous and mixed venous blood increased at rates similar to those of isoflurane. During 160 min of uptake, the cerebral venous partial pressures remained significantly lower than the arterial partial pressures for both agents. On discontinuation of the anaesthetic, the partial pressures of halothane and isoflurane decreased at equal rates in arterial, cerebrovenous and mixed venous blood, and in end-tidal gas. It was concluded that the rate of uptake of isoflurane is more rapid than that of halothane from the alveolar space to the blood, but not from the blood to brain tissue. The rates of elimination from brain tissue and from blood were found to be similar for both agents.\r"

As myocardial regional dysfunction is a sensitive index of subendocardial ischaemia, the relationship between EVR and regional function has been studied in an experimental model of coronary artery constriction. In 13 dogs anaesthetized with halothane (0.5-2.0% inspired concentration), diastolic and systolic pressure time indices were obtained by planimetry, and their ratio (EVR) correlated with regional function. Halothane alone caused a significant reduction in EVR from 1.38 +/- 0.08 to 1.15 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SEM). In the presence of coronary artery constriction a similar decrease in EVR was observed and was accompanied by post-systolic shortening (PSS), an indicator of regional dysfunction. At high concentrations of halothane, there was an inverse correlation between reduction in EVR and increase in PSS. Mean EVR of approximately 0.9 (mean = 0.92 +/- 0.02) was associated with significant worsening of regional function.\r"

We measured fo and beta for two pressure transducers (Gould P23 Statham and Gould Disposable) in combination with Portex or Gould catheter tubing of lengths varying from 100 cm to 300 cm. All combinations were considerably underdamped, with the best having an fo of 30 Hz and a beta of 0.1. We also investigated the performance of a commercial device, the Accudynamic, designed to allow beta to be increased without affecting fo. We found that the Accudynamic worked well, allowing acceptable performance to be obtained from the Gould Disposable transducer with catheters up to 200 cm in length.\r"

Rapid onset of sedation was seen after sublingual lormetazepam, while the course and duration of postoperative sedation, measured using standard psychometric tests, was similar following both treatments. Surgeons' ratings indicated that sublingual lormetazepam was comparable to i.v. diazepam but patients' ratings indicated greater satisfaction with and preference for i.v. diazepam. Significant anterograde amnesia was found following both treatments. Both treatments were tolerated well, with no significant cardiovascular complications. These results indicate that sublingual lormetazepam may have a role in anaesthesia as a premedicant and for conscious sedation.\r"

Arterial blood-gas tensions were measured before and after 5, 10, 20 and 30 min of oxygen administration and 15 min after return to breathing room air. Oxygen administration produced an immediate, significant and persistent decrease in ventilation, principally from a decrease in ventilatory rate and changes in ventilatory times. This was in contrast to what occurred in awake animals. Modifications in ventilatory mechanics or suppression of an hypoxic stimulus to ventilation were probably not involved.

IgA class thyroid antibodies were found in 29% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients. Overt thyroid disease had been diagnosed in six (5%) of the dermatitis herpetiformis group and a further six patients had elevated TSH levels. The presence of thyroid antibodies was not associated with particular HLA-DR antigens. These results demonstrate the frequent occurrence of thyroid antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis, although thyroid failure is less commonly associated with this condition. Immune response genes outside the HLA-DR region may be involved in the immune hyper-responsiveness seen in dermatitis herpetiformis which is reflected in the high prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity.\r"

The whole follicle was found to be significantly increased in volume compared with follicular structures in the control specimens. The size of differentiated sebaceous gland cells was found to be reduced compared with controls (490 +/- 72 microns 2 and 554 +/- 98 microns 2, respectively), but not significantly so. The mean tritiated thymidine autoradiographic labelling index determined in vitro was found to be decreased (5.42 +/- 1.79) compared with controls (7.48 +/- 2.44), but again, not significantly so. In addition the degree of solar elastotic degenerative change was found to be similar in SGH bearing skin compared with control samples. It is of interest that SGH and prostatic hypertrophy are exceptions to the usual atrophy of ageing and that both tissues are androgen dependent.\r"

All non-responding acne patients attending the Leeds General Infirmary between September 1985 and April 1986 (49 out of a total of 610 patients; 8%) were investigated with respect to changes in their acne grade, microbial flora and sebum excretion rate. They were compared with 22 age and sex matched untreated control subjects. It was found that in 65% of non-responding patients there was no microbiological abnormality, in 16% there was evidence of Gram-negative folliculitis and 20% carried predominantly antibiotic resistant propionibacteria compared with only 5% of untreated controls. There was a significant association between erythromycin therapy and the isolation of erythromycin resistant propionibacteria (P less than 0.001). A causal link, however, has yet to be established between carriage of antibiotic resistant propionibacteria and failure to respond to antibiotic therapy. Our results show that for most patients with recalcitrant acne a non-microbiological explanation must be sought for the lack of therapeutic success. The mean sebum excretion rate (SER) of the non-responding patients was significantly higher than that of matched untreated acne patients (P less than 0.001). A majority of non-responders (69%) had an SER above the upper 95% confidence limit of the control mean. The SER may affect treatment efficacy by influencing the antibiotic concentration within the pilosebaceous ducts.\r"

Of the dyslexic children 64% were unable to make proper vergence movements when macular sized fusion targets (2 1/2 degrees) were employed, but their vergence control was better for larger (7 degrees) targets. The normal readers and the remaining dyslexics showed normal vergence responses for both large and small moving fusion stimuli. The results suggest that many dyslexics suffer a disorder of visuomotor control and perception for stimuli falling on the macula; this may explain their characteristic visual problems when reading. Hence recording vergence eye movement responses to small moving fusion stimuli may be useful in the investigation and treatment of children with reading difficulties.\r"

  ".W": "We report on spectrin Oran (alpha II/21), a new spectrin variant found in an Algerian family. It was characterized by the absence of the spots that classically correspond to the alpha II domain using two-dimensional analysis of spectrin limit digests. On the contrary, the abnormal domain was represented by a new set of spots in the 21-Kd and 16-Kd regions, as demonstrated by Western blots using anti-alpha II domain polyclonal antibodies. Spectrin Oran (alpha II/21) was found in the homozygous state in two children belonging to two separate branches of the family. It yields a severe elliptocytosis. Spectrin self-association was altered. The variant was much more difficult to prove in the heterozygous state, in which it results in no clinical and virtually no morphological symptom. In all four parents involved, however, electrophoretic analysis and Western blots showed the existence of the alpha II 21-Kd and 16-Kd peptides. In one parent, who combines spectrin Oran (alpha II/21) and the alpha II type-2 polymorphism, the two-dimensional spots (52, 39, 34, and 29 Kd) were quantified and appeared reduced by 30%: there was an intermediary decrease of spectrin self-association in this person. In the three other parents, spectrin Oran combined with the alpha II type-1 polymorphism. The alpha II type-1 spots (46, 35, 30, and 25 Kd) appeared in normal range, and spectrin self-association was normal. Along with previous observations, the present data emphasize the large fluctuations of the alpha-variant percentage. Provided spectrin Oran was present in a sufficient proportion, we found an associated alteration of the beta II domain (that faces the alpha II domain in the spectrin dimer): the beta II 65-Kd fragment was reduced and the beta II 52-Kd fragment was reciprocally increased.\r"

BE reacted with PLA1 positive but not with PLA1 negative platelets. DEK-1 reacted strongly with PLA1 positive platelets but weakly with PLA1 negative platelets. The remaining three MoAbs reacted equally with PLA1 positive as well as negative platelets. BE, DEK-1, DEK-10, and DEK-16 reacted with a 120,000- as well as 100,000-mol wt band on immunoblot of PLA1 positive platelets. The 120,000-mol wt band copurified with affinity purified 100,000-mol wt GPIIIa. Megakaryocytes had a prominent 120,000- as well as 105,000-mol wt band that reacted with BE on immunoblot (the 100,000-mol wt band was not detectable). Umbilical cord endothelial cells from presumed PLA-positive infants had a prominent 100,000-mol wt band that reacted with BE, DEK-16, and DEK-1 (the 120,000-mol wt band was not visualized). The 120,000- and 100,000-mol wt PLA1-positive bands could be digested with proteolytic enzymes to 55,000- to 65,000-mol wt-resistant fragments that retain PLA1 epitopes. Further digestion with endoglycosidase-H lowered the apparent mol wt by approximately 2,000 to 6,000 daltons without affecting PLA1 reactivity. We conclude that the PLA1 antigen is present on a 120,000- as well as 100,000-mol wt glycoprotein of platelets and megakaryocytes, a 105,000-mol wt band of megakaryocytes, and a 100,000-mol wt glycoprotein of endothelial cells. We postulate that the 120,000-mol wt glycoprotein, which shares three or more epitopes with the 100,000-mol wt GPIIIa, may be a post-translational precursor of this species.\r"

Before disappearance of the bleeding disorder, results of coagulation studies and platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, thrombin, A23187, epinephrine, and ristocetin were normal. In contrast, aggregation only occurred in the presence of collagen or wheat germ agglutinin at unusually high doses of these agonists. The platelets adhered normally to purified bovine and human type I collagen, and they did not spread in the presence of methylated type I collagen. No collagen-induced clot retraction was observed. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analyses of platelet proteins and immunologic studies showed that intact thrombospondin and GP Ia were absent. Aggregation in response to collagen could be restored by adding thrombospondin. Disappearance of the bleeding tendency occurred at the onset of menopause; subsequent analyses revealed that thrombospondin and GP Ia were present in platelets and that collagen-induced platelet aggregation was normal. These results suggest that both thrombospondin and GP Ia are essential in collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The spontaneous disappearance of the bleeding tendency may have been related to hormonal influences.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) the RBCs, neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes, and platelets derived from the abnormal clone are deficient in the complement-regulatory protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF). RBC acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activities are also characteristically low. DAF, AChE, and LAP are known to be anchored within cell membranes to glycophospholipid-containing phosphatidylinositol (PI). Because PNH progenitors contain DAF that appears to be lost with maturation, it has been proposed that this disorder results from abnormal tethering of these and possibly other proteins to membrane PI. We were puzzled, therefore, that our two PNH patients consistently had normal LAP levels. Consequently, we studied their isolated PMNs to compare DAF and LAP activities in individual cells. PMNs were separated by flow cytometry into DAF-positive and -negative populations by using rabbit anti-DAF antiserum and fluorescein-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG. In both patients the majority of PMNs were DAF deficient, and these cells contained very little alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, the smaller, DAF-positive cell populations were phosphatase replete. This is the first demonstration that abnormalities in DAF and LAP activity occur in the same PNH PMN population and strengthens the hypothesis that defective anchoring of proteins to membrane glycophospholipid underlies the pathophysiology of this disorder.\r"

In comparison to the number that bind to fibronectin-covered glass surfaces, less than 3% bind to thrombospondin-covered glass surfaces. When the fibronectin-covered surface is incubated with thrombospondin, it loses 87% of its binding capacity for platelets. The inhibitory effect of thrombospondin on platelet binding increases with increasing amounts of the adsorbed protein and reaches maximal values at 65% saturation of the adsorption of thrombospondin to the surface. Platelet spreading on the surface is also completely inhibited by thrombospondin. These data suggest that thrombospondin is nonthrombogenic and can modulate platelet adhesion to the subendothelium.\r"

  ".W": "During inflammation polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) are exposed to agonistic stimuli including activated complement, kallikrein, arachidonic acid metabolites, monokines, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). We report that PAF not only directly activates PMNs but in miniscule quantities (10(-12) mol/L) \"primes\" them as well, that is, permits PMNs to respond to subsequent stimuli that would be otherwise ineffectual. PAF priming of responses including superoxide generation, elastase release, and aggregation is time dependent and is maximal within five minutes. PAF need not be present during the subsequent exhibition of PMN agonists, but priming is inhibited by cold and is also inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonists BN 52021, L-652, and kadsurenone. An intact PAF molecule is required because lyso-PAF and methoxy-PAF do not prime PMN responses. PAF priming is associated with both enhanced expression of the adhesive glycoprotein identified by OKM-1 antibody and an enhanced rise in intracellular calcium levels in response to the subsequent addition of agonists such as FMLP. PMNs primed with PAF and stimulated with either F-Met-Leu-Phe or phorbol esters are more effective in lysing and detaching cultured human endothelial cells--damage that can also be inhibited by the PAF antagonists. Because PAF is synthesized and exhibited on surfaces of endothelial cells perturbed by coagulation, we suggest that this lipid may potentiate otherwise trivial activators of marginated PMNs so that they become damaging to the PAF-synthesizing endothelium itself. If so, our studies suggest a possible therapeutic role for PAF inhibitors in excessive inflammatory states.\r"

  ".W": "A variant of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), first described in a patient from Seattle, was studied by structural analysis of the gamma-globin genes. A family study suggested that the determinant for this form of HPFH, in which the HbF contains both G gamma- and A gamma-globin chains, segregated with the beta S gene. No deletions or other abnormalities were detected in the fetal to adult globin gene region by genomic mapping studies. All four gamma-globin genes were isolated from a cosmid library, and allelic pairs of gamma-globin genes were distinguished by linkage to either the beta S- or beta A-globin gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the four gamma-globin gene promoters revealed a total of three discrepancies compared with a reference sequence, but these were judged unlikely to be the underlying determinants. Sequence analysis of the enhancer region located 3' to the A gamma-globin gene from the putative HPFH chromosome revealed three base substitutions, whereas this region was normal in the A gamma-globin gene linked to the beta A gene. These data raise the possibility that an alteration of enhancer function rather than promoter function could be the basis for this condition.\r"

The mean iron content of ferritin protein in those and other subjects with plasma ferritin concentrations of over 1,000 was 6.8% +/- 2.7%. Plasma transferrin was usually saturated with iron in patients with measurable ferritin iron, but exceptions occurred. In studies using electrophoretic separation, it was shown that some ferritin iron moved to transferrin during in vitro incubation, whereas exchange in the opposite direction was extremely limited. Because some plasma ferritin iron was measured by the standard colorimetric plasma iron determination, these observations (a) indicate that plasma ferritin contains a significant amount of iron (b) indicate that a significant proportion of nontransferrin iron in individuals with nontransferrin iron as detected by standard plasma iron and total iron-binding capacity measurements is due to the presence of ferritin, and (c) suggest that large amounts of ferritin iron may affect the saturation of plasma transferrin.\r"

A consistent relationship within each group existed between the degree of erythropoiesis and radioiron absorption. Although the effect of erythropoiesis on iron absorption was of similar magnitude in the two thalassemia groups, the effect in hereditary spherocytosis was much less. There was agreement between absorption and ferritin or magnetic susceptibility (SQUID) measurements of iron stores in thalassemia, but in hereditary spherocytosis a discrepancy existed between absorption and ferritin. It is concluded that, although increased erythropoiesis is associated with increased iron absorption, some additional factor associated with red cell breakdown is more directly responsible for the positive iron balance in thalassemia.\r"

  ".W": "Human 253J urinary carcinoma cells and the F1 (low-metastatic) and F10 (high-metastatic) variants of the B16 murine melanoma cell line have been shown to activate heparinized human platelets by an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-dependent mechanism based on inhibition by creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase and the identification of aggregating concentrations (1 to 2 mumol/L) of ADP in cell-free culture supernatants by high-performance liquid chromatography. Aggregation did not occur in citrated samples, and hirudin was without effect. Studies were carried out to determine whether extracellular ADP arose from nonspecific cell damage during cell isolation and manipulation or was a specific process under control of the tumor cells themselves. Tumor cell damage during harvesting was shown not to be a factor because the amounts of ADP produced by the three cell lines (a) were inversely related to the appearance of lactic dehydrogenase in the culture supernatants and (b) were similar when measured in confluent monolayers, either in tumor cells after detachment and resuspension or after crossover studies involving culture in, alternatively, Hanks' balanced salt solution and minimal essential medium. Metabolic control of ADP production was indicated by the fact that (a) it was not dependent on cell number, which suggests feedback inhibition; (b) it was reduced 60% when tumor cells were treated with p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; and (c) it was completely abolished in those treated with iodoacetic acid, which might be expected to increase nonspecific leakage. These studies indicate that ADP production by these three lines does not arise due to leakage induced by nonspecific membrane damage during cell harvesting and manipulation but is a discrete process under metabolic control of the tumor cells. Moreover, in B16 murine melanoma cells the ability to produce ADP and to support platelet aggregation appears to be unrelated to metastatic potential insofar as identical results were obtained with the F1 and F10 variants.\r"

  ".W": "The association of fibrinogen with washed human platelets was examined by immunocytochemistry during aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and during deaggregation. The platelets were suspended either in a medium containing 2 mmol/L Ca2+ or in a medium containing no added Ca2+ (20 mumol/L Ca2+). Platelets were fixed at several times during aggregation and deaggregation, embedded in Lowicryl K4M, sectioned, incubated with goat antihuman fibrinogen, washed, reacted with gold-labeled antigoat IgG, and prepared for electron microscopy. To determine whether the method detected fibrinogen associated with the platelets, the platelets were pretreated with chymotrypsin (10 U/mL) and aggregated by fibrinogen; gold particles were apparent not only in the alpha granules but on the platelet surface and between adherent platelets as well. In the medium with 2 mmol/L Ca2+, ADP caused extensive aggregation of normal platelets in the presence of fibrinogen (0.4 mg/mL), and gold particles were evident between the adherent platelets and on the platelet surface; when the platelets deaggregated, gold was no longer present on the surface. In a medium without added Ca2+, ADP caused extensive aggregation in the presence of fibrinogen, and large numbers of gold particles were on the platelet surface and even more between adherent platelets. In this medium, the platelets did not deaggregate, and by five minutes, the granules appeared to be swollen or fused. In the absence of external fibrinogen, ADP caused the formation of small aggregates, and fibrinogen was not detected between adherent platelets. Thus, the association of fibrinogen with the platelet surface enhances platelet aggregation but is not essential for the ADP-induced formation of small aggregates. The association of fibrinogen with platelets is greater under conditions in which platelets release their granule contents and do not deaggregate because both endogenous and exogenous fibrinogen take part in aggregation.\r"

All the samples except two shortened the recalcification time of normal human plasma, the effect being significantly greater in the M3 subgroup.

None of the M5 samples fulfilled these criteria. In addition, M1, M2, M3, and M4 samples immunoreacted with an anti-CP goat polyclonal antibody on an Ouchterlony immunodiffusion plate.

Techniques previously used to measure membrane heme, however, would not distinguish between what is truly membrane-associated and what is merely trapped in RBC ghost preparations. Consequently, we have examined extensively washed inside-out membranes (IOM) prepared from normal and sickle RBC. Approximately 25% of the sickle ghost heme is lost upon conversion to IOM, but sickle IOM still have a significant excess (1.6 +/- 0.3 nmol heme/mg membrane protein compared with 0.7 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg for normal IOM, P less than .001). Amounts of ghost heme are only poorly predictive of amounts of IOM heme (r = .664). Preparation of IOM by using isotonic lysis with saponin yields virtually identical amounts of IOM heme. Small amounts of heme (less than 15%) can be displaced from IOM by using manipulations that elute spectrin, displace electrostatically bound proteins, or cleave the cytoplasmic portion of band 3. Treatment of IOM with dithiothreitol (DTT), however, displaces the most heme (35%), and this is almost reproduced (25% displacement) by the treatment of intact RBC with DTT before IOM preparation. Sequential treatment with all manipulations still leaves about 40% of the heme in sickle IOM, which indicates a compartment more intimately associated with the membrane. At least part of this is free heme without globin, as evidenced by abnormal binding of radiochloroquine to sickle IOM. Conversely, some IOM-associated globin is globin without heme because the measurement of globin per se markedly overpredicts amount of IOM heme. There is a strong correlation between RBC density and amounts of either ghost or IOM heme. Finally, the amount of membrane thiol oxidation (as measured by thiol-disulfide-exchange chromatography) does not correlate at all with ghost heme (r = .105), but it correlates well with IOM heme (r = .877, P less than .001). These data demonstrate that there are abnormal amounts of heme truly associated with sickle RBC membranes, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that this membrane-associated heme participates in the pathobiology of the sickle RBC membrane, particularly those aspects perhaps related to thiol oxidation.\r"

By using a serum, \"Har,\" obtained from a patient with posttransfusion purpura, we describe the platelet alloantigen Bakb. The Har serum reacted with an NP-40-extractable platelet membrane protein of 142 kd with mobility similar to platelet glycoprotein IIb alpha. We found that the antigen recognized by the Har serum is inherited in an autosomal dominant mode with an apparent gene frequency of .39. Chi-square analysis of observed and expected phenotype frequencies indicated that serum Har recognizes Bakb, the anticipated allele of Baka. Our findings provide new evidence for polymorphism of glycoprotein IIb and for the association of posttransfusion purpura with alloimmunization to determinants on this glycoprotein.\r"

The patient, a 21-year-old female, has a mild bleeding tendency; her platelets lack adenosine diphosphate (ADP) aggregation and have severely suppressed collagen aggregation but a normal response to ristocetin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of her platelets indicates that they contain two types of GPIIb molecules: one with an abnormal mol wt (122 kd, unreduced; 128 kd, reduced) and one with a normal mol wt (128 kd, unreduced; 118 kd, reduced). Relative to the amount of GPIIb in normal platelets, her platelets contain approximately 35% abnormal GPIIb and 20% normal GPIIb. Fibrinogen binding assays on the patient's platelets indicated that they contained 25% of the normal amount of fibrinogen receptors. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of the patient's platelets demonstrated the formation of a GPIIb/IIIa complex that was mainly composed of normal mol wt GPIIb and GPIIIa. The patient's father has decreased ADP aggregability, and his platelets also contained both abnormal and normal GPIIb (about 50% of the normal level and about 50% of the normal number of fibrinogen receptors); her mother has only normal GPIIb. These results indicate that the patient has heterozygous GPIIb molecules with an abnormality of GPIIb at the molecular level. Studies on this abnormal GPIIb should provide information about the function of GPIIb and the mechanism of its biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The transient detection of fibrinogen on surfaces has been described (Vroman effect) and high-mol-wt kininogen (HK) has been shown to play a role in this reaction. In this study, we attempted to identify the form of HK responsible for preventing detection of the fibrinogen initially adsorbed from plasma to various artificial surfaces and to determine if other plasma components were involved. We compared 125I-fibrinogen adsorption in the presence of normal plasma to plasma deficient in specific proteins. On all surfaces tested, we found that fibrinogen was displaced from the surface. The extent of displacement was greatly reduced, however, but not eliminated in HK-deficient plasma. Factor XII-deficient plasma also showed reduced fibrinogen displacement. These data indicate that HK can actually displace fibrinogen; however, factor XII, or a factor XII-mediated reaction also appears to be necessary for this displacement to occur. Furthermore, when normal plasma was first subjected to extensive contact activation by dextran sulfate, during which the HK was extensively degraded to components smaller than the light chain (as assessed by Western blotting), we observed greatly reduced displacement of fibrinogen. Extensive contact activation of Factor XI-deficient plasma failed to show low-mol-wt derivatives, however, and displacement of fibrinogen was similar to normal plasma that had not undergone extensive activation. These data indicate that HKa (active cofactor produced during contact activation by factor XIIa or kallikrein) is primarily responsible for displacing fibrinogen, and that HKi (inactive cofactor generated by factor XIa) cannot displace fibrinogen. The fibrinogen from all plasma samples looked similar by Western blot analysis, suggesting that fibrinogenolysis was not a component of the Vroman effect. In addition, experiments performed with plasma prechromatographed on lysine agarose showed that a lysine-agarose adsorbable protein may be minimally involved in fibrinogen desorption and a synergism may exist between HK and that protein.\r"

No colonies were observed in cultures without viral infection, whereas factor-independent colonies were consistently observed with virus-infected cultures. The number of colonies was linearly correlated with the number of cells plated. Erythroid-mix colonies consisting mostly of erythroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells could be observed. Tumorigenic, continuously growing mast cell lines could be generated at high frequency from these erythroid-mix colonies after they were initially passaged in the presence of an irradiated feeder layer for 4 to 8 weeks. Southern blot analysis of the DNA from five of these lines examined were all shown to contain integrated A-MuLV proviral DNA. These data are evidence that A-MuLV can directly infect embryonic multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and drive them to differentiate to various progeny cells without exogenous growth factors.\r"

Quantitative changes of the Gp Ib, IIb-IIIa, and/or their glucidic content have been reported. Since the Gp IIb-IIIa complex plays a major role in fibrinogen binding by activated platelets, we measured the platelet fibrinogen affinity in nine patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and one subject with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by the aggregometric method of Marguerie. In all patients the Kd of the platelet fibrinogen reaction was significantly decreased as compared to controls, with evidence in two cases with PV of a heterogeneity of platelet-fibrinogen receptor sites. The measurement of 125I-labeled fibrinogen-platelet binding, performed in seven patients (five PV and two CML), showed receptor populations with increased (Kd1 = 0.58 + 0.3 X 10(7) mol/L) and normal affinity (Kd2 = 5.12 + 3.1 X 10(7) mol/L). These results demonstrate a heterogeneity of platelet-fibrinogen receptors in these patients and may explain the thrombotic diathesis of MPD subjects.\r"

We characterized the mutations in 90% of the thalassemia chromosomes and found that three mutations, namely the beta+IVS 1-110, beta degrees -39 and beta+IVS 1-6 are prevalent in the Italian population. Most of the patients investigated were compound heterozygotes for two beta-thalassemia mutations, and only a few were homozygotes for one mutant. On the basis of these findings, we predict that prenatal diagnosis in this population would be feasible in most cases by fetal DNA analysis with the oligonucleotide method using a limited number of oligonucleotide probes selected after screening parents for the most common beta-thalassemia mutations. We have also devised a method based on hybridization with a mixture of two oligonucleotides that allows rapid and simultaneous screening of prospective parents for the two most frequent mutations in Italians, the beta+IVS 1-110 and beta degrees -39 mutants. This method may be applicable to prenatal diagnosis in cases at risk for the genetic compound of these mutations.\r"

The distribution of time in these three areas and the balance of exposure to inpatients and outpatients are discussed in detail. This program design ensures exposure to all the key elements of internal medicine in 3 years and should prevent significant gaps in knowledge at the time of certification. The implications for \"service\" in major teaching hospitals is discussed. Hospital departments and administrators must confront the prospect of hospital units without house staff.

Two patients with MG that was resistant to antimyasthenic drugs immediately responded to this combination. One patient with only MT had a complete response, and two patients with only MT had a partial response. Two out of the five patients are still alive and free of disease. Two patients died of disease, and one died from a neutropenia-induced respiratory tract infection. It is concluded that this combination chemotherapy is active in MT and MG and deserves additional trials.\r"

All received minimum total tumor doses of 80.00 Gy. After completion of treatment, all patients were followed with serial CT scans of the brain. Two to 6 months after treatment, 27 of 41 patients developed the similar thin-walled, regular, contrast-enhancing CT rings with low-density attenuation inside and outside the ring. Postmortem study in two of these patients revealed that the thin-walled, regular, contrast-enhancing ring represented a continuous capsule of dilated cerebral vessels with inner low-density attenuation corresponding to necrosis, and outer low-density attenuation corresponding to edema. The CT appearance of the thin-walled, regular, contrast-enhancing ring produced after high-dose rate intraoperative ECT and EXRT is distinctly different from the CT ring characteristic of untreated or recurrent GM. After high-dose rate intracranial ECT and EXRT, the appearance of a post-ECT contrast-enhancing CT ring should not be automatically interpreted as recurrent disease as previously reported after conventional fractionated EXRT.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen patients with malignant head and neck tumors were studied before they were treated with (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging and DNA flow cytometry (FCM). The nuclear DNA content and the percentage of proliferative cells (S + G2/M) were compared with the FDG uptake; FDG was retained in the primary tumor and/or neck metastasis in all patients. The accumulation of FDG did not correlate with histologic grade of the tumors, but there was a clear correlation (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001) between the proportion of the cells in S + G2/M phases of the cell cycle and the intensity of FDG accumulation. The uptake of FDG by the tumor also correlated with the percentage of S-phase cells (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001). The result suggests that enhanced glucose metabolism, measured by FDG uptake, is associated with the proliferative activity of the tumor. Thus, imaging with FDG may offer a new method to assess the aggressiveness of human cancer growth in vivo.\r"

There were no significant differences in the immunophenotypes of plasmacytomas and multiple myelomas. However, significant immunophenotypic differences were noticed between the plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma cases (PC/MM) and the immunoblastic lymphoma specimens. The PC/MM cases characteristically stained with alpha (or gamma) and T10 and did not usually stain with mu, leukocyte common antibodies, certain B-lineage antibodies (B1, T015, 4G7, 6A4), or Ia. In contrast, IL sections usually did not stain with alpha or T10 and generally did stain with mu (or gamma), leukocyte common antibodies, B-lineage antibodies, and Ia. Ki-67, an antibody to proliferating cells, stained significantly fewer cells in PC/MM than in IL and stained significantly fewer cells that had a good clinical outcome. We conclude that although no one antibody is useful in distinguishing PC/MM from IL, the application of a panel of antibodies may be helpful in making this distinction. The prognosis may correlate with the numbers of proliferating cells as measured by reactivity with Ki-67.\r"

These tumors were established as xenografts in athymic (nude) mice. Both xenografts maintained characteristic histologic features, immunocytochemical localization of basement membrane components, and reasonable yields of native laminin and Type IV collagen throughout three successive transplant generations. Although only a small fraction of the yield of that of the murine Engelbreth-Holm, Swarm (EHS) sarcoma, the yield of the human basement membrane-producing tumors could be increased by rendering the mice lathyritic. The human basement membrane proteins so extracted were identical on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to their murine counterparts. These human tumors then represent a potential source of human basement membrane proteins.\r"

Administration of oral indomethacin 50 mg daily was effective in decreasing the serum calcium concentration. However, this effect lasted only 5 days, after which it returned to pretreatment levels. The patient died in a hypercalcemic coma. By an autopsy, hepatocellular carcinoma was found in the right lobe of the liver. However, no obvious bone metastases nor abnormalities in the parathyroid glands were detected. The immunoreactive prostaglandin E level assayed in the neoplastic tissue (2278 ng/g) was significantly high when compared with level in the nonneoplastic liver tissue (194 ng/g). The production of prostaglandin E by the tumor itself appears to be the most likely mechanism for the hypercalcemia in this patient.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred four endocrine tumors found in the body and tail of the pancreas of a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN-I) were investigated by immunohistochemistry for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and gastrin. The results for each tumor were scored into six grades according to the frequency of immunoreactive cells. Pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin were demonstrated in 96, 80, 62, and 42 tumors, respectively. When only the higher scores of cell frequency (3-5) were considered, PP and glucagon (accounting for 71 and 49 tumors, respectively) differed markedly from insulin (two tumors) and somatostatin (0). The frequency of PP-immunoreactive cells was higher in tumors of large size whereas that of glucagon cells was higher in the smaller neoplasms. No significant associations of the tumoral hormonal expressions were found with the type of histologic structure (trabecular versus gyriform), the occurrence of stromal fibrosis, and the intrapancreatic location of the neoplasms, except for a higher number of somatostatin cells in fibrotic tumors. Gastrin-immunoreactive cells never were found in the tumors in spite of the concomitant hypergastrinemia. In conclusion, the nonrandom expression of the hormonal phenotype by the neoplastic islet cells, as shown by the immunohistochemical, semiquantitative analysis of a large number of tumors, suggests that in our MEN-I patient the genetically determined neoplasms also are affected by other mechanisms, possibly nongenetic.\r"

The aim of the study documented in this was to determine SADA variations in 27 patients suffering from malignant lymphomas (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's). Patients continued to be observed after therapy. The blood samples were collected before treatment (Time 0), during several days from the onset of each treatment (Phase I), and weeks after the last therapy (Phase II). A decrease in the serum alkaline DNase activity during the first treatment indicates a good clinical response; no decrease indicates a nonresponse to treatment (Phase I). The Phase II data can be used to predict the long-term evolution of the disease. In patients who respond to therapy three types of variations of SADA are observed during this phase. A progressive regain of SADA up to a value exceeding the level of initial value (T0) correlates with a complete remission. An incomplete regain of activity corresponds to a partial remission. No regain of SADA precedes death.\r"

It was found that the transferrin receptor is expressed by a wide variety of B- and T-lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The OKT9 staining also was loosely correlated with the three morphologic grades of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas identified by the International Working Formulation. In general, higher grade lymphomas more often and more intensely expressed the T9 antigen. However, transferrin receptor expression by certain histologic subtypes of lymphoma did not correlate with their morphologic grade: low-grade follicular lymphomas expressed the T9 antigen more frequently than diffuse low-grade lymphomas; diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas were stained by OKT9 less often than other histologic subtypes of intermediate-grade lymphomas; and diffuse immunoblastic lymphomas expressed transferrin receptors less often than the other high-grade histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas, not recognized in the International Working Formulation, were infrequently and weakly stained by OKT9 in a manner similar to diffuse low-grade lymphomas. We obtained clinical follow-up data on 43 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and 64 individuals with diffuse large cell and immunoblastic lymphoma. Transferrin receptor expression in these two groups did not correlate significantly with survival.\r"

By EM study too, many tumor cells showing features of oligodendroglial cells contained intermediate filaments. Our observations suggested the presence of a transitional form of cells in these tumors. The current study supports the contention that both oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas arise from a common progenitor cell capable of differentiation into both oligodendrocyte and astrocyte. The nature and degree of differentiation depends probably on gene expression and/or some microenvironmental factors.\r"

Of 60 patients, subclinical stage amounted to 35% (21/60), moderate stage 55% (33/60) and late stage 10% (6/60). There were 21 cases with small PLC (less than or equal to 5 cm). The postoperative course was uneventful in all of the 60 patients. These was no operative mortality, and there was no complications such as rupture of tumor, secondary bleeding, bile leakage, or abdominal infection. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year survival rates were 51.7% (30/58), 33.9% (19/56), 20.8% (11/53), 15.6% (7/45), and 11.4% (5/44), respectively, for the whole series. Among the 21 patients with tumor nodules less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter, the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year survival rates were 76.2% (16/21), 61.9% (13/21), 50.0% (9/18), 41.2% (7/17), and 37.5% (6/16), respectively. These results indicate that hepatic cryosurgery is a promising, safe, and simple treatment for neoplastic disease of liver. Cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen can be considered the surgery of choice for nonresectable PLC in patients without jaundice, ascites, and noncompensated liver function, and the whole tumor mass can be involved in the frozen area.\r"

Intrastage inhomogeniety was indicated by the finding that black patients had significantly more advanced T and N categories within stage grouping as compared to white patients (P = 0.013-P less than .001). A multivariate analysis controlling for age, T and N in nonmetastatic showed that when these factors were taken into consideration there was no significant independent effect of race on survival. The data indicate that the poorer prognosis which has been previously reported for black patients probably results from intrastage variability of disease bulk, supporting the use of the TNM rather that the stage grouping system for prognostication. Age differences also were evident when the two population groups were compared, with breast cancer in blacks appearing to present at an earlier age. Further analysis showed that these age differences were related to the age structure of the two populations and that breast cancer probably does not occur at a younger age in black subjects. Ethnic origin, does not appear to play a significant independent role in the prognosis of breast cancer in women.\r"

  ".W": "In 73 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III and IV ovarian cancer the prognostic significance of morphometric and flow-cytometric features has been evaluated in comparison with more commonly used prognostic factors such as stage and tumor mass. Single features associated with prognosis were as follows: FIGO stage, bulky disease, mean and standard deviation of nuclear area, cellular DNA content, mitotic activity index, and volume percentage epithelium. Multivariate analysis showed that the most significant prognostic combination of features consisted of mean nuclear area, presence or absence of bulky disease, and FIGO stage (in sequence of decreasing importance; Mantel-Cox = 23.07, P less than 0.00001). On the basis of these factors patients with a poor prognosis can be identified. On the other hand two features were associated with an excellent prognosis namely a low mitotic index and a low-volume percentage epithelium. It is concluded that morphometric and flow-cytometric analysis in combination with clinical features can provide significant information to predict the prognosis of patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. On the basis of our data a tentative proposal for future therapeutic approaches is made.\r"

After treatment, clinical and investigational evidence of objective regression of cerebral lesions was demonstrable in ten patients who survived with a median of 11.5 months from diagnosis of CNS involvement. In 11 additional patients, CNS disease remained clinically stable for a median period of 7 months. Median survival for the entire group of 100 patients was 2.5 months. However, eight patients (8%) survived longer than 1 year from the time of diagnosis of cerebral metastases, four of whom (4%) survived longer than 2 years; the longest survivor being disease-free and incomplete neurologic remission at more than 82 months. Patients with malignant melanoma metastatic to the brain should be informed of the therapeutic options available for their disease.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the efficacy and side-effects of continuous infusion versus repeated injections of epidural bupivacaine-fentanyl during labour. Forty-four parturients were randomly distributed into two groups balanced for population size, morphology and parity. Analgesia was begun at the same stage of labour with a mixture of 20 ml 0.25 per cent plain bupivacaine and 2 ml (100 micrograms) fentanyl. In Group I the initial dose ranged from 8-12 ml as a function of height; an injection of the same dose was repeated immediately upon recurrence of pain. In Group II, after an initial dose of 5-7 ml, a continuous infusion of 3 ml.h-1 was begun, and continued until full dilatation. Analgesia was rated using a pain scale; effects on maternal blood pressure, respiratory rate and neonatal status were noted. Bupivacaine and fentanyl assays were carried out on maternal venous blood in 30 parturients during the course of labour. There was a longer latency to onset of analgesia in Group II (approximately five minutes), followed by a more constant degree of analgesia. This better analgesia cannot be accounted for by a difference in dosage; doses were significantly lower in Group II, despite the fact that labour was of the same duration. The course of labour, and maternal and neonatal status were comparable in the two groups. Assays showed no difference in bupivacaine blood concentrations between the two groups nor signs of drug accumulation. The constant infusion technique is advantageous since it provides a more regular degree of analgesia with lower doses than those required for patients having repeated injections.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of meperidine in controlling shivering during epidural anaesthesia for Caesarean section, forty-six parturients were studied. After delivery of the infant, shivering patients received either a single dose of intravenous meperidine 50 mg, or saline in a randomized double-blind fashion. Shivering was classified on a scale of 0 to 3 (grade 0 = none, grade 3 = severe shivering that was distressing to the patient and interfered with monitoring). Shivering and other variables were recorded at epidural placement, skin incision, delivery, and 2, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes following injection. Administration of meperidine resulted in a significant decrease in both the overall incidence of shivering (87 to 35 per cent, p less than 0.01) and severity of shivering (grade 3:57 to 0 per cent, p less than 0.01), compared with saline (incidence: 87 to 83 per cent, grade 3:57 per cent, no change). This effect was apparent within two minutes of drug injection and persisted throughout the study period. There were no differences in vital signs, oxygen saturation or temperature between groups. The incidence of nausea was similar, although patients receiving meperidine were more drowsy at two and five minutes following injection (p less than 0.01) compared with patients in the saline group. There were no differences in level of consciousness at the later intervals. The mechanism of action of meperidine on shivering remains to be elucidated.\r"

Therefore to provide uninterrupted relaxation without overdosage it is advisable to regulate the IV infusion of vecuronium on the basis of appropriate monitoring. Monitoring with mechanomyography (MMG) or electromyography requires costly equipment and is too complex for routine clinical use. Visual observation of the adductor pollicis muscle contracting against zero resistance is not suitable for the reliable assessment of the degree of neuromuscular (NM) block. For clinical purposes satisfactory monitoring can be achieved with the simple device (Myoscan) described. The reliability of the Myoscan was tested in 30 patients by simultaneous monitoring of the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis on one side with the Myoscan and on the contralateral side with the MMG. Retrospective analysis of the MMG indicated that the conduct of anaesthesia would have been virtually the same if it would have been based on MMG monitoring.\r"

Neuromuscular function was recorded by a Datex Relaxograph. Recovery was assessed by the time the patients took to open their eyes, to be able to answer five questions correctly, the time to recovery of ocular balance (Maddox Wing test) and by comparing pre- and postoperative performance of a paper and pencil test (the p-deletion test). Recovery tests showed no significant differences between groups. After three hours all the patients were fit for discharge. The patients were interviewed one month after the procedure. All were satisfied with their anaesthetic. \"Full recovery\" took 1.5 days with a range of 1 h-7 days. The only significant difference (p less than 0.01) between the groups was the need for pharmacological reversal of residual paralysis. In a procedure with a mean duration of 45.6 minutes, and using isoflurane, all but one patient (95 per cent) in the atracurium group required neostigmine versus nine patients in the vecuronium group (45 per cent).\r"

  ".W": "Acetaminophen is frequently administered orally to children for its analgesic properties, although its potency has never been clearly evaluated in this population. In certain situations (patients vomiting or unconscious), acetaminophen has to be given rectally. However, the rectal absorption of suppositories is frequently erratic. We undertook this study first, to measure the absorption of an aqueous solution of acetaminophen administered rectally. Secondly, we evaluated acetaminophen's postoperative analgesic effects in children aged 1 to 8 years old undergoing adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy and compared its efficacy to meperidine. Twenty children received 20 mg.kg-1 of acetaminophen at the time of induction of anaesthesia while 20 others received 1 mg.kg-1 of meperidine intramuscularly. Thirty-two patients required meperidine in the Recovery Room. There was no statistical difference between the patients who received acetaminophen (18), and those who received meperidine (14). The absorption of acetaminophen was incomplete (peak serum concentration: 70.8 mumol.L-1) and delayed. We conclude that the rectal administration of acetaminophen at the induction of anesthesia results in incomplete and delayed absorption and does not prevent the occurrence of immediate postoperative pain in children undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy.\r"

The effects of 2.5 micrograms of either norepinephrine or epinephrine added to dibucaine on the duration of motor blockade and sensory regression time were compared. The duration of both were significantly prolonged by added norepinephrine from 96 +/- 17 min to 193 +/- 20 min (sensory blockade) and from 116 +/- 14 min to 204 +/- 34 min (motor blockade), but were not changed by addition of epinephrine.

In one of the operative deliveries, it proved impossible to achieve adequate blood levels of magnesium, due to severe pre-existing magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesaemia is likely to be present in such cases and must be corrected preoperatively. Magnesium sulphate is a useful adjunct to the anaesthetic management of the pregnant patient with a phaeochromocytoma provided that adequate serum levels of magnesium can be established.\r"

With the exception of a drop in blood pressure immediately after tumour removal, significant intraoperative haemodynamic stability was observed. There was no need for the intraoperative administration of hypotensive or anti-arrhythmic drugs, nor was any prolonged postoperative anaesthetic effect noted. In this case, the combination of midazolam and sufentanil with N2O:O2 was successful in maintaining cardiovascular stability until the tumour was removed. The consequent drop in blood pressure responded to fluid infusion, a not uncommon event in phaeochromocytoma surgery. Although a prospective randomized study for resection of phaeochromocytoma showed that the choice of the anaesthetic technique is not a crucial factor in determining the patient outcome, we feel this technique of midazolam sufentanil is a worthy alternative to the use of inhalational anaesthetics. The lack of significant myocardial depressive effect of the two drugs, coupled with its simple administration, makes it a useful technique in the anaesthetic management of phaeochromocytoma resection.\r"

The systemic availability of unbound prednisolone after oral prednisone and the apparent interconversion of prednisolone into prednisone and vice versa (reflecting the activity of the 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenase) were independent of age. The total exposure of the elderly subjects to prednisolone was increased because the nonrenal (5.7 +/- 1.0 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.6 ml/min/kg, mean +/- SD; P less than 0.001) and renal (0.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.001) clearances of unbound prednisolone were lower in the elderly. The fractional clearance of 6 beta-hydroxyprednisolone (reflecting the activity of the 6 beta-hydroxylase) decreased linearly with the metabolic clearance of prednisolone. Despite increased prednisolone exposure, elderly subjects had higher endogenous cortisol concentrations. It was concluded that elderly subjects exhibit higher concentrations of both total and unbound prednisolone. Despite this greater exposure of target tissues, there appears to be less suppression of endogenous cortisol concentrations in plasma compared with younger subjects.\r"

  ".W": "A design is described that uses need for supplemental (rescue) analgesic as a factor predicting effectiveness of a test analgesic. This methodology is especially suited for evaluating long-acting analgesics given repeatedly. Rescue use is measured over dosing intervals as test drug is titrated from a subanalgesic dose to that requiring no or minimal rescue. This design was used to evaluate oral long-acting morphine sulfate (MS Contin) given every 12 hours in a crossover study of cancer pain using oral immediate-release morphine sulfate given every 4 hours as reference. Less morphine was required for MS Contin given every 12 hours relative to immediate-release morphine sulfate given every 4 hours (186 +/- 22 mg vs. 239 +/- 35 mg; p = 0.04). Total daily morphine for both regimens correlated linearly (r = 0.96) with a slope of 1.27 +/- 0.11, significantly (p = 0.03) different from equivalence (slope of unity) in favor of MS Contin. This design features assay sensitivity (dose-response) and provides relative potency estimates for analgesics given at specific regimens.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of two widely used iron treatments on methyldopa absorption, metabolism, and blood pressure control. A 500 mg tablet of methyldopa (2.37 mmol) was taken with and without ferrous sulfate (325 mg) by 12 normal subjects in a randomized crossover trial. When ferrous sulfate was taken with methyldopa there was a decrease in the proportion of methyldopa excreted as \"free\" methyldopa (49.5% +/- 12.4% vs 21.1% +/- 4.77%; p less than 0.01), a significant increase in the proportion excreted as methyldopa sulfate (37.8% +/- 12.3% vs 65.8% +/- 10.5%; p less than 0.01), and a decrease in the percentage of methyldopa absorbed (29.1% +/- 12.5% vs 7.88% +/- 4.14%; p less than 0.01). These factors resulted in an 88% reduction in the quantity of \"free\" methyldopa excreted. To determine if an iron preparation without sulfate produced the same effect, the study was repeated with ferrous gluconate (600 mg) with similar results. The clinical consequences of the methyldopa-ferrous sulfate interaction was determined in five hypertensive subjects receiving chronic methyldopa therapy. The subjects took ferrous sulfate for 2 weeks. There was an increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in four patients and a decrease in blood pressure in all patients after ferrous sulfate was discontinued. The increases in blood pressure were substantial in three of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of dilevalol, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent with beta-agonism, on renal function were determined in two groups of patients. Patients in group 1, all with normal renal function, received either dilevalol or atenolol. Patients in group II, all with impaired renal function, received either dilevalol or metoprolol. Parameters of renal function determined before and after chronic oral treatment included glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow, and renal vascular resistance. Dilevalol lowered MAP by 14 mm Hg (P less than 0.005) in group I and 25 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) in group II but had no effect on other parameters of renal function, at either peak or trough drug levels. Atenolol and metoprolol also lowered MAP by 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) and 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.05), respectively. Atenolol reduced GFR by 23% at peak drug level, an effect that was partially ameliorated at trough drug level. The effect of atenolol on GFR appeared to vary as a function of baseline renal function in that greater reductions were seen in groups of patients with increasing baseline GFR. Metoprolol significantly decreased renal vascular resistance by 17% (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that dilevalol effectively lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with normal or compromised renal function with no negative impact on parameters of renal function.\r"

The disposition kinetics were described adequately by a three-compartment model. This study demonstrated that apart from a significantly longer lag time and smaller k10 (apparent first-order rate constant for elimination of meperidine from the central compartment), the addition of dextran did not alter significantly the kinetic parameters of epidural meperidine.\r"

In 230 sample pairs the plasma and saliva concentrations of metronidazole were identical (r = 0.99). In 119 subjects the one-sample clearance of metronidazole was unimodally distributed. Body weight (r = 0.28) and the alcohol consumption (r = 0.23) correlated with the metronidazole clearance.

These drugs have previously been found to influence a variety of psychologic and behavioral functions and have, in some cases, been associated with serious psychiatric side effects. The present study examined psychologic changes associated with beta-blockade therapy. Twenty-six men with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90 to 110 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive either a selective beta 1-antagonist (atenolol), a nonselective beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist (propranolol), or a placebo. Both before and after a 2-week period of drug administration, subjects completed a comprehensive assessment of quality of life including measures of mood, memory performance, and side effects. In general, beta-blocker therapy was associated with relatively few adverse symptoms, particularly when compared with control subjects taking placebo. Reductions in negative emotional states (tension and anger) were observed for subjects receiving atenolol, and the largest improvements in memory performance were observed for subjects receiving propranolol. These results suggest that beta-blocker therapy is not invariably associated with negative side effects and that some behavioral functions may actually be improved.\r"

This resulted in a significantly greater enantiomeric oral clearance ratio in the young when compared with the elderly subjects (8.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.01). No significant difference (P greater than 0.05) in pharmacologic response after hexobarbital administration was found between the two groups.

Nimodipine, but not verapamil and flunarizine, inhibit noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction as well. Verapamil, locally administered into the hand vein, inhibits 5HT and noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction. These results suggest that only calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type have antivenoconstrictive activity in the hand vein at oral clinical doses, whereas verapamil is active only if administered by the intravenous route, which probably produces local plasma concentrations higher than those reached with the oral clinical doses.\r"

The log10 of the metabolic ratio was unimodally, but not normally, distributed and showed the following values: mean -0.21 +/- 0.26, median -0.24, limits -0.73 and 0.76, skewness 1.00, and kurtosis 4.95. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that there are no deficient metabolizers in the Cuna sample population studied. However, the similarity of the skewness found between the Cuna sample population studied and the extensive Canadian white group, as well as an inflection point at 6.3 U in the former's probit plot, suggests the existence of at least two subgroups congregating within the same single mode in the frequency distribution curve. The use of the inflection point is discussed thoroughly, concluding that although it does not allow exclusion of the existence of genotypically different subgroups, the limitations of the data do not permit its use to determine the number of heterozygotes and thus the existence of polymorphism. The possibility of an isozyme variant, consistent with the general genetic structure of Amerindians, as suggested by the coexistence of two subgroups within the unimodal curve, is entertained.\r"

After a single oral dose the time to peak plasma diltiazem concentration was 3.4 (2.1 to 5.0) hours and the elimination half-life was 6.6 hours (4.4 to 10.8 hours). These were unchanged after repeated oral administration (16 to 19 doses). The mean trough (8 hours after administration) plasma diltiazem level after six consecutive doses was 167 micrograms/L (63 to 286 micrograms/L) and was thereafter stable. With chronic administration the AUC increased by a factor of 2.24 +/- 0.31 (SEM; P less than 0.01). Plasma protein binding of diltiazem in these patients ranged from 83% to 93% whereas deacetyldiltiazem binding ranged from 58% to 75%. Plasma protein binding was independent of drug concentration and duration of treatment. Thus an average dose of 120 mg diltiazem given every 8 hours would appear to be a suitable regimen of treatment in most patients with angina pectoris, although users should be aware that there is a significant interpatient variability in steady-state diltiazem concentrations and that a significant accumulation of diltiazem occurs with chronic therapy.\r"

Intravenous infusion of cilazapril (1 mg/kg followed by 25 micrograms min-1 kg-1) caused significant reductions of blood pressure from 163 +/- 3 to 122 +/- 4 mmHg and from 157 +/- 2 to 113 +/- 3 mmHg in two separate groups of hypertensive rats and from 124 +/- 1 to 105 +/- 2 mmHg in normotensive rats. The hypotensive effect in terms of absolute value of percentage change was greater in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats (41 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 3 mmHg or 25 +/- 4% vs 16 +/- 2%, respectively). 3. Cilazapril increased glomerular filtration rate, urine flow, and absolute and fractional excretion rates of sodium and potassium in the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive rats. In contrast, the clipped kidney exhibited a depressed renal function during cilazapril infusion. 4. In normotensive rats, the hypotensive and enhanced renal function responses to cilazapril were much less than those of the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive rats. 5. Superimposed administration of either angiotensin II or angiotensin III during cilazapril infusion completely reversed the blood pressure and bilateral renal responses of cilazapril in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. 6. These results indicate that cilazapril reduces arterial pressure and enhances renal excretion mainly via inhibition of angiotensin II and angiotensin III formation.\r"

These solutions were nebulized ultrasonically and breathed for 1 min periods by seven subjects in random order and on separate days. Cough frequency during each 1 min inhalation was recorded. Only the two solutions of extreme pH (2.6 and 10.0) caused cough. 3. The effect of altering the osmolarity of the inhaled aerosol on cough was assessed using D-glucose over a range of 77-1232 mosmol/l. Saline solutions over the same range of osmolarity were also tested. The pH of D-glucose was raised to match that of saline by adding small amounts of sodium hydroxide. All solutions were nebulized and inhaled by seven subjects as described above for 1 min periods during which cough frequency was recorded. Forced expired volume in 1 s was recorded after each inhalation and did not alter in any subject by more than 10%. Subjects coughed when inhaling all the D-glucose solutions over the whole range of osmolarity. Cough occurred with saline solutions only at low chloride concentration and at the highest concentration. 4. In order to clarify whether the response to hypertonic saline was due to the high ionic content of the solutions or to its hypertonicity, two other solutions were tested. These were an isotonic and a hypertonic mixture of D-glucose and saline, containing 'normal' (150 mmol/l) ionic content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypertensive 1K, 1C rats were anaesthetized and a carotid and jugular cannula were inserted for BP measurement and anaesthetic infusion respectively. After a stable level of anaesthesia was attained, the constrictive clip was removed and BP was recorded for 30 min. 3. Blood was drawn from the aorta directly into ice-cold acetone. The extract was analysed for PAF by a bioassay using 5-hydroxy-[14C]tryptamine-labelled platelets. 4. Rats which showed a BP fall had elevated levels of PAF [55 +/- 6 (SEM) pg/ml] (P less than 0.01). 5. This supports the hypothesis that activation of PAF biosynthesis may be a mechanism contributing to the fall in BP seen after unclipping the 1K, 1C hypertensive rat.\r"

To investigate this further, plasma catecholamines and potassium (K+) were monitored during a game of squash in six normal volunteers. 2. No cardiac arrhythmias were seen in this study despite the subjects reaching maximum heart rates of 181 +/- 5 beats/min (mean +/- SEM). 3. During exercise, plasma K+ rose from 3.82 +/- 0.16 to 4.29 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, but after 90 s rest this fell to 3.68 +/- 0.28 mmol/l and after 180 s to 3.44 +/- 0.17 mmol/l. This rapid K+ shift could not be accounted for by generalized changes in venous acid-base status or by changes in venous plasma catecholamines. Although pretreatment with a beta 2-antagonist caused the overall plasma K+ levels to be higher, it had no significant effect on the fall in plasma K+ after exercise. 4. Such rapid K+ shifts after exercise might contribute to arrhythmogenesis in susceptible individuals. The precise mechanism of the fall in K+ after exercise remains undetermined, but it seems not to involve catecholamines stimulating beta 2-adrenoceptors and is more likely to be due to increased skeletal muscle blood flow and/or intracellular acidosis.\r"

Lactate uptake was independent of glucose concentration in the range 5-10 mmol/l, but was slightly inhibited with time at 20 mmol/l glucose. This pattern was independent of perfusate pH. 3. At both pH values lactate uptake decreased proportionally with flow, and at low flow lactate was produced by the livers. The effect of flow was greatest at pH 7.4 where a net lactate production was found at 48% of normal flow, whereas at pH 6.8 lactate production was not seen until the flow was reduced to 33% of normal. 4. When glucose was omitted from the perfusate lactate production ceased at both pH values. 5. The effect of low pH on lactate uptake and production in liver probably reflects inhibition of glycolysis by low pH.\r"

A model of controlled hypoxia in the isolated perfused rat kidney has been used to compare the extent of reduction in the steady-state level of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) from that initially observed with alterations in renal function and with the development of tubular cell injury. 2. ATP depletion was observed in response to decreased total oxygen delivery even when delivery greatly exceeded consumption and the venous oxygen tension remained in excess of 150 mmHg. 3. Increases in the fractional excretion of sodium occurred progressively below an apparent threshold value of whole kidney ATP of approximately 80% of the baseline. 4. With modestly decreased oxygen delivery, cellular injury was confined to deep proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Severely decreased oxygen delivery rates were associated with cellular damage spreading throughout the cortex. 5. Even the smallest reductions in whole kidney ATP were associated with morphological damage to tubular cells. The extent of reduction in whole kidney ATP was closely correlated and approximately equivalent to the calculated volume of injured cells. 6. Our results indicate that reduction in whole kidney ATP during decreased oxygen delivery is a valid marker of the extent of injurious cellular hypoxia and are consistent with the view that cellular ATP concentrations in hypoxia are markedly inhomogeneous. They support the hypothesis that specific regions of the perfused kidney become critically hypoxic and develop cellular injury while overall oxygen delivery remains high. Areas at risk include deep proximal tubule as well as the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop.\r"

We investigated acid stimulated alkaline secretion by proximal rabbit duodenal mucosa in an Ussing-chamber under different luminal acid concentrations and its relation to mucosal damage. Luminal alkalinisation and potential difference (PD) were measured and mucosal damage was investigated histologically. Luminal acid caused an increase of alkaline secretion over baseline (0.95 +/- 0.19 mu Eq/cm2/10 min; n = 55): 0.1 mmol: 7%, 1 mmol/l: 17%, 5 mmol/l: 22%, 10 mmol/l: 33%, 20 mmol/l: 34%, 50 mmol: 39%, 100 mmol/l: 27%. At acid concentrations of 10 mmol/l and above the PD fell from 2.0 +/- 1.0 mV to zero. Histology showed [H+]-dependent mucosal damage ranging from villus tip lesions to deep mucosal injury. Stimulation of alkaline secretion was not specific for acid. Ethanol (14%) stimulated alkaline secretion by 26%, and 28% ethanol by 40% over baseline. Ouabain and/or anoxia sensitive (active) alkaline secretion constituted 80% and 100% respectively of basal alkaline secretion. After exposure to various luminal acid concentrations passive diffusion (sensitive only to removal of nutrient HCO3-) was solely responsible for the rise in alkaline secretion. Only after 14% ethanol a small rise in ouabain and/or anoxia sensitive HCO3- transport was observed. Under the conditions of this study stimulation of duodenal alkaline secretion is not specific for luminal acid, but occurs also with luminal ethanol; both agents stimulate alkaline secretion depending on their concentration. In this model passive diffusion of HCO3- associated with increasing mucosal damage is the major component of the rise in alkaline secretion.\r"

Duration of ulcer history, number of relapses, duration of the last and present relapse, number, duration and severity of pain attacks in the present ulcer relapse, pain radiation to back, vomiting, appetite, smoking habit, intake of analgesics and previous haemorrhage were registered. Number of ulcers, ulcer depth, bublar narrowing, erosions, duodenitis at initial endoscopy and healing of ulcer were assessed by one endoscopist. Basic and peak acid output were measured. The extent of duodenitis on the site opposite the ulcer was determined by histological examination. Sixty per cent of the duodenal ulcers were healed after three weeks. By univariate analysis, the following factors affect the healing; pain radiation to back and pain duration during treatment (p less than 0.001), multiple or deep ulcers, narrowing of duodenal bulb (p less than 0.01), number of pain attacks and poor appetite (p less than 0.05). By the stepwise logistic regression model, the following factors were selected as predictors for healing of duodenal ulcer with 76% correct classification: pain radiation to back (p = 0.002), deep ulcer (p = 0.013), multiple ulcers (p = 0.028). Number of cigarettes/day (p less than 0.007) and male sex (p = 0.036). By this model, the prediction of healing could be accurately assessed in 78% in a new sample. Individual treatment should be carried out on the basis of these factors.\r"

Infusion of the lipid emulsion into the jejunum also significantly reduced the sensations of hunger before the meal (p less than 0.05), and the rate of ingestion (p less than 0.01). Ileal infusion did not influence these indices. The results suggest that jejunal and ileal infusion of lipid reduces the size of the meal that could be consumed possibly by inhibiting gastric emptying. The alleviation of hunger before ingestion and the slower rate of eating, however, suggests that jejunal lipid activates an additional mechanism that influences the appetite centre in the hypothalamus directly.\r"

Orocaecal transit was consistently faster in these patients than a group of controls and was associated with malabsorption of glucose. Codeine phosphate 60 mg significantly delayed transit in patients and controls and was associated with a reduction in glucose malabsorption and improvement in symptoms. Loperamide also delayed transit and improved symptoms, but the doses required for this effect (12-24 mg) were higher than usually considered necessary in secretory diarrhoea. These studies indicate that rapid intestinal nutrient transit and associated malabsorption is a factor in the development of diarrhoea postvagotomy and that symptomatic relief can be achieved in most patients by more rational use of existing drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Azodisalicylate (ADS) is one of the newly developed substitutes of sulphasalazine consisting of two molecules of 5-amino-salicylic acid. Azodisalicylate caused diarrhoea in some patients, apparently caused by an antiabsorptive secretagogue action of this compound. The mechanism of this was studied in the short circuited isolated mucosa of the rat ileum. Mucosal addition of ADS increased the potential difference (PD) and short circuit current (Isc) at a concentration of 1.3.10(-4) mol/l (4 mg/dl) with maximal effects at 1.3.10(-3) mol/l (40 mg/dl). Epithelial resistance was only slightly decreased at the higher concentrations of 40 and 100 mg/dl. Serosal ADS had no effect on electrical parameters. The increase of Isc was associated with a change of net chloride absorption into net secretion. Net sodium absorption was only slightly and not significantly decreased. The changes were reversible after rinsing away the ADS. Treatment of the mucosa with furosemide inhibited the ADS induced increase of Isc, suggesting transcellular pathway for the ADS stimulated secretion. Biosynthesis of prostaglandins is not involved in the mechanism of this secretion, as treatment with indomethacin did not alter the effect of ADS on Isc. Results suggest that ADS can be considered as a secretagogue, which stimulates intestinal secretion via a transcellular pathway. Because of the bacterial cleavage of the double molecule into two molecules of the non-secretagogue 5-amino-salicylic acid in the colon, however, diarrhoea may develop only in patients with a decreased absorptive capacity of the colon, or insufficient cleavage of ADS.\r"

All were significantly more common (p less than 0.001) in patients with active than quiescent colitis and their prevalence was similar in those with total and distal colitis, indicating that these symptoms are related to an inflamed and irritable distal colon. Twenty seven per cent of patients with active colitis voided hard stools indicative of constipation, however, and this was more common in active, than quiescent colitis (p less than 0.05). This feature is probably secondary to faecal stasis in the proximal colon, and an apt description of the bowel disturbance in ulcerative colitis, irrespective of the extent of disease is that the colon suffers from proximal constipation and distal irritability.\r"

There has been a large increase from 0.18 cases/10(5) of the population per year in the 1930s to current values of 8.3/10(5)/year. The incidence continues to rise and shows an increasing proportion of patients with colorectal disease. Peak age specific incidences occur in the third and eighth decades of life.\r"

  ".W": "A population case controlled study of smoking habits at the time of diagnosis was done in 260 patients with ulcerative colitis and 144 with Crohn's disease. Smokers had a decreased risk of acquiring ulcerative colitis in comparison with never smokers (relative risk 0.7) which appeared to be dose dependent. In former smokers a rebound effect was seen, especially in former heavy smokers, where the risk was sharply increased (relative risk 4.4). No sex difference was recorded. Smoking doubled the risk of acquiring Crohn's disease without any dose dependent pattern. In former smokers a non-significantly increased risk was observed. This might be caused by a carry over effect after stopping smoking, however, which possibly is reduced by time. No sex difference was seen.\r"

  ".W": "The operation of total pancreatectomy is performed rarely. Its role in the management of patients with chronic pancreatitis remains to be elucidated. We have reviewed our series of 29 total pancreatectomies for benign disease [14 women median age 39 years; 15 men median age 34 years]. Twelve underwent standard total pancreatectomy, in 17 duodenum preserving total pancreatectomy (DPTP) was performed. There was one death (mortality 3.4%). In no patient was the total pancreatectomy the first operative procedure. The patients were compared with age and sex matched diabetic control subjects selected on a best fit basis from the diabetic clinic database. The aetiology of the pancreatitis was idiopathic nine, pancreas divisum nine, alcohol eight and other causes three. The indication for surgery was pain 27, acute pancreatitis one and cholangitis with pancreatitis one. The complications of the procedures were mainly caused by infection [wound three, chest six and central line sepsis four] and in two there was a leak from the duodenum; no patient required re-operation. The postoperative stay [standard total, median 21 days (range 13-98) DPTP median 31 days (range 17-49)] has lengthened over the period due to greater attention to analgesic, diabetic and enzyme deficiency control before discharge. In standard total pancreatectomy there were five major hypoglycaemic episodes with only two in 17 DPTP patients. The per cent ideal body weight, the insulin requirement and the HbAl compared less well in standard total pancreatectomy group compared with controls than did DPTP. With both groups large doses of enzyme replacement were required, and this proved of importance in diabetic control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Jaundiced babies undergoing phototherapy often develop diarrhoea. The cause of it is still uncertain. Increasing evidence supports a role of a secretory mechanism for the diarrhoea. We therefore studied the effects of bile from congenitally jaundiced rats undergoing phototherapy and of unconjugated bilirubin on rat small intestine in vivo and in vitro. Results suggest that: (1) the bile from homozygous Gunn rats under phototherapy has an anti-absorptive effect when tested in the perfused jejunum of normal Wistar rats; (2) unconjugated bilirubin has a dose dependent secretory effect on the intestinal transport of water and electrolytes, when tested in the same system. Alteration of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, known intracellular mediators of secretion, was not observed. We conclude that free bilirubin is an intestinal secretagogue acting by an as yet unknown mechanism, that may mediate the secretory type of diarrhoea in jaundiced neonates undergoing phototherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Transiliac biopsies from 34 female patients with corticosteroid treated chronic active hepatitis have been examined to determine the contributions made by decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption to bone loss associated with this condition and to determine the structural basis of the bone loss. Mean wall thickness was significantly reduced when compared with control values (p less than 0.001) as was the bone formation rate at tissue (p less than 0.005) and basic multicellular unit (p less than 0.005) level. The osteoid maturation period and the bone formation period were significantly prolonged (p less than 0.02 and 0.05). The total resorption surfaces were significantly increased (p less than 0.02) but the mean interstitial bone thickness was normal. The mean trabecular plate thickness was significantly reduced (p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that decreased bone formation plays a major role in bone loss associated with corticosteroid treated chronic active hepatitis and that the structural basis of bone loss is trabecular thinning.\r"
