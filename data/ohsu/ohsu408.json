  ".U": "88184307\r", 
  ".W": "The relation between blood glucose concentration, the symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia, and electroencephalographic changes in diabetic patients is not known. The effect of hypoglycaemia on brain function was studied in 13 patients with insulin dependent diabetes. During a gradual fall in blood glucose concentration induced by a bolus injection of insulin followed by an intravenous infusion of insulin, during 60 minutes of biochemical hypoglycaemia, and after restoration of normoglycaemia with intravenous glucose electroencephalograms were evaluated continuously by period-amplitude analysis; blood samples were taken every 10 minutes throughout. No changes were seen in electroencephalograms when the blood glucose concentration was above 3 mmol/l. At a median blood glucose concentration of 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 2.3) mmol/l alpha activity decreased abruptly in the electroencephalograms concomitant with an increase in theta activity, reflecting neuronal dysfunction in the cortex. When the blood glucose concentration was further lowered changes were observed in the electroencephalograms indicating that deeper brain structures were affected. A normal electroencephalogram was re-established at a blood glucose concentration of 2.0 (1.8 to 2.1) mmol/l. There was no significant correlation between the blood glucose concentration at the onset of changes in the electroencephalograms and age, duration of diabetes, insulin dose, haemoglobin A1c concentration, initial blood glucose concentration, rate of fall in blood glucose concentration, and appearance of symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia. Changes in electroencephalograms during hypoglycaemia appear and disappear at such a narrow range of blood glucose concentrations that the term threshold blood glucose concentration for the onset of such changes seems justified.\r"

  ".U": "88184308\r", 
  ".W": "Concern about the side effects of various anaesthetic agents in newborn infants has led to the widespread use of anaesthesia with unsupplemented nitrous oxide and oxygen with muscle relaxants in such patients. To investigate the efficacy of such a regimen 36 neonates undergoing operations were randomised to two groups: one group received anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and curare alone and the other was additionally given halothane. Concentrations of metabolites and hormones were measured before and at the end of operation and at six, 12, and 24 hours after operation and the values compared between the two groups. Neonates given halothane anaesthesia showed decreased hormonal responses to operation, with significant differences between the two groups in the changes in adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol concentrations and the ratio of insulin to glucagon concentration. Changes in blood concentrations of glucose and total ketone bodies and plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids were also decreased in neonates receiving halothane anaesthesia. Neonates given anaesthesia with unsupplemented nitrous oxide showed significantly greater increases in the urinary ratio of 3-methylhistidine to creatinine concentration and their clinical condition was also more unstable during and after operation. Unless specifically contraindicated potent anaesthesia with halothane or other anaesthetic agents should be given to all neonates undergoing surgical operations as it decreases their stress responses and improves their clinical stability during and after operation.\r"

Only two epidemics occurred, one in 1967 and one in 1980, both of which were immediately followed by two to three years of low incidence. The age distribution of the disease appears to be changing, with more cases now being reported in children aged 0-4 years. The number of deaths in adults have, however, increased, particularly those deaths that are associated with pneumonia and immunosuppression. At present in England and Wales more deaths are attributed to chickenpox than to whooping cough and mumps. Widespread use of selective immunisation against chickenpox might be justified in England and Wales, but before routine immunisation of the child population can be considered special surveys to determine the incidence and severity of chickenpox and the effect of the vaccine on the subsequent development of herpes zoster are needed as well as cost-benefit studies of immunisation.\r"

Reference values for the test were established for the middle of pregnancy (14-20 weeks, n = 43) and late pregnancy (28-37 weeks, n = 168). One woman was excluded because she had diabetes that required treatment with insulin. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups for samples taken both one and two hours after the glucose load. Reference ranges for the interpretation of the glucose tolerance test in pregnancy should therefore take account of the period of gestation. Arbitrary upper limits of normal (represented by the 97.5 centile) two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load are proposed at 7.5 and 9.6 mmol/l for the second and third trimesters, respectively.\r"

For cancer of the cervix the median age at death increased appreciably whereas for cancer of the lung in women it slightly decreased. The median age at death is easy to calculate, does not require standardisation, and has a useful role.\r"

Five minute appointments had been chosen by 124 of the 309 patients who returned completed questionnaires, 10 minute appointments by 155, and 15 minute appointments by 30. Mean consultation times were 6.1, 9.2, and 12.9 minutes, respectively. Altogether 298 patients liked the system. An appointment system that was flexible while remaining practical and efficient resulted from letting patients choose the length of their appointment. Such a system encourages patients to share in the responsibility of organising a practice efficiently.\r"

Data collected for the audit provided a valuable baseline for the unit, defining aspects of practice that could be reviewed and improved. During the audit the overall rate of complications as a percentage of admissions fell significantly from 13% to 9% and the rate of postoperative complications decreased significantly from 16% in 1982 to 11% in 1986. The incidence of chest and wound infections also decreased significantly. The system was improved by using the data to produce discharge summaries as well as audit; the microcomputer thus became an integral part of the office work of the unit.\r"

The findings suggest that the fruitless dichotomy of \"organic versus functional\" should be replaced by a multifactorial approach. Most important, epidemiological studies with explicit operational case definition are essential before progress can be made in the management of this distressing disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of chemotherapy in clinical situations is limited frequently because of the associated toxicity to normal bone marrow cells, gastrointestinal epithelium, and other host tissues. Although nutritional support has been advocated to reduce chemotherapy-related toxicity in cancer patients, few studies substantiate this clinical impression. The current study was performed to determine the role of nutritional status and enteral nutrient intake as determinants of methotrexate (MTX) toxicity in a well-controlled, tumor-bearing animal model. After subcutaneous mammary tumor (AC-33) inoculation, 56 female Lewis/Wistar rats were assigned randomly to one of the following two nutritional regimens for 14 days: (1) protein-depleted chow (PC) (0.03% protein; 4.27 kcal/g) or (2) standard chow (RC) (22.0% protein; 3.50 kcal/g). After 7 days of dietary control, all animals received one of three weight-adjusted doses of MTX (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] ) or placebo. All animals received leucovorin rescue (0.6 mg IM) at 6 and 24 hours after MTX injection. Improved nutritional status was associated with a significant reduction in objective measures of MTX-related morbidity and mortality. At low doses of MTX (5 and 10 mg/kg), the mean duration of clinical signs of toxicity (i.e., hair loss, lethargy, and diarrhea) and severity of leukopenia were greater in protein-depleted (PD) animals. With high-dose MTX (20 mg/kg), mortality was increased significantly in PD animals (100%) compared with well-nourished animals (0%). Equivalent tumor response was observed in PD and well-nourished animals. Thus, improved nutritional status by enteral nutrition reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with MTX significantly in this tumor-bearing animal model.\r"

  ".W": "A human salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell line was cultivated in the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dB-cAMP), cis-diammine dichloroplatinum (cisplatin) or mitomycin C (MMC) only, or of the combination of dB-cAMP and each of the antineoplastic drugs. Then the treated cells were examined for the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), colony-forming efficiency (CFE) in semisolid agar medium and cell survival as measured by counting for viable cells. It has been found that the frequency of SCE induction is significantly increased by treatment of cells with cisplatin or MMC under the presence of dB-cAMP, when compared to that in the cells treated with cisplatin or MMC only. Moreover, marked reduction in CFE and cell survival was found to occur in the cells treated with the combination of dB-cAMP and cisplatin or MMC. These finding indicate that treatment of a human salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell line with dB-cAMP results in modification of SCE induction, CFE and cell survival in the cells exposed to cisplatin or MMC.\r"

Moderate-dose radiation therapy (2500 to 3000 cGy in 2 to 3 weeks) was given to anatomic areas involved initially by lymphoma in patients demonstrated to be in complete remission after chemotherapy. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were free of lymphoma clinically after induction chemotherapy. The minimum patient follow-up from the start of chemotherapy is 3.7 years, and the median follow-up for patients still alive is 4.7 years. The progression-free survival is projected to be 62% at 4 years, and 86% of the patients achieving a complete response are projected to be in continuous remission at 4 years from the completion of all therapy. There were no treatment-related fatalities. This treatment sequence has produced durable tumor control in the majority of patients with acceptable toxicity. The need for consolidation radiation therapy is being studied currently in a controlled clinical trial.\r"

Some of the patients and controls were tobacco consumers (TC). A mean spontaneous SCE per cell value of 8.36 obtained for the patients was higher significantly (P less than 0.001) compared with a SCE per cell value of 6.74 for the controls. It was noticed that the elevation was significant even when persons in both groups were separated and compared on the basis of tobacco consumption. Among the controls, TC had higher SCE compared with non-tobacco consumers (NTC) (P less than 0.01). Mitomycin C (MMC) was used as a mutagen. No significant difference was observed in MMC-induced rates of SCE between the patients and controls. The cellular kinetics, expressed as average generation time (AGT), also were comparable in both groups. It was concluded that either metabolic stress imposed by the tumor or some clastogenic secretion of malignant cells was responsible for elevated SCE rates in the lymphocytes of the esophageal cancer patients. The disease had no effect on mutagen-induced SCE rates or cellular kinetics in lymphocytes.\r"

During two courses of cytostatic drug administration peak and trough plasma levels of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate sodium were measured. Lower plasma levels of carbamazepine and valproate sodium were observed after 2 days of antineoplastic therapy. Normal plasma levels of these drugs were found 2 to 3 days after the last cisplatin dose. Impaired absorption or accelerated elimination might explain these results. Phenytoin levels were reduced to 37% of the original values, although the drug was given intravenously. Changed Michaelis-Menten parameters suggest that cisplatin increases the metabolic rate of phenytoin. Another explanation for the decreased drug levels might be an increased volume of distribution. Calculation of this volume from peak and trough levels showed an increase of the volume of distribution during and after chemotherapy.\r"

Diazepam was given alone, after a single dose of fluoxetine, and after eight daily doses of fluoxetine. Psychometric data showed that fluoxetine had no significant effect on the psychomotor responses to diazepam. However, the pharmacokinetic data indicated a change in diazepam disposition after fluoxetine administration. Diazepam AUC was larger, the half-life was longer, and the plasma clearance was lower after fluoxetine administration, suggesting that fluoxetine inhibited the metabolism of diazepam. The reduced formation of an active metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, also suggested that fluoxetine inhibited diazepam's metabolism. The clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction are minor because psychomotor responses were unaffected and offsetting changes in the kinetics of diazepam and its metabolite occurred. Dosage modification of either fluoxetine or diazepam is unlikely to be necessary.\r"

We have now investigated a further non-endocrine, renal interaction between ANP and the RAAS. 2. The effects of ANP and angiotensin II (ANG II) alone, and in combination, on urinary electrolyte and water excretion were studied in eight normal male subjects undergoing maximal water diuresis. 3. ANP caused a significant increase in urine flow and sodium excretion. ANG II alone was antidiuretic, antinatriuretic and antikaliuretic. When ANP was given against a background infusion of ANG II, urinary flow rate and electrolyte excretion increased from a new lower level to reach a value intermediate between that found with ANG II alone and ANP alone. 4. It is concluded that the renal effects of ANP are modified in the presence of simultaneously elevated levels of ANG II and that net water and electrolyte excretion reflect the sum of the opposing influences of each peptide. While this interplay may be non-specific, it is possible that ANP may exert some of its actions by specifically inhibiting the intrarenal effects of ANG II.\r"

The relative effects of changes in mucosal surface area and mucosal permeability on the passive uptakes of mannitol and raffinose have been studied in vitro using jejunal biopsies from 48 controls, 32 patients with coeliac disease and 11 patients with Crohn's disease. Total mucosal permeation was corrected for surface area measured morphometrically to provide an index of mucosal permeability. 2. In untreated coeliac disease, permeation of mannitol was reduced by 35% (P = 0.006) and that of raffinose was increased by 66% (P = 0.0095) compared with controls, whereas mucosal permeability to mannitol was increased twofold (P = 0.009) and to raffinose fivefold (P = 0.0001). Mucosal permeability was similar for each sugar. 3. In treated coeliac disease, permeation and permeability for mannitol were normal, but remained elevated for raffinose by 23% (P = 0.036) and 41% (P = 0.024), respectively. 4. In Crohn's disease, permeation of mannitol was reduced by 21%, but that of raffinose and mucosal permeability to both sugars were normal. 5. These findings suggest that surface area is quantitatively more important than mucosal permeability in determining the total permeation of mannitol, while the converse is true for raffinose. The findings are compatible with paracellular uptake of raffinose, but with both paracellular and transcellular uptake of mannitol. Both pathways are affected in coeliac disease, whereas only transcellular uptake is affected in Crohn's disease.\r"

Subsequently, responses to sublingual nitroglycerin were measured in group I and II subjects. 2. Controls responded to nitroglycerin with an increase in venous distensibility; group II patients had higher initial venous distensibility but did not respond to nitroglycerin. No other variables in either group were affected by nitroglycerin. 3. Group II and III patients differed in forearm blood flow and vascular resistance and venous distensibility. A significant inverse correlation was found between age and forearm blood flow (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001) in all patients with cirrhosis. 4. We conclude that (a) venous tone is reduced in cirrhosis, possibly as a result of chronic venodilatation; (b) this venodilatation impedes further dilatory response to a small dose of nitroglycerin; (c) cirrhosis is also associated with age-related decreases in peripheral haemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "The lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and leucotriene B4 (LTB4), are considered to have an important pathophysiological role in inflammatory bowel disease by stimulating the inflammatory response and by contributing to the diarrhoea. The present studies were designed to investigate the effect of the physiological stimulants bradykinin (BK) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in addition to the influence of the calcium ionophore A23187, on the source of AA release and 5-lipoxygenation in human neutrophils (PMNs) in vitro. This was done to elucidate the specificity of the mechanism by which PMNs respond to physiological, extracellular Ca2+ dependent agonists. The results of the study indicate that stimulation of 1-14C-AA-prelabelled PMNs with BK liberates AA mainly from phosphatidylinositol, while A23187 causes release of AA from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and possibly phosphatidylserine. Furthermore BK (10(-9)-10(-6)M) dose-dependently stimulated the formation of 5-HETE and LTB4, reaching a maximum at 10(-7)M, while 5-HT (10(-8)-10(-4)M) released only negligible amounts of eicosanoids, similar to those observed in control experiments. Stimulation with A23187 (10(-5)M) caused a high release of both 5-HETE and LTB4. These results offer evidence that BK, but not 5-HT, initiates formation of lipoxygenase products by binding to specific receptors on the external surface of PMNs, whereas A23187 accelerates 5-lipoxygenation through mechanisms which do not involve a cell surface receptor.\r"

One hundred and ninety five new patients were diagnosed and 313 patients seen and followed up in the clinic for 1168 patient years. None of these patients died from colitis or a complication. On routine colonoscopy three cases had high grade dysplasia and two asymptomatic carcinomas (Duke's stage A and B). Eighty four patients were known to have ulcerative colitis, but were lost to follow up from the hospital clinic; the total time they were not under hospital surveillance was 315 patient years. At the end of the study these patients were contacted or clinical details obtained from their general practitioners. Five of these patients subsequently presented with symptomatic carcinomas (two Duke's B, one Duke's C and two with metastases); three of these five patients have died from their tumours. Of 48 patients thought to have only mild colitis on initial investigation 21 (43%) had substantial colitis (and two carcinomas) on colonoscopy after eight years of disease. Therefore, patients with apparently distal colitis should be followed in the clinic as well as those with known extensive colitis. For a surveillance programme in a district general hospital, eight patients per 100,000 population need to be seen weekly, 12 colonoscopies/100,000 population need to be carried out annually and the cost for each carcinoma detected is approximately 6015 pounds.\r"

Nitroglycerin infusion alone (200 micrograms/min) produced a significant fall in portal pressure (WHVP-FHVP) (from 16.4 (0.6) to 13.3 (1.2) mmHg; p less than .001) associated with hypotension (mean arterial pressure from 95 (7) to 78 (9) mmHg; p less than 0.005). Vasopressin alone (0.4 IU/min) reduced portal pressure (20.7 (1.3) to 14.0 (1.3) mmHg; p less than 0.001), but there was considerable variation in the systemic haemodynamic changes with increased cardiac output in four of six patients. The combination of vasopressin and nitroglycerin corrected all systemic haemodynamic disturbances produced by either agent alone. This combination led, however, to a further reduction in portal pressure (from 13.7 (0.9) to 11.7 (0.7) mmHg p less than 0.01). These results show that: (1) intravenous nitroglycerin reduces portal pressure, and (2) the combination of nitroglycerin and vasopressin reverses systemic haemodynamic disturbances produced by either agent alone and leads to a further decrease in portal pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanism of the action of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is thought to involve activation of guanylate cyclase. Increasing evidence shows a direct tubular effect of ANF. Part of the ANF-induced diuresis has been suggested to be due to inhibition of the action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the cortical collecting tubule. In this study we investigated the effect of ANF on cyclic nucleotide production in primary cultures of cortical collecting tubule cells immunodissected with a monoclonal antibody. ANF caused a dose-dependent stimulation in cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) production; the half-maximal stimulation was observed at approximately 1 nM of ANF. ANF (0.01-100 nM) had no effect on cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in cortical collecting tubule cultures. AVP caused a dose-dependent increase in cAMP production, and this effect was not altered by the simultaneous addition of ANF (100 nM). Similarly, ANF-induced cGMP stimulation was not influenced by AVP (10 nM). We conclude that 1) ANF has a direct stimulatory action on cGMP production by cultured cortical collecting tubule cells and 2) any interaction between ANF and AVP is likely to occur at steps distal to cyclic nucleotide formation.\r"

We hypothesized that if central command signals are critical to a normal ventilatory response, then ExE should cause a slower ventilatory response resulting in hypercapnia at the onset of exercise. ExE was induced through surface electrodes placed over the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. ExE and ExV produced leg extension (40/min) against a spring load that increased CO2 production (VCO2) 100-1,000 ml/min above resting level. PaCO2 and arterial pH during work transitions and in the steady state did not differ significantly from rest (P greater than 0.05) or between ExE and ExV. The temporal pattern of ventilation, tidal volume, breathing frequency, and inspired and expired times, and the ventilation-VCO2 relationship were similar between ExE and ExV. We conclude that since central command was reduced and/or eliminated by ExE, central command is not requisite for the precise matching of alveolar ventilation to increases in VCO2 during low-intensity muscle contractions.\r"

  ".U": "88186656\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the role of spinal afferent pathways in the hyperpnea of electrically induced muscle contractions (ExE). The ventilatory (VE) and arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) responses were measured at rest and during two levels of ExE in awake human paraplegic subjects with clinically complete lesions of the spinal cord (range T4-T11). We hypothesized that if peripheral neural drive is critical to a normal ventilatory response, then ExE in the absence of intact pathways should cause a lower ventilatory response resulting in hypercapnia at the onset of ExE. ExE was induced by stimulation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles that approximately doubled the resting level of CO2 production (VCO2). PaCO2 during work transitions and in the latter stages of ExE did not differ significantly from that at rest. Arterial pH progressively declined over time during ExE (P less than 0.01) as a result of increased lactate concentration (P less than 0.01). The linear relationship between VE and VCO2 was similar to that found for normal human subjects during ExE (P = 0.73). These data suggest that VE and presumably alveolar ventilation (VA) can be appropriately matched to VCO2 during low-intensity muscle contractions of the lower extremities in the absence of intact spinal afferent pathways. Moreover, since it is unlikely that postulated \"central command\" mechanisms were initiated during ExE in these paraplegic subjects, the data provide support for our previous conclusion that central command is not obligatory for matching VA to VCO2 (J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 218-225, 1988).\r"

  ".W": "In eight anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, we determined whether diaphragmatic blood flow is dependent on arterial blood pressure (Pa) or whether it is autoregulated. We also determined whether diaphragmatic muscular activity affects the degree of autoregulation. We measured blood flow through the left phrenic artery (Qphr) with an electromagnetic flow probe and decreased Pa in steps by controlled hemorrhage. Phrenic venous blood was sampled to allow the calculation of diaphragmatic O2 consumption (VO2phr). Diaphragmatic energy demands were varied by using three inspiratory resistances (R1, R2, and R3), which increased peak transdiaphragmatic pressure two-, three-, and fourfold, respectively. During quiet breathing, Qphr was independent of Pa between Pa of 90 and 120 mmHg (i.e., plateau of pressure-flow relation), but at lower Pa, Qphr was directly related to Pa. During inspiratory loading, the Qphr plateau ended at a higher Pa than with quiet breathing, but within the normal ranges of Pa there still was a plateau. VO2phr at a given work load was constant between Pa of 70 and 120 mmHg, but at Pa of 50-55 mmHg, VO2phr declined with all work loads. We conclude that in spontaneously breathing dogs 1) Qphr is autoregulated over the normal range of blood pressures and 2) VO2phr is maintained over wider ranges of Pa than Qphr.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect on the pattern of breathing of cooling receptors in the nose, eight normal male volunteers underwent a steady-state CO2 stimulation by nasal inhalation. The inhaled gas temperature was randomly switched between \"warm\" (32 degrees C) and \"cold\" (2 degrees C) at each of three levels of inspired CO2 fraction (FICO2). Breathing cold air through the nose reduced the mean slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 by 27% (P less than 0.05) and the mean intercept at PCO2 of 45 Torr by 6.6 l/min (P less than 0.01). This was due mainly to a reduction in tidal volume (VT). Analysis of the breathing pattern recorded at a high level of minute ventilation (VE) (end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 approximately 52 Torr) showed a reduction of VE that was due almost entirely to a reduction in VT (P less than 0.05) associated with a reduction in inspiratory time (TI) as a fraction of total respiratory cycle time (P less than 0.05) but little change in VT/TI. In a separate experiment conducted with five subjects, there was no significant difference in inspired nasal resistance between warm and cold runs during CO2-stimulated breathing. The results confirm the previous observation that cold air breathed through the nose inhibits ventilation in normal subjects and show that this is not related to an increase in flow resistance. The reduction in ventilation is due to reduction in VT associated with shortening of the duty cycle.\r"

It measures the classic CO2-response slope (i.e., delta VI/delta PCO2) divided by resting ventilation Sr = (VI''--VI')/(VI'.delta PCO2) between low (')- and high ('')-inspired CO2 as the fractional increase of alveolar ventilation per Torr rise of PCO2. In steady states when CO2 excretion (VCO2') = VCO2'', Hazinski CO2-response slope (Sr) may be computed from the alveolar exchange equation as Sr = (PACO2'--PICO2')/(PACO2'--PICO2'') where PICO2 is inspired PCO2. To avoid use of a mask or mouthpiece, the subject breathes from a hood in which CO2 is mixed with inspired air and a transcutaneous CO2 electrode is used to estimate alveolar PCO2 (PACO2). To test the validity of this method, we compared the slopes measured simultaneously by the Hazinski and standard steady-state methods using a pneumotachograph, mask, and end-tidal, arterial, and four transcutaneous PCO2 samples in 15-min steady-state challenges at PICO2 23.5 +/- 4.5 and 37 +/- 4.1 Torr. Sr was computed using PACO2 and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) as well as with the four skin PCO2 (PSCO2) values. After correction for apparatus dead space, the standard method was normalized to resting VI = 1, and its CO2 slope was designated directly measured normalized CO2 slope (Sx), permitting error to be calculated as Sr/Sx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neither treatment had any effect over 2-5 h on the non-CO2-stimulated CSF ion values or blood gases. With CO2 stimulation such that arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) was increased 25 Torr over 3 h, DIDS treatment significantly decreased the stoichiometrically opposite changes in CSF [HCO3-] and [Cl-] that normally accompany hypercapnia and reflect ionic mechanisms of CSF pH regulation. Expressed as delta CSF [HCO3-]/delta PaCO2, DIDS treatment decreased the CSF ionic response by 35%. In a separate paired study design DIDS administration via the same protocol had no effect on resting ventilation but significantly increased the ventilation and tidal volume responses to a 28-Torr increase in PaCO2. Expressed as change in minute ventilation divided by delta PaCO2, DIDS treatment produced a 39.6% increase. The results support the concept of a DIDS-inhibitable anion exchange carrier being involved in CSF pH regulation in hypercapnia and suggest a DIDS-related effect on the ventilatory response to CO2.\r"

Therefore we examined the single-breath (SB) CO2 test to determine its reproducibility and applicability as a clinical test of peripheral chemoreceptor function. The technique involved the inhalation of a SB of 13% CO2 in air. The ventilatory response was determined from the increase in ventilation (VE) during the first 20 s after the test breath and from the difference in end-tidal PCO2 between the test breath and preceding control breaths. The peak increase in VE occurred during the second or third breath after the test breath, corresponding to a delay of approximately 10 s. The mean of 10 SB tests administered at 2- to 3-min intervals was taken as the subject's response. Five healthy subjects were tested in this manner on each of 6 consecutive days with the response having an interday coefficient of variation of 25 +/- 6% (SD). The response in 26 healthy females (aged 22-61 yr) was 0.32 +/- 0.11 l.min-1.Torr-1, and in 26 healthy males (aged 24-69 yr) the response was 0.38 +/- 0.14 (P NS). No significant correlation was found between the age of the subjects and their ventilatory response. Thirty-six of the subjects also underwent hyperoxic CO2 rebreathing tests, the response to which is dependent on central chemoreceptor function. No correlation was found between rebreathing and SB tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The levels of plasma cholesterol and apolipoproteins C-II, C-III, and A-I were low. Plasma TG levels, however, were not abnormally elevated, while apo E levels were within normal range.

Most of the triglyceride was in the form of chylomicrons, which had a prolonged residence time in plasma. Patients with moderate thermal injury (mean % TBSA 38% +/- 9%) had normal TG levels before fat infusion. When Liposyl was infused intraduodenally (170 mg/kg/hr), the plasma TG levels remained normal and the chylomicron half-life was very short.

The 3 year risk of anterior infarction was 2% for patients with their most severe left anterior descending stenosis less than 50%, 6% for patients with one such stenosis greater than or equal to 50% and 11% for patients with two or more such stenoses greater than or equal to 50% (p less than 0.02). Stenoses of 90 to 98% had the highest (15%) 3 year risk of anterior myocardial infarction. The three methods used to measure maximal percent stenosis differed little with regard to their predictiveness. Absolute lumen dimension was less predictive of risk. These results may provide a more rational basis on which to base coronary revascularization decisions.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this investigation was to determine whether analysis of thallium-201 images as detected by quantitative single photon emission computed tomography after a single high oral dose of dipyridamole (300 mg) would accurately detect the presence of coronary artery disease and the anatomic location of the individual stenosis. Analyses were performed on 100 patients who concomitantly underwent diagnostic coronary arteriography and myocardial imaging. Tomographic myocardial perfusion defects were quantified using computer-generated polar maps. Eighty-four patients had significant coronary artery disease defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis. The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary disease was 92% overall, 89% in patients without previous myocardial infarction and 97% in those with prior infarction. The technique had a sensitivity of 80, 87 and 51% for localizing coronary artery stenosis of the left anterior descending, the right coronary and the left circumflex artery, respectively. The corresponding specificity was 84, 92 and 92%. Furthermore, the presence of severe (greater than or equal to 70%) multivessel disease was identified with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 87%. In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography after oral dipyridamole has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary disease, ascertaining the location of stenosed vessels and identifying the presence of multivessel disease.\r"

Subjects with asthma, aged 8 to 58 years, whose asthma was well controlled taking cromolyn sodium capsules by Spinhaler turboinhaler, plus beta 2-agonists, entered the study after being maintained with cromolyn sodium capsules for a minimum of 4 weeks. The investigation began with a 2-week control interval with cromolyn sodium capsules followed by a 4-week single-blind period with placebo capsules. Subjects whose asthma significantly worsened while they were receiving placebo therapy were then randomized to a 10-week double-blind phase in which they received either active cromolyn sodium or placebo by MDI. Efficacy variables included diary data, physician evaluation, and spirometry. Comparisons were made between baseline period scores and each assessment variable over time. Of 155 subjects entered, 93 qualified for the double-blind, randomized phase. Eighty-three subjects completed the study and were analyzed. At baseline there existed no significant differences between the active-treatment and placebo-treatment groups. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) in favor of the cromolyn sodium-treatment group, however, were noted at all time points for daily diary symptoms (cough, breathlessness, and overall asthma severity), physician's assessments at each clinic visit, physician's and patient's overall final assessments, FEV1 at each clinic visit, and FVC and peak expiratory flow rate at the final visit. Concomitant bronchodilator medication use was less in the cromolyn sodium-treatment group. Cromolyn sodium by MDI is highly effective for (1) controlling asthmatic symptoms, (2) improving lung functions, and (3) decreasing the need for concomitant bronchodilators.\r"

The dose-response characteristics of zymosan-induced LTC4 generation were different from those of phagocytosis, suggesting that the two events were independent. Pretreatment of EOSs with 10(-8) mol/L of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine for 30 minutes led to a twofold to fivefold augmentation of LTC4 generation by cells subsequently activated by unopsonized zymosan. Optimal EOS activation with 1 mumol/L of the calcium ionophore A23187 at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes produced more than 100 times greater quantities of LTC4 than with zymosan. The amount of immunoreactive LTC4 that remained cell associated after calcium ionophore A23187 stimulation reached a maximum after 5 minutes and then declined. Of the relatively small amount generated in the first minute, 71% was cell associated, but this figure declined to 9% after 15 minutes, by which time there had been a redistribution of the LTC4 to the supernatant. Inflammatory leukocytes may respond to zymosan because the cells recognize either one or both of its major polysaccharide components, glucan and mannan. Glucan, but not mannan, stimulated EOSs to generate LTC4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Under optimal conditions, there was no significant difference in the total quantities of LTC4 elaborated by EOSs stimulated by glucan and by unopsonized zymosan. This suggests that zymosan may induce leukotriene generation in the human EOS through a glucan recognition mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "A 29-year-old man with pollen allergy had experienced immediate adverse reactions, such as itching of the eyes, rhinitis, wheezing, and general urticaria, after using disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) eye drops. The local symptoms were reproducible, and skin tests were strongly positive. With serum from the patient, a RAST was developed for the assay of IgE antibodies. The uptake on RAST disks was 6% of the total activity added, which was a significantly higher level than was found in sera from 35 randomly selected blood donors or in sera from 25 patients tolerating DSCG. By addition of DSCG to the patient's serum, 95% of the binding to paper disks could be inhibited. The induction of specific IgE antibodies was proposed to be a result of a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction of DSCG and a protein carrier. The substance would thus act as a hapten without any covalent binding to the carrier. DSCG may serve as a model for other nonreactive low-molecular-weight substances suspected to elicit type I-like adverse reactions.\r"

These cells are first detectable at day 18 of fetal life, about 1 day after alpha/beta, TCR-positive cells begin to appear. These early Th precursors are not dependent on the thymus for priming with Ag and MHC, and are L3T4+, Lyt-2-. Thus, these cells already have the phenotype of mature Th. In neonatal F1 animals expressing both IAk and IAb, the appearance of Th precursors restricted by either IAk or IAb is specifically inhibited by treatment of the mice with anti-IAk or anti-IAb antibodies, respectively. These results indicate that cells of mature T cell phenotype and function can arise fairly rapidly from immature, receptor-bearing precursors, once these appear. Moreover the results are in line with those previously obtained in chimeric animal experiments which suggested that specific interaction of TCR on thymocytes with class II alleles in the thymus is required for the subsequent appearance of T cells restricted by those class II alleles.\r"

Transfection with the original Ti alpha- and beta-chain genes restored CD3/Ti expression to normal levels. Whereas the parental T cell hybridoma produced IL-2 when stimulated with mAb against CD3, Thy-1, and Ly-6, the CD3/Ti negative cell failed to do so. Reconstitution of CD3/Ti expression restored normal IL-2 production in response to these mAb. A separate response to activation, the inhibition of transformed growth, was also dependent upon co-expression of CD3/Ti. These data demonstrate that cell surface expression of CD3/Ti is required for IL-2 production and growth inhibition initiated by two distinct activating molecules, and suggest that CD3/Ti may be a final common pathway for many transmembrane activation signals.\r"

  ".U": "88187356\r", 
  ".W": "The activation of BALB/c lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reaction to Mls-disparate APC has been shown to encompass up to 20% of the mature resting helper T lymphocyte population. In addition to these overtly Mls-responsive cells, our studies have revealed a second population that respond to the Mls difference of DBA/2 spleen cells in conjunction with the mitogen Con A. This part of the Mls response is therefore latent. As mitogen and Mls-stimulating effect act in synergy, it is likely that both stimuli act on the same cell, and hence the Mls effect can be regarded as a regulatory interaction between APC and Th cell. By use of congenic BALB.Mlsa mice, the regulatory effect has been mapped to the Mls locus. The regulatory influence has also been demonstrated in DBA/2 Th cells (Mlsa) stimulated simultaneously with mitogen and Mls-disparate (Mlsb) APC, consistently causing inhibition of mitogen-induced proliferation in this reverse Mls direction. This antagonistic effect has also been linked to the Mls locus. We conclude that the Mls reaction governed by the a and b alleles is bidirectional, producing synergy with class II-dependent activation signals in the direction of Mlsa----Mlsb, and antagonism in the direction Mlsb----Mlsa. Both the classical Mls and the reverse Mls effects have been demonstrated at the clonal level. These results are in accord with the previously proposed hypothesis that the Mls molecule serves as a down-regulatory stimulus in the activation of Th cells. Mls responses of Mlsb T cells are explained as the consequence of a diminished down-regulation by Mlsa APC. Conversely, the reverse Mls response described here can be considered a consequence of inordinately high down-regulation of the Mlsa T cell responses by Mlsb APC.\r"

These lymphoblasts were cloned by limiting dilution and then assayed for binding activity to human thyroglobulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid microsome, and thyroid as well as guinea pig fat cell membranes. Four patients' cells produced antibody that bound to at least one of the Ag; a single clone from one patient that bound equally well to both thyroid and guinea pig fat cell membranes (but not to other thyroid Ag) was selected for further evaluation. Fusion of these cells with SHM-D33 heteromyeloma cells yielded three cell lines that produced genetically identical mAb. Immunostaining of human thyrocytes with this mAb demonstrated an Ag present on both nuclear and cell membranes. This Ag was identified as an 18,000 m.w. protein band on Western blots of both human thyroid and guinea pig fat cell membranes. The mAb was also able to alter thyrocyte physiology as the short term incubation of this mAb with FRTL-5 cells in vitro inhibited thyroid-stimulating hormone-mediated production of cAMP. Thus, this mAb and the Ag it identifies may be relevant to Graves' disease.\r"

Using gel filtration, procion red Sepharose, DEAE, and reverse phase chromatography, we have purified ADF protein to homogeneity from 15 liters of serum-free culture supernatant of an HTLV-I(+) T cell line ATL-2. Purified ADF protein had the m.w. of 14,000 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, and its isoelectric point is around 5.0. ADF did not react with heteroantibodies against IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, which have also IL-2R/Tac-inducing activity on suitable target cells. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of ADF is different from other cytokines such as, IFN, BSF-2, and various IL whose cDNA has been cloned. Western blot analysis using rabbit antibodies against N-terminal 10mer synthetic peptide of ADF showed that IL-1 alpha and ADF are different proteins. ADF had its IL-2R/Tac-inducing activity not only on human NK-like cell line YT, but also on HTLV-I(+) T cells, such as ED. In contrast, macrophage-derived IL-1 lacked IL-2R/Tac-inducing activity on ED cells despite their IL-2R/Tac induction on YT, indicating that ADF and IL-1 have their effect via different receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88187369\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of rIL-4 on the expression of low affinity receptor for the Fc part of IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) and class II MHC antigens on Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines was investigated. Some of the BL lines contained low percentages of CD23 and HLA-DQ-positive cells, but virtually all cells expressed HLA-DR. IL-4 induced CD23 and class II MHC Ag expression on 7 of 9 BL. Optimal CD23 and class II MHC expression was observed after 48-72 h of incubation. Induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag in the BL cell line BL2 by IL-4 was confirmed at the specific mRNA level. Significant activation of HLA-DQ mRNA was obtained after 6 h of incubation with IL-4 and gradually increased during prolonged incubation. Maximal induction of mRNA transcription occurred after 48 to 72 h. Optimal induction of HLA-DR and CD23 transcription in BL2 was also observed after 48 to 72 h. The induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag seems to be specific for IL-4, because rIL-1, rIL-2, rIFN-gamma, recombinant granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, and a commercial source of low m.w. B cell growth factor were ineffective. In addition, the expression of class I MHC Ag, the transferrin receptor, CD38, CD25, CD10, CD20, and CD21 were not affected by IL-4. Interestingly, IFN-gamma and PGE2 suppressed the IL-4-induced membrane expression of CD23 and class II MHC Ag in a dose-dependent way. IFN-gamma also blocked IL-4-induced CD23 mRNA transcription in BL2 completely, whereas PGE2 (10(-7) M) was partially inhibitory. The induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag by IL-4 required intact protein synthesis as shown by its inhibition by cycloheximide. These results indicate that the induction of CD23 and class II MHC Ag by IL-4 is regulated in a coordinated way.\r"

The supernatants did not inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation per se, because they did not suppress mitogen stimulation of spleen cells. Protease digestion of the supernatants removed the suppressive activity, and dialysis studies indicated that the molecular size of the suppressive factor was larger than 50,000 Da and smaller than 100,000 Da. The suppressive activity was stable at 56 degrees C, pH 2, for 1 h. Thus, NS cell clones can be induced to secrete an immunosuppressive lymphokine, NS factor.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of rTNF-alpha on human T cell function was examined and compared with that of rIL-1 beta by assessing the ability of each cytokine to support mitogen-induced proliferation, IL-2 production, and IL-2R expression. TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta each enhanced DNA synthesis induced by PHA or immobilized mAb to the CD3 molecular complex. In addition, each cytokine increased the number of cells entering the G1 phase of the cell cycle and augmented IL-2R expression. The combination of optimal concentrations of these factors supported these responses to a greater extent than either cytokine alone, suggesting that T cell responsiveness is independently regulated by the action of at least two separate monocyte derived cytokines. Whereas TNF-alpha had little effect, IL-1 beta augmented IL-2 mRNA expression and IL-2 production by mitogen-stimulated cells. Furthermore, IL-1 beta enhanced proliferation with increasing length of culture. Whereas TNF-alpha also enhanced proliferation late in culture, it was less effective in this regard than IL-1 beta. Thus, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha augment mitogen-induced T cell proliferation by increasing the number of cells initially activated and by promoting subsequent cell cycle progression. They differ, however, in their capacity to promote IL-2 mRNA and IL-2 production and therefore ongoing T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow cells from C3H/HeJ mice were cultured in recombinant granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF) or recombinant or purified (natural) preparations of macrophage-CSF (CSF-1) for 7 days, the adherent macrophages removed enzymatically, recultured in the absence of growth factor, and examined for their differentiative and functional characteristics. Expression of Ia Ag differed markedly in these two populations. Antibody plus complement-mediated cytotoxicity indicated that the percent of Ia-positive macrophages was low (approximately 15 to 20%) in both populations. Treatment of cultures with rIFN-gamma increased the percentage of Ia-positive cells in both populations; however, more CSF-1-derived macrophages were induced to become Ia positive than rGM-CSF-derived macrophages. In contrast, total Ia expression and Ia density per cell, as measured by ELISA and quantitative immunofluorescence, respectively, showed that medium-treated rGM-CSF-derived macrophages exhibited greater total Ia expression and higher Ia density per cell than CSF-1-derived macrophages. Treatment of CSF-1-derived macrophages with rIFN-gamma increased total Ia expression per culture to the levels exhibited by rGM-CSF-derived cells, although the density of Ia Ag per cell remained lower than in rGM-CSF-derived cells (medium or rIFN-gamma-treated). Northern blot and slot blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNA extracted from freshly harvested rGM-CSF- or CSF-1-derived cells indicated that the differences seen in basal Ia expression were also reflected at the level of steady-state, Ia-specific mRNA. The functional capacity of these two macrophage populations to stimulate Ag-specific T cell proliferation was also assessed. rGM-CSF- or CSF-1-derived macrophages were first cultured in the absence or presence of rIFN-gamma, Ag-pulsed, and irradiated before co-culture with Ag-primed, purified T cells. Ag-induced T cell proliferation was significantly greater in rGM-CSF- than in CSF-1-derived macrophages. Treatment of either population with rIFN-gamma had only a minimal effect on the ability of either macrophage population to stimulate Ag-specific T cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the development of mature macrophages from bone marrow progenitors under the influence of either GM-CSF or CSF-1 may, in part, underlie the functional heterogeneity of different macrophage populations.\r"

This is true of T15 anti-phosphorylcholine (PC) response in which the dominant T15 H (V1, DFL11.6 JH1) and L (VK22, JK5) chain V regions are seldom found associated with the gamma 2b or gamma 2a C regions in the circulation of BALB/c mice. In the present study we describe the characterization of gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and gamma 1 anti-PC antibodies obtained from IgM-producing hybridomas by Ig switching in culture. All switch variants retained the parental T15 idiotype, PC binding, and fine specificity. We thus conclude that the apparent in vivo restriction on the expressed T15 PC binding gamma 2 antibodies is not due to a conformational limitation on the expression of the anti-PC T15 binding site. Further, these studies confirm that in vitro switching can be used to generate mAb that are not readily available in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation injury to blood vessels is associated with an acute inflammatory process. We investigated the capacity of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to produce chemotactic factors after radiation injury. BAEC in serum-free media were irradiated with a cobalt-60 Gammacell 220 and the cell supernatants were assayed for chemotactic activity for human neutrophils in a Boyden chamber. There was a rapid release of chemotactic activity into the BAEC supernatants which was dependent both on the dose of radiation (5 to 40 Gy) and the time between irradiation and sample collection. In contrast, isolation of BAEC lysates by freeze-thawing was not associated with the presence of similar chemotactic activity. The chemotactic activity released from the irradiated BAEC was not destroyed by boiling nor by treatment with trypsin. The release of the chemotactic activity was, however, inhibited by the addition of a lipoxygenase inhibitor but not by the addition of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor before the irradiation. The chemotactic activity was recovered from the cell supernatants in the lipid phase after extraction with chloroform/methanol. Furthermore, the chloroform/methanol extracts co-eluted with authentic leukotriene B4 when the BAEC were prelabeled with [14C] arachidonic acid. However, we were unable to detect endogenous leukotriene B4 with RIA. Instead, the only detectable endogenous lipid present in the supernatants was 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid which is derived from linoleic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway. 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, however, had no chemotactic activity. These findings suggest that endothelial cells rapidly release a chemotactic agent after irradiation, the release of which is associated with a lipoxygenase pathway. The release of this chemotactic activity may account in part for the acute inflammatory response that is observed after ionizing irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Because products of arachidonic acid metabolism, particularly the PG, have been implicated as modulators of growth and differentiation of adult thymocytes, we investigated relations between metabolism of arachidonic acid and growth, as well as differentiation, of thymocytes during fetal thymic organ culture. Fetal thymic cells synthesized immunoreactive PGE2 during organ culture and were found to be capable of metabolizing exogenous arachidonic acid to products that cochromatographed with authentic 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, PGF2 alpha. Synthesis of these products and growth and expression of Thy-1 and Lyt-1 Ag were inhibited by culture of fetal thymic lobes with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, as well as meclofenamate and eicosatetraynoic acid, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. Only indomethacin inhibited expression of Lyt-2. Culture with eicosatetraynoic acid also inhibited the capacity of thymic lobes to synthesize 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-like products. The inhibitory effects of indomethacin on growth and expression of Thy-1 were partially reversed by simultaneous addition of arachidonic acid. Thus, fetal thymic cells appear to require an intact cyclooxygenase, and possibly lipoxygenase, pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism for growth and differentiation. These data also provide evidence that Lyt-1 and Lyt-2 may be regulated by different requirements with respect to arachidonic acid metabolism.\r"

The data showed that six Ag: 202, 165, 90 to 92, 85, 72, and 37 kDa are the principal targets on the larva of IgG in the sera of resistant subjects. The comparative study, by immunoblotting and ELISA on purified Ag, of the sera from high and low susceptibility subjects indicates that IgG reactivity toward the 37-kDa Ag may be associated with resistance. This work and ongoing vaccination trials carried out in mice suggest that the 37-kDa Ag may have vaccinating potentials.\r"

  ".W": "Mice can be partially protected against challenge infections of Schistosoma mansoni cercariae by either single or multiple exposure to irradiated cercariae (x-cerc). The participation of L3T4+ lymphocytes on this resistance phenomenon was evaluated by selectively depleting this cell population through in vivo administration of mAb anti-L3T4 (hybridoma GK 1.5) at three different times in relationship to the challenge infections. Treatment with anti-L3T4 before challenge such that depletion was effective during the time of cercarial skin penetration and dermal/s.c. residence significantly reduced the level of resistance induced by x-cerc sensitization. When treatment was delayed until after challenge, depletion of L3T4+ cells coincided with either the lung or post-lung/liver phases of schistosomular migration, and normal levels of x-cerc-induced resistance were induced. In contrast to once-immunized mice, mice hyperimmunized by five exposures to x-cerc and then depleted of L3T4+ cells at the time of challenge (skin phase) still expressed resistance to the challenge. These data suggest that when mice are sensitized only once with x-cerc the challenge infection provides a necessary immunologic boost which requires L3T4+ cells for effective expression of resistance. The requirement for this anamnestic effect by the challenge infection can be circumvented by hyperimmunization. Evaluation of the immune response of one-time sensitized or hyperimmunized mice demonstrated that cellular Ag-specific proliferative responses and mitogen-induced lymphokine production were abrogated after any of the various in vivo regimens of anti-L3T4 antibody. In contrast, immunoblot analysis of humoral responsiveness revealed a correlation between the expression of resistance and the ability of sera from immunized and anti-L3T4 treated mice to recognize a 75-kDa parasite antigenic component.\r"

T cell immunity can be generated by immunizing mice with 10 micrograms of P. aeruginosa polysaccharide (PS) plus the antimitotic agent vinblastine sulfate. Vinblastine is required to inactivate a population of Ts cells generated by immunization with 10 micrograms of PS alone. Immunization with either live bacteria or with higher dose (50 micrograms) of PS without vinblastine also generates T cell immunity; these protocols activate a population of Lyt-1+, 2-, I-J+ T cells which, like vinblastine, counteract the effect of Ts cells. Immunization with 10 micrograms PS alone fails to activate this T cell subpopulation. When administered at the time of immunization, this subpopulation can render the tolerogenic 10-micrograms immunization protocols immunogenic. Like previously described contrasuppressor T cells, this T cell subpopulation exhibits an affinity for the lectin Vicia villosa. We have determined, however, that the T cells that act as contrasuppressor cells in this system are directly activated by PS-immune B cells and not by PS Ag. Furthermore, their activity can be removed by adsorption to PS-specific B cell hybridomas. Our studies indicate an important role for B cells in the development of T cell immunity to P. aeruginosa and suggest that a complex idiotype network controls the development of this response.\r"

Treatment with i.p. immunization was somewhat less effective, whereas i.m. vaccination failed to elicit protective immunity. The level of resistance induced by intradermal immunization was influenced by the strain of BCG used, and isolated BCG cell walls did not reliably substitute for whole BCG organisms as adjuvant. Bordetella pertussis vaccine and saponin were also able to function as adjuvants for protective immunity in this model, whereas other immunopotentiators including Corynebacterium parvum and aluminum hydroxide were ineffective. No correlation between resistance to challenge infection and antibody levels was detected. Animals immunized intradermally using either protective or non-protective adjuvants all showed minimal humoral reactivity against schistosomulum surface Ag but strong IgG response to soluble parasite components including paramyosin, which is the major serologically recognized Ag in mice vaccinated intradermally with schistosome Ag plus BCG and is protective in this model. In contrast, a strong correlation was observed between resistance and Ag-specific cell-mediated reactivity, including IFN production by T lymphocytes in vitro and macrophage activation in vivo. These results further substantiate the hypothesis that protection in this model is based on cell-mediated immune effector mechanisms. Moreover, they may be of general relevance in the design of vaccination protocols using other Ag or against other infectious agents.\r"

It was also found that six of the hybridomas bound to soluble egg Ag and were therefore anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). Ab3 were shown to be inhibited from binding to soluble egg Ag by Ab2.

  ".U": "88187390\r", 
  ".W": "Mice infected with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human Chagas' disease, are profoundly immunodepressed in their response to various Ag and mitogens. A key factor in this immunosuppression is the essential inability to produce the T cell growth factor IL-2. In this study we demonstrate that this failure to produce IL-2 in response to mitogen stimulation is not the result of the absence of production of soluble or membrane-bound IL-1 by macrophages. Limiting dilution analysis of the precursor frequency of IL-2 producers suggests that an adequate number of precursors for IL-2 production are present in the spleens of infected mice, but that their activity may be regulated by suppressor cells. The presence of precursor cells for IL-2 production is supported by experiments showing that the combination of calcium ionophores and PMA elicits IL-2 production by spleen cells from both normal and T. cruzi-infected mice. Although Con A can provide either of the signals necessary for IL-2 production, calcium flux or protein kinase C activation, to T cells from normal mice, Con A in combination with either calcium ionophore or phorbol ester failed to activate T cells from infected mice to produce IL-2. Preculture of spleen cells from infected mice for 48 to 72 h before addition of Con A results in near normal production of IL-2. This recovery of the capacity to produce IL-2 does not occur if parasite Ag is present during the preculture period. These results suggest that the inability of T cells from T. cruzi-infected mice to produce IL-2 in vitro in response to Con A is not due to the lack of IL-2-producing cells, but may be the result of the maturational state of the T cells or to the presence of a suppressor population.\r"

  ".W": "Suppression of IL-2 production during experimental Chagas' disease accounts at least in part for the overall depressed state of the immune system in infected mice. The failure to produce IL-2 in response to mitogen stimulation is not the result of the lack of cells capable of producing IL-2, but appears to be due to regulation of IL-2 production by suppressor cells. This conclusion is supported by cell-mixing experiments where the ability of cells from infected mice to suppress normal spleen cell IL-2 production is evident. Although depletion of plastic and Sephadex G-10 adherent cells results in modest increases in IL-2 production by spleen cells from infected mice, even in the presence of normal adherent cells as a source of IL-1 producers, IL-2 production does not approach normal levels. Also, isolated macrophages are not by themselves suppressive for normal spleen cell IL-2 production, whereas plastic and G-10 nonadherent cells from infected mice are. Depletion of Thy-1+ and Ly-2+ cells not only completely abrogates the ability of spleen cells from infected mice to suppress normal IL-2 production, but results in a cell preparation which actually enhances IL-2 production. Anti-Ly-2 and C treatment of infected spleen cells also markedly enhances their ability to produce IL-2. These results indicate a major role for Ts cells in the regulation of IL-2 production, and a relatively minor role of macrophages as direct effector cells of suppression in this response. The ability to enhance IL-2 production in this system with PG synthesis inhibitors suggests a role for PG-producing cells such as macrophages in the suppressor mechanism, perhaps as inducers of the suppressor effector cells.\r"

PuM treated overnight with IFN (1000 U/ml), Con A-stimulated spleen cell culture supernatants, or lymph node cells plus Con A significantly killed yeast cells of the Gar w isolate of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis 45.5 +/- 2.1%, 72.0 +/- 4.2%, and 51.5 +/- 0.7% respectively. Two other isolates of P. brasiliensis (Ru and LA) were also killed (45 and 34%) by PuM activated by lymph node cells plus Con A. Control PuM had lesser but significant capacity for killing of P. brasiliensis isolates, ranging from 15 to 22%. Killing of P. brasiliensis by PuM activated by Con A-stimulated spleen cell culture supernatants could not be significantly inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or azide. When mice were treated in vivo with 4 X 10(5) IFN U i.p. and PuM isolated 24 h later, the PuM had significantly enhanced ability to kill P. brasiliensis (47.0 +/- 6.3%) compared with PuM from control mice (25.0 +/- 4.2%). PuM thus activated also showed enhanced killing (43%) of a second isolate compared with control PuM (22%). PuM from IFN-treated mice were able to significantly kill Blastomyces dermatitidis (37.5 +/- 0.7%) compared with control PuM (4.5 +/- 6.3%). These results show that PuM can be activated in vitro and in vivo by IFN for enhanced fungicidal activity against two pulmonary fungal pathogens and suggests that immunologic production of IFN could be an important factor in host defenses against these diseases.\r"

There were three major findings from these studies. 1) Amnion cells frequently expressed class I HLA. Three mAb to monomorphic determinants of class I HLA were used: 61D2, PA2.6, and W6/32. 61D2 identified 1 of 8 fresh amnion membranes as class I positive whereas PA2.6 identified 4/8 and W6/32 identified 5/8. 2) Amnion cells contained class I HLA mRNA. RNA extracted from amnion membranes hybridized to a class I HLA probe (pHLA1.1) in Northern blotting. In situ hybridization procedures with pHLA1.1 showed that essentially all amnion cells contained class I HLA mRNA. 3) Levels of class I HLA mRNA in amnion cells could be modulated. Exposure of amnion explants to medium containing IFN-gamma enhanced levels of class I HLA mRNA in amnion cells, whereas epidermal growth factor diminished those levels. The results suggest that amnion cells transcribe class I HLA genes and are capable of synthesizing class I H chains but that expression may be modulated by extrinsic regulatory molecules.\r"

Another BALB/c mouse thymoma-derived T cell line, CAK1.3 (Thy-1+, L3T4+, Lyt-2+), synthesized a high level of TCR-alpha as well as TCR-beta mRNA but did not produce any amount of TCR-gamma mRNA. HAT-sensitive clones were established from the two T cell lines. Azaguanine-resistant, HPRT- CAK4.4 cells and bromodeoxyuridine-resistant, TK- CAK1.3 cells were fused by electrofusion method and the resultant hybrids were analyzed for expression of TCR genes as well as the changes of their cell surface phenotypes. Transcription of TCR-gamma gene was completely suppressed in all hybrids tested, although Southern blot analysis showed that the hybrids maintained TCR-gamma chain genes derived from both parental cells. TCR-alpha gene transcription occurred normally in one hybrid. In two other hybrids, TCR-alpha gene transcription was strongly suppressed. Treatment of the hybrid cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate reversed the suppression of TCR-alpha gene transcription, but TCR-gamma gene transcription was not recovered by the same treatment. However, transcription level of TCR-beta gene was not changed in all hybrids. Our results suggested that the different trans-acting regulatory mechanisms control the transcription levels of TCR-alpha and TCR-gamma genes and that such a transcriptional control may play a crucial role in the determination of orderly appearance of TCR-gamma and TCR-alpha gene products during T cell ontogeny in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Newly formed B cells first express IgM and subsequently display IgD on the cell surface. This is an ontologically, as well as developmentally, regulated process because IgD is virtually absent on neonatal splenic B cells. In the present studies we have examined, by means of nascent RNA chain labeling, the relative levels of mu to delta gene transcription in bone marrow B cells, pre-B cells, and earlier progenitors of B cells. Pre-B cells were obtained from Whitlock-type long term cultures of bone marrow cells from normal and C.B17 scid mice. Both populations were found to transcribe the delta gene at very low but detectable levels. A similarly low level of delta transcription was found to occur in surface IgM-positive cells from both cultured and freshly isolated bone marrow B cells. In all populations analyzed, termination of the majority of polymerases occurred within a discrete 1-kb region located between the microM and C delta I exons. Analysis of steady state RNA indicated that long term cultured bone marrow cells from normal mice produced both 2.7-kb normal sized microM mRNA as well as 2.9-kb aberrantly spliced I mu-mRNA, whereas those from C.B17 scid mice contained only aberrant sized mu-mRNA. In contrast to these results, our previous findings with spleen cells obtained from both neonatal and adult animals showed that delta gene transcription occurs at a relatively high level. Therefore, it is possible that activation of regulatory signals that allow polymerases to progress beyond the termination site 3' of the microM exons may occur when newly formed B cells migrate from the bone marrow to the splenic environment.\r"

  ".U": "88187400\r", 
  ".W": "Cell-surface murine T200 glycoprotein has been implicated in the binding of NK cells to certain susceptible tumor targets. The existence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures on T200 glycoprotein and the ability of lactosamine-type oligosaccharides to inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity suggest that these structures may also be important in NK-target binding. To further identify and characterize these structures, relevant saccharides and reconstituted membrane liposomes containing fractionated effector cell membrane proteins were tested for their ability to block conjugate formation. Under base line conditions, the majority of plastic-non-adherent, Percoll-fractionated, NK-enriched splenocytes that formed conjugates with NK-susceptible YAC-1 targets functioned as lytic effectors in a single-cell cytotoxicity assay. These effectors were blocked in their ability to bind to YAC-1 targets by the addition of N-acetyllactosamine [Gal(beta 1,4)-GlcNAc] and chitobiose [GlcNAc(beta 1,4)GlcNAc], but not by saccharides lacking lactosamine-type linkages. Liposomes prepared from octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside-extracted YAC-1 and NK-enriched effector cell membranes interfered with conjugate formation, whereas liposomes prepared from NK-insensitive P815 cells were inconsequential. Surface radiolabeled effector cell membrane proteins were fractionated by tomato lectin-Sepharose 4B (poly-N-acetyllactosamine-specific) column chromatography. Tomato lectin-bound material was enriched in a glycoprotein identical with T200, which, when incorporated into liposomes, was a potent inhibitor of effector-target binding. This inhibitory capacity was abrogated by treatment of liposomes with Ly-5 mAb (T200 mAb) or the lactosamine-specific enzyme endo-beta-galactosidase. When T200 was purified by mAb affinity chromatography and incorporated into liposomes, it was a potent inhibitor of conjugate formation, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment of T200-containing liposomes with Ly-5 mAb or endo-beta-galactosidase. These data provide additional evidence that T200 can mediate binding of NK cells to YAC-1 targets, and that poly-N-acetyllactosamine-type structures on NK cell surface T200 glycoprotein are important in the binding process.\r"

In comparison with treatment with either agent alone, the combination of 1.B6 and rIFN-gamma was associated with a dramatic increase in long term survival. No direct effects of rIFN-gamma on tumor cell proliferation, MHC Ag expression, or susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis could be demonstrated to explain the prolongation of survival. However, rIFN-gamma induced a distinct increase in broad-spectrum cytolytic capacity of peritoneal exudate cells and further increased class II MHC expression on peritoneal macrophages. The explanation for enhanced adoptive chemoimmunotherapy after combined short term administration of a CTL clone and rIFN-gamma is uncertain. Potential mechanisms include direct tumor lysis by activated cells, indirect tumor lysis via sensitization to other lymphokines or monokines, improved Ag-specific activation of transferred CTL clones, and/or more effective development of de novo host anti-tumor immunity.\r"

The symptoms reported were not statistically associated with any organism isolated, and clinical signs of pharyngitis were associated only with the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Based on these results, management of pharyngitis in children should continue to be based on the detection and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.\r"

Hormone determinations, sperm analyses, measurements of basal body temperature, and interviews with a standardized questionnaire were used for diagnostic evaluation. Elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and azoospermia were seen in all male patients after completion of induction and consolidation therapy as a result of germ cell and stem cell loss. Recovery of spermatogenesis, as indicated by normalization of serum FSH values and sperm density, occurred in the second year of maintenance therapy in all men. Serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) values remained within normal limits indicating resistance of Leydig cells to chemotherapy. All female patients showed normal serum levels of gonadal steroids and gonadotropins, as well as an adequate increase in basal body temperature after intensified chemotherapy, indicating intact follicle function and ovulation. Most patients reported normal sexual functions after induction and consolidation therapy. These results demonstrate that multidrug chemotherapy induced significant impairment of reproductive function in all male patients with early and complete recovery. In contrast, endocrine gonadal function was unaffected in men treated with ALL/AUL. In female patients, neither reproductive nor endocrine functions were influenced by aggressive chemotherapy.\r"

Previous reports have suggested that interferons can be safely administered by the intraperitoneal (IP) route with a pharmacokinetic advantage for peritoneal cavity exposure compared with the systemic circulation and with objective antitumor activity being demonstrated. On the basis of these reports and laboratory data suggesting activity for recombinant gamma-interferon (r-GIFN) against several malignant cell lines, we treated 27 refractory ovarian carcinoma patients, including six with very-small-volume residual disease, with this agent delivered by the IP route. While r-GIFN was found to be remarkably well tolerated, with a 150- to 200-fold pharmacokinetic advantage for peak levels achieved in the peritoneal cavity compared with the plasma, no objective responses were observed. Despite the lack of demonstrated activity for single-agent IP-administered r-GIFN in this clinical setting, there remains considerable interest in this agent when delivered by the IP route because of in vitro data suggesting concentration-dependent synergy between r-GIFN and other biological agents.\r"

Dietary 18:3n-3 at a ratio of 0.28 (n-3 to n-6 fatty acids) suppressed levels of 20:4n-6 in lung and plasma phospholipids and the capacity of the tissues to synthesize cyclooxygenase-derived products in a dose-dependent fashion. At similar ratios of n-3 to n-6 dietary fatty acids, longer-chain n-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fish oil, appear to be more effective than 18:3n-3 in suppressing 20:4n-6 levels and the capacity of the tissues to synthesize cyclooxygenase-derived products. Much greater amounts of 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) and 5-HEPE than of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 5-HETE appeared to be formed in tissues of the group receiving the highest amount of fish oil.

Increased detection of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding and dietary hemoglobin may reduce HemoQuant's specificity in the screening setting. The authors performed a cost effectiveness analysis comparing Hemoccult and HemoQuant for colorectal cancer screening using assumptions based on probabilities and costs in the current literature, varying the specificity of HemoQuant. The analysis showed the marginal cost effectiveness of Hemoccult versus no test to be $43,000, and HemoQuant versus Hemoccult to be $296,000 if HemoQuant specificity is 0.95. The marginal cost effectiveness ratio increased to $601,000 if three HemoQuant tests were used. Survival benefit was small and highly dependent on Hemoccult sensitivity and mortality from colonoscopy if HemoQuant specificity was less than 0.9. The authors conclude that unless the high sensitivity reported for HemoQuant is accompanied by a specificity comparable to that of Hemoccult, HemoQuant may not be an acceptable alternative for colorectal cancer screening.\r"

  ".W": "The simian virus 40 (SV40) transcriptional enhancer is composed of multiple cis-acting DNA sequence motifs, each individually having a two- to fourfold effect on the efficiency of transcription. When various distinct cis-elements act in combination, however, a dramatic enhancement of transcription initiation often results. SV40-enhancer A-domain sequences were previously shown to be important for early and late transcription in vivo. Here we report the isolation of the enhancer binding factor AP-4, which recognizes a motif in this domain. Purified AP-4 activates SV40 late transcription in vitro, and this stimulation is augmented by the addition of transcription factor AP-1 which binds to adjacent sequences in the A-domain, suggesting coordinate action of the two factors for transcriptional enhancement. AP-1 also represses late transcription from a major in vitro start site which is poorly used in vivo, indicating that AP-1 can act as both a positive and negative regulator of SV40 late transcription. Thus by manipulating the levels of different trans-acting factors in vitro, we can recreate the pattern of SV40 late initiation observed during the viral lytic cycle in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "88189293\r", 
  ".W": "Transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeasts to mammals has many common features such as enhancer elements, TATA elements, and activator proteins that bind specifically to promoter DNA. The JUN oncoprotein, which causes sarcomas in chickens, shows significant homology to the DNA-binding domain of GCN4, a yeast protein that stimulates transcription of the amino acid biosynthetic genes. The GCN4 and JUN proteins bind the same DNA sequences, consensus ATGA(C/G)TCAT, even though the DNA-binding domains are only 45% identical in amino acid sequence. The JUN protein almost certainly represents the oncogenic version of the normal AP-1 transcription factor, suggesting an evolutionary relationship between yeast and vertebrate activator proteins. Here, I demonstrate that JUN efficiently activates transcription in yeast either through its own or a heterologous DNA-binding domain. As is the case for yeast activator proteins, transcriptional stimulation by JUN requires an acidic activation region distinct from the DNA-binding domain. The functional interchangeability between yeast and vertebrate transcription factors strongly suggests a basic similarity in the molecular mechanism of eukaryotic transcriptional activation.\r"

  ".W": "The I region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the mouse (H-2) contains a tightly-linked cluster of highly polymorphic genes (class II MHC genes) which control immune responsiveness. Speculation on the origin of this polymorphism, which is believed to be essential for the function of the class II proteins in immune responses to disease, has given rise to two hypotheses. The first is that hypermutational mechanisms (gene conversion or segmental exchange) promote the rapid generation of diversity in MHC genes. The alternative is that polymorphism has arisen from the steady accumulation of mutations over long evolutionary periods, and multiple specific alleles have survived speciation (trans-species evolution). We have looked for evidence of 'segmental exchange' and/or 'trans-species evolution' in the class II genes of the genus Mus by molecular genetic analysis of I-A beta alleles. The results indicate that greater than 90% (28 out of 31) of the alleles examined can be organized into two evolutionary groups both on the basis of restriction site polymorphisms and by the presence or absence of a short interspersed nucleotide element (SINE). Using this SINE sequence as an evolutionary tag, we demonstrate that I-A beta alleles in these two evolutionary groups diverged at least three million years ago and have survived the speciation events leading to several modern Mus species. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of eight Mus m. domesticus I-A beta alleles representing all three evolutionary groups indicate that most of the divergence in exon sequences is due to the steady accumulation of mutations that are maintained independently in the different alleles. But segmental exchanges between alleles from different evolutionary groups have also played a role in the diversification of beta 1 exons.\r"

The recent cloning of the Shaker locus from Drosophila melanogaster has provided a starting point for molecular studies of potassium channels. Predicted Shaker proteins appear to be integral membrane proteins and have a sequence similar to the sequence of the S4 segment of the vertebrate sodium channel, where the S4 segment has been proposed to be the voltage sensor. Expression studies in frog oocytes confirm that Shaker encodes a component of a potassium channel (the A channel) that conducts a fast transient potassium current. Here we report the isolation of complementary DNA clones from the mouse brain, the nucleotide sequences of which predict a protein remarkably similar to the Shaker protein. The strong conservation of the predicted protein sequence in flies and mammals suggests that these mouse clones encode a potassium channel component and that the conserved amino acids may be essential to some aspect of potassium channel function.\r"

This activation requires two functions of the protein: a DNA binding domain located near the amino terminus, and one or more 'activating regions'. The 'activating regions' are highly acidic (see also ref. 12) and can be replaced, for example, by a short peptide designed to form a negatively charged, amphipathic alpha-helix. GAL4, as well as deletion derivatives bearing one or more 'activating regions' attached to the DNA binding domain, activates transcription in cultured mammalian cells from mammalian promoters linked to a UASG (refs 14, 15). Here we show that GAL4, when expressed in particular tissues of Drosophila larvae, stimulates tissue-specific transcription of a Drosophila promoter linked to GAL4 binding sites.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of some genes is known to be a periodic function of the amount of DNA between the binding sites of its regulatory proteins. The period observed is close to 10.5 base pairs (bp), that is, one turn of the B form of the DNA helix. Such periodicity is also seen in the cooperative binding of phage lambda and lac repressors. These periodic phenomena have been attributed to a requirement for a unique rotational alignment in forming essential contacts between the bound proteins. Here we report a strong periodic dependence of the transcription of a cloned Drosophila melanogaster heat shock gene on the amount of DNA inserted between its two heat shock consensus elements. In addition, we find a similar periodicity for insertions just 3' to the proximal heat shock element. Consistent with the torsional flexibility of DNA, these periodic effects are seen for short insertions, up to approximately 80 bp, but not for much longer ones. We conclude that maximal transcription requires rotationally unique contacts between proteins bound to the two heat shock elements and also requires correct alignment of additional sites of DNA-protein binding downstream of the proximal element.\r"

When it occurs after the immediate postoperative period, otorrhea is probably the result of external contamination of the middle ear or acute otitis media. We analyzed data from 627 operations upon 1248 ears of 491 children with chronic secretory otitis media and found that delayed onset (longer than 7 weeks) postoperative otorrhea occurred after 26.4 percent of the 382 operations in which tympanostomy tubes were used. The average number of episodes of otorrhea per case was 1.46 and ranged from 1 to 9. The rate of otorrhea occurrence in patients with tubes in place was significantly higher in the summer months. Otorrhea also occurred after 9.0 percent of 245 myringotomy procedures. The average number of episodes was 1.32 and ranged from 1 to 3. Treatment of postoperative otorrhea increases the health care costs of surgical treatment of chronic otitis media with effusion; this problem should be included in the calculation of cost-effectiveness.\r"

Ipsilateral stimulation of the olfactory bulb produced excitation in 31% of olfactory tubercle neurons tested and inhibition in 17%. Twenty-two percent of the olfactory tubercle neurons were excited, whereas 9% were inhibited by ipsilateral stimulation of the locus ceruleus. Contralateral stimulation of the locus ceruleus produced similar responses in the same neuron entities. A negative-positive evoked potential was recorded in the olfactory tubercle after ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation of the locus ceruleus. Thirty-three percent of the olfactory tubercle neurons that responded orthodromically or antidromically to stimulation of the olfactory bulb were excited by ipsilateral stimulation of the locus ceruleus. In contrast, only 10% responded with excitation to ipsilateral stimulation of the locus ceruleus among the olfactory tubercle neurons that were unresponsive to stimulation of the olfactory bulb. These findings suggest that olfactory tubercle neurons that receive input from or sending output to the olfactory bulb are influenced by the noradrenergic system of the locus ceruleus. A possible role of the olfactory tubercle in olfactory transduction will also be discussed.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess vocal characteristics of patients with glottic carcinoma after they had undergone radiation therapy. Twenty males, who had previously been treated with external beam irradiation for T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma with no subsequent evidence of recurrence, volunteered for this study. Laryngovideostroboscopic, acoustic, aerodynamic, and perceptual measures of vocal function were used to determine the characteristics of voice production. Acoustic indices were compared to those of a normal group of 30 age-matched volunteers, and the other measures were compared to established values reported in the literature. On acoustic analysis, the study group was characterized by significantly worse voice production than their counterparts. A high degree of intersubject variability was noted that could not be accounted for in terms of variables in treatment and medical history. The aerodynamic, spectral, and video-stroboscopic findings correlated well; this indicated a poor vibratory source, characterized by diffuse stiffness. Further work is necessary in order to compare vocal function after endoscopic laser and conventional conservative excision.\r"

A biphasic evoked potential could be identified within 3 milliseconds of stimulation with the use of a signal-averaging computer. This potential remained when the animal was paralyzed and disappeared when the facial nerve was cut proximal to the stimulation site. A potential of similar latency and duration but larger amplitude was recorded from the subarachnoid space. Mapping studies indicated its origin to be a dipole located between ipsilateral mastoid and parietal recording sites that corresponded to the region of the intracranial facial nerve. Optimal stimulation and recording techniques for subsequent studies of human beings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The singular canal transmits the posterior ampullary nerve between the inferior part of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal. The anatomy of the singular canal was studied in temporal bone dissections, in surgical dissections, and in high-resolution computerized tomography scans. Measurements were taken for distances between the origin of the singular canal in the IAC, the porus acousticus, the vestibule, and posterior canal ampulla. The location and importance of the singular canal are demonstrated for retrosigmoid-IAC vestibular neurectomy, retrosigmoid acoustic neuroma surgery, and transcochlear cochleovestibular neurectomy. The main purpose for the use of the retrosigmoid approach to the internal auditory canal during vestibular neurectomy and excision of acoustic neuromas is preservation of hearing. A major concern when the contents of the internal auditory canal are exposed through this approach is fenestration of the labyrinth, which results in sensorineural hearing loss. In the retrosigmoid approach, the singular canal has been found to be a vital landmark in prevention of fenestration during surgery of the internal auditory canal.\r"

The pathophysiology probably involves vascular obstruction in the venules. Specific changes in the microvasculature are presumed to be comparable to those that occur with hyperviscosity disorders in the retina. Maintenance of a normal blood viscosity will prevent damage to the ear, as well as other organs. Additionally, reduction of the blood viscosity can greatly improve otologic symptoms. Case studies and a review of the pertinent literature are included.\r"

We have recently managed a patient who was not a candidate for surgery, with a catecholamine-secreting glomus jugulare tumor. After 4750 rad of radiation therapy, no changes in tumor size or in catecholamine secretion have been observed (at 20 months of followup). The implications of the case are discussed.\r"

Fifty consecutive patients who underwent composite resections and were reconstructed by split-thickness skin grafts were analyzed. Factors examined included: number of blood units transfused, disease status vs. stage, length of hospital stay, complications, use of prosthetic devices for aiding in swallowing and speech production, and patient diet at discharge. This evaluation and literature review revealed that the amount of tissue resection was considered to be the most significant functional determinant, followed by maintenance of residual tissue mobility. The use of a split-thickness skin graft was believed to give excellent results for the previously mentioned parameters and is our preferred method for reconstruction of composite resection defects that do not require tissue bulk as in anterior mandible defects, anticipated mandible reconstruction, total or near-total glossectomy, or very massive defects.\r"

The incidence of detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to all three study antibiotics increased with therapy.

This study evaluated the short-term efficacy of oral terfenadine (Seldane) in the treatment of the common cold. Over a 5-week period, the authors recruited 250 adults who had developed cold symptoms within 6 to 48 hours prior to enrollment. Volunteers had a primary complaint of runny or stuffy nose; at least one other respiratory symptom; no fever or exudative pharyngitis; and no history of atopy, sinusitis, or use of cold preparations within 1 week of enrollment. Out of the eligible subjects, 126 were randomly assigned terfenadine (60 mg), and 124 received placebo. Volunteers self-administered either terfenadine or placebo twice a day on Days 1, 2 and 3, and a final dose on the morning of Day 4. They also recorded the severity of their clinical symptoms (runny nose, sniffles, sneezing, postnasal drip, cough and sore throat) on symptom cards. Both groups reported similar severity scores throughout the treatment period. Average symptom burdens declined at almost identical rates for both groups. Terfenadine was well tolerated and had a low incidence of side effects. According to subject evaluation, terfenadine was no more effective than placebo. The mean +/- SD score of global efficacy was 2.2 +/- 1.1 in the terfenadine group and 2.1 +/- 1.3 in the placebo group (P = NS). Slightly fewer terfenadine recipients (41%) than placebo recipients (48%) said they would use the study medication again for treating cold symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report on a white boy, initially seen at 4.3 years of age and observed for 4 years, who has short stature caused by the excess thyroxine binding. At his initial examination his thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels were elevated (17 mg/dL), and he had a T4 level of 25.8 micrograms/dL, short stature, a bone age of 19 months, normal vital signs, and hyperthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) testing (maximal value 58 microIU/mL). Results of tests obtained during the next 6 months showed other abnormalities related to thyroid function. Tests showed the following values: T3 412 ng/dL, thyroid uptake 24%, and low T3 resin uptake. They also showed these values: an elevated basal TSH of 8.7 microIU/mL, a slightly low preejection period to left ventricular ejection time ratio of 0.29 (normal 0.35 +/- 0.04), and WISC-R IQ within normal limits. Because of the persistent short stature, T3 supplementation was started at age 7 years and gradually increased to 35 micrograms/d. The patient showed no thyrotoxic symptoms. Serum T4 level decreased from 25.8 to 4.2 micrograms/dL, T3 increased to 1,240 ng/dL, the TRH/TSH test result was suppressed (maximal level 1.8), and the preejection period to left ventricular ejection time ratio decreased to 0.24. Growth velocity increased by 65%. Both of the child's parents had normal thyroid test results. A younger brother also showed similar elevations of TBG level and even greater T4 values (36 micrograms/dL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been widely assumed that theoretical correction of TcPCO2 (combining temperature correction with a constant metabolic factor of 4 mm Hg) accounts for the elevation of TcPCO2 over PaCO2. To test this assumption, TcPCO2 was measured with a 44 degrees C electrode and compared to PaCO2 in 60 normotensive infants with cardiorespiratory disease during the first four +/- six days of life (mean +/- SD) (range one to 36 days). During hypocapnea, from PaCO2. In contrast, during normocapnea, theoretically corrected TcPCO2 exceeded PaCO2 by 5 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than .001), and similarly during hypercapnea, theoretically corrected TcPCO2 exceeded PaCO2 by 9 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than .001). These data suggest that, as PaCO2 increases, there may be an imbalance between tissue CO2 production and removal, resulting in a progressively increasing gradient between TcPCO2 and PaCO2. Clarification of the relationship between TcPCO2 and PaCO2 should enhance the interpretation of TcPCO2 measurements in infants.\r"

Proteolytic cleavage is required for activation and may be responsible for inactivation of cofactor activity. To identify which of the multiple cleavages are required for activation and inactivation of factor VIII, site-directed DNA-mediated mutagenesis of the factor VIII cDNA was performed and the altered forms of factor VIII were expressed in COS-1 monkey cells and characterized. Conversion of arginine residues to isoleucine residues at the aminoterminal side of the cleavage sites at positions 740, 1648, and 1721 resulted in cleavage resistance at the modified site with no alteration in the in vitro procoagulant activity and the susceptibility to thrombin activation. Similar modification of the thrombin cleavage sites at either position 372 or position 1689 resulted in molecules with residual factor VIII activity but resistant to thrombin cleavage at the modified site and not susceptible to thrombin activation. Modification of the arginine to either an isoleucine or a lysine at residue 336, the site postulated for proteolytic inactivation by activated protein C, resulted in a factor VIII molecule with increased procoagulant activity. This increased activity may result from greater resistance to proteolytic inactivation. A model for the activation and inactivation of factor VIII is proposed.\r"

To elucidate the basis for this control, we analyzed the expression of altered forms of the mu transcription unit. Deletion of intron sequence between the microseconds and micro m exons, which reduces the distance between the two poly(A) sites as well as the distance between micro m splice sites, enhances production of micro m RNA. Correct expression is restored by insertion of heterologous sequences, demonstrating that spacing is indeed the critical aspect. The altered spacing appears to affect poly(A) site usage rather than splice site usage, since it was the distance between the poly(A) sites rather than the distance between splice sites that was found to be decisive. Finally, removal of either the C mu 4 splice donor or the m1 splice acceptor, thus eliminating normal micro m splicing, does not increase usage of the microseconds poly(A) site. We therefore conclude that the major factor in determining the ratio of microseconds to micro m is a poly(A) site choice rather than a splicing choice.\r"

  ".W": "The RAS2 gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressed in Escherichia coli was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro to approximately 0.5-0.7 mol of phosphate per mol of protein. Neither protein kinase C nor protein kinase P phosphorylated the RAS2 protein significantly. The RAS2 protein is known to activate, in the presence of either Mg2+ and GTP or Mn2+, a yeast membrane preparation with an overexpressed adenylyl cyclase and a deficiency in endogenous RAS1 and RAS2 proteins. When the RAS2 protein was phosphorylated by protein kinase A prior to exposure to the yeast membranes, its capacity to activate the adenylyl cyclase was diminished by 40-60%, while activation by Mn2+ remained unaffected. The phosphorylated protein retained, however, its ability to bind GTP. Incubation of protein kinase A with a specific protein kinase A inhibitor prior to phosphorylation prevented the inhibition. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of GTP was not required for the observed inhibition. These data suggest that phosphorylation of the RAS2 gene product by protein kinase A may function as one mechanism by which the intracellular level of cAMP in yeast is regulated.\r"

In the presence of NusA, one of several host factors implicated in antitermination, N is found to virtually abolish termination at tR'. N is unable to suppress termination if the terminator is preceded by a defective nut site. Thus, during transcription through the nut site, N and NusA can modify RNA polymerase to a termination-resistant form in the absence of any other accessory factor.\r"

The CT treatment increased intracellular cAMP levels, but neither enhanced nor inhibited antigen-induced histamine release or arachidonate release. The same treatment of the sensitized bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells with CT markedly enhanced thrombin-induced histamine release without affecting arachidonate release. The CT treatment failed to affect antigen-induced and thrombin-induced generation of inositol trisphosphate and of diacylglycerol or mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The results indicate that Gs in bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells is not involved in the transduction of the antigen-induced or thrombin-induced triggering signal to phospholipase C, which initiates the enhancement of phosphatidylinositol turnover. The enhancement of thrombin-induced histamine release by CT treatment with the observations that thrombin-induced histamine release was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin suggest that the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein in thrombin-induced biochemical events is an event distal to Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

  ".W": "We have carried out nanosecond fluorescence polarization studies of genetically engineered immunoglobulins to determine the structural features controlling their segmental flexibility. The proteins studied were hybrids of a relatively rigid isotype (mouse IgG1) and a relatively flexible one (mouse IgG2a). They have identical light chains and heavy chain variable regions and have the same combining sites for epsilon-dansyl-L-lysine, a fluorescent hapten. The fluorescence of the bound dansyl chromophore was excited at 348 nm with subnanosecond laser pulses, and the emission in the nanosecond time range was measured with a single-photon-counting apparatus. The emission anisotropy kinetics of the hybrid antibodies revealed that segmental flexibility is controlled by the heavy chain constant region 1 (CH1) as well as by the hinge. In contrast, the CH2 and CH3 domains did not influence segmental flexibility. The hinge and CH1 domains must be properly matched to allow facile movement of the Fab units. Studies of hybrids of IgG1 and IgG2a within CH1 showed that the loop formed by residues 131-139 is important in controlling segmental flexibility. X-ray crystallographic studies by others of human IgG1 have shown that this loop makes several van der Waals contacts with the hinge.\r"

To accomplish this we have devised a method to enzymatically generate and maintain fluorescence in live mammalian cells. Accumulation of fluorescent products in cells is linear with time, with a direct correlation of fluorescence to enzymatic activity. This technology for beta-galactosidase detection is more sensitive than other available cytochemical or biochemical methods. We have used this procedure to show that the expression of psi-2-MMuLVSVnlsLacZ in the T-cell lymphoma BW5147 and the B-cell hybridoma SP2/0 is not completely stable and that subclones selected by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter for low lacZ activity demonstrate distinctly lower average expression of LacZ. These findings indicate the utility of beta-galactosidase as a reporter molecule at the single-cell level for studies of gene regulation, including studies of promoter efficacy, enhancer activity, trans-acting factors, and other regulatory elements.\r"

After oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis, the mature protein-coding region of the LIF gene was introduced into the yeast expression vector YEpsec1. Yeast cells transformed with the resulting recombinant could be induced with galactose to produce high levels of a factor that induced the differentiation of murine M1 leukemic cells in a manner analogous to murine LIF. This factor competed with 125I-labeled native murine LIF for binding to specific cellular receptors on murine cells, compatible with a high degree of structural similarity between the murine and human factors.\r"

The genomic region that is interrupted by an insertion in a mutant carrying l(1)mys was used to isolate cDNA clones, and their sequences are presented here. The cDNA sequence predicts a cysteine-rich integral membrane protein that displays 45% sequence identity to chicken integrin and the human fibronectin receptor beta subunit and much greater similarity over localized segments. These similarities extend to other vertebrate integrin beta subunits, and we conclude that the myospheroid protein is an integrin beta subunit of Drosophila. This implies evolutionary conservation of a group of transmembrane proteins that are receptors for extracellular matrix and, coupled with the myospheroid phenotype, indicates an important role for the interaction of cells with extracellular matrix during development.\r"

Like MHV, HSV-1 and -2 cause local infections in their natural hosts, and direct contact between two individuals during the brief period of infectivity is needed for transmission. Because B virus, a nearer relative of HSV, depends on both oral and genital routes of transmission, we postulate that ancestral HSV (aHSV) was similar, and that for HSV-1 and -2 to diverge, genital and oral sites had to become microbiologically somewhat isolated from each other, while oral--oral and genital--genital contact had to be facilitated to maintain both aHSV strains. We propose that acquisition of continual sexual attractiveness by the ancestral human female and the adoption of close face-to-face mating, two hallmarks of human sexual behavior, provided the conditions for the divergence.\r"

Mutations in any of these three genes abolished translation of cytochrome b from an mRNA bearing the 5' two-thirds of the coxIII mRNA 5' untranslated leader, showing that all three gene products are required for translation of the chimeric mRNA and must act within the 5' two-thirds of the coxIII mRNA leader. Our data suggest that in wild-type cells, the specific activation of coxIII translation by PET494, PET54, and PET122 occurs by the action of these three gene products at a site or sites in a region of the 5' untranslated leader at least 172 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon.\r"

Oxidized DNA bases excised by DNA repair enzymes and excreted in urine were measured in four different species to determine the relation between specific metabolic rate (ml of O2 consumed per gram of body weight per hr) and oxidative DNA damage. An average of 6.04 nmol of thymine glycol per kg/day and 2.58 nmol of thymidine glycol per kg/day were found in mouse urine and 1.12 nmol of thymine glycol per kg/day and 0.95 nmol of thymidine glycol per kg/day were found in monkey urine. On a body weight basis, mice excrete 18 times more thymine glycol plus thymidine glycol than do humans, and monkeys excrete 4 times more thymine glycol plus thymidine glycol than do humans. When results among mice, rats, monkeys, and humans are compared, specific metabolic rate correlates highly with oxidative DNA damage. These findings are consistent with the theory that free radical-induced DNA damage may play a central role in the aging process.\r"

One class of mutators is specific for the G.C----T.A transversion as determined by the reversion pattern of a set of lacZ mutations and by the distribution of forward nonsense mutations in the lacI gene. The locus responsible for the mutator phenotype is designated mutY and maps near 64 min on the genetic map of E. coli.

The element associated with the -600 site enhances Sgs3 transcription when displaced with respect to the start site. This combined approach has defined sequence elements necessary both for normal transcript levels as well as the chromatin structure characteristic of Sgs3 activity in vivo.\r"

In sBL (7 out of 11) and AIDS-BL (5 out of 6), the breakpoints occurred within or near the IGH mu switch (S-mu) region on chromosome 14 and within the c-myc locus (MYC) on chromosome 8. In most eBL (13 out of 16) the breakpoints were mapped within or 5' to the IGH joining (JH region on chromosome 14 and outside the MYC locus on chromosome 8. Cloning and sequencing of the t(8;14) chromosomal junctions from two eBL cell lines and one eBL biopsy sample show that the recombinations do not involve IGH-specific recombination signals on chromosome 14 or homologous sequences on chromosome 8, suggesting that these events are not likely to be mediated by the same mechanisms or enzymes as in IGH rearrangements. In general, these data have implications for the timing of occurrence of chromosomal translocations during B-cell differentiation in different BL types.\r"

We have examined the relationship of ubiquitin staining with immunoreactivity for some of these proteins, both in frozen sections and in cytoskeletal fractions of Alzheimer brain material. We noted (i) antibodies specific solely for neurofilament and glial filament proteins failed to stain the fibrils stainable with ubiquitin. Tau-1 antibody stained some but not all of the ubiquitin-stained profiles; fibers staining only for tau or only for ubiquitin were also seen. (ii) The Tau-1-stained material was rather diffuse and granular, in contrast to the very sharply defined ubiquitin-positive profiles. (iii) When Tau-1 and ubiquitin stain the same fiber, Tau-1 immunoreactivity is often visualized as a diffuse cortical layer of material surrounding a core of ubiquitin immunoreactivity. (iv) The tau immunoreactivity can be almost totally removed by boiling Alzheimer brain cytoskeletal material in 2% NaDodSO4 containing a sulfhydryl reducing agent, this procedure apparently having no effect on the ubiquitin immunoreactivity. If similar material is boiled in 2% NaDodSO4 in the absence of a sulfhydryl reducing agent, the tau immunoreactivity is removed less efficiently, suggesting that tau epitopes are bound to the ubiquitin reactive material in a manner partially dependent on covalent disulfide bridges. These results show that the tau and ubiquitin distributions, both characteristic of Alzheimer disease, are qualitatively different, and that the two markers define immunologically and biochemically distinct structures.\r"

Males (whether initially subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 electric shocks) that were observed for 10 consecutive 5-min sessions, given a supplemental electric shock (followed by a 2-min rest), and then observed for 5 additional 5-min sessions spent only 88.9% as much time on the grids after the supplemental shock as they had been spending earlier. This avoidance of the potentially electrified grids corresponds to that observed in tests involving the exposure of flies to 0, 1, 2, or 3 electric shocks preceding the 10 5-min sessions. The results reveal (i) an extreme variation in the normal behavior among unshocked (control) males and (ii) an exponential decline in the length of time spent on the grids immediately after receiving 1, 2, or 3 shocks. These data confirm earlier reports on the conditioning of behavior in Drosophila by means of electric shocks; in addition, they remove an ambiguity inherent in the earlier studies, which relied on a presumed exposure of each of 150 or more flies to each shock as it was delivered.\r"

  ".W": "Thin descending limb cells from Henle's loop (from the inner strip of the outer medulla of long loops) were studied with optical and video techniques to identify the mechanisms of ion transport and cell volume regulation. Increasing the K+ concentration in the basolateral solution from 5 to 90 mM caused the cells to swell. This K+-induced swelling was inhibited by exposure of the basolateral membrane to 9 mM Ba2+ and was abolished by removing Cl- from the perfusion solutions. Decreasing the perfusion osmolality caused an increase in cell volume followed by a return to the preexposure volume. The latter regulatory decrease in hypoosmolality was slowed by basolateral Ba2+ and the removal of HCO-3 from the solutions. Further slowing occurred when both HCO-3 and Cl- were removed. Exposure of cells to ouabain abolished volume regulation. These data suggest that the basolateral cell membrane of the thin descending limb has a Cl- -dependent K+ permeability, which is important in cell volume regulation. The cells also possess Cl- and HCO-3 transport pathways that participate in volume regulation. Finally, volume regulation is dependent upon the operation of the Na/K pump.\r"

Their differing results were reconciled by adjusting the study population age distributions in the community-based studies, by excluding those cases that also showed respiratory symptoms, and by accounting for structural differences in the surveys. The reconciliation process provided an estimate of 99 million acute cases of either vomiting or diarrhea, or both, each year in this country, half of which involved more than a full day of restricted activity. The analysis was limited to cases of acute gastrointestinal diseases with vomiting or diarrhea but without respiratory symptoms. Physicians were consulted for 8.2 million illnesses; 250,000 of these required hospitalization. In 1985, hospitalizations incurred $560 million in medical costs and $200 million in lost productivity. Nonhospitalized cases (7.9 million) for which physicians were consulted incurred $690 million in medical costs and $2.06 billion in lost productivity. More than 90 million cases for which no physician was consulted cost an estimated $19.5 billion in lost productivity. The estimates excluded such costs as death, pain and suffering, lost leisure time, financial losses to food establishments, and legal expenses. According to these estimates, medical costs and lost productivity from acute intestinal infectious diseases amount to a minimum of about $23 billion a year in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "A Connecticut insurance company adopted a policy prohibiting smoking in all work areas. Three months later, the authors assessed smoking behavior changes and attitudes of a sample of 1,210 employees, 56.6 percent of the total. The survey showed that the policy of no smoking in the work areas did not markedly affect smoking cessation, that it reduced cigarette consumption for those who continued to smoke, that those who previously smoked most were most likely to reduce consumption, and that despite negative feelings about the policy by smokers, only 29 percent of smokers and 4 percent of nonsmokers wanted a worksite smoking policy eliminated. During the 1-year prepolicy period, smoking prevalence decreased from 25.2 percent to 23.6 percent of the sample. During the 3-month postpolicy period, smoking prevalence decreased to 22.0 percent. During the prepolicy period, consumption did not change significantly (from 0.99 to 0.95 packs per day) and few smokers increased (11 percent) or decreased (13 percent) consumption. During the postpolicy period, consumption decreased by 32 percent to 0.67 packs per day, and 12 times as many smokers decreased (44 percent) as increased (3.5 percent) consumption. Of those who smoked at least two packs per day, 93 percent smoked less after the policy. Among nonsmokers, 70 percent thought the policy had a positive overall effect on the work environment, compared with 19 percent of smokers.\r"

  ".W": "The Centers for Disease Control receives weekly reports of mortality due to all causes and to pneumonia and influenza from 121 cities and counties in the United States. To assess the epidemiologic applicability of these data, the trends of death rates based on data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control's mortality reporting system (CDC-MRS) from 1970 through 1979 were compared with trends derived from national mortality statistics compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). In general, CDC-MRS trends in death rates from all causes and from pneumonia and influenza followed patterns similar to those shown by mortality statistics for the entire nation. CDC-MRS data were particularly sensitive to annual fluctuations in the nationwide rate of death from pneumonia and influenza among the elderly population. However, because of higher death rates among residents of the CDC-MRS reporting areas, in addition to other ascertainment biases, CDC-MRS death rates--from all causes and from pneumonia and influenza--consistently exceeded NCHS rates for the nation. Moreover, for each age group, trends based on CDC-MRS reflected an underestimate of the rate of decline in mortality observed over time according to NCHS data. It is concluded that despite its limitations, the CDC-MRS provides mortality data that are both timely and useful for epidemiologic purposes.\r"

  ".W": "On April 26, 1986, a reactor unit at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl Power Station exploded, and substantial amounts of radioactive material were released. Fallout from this incident was deposited in the United States and elsewhere. Radioactive fallout is a major concern for obstetricians and pediatricians; their patients are the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of radiation. This study addresses the question: What are these physicians' perceptions and beliefs about fallout and its effects on their patients? A questionnaire was developed to measure these perceptions and beliefs. This instrument was mailed in November 1986 to all obstetricians and pediatricians listed in the telephone directory for western Massachusetts. A factor analysis of the physicians' responses yielded five factors: concern for patients, management of risk, effect of fallout, physicians' role in prevention, and guidance on advising patients. The physicians' responses to patients' inquiries were categorized as giving information, reassurance, and prescription. The authors recommend that the study be replicated with a more representative sample, that professional medical groups provide reliable information to members, and that physicians ask their professional organizations to address the issue of physician participation in the national planning process relevant to their concerns about radioactive fallout.\r"

The primary analytical unit was the census tract of mother's usual residence. The independent variable was defined as the percentage of low-income families in each tract at the 1980 census. Results of the analysis revealed that in spite of some very substantial declines in the overall level of infant mortality in recent decades, there continues to be a pronounced inverse association between the aggregate economic status of an area and the probability that a newborn infant will not survive the first year of life. This inverse association characterizes both males and females, whites as well as nonwhites, and it is observed during both the neonatal and postneonatal age intervals. Moreover, it is apparent that the adverse influence of a low economic status is reflected in the incidence of mortality from all major exogenous and endogenous causes. Since these two cause groups have such different underlying determinants, this finding has important implications for the development and implementation of specific maternal and child health care policies and programs.\r"

Differences in birth weights between these two sources were compared for the total group and were also stratified by sociodemographic and medical variables that might influence the accuracy of birth weight recall. An accurate birth weight was defined as one reported within 1 ounce of the birth certificate birth weight. We also calculated the proportion of birth weights that would be incorrectly classified as low or normal by maternal reporting. A total of 72,245 WIC records were matched with their corresponding birth certificates. Of these, 46,637 had WIC birth weights recorded within the specified birth weight range. Eighty-nine percent of birth weights were reported within 1 ounce of birth certificate birth weights. Lower accuracy of birth weight reporting was associated with the infant's low birth weight, preterm delivery, and low Apgar scores, and with the mother's grand multiparity, less than a high school education, black race, single marital status, and young age. Only 1.1 percent of birth weights would have been incorrectly classified into low or normal birth weight categories based on maternal reporting. Overall, our results suggest that maternally reported birth weights are sufficiently accurate for research and programmatic purposes when birth certificate information is not readily available.\r"

The primary purpose of the project was the development of a system to manage data related to prenatal, child health, family planning, and genetic services that are delivered with State support in clinics in the State of Ohio. The design of MATCH enables the same data base to be used at both the State and local levels. Because it allows all participants, central and district, to manipulate the raw data, it is called an end-user--as opposed to a batch retrieval--system. Data recorded on individual forms during each client's visit to local service clinics are collected and entered into a microcomputer whose software package is a commercial data base. The clinic can then use the data for its purposes: program planning, management, evaluation, client referrals, appointment followup, quality control, and billing. The same data are also uploaded by central office staff to the State's DEC mainframe from data-filled disks mailed in by the clinics. Personnel who staff local projects can access their own data on the mainframe computer to generate reports for local use and send and receive messages electronically. That is, the system is \"interactive.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One factor contributing to this problem has been the absence of courses on motor vehicle injury from the curriculums of the health professions schools. A comprehensive course on motor vehicle injury and death was developed, presented, and evaluated at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. The major course objectives were for students to (a) comprehend that highway injury is a major public health problem, (b) understand that this problem can be mitigated by proven public health techniques, and (c) understand and be able to implement multidisciplinary solutions. It was hoped that students would champion the prevention of motor vehicle injuries as a high priority for public health agencies and other professional and community organizations. The course has now been presented twice. A teaching guide was prepared and was reviewed by faculty at 13 schools of public health. This guide discusses practical aspects of introducing and implementing this type of course, overall course objectives, specific learning objectives, a model curriculum (with suggested readings) for nine topic areas, materials from which transparencies or slides could be made, and a geographic listing of resource persons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A review of the immunization records of all students at both schools was undertaken in order to assess the risk of a person contracting measles in relation to that person's immunization status. Two factors, the lack of an immunization record and immunization prior to 12 months of age, showed a positive association with contracting measles. The association was statistically significant at one high school but not the other. At the first high school, students who were immunized at 12 to 14 months of age had a greater risk of infection than those immunized at 15 months or older. However, age at immunization of 12 to 14 months was not associated with a significantly higher risk when persons with multiple doses of vaccine were excluded from the analysis. Students of both schools showed a lower attack rate for those who had received multiple doses of vaccine, but the difference was not statistically significant.\r"

Twenty percent of the Klamaths surveyed reported having diabetes, and more than 30 percent reported having arthritis, rheumatism, or hypertension, or having had their gallbladder removed. The data were compared with those of national surveys of Indian and non-Indian elders that also used the OARS instrument. Even though the Klamaths surveyed were younger than the comparison groups, their health status was no better than that of other Indians and was worse than that of the non-Indian population. Moreover, among these Klamath adults, health insurance coverage was lower, and perceived unmet needs for medical care were higher than in either of the comparison groups.\r"

They were counseled concerning the disease and their risk, and their initial reactions, their stated intentions concerning birth control and childbearing, and their subsequent childbearing histories were documented. Initial responses to the risk information varied widely, and stated intentions of birth control or childbearing did not accurately predict subsequent childbearing. Among 25 couples for whom there were complete childbearing data, there were 31 pregnancies with 13 affected children prior to counseling. After counseling, there were 25 pregnancies resulting in 10 affected children. The majority of the subsequent pregnancies occurred in the group who had not borne children or an affected child before counseling. In young couples, concern for producing a child with sickle cell anemia is often offset by a strong desire to have children regardless of risk.\r"

The most likely outcome would seem to be that the increases in black and Hispanic physicians will continue to 2000 at 1985 levels because the data show neither strong positive nor strong negative net influences for the factors examined.\r"

Research questions addressed were from what sources did they obtain their health information, what differences were there in patterns of response between middle-aged and older residents, and how much did various subgroups use health information. Respondents indicated they received most of their health information from printed materials, television, and informal network members, in that order, with little difference between rural and urban respondents. Radio and organizations, such as unions, were less frequently used as health information sources. The amount of information received from printed materials decreased slightly with age for women, but decreased sharply for men. The amount of information received from TV decreased with age, especially for urban residents. The youngest and oldest groups reported receiving the most health information from printed materials. TV was the most common source of health information for middle-aged adults. The findings indicate that persons disseminating health information should target their efforts through printed materials, TV, and informal networks. The most frequently mentioned sources of health information were TV specials, news stories, magazines, news articles, publications, medical books, and physicians. Radio and organizations, used by large segments of the population, are relatively untapped in terms of their potential, and not fully used when available. The urban elderly appear to receive little health information from any source.\r"

Mortality statistics for 1979-81 indicate that the standardized mortality ratio for cancer among Mexican immigrants is 72 percent of that among all white males and 77 percent of that among all white females. The age-adjusted death rates of the Mexican-born population for cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, bladder, and breast are significantly lower: less than 60 percent of those for the entire U.S. white population. Excessive levels of cancers of the stomach, liver, and cervix occur among Mexican-born U.S. residents; age-adjusted rates for these sites exceed the rates among the total U.S. white population by more than 75 percent. These data, based on U.S. diagnostic practices, confirm that broad differences--twofold, for some cancer sites--exist between the cancer rates among immigrants from Mexico and other whites in the United States. The close correspondence between the mortality data presented in this study and comparable incidence data from another study indicates that differential survival does not explain the differences in cancer mortality among Mexican immigrants.\r"

When average values for these variables are used in the analysis, routine chest CT adds about 1 day to a T1N0M0 patient's life expectancy and saves about $150 per patient. Furthermore, a true-positive yield of 6% is sufficient for chest CT to be both clinically useful and cost saving, provided CT is readily available.\r"

The activation of macrophages, which kill T. gondii in vivo, was inhibited by administration of the monoclonal antibody, but the production of antibodies to T. gondii was not suppressed. The fact that an antibody to interferon-gamma can eliminate resistance to acute Toxoplasma infection in mice suggests that this lymphokine is an important mediator of host resistance to this parasite.\r"

  ".W": "A cytoplasmic protein that greatly enhances the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of N-ras protein but does not affect the activity of oncogenic ras mutants has been recently described. This protein (GAP) is shown here to be ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes and to interact with H-ras as well as with N-ras proteins. To identify the region of ras p21 with which GAP interacts, 21 H-ras mutant proteins were purified and tested for their ability to undergo stimulation of GTPase activity by GAP. Mutations in nonessential regions of H-ras p21 as well as mutations in its carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 165-185) and purine binding region (residues 117 and 119) did not decrease the ability of the protein to respond to GAP. In addition, an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain did not block GAP activity, supporting the conclusion that GAP does not interact with this region. Transforming mutations at positions 12, 59, and 61 (the phosphoryl binding region) abolished GTPase stimulation by GAP. Point mutations in the putative effector region of ras p21 (amino acids 35, 36, and 38) were also insensitive to GAP. However, a point mutation at position 39, shown previously not to impair effector function, did not alter GAP-p21 interaction. These results indicate that GAP interaction may be essential for ras p21 biological activity and that it may be a ras effector protein.\r"

  ".W": "The serum concentrations of apolipoproteins C-III, B, and A-I were determined in children with type I diabetes mellitus to establish whether they correlated with the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1) and to determine whether these values differ between diabetic children and a population of normal children. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and apolipoprotein (Apo) levels were studied in 95 children with type I diabetes; 51 of the children were attending a diabetes clinic and 44 were attending a diabetes summer camp. The level of Hb A1 correlated with Apo C-III (P less than .001) and TC (P less than .001) values in the clinic group, but not with Apo A-I or TG levels in either group. The Apo C-III level was higher in both groups of diabetic children (8.0 +/- 0.5 and 9.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl) (P less than .01) than in normal subjects (6.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl). We conclude that the Apo C-III level tends to be higher in diabetics than in normal subjects, even in the normotriglyceridemic camp group. The Apo C-III level correlated with both the TC level and Hb A1, suggesting that Apo C-III determinations in type I diabetic patients may permit early identification of atherosclerotic risk.\r"

Blood specimens from twenty patients with known EDTA-induced platelet aggregation were consecutively drawn into three other anticoagulants (using Vacutainer tubes) and processed in a three-part differential Coulter Counter S Plus IV. PLT aggregation is shown to be generally induced by Li-heparin but much less frequently by citrate solutions. Prevention is almost invariably achieved by acid citrate dextrose (ACD). To that end approximately 2.5 mL of sterile ACD was aseptically injected beforehand through the stoppers of plain 5 mL Vacutainer tubes without breaking the vacuum. After blood drawing, correction for dilution was made by comparing hemoglobin values in EDTA and ACD.\r"

IL-2 receptor was found in 2 of 16 (13%) T-cell malignancies (1 T-ALL, 1 Sezary syndrome). In contrast, among B-cell disorders, IL-2 receptor was expressed in the majority of hairy cell leukemia cases (14 of 16, i.e., 88%) and a smaller proportion of cases of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7 of 44, i.e., 16%), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (8 of 20, i.e., 40%), B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3 of 5), and B-cell lymphoma (3 of 8). In addition, IL-2 receptor was present on the neoplastic cells in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (6 of 44, i.e., 14%) and acute undifferentiated leukemia (4 of 7). IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen) expression is thus found across the spectrum of hematologic neoplasms and is not restricted to T-cell disorders. The explanation for the expression of the IL-2 receptor by such a variety of different hematologic malignancies remains unclear.\r"

Immunologic observations in this patient include an elevated acetylcholine receptor antibody and antinuclear antibody titer, agglutination of mouse red blood cells when combined with the patient's serum, and lack of inhibition of binding of radioactive erythropoietin to mouse red cell receptors when combined with the patient's serum. Although both myasthenia with thymoma and pure red blood cell aplasia may have a common immunologic denominator, our findings in this case indicate that inhibition of erythropoiesis is unrelated to erythropoietin receptor blockade. An alternative hypothesis is offered based on defective T-cell function.\r"

Studies suggest that streptococcal carriers should show little clinical response to antibiotic therapy when compared with patients with true streptococcal infections. Patients with acute pharyngitis were divided into three groups: group 1--38 patients with negative throat cultures; group 2--72 patients with a positive throat culture and a significant rise in streptococcal antibody titers; and group 3--77 patients with positive throat cultures and no significant rise in streptococcal antibody titers. Patients in group 2 and group 3 had a comparable and dramatic clinical response to antibiotic therapy that was considerably greater than the clinical response in the patients in group 1. These findings raise questions about the appropriateness of using streptococcal antibody responses to distinguish between the streptococcal carrier state and a true streptococcal infection.\r"

  ".W": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked disease of coagulation caused by deficiency of factor VIII. Using cloned cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes, we have now screened 240 patients and found CG-to-TG transitions in an exon in nine. We have previously reported four of these patients; and here we report the remaining five, all of whom were severely affected. In one patient a TaqI site was lost in exon 23, and in the other four it was lost in exon 24. The novel exon 23 mutation is a CG-to-TG substitution at the codon for amino acid residue 2166, producing a nonsense codon in place of the normal codon for arginine. Similarly, the exon 24 mutations are also generated by CG-to-TG transitions, either on the sense strand producing nonsense mutations or on the antisense strand producing missense mutations (Arg to Gln) at position 2228. The novel missense mutations are the first such mutations observed in association with severe hemophilia A. These results provide further evidence that recurrent mutations are not uncommon in hemophilia A, and they also allow us to estimate that the extent of hypermutability of CG dinucleotides is 10-20 times greater than the average mutation rate for hemophilia A.\r"

Patients with proven allergic pollinosis were entered into a 1-week initial treatment period taking terfenadine 60 mg bid and only those who responded to the initial treatment with \"moderate\" to \"complete\" relief continued on terfenadine throughout a 4 to 11-week pollen season for evaluation of continued efficacy. A total of 179 patients from five study centers were enrolled in the initial treatment period and 154 (86%) responded to terfenadine with \"moderate\" to \"complete\" relief of symptoms. Of these 154 patients who continued terfenadine treatment, approximately 90% of the patients maintained the same degree of relief throughout the pollen season. All symptoms of seasonal pollinosis including nasal congestion improved significantly the first day of treatment. This improvement in symptoms continued during the first week and remained unabated throughout the pollen season. The incidence of adverse events was low with sedation being reported by only 2.8% of patients at some time point during the study. It is concluded that terfenadine is a safe and effective non-sedating antihistamine in the maintenance therapy of seasonal allergic pollinosis and that tolerance is not noted during continued administration.\r"

Neisseria gonorrhoeae samples in mixed cultures were slightly more difficult (3% to 5% decreased accuracy) to identify. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disk-diffusion and beta-lactamase tests were more accurate (98% to 99%) than minimum inhibitory concentration-dilution methods (92%). Currently, most laboratories use the commercially prepared beta-lactamase reagents and the disk-diffusion test. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards is currently standardizing methods for the susceptibility testing of several antibiotics against gonococci. The College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys will continue to monitor participant accuracy for the identification and resistance recognition of this epidemiologically important pathogen.\r"

The best prediction of charges was obtained when DRG assignment was combined with Injury Severity Scores and age. When the equation obtained by this approach was applied to a separate population of 301 patients, the average difference between the actual charge and that predicted was $38 and would have led to a 33-fold decrease in money lost by the hospital. Altering the DRG payment schedule as proposed would allow hospitals to be fairly compensated for the care of trauma patients.\r"

Ten pigs underwent a right-sided thoracotomy and right-sided upper pulmonary lobectomy with cannulation of the upper lobe bronchus for measurement of bronchial fistula flow rate. Animals underwent a random sequence of conventional ventilation (12 to 20 breaths per minute), conventional high-frequency jet ventilation (120 breaths per minute), and ultra-high-frequency jet ventilation (UHFJV; 450 breaths per minute). Hemodynamic measurements were similar in the three ventilatory modes, but oxygenation was best with UHFJV. Bronchial fistula flow was lowest with UHFJV and greatest with conventional ventilation. Ultra-high-frequency jet ventilation demonstrated superior oxygen loading, adequate carbon dioxide elimination, and the least flow through the fistula, suggesting that both ventilator design and frequency are important therapeutic variables in the management of major airway disruption.\r"

Inhibition of threonine aminoacylation was used to screen for anti-PL-7. Sera from 3 patients, 2 with polymyositis and 1 with polymyositis-overlap syndrome, and a fourth serum from a patient with dermatomyositis, which was previously found to contain anti-PL-7, inhibited greater than 90% of activity (3.7% of 109 sera). All 4 sera reacted strongly in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with enzyme that was either affinity purified with anti-PL-7 or was biochemically purified. There was no indication of cross-reactivity by aminoacylation inhibition or, for most sera, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-PL-7 is an uncommon myositis-associated antibody that is independent of anti-Jo-1, but is directed at a functionally related enzyme.\r"

The activity was highest in the Shochu group, followed by the Sake and beer groups with an approximately 2.1-, 1.7- and 1.5-fold increase in fibrinolytic activity, respectively, compared to the control. The enzyme could be further purified using urokinase-IgG-Sepharose immunoadsorbent column from the Shochu group and it reacted with and was inhibited by urokinase specific antibody. The main molecular weight of the active enzyme was about 30,000, and those of minor components were about 50,000 and 100,000, as determined by zymography. These findings suggest that some of the enzymes appearing in the plasma after drinking are related to 'urokinase-like plasminogen activator', being endogenously produced.\r"

All sera obtained 2-5 weeks after onset of disease contained IgM anti-HIV as demonstrated by an IgM antibody capture assay. The IgM antibodies appeared during the 2 first weeks of illness, reached peak titres at 2-5 weeks and declined thereafter to undetectable levels at 2-3 months after the onset of disease. By contrast, IgG anti-HIV appeared later, during the second week after the onset of symptoms, and did not reach maximal levels until the IgM response had waned. The first IgM antibodies to appear were directed against gag proteins. IgM antibodies against env antigens were found less frequently and later in the course of the disease. These results suggest that IgM antibody determination may be helpful in the diagnosis of early HIV infection as a possible addition to the combined use of antigen detection and a second generation ELISA, which, in the present study, was found to be highly reliable for diagnostic purposes.\r"

The precursor gp160 was purified on an immuno-affinity column containing antibodies from sera of HIV-1-seropositive patients. The precursor gp160 was then isolated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two out of four Balb/c mice, immunized with these purified preparations of gp160, developed specific circulating antibodies. A hybridoma cell line was subsequently isolated producing monoclonal antibody KL49/19 (IgG1, K) specific for gp160. This monoclonal antibody can specifically immunoprecipitate gp160, existing in HIV-1-infected cells. In an immunoblotting assay, it identifies mainly gp160 and shows a slight affinity for the mature glycoprotein, gp120. The monoclonal antibody is probably directed against an epitope in the polypeptide residue of gp160 since it can recognize a deglycosylated polypeptide of molecular weight 90,000, a product of gp160 digestion by endoglycosidase H (Endo H). It does not cross-react with any protein of HIV-2 by immunoblot or immunoprecipitation assays. By virtue of its specificity, the monoclonal antibody KL49/19 might provide a powerful probe with which to detect gp160 in cells which might partially express the HIV-1 genes.\r"

In five cases IgM anti-HIV was detected 1-3 1/4 months prior to IgG anti-HIV seroconversion, as detected by a commercially available ELISA, but in no case was IgM detected prior to IgG anti-HIV seroconversion, as detected by the more sensitive GACRIA (IgG antibody captive radio-immunoassay, see Subjects and methods) and immunoblot assays. In 22 out of 23 men (96%) the primary IgM response did not persist beyond 3 months. HIV antigenaemia was found before HIV antibody seroconversion in 6 out of 55 (11%) and concomitant with HIV antibody seroconversion in 8 out of 55 (15%) subjects. A 'flu-like' illness that might be ascribed to primary HIV infection was found in 37 out of 50 men (74%). A blood sample was taken from 11 men during or within 2 weeks of the illness: no serological markers of HIV infection were detected in four subjects, HIV antigen, IgM and IgG anti-HIV were detected in another four, HIV antigen was the only marker of HIV infection in two subjects, and in one subject, IgM and IgG anti-HIV were detected but not HIV antigen. These results indicate that no conclusive value can be attached to a negative IgM test in suspected primary HIV infection, and that any role for IgM anti-HIV testing in blood donor screening is highly questionable.\r"

HIV-Ag was detected in CSF of three patients before treatment. These patients became CSF HIV-Ag-negative within 8 weeks of treatment. One initially CSF HIV-Ag-negative patient became strongly CSF HIV-Ag-positive during interruption of zidovudine treatment; CSF HIV-Ag disappeared again after treatment was restarted. None of our patients showed a significant neurological improvement during the study. These results show that low-dose zidovudine can suppress viral expression in CSF. Whether suppression of viral replication can prevent future HIV-related neurological disease remains to be investigated.\r"

The degree of inhibition on p24 antigen ELISA depended on the relative concentrations of viral antigen and anti-p24 antibodies in the mixtures. The relevance of these observations to clinical specimens was demonstrated when serial plasma samples from nine AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients in a clinical trial of foscarnet therapy were assayed for p24 antigen. Six (66.6%) out of nine patients were negative on screening. However, when their plasma was centrifuged through a sucrose solution, virus particles were pelleted that were depleted of anti-p24 and virus-specific p24 antigen was detected in resuspended pellets obtained from samples from all six patients. Eight serial samples collected from a male homosexual over 50 weeks following seroconversion were also subjected to the separation procedure. HIV-1-antigen was detected in all eight samples. In the light of these observations, the application of the separation technique in monitoring the efficacy of zidovudine or other anti-retroviral therapy should reveal more precise antigen levels in patients who otherwise appear to be antigen-negative in HIV-antigen assays. We propose that the natural history of HIV infections follows a pattern of chronic viral infection with continuous shedding of virus particles circulating as immune complexes.\r"

A past history of genital ulcers was reported by 12 (63%) of 19 men with antibody to HIV versus 30 (31%) of 96 without antibody (P = 0.008). HIV infection was also positively associated with lack of circumcision, but was not associated with the etiology of the current genital ulcer. Logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, number of recent sex partners, recent prostitute contact, circumcision, tribal ethnic identity, past history of urethritis, and current diagnoses) confirmed only the association between prior history of genital ulcer disease and HIV infection; (P = 0.04, odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence limits, 1.01-5.47). The incidence of genital ulcers, particularly chancroid, is much higher in parts of Africa than in Europe or North America. This may contribute to the increased risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV in Africa. Aggressive control of chancroid and syphilis may offer one very feasible approach to reducing transmission of HIV in this region.\r"

One hundred and eighty were still alive and 112 of these on further analysis, were suspected of being infected. They were contacted and all but one agreed to be tested for HIV antibodies. Fifty recipients were found to be seropositive. They had been transfused with blood components from 14 of the 35 donors. The earliest observed transmission occurred in June 1982. The patterns of HIV transmission showed, with only one exception, that each donor who had transmitted HIV to one recipient had also transmitted it to all later recipients. Appropriate preserved sera and clinical records from five of the donors who had not transmitted the virus were found and analysed. The result indicated that these donors had acquired their HIV infection after their last blood donation. In conclusion, our study indicates that every antibody-positive donor transmits HIV to almost every recipient.\r"

Recruitment took place at methadone posts (not drug-free; i.e. a low-threshold programme on which some drug users continue to use hard drugs, but at a lower level) and the weekly evening sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic for drug-addicted prostitutes. Three hundred and ten drug users have so far been tested and interviewed. Eighty-one per cent reported intravenous drug use; 83% of the 166 females and 15% of the 144 men reported prostitution. Female prostitutes practised mainly vaginal and orogenital intercourse and reported frequent use of condoms (89% of vaginal and 64% of orogenital contact). Male prostitutes practised mainly orogenital and manual contact. At entry 88 of the 310 (28%) were HIV-antibody-seropositive; 85 of these 88 were intravenous drug users and three were male homosexuals. HIV-antigen was detected in two seropositive and one seronegative intravenous drug-user. Antibodies to HTLV-I were found in four out of 308. Risk factors independently associated with HIV-antibody seropositivity among intravenous drug users were: frequency of borrowing used needle or syringe, date of first intravenous drug use, recent intravenous drug use, time living in Amsterdam and German nationality. Of medical history data, an attack of herpes zoster in the previous 5 years had the greatest value in the prediction of the presence of HIV antibodies (relative risk 20.90; 95% confidence interval 2.41-167.27).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The production of interleukin 2 (IL2), and the expression of HLA Class II antigens and IL2 receptors by PHA-activated T lymphocytes were also evaluated. A severe impairment of both responsiveness and stimulatory capacity in MLR and AMLRs was found in the HIV-positive IDAs and not in the HIV-negative IDAs. The HIV-positive IDAs showed also a defective expression of HLA Class II antigens, whereas the IL2 production and the IL2 receptor expression were in the normal range. The present data are consistent with similar observations in male homosexuals with AIDS-related complex and confirm that the HIV infection induces a broad spectrum of immunological abnormalities leading to a progressive derangement of the immunocompetence.\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin (PT) catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of several guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins that are involved in the transduction of cell surface receptor-mediated signals. Involvement of such G-proteins in regulation of hematopoiesis by two growth factors, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and interleukin 3 (IL 3), was investigated using pertussis toxin. Continuous or pulse exposure of murine bone marrow cells to pertussis toxin inhibited CSF-1 or IL 3-induced colony formation by approximately 50%. Pertussis toxin inhibition was also demonstrated against partially separated marrow from 5-fluorouracil-treated mice. The toxin effect was blocked by heating (95 degrees C for 30 minutes), by antitoxin antibody and was not associated with increased cAMP levels in target cells. In experiments with murine marrow, toxin-mediated inhibition appeared to involve predominantly the macrophage lineage. IL 3 stimulation of proliferation of the murine marrow-derived factor-dependent cell line FDC-P1, as measured by 3H-TdR incorporation, and CSF-1 stimulation of pure populations of murine bone marrow derived macrophages, as measured by DNA content and cell number, was also inhibited. Analysis of the effects of pertussis toxin on the growth of single cells stimulated by IL 3 demonstrated that this inhibition involved a decreased growth rate rather than a toxic ablation of cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated FDC-P1 cells and was able to abrogate the PT inhibition of IL 3 stimulation of these cells, suggesting but not establishing that IL 3 may mediate its proliferative effects through activating protein kinase C.\r"

The leukemic cells were morphologically ordinary lymphocytes showing suppressor/cytotoxic(s/c) T cell phenotypes and containing S-100b protein. Southern blot analysis revealed rearrangement of the beta chain genes of the T cell receptor (TcR) of the leukemic cells. Because these phenotypic and morphologic features were identical with those of S-100 beta+T lymphocytes (S-100 beta +TL) in normal human peripheral blood, we regarded this case as S-100 beta +T cell leukemia. We discussed clinicopathological features of S-100 beta +T cell leukemia/lymphoma by assessing similar cases reported so far. S-100 beta +T cell leukemia/lymphoma is a new type of s/c T lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma with aggressive features.\r"

Hairy cell leukemia is a chronic disorder caused by expansion of a clonal population of an unusual mononuclear cell of B cell origin. These cells have previously been shown to express an IL-2 receptor on the cell membrane. The sera of 26 patients with hairy cell leukemia were examined for the presence of a soluble IL-2 receptor before and during therapy with either recombinant interferon alpha-2a or 2'-deoxycoformycin. Before therapy, all patients had markedly elevated levels of this soluble IL-2 receptor ranging from five to 60 times the highest level observed in normal control sera. In individual patients changes in the level during therapy correlated well with clinical assessments of tumor response; levels fell to near the normal range in patients responding to therapy. Patients not responding to interferon alpha had no significant change in the soluble IL-2 receptor level. These results suggest that hairy cells secrete a soluble IL-2 receptor and that serial measurements of the level of this receptor in the serum can be used as a noninvasive means to assess disease response to therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary thrombolysis with t-PA is generally implemented with concomitant administration of heparin. However, results of studies in vitro suggest that heparin competes with fibrin for binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), augments activation of free plasminogen, decreases fibrin specificity, and impairs thrombolysis. To define the biological implications of these observations, we characterized effects of therapeutic concentrations of heparin on the binding of t-PA to thrombi formed in whole blood, effects of heparin on activation of plasminogen by t-PA in plasma, and effects of heparin on thrombolysis induced by t-PA in a clot lysis system designed to simulate conditions in vivo. The amount of t-PA bound to thrombi was not affected by heparin (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 U/mL). When t-PA activity was selectively and irreversibly inhibited by D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) the amount of t-PA-PPACK bound was similarly unaffected by heparin. Thrombolysis measured by 125I-fibrin(ogen) release and by reduction of mass of thrombi were not altered by heparin. Heparin did not affect plasminogen consumption induced by t-PA. Plasma concentrations of alpha-2-antiplasmin after exposure of blood to t-PA were less depressed with increasing concentrations of heparin. Thus, heparin in therapeutic concentrations does not interfere with binding of t-PA to thrombi, augment activation of free plasminogen, or inhibit thrombolysis. Accordingly, it appears likely that concomitant administration of heparin will not impair thrombolysis with t-PA implemented clinically.\r"

  ".W": "We observed a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected homosexual male with AIDS related complex (ARC) who had a serum globulin level of 80 g/L. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a gamma globulin fraction of 40 g/L, of which 50% (20 g/L) was contained within a paraprotein spike, comprised predominantly of IgG kappa. This patient also had high titer anti-HIV antibodies in his serum, which were Western blot reactive at a final dilution of 1:500,000, and recognized gp120env, p66pol, p55gag, p53pol, p41gag, and p24gag. Because paraproteins in the past have been shown to be directed against specific antigens, we purified this patient's paraprotein using a modified high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-hydroxylapatite procedure and tested the purified paraprotein for anti-HIV antibody activity. The purified paraprotein retained anti-HIV antibody activity to a final dilution of 1:100,000, and recognized p66pol, p55gag, p53pol, p41gag, and p24gag. The recognition of both \"gag\" and \"pol\" gene products suggested that the purified paraprotein might not be monoclonal in origin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that the purified paraprotein contained at least two immunoglobulin light chain species (Mol wt 30 to 33 Kd). Affinity chromatography of the purified paraprotein using a p24-Sepharose 4B matrix separated the \"gag\" and \"pol\" antibody activities. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis of a bone marrow aspirate (which contained 15% plasma cells) failed to reveal a clonal population of immunoglobulin producing cells. We conclude that this patient's paraprotein accounted for most of the anti-HIV activity present in whole serum, and that this paraprotein was not monoclonal in origin.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the cellular and molecular basis of eight cases of infant null acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All eight patients were under 9 months of age and presented with leukocyte counts in excess of 60 X 10(9)/L, organomegaly, and in two cases CNS infiltration. Although seven cases were morphologically classified as ALL, one patient had both lymphoid and myeloid features. Phenotypic analysis of leukemic blasts from all patients showed a typical null ALL pattern, ie, CD10 (common ALL antigen)-negative, strongly HLA-DR-positive, and CD19 (B4)-positive. The presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) at presentation was positive in six patients' cells and negative in two. Two patients also expressed the myeloid-associated markers CD33 (MY9) and CD15 (TG1), and coexpression of CD19 and CD33 was confirmed in these two by using dual marker flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Electron microscopic examination of the same two patients' cells showed the presence of monocytoid blasts that labeled with the pan-B cell antibody B4 (CD19). Short-term culture of one of these patients cells in the presence of phorbol ester resulted in the majority of the cells exhibiting myeloid markers, strong nonspecific esterase positivity, and phagocytic properties. Cytogenetic analysis showed the common feature in 7 of 8 cases to be a break in band 11q23. Molecular analysis of DNA from the blast cells of all eight patients showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in all cases without, however, any evidence of kappa light-chain rearrangement. T cell receptor genes were present in the germline configuration in all cases. Rearrangements of the c-ets 1 oncogene, which maps to band 11q23, were not detected, thus providing no evidence for involvement of this oncogene in the common disease process. Our data indicate that although infant null ALL may present as a heterogeneous disease the similarity of many features between cases suggests a common derivation from a precursor cell sharing phenotypic and genotypic features of both B and myeloid progenitor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We report here experiments on the analysis of cellular signal transduction in a series of patients with chronic B cell disorders (B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B-CLL] and prolymphocytic leukemia). We compared the response of the leukemic cells with primary external signals (interleukin 2 [IL-2] or B cell differentiation factors [BCDF or IL-6]) with their response to secondary inducers (the phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA] or the calcium ionophore A23187) that circumvent the first part of the signal transduction pathway by directly activating the key enzyme protein kinase C. One BCDF was synthesized by mitogen-activated peripheral blood B lymphocytes; a second BCDF was constitutively produced by the human bladder carcinoma cell line T24. Changes in morphology, Tac (IL-2 receptor) expression, RNA synthesis measured by 3H-uridine uptake, and immunoglobulin production tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used as parameters of successful signal transduction. TPA alone and TPA plus A23187 (synergistically) effectively initiated differentiation in all the leukemia cases. Neither IL-2 nor BCDF (singly or in combinations) caused equivalent responses. On the other hand, IL-2 and BCDF produced a substantial differentiation effect on normal B lymphocytes. Our data suggest that (a) B-CLL cells are able to respond to direct stimulation of the second messenger pathway (through protein kinase C) but not to the physiological stimuli IL-2 or BCDF; (b) the defect in signal transduction appears to be located upstream of protein kinase C (a possible candidate is a G protein); (c) malignant B cells may spontaneously or after treatment with inducers express the IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen) in the absence of a functional differentiating response to IL-2; and (d) signs of proliferation/differentiation in B-CLL samples after incubation with IL-2 or BCDF might be due to contamination of the cell populations with residual normal B cells.\r"

Respiratory distress developed during the cell separator run, which led us to ask whether the procedure could have changed the adhesive properties of her cells. C5a desarginine, N-f-Met-Leu-Phe, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen all failed to aggregate her lymphocytes in vitro, but arachidonic acid, excess free calcium, and 4 mumol/L epinephrine did aggregate the cells. Arachidonate-induced aggregation appeared to be a toxic phenomenon: the ED50 for aggregation was statistically indistinguishable from that for cytotoxicity, and aspirin only mildly blunted the response. In contrast, epinephrine-induced aggregation was not associated with lactic dehydrogenase release or the loss of trypan blue exclusion and was blunted by propranolol; radiopindolol-binding studies confirmed the presence of a beta-adrenergic receptor. There were approximately 3,000 receptors/cell, with no statistically significant difference between normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells or between B cells and T cells (separated by rosetting techniques). The Kd for the B cells' receptor, however, was less than that for T cells by a factor of ten (P less than .01). We conclude that B cells may aggregate when stimulated and that they--like T cells--have beta-adrenergic receptors. Adrenergically mediated changes in B cell adhesiveness may play a role in regulating lymphocyte traffic; in the rare patient with truly enormous B cell counts, we postulate that they may be an occasional cause of morbidity.\r"

Collagenase, the initiating enzyme in collagen degradation, is synthesized on demand and controlled by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Antibodies to collagenase and TIMP were applied to colonic anastomoses in rabbits to investigate the role of the enzyme during healing. Within 12 h of operation, secreting cells and extracellular collagenase were identified at the everted edges of the bowel wall. After 24 h, collagenase activity was accompanied by TIMP secretion in the same localized regions, and by the third postoperative day very few cells were still synthesizing enzyme in these areas, although extracellular activity remained visible. TIMP-secreting cells, however, were seen in a layer of connective tissue sealing the serosal surface of the anastomosis. At 7 days, both enzyme and inhibitor were found only in small aggregates of secreting cells in the deeper layers. The localization and extent of collagenase and TIMP activity accorded well with a normal healing response as, at all times, the enzyme was confined to the immediate vicinity of the suture line.\r"

  ".U": "88193687\r", 
  ".W": "The longest component of the total delay in coming under coronary care is patient delay, and it has been suggested that public education might be used to make it shorter. The patterns of patient delay were studied in 450 patients with acute myocardial infarction uncomplicated by cardiac arrest out of hospital, of whom 243 had a previous history of ischaemic heart disease. Patient delays had a skewed distribution with a modal delay of up to one hour, a median delay of two hours, and a mean delay of 10 hours. Two thirds of patients had sought help from their general practitioners within four hours of the onset of symptoms. During the first four hours the longer that patients delayed the lower was the subsequent mortality (27%, 18%, and 9% for delays of one hour or less, up to two hours, and up to four hours, respectively), but patients who delayed four to eight hours had the highest mortality of all (38%). Neither the median value nor the pattern of patient delays was altered by a previous history of ischaemic heart disease. There were pronounced differences in doctor delays, depending on the patient's age, delay time, and ultimate place of treatment, showing that the doctors' behaviour was influenced before they had seen their patients. Nevertheless, the median total delay for patients aged up to 70 was one hour 35 minutes, and a higher proportion of patients were seen early after infarction than in recent hospital trials of thrombolytic treatment. These findings suggest that the patients' call for help and the doctors' response may be at an instinctive level according to the patients' distress; these patterns of behaviour may be difficult to modify by public education.\r"

The subjects were divided into six groups on the basis of their blood pressures (from less than 120 to greater than 200 mm Hg systolic, from less than 70 to greater than 110 diastolic). The greatest mortality was observed in those in the lowest systolic and lowest diastolic groups. Mortality was least in subjects with systolic pressures of 160 mm Hg or more and diastolic pressures of 90 mm Hg or more. The most essential finding in this series of the very old was an increased mortality in the lowest blood pressure groups.\r"

Both pneumonia and asthma or wheezy bronchitis to age 7 were associated with a significant excess in the prevalence of chronic cough and phlegm at age 23 after controlling for current smoking. This excess was largely attributable to the association of cough and phlegm at age 23 with a history of asthma or wheezy bronchitis from age 16. When adjustment was made for recent wheezing, current cigarette consumption, previous smoking habit, and passive exposure to smoke the relative odds of cough or phlegm, or both, in subjects with a history of childhood chest illness was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.27). When analysed separately asthma, wheezy bronchitis, and pneumonia up to age 7 did not significantly increase the prevalence of either cough or phlegm. The explanation for the observed continuity between chest illness in childhood and respiratory symptoms in later life may lie more in the time course of functional disturbances related to asthma than in the persistence of structural lung damage.\r"

Mean risks of upper respiratory tract infection were 64% higher in the study group than in the controls, the largest monthly differences being recorded in the months of harder training. These findings were unlikely to have been due solely to harder training in the study group, as concurrently measured sprains (arguably more likely to have been affected) were increased by only 19%. A more likely explanation was some degree of immunosuppression, physical stress possibly having a synergistic effect. These findings suggest that travellers taking dapsone-pyrimethamine as antimalarial prophylaxis may be rendered more susceptible to commoner infections, especially when engaged in increased physical activity.\r"

This was done by extracting information about the individual practices from the Department of Health and Social Services (Northern Ireland) information technology unit's database on prescribing. General practitioners in practices with high costs issued prescriptions more often and for larger quantities of medicine than did their colleagues in practices with low costs for all of the drug groups studied. There was a lower patient to doctor ratio in the practices with high costs (1786:1 v 2039:1). The prescribers with high costs offered more surgery sessions than their colleagues with low costs, amounting to an average of 6.5 extra surgery sessions per 1000 patients per month. Half as many more patients with heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and thyroid disease seemed to be treated by doctors in practices with high costs than in practices with low costs. A higher rate of prescribing symptomatic drugs by these same doctors was also seen, and further study is recommended in view of the risks associated with these drugs.\r"
