Because traditional education methods have had limited impact on \"appropriate\" antibiotic use, the potential of the newer strategies must be explored. Most published studies emanate from teaching hospitals, leaving the applicability of the findings to community hospitals largely unsettled. At each hospital, it should be determined which combination of strategies will strike the best balance between effectiveness and palatability.

A wider definition of \"universal precautions,\" which approaches the \"Body Substance Isolation\" system, is discussed.

Early recognition of viral diseases should, in turn, permit us to institute, and further evaluate, specific measures for their control. Appreciation of the epidemiology and transmission of these viruses will provide the framework for successful infection control strategies.\r"

Due to the high fatality rate of nosocomial pneumonia and the poor outcomes despite the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy, efforts have been directed at the prevention of infection. Efforts have included the discrete use of antibiotics, compliance with standard infection control techniques, a knowledge of the risks associated with respiratory therapy equipment, proper patient positioning to reduce the chance of gastric reflux, reduction of gastric overgrowth with bacteria, and in some patients, local antibiotics to reduce colonization in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract.

The introduction of new technologies, including enhanced life support techniques ranging from blood products to parenteral nutrient supplementation, also afford opportunities for previously nonpathogenic organisms to take advantage of new niches. Changes in the inanimate environment, such as ventilatory systems, and changes in personnel and infection control protocols (for example, disinfectants) may also alter the resident nosocomial flora. The resultant challenges to clinicians are to be aware of changes in the prevalence of different organisms and susceptibility patterns in the local hospital and community, and to be knowledgeable about new anti-microbial agents that have activity against multiply resistant pathogens. Judicious antibiotic use and careful application of hospital infection control measures are likely to be effective in meeting these challenges. Ongoing clinical and molecular epidemiological studies are required to better anticipate the emergency and spread of new, distinctive nosocomial pathogens.\r"

Although coagulase-negative staphylococci are common contaminants in blood cultures, even a single isolation of these organisms warrants careful evaluation.

In the future, both prevention and the development of alternative antimicrobial agents will play important roles in limiting the morbidity and mortality of these infections.\r"

CD44 is also present on human E. On E, CD44 has been shown to be regulated by the In(Lu) dominant inhibitor gene and to express the Ina and Inb blood group Ag. Because human E have been shown to interact with human T cells via CD2 on T cells and LFA-3 on human E, we have studied the ability of human E and T lymphocyte CD44 Ag to participate in CD2/LFA-3 interactions between human E and T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that a mAb (A3D8) against the CD44, In(Lu)-related p80, lymphocyte homing-receptor molecule inhibited the binding of human E to human T cells. Whereas whole CD44 antibody molecules inhibited human E binding to T cells, saturating amounts of CD44 Fab fragments did not inhibit human E to T cell binding. Our data demonstrated that anti-CD44 antibody A3D8 acted at the level of the E to inhibit CD2/LFA-3 interactions between human E and T cells.\r"

Binding characteristics of these three mAb were investigated against Ag (ReLPS, lipid A, derivatives of lipid A) in solid phase (ELISA) and in fluid phase (C consumption, inhibition studies), and upon incorporation in membranes (E: passive hemolysis assay, and liposomes: inhibition studies). Cross-reactivity with heterologous Ag was investigated in ELISA (LPS, Gram-negative bacteria) and immunoblot experiments (LPS). The binding specificity of mAb 26-5 (IgG2b), raised against synthetic lipid A, was located in the hydrophilic region of biphospholipid A and was also exposed after membrane incorporation of lipid A or after preincubation of lipid A with polymyxin B (PMX). mAb 26-20 (IgM), also raised against synthetic lipid A, showed binding specificity for the hydrophobic region of lipid A: no binding to membrane-associated lipid A could be demonstrated, and binding in ELISA could be blocked very efficiently by PMX. The reaction pattern of mAb 8-2 (IgM), raised against the heat-killed Re mutant of Salmonella typhimurium, was in part similar to that of mAb 26-20. However, inhibition of binding with PMX was less efficient and a high specificity for ReLPS, also after membrane incorporation of this Ag, was demonstrated. In contrast to mAb 26-5 and 26-20, mAb 8-2 showed extensive cross-reactivity with heterologous LPS preparations and heat-killed as well as live Gram-negative bacteria. It is concluded that each of the three mAb binds to a different antigenic epitope in lipid A and that exposure of those epitopes for antibody binding is restricted in a differential manner, depending on mode of Ag presentation. The here defined reaction patterns provide a basis for the interpretation of potential inhibitory effects on in vitro and in vivo biologic (and toxic) activities of endotoxins and Gram-negative bacteria.\r"

Although the effects of GM-CSF are diverse and GM-CSF has entered into clinical trials, relatively little is known about signal transduction pathways utilized by GM-CSF. In view of previous studies which have suggested that some of the effects of GM-CSF on monocyte-macrophages can be mimicked by agents which increase intracellular cAMP, we investigated the effect of rGM-CSF on adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in murine peritoneal macrophages. Adenylate cyclase activity was quantitated in macrophage membrane preparations and in intact cells. In seven separate experiments, GM-CSF (50 U/ml) increased AC activity by 61(6)% relative to macrophages treated with carrier medium alone. A dose-dependent increase in AC activity was observed (10 to 100 U/ml) which peaked within 1 to 5 min after the addition of GM-CSF and returned to basal levels by 10 to 20 min. Lineweaver-Burk analysis revealed that the Vmax of macrophage AC was increased from 0.40 to 0.52 pmoles cAMP/min by GM-CSF but the Km was unchanged. Intracellular cAMP was increased by GM-CSF to 129(27)% of control values by 1 min of treatment (n = 6). Under similar experimental conditions, GM-CSF did not increase the activity of PK C (n = 14) or phospholipase A2 (n = 3) in peritoneal macrophages. These data show that macrophage adenylate cyclase activity is rapidly stimulated by GM-CSF. Moreover, these findings support further study of the role of cAMP in transmitting the intracellular signals initiated by GM-CSF in tissue macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "90079028\r", 
  ".W": "The superoxide-forming NADPH oxidase of resting macrophages can be activated in a cell-free system by certain anionic amphiphiles, most notably SDS. Activation requires the cooperation of membrane-associated and cytosolic components. We now report that at least two cytosolic factors are required for SDS-elicited activation of NADPH oxidase of guinea pig macrophages. Treatment of cytosol with ammonium sulfate at 37% saturation led to the partition of the two factors in the supernatant and precipitate fractions (termed components sigma 1 and sigma 2, respectively). Although each fraction by itself was inactive, recombining them resulted in complete recovery of the original ability of native cytosol to support SDS-elicited superoxide production by octyl-glucoside solubilized macrophage membranes. Both components are proteins, as shown by their susceptibility to trypsin and proteinase K, and were inactivated by heating at 60 degrees C. sigma 2, but not sigma 1, was inactivated by treatment with the covalent sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide. On high-performance gel filtration, sigma 1 was found to have a molecular mass of 30 to 52 kDa, whereas sigma 2 eluted with molecules of 150 to 440 kDa. Component sigma 1 was partially purified from the ammonium sulfate supernatant fraction of cytosol by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by gel filtration. A material behaving like sigma 1 was also found to be present in the cytosol of guinea pig thymus cells, lymph node lymphocytes and brain and of the mouse myeloma cell line MOPC 315. However, sigma 2 appears to be strictly phagocyte specific. The molecular characteristics of sigma 1 components from nonphagocytic cells were similar to those of macrophage sigma 1, as shown by their presence in the supernatant, after treatment of cytosol with ammonium sulfate at 37% saturation, a molecular mass close to 30 to 52 kDa and a similar behavior on hydrophobic interaction chromatography. These findings raise the possibility that cytosolic component sigma 1 might be the bearer of a cellular function, more general than the one suggested by its role in the activation of NADPH oxidase of phagocytes.\r"

We reported previously that certain murine fibroblasts infected with group C human adenoviruses become sensitive to cytolysis by TNF, and that a 14,700 m.w. (14.7K) protein encoded by the E3 transcription unit protects the cells from TNF cytolysis. We now report the mapping of the adenovirus genes that induce sensitivity to TNF cytolysis. Experiments using hydroxyurea or 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine showed that sensitivity is conferred by an early gene. Further mapping was done by infecting cells with double mutants that lack both the TNF protection function of the E3-14.7K protein and various other early genes and testing infected cells for TNF sensitivity. Using this method we found that none of the genes in regions E1B, E3, E4, or VA1-RNA are involved in creating the TNF-sensitive cellular phenotype. However, TNF did not lyse cells infected with dl312, an adenovirus mutant that lacks the 14.7K gene plus region E1A, suggesting that the E1A proteins are required to induce sensitivity to TNF. Mutants dl237 and 13SWT, which produce only the 12S (243R) or 13S (289R) E1A proteins, respectively, do render infected cells sensitive to TNF, indicating that both proteins provide this function. Finally, E1A-transfected cells, which are sensitive to TNF killing, do not become more sensitive when infected with dl312, thus indicating that E1A alone among adenovirus genes is responsible for the TNF susceptibility of infected cells.\r"

We conclude that proteins binding at both sites act coordinately, leading to maximal induction of the receptor gene.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated the relationship between the neuronal myc gene (NMYC) and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in human neuroblastoma (NB) tumor cell lines. Class I MHC surface Ag expression in NB cell lines varied from nearly undetectable to levels nearly as high as in a lymphoblastoid cell line. Class I MHC mRNA levels in NMYC-amplified NB cell lines were lower than levels observed in single copy NMYC NB cell lines. However, considerable variation in class I MHC surface Ag and mRNA expression was evident in NMYC-amplified cell lines. To determine directly whether NMYC might modulate class I MHC expression in NB, we transfected a plasmid containing a recombinant NMYC gene into two tumor cell lines derived from a NB and a related neuroepithelioma tumor. Constitutive overexpression of the recombinant NMYC gene produced no consistent change in class I MHC surface Ag or mRNA levels. To determine whether class I MHC expression might be developmentally regulated in adrenal medullary cells, the precursor cells of adrenal NB tumors, beta 2-microglobulin expression was measured in fetal and adult adrenal glands. beta 2-Microglobulin expression was not evident in the neuroblasts of a 24-wk-old fetal adrenal gland, whereas beta 2-microglobulin expression was present in the adult adrenal medulla. These data suggest that variation in class I MHC expression among NB cells may reflect the developmental stage at which neuroblasts were arrested during tumorigenesis.\r"

LBRM Sup provided a priming signal to MO, but required the subsequent addition of small amounts of LPS for the expression of tumor cytotoxicity. The identity of the lymphokine responsible for this MAF activity was investigated. IFN-gamma, the only previously characterized lymphokine capable of priming MO for tumor cytotoxicity, did have MAF activity in the assay, but IFN-gamma could not be detected by ELISA in LBRM Sup, and LBRM-derived mRNA lacked detectable message for IFN-gamma. Moreover, anti-IFN-gamma failed to inhibit the MAF activity of LBRM Sup, suggesting that the presence of small, undetectable amounts of IFN-gamma were neither responsible nor required for LBRM MAF activity. LBRM MAF activity appeared distinct from the other previously identified lymphokines produced by LBRM, since granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-2, and IL-3 purified from LBRM Sup were unable to activate MO to lyse RBL. IL-4 and TNF, two lymphokines not known to be produced by LBRM but able to activate MO for cytotoxicity of some tumor targets, were also unable to activate MO for RBL cytotoxicity. LBRM MAF lacked antiviral activity in biologic assays, further distinguishing the lymphokine from IFN-gamma, and had an apparent Mr of 30,000 Da using gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the LBRM T cell line produces a previously undescribed lymphokine that primes MO for tumor cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of IL-2 on the expression of homing receptors by lymphocytes of NK or lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell derivation has not yet been evaluated. We developed a murine model to evaluate the potential of LAK cells to localize into peripheral lymph nodes since LAK cells are used to treat human cancers which have metastasized to these tissues. Using a frozen section binding assay, LAK cell adhesion to the lymph node microvasculature was easily demonstrable. Inhibition studies demonstrated that LAK cell binding to lymph nodes was mediated by mechanisms previously described in T cells. LAK cell surface expression of the 85- to 95-kDa homing receptor recognized by the antibody MEL-14 on LAK cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. The percentage of cells which bound MEL-14 decreased slightly over 3 days of IL-2 exposure (from 73 to 60%), particularly in the large granular lymphocyte (cytotoxic effector) subpopulation (45% MEL-14+). The expression of another homing-related molecule, leukocyte function-associated Ag-1, markedly increased during activation of LAK cells. Despite the expression of these homing receptors, we observed almost no LAK cell localization into lymph nodes in vivo. Furthermore, IL-2 pretreatment of recipient animals did not increase the adhesion of LAK cells to lymph node microvasculature or enhance their extravasation. IL-2 activation of non-T, non-B lymphocytes results in significant changes in both the expression and function of cell surface homing receptors. Our results indicate that in vitro analysis does not always predict in vivo localization potential.\r"

Patients treated with pinacidil exhibited significant average decrements from baseline in concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and a significant average increment in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean effects seen in the pinacidil group were significantly greater than those in the placebo group for both total cholesterol (-9.8 vs +4.2 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides (-21.6 vs +8.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). The effects seen in patients given pinacidil were also significantly greater than those seen in the patients treated with prazosin for both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+3.6 vs -1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and triglycerides (-14.8 vs +30.3 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). Negative effects of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol on blood lipids were not apparent in patients given pinacidil. Thus, pinacidil treatment of hypertension is associated with a beneficial effect on blood lipids, which may be of clinical significance.\r"

When analyzed retrospectively, A. fumigatus antigen was detected in three of four patients (75%) with proved invasive aspergillosis at autopsy or biopsy and in a solitary patient with suspected but not proved invasive aspergillosis. No antigen was detected in 17 bone marrow transplant unit patients without proved or suspected invasive aspergillosis or in 16 healthy control subjects. Detection of antigen rose with an increasing number of samples tested. A. fumigatus antibody levels were not helpful in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, although in a few patients antibody levels decreased just before death.\r"

Serum potassium values were monitored every 2 weeks while patients took the salt substitute. It was found that the salt substitute was very effective at maintaining patients' serum potassium in the normal range. A questionnaire completed at the end of the 6-week period showed that only three patients experienced any side effects from the salt substitute, none of which was severe enough to warrant discontinuation of the product. The questionnaire also revealed, however, that patients did not care for the salt substitute, and at the end of the study, eight out of the 10 subjects chose to return to their prescription potassium product despite a marked cost advantage in favor of the salt substitute. While this study shows that salt substitutes are an effective, safe, and economical alternative to prescription potassium products, poor patient acceptance of this agent is discouraging. acceptance\r"

Nonetheless, clinical conditions have required the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs in spite of the inherent difficulties with them. The history of sedative-hypnotic drugs is replete with attempts to produce a safe and effective drug. The introduction of one sedative-hypnotic drug for another has been heralded by unguarded optimism and misguided claims. History has repeated itself with each new drug. Toxicities, abuse, addiction, and development of tolerance and dependence have remained in force for each drug that has appeared on the market. Only minor variations on a theme have differentiated one drug from another as the essential features have remained in force.\r"

Six patients (2.7%) were found to have retroviral infection, four with HIV-1 and two with HTLV-I. The four patients with HIV-1 infection were negative before and became EIA and Western blot positive following transplantation. All patients had transient HIV-1 antigenemia documented before antibody was detected. One patient died of Kaposi's sarcoma 2 years posttransplantion with a functioning graft. One is alive and asymptomatic 4 years posttransplant, and two rejected their grafts and are asymptomatic on maintenance hemodialysis. Six patients tested positive for HTLV-I by EIA. Only two patients, however, were also positive for HTLV-I by Western blot, RIPA, and p24 antigen RIA, one prior to and one after transplantation. Both had HTLV-I-positive lymphocyte cultures and remain asymptomatic of retroviral infection 3 years after renal transplantation. A third patient, positive for HTLV-I by EIA, had indeterminate Western blot and negative RIPA, RIA, and lymphocyte culture. Intravenous drug use was not a risk factor for retroviral infection in this patient population. It is likely that patients became infected peritransplantation from blood transfusions. Contamination by donor kidneys, however, cannot be excluded.\r"

Consequently, experiments were performed to correlate endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation with changes in intestinal mucosal structure and xanthine dehydrogenase and oxidase activity. Segments of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, proximal colon, distal colon, and liver were harvested from ICR mice 24 hr after IP administration of E. coli 0111:B4 endotoxin (0.1 mg). Xanthine dehydrogenase and oxidase activities were measured in these samples and correlated with intestinal morphology. Bacteria translocated from the intestines to extraintestinal organs in 70% of the mice receiving endotoxin, while the organs of control mice were sterile (p less than 0.01). Endotoxin injured primarily the ileal and cecal mucosa and increased ileal and hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase and cecal oxidase activities (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that xanthine oxidase-induced mucosal damage plays a role in endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation.\r"

This paper reviews the intricate interrelationship between masculinity and both social and alcoholic drinking. A large body of evidence indicates that social drinking is a primary cultural symbol of manliness; portrayals in the media strengthen this association. Less evidence exists to connect masculinity issues with alcoholic dependence, but there has been much speculation: Three psychodynamic theories of alcoholism--the repressed homosexuality, dependency, and power theories--hypothesized that men who drink addictively have the most fragile masculine identities. The 1980s have witnessed a widespread recognition of the dangers of equating drinking and manliness, and societal changes suggest that drinking may be gradually losing its masculine aura.\r"

  ".W": "Marijuana (Cannabis) dependence (addiction) is a disorder for which treatment is essential and relatively sophisticated. A basic assumption in the treatment model is that marijuana addiction involves pathological processes in the physical, mental (cognitive), and emotional (mood) states of the addicted individual. These pathological processes constitute a disease entity that is diagnosable, treatable, and has a predictable course. One approach for the treatment of marijuana addiction involves physicians, psychologists, counselors, and social workers who treat the disease of marijuana addiction. We present this approach to treatment of marijuana addiction as representative of a popular method but not as the only modality available.\r"

Increased health care rationing in the next decade is inevitable, yet it must not be done with quick fixes, short-term solutions, and patchwork reform of our present system. That would create worse problems for health care in the 21 st century and is clearly unacceptable. We recommend that President Bush appoint a blue-ribbon commission to study our present system in depth, then offer alternative solutions for its many problems. He should look closely at at least the following nine issues: controlling medical technology, instituting a resource-based relative value system for physician reimbursement, establishing an ongoing national medical ethics commission, instituting national malpractice reform, implementing universal medical coverage with Medicare/Medicaid reform, establishing a national health services research and planning institute, reducing the nation's health care facilities, reducing physician supply, and improving health promotion/disease prevention education.\r"

These methods include surgical or catheter ablation of abnormal foci. Current techniques involve catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction to control supraventricular arrhythmias. In addition, surgical techniques have proved to be remarkably safe and effective for treatment of patients with accessory pathways and those with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Patients with drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia may benefit from surgical resection of the ventricular tachycardia focus. The use of these interventional methodologies has radically altered the approach to management of patients with drug-refractory cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

  ".U": "90080595\r", 
  ".W": "Amino acids are reabsorbed from the tubular lumen by a saturable, carrier-mediated, concentrative transport mechanism driven by a Na+ electrochemical gradient across the luminal membrane. This process is followed by efflux mainly via carrier-mediated, Na+-independent facilitated diffusion across the basolateral membrane. Individual amino acids may have two or more Na+-dependent transport systems with different kinetic characteristics along the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule, thereby enabling very efficient amino acid reabsorption. Dual Na+-coupled transport pathways for some amino acids located in both the luminal and the peritubular membranes may operate in concert to provide the tubular epithelial cell with essential nutrients. One or more Na+ ions, H+, Cl- and in the case of acidic amino acids, K+ ion, may be involved in the translocation of the carrier complex. For most amino acids this process is electrogenic positive, favored by a negative cell interior. At least seven distinct, but largely interacting, Na+-dependent amino acid transport systems have been identified in the brush border membrane. A diet-induced adaptation in Na+-coupled taurine transport and acidosis-induced adaptive response in Na+-dependent glutamine transport are expressed at the luminal and the basolateral membrane surfaces, respectively. The aminoaciduria of early life may be related to a rapid dissipation of the Na+ electrochemical gradient necessary for amino acid reabsorption.\r"

Only recently, direct biochemical and cell-biological access has become possible by the use of established and primary cell cultures. Based on the results obtained with isolated brush border membranes and cultured cells, a model has been presented, which might serve as a basis for future research of the regulatory control mechanisms of the renal Na+/Pi cotransport. At present, a major drawback is the fact that the molecular identity of the Na+/Pi cotransport system is still unknown. The identification of this transport system would certainly be a great step and would allow to verify or falsify one or the other hypotheses postulated in the past few years for the regulatory control mechanism(s) of the renal Na+/Pi cotransport.\r"

  ".U": "90080601\r", 
  ".W": "The proximal tubule utilizes multiple mechanisms to reabsorb filtered NaCl. In the early PCT electrogenic Na-coupled organic solute transport generates a lumen-negative PD which drives Cl- passively through the paracellular pathway. Preferential reabsorption of HCO3- and organic solutes in the early PCT elevates luminal Cl- concentration, which in the late PCT provides the driving force for passive reabsorption of both Na+ and Cl-. However, most of the NaCl reabsorbed in the PCT is mediated by an electroneutral mechanism in which equivalent amounts of Na+ and Cl- move transcellularly across apical and basolateral membranes. In the mammalian PCT the evidence overwhelmingly supports parallel Na+-H+ and Cl- -base exchangers as the mechanism by which Na+ and Cl- cross the apical membrane during electroneutral, transcellular NaCl reabsorption. OH-, HCO3-, formate and Ox- have all been suggested to be the anion exchanged for Cl-. An important physiologic contribution of formate has been shown in in vitro microperfusion studies [29]. Measurements of intracellular pH using fluorescent dyes [59, 60] support a quantitatively important role for formate and argue against a large contribution of OH- and HCO3-. The absence of a role for HCO3- is also supported by in vivo microperfusion studies using methoxazolamide [53]. The potential role of oxalate requires physiologic evaluation. To date, the experimental data suggest that Cl- -formate is probably the predominant anion exchange mechanism. One may ask why, in a process so critical as NaCl reabsorption, the tubule would choose to use a \"toxin\" rather than one of those ions more familiar to renal physiologists?(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The KCl cotransporter in the basolateral membrane of renal tubules may play a central role in the transcellular transport of NaCl. Because this transporter is electrically neutral, and also functions in parallel to the electrogenic Na,K-ATPase, there is an imbalance in charge which must be expressed as a cationic current across the basolateral membrane. Therefore, other pathways must also function in the basolateral membrane which permit the conductive exit of K+ in addition to the electrically-neutral KCl cotransporter. Another functional role for the KCl cotransporter is manifest during the cell volume regulatory response to cell swelling. In this setting (regulatory volume decrease), it appears that both electrically-neutral and electrically-coupled KCl efflux pathways are acutely activated. Very little is known at present about the mechanisms of short and long term regulation of the KCl cotransporter. A major obstacle at this point is the lack of a suitable, potent (that is, microM range) specific inhibitor of this transporter. It also appears that the chloride transport systems in basolateral membrane vesicles may be greatly influenced by the precise details of the method of preparation. Once these experimental details are mastered, and a suitable high affinity inhibitor is identified, then the detailed characterization and identification of the KCl cotransporter can be undertaken.\r"

Three of the patients were male and two female. Four of these patients had been misdiagnosed as having primary liver cancer by sonography and CT scan. Our experience has shown that if the patient had a long clinical course, few clinical symptoms, good general condition, and a negative alpha-fetoprotein assay, if the tumor was well encapsulated and the liver presented without cirrhosis, the patients should be suspected of having inflammatory pseudotumor of liver. In this series, all five patients underwent hepatectomy. There were no complications after operation. Surgical resection should be considered as the main therapeutic method for inflammatory pseudotumor of liver. If the patient proves unsuitable for surgical treatment, steroid therapy should be the treatment of choice. In this paper 12 cases of inflammatory pseudotumor of liver reported in the literature are reviewed and discussed.\r"

A total of 129 patients underwent 198 FFB, of which 76% were in mechanically ventilated patients. FFB was done for diagnostic purposes in 87, for therapeutic purposes in 93, and for both reasons in 18. Of the 71 diagnostic FFB performed for cultures, 27 (38%) were positive but only 18 (25%) influenced patient management. An additional 25 FFB were helpful in making therapeutic decisions even though the cultures were negative. Ten of 13 FFB performed for evaluation of airways and 1 of 3 done for hemoptysis were helpful. Of the 90 FFB done because of retained secretions, 37 (41%) showed mucous plugs or significant secretions, but clinical improvement was noted in only 17 (19%). Overall, FFB contributed substantially to patient management in 82 of the 198 procedures (41%). Seven patients had transient complications, but no deaths occurred. We conclude that FFB is safe and can be helpful in the CCU setting.\r"

In most of these cases, no allergic cause is identified, and the cases are labeled \"idiopathic.\" Occasionally, a deficiency of the inhibitor of the first component of complement (C1INH) is discovered, which may be either hereditary or acquired. In comparison with the hereditary variant, the acquired deficiency of C1INH is extremely rare, approximately 40 cases having been reported to date. Measurement of the C1q subunit is the key to the differential diagnosis between hereditary and acquired deficiencies of C1INH--it is normal in the former and decreased in the latter. The acquired deficiency of C1INH is usually found in association with benign or malignant B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, and the angioedema responds to therapy with androgens. A subset of six patients with acquired C1INH deficiency has been reported recently; they had anti-C1INH autoantibodies, no evidence of an underlying disease, a benign course, and variable responses to therapy. Two new cases of angioedema in patients with acquired C1INH deficiency are described in this report. One patient had no evidence of an underlying disease 11 years after the onset of angioedema. The other case was associated with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that became evident 9 months after C1INH deficiency was diagnosed, and androgen therapy stopped the attacks of angioedema. In this second case, the functional activity of C1INH mirrored the clinical response to therapy.\r"

Each modality has advantages and disadvantages for various organ systems. High accuracy rates and low complication rates can be expected. Cost savings and rapid reporting of results add to the value of these procedures.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the clinical and laboratory features of eight children (median age, 20 months; range, 13 months to 11 years) with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (M7) and compared the findings with those reported in the literature. The diagnosis was supported by ultrastructural examination for platelet peroxidase or immunophenotyping for glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or the von Willebrand factor protein. Two patients had Down's syndrome. Initial findings included anemia (in all patients), thrombocytopenia (in six), myelofibrosis (in three), lytic bone lesions (in two), and pronounced leukocytosis (in one). Stem cell culture studies of peripheral blood specimens revealed an aberrant phenotype of the megakaryocytes in one patient and reversal to a normal pattern after successful therapy. Remission was achieved in seven of the eight patients after aggressive chemotherapy, and four patients remained in remission 27 to 57 months after diagnosis. Three of these four patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. M7 leukemia is not infrequent in children younger than 3 years of age, especially in those with Down's syndrome. The availability of monoclonal antibodies specific to restricted antigens of the megakaryocytic lineage has made the diagnosis of M7 leukemia both possible and practical.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a method termed PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of specific alleles (PASA), a generally applicable technique for detection of point mutations or polymorphisms. The ease and technical simplicity of PASA will make genetic analyses more accessible to the general medical community. In addition, PASA shows promise for population screening because the technique is rapid, highly reproducible, inexpensive, nonisotopic, and amenable to automation. PASA is a modification of PCR that depends on the synthesis of a PCR oligonucleotide primer that precisely matches with one of the alleles but mismatches with the other. When the mismatch occurs near the 3' end of the PCR primer, amplification is inefficient. Therefore, preferential amplification of the perfectly matched allele is obtained. We demonstrate the applicability of PASA by performing carrier detection in the family of a patient with phenylketonuria (PKU) and by screening a population of unrelated subjects for the presence of the two mutations most commonly associated with PKU. Multiple persons were screened simultaneously for the mutant alleles because a mutation could be detected in the presence of at least a 40-fold excess of the normal allele. The two PKU mutations could be detected concurrently by using a mixture of only three PCR primers, an indication that simultaneous screening of multiple mutations can be done even if three or more mutations are closely clustered. In addition to the detection of mutations, PASA can be used to detect polymorphic alleles rapidly and to distinguish pseudogenes or repetitive sequences that differ by as little as one base.\r"

The clinicopathologic features of this syndrome can vary considerably from patient to patient; no reliable diagnostic laboratory tests are available, and some of the treatment regimens are controversial. The pathogenesis of this condition is not well understood. An important factor is the role of the intestinal mucosal barrier in the regulation of uptake of dietary antigen from the intestinal tract. Recently, significant differences have been observed between the features of the immature newborn and the mature adult intestinal mucosal barriers. These findings may be of fundamental importance to the pathogenesis of food allergy and are currently an area of intense research.\r"

  ".W": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease in pediatric patients and is the leading cause of childhood disability. The functional abnormalities of this disease--namely, airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness--are consequences primarily of airway inflammation. Outpatient therapy for acute asthma, as well as therapy for status asthmaticus (episodes of asthma unresponsive to usually effective outpatient therapy and necessitating hospitalization), primarily addresses treatment of airway inflammation. The goal of office and emergency room management of acute asthma is reversal of airway obstruction by the administration of inhaled beta-adrenergic medications. The therapy for status asthmaticus consists of intravenously administered aminophylline, corticosteroids, nebulized beta-adrenergic agents, and oxygen. Respiratory failure, the inability to maintain adequate elimination of CO2, may be effectively treated by adding continuous nebulization of albuterol. Mechanical ventilation will still be necessary in the rare patient who does not respond to pharmacologic therapy. Acute exacerbations of asthma, as well as status asthmaticus, can best be prevented by establishing effective maintenance programs individualized for each patient.\r"

The utility of this measurement is limited, however, by the characteristic variability of blood pressure; office blood pressure readings are not always reliable indicators of pressures occurring throughout the course of the day. Therefore, blood pressure measurements performed by patients or family members at home and automatic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are two supplementary methods used in the clinical management of hypertension. In this article, the role of these methods in the diagnosis of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders as well as in the evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy is addressed.\r"

Genomic imprinting may have considerable implications for genetic counselling with respect to glomus tumours and also for the understanding of other hereditary diseases.\r"

Chloroquine reduced parasitaemia significantly more rapidly than did quinine, but other measures of the therapeutic response were similar in the two groups. Quinine injections were painful.

The responses to calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) were compared with those to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator prostacyclin (epoprostenol; PGI2). In the patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, CGRP induced flushing of the face and hands accompanied by a rise in skin blood flow, whereas in the controls CGRP caused flushing and increased blood flow only in the face. PGI2 caused similar rises in skin blood flow in the hands and face in both groups. ATP did not cause any significant changes in skin blood flow in the face or hands in the patients, but in the controls it increased skin blood flow in the face. Since the suprasensitivity to CGRP of skin blood flow in the hands of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon is not common to other vasodilators, it may reflect a deficiency of endogenous CGRP release in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the effect of a low-protein diet on the progression of renal disease 19 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with persistent clinical proteinuria were observed for 12-39 (mean 29) months while they were on a normal-protein diet (1.13 [0.06] g/kg per day), then for 12-49 (mean 33) months on a low-protein diet (0.67 [0.03] g/kg per day). The low-protein diet had no adverse effect on nutrition or glycosylated haemoglobin concentration. Mean supine blood pressure (BP) fell slightly on the low-protein diet and was probably due to the start or modification of antihypertensive medication in 9 patients. The mean rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate fell from 0.61 (SEM 0.14) ml/min per month with the normal-protein diet to 0.14 (0.08) with the low-protein diet, and this effect remained highly significant after adjustment for blood pressure, energy intake, and glycosylated haemoglobin. The rise in the fractional clearance of albumin during a normal-protein diet stopped with the low-protein diet, and there was a significant fall in albumin excretion from 467 (95% CI 234-895) micrograms/24 h on the normal-protein to 340 (138-719) on the low-protein diet. Thus, a low-protein diet, with its reduction in protein and possibly other dietary components such as phosphate or fat, seems to retard the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate in diabetic nephropathy independently of blood pressure changes and glycaemic control.\r"

Liver biopsy specimens were also examined for lipid A, a common antigenic component of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria. In all stool samples from the 21 patients with PBC Escherichia coli R-forms constituted up to half of the total amount of E coli. In contrast E coli R-forms were detectable in the stools of only 1 healthy control (n = 20), and in 25% of patients with other cholestatic diseases (n = 10), chronic hepatitis type B (n = 15), type non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 15), or chronic pancreatitis and fat malabsorption (n = 8). An immunoblot technique showed that E coli R-forms isolated from patients' stools contained PBC-specific AMA-reactive proteins with molecular weights of 70-80 kD and 50 kD. Deposits of lipid A, located primarily in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, were found in 11 patients with PBC but not in the liver of patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Circulating antibodies against lipid A were found rarely and in low titres. The data support the hypothesis that intestinal enterobacterial R-forms are aetiologically important in PBC and that antigens released from the bacterial cell wall contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

To determine respiratory cricothyroid muscle activity in conscious humans, cricothyroid muscle electromyogram was measured percutaneously, along with posterior cricoarytenoid muscle electromyogram and esophageal pressure in six volunteers. Low level cricothyroid muscle activity with quiet breathing was observed in four subjects. In all subjects, cricothyroid muscle activity was recruited by voluntary deep breathing, brief airway occlusion, and hypercapnia. Continuous positive airway pressure at 7.5-cm H2O increased expiratory cricothyroid muscle activity in all subjects, and suppressed inspiratory activity in five. These results indicate that respiratory reflexes of the cricothyroid muscle are operative in conscious humans.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether rimantadine can protect family members from acquiring influenza A viral illness and to assess the possible selection of drug-resistant strains of virus, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in three communities during two influenza seasons. When influenza A occurred in a family, the members (including the index patient) were given either rimantadine (adult oral dose, 200 mg per day) or placebo for 10 days. The presence of illness was monitored by daily recording of symptoms and temperature measurements; infection was determined by isolation of the virus and by serologic studies. Among households with documented influenza A infections, symptomatic illness occurred in one or more contacts in 10 of 28 families treated with rimantadine and in 10 of 209 families treated with placebo. Asymptomatic secondary influenza A infections were found in five families assigned to receive rimantadine and in four families assigned to receive placebo. Rimantadine-resistant strains of influenza A virus (H3N2 subtype) with mutations consisting of single amino acid changes in the M2 protein (residue 27, 30, or 31) were recovered from eight index patients and five contacts treated with rimantadine. There was apparent transmission of drug-resistant strains of virus in six contacts with secondary illnesses in five families. We conclude that when index patients are treated concurrently, rimantadine is ineffective in protecting household members from influenza A infection. If rimantadine is used for both treatment and postexposure prophylaxis in families, rapid selection and apparent transmission of drug-resistant influenza A viruses can occur.\r"

Dexamethasone, commonly used to treat cerebral edema due to other causes, also reduces the symptoms of acute mountain sickness when given prophylactically. However, the efficacy of dexamethasone in the treatment of established acute mountain sickness remains uncertain. To investigate this question, we exposed six men in a hypobaric chamber to a simulated altitude of 3700 m (barometric pressure, 64 kPa [481 mm Hg]) for 48 hours on two occasions. Acute mountain sickness was diagnosed with use of a symptoms questionnaire, and dexamethasone (4 mg every six hours) or placebo was then given in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Dexamethasone reduced the symptoms of acute mountain sickness by 63 percent (P less than 0.05), whereas placebo had a minimal effect (reduction by 23 percent; P not significant). In spite of this response, one subject had mild cerebral edema on brain CT after both placebo and dexamethasone. Dexamethasone had no effect on fluid shifts, oxygenation, sleep apnea, urinary catecholamine levels, the appearance of chest radiographs or perfusion scans, serum electrolyte levels, hematologic profiles, or the results of psychometric tests. Dexamethasone treatment was complicated by mild hyperglycemia in all subjects (mean [+/- SE] glucose level, 7.3 +/- 1.3 mmol per liter [132 +/- 23 mg per deciliter]). We conclude that dexamethasone effectively reduces the symptoms of acute mountain sickness. However, it did not improve objective physiologic abnormalities related to exposure to high altitudes. We therefore recommend that dexamethasone be used only when descent is impossible, or to facilitate cooperation in evacuation efforts.\r"

  ".U": "90081779\r", 
  ".W": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we studied the effects of six months of growth hormone replacement in 24 adults with growth hormone deficiency. Most of the patients had acquired growth hormone deficiency during adulthood as a consequence of treatment for pituitary tumors, and all were receiving appropriate thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal hormone replacement. The daily dose of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was 0.07 U per kilogram of body weight, given subcutaneously at bedtime. The mean (+/- SE) plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor I increased from 0.41 +/- 0.05 to 1.53 +/- 0.16 U per liter during rhGH treatment. Treatment with rhGH had no effect on body weight. The mean lean body mass, however, increased by 5.5 +/- 1.1 kg (P less than 0.0001), and the fat mass decreased by 5.7 +/- 0.9 kg (P less than 0.0001) in the group treated with growth hormone; neither changed significantly in the placebo group. The basal metabolic rate, measured at base line and after one and six months of rhGH administration, increased significantly; the respective values were 32.4 +/- 1.4, 37.2 +/- 2.2, and 34.4 +/- 1.6 kcal per kilogram of lean body mass per day (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). Fasting plasma cholesterol levels were lower (P less than 0.05) in the rhGH-treated group than in the placebo group, whereas plasma triglyceride values were similar in the two groups throughout the study. We conclude that growth hormone has a role in the regulation of body composition in adults, probably through its anabolic and lipolytic actions.\r"

The women were at lower-than-average risk of a poor outcome of pregnancy, according to many but not all of the recognized demographic and behavioral risk factors. Among the women, 70.7 percent had only minor complications or none; 7.9 percent had serious emergency complications during labor and delivery or soon thereafter, such as thick meconium or severe shoulder dystocia. One woman in six (15.8 percent) was transferred to a hospital; 2.4 percent had emergency transfers. Twenty-nine percent of nulliparous women and only 7 percent of parous women were transferred, but the frequency of emergency transfers was the same. The rate of cesarean section was 4.4 percent. There were no maternal deaths. The overall intrapartum and neonatal mortality rate was 1.3 per 1000 births. The rates of infant mortality and low Apgar scores were similar to those reported in large studies of low-risk hospital births. We conclude that birth centers offer a safe and acceptable alternative to hospital confinement for selected pregnant women, particularly those who have previously had children, and that such care leads to relatively few cesarean sections.\r"

  ".U": "90081840\r", 
  ".W": "Excitatory amino acids (EAAs) are important neurotransmitters in the vertebrate central nervous system. Electrophysiological and ligand-binding studies indicate that at least three different receptor subtypes for EAAs exist--N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate and quisqualate receptor subtypes--on the basis of the preferred agonist of the receptors. We recently purified a kainate-binding protein (KBP) from frog (Rana pipiens berlandieri) brain by domoic acid (a high-affinity kainate analogue) affinity chromatography, and showed that the kainate-binding activity was associated with a protein of relative molecular mass 48,000 (Mr 48 K). The pharmacological properties and the anatomical distribution of KBP were consistent with those of a kainate receptor-ionophore complex. We have now isolated a complementary DNA encoding KBP of Mr 48 K. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the KBP has similar hydrophobic profiles to those found in other ligand-gated ion channel subunits, and shows some amino-acid sequence similarities to the corresponding regions of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. Localization of the KBP messenger RNAs by in situ hybridization histochemistry is compatible with the results of immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography studies. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the KBP show high-affinity kainate-binding activity with pharmacological properties similar to those of the biochemically purified KBP. These results provide the first molecular characterization of an EAA-binding site and raise the possibility that the KBP cDNA encodes a ligand-binding subunit of a kainate receptor-ionophore complex.\r"

  ".W": "Kainate receptors mediate some of the excitatory transactions carried out in the central nervous system by the neurotransmitter glutamate. They are involved in neurotoxicity, possibly in neurodegenerative disorders and it has been suggested that they have a role in long-term potentiation. Kainate receptors are present both on neuronal and glial cell membranes where they regulate the gating of a voltage-independent ion channel. Nothing is known about their molecular structure. Taking advantage of the unusually high abundance of 3H-kainate binding sites in the chick cerebellum, we have isolated an oligomeric protein that displays a pharmacological profile similar to that of a kainate receptor, and have demonstrated, using the monoclonal antibody IX-50, that this protein is composed of a single polypeptide of Mr 49,000 which harbours the specific kainate recognition site. The structure of this kainate binding protein (KBP) is also of interest because of its exclusive cerebellar localization on Bergmann glial membrane in close proximity to established glutamatergic synapses. We now report the isolation of the complementary DNA containing the complete coding region of the kainate binding protein. The predicted structure of the mature protein has four putative transmembrane domains with a topology analogous to that found in the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. This raises the possibility, that kainate binding protein may form part of an ion channel and may be a subunit of a kainate subtype of glutamate receptor.\r"

The CSF-1 receptor belongs to a family of ligand-activated protein-tyrosine kinases. Activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, but not the CSF-1 receptor, leads to an increase in phospholipase C activity and a subsequent elevation in intracellular calcium. Recent studies have shown that a novel phosphoinositol (PtdIns) kinase, termed PtdIns-3 kinase, is stimulated by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and certain oncogenes in the protein-tyrosine kinase family. PtdIns-3 kinase phosphorylates the D-3 hydroxyl position of the inositol ring of PtdIns, and its products do not participate in the generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Here we report that addition of CSF-1 is followed by activation of PtdIns-3 kinase in a macrophage cell line (P388 D1), which contains CSF-1 receptors, and in BALB/c fibroblasts made to express the human CSF-1 receptor. Furthermore, we show that activation of the CSF-1 receptor results in the accumulation in intact cells of polyphosphoinositides phosphorylated at the D-3 position of the inositol ring. Thus activation of the CSF-1 receptor stimulates PtdIns-3 kinase activity, indicating a novel pathway for CSF-1 receptor-mediated signal transduction.\r"

Ras proteins (p21ras) have been implicated in signal transduction pathways used by several growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These guanine nucleotide-binding Ras proteins specifically interact with a cellular GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Here we report that in intact quiescent fibroblasts, both AA and BB homodimers of PDGF rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP under conditions in which insulin and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are ineffective. Although GAP is located predominantly in the cytosol, most tyrosine-phosphorylated GAP is associated with the cell membrane, the site of p21ras biological activity. These results provide a direct biochemical link between activated PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinases and the p21ras-GAP mitogenic signalling system.\r"

  ".U": "90081879\r", 
  ".W": "Membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, which involves the budding and fusion of carrier vesicles, is inhibited during mitosis in animal cells. At the same time, the Golgi complex and the nuclear envelope, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum in some cell types, become fragmented. Fragmentation of the Golgi is believed to facilitate its equal partitioning between daughter cells. In fact, it has been postulated that both the inhibition of membrane traffic and Golgi fragmentation during mitosis are due to an inhibition of vesicle fusion, while vesicle budding continues. Although less is known about the endocytic pathway, internalization and receptor recycling are also arrested during mitosis. We have now used a cell-free assay to show that the fusion of endocytic vesicles from baby hamster kidney cells is reduced in Xenopus mitotic cytosol when compared with interphase cytosol. We reconstituted this inhibition in interphase cytosol by adding a preparation enriched in the starfish homologue of the cdc2 protein kinase. Inhibition was greater than or equal to 90% when the added cdc2 activity was in the range estimated for that in mitotic Xenopus eggs, which indicates that during mitosis the cdc2 kinase mediates an inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion, and possibly other fusion events in membrane traffic.\r"

  ".U": "90081883\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporin A, a cyclic fungal undecapeptide produced by Tolypocladium inflatum, is a potent immunosuppressive drug originally isolated as an antifungal antibiotic. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is widely used in humans to prevent rejection of transplanted organs such as kidney, heart, bone marrow and liver. The biochemical basis of CsA action is not known: its primary cellular target has been suggested to be calmodulin, the prolactin receptor or cyclophilin, a CsA-binding protein originally isolated from the cytosol of bovine thymocytes. Cyclophilin has been shown to be a highly conserved protein present in all eukaryotic cells tested and to be identical to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, a novel type of enzyme that accelerates the slow refolding phase of certain proteins in vitro. We demonstrate that in the lower eukaryotes N. crassa and S. cerevisiae, cyclo philin mediates the cytotoxic CsA effect. In CsA-resistant mutants of both organisms, the cyclophilin protein is either lost completely or, if present, has lost its ability to bind CsA.\r"

There is a commonality between various STDs that results in people frequently harboring one or more agent. In view of this, efforts should be made to evaluate patients for inapparent disease. Another important aspect is recognizing that patients do not acquire their infection except through sexual contact, indicating that another person is involved. Therefore, for control purposes, treatment of all sexual contacts also must be addressed.\r"

Physicians must understand that the psychologic impact of genital HSV infections frequently is more disabling than the physical manifestations. Sensitivity, compassion, and support are necessary from members of the medical community, and psychologic counseling may help patients cope with HSV and all its implications. Similarly, physicians must downplay the hysteria that has been associated with herpesvirus infections, emerging as a result of intense media coverage in the 1970s and 1980s. Minimizing the number of cases of neonatal herpes through identification of infected women during parturition continues to be important. Recent guidelines suggest a rationale for the management of women at risk for genital HSV. Nevertheless, until newer immunologic and serologic techniques become clinically reliable and allow a correct and rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex infection, identification of the infected woman in labor must be made using detailed clinical history, physical examination, and viral culture.\r"

Without stronger evidence supporting a causal role for HPV in the development of genital tract and anal cancers, and without the availability of effective therapies, it is premature to recommend widespread screening for detection of HPV DNA or RNA with the molecular hybridization tests soon to be available commercially. Papanicolaou smear screening for detection of early precancerous changes of the cervix and referral for colposcopy and biopsy of areas of epithelium that are suspicious for intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, or anus remain the cornerstones of genital tract and anal cancer prevention. The patient care implications of subclinical persistent HPV infection of the genital tract are not well understood. For this reason, and because none of the available therapies are curative, treatment of large areas of normal-appearing genital tract epithelium also cannot be recommended at this time. It is hoped that, with the growing research focus on therapies that have the potential for virologic cure, some day effective treatment for subclinical infection will be available. Until that time, patients with recalcitrant or recurring genital warts may benefit most by the sequential application of different treatment modalities.\r"

Favorable clinical response was achieved in 98 of 100 patients judged evaluable for efficacy. Adverse effects were generally mild and reversible and included diarrhea alone or with vomiting (5.1%), irritation of intravenous infusion site (3.3%) and rash (2.2%). Changes in laboratory test values reported most frequently were thrombocytosis (8.9%), elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (7.9%) and alanine aminotransferase (5.6%) and eosinophilia (8.4%). This safety profile appears to be comparable to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moreover imipenem-cilastatin was effective in infections caused by a broad spectrum of pathogens that include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and anaerobes. These attributes suggest that imipenem-cilastatin should be safe and effective in selected pediatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "Random-sequence or highly degenerate oligonucleotides have been useful for defining functionally important sequences both in proteins and in nucleic acids. In this approach, such oligonucleotides are used to replace a segment of DNA required for a desired function, and functional sequences are identified by an appropriate genetic or biochemical selection. Here, a collection of 10(5) altered beta-lactamase proteins was generated by cloning a mixed-base oligonucleotide in place of the sequences coding for a 17-amino acid portion of the enzyme's active site. Approximately 2000 enzymes from this collection were able to confer ampicillin resistance on Escherichia coli. Fifty-eight of these were chosen for further study after characterization with various beta-lactam substrates. beta-Lactamases having altered specificity against different antibiotics, resistance to the suicide inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam, and temperature-dependent activities were obtained. The amino acid residues responsible for these altered properties as well as for basic enzyme activity are defined. This approach should prove to be an effective and general tool for creating proteins with novel properties, especially in situations in which a high-resolution structure of the protein is not known.\r"

Replication was severely impeded by ter in a unique orientation when purified TBP was supplied to bind it. The target for blockage within the replication complex can now be ascribed to the inability of dnaB helicase to separate the duplex strands when it encounters ter bound by TBP. Other helicases, such as rep and uvrD proteins, that translocate on DNA and displace strands in the direction opposite to that of dnaB protein are also blocked, but only when the TBP-bound ter is oriented in the other direction. From these results, we infer that the orientation of ter confers a particular polarity on the TBP seated on it, such that a helicase is blocked when it confronts TBP from one side, but can act, presumably by displacing TBP, when facing its other side. Thus, the intrinsic nature of the oriented TBP-ter complex is responsible for impeding the helicases, rather than any protein-protein interactions.\r"

Silk moth tissue culture cells infected with these recombinant viruses were found to contain abundant RNA sequences of sizes similar to those of the authentic chorion mRNAs. Chorion transcripts present in infected cells were initiated almost exclusively at the cap site of the polyhedrin start site. Primer extension and RNase protection experiments revealed that a considerable proportion of the resultant transcripts were spliced at the same sites as those utilized in follicular cells for the production of functional chorion mRNA. Electrophoretic analysis and immunoprecipitation of the proteins of host cells infected with the recombinant viruses revealed the presence of the corresponding chorion proteins. We conclude that baculovirus vectors can be used for expressing efficiently not only cDNAs or simple genes devoid of intervening sequences but also intron-containing chromosomal genes. Thus, recombinant baculoviruses offer a powerful alternative to hybrid-selected translation, particularly when the identification of proteins encoded by members of complex multigene families is required.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the energy requirement for maltose transport in right-side-out membrane vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. When membrane vesicles were made from strains producing tethered maltose-binding proteins by dilution of spheroplasts into phosphate buffer, those from an F0F1 ATPase-containing (unc+) strain transported maltose in the presence of an exogenous electron donor, such as ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate, at a rate of 1-5 nmol/min per mg of protein, whereas those from an isogenic unc- strain failed to transport maltose. Transport in vesicles obtained from the latter strain could be restored in the presence of electron donors if the vesicles were made to contain NAD+ and either ATP or an ATP-regenerating system. ATP hydrolysis was apparently required for transport, since nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues did not sustain transport. Maltose transport significantly increased ATP hydrolysis in ATP-containing vesicles from unc- cells. Finally, ATP-containing vesicles from unc- strains producing normal maltose-binding proteins could accumulate maltose in the absence of electron donors. These results provide convincing evidence that it is the hydrolysis of ATP that drives maltose transport, and probably also other periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport systems.\r"

  ".W": "Short catalytic RNAs possessing specific endoribonuclease activity (ribozymes) have recently been designed that can potentially shear any chosen target RNA in trans at a specific site. Here, engineered ribozymes targeted against chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), derived from Tn9, have been cloned into a mammalian expression vector and tested in transient transfection experiments for their effects on CAT expression in monkey (COS1) cells. The ribozymes contained the catalytic domain of the satellite RNA from tobacco ringspot virus and were targeted to three sites in the CAT mRNA by flanking antisense sequences. These ribozymes, which were previously shown to accurately cleave CAT message in vitro, were cloned into a replicating plasmid vector under the control of the highly active simian virus 40 early promoter. The ribozyme gene sequence was incorporated into the 3' untranslated region of the gene for firefly luciferase as it was ineffective when expressed as a short RNA. Each ribozyme construction gave a similar level of suppression of CAT activity when the target was transcribed from the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter. One of the three (ribozyme 2) was chosen for further study and tested after it had been modified by the addition of extra flanking bases. The reporter gene for luciferase was used to monitor ribozyme level and to function as a specificity control, and the human growth hormone gene was cotransfected as an independent reporter for specificity of the ribozyme against the intended target CAT. At high (approximately 1000-fold) molar excess this ribozyme was demonstrated to consistently and specifically suppress CAT expression (up to approximately 60%) in COS1 cells relative both to a plasmid clone with the ribozyme inserted in the reversed (inactive) orientation and to a control corresponding to the relevant 26-nucleotide antisense segment of CAT.\r"

To study the biosynthesis and assembly of CD4, wild-type and glycosylation-deficient mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cotransfected with a cDNA encoding CD4 and a cDNA for the human multiple drug resistance gene, which allowed the amplification of the transfected CD4 cDNA sequences. Clones were isolated that exhibited high-level expression of CD4 resulting from the integration of several copies of CD4 cDNA. CD4 synthesized by these cells acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H after 20-30 min of chase, suggesting a rapid translocation of the glycoprotein from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi apparatus. The sensitivity of CD4 to glycosidases suggested the presence of biantennary unsialylated complex-type oligosaccharides. Consistent with this, CD4 synthesized by the Lec2 mutant, which does not add sialic acid to oligosaccharides, was identical to the glycoprotein produced by wild-type CHO cells. The amplification strategy used to express CD4 at high levels in wild-type and mutant CHO cells will have general utility.\r"

It was mapped to human chromosome 12q13 and was shown to be expressed as a 6.2-kilobase transcript in a variety of normal tissues of epithelial origin. Markedly elevated ERBB3 mRNA levels were demonstrated in certain human mammary tumor cell lines. These findings suggest that increased ERBB3 expression, as in the case of epidermal growth factor receptor and ERBB2, may play a role in some human malignancies.\r"

We now present evidence that this modulation of folding plays a role during the export of maltose-binding protein in vivo. Maltose-binding protein synthesized in vivo without a leader sequence did not engage the cellular export apparatus. However, the requirement for the leader in at least one step, that of binding the export factor SecB, could be overcome by an amino acid substitution in the mature portion of maltose-binding protein. This substitution retarded the folding of the polypeptide even in the absence of a leader. Investigations using purified proteins in vitro demonstrated that SecB would stably bind to species of maltose-binding protein devoid of a leader when the folding of the binding proteins was sufficiently slow. Thus, we conclude that one of the roles of the leader is to retard folding and expose the binding site for SecB.\r"

To examine the generality with which substrate specificity can be altered, six variant catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) have been produced with two- or three-base changes in the active site.

DpnA was able to methylate single-strand DNA and double-strand DNA, whereas DpnM methylated only double-strand DNA. Although both enzymes act at 5'-GATC-3' in DNA, DpnA can also methylate sequences altered in the guanine position, but at a lower rate. A deletion mutation in the dpnA gene was constructed and transferred to the chromosome. Transmission by way of the transformation pathway of methylated and unmethylated plasmids to dpnA mutant and wild-type recipients was examined. The mutant cells restricted unmethylated donor plasmid establishment much more strongly than did wild-type cells. In the wild type, the single strands of donor plasmid DNA that enter by the transformation pathway are apparently methylated by DpnA prior to conversion of the plasmid to a double-strand form, in which the plasmid would be susceptible to the Dpn II endonuclease. The biological function of DpnA may, therefore, be the enhancement of plasmid transfer to Dpn II-containing strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae.\r"

  ".U": "90083241\r", 
  ".W": "Above pH 8 the decay of the photocycle intermediate M of bacteriorhodopsin splits into two components: the usual millisecond pH-independent component and an additional slower component with a rate constant proportional to the molar concentration of H+, [H+]. In parallel, the charge translocation signal associated with the reprotonation of the Schiff base develops a similar slow component. These observations are explained by a two-step reprotonation mechanism. An internal donor first reprotonates the Schiff base in the decay of M to N and is then reprotonated from the cytoplasm in the N----O transition. The decay rate of N is proportional to [H+]. By postulating a back reaction from N to M, the M decay splits up into two components, with the slower one having the same pH dependence as the decay of N. Photocycle, photovoltage, and pH-indicator experiments with mutants in which aspartic acid-96 is replaced by asparagine or alanine, which we call D96N and D96A, suggest that Asp-96 is the internal proton donor involved in the re-uptake pathway. In both mutants the stoichiometry of proton pumping is the same as in wild type. However, the M decay is monophasic, with the logarithm of the decay time [log (tau)] linearly dependent on pH, suggesting that the internal donor is absent and that the Schiff base is directly reprotonated from the cytoplasm. Like H+, azide increases the M decay rate in D96N. The rate constant is proportional to the azide concentration and can become greater than 100 times greater than in wild type. Thus, azide functions as a mobile proton donor directly reprotonating the Schiff base in a bimolecular reaction. Both the proton and azide effects, which are absent in wild type, indicate that the internal donor is removed and that the reprotonation pathway is different from wild type in these mutants.\r"

When CHO-K1 cells are incubated in M-F12 without insulin for 48-72 hr, the cells accumulate in G1. In response to physiological concentrations of insulin an 18-fold increase in rate of DNA synthesis occurs due to cells entering S phase after an 8- to 10-hr lag; cell division begins after 24 hr. The inhibitory effect of actinomycin D and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside indicates that RNA synthesis is required for progression to S phase. CHO-K1 cells possess insulin receptors, and the insulin effect results from insulin binding to its own receptor: (i) Binding occurs at physiological insulin concentrations with a half-maximal stimulation at approximately 14 ng/ml. (ii) At insulin concentrations used, insulin-like growth factor I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) have little or no effect. (iii) Scatchard analysis of 125I-labeled insulin binding shows the curvilinear response typical of insulin. (iv) The Kd for the so-called high-affinity binding site and the Ke are characteristic of the insulin receptor. (v) At the minimal insulin concentrations that stimulate growth, IGF-I and IGF-II compete poorly with insulin for insulin binding, insulin competes poorly with IGF-I for IGF-I binding, and affinity labeling with 125I-labeled insulin identifies a polypeptide (Mr = 125,000) typical of the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies against this protein have been induced and have revealed its restriction to the centromeres and to a limited number of other bands in the salivary gland chromosomes. Indirect immunofluorescence of the somatically paired homologous chromosomes of F1 hybrids indicates that the difference between the two subspecies in H1 I-1 content largely depends on differences situated at a number of distinct homologous chromosome bands. These bands were intensely decorated by antibodies against H1 I-1 in C. th. thummi but appeared virtually black in C. th. piger. The same bands, however, were decorated equally in both subspecies by an antibody that reacts with other H1 variants but does not recognize H1 I-1 and by a polyclonal anti-H1 antibody. The results suggest that H1 variant I-1 is characteristic of a specific type of chromatin that is confined to distinct chromosome segments and that is more frequent in the subspecies C. th. thummi, which has a 27% larger genome.\r"

When we examined the ability of hematopoietic growth factors to inhibit 125I-labeled KW-2228 binding, we found that KW-2228 and intact human G-CSF inhibited 125I-labeled KW-2228 binding, whereas erythropoietin or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not. Scatchard analysis revealed a single receptor type with a Bmax of 210 fmol/mg of protein and a Kd of 480 pM. The human G-CSF receptors on human placental membranes were shown to consist of two molecular species of 150 kDa and 120 kDa that could be specifically cross-linked to 125I-labeled KW-2228. Human trophoblastic cells, T3M-3, also possessed a single receptor for G-CSF with a Bmax of 533 receptors per cell and a Kd of 390 pM. Thus we have identified the receptor for human G-CSF on human placental membranes and trophoblastic cells, and the presence of this receptor in these membranes suggests that human G-CSF plays some role in the feto-placental unit during human development.\r"

To prepare monoclonal antibodies recognizing other, less immunogenic stage-specific embryonic epitopes, we used embryoglycan-negative embryonal carcinoma cells P19XT.1.1 as immunogen. One monoclonal antibody prepared by this strategy was found to react specifically with mouse embryonal carcinoma and embryo-derived stem cell lines. The target epitope, TEC-4, was found to be expressed on eggs and two-cell embryos but was undetectable on later stages of mouse embryos and adult mouse tissues. NaDodSO4/PAGE of immunoaffinity-isolated antigen revealed that TEC-4 epitope is associated with glycoproteins of apparent Mr 120,000 and 240,000. The epitope was resistant to oxidation by sodium periodate and to digestion by endoglycosidase F but was sensitive to treatment with protein-denaturing agents and proteases, which suggested that the epitope is located in the protein moiety of the molecule. In the course of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells the epitope disappeared before the onset of morphological differentiation. The combined data indicate that TEC-4 is an unusual stage-specific embryonic antigen that may be amenable to direct genetic analysis.\r"

  ".U": "90083266\r", 
  ".W": "We discovered the presence of an Alu and an Xba repetitive DNA element within introns 4 and 7, respectively, of the human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene; these elements are absent from the same gene in the gorilla. The Alu element is flanked by 12-base-pair direct repeats, AGGATGTTGTGG ... (Alu) ... AGGATGTTGTGG, which presumably arose by way of duplication of the intronic target site AGGATGTTGTGG at the time of the Alu insertion. In the gorilla, only a single copy of the unoccupied target site is present, which is identical to the terminal repeat flanking the human Alu element. There are two copies of an Xba repeat in the human AFP gene, apparently the only two in the genome. Xba1 and Xba2, located within introns 8 and 7, respectively, differ from each other at 3 of 303 positions. Xba1 is referred to as the old (ancestral) repeat because it lacks direct repeats. The new (derived) Xba2 is flanked by direct repeats, TTTCTTTTT ... (Xba) ... TTTCTTCTT, and is thought to have arisen as a result of transposition of Xba1. The ancestral Xba1 and a single copy of the Xba2 target site are present at orthologous positions in the gorilla, but the new Xba2 is absent. We conclude that the Alu and Xba DNA repeats emerged in the human genome at a time postdating the human-gorilla divergence and became established as genetic novelties in the human lineage. We submit that the chronology of divergence of primate lines of evolution can be correlated with the timing of insertion of new DNA repeats into the genomes of those primates.\r"

  ".W": "The demonstration of enzymatic capabilities of certain RNAs, in addition to their well-known template properties, has led to the recognition that RNAs are the only biological macromolecules that can function both as genotype and phenotype, hence raising the possibility of Darwinian selection and precellular evolution at the RNA level in the absence of DNA or protein. Recent models of such precellular RNA systems are patterned after the properties of intron-derived ribozymes. On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis and known properties of certain small plant pathogenic RNAs (viroids and viroid-like satellite RNAs), I suggest that these plant RNAs are more plausible candidates than introns as \"living fossils\" of a precellular RNA world. Their small size and circularity would have enhanced probability of their survival in error-prone, primitive self-replicating RNA systems and assured complete replication without the need for initiation or termination signals. All of these RNAs possess efficient mechanisms for the precise cleavage of monomers from oligomeric replication intermediates. Some (most viroids) require a host factor, but others (viroid-like satellite RNAs and one viroid) function as self-cleaving RNA enzymes far smaller and simpler than those derived from introns. The question is raised whether introns could have evolved from viroids or viroid-like satellite RNAs rather than vice versa, as has been widely speculated.\r"

These constructions were then introduced into tobacco protoplasts derived from plants previously transformed with Ac. The ability of each deletion derivative to excise was measured by whether or not kanamycin-resistant tobacco calli were recovered. This allowed us to determine the length of DNA present at each terminus that is required to respond to the products expressed by the Ac element present in the genome. We show that around 200 base pairs (bp) are required at both ends for excision to occur at wild-type levels. When between 100 and 200 bp were retained at one of the ends, reduced frequencies of excision were detected. With less than 100 bp remaining at either end, no excision was detected. In addition, we show that although similar lengths of DNA are required at each terminus, the termini are not interchangeable. The significance of these data is discussed with respect to the protein(s) which interact(s) with the termini of Ac.\r"

Previous studies described the relationship between tumorigenicity and one marker for genomic fluidity, gene amplification. In this report, these studies are extended with the rat liver epithelial cell lines to show that: (i) the amplification in these cells arises in a spontaneous fashion in the population (i.e., the variants detected are not preexisting in the population), and (ii) the rate of spontaneous amplification (mutation), as measured by Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analysis, is significantly lower in the nontumorigenic cells than in the tumorigenic cells. The rate was estimated by using the Po method and the method of means. The rate of spontaneous amplification of the gene encoding the multifunctional protein CAD (containing the enzymatic activities carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) in the highly tumorigenic cells was significantly greater than that for the nontumorigenic cells, reaching almost 1 x 10(-4) events per cell per generation. The rate of this mutagenic event is high compared to the rate of point mutations usually reported in mammalian cells, and its potential contribution to the tumorigenic process will be discussed.\r"

Additionally, the fate of neutrophils labeled with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime was observed following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor infusion. Proliferation increased in all stages of granulopoiesis, but a significant amount of the increased production stemmed from a greater input to the myeloblast compartment. Changes in the myelogram combined with the increased labeling indicated a faster throughput of cells, which resulted in labeled cells appearing in the circulation within 1 day compared to the normal 4 or 5 days. The 99mTc studies demonstrated no sequestration of circulating neutrophils by spleen, lungs, or liver. The half-life of the circulating neutrophils was not significantly changed, and calculations from the flow of labeled cells to the peripheral blood indicated an increase of 3.2 extra amplification divisions during neutrophil development. The dramatic neutrophil response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can therefore be accommodated by a relatively modest increase in granulopoietic activity.\r"

In this study, we have generated seven HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones from the peripheral blood of two seropositive subjects. Epitopes recognized by these CTL clones were identified by using target cells infected with recombinant HIV-1-vaccinia virus vectors expressing truncated reverse transcriptase proteins and further defined by using target cells incubated with overlapping 25-amino acid synthetic reverse transcriptase peptides. Five different CTL epitopes were identified, and in each case recognition was restricted by class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Clones maintained specific cytolytic function in continuous culture for up to 11 months, requiring only periodic restimulation with a CD3-specific monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that HIV-1-specific, major histocompatibility class I-restricted CTL recognize multiple epitopes of a single viral gene product in conjunction with different host HLA antigens. In addition, they demonstrate that human virus-specific CTL can be grown in long-term culture without the need for reexposure to viral antigen.\r"

These peptides elicited a slow-onset, long-lasting pulmonary vasoconstriction similar to the effect of endothelin, an endothelial-derived 21-amino acid vasoconstrictor peptide previously isolated from cells in culture. One of the isolated peptides coelutes with endothelin upon reverse-phase HPLC with an acetonitrile gradient and has a molecular weight comparable to endothelin as determined by gel-permeation HPLC. The other vasoconstrictor peptide elutes earlier than endothelin on reverse-phase HPLC and exhibits a lower molecular weight. The studies show the release of endothelin-like pulmonary vasoconstrictor peptides in the intact lung by alpha-thrombin, a central regulatory enzyme in hemostasis.\r"

The ability of this molecule to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in cells expressing the surface envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) suggested this molecule may be useful in treating infected individuals. To further evaluate its therapeutic potential, several in vitro properties of this hybrid toxin were examined. CD4(178)-PE40 was found to be an extremely potent cytotoxic agent, selectively killing HIV-infected cells with IC50 values around 100 pM. In a coculture system employing mixtures of HIV-infected and -uninfected cells, the hybrid toxin inhibited spread of the infection, as judged by a delay in HIV-induced cell killing and a dramatic suppression of free virus production. Experiments with control recombinant proteins indicated that this protective effect was primarily due to selective killing of the HIV-infected cells, rather than to a simple blocking effect of the CD4 moiety of the hybrid toxin. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses as expression vectors, we found the hybrid toxin to be active against cells expressing the envelope glycoproteins of divergent isolates of HIV-1, as well as HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. These results provide further support for the therapeutic potential of CD4(178)-PE40 in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals.\r"

We have compared two isogenic HIV-1 (HIV-1-WI3) strains, one of which lacks nef expression, and found little difference between them in in vitro growth. We tested effects on viral entry, DNA synthesis, and RNA expression by measuring HIV-specific low molecular weight DNA and RNA after infection. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of DNA and RNA synthesis were comparable between the nef+ and nef- strains. The effects on viral growth were also examined by following changes in reverse transcriptase activity during the course of infection. The presence of the nef gene product failed to slow viral growth in several different cell types tested, including the human T-lymphocyte cell lines H9 and CEM-SS, human primary T cells enriched for CD4+ cells, and human monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1. On the contrary, the nef+ strain grew more efficiently in some cell types than the nef- strain. The same results were obtained with nef+ and nef- strains of a different virus, HIV-1-432, whose Nef had been reported to have a negative effect on viral growth. Our data suggest that the Nef protein does not act as a negative factor, at least in the experimental systems employed in our studies.\r"

Nef has been reported to down-regulate viral gene transcription directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. To assess the possible role of Nef in the initiation or maintenance of viral latency, we prepared two different nef expression vectors (pNEF from the HXB-3 proviral clone; pNEF-2/3 from HXB-2 and HXB-3) and a control vector containing a frameshift mutation in the HXB-3 nef coding sequence (pNEF-fs). Consistent with prior studies, the Nef proteins produced by pNEF and pNEF-2/3 were approximately 27 kDa in size, posttranslationally modified by myristoylation, and primarily associated with cytoplasmic membrane structures. However, in contrast to previous reports, these Nef proteins failed to inhibit transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in any of a variety of cell types, including primary human T lymphocytes, Jurkat or YT-1 leukemic T cells, U-937 promonocytic cells, and nonlymphoid COS cells. Furthermore, HXB-3 proviral clones of HIV-1 containing either a wild-type or mutated version of the nef gene replicated in an indistinguishable manner when transfected into COS cells. Our findings suggest that Nef is neither a transcriptional inhibitor nor a negative viral factor under these assay conditions. Rather, we suggest that the primary biological function of this conserved HIV-1 protein has yet to be defined, perhaps reflecting an intrinsic shortcoming in the in vitro experimental systems presently available for the study of HIV-1.\r"

The distribution of mRNA during chicken embryonic development was analyzed in neural and nonneural tissues by using an RNA probe that detects all N-CAM mRNAs and a probe specific for the mRNA of the large cytoplasmic domain (ld) of N-CAM. The results provide a detailed description of the mRNA distribution for N-CAM. The distribution of mRNA for total N-CAM generally corresponded to that of protein but differed at a more detailed level of analysis. For example, the mRNA was localized only within the cell bodies of neurons, whereas the protein was also in neuronal processes; this differential localization was most clearly seen in the alternating layers of cell bodies and fibers in the optic tectum and cerebellum. N-CAM ld mRNA, which arises from alternative RNA splicing, was expressed only in neural tissues, confirming previous biochemical and histological studies. Differential expression of the ld mRNA was detected in specific neural cell types: N-CAM mRNA was present in the ependymal cells of the spinal cord and optic tectum, but mRNA for the ld form was absent. In contrast, the ld mRNA was among the N-CAM mRNAs found in the Purkinje cells and internal granule cells in the cerebellum. The differential expression of mRNAs for the N-CAM forms emphasizes the potential importance of alternative mRNA splicing in modulating adhesive events during embryonic development, particularly in the nervous system.\r"

Moreover, HU-211 induces stereotype and locomotor hyperactivity in mice and tachycardia in rat, effects typically caused by NMDA receptor antagonists. HU-211 is also a potent blocker of NMDA-induced tremor, seizures, and lethality in mice. This compound may therefore prove useful as a nonpsychoactive drug that protects against NMDA-receptor-mediated neurotoxicity.\r"

In abetalipoproteinaemia, a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia and retinopathy occurs secondary to malabsorption of vitamin E. Cases with chorea are often familial, with orofacial dyskinesia and an axonal neuropathy causing areflexia and muscle wasting. Areflexia and a subclinical myopathy also occur in the McLeod syndrome, in which there is abnormal expression of Kell blood group antigens. The exact mechanism of acanthocytosis in each disorder remains uncertain: passive changes in membrane lipids, surface receptor/ligand interactions, and a primary membrane defect are among the possibilities.\r"

  ".W": "The diabetes insipidus which accompanies the DIDMOAD (Wolfram) syndrome is thought to be hypothalamic in origin, though no formal study of vasopressin secretion in the syndrome has been published, and some data in the literature suggest a renal tubular defect. We have studied vasopressin secretion in seven patients with the Wolfram/DIDMOAD syndrome during three dynamic stimuli: an osmotic stimulus (hypertonic saline infusion), hypoglycaemia (insulin tolerance test) and a baroregulatory stimulus (trimetaphan infusion). Hypertonic saline infusion demonstrated three patients to have complete and four to have partial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus; administration of (per nasal) desmopressin excluded nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in all seven patients. Insulin hypoglycaemia failed to stimulate vasopressin release, but trimetaphan-induced hypotension produced significant though subnormal rises in plasma vasopressin in three patients with partial diabetes insipidus, though it produced a negligible rise and no rise in plasma vasopressin in two patients with complete diabetes insipidus. The data suggest a much greater frequency of hypothalamic diabetes insipidus in the Wolfram/DIDMOAD syndrome than is reported, but did not identify nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The absence of vasopressin responses to non-osmotic stimuli in patients with complete diabetes insipidus suggests global lack of vasopressin secreting neurones, rather than an isolated osmoreceptor defect or selective vasopressin secreting neuronal loss, as the lesion producing diabetes insipidus in the DIDMOAD syndrome.\r"

It is their loss or inactivation that is oncogenic. The first evidence of tumor suppressor genes appeared in the early 1970s, but only within the past few years has a wealth of new information illuminated the central importance of these genes. Two or more different suppressor genes may be inactivated in the same tumors, and the same suppressors may be inactive in different tumor types (for example, lung, breast, and colon). The suppressor genes already identified are involved in cell cycle control, signal transduction, angiogenesis, and development, indicating that they contribute to a broad array of normal and tumor-related functions. It is proposed that tumor suppressor genes provide a vast untapped resource for anticancer therapy.\r"

The nucleotide in M1 RNA, residue C92, which participates in a crosslink with the substrate was deleted and the resulting mutant M1 RNA was shown to cleave substrates lacking the 3' terminal CCAUCA sequence at sites several nucleotides away from the normal site of cleavage. The presence or absence of the 3' terminal CCAUCA sequence in transfer RNA precursor substrates markedly affects the way in which these substrates interact with the catalytic RNA in the enzyme-substrate complex. The contacts between wild-type M1 RNA and its substrate are in a region that resembles part of the transfer RNA \"E\" (exit) site in 23S ribosomal RNA. These data demonstrate that in RNA's with very different cellular functions, there are domains with similar structural and functional properties and that there is a nucleotide in M1 RNA that affects the site of cleavage by the enzyme.\r"

A nucleotide (A20) previously identified by others in the dihydrouridine loop of tRNA(Arg)s makes a smaller contribution to the conversion of tRNA(mMet) identity from Met to Arg. The combined anticodon and dihydrouridine loop mutations yield a tRNA(mMet) derivative that is aminoacylated with near-normal kinetics by the Arg-tRNA synthetase.\r"

At nanomolar concentrations, purified endothelial IL-8 and recombinant human IL-8 inhibit neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial monolayers and protect these monolayers from neutrophil-mediated damage. These findings suggest that endothelial-derived IL-8 may function to attenuate inflammatory events at the interface between vessel wall and blood.\r"

Inhibition was blocked by oxidation of the cysteine-rich region of Tat or by incubation with an antibody to Tat before the assay. A synthetic Tat peptide (residues 1 to 58) also inhibited antigen-stimulated proliferation. Experiments with H9 and U937 cell lines showed that Tat can easily enter both lymphocytes and monocytes. The specific inhibition of antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation by Tat mimics the effect seen with lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals and suggests that Tat might directly contribute to the immunosuppression associated with HIV infection.\r"

These stocks were highly pathogenic in absence of detectable replicating murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) other than xenotropic MuLV. They induced expansion of the infected cell population (over 1000-fold), and this cell expansion was oligoclonal in origin and, most likely, arose through cell division. These results suggest that this defective virus is oncogenic, inducing a primary neoplasia associated with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a paraneoplastic syndrome. These data emphasize the need to determine whether virus replication is necessary for the progression of other immunodeficiency diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and whether these diseases also represent paraneoplastic syndromes.\r"

Extensive mutagenesis demonstrated that CAR has a complex secondary structure consisting of a central stem and five stem/loops. Disruption of any of these structures severely impaired the Rev response, but many of the stem/loops contain material that was unnecessary for Rev regulation and must be retained in these structures to avoid disturbing adjacent structures critical for CAR function.

In contrast, fast replicating and highly cytopathic HIV-1 isolates recovered from patients with advanced disease states were not affected by the negative effect of nef present in these lymphoid cell lines. This lack of response to nef appears to constitute another viral feature that correlates with disease progression. Thus, manipulating expression of the nef gene in vivo might influence pathogenesis in the host.\r"

Age, sex, location and size of nodule, duration of symptoms, and family or patient history of thyroid disease did not distinguish between malignant and benign disease preoperatively. Of the seven children with thyroid cancer, six (86%) had unrelated concurrent medical conditions, compared with 9/25 (36%) with benign disease and 2/11 (18%) with adenoma. Fine needle biopsies provided correct preoperative diagnosis in 6/7 cases. As pediatric thyroid malignancy becomes rarer and the high-risk nodule becomes better defined, criteria for surgical versus nonsurgical modes of diagnosis and treatment should become more distinct.\r"

To assess the relationship between hormone receptor content, mammographic tumor morphology, and breast parenchymal patterns, we reviewed charts and mammograms of 210 patients with primary unilateral breast cancer. Mammograms of tumors in 97 patients were divided morphologically into five groups: (1) spiculated mass, (2) architectural distortion, (3) calcifications only, (4) circumscribed mass, and (5) tumor not visible. Estrogen receptor positivity was 81% (39/48) in group 1, 37% (7/19) in group 2, 17% (2/12) in group 3, 31% (4/13) in group 4, and 60% (3/5) in group 5 (P less than .001). Mean estrogen receptor content was also significantly different among groups (P less than .001). There was no statistically significant association between tumor morphology and progesterone receptors, or between calcifications and receptor status. In all 210 patients, hormone-receptor-positive tumors showed no association with mammographic parenchymal pattern. When direct assay of estrogen receptors is unavailable, mammographic appearance of the tumor may suggest the estrogen receptor status.\r"

The discovery of natural killer (NK) cells has added support to this hypothesis. Patients vary widely in their ability to kill metastasizing tumor cells. Patients who survive their initial tumor without subsequent distant disease may have an NK system sufficient to resist recurrence of a similar volume of tumor arising within the field of initial treatment. Both clinical and laboratory investigations suggest that this hypothesis may be applicable to a variety of solid tumors. Surgeons who support this perception of tumor-host balance may prudently limit the extent of their operations for those malignancies so affected.\r"

Over the last 10 years, the impetus for application of these expensive instruments has changed from what the laser can do to what the laser can do better than less expensive technology. Whereas a few controlled randomized studies suggest that the Nd:YAG laser is better than no therapy and equivalent to other heat-producing instruments for control of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such studies do not exist for other laser applications. Despite the lack of such studies, we remain convinced that, where available, lasers are the instrument of choice for palliation of unresectable mucosal-based cancers, coagulation of arteriovenous malformations, and ablation of certain adenomatous polyps in selected patients. New techniques on the horizon include the use of endoscopic photo-dynamic therapy for treatment of gastrointestinal cancers and endoscopic laser fragmentation of large common bile duct stones. The potential role for a nonthermal \"endoscopic scalpel\" is questionable because most gastrointestinal tissues are well vascularized; however, a pulsed laser capable of cutting and coagulation, such as the holmium:YAG laser, may be of some value for incisional endoscopic procedures.\r"

Although the diagnosis of malignant lesions is still commonly delayed because of the absence of early symptoms, surveillance of Barrett's esophagus offers the hope of more definitive management in these patients. Endoscopy has assumed an increasingly important therapeutic role in patients with inoperable cancer because it provides access for new ablative techniques or the placement of palliative prosthetic devices. Continuing advances in the use of endoscopic ultrasound, the delivery of photodynamic therapy, and the adjunctive application of intraluminal irradiation promise to further broaden the scope of fiberoptic intervention.\r"

Endoscopic screening of the upper gastrointestinal tract in asymptomatic persons thus cannot be justified. Surveillance of persons with certain uncommon conditions associated with a higher risk of upper gastrointestinal cancer may be of benefit. These conditions include achalasia, Barrett's esophagus, chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia, familial polyposis coli, gastric polyps, lye stricture, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, and tylosis. In the lower gastrointestinal tract, however, the lifetime risk of developing carcinoma is 5 per cent, premalignant conditions and lesions are common, and carcinoma is curable when detected at an early stage. Sigmoidoscopic screening of asymptomatic adults has been advocated by the American Cancer Society but has not become widely practiced because of its cost, required physician effort, low overall yield, and poor patient compliance. Surveillance by flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended for persons at slightly increased risk of colorectal carcinoma who have prior breast or gynecologic malignancy or a family history of colorectal malignancy. Colonoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients with high risk of colorectal cancer who have had prior colorectal carcinoma or adenoma or who have inflammatory bowel disease or a ureterosigmoidostomy.\r"

  ".W": "For the patient and the clinician, it is well that small-bowel diseases are unusual, as our ability to access this area remains limited. Frequently, all of the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of radiology, endoscopy, and surgery are required for successful resolution of a given problem. Because management of bleeding from a small-bowel source usually will involve the surgeon at some point, it is mandatory that the best \"road map\" be obtained prior to exploration. If a small-bowel source is suspected after a negative endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon, then the clinician must decide which radiographic and endoscopic examination is most appropriate. If bleeding is slow or intermittent, push-type enteroscopy to evaluate the proximal jejunum will have an expected diagnostic discovery rate of about 30 per cent. A stiffening over-tube or internal cable should result in deeper passage of the instrument and a potentially greater yield. Retrograde ileoscopy should be a part of every colonoscopy done for occult bleeding. If endoscopy does not identify a bleeding source, then a detailed barium study of the small bowel using an enteroclysis double-contrast technique will discover more pathology than a standard small-bowel-follow-through. Because sonde-type enteroscopes are not readily available, the clinician must decide at this point whether to refer the patient to an enteroscopist or consider surgery and intraoperative endoscopy. If a bleeding source has been found, then intraoperative endoscopy can localize lesions for specific resection. If the pathology remains obscure, intraoperative endoscopy will have a discovery rate of about 70 per cent. For more active hemorrhage, a bleeding scan with 99mTc-labeled red blood cells can confirm that blood loss is continuing and also will guide the angiographer toward a more directed study, thus decreasing the contrast material load for the patient. If a bleeding source can be identified angiographically, a short course of vasopressin infusion to convert the need for surgical intervention to a more elective situation would be beneficial to the patient. Intraoperative endoscopy under urgent conditions is more difficult, because luminal blood must be lavaged or cleared for a proper examination. Many times, however, intraoperative endoscopy can \"surround\" a segment of intestine by identifying areas that are clearly normal.\r"

Applied experiments have underlined the importance of cleaning equipment thoroughly and have shown the limitations of disinfection. Infection control policies should be revised to meet the following four basic requirements: (1) all precautions should apply to all patients alike--that is, whether infectious or not; (2) equipment should be cleaned thoroughly in detergent immediately after use to remove body secretions and reduce contamination; (3) staff who may be exposed to body secretions should wear simple barrier clothing routinely; and (4) contaminated bronchoscopes should be disinfected for 20 minutes in 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde after cleaning.\r"

Response was assessed as the maximum fall in FEV1 after the patient had run on a treadmill for six to eight minutes. Plasma concentrations of nedocromil sodium were measured at the time of challenge. After exercise challenge the mean (SEM) maximum percentage falls in FEV1 were 30.3 (1.6) for the control run and 28.0 (4.1) after placebo. The percentage fall was attenuated by pretreatment with all concentrations of nedocromil sodium to 12.8 (2.8), 11.2 (2.1), 12.8 (2.1), and 14.1 (3.5) for the 0.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/ml concentrations respectively (p less than 0.001). There were no significant differences between the different nedocromil concentrations. Mean plasma concentrations of nedocromil were proportional to dose. Thus concentrations of nebulised nedocromil sodium that ranged from 0.5 to 20 mg/ml gave a similar degree of protection (50-60%) against exercise induced asthma. This appears to be the maximum protection that can be achieved with nedocromil sodium and is similar to the protection obtained with 4 mg nedocromil administered by metered dose aerosol.\r"

By contrast, moderate drinking increases risk of both intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage in diverse populations. There is insufficient epidemiologic evidence to conclude whether recent alcohol use affects risk of either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. These distinctive associations help explain contradictory reports on the relation between moderate alcohol consumption and risk of \"stroke.\" The high prevalence of alcohol use throughout the world suggests opportunities for primary prevention and the importance of continued research in this area.\r"

We critically examine and summarize several rodent models of transient global ischemia, resulting in selective neuronal injury within vulnerable brain regions, and focal ischemia, typically giving rise to localized brain infarction. We explore the utility of individual models and emphasize the necessity for meticulous experimental control of those variables that modulate the severity of ischemic brain injury.\r"

We analyzed and cross-tabulated 18 clinical characteristics and found four to be significantly associated with a cardioembolic mechanism: stroke with onset during activity and peak deficit at onset (p less than 0.008), previous infarct in a different vascular territory (p less than 0.01), previous transient ischemic attack in a different vascular territory (p less than 0.01), and transient ischemic attack lasting greater than 1 hour (p less than 0.02). Starting with these four characteristics, we used a step-down procedure to select variables for a logistic regression model. Only previous infarct in a different vascular territory (odds ratio = 7.38) and transient ischemic attack lasting greater than 1 hour (odds ratio = 7.89) were selected by the model. Using M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, we compared left atrial size in 46 patients with that in 78 controls who had atrial fibrillation without stroke. Left atrial size in patients and controls with mitral valvulopathy was significantly larger than that in patients and controls without mitral valve disease. There was, however, no difference in left atrial size between patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke and controls or patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and noncardioembolic stroke. We concluded that some clinical characteristics are closely related to cardioembolic stroke and that left atrial enlargement reflects underlying cardiopathy rather than atrial emboli-forming capability.\r"

  ".W": "Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can map the changes in blood velocity that result from stenosis or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. To evaluate patterns of collateral blood flow in disease of the middle cerebral artery stem, we used both cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to study the systolic blood velocities in both anterior cerebral arteries in 10 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion. Five patients had no evidence of hemodynamically significant carotid disease and good-quality measurements of systolic velocity in each anterior cerebral artery. Two of the five patients had middle cerebral artery stem stenosis and the other three had occlusion. The ratios of mean blood velocity in the normal compared with the abnormal side for the five patients (mean 1.34 +/- 0.23, range 1.15-1.74) were significantly higher than ratios for 10 controls (mean 1.04 +/- 0.12, range 0.76 +/- 1.19) using an unpaired t test (t = 3.492, 0.0005 less than p less than 0.005). Our results suggest that transcranial Doppler ultrasound measurements of anterior cerebral artery blood velocity may be a useful index of collateral blood flow from the anterior cerebral artery territory into the middle cerebral artery territory. Changes in mean velocity ratio may document the evolution and adequacy of collateral blood flow over the cerebral convexity in middle cerebral artery stem disease. In addition, the changes in anterior cerebral artery blood velocity appear to be an important corroborative finding for middle cerebral artery stem occlusion.\r"

Our purpose was to determine whether or not patients with a low risk of relapse can be identified at the time of the initial staging evaluation. In 30 of 82 patients (Group 1), embryonal carcinoma constituted less than 80 percent of the tumor, no vessel invasion was present, and the preorchiectomy serum AFP level was less than 80 ng/dL. No relapses occurred in this group. Fifty-two patients (Group 2) had more than 80 percent embryonal carcinoma or vessel invasion or a serum AFP level higher than 80 ng/dL. Relapse occurred in 24 (46%) of these patients. The difference in the rate of relapse between patients in Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant (P less than 0.00001). A separate analysis of teratoma as a predictor of nonrelapse showed that the orchiectomy specimens of 30 of the 82 patients contained more than 50 percent teratoma. Only 1 relapse occurred among 25 patients with more than 50 percent teratoma and no vessel invasion. Our data show that there is a subgroup of patients with clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor who have a very low rate of relapse. We believe these patients can be effectively treated by surveillance and should be spared the morbidity of an unnecessary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.\r"

The risk of nephrectomy in a neonate or infant with this lesion is small and the morbidity is minimal. The alternative to elective nephrectomy is life-long follow-up with blood pressure determinations, beginning in infancy. We report herein two infants with multicystic kidney (MCK) in whom hypertension was cured by its removal. Since accurate blood pressure measurements are relatively difficult to obtain in infants and since periodic long-term follow-up is difficult in the best of circumstances, we are concerned that hypertension caused by a retained MCK goes undiagnosed perhaps more frequently than a review of the current literature suggests. Such hypertension may result in contralateral renal damage and arteriosclerosis, so that later removal of the MCK may not have a beneficial effect on the elevated blood pressure.\r"

Our goal has been to establish a simple screening test to identify neurogenic impotence in patients with normal superficial sensation. High-frequency stimulation at 5.7 c/s and minimal repetitions (300) per trial, allowed thirty to forty minute sessions in alert subjects. With these methods, the amplitudes of cerebral responses at N2 were most informative. All volunteers had measurable amplitude while 11.9 percent of patients did not. An additional 4.5 percent of patients had amplitude suppression of 2 SD compared with the control mean, suggesting that as many as 16.4 percent of such patients may have neural damage. Prolonged latencies alone were rare and not included in this total. Ninety-two of these 128 patients had Doppler flow studies, and only 2 showed both Doppler and electrical abnormalities. This suggests that neurogenic problems may often be independent of vascular disease. This evoked-response screen of the entire genitocerebral neuraxis offers a safe method of identifying a portion of those patients with neurogenic impotence.\r"

Although the appropriate use of medications is often cited as an important part of medical care for the older person, it has not been defined for this group of patients. This article outlines steps pharmacists can take to achieve optimal pharmacotherapy in older patients. Prior to attending a team conference, the pharmacist should interview the patient and review the chart. During the team conference, a comprehensive patient database will be generated that allows medications to be linked to diagnoses. To aid in selecting appropriate medications, the potential for drug-induced functional impairment of mobility, continence, and mental state is reviewed. Recommendations for therapy and establishment of therapeutic endpoints will conclude the patient conference. The pharmacist can contribute much in the process of comprehensive functional assessment and to the goal of achieving optimal pharmacotherapy in older patients.\r"

Hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody, and antinuclear antibody were negative. After discontinuation of disulfiram, the clinical and biochemical manifestations of hepatitis began to resolve and the patient was discharged in a much improved condition. Seventeen previous cases of disulfiram-induced hepatitis are reviewed. It has been suggested that the mechanism of hepatotoxicity is an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The findings in this case are consistent with the earlier descriptions of hypersensitivity hepatitis, and lend further support to the possibility that disulfiram may cause hepatitis.\r"

The success of PCA has resulted in a proliferation of marketed devices to administer small bolus doses of parenteral pain-control drugs at fixed intervals controlled by the patient with the push of a button. Because patients demonstrate marked individual variation in pain medication requirements, PCA devices should be able to accommodate rapidly changing requirements for drugs with a minimum amount of effort on behalf of health care personnel. Crude electronic devices were developed in the late 1960s and the early 1970s and usually consisted of a syringe pump connected to some sort of timing device. Most modern PCA devices marketed in the past five years are much more sophisticated devices that are microprocessor based and some newer devices even generate hard copy for a permanent record of drug administration. Although many such devices are available (including a totally disposable PCA device), few have undergone extensive clinical evaluation. A review of the literature shows many devices are available for use without a single publication to document the safety and utility of the device in the routine patient care situation. Use of the PCA method of pain control will grow, and all hospital-based health care personnel should become familiar with their use and limitations.\r"

These studies have demonstrated that ventricular ectopy is not uncommon in persons with no evidence of heart disease. However, it is rarely of high density or repetitive, and even when frequent or repetitive, or both, carries little, if any, risk of sudden death in patients without syncope. However, in patients with organic heart disease and in certain clinical settings, frequent and repetitive ventricular ectopy identifies a population at high risk for arrhythmia-induced syncope or sudden death. These rhythm disturbances have particular prognostic importance in ischemic heart disease with depressed left ventricular function and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with presyncope or syncope and structural heart disease who demonstrate frequent and repetitive ventricular ectopy are also a high-risk group. Therefore, individual risk stratification is important in deciding whether and how to treat patients with ventricular ectopy.\r"

  ".W": "Heart failure is almost without exception associated with arrhythmias, which may be either supraventricular or ventricular. Supraventricular arrhythmias include frequent supraventricular extrasystoles, and episodic or chronic atrial fibrillation. The absence of atrial contraction may further reduce cardiac output, as may impaired control of QRS frequency. Therefore, supraventricular arrhythmias may be markers of the degree of heart failure and these arrhythmias will respond to heart failure therapy including diuretics, nitrates and, possibly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Ventricular rate will be controlled by cardiac glycosides and further rate reduction obtained by verapamil or diltiazem. The rationale for this therapy is to optimize heart rate without compromising contractility. Severe heart failure is generally accompanied by severe ventricular arrhythmias including repetitive forms. Improving left ventricular function by ACE inhibition is accompanied by a reduction in the number of ventricular premature complexes and also a reduction in the rate of ventricular tachycardia. ACE inhibition reduces mortality but does not seem to influence sudden death rate, and sudden death patients may have different neurohormonal responses compared with patients destined to die of progressive heart failure. Uncontrolled trials with class IA or class III antiarrhythmic drugs have suggested that prognosis may be improved, but other studies have pointed out the increased risk of proarrhythmic responses in patients with low ejection fraction.\r"

Therefore, there is a need for new, effective and long-acting drugs with a wide therapeutic range and a low level of toxicity. Most new class I compounds block the fast sodium ion inward current of myocardial cells. According to their effects on the recovery kinetics of the sodium ion channel, these drugs are classified into 3 groups: IA (intermediate--cibenzoline, pirmenol, hydroxy-3-S-dihydroquinidine, quinacainol); IB (fast--tocainide, moricizine); IC (slow--flecainide, encainide, propafenone, lorcainide, indecainide, recainam and penticainide). Class IC drugs greatly depress intracardiac conduction and are the most potent antiarrhythmic compounds able to suppress ventricular premature beats. However, it is doubtful that long-term suppression of ventricular arrhythmias will improve survival of the patients. Some new drugs have been developed belonging to other classes: class II, esmolol, a new ultrashort-acting beta blocker; class III, N-acetyl-procainamide and sotalol, which prolong duration of the action potential and increase ventricular refractoriness; class IV, the mixed sodium ion-calcium ion-potassium ion antagonist, bepridil. The pharmacologic properties and the clinical effects of these new antiarrhythmic drugs are reviewed. However, future therapeutic trends will depend on the results of large multicenter clinical secondary prevention trials such as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. New antiarrhythmic drugs with original electrophysiologic profiles and minimal adverse effects must prove their ability not only to suppress arrhythmias but also to reduce sudden cardiac death rate.\r"

The test meals provided 50 g egg, 133 g orange juice, 129 g 2% milk, 180 g coffee, 5 g margarine, and 30 g available carbohydrate from either all bran or corn flakes with 19 g or 1 g of dietary fiber, respectively. Plasma glucose and insulin responses were higher for the corn flake breakfast and the incremental area under the glucose curve was 40% greater than that for the all bran breakfast (t test, p less than 0.05). These results are consistent with the reported glycemic indices for these cereals when consumed alone but the glucose responses differ to a lesser degree when the cereals are ingested with other foods. Thus, in this group of well-defined subjects the effect of all bran and corn flakes on plasma glucose responses is attenuated when these cereals are incorporated into mixed meals.\r"

  ".W": "Based on a review of the literature, ethnic and genetic factors are significant determinants of bone mass, along with such environmental factors as diet and exercise. Differences in bone density between blacks and whites remain even after adjustment for body mass. Black-white differences in bone mass appear to be related to ethnicity because blacks have not only greater skeletal calcium content, but also greater total body potassium and muscle mass. Genetic studies of twins and parent-offspring pairs reflect strong constitutional associations of both bone mineral content and bone density at commonly measured skeletal sites. At least for females, bone mass accumulation by age 20 y is highly associated with maternal bone mass; up to menopause it is enhanced by child-bearing and lactation; beyond menopause environmental factors seem to dominate. Dietary calcium and physical activity are significant in the control of bone mass. These findings are important for osteoporosis and fractures, especially in elderly people.\r"

No difference in gastric emptying, recorded by gamma camera after mixing 51Cr with the meals, was found between the meals. The bean-flakes meal gave significantly lower blood glucose (p less than 0.01) and serum insulin (p less than 0.05) concentrations than did the potato-flakes meal. The overall blood glucose response, calculated as incremental area under the curves for 2 h, also differed between the meals (p less than 0.05) whereas the overall insulin response did not differ significantly. The low glycemic response after bean flakes could not be explained by the gastric emptying rate, which provides additional evidence for the slow digestion of bean starch in the small intestine.\r"

It is mainly a disease of older age, predominantly in the 6th and 7th decades, with a male-to-female ratio of 2 to 1. Of all published cases, 60 (43.16%) occurred in the lower third, 40 (28.77%) in the middle third, 25 (17.98%) at the junction of the middle and lower thirds, and 14 (10.07%) in the upper third. Dysphagia was the commonest symptom and was found in 79.5% of cases. The tumors were polypoid, pedunculated, often pigmented, and usually presented as clinically advanced neoplasms. The histological and cytological features were similar to those of lentigo maligna melanoma, but with a more aggressive biological behavior. Hematogenous and lymphatic metastases were common. The overall survival was 9.8 months, and two-thirds of the patients died within a year of diagnosis, irrespective of therapeutic modalities. Deaths were disease-related in 85% of cases. It is concluded that, for operable patients, radical surgical resection is the treatment of choice, either for palliation or for cure, with a 5-yr survival of 4.2%. Irradiation is useful as a palliative or adjuvant measure. The roles of chemotherapy and immunostimulation need further evaluation.\r"

Presentation with rashes and hypertension was most common in patients with drug-associated nephritis. Eosinophils, which were present in the majority of the renal biopsies, did not distinguish between drug-related and non-drug-related disease. The majority of the children had a good outcome irrespective of the insulting agent. Frequent tubular basement membrane breaks were identified in seven of the biopsies but were not associated with a poor outcome. Proximal tubule brush border thinning, demonstrated by periodic acid-Schiff and Tetragonolobus lotus staining, paralleled the severity of acute renal failure. Lectin and immunohistochemical techniques to identify proximal tubules (Tetragonolobus lotus), thick ascending limb of Henle (anti-Tamm-Horsfall protein antibodies), and collecting ducts (Arachis hypogaea) allowed better delineation of sites of inflammation and injury, showed collecting tubules to be involved in all cases, and demonstrated that small atrophic tubules were able to maintain the ability to stain with the appropriate lectin/antibody. It is proposed that studies using these techniques may better identify the nephron sites involved in a variety of renal diseases involving tubular segments.\r"

Anemia was significantly ameliorated in the treated patients. No acceleration in the progression of renal failure (1/serum creatinine v time) or change in serum potassium was noted for either the placebo or treated group over the 12-week period. Six of seven treated patients had a significant decrease in serum ferritin and percent transferrin saturation (plasma iron/total iron-binding capacity). This resulted in functional iron deficiency and the requirement for iron supplementation. The average systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients during the study. Quality of life was improved in all r-HuEPO-treated patients but not in those in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of r-HuEPO in the correction of anemia in predialysis patients without adverse effects on renal function over a 12-week period. Improved patient well-being as a result of the correction of anemia resulted in one patient refusing appropriate initiation of dialysis therapy.\r"

The results show there are major differences in large-molecular-weight substance substance handling by different dialyzers as shown by differences in beta 2-microglobulin clearance, independent of ultrafiltration capacity. Membranes made from similar material, eg, Asahi's PAN and Hospal's AN-69 membrane, both made from polyacrylonitrile, differ significantly in their beta 2-microglobulin clearance. Increased surface area results in much greater increase in large-molecular-weight substance clearance. The present study clearly demonstrates that high water flux is not related to high large-molecular-weight permeability. Decisions with respect to impact on dialysis must be based on a knowledge of both the large- and small-molecular-weight permeabilities of the various membranes.\r"

Laboratory evaluation showed hyperaldosteronism and hyporeninemia despite enalapril administration. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed a left adrenal mass which, on surgical removal, was found to be a cortical adenoma. Subsequently, her antihypertensive therapy has been reduced to a single agent. Previous authors have described only four patients with malignant hypertension who had the rare clinical combination of renal artery stenosis and an aldosteronoma.

The underlying basis for this clinical association remains unknown, and much attention has been focused on a possible role for hyperinsulinemia in these processes. However, evidence also suggests direct hypotensive effects of insulin. It is therefore unclear to what extent hyperinsulinemia contributes to, rather than merely reflects, these multiple metabolic abnormalities. Recent research links both hypertension and diabetes to common defects in calcium and magnesium metabolism, at least in part described by increased cytosolic free calcium, suppressed intracellular free magnesium, and their associated intracellular and hormonal alterations. Thus, hypertension, peripheral insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia may be different clinical manifestations of a common underlying cellular defect in divalent ion metabolism.\r"

In addition, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been demonstrated in rat models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats and Sprague-Dawley rats fed a fructose-enriched diet, and the defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in these experimental models can also be shown at the cellular level. Furthermore, experimental interventions that prevent insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia from developing in fructose-fed rats also greatly attenuate the increase in blood pressure. Finally, endogenous hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been identified as factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease, and may contribute to the increased prevalence of ischemic heart disease in patients with high blood pressure. The fact that past antihypertensive treatment has not focused on these metabolic abnormalities, and, indeed, may have exacerbated them, could help explain why it has been difficult to show that lowering blood pressure decreases risk of coronary artery disease. These observations raise the possibility that abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in both the etiology and the clinical course of hypertension.\r"

The condition is characterized by distinct clinical presentations and physiologic and biochemical abnormalities. Potential mechanisms for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy are complex but are probably associated, in part, with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Primary hypertension is also associated with the development of myocardial abnormalities. Many of these changes are similar to those seen in diabetic cardiomyopathy. It is now clear that the co-existence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus produces a more severe cardiomyopathy than that produced by hypertension or diabetes alone. Potential mechanisms for interaction are numerous. Treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients must be targeted to more specific needs. Antihypertensive drugs should not worsen cardiac risk factors or glucose control and should have favorable effects on left ventricular function. The calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have pharmacologic profiles that make them attractive as monotherapy for diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic nephropathy ultimately develops in approximately, 40 percent of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as well as in a significant fraction of those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Consequently, diabetic nephropathy represents the most common single cause of end-stage renal failure in adults. Recent studies indicate that the subset of insulin-dependent diabetic patients who develop nephropathy may have a genetic susceptibility to renal injury resulting from the abnormal physiologic milieu associated with diabetes. This is perhaps due to abnormal glomerular hemodynamic responses resulting in glomerular capillary hypertension. Diabetic nephropathy progresses through a prolonged subclinical stage characterized by abnormal urinary albumin excretion rates (30 to 250 mg/24 hours, \"microalbuminuria\") and small, but significant, increases in arterial blood pressure. This stage of incipient diabetic nephropathy represents the earliest point at which patients destined to develop overt diabetic nephropathy (albumin excretion rate of more than 250 mg/24 hours, hypertension, and decreased glomerular filtration rate) can be identified, and targets a population that may benefit from therapy aimed at preventing progression of renal failure. Hypertension is intimately related to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Control of hypertension has been clearly shown to slow or arrest the progression of diabetic nephropathy and represents the most important therapeutic option available. Preliminary studies suggest that treatment consisting of strict metabolic control and selective antihypertensive agents during the stage of incipient nephropathy could potentially prevent the development of overt nephropathy. Although control of hypertension with any regimen is most likely beneficial, those agents endowed with selective protective effects on the glomerulus may confer optimal preservation of renal function. Patients with diabetes mellitus, whether insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, are at increased risk for developing systemic arterial hypertension. The treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients takes on importance beyond the usual concerns for reducing blood pressure in other hypertensive patients. In diabetic patients, hypertension is directly linked to the development and progression of nephropathy. If this devastating complication is to be minimized or prevented, then control of arterial hypertension must be a major goal of therapy from the earliest stages of the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of antihypertensive drugs on glucose metabolism are an important consideration in the selection of pharmacologic therapy for diabetic patients. Diuretics can elevate blood glucose levels, aggravate glucose intolerance, and predispose diabetic patients to hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma. Beta-blocking drugs often exacerbate and prolong insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics. Beta-blockers may also cause hyperglycemia. Central agonists, alpha-blockers, and vasodilators apparently have neutral effects on carbohydrate metabolism in normal subjects or in hypertensive diabetics. Calcium channel blockers may disturb carbohydrate metabolism in diabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have little effect on glucose metabolism. Because diabetic patients are prone to fluid, electrolyte, hormone, and lipid disturbances, it is important to consider the effects of antihypertensive drugs on these aspects of metabolism when selecting pharmacologic therapy. The effects of various antihypertensive drugs on sodium, calcium, magnesium, and acid/base balance are reviewed. The effects of these drugs on serum uric acid and potassium, as well as on hormone and lipid levels, are also considered.\r"

  ".W": "The Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes recommends starting pharmacologic treatment of hypertension with a small dose of a thiazide, beta-blocker, prazosin hydrochloride, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker. Thus, these alternatives are regarded as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Both thiazides and beta-blockers can cause deterioration in glycemic control and have an unfavorable influence on the lipoprotein profile. These metabolic side effects may partly counteract beneficial effects. Non-selective beta-blockers should probably be avoided in diabetic patients, since blockade of the beta-2 receptor may be associated with a compromise in peripheral blood flow and with problems associated with hypoglycemia. Cardioselective beta-blockers, which may have primary preventive effects on coronary disease, are beneficial in this patient group. In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without nephropathy or overt fluid retention, diuretic therapy could be replaced by sodium restriction and/or calcium channel blocker therapy, since these agents also have a mild diuretic effect. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and prazosin hydrochloride have minimal metabolic side effects, making them suitable for treatment of hypertension in this patient group.\r"

Insulin resistance may contribute to this increased prevalence. Abnormal cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis may link insulin resistance and high blood pressure in patients with NIDDM. Observations of abnormal cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in animal models of NIDDM and obesity as well as in diabetic patients are consistent with this hypothesis. Abnormalities in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis are also found in hypertensive animals and humans. Alterations in cell membrane phospholipid content and distribution may be the primary cause of abnormal plasma membrane Ca2+ fluxes in patients with NIDDM and hypertension.\r"

To detect changes in these components during a mirthful laughter experience, the authors studied 10 healthy male subjects. Five experimental subjects viewed a 60 minute humor video and five control subjects did not. Serial blood samples were measured for corticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, beta-endorphin, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac)--the major serum neuronal catabolite of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and prolactin. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that cortisol and dopac in the experimental group decreased more rapidly from baseline than the control group (p = 0.011, p = 0.025, respectively). Epinephrine levels in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control at all time points (p = 0.017). Growth hormone levels in the experimental group significantly increased during baseline (p = 0.027) and then decreased with laughter intervention (p less than 0.0005), whereas, the controls did not change over time (p = 0.787). ACTH, beta-endorphin, prolactin, and norepinephrine levels did not significantly increase. The mirthful laughter experience appears to reduce serum levels of cortisol, dopac, epinephrine, and growth hormone. These biochemical changes have implications for the reversal of the neuroendocrine and classical stress hormone response.\r"

The early manifestations of ARDS are caused by increased permeability of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to pulmonary edema, stiff lungs, and a large right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNS) are involved in the pathogenesis of most ARDS, and multiple PMN mechanisms can effect pulmonary injury; interactions between PMN adherence, proteolytic enzyme release, and oxygen radical production are emphasized. ARDS therapy remains largely supportive and has had little impact on mortality. The complications of infection and multiorgan failure play important roles in determining ARDS outcome.\r"

Previously tax protein expression in the muscle and peripheral nerves of three independent mouse lines was reported. Here the localization of this transgenic protein at a cellular and subcellular level is described. Tax protein was expressed in oxidative muscle fibers that developed severe progressive atrophy. It localized to the cytoplasma where it was associated with structures resembling degenerating Z bands. This pattern of muscle fiber involvement is similar to that observed in human retroviral associated myopathy. This transgenic mouse model suggests that preferential expression of the HTLV-1 viral promoter in oxidative muscle fibers may explain the productive infection of these fibers in HTLV-1 myopathy.\r"

There were two types of rectal carcinoids: Type A (n = 5) was diffusely argyrophilic and immunoreactive for serotonin with many hCG alpha-positive cells (16.7%-91.1%). Type B (n = 5) was dispersedly argyrophilic and contained, at most, 5% positive cells for pancreatic polypeptide (PP) with hCG alpha cells in 1.4% to 9.7%. By double immunostaining, 55.0% to 89.7% of hCG alpha cells were synchronously immunoreactive for serotonin in Type A and 3.2% to 11.8% of hCG alpha cells showed PP-positivity in Type B. HCG alpha-positive granules had a constant relationship between perimeter (P) and area (A), log10 A approximately D log10 P, in each case (n = 5). The inverse correlation was found between the value of D and the frequency of hCG alpha in the tumor or in the neoplastic cells (P less than 0.05). HCG alpha may represent the quantitative difference of rectal carcinoids and its expression may have some relation with granule morphology in neoplastic endocrine cells of the rectum.\r"

  ".W": "A new monoclonal antibody, KP1, against the CD68 antigen, which labels macrophages and other members of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage in routinely processed tissue sections, has been used to stain a range of lymphoid, histiocytic, and myelomonocytic proliferations. All 20 neoplasms of myeloid, myelomonocytic, and presumed macrophage derivation reacted with antibody KP1. None of the 22 cases of T cell neoplasia had positive reactions. Although 14 of 41 B lineage lymphomas and leukaemias were stained by antibody KP1, staining was usually confined to small dots of reactivity, in contrast to the strong and extensive cytoplasmic staining seen in the neoplasms of myeloid and macrophage/monocyte origin. Furthermore, positive B cell neoplasms were almost all small cell proliferations, which are unlikely to be confused with myelomonocytic malignancies. It was concluded that antibody KP1 is a valuable addition to a panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotyping lymphomas, particularly in routinely fixed tissues. It should assist the pathologist in the recognition of extramedullary presentation of leukaemia, aid in the diagnosis of suspected cases of true histiocytic neoplasia, and allow for quantitation of macrophages infiltrating lymphomas and other solid tumors.\r"

For this purpose, probes for repetitive DNA targets in the (peri) centromeric region of chromosomes 1 and 18 were used. Hybridization results with both probes of 35 TCCs, which had a DNA index of approximately 1.0 as concluded from FCM, showed evident chromosome 1 aberrations in approximately 25% of the tumors, and in a few cases an aberration for chromosome 18 was detected. Comparison of the ISH spot numbers for both chromosomes showed in most cases a higher number for chromosome 1 than for chromosome 18. ISH on 18 cases of TCCs, which showed a single peak in FCM with a DNA-index of 1.2 to 3.2, exhibited a profound heterogeneity. In these TCCs the ratio between chromosomes 1 and 18 varied over a wide range, resulting in cases showing more hybridization signals for chromosome 1 than for chromosome 18 or the opposite. Furthermore, using ISH minor cell populations showing polyploidization and giant cells containing numerous ISH signals could occasionally be detected. Results showed that interphase cytogenetics by ISH enable a fast screening of numerical chromosome aberrations and detection of different cell populations within one tumor, which was apparently homogeneous according to FCM.\r"

Islet B-cell class II proteins decreased after 20 days of in vitro culture. These results suggest that 1) a variety of pancreas and islet nonendocrine cells can express class I and II proteins, 2) normal pancreatic islet endocrine cells not only express class I proteins but also class II proteins, and 3) in vitro islet culture results in reduced expression of class II proteins by islet B cells.\r"

The B lineage derivation of Ig-negative follicular lymphomas was confirmed by the presence of Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangements in eight of eight lymphomas tested. In a way similar to Ig-expressing follicular lymphomas, the Ig-negative tumors were characterized by bcl-2 gene rearrangements (seven of eight) and overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein (eight out of nine). In two of the three lymphomas with Ig-positive and Ig-negative tumor cell populations, the clonal relationship of the Ig-expressing and nonexpressing cells was established by demonstration of identical t(14; 18) DNA rearrangements. The findings demonstrated that the variability of Ig expression in follicular lymphomas reflects the phenotypic heterogeneity of these tumors and is not a manifestation of separate clonal origins.\r"

Histologic evaluation, using the updated Kiel classification, showed that these large-cell lymphomas represent a morphologic spectrum, often making classification rather arbitrary. It is therefore concluded that the clinical relevance of histologic subtyping is limited for this group of lymphomas. Immunophenotypical studies revealed significant differences between CD30-positive and CD30-negative lymphomas. CD30-positive lymphomas generally presented with localized skin disease, and had a favorable prognosis (9 of 10 patients alive and in complete remission; median survival, 37 months). In contrast, CD30-negative lymphomas often presented with or rapidly developed generalized disease; all patients died of lymphoma (median survival, 17 months). These findings suggest that CD30 expression is an important prognostic parameter for this group of primary cutaneous large-cell lymphomas.\r"

Apathy is defined as diminished motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. In its differential diagnosis, abulia, akinesia and akinetic mutism, depression, dementia, delirium, despair, and demoralization must be ruled out. Classification of apathy is organized in terms of its adaptive and functional consequences, its relationship to personality or to sociocultural or environmental events, and its association with psychiatric, neurological, and medical disorders. An approach to assessment and treatment is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Factors influencing ethanol elimination rate and blood acetaldehyde concentration with regard to age, blood ethanol concentration, and degrees of alcoholic liver disorder were studied in alcoholic patients vis-a-vis healthy subjects. Ninety-four male alcoholic patients were divided into five groups according to age and into three groups according to blood ethanol concentration which ranged between 4.21 and 0.29 mg/ml. It was noted that as age increased, blood ethanol concentration decreased. Groups A, B, and C consisted of subjects whose ethanol levels were more than 2.5, between 1.0 and 2.5, and less than 1.0 mg/ml, respectively. Average values of ethanol elimination rate in Groups A, B, and C were 0.26, 0.23, and 0.18 mg/ml/hr, respectively. The rate increased as blood ethanol concentration elevated. The rate in Group B was significantly higher than that in the healthy control subjects who had blood ethanol levels between 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml. The rate of ethanol elimination was independent of liver disorder judged by liver function test values. Blood acetaldehyde concentrations in the patients were less than 1.48 micrograms/ml, with an average value of 0.58 microgram/ml, and were significantly correlated with blood ethanol levels in both alcoholics and healthy subjects.\r"

  ".W": "It has been known for some years that a partial deglycosylation of transferrin occurs in the sera of alcohol abusers. Different methods have been proposed in order to evaluate this carbohydrate-deficient fraction of serum transferrin. Chromatofocusing or isoelectric focusing followed by direct immunofixation have been used until now. Recently, a new method called the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) test based on ion-exchange chromatography has been developed by Stibler et al. (Alcohol Clin Exp Res 10:535-544, 1986). Here we compare this new method with results obtained using our Tf index determination method. The upper limit of normal values was set to the 90th percentile of the values observed in a reference population. The population under investigation consisted of 50 healthy volunteers and 160 alcohol abusers whose ethanol consumption was evaluated through a questionnaire. Sensitivity and specificity of the CDT test have been found higher than 0.76 and 0.90, respectively. The correlation between both methods was 0.794, a satisfactory result considering that the CDT test and the Tf index do not exactly measure the same part of the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin. In a population of 23 patients with liver diseases not related to alcohol abuse, no abnormal CDT value was observed. We can conclude from these results that the CDT test now seems to be the best test to detect alcohol abusers.\r"

The present report tested the theory using three tasks that tap functions, other than visuospatial abilities, which have been failed by patients with right hemisphere damage. The first task assesses the ability to draw a correct inference by integrating information from two unrelated sentences. The second taps the patient's capacity to appreciate humor. The third requires the patient to interpret the emotion displayed in a face. On all three tasks, the pattern of responses of chronic alcoholics differed from that of patients with right hemisphere damage. Thus, the right hemisphere deficit theory fails to gain support from this investigation. On the other hand, the chronic alcoholics' performance was impaired relative to contemporary controls on the first two tasks, although not on the last. On the first two tasks, alcoholics' impairment approximated, and in one instance exceeded, that seen in normal elderly controls. Thus, a premature aging hypothesis received modest support from this study.\r"

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid ethanol diet (35% ethanol-derived calories), a pair-fed isocaloric liquid diet, or a standard laboratory rat chow and water diet beginning on Day 12 of gestation and continuing through parturition. Although there were no significant differences in the enzymatic activity of 5-ene-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase or C17,20-lyase, the enzymatic activity of 17 alpha-hydroxylase was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced (i.e., approximately 36%) in the ethanol-exposed pups compared to those from the pair-fed and chow treatment groups. This lesion in testicular steroidogenic enzyme activity in newborn male pups exposed to alcohol in utero was transient as 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity from the ethanol-exposed animals returned to control levels by postnatal Day 20 and remained at control levels through adulthood (postnatal Day 60). These data suggest that the suppression of the perinatal testosterone surge in male rats exposed to alcohol in utero and the associated long term demasculinizing effects of prenatal ethanol exposure might be the result of reduced testicular steroidogenic enzyme activity in the perinatal animal.\r"

The time a pair of mice spent in active social interaction, aggressive behavior, and avoidance-irritability showed an isolation-related increase, while locomotor activity was not affected by 0-10 days of isolation. Ethanol (0.8 g/kg) reduced the social interaction time in mice isolated for 10 days and 2.0 g/kg ethanol reduced it in all groups. Ethanol induced a locomotor stimulatory effect both in group-housed and isolated animals. An aggression-inducing effect of 0.8 g/kg ethanol was observed only in mice isolated for 5 days, while mice isolated for 10 days reduced their aggressive behavior after this dose of ethanol. The loss of righting reflex after 3.5 g/kg ethanol did not appear to vary with isolation. The results suggest that isolation alters some effects of ethanol qualitatively (e.g., its effects on aggressive behavior) but leaves other effects (e.g., its locomotor stimulant and hypnotic effects) unchanged.\r"

Eighty-five percent of eligible men on electoral rolls in Caerphilly, Wales (derivation set, N = 2512) and 90% of eligible men on the practice lists of 16 Speedwell, England, general practitioners participated (validation set, N = 2348). Alcohol consumption was assessed by questionnaire with heavy alcohol consumption defined as the top 10% of the Caerphilly population's alcohol usage (greater than 525 cc ethanol per week). The prediction rule, Score = (mean corpuscular volume x 1.00) + (body mass index x 0.31) + (systolic blood pressure x 0.08) + HDL-cholesterol x 9.24) + (fasting triglyceride x 2.20) was derived by multiple linear regression in the Caerphilly cohort and validated in the Speedwell cohort. Comparing the lower 20% of the Score distribution with the upper 5%, likelihood ratios increased from 0.15 to 5.29 and 0.06 to 7.42 in the Caerphilly and Speedwell cohorts, respectively. Having a score of 136.30 or greater yielded a relative risk of being a heavy drinker of 23.1 (95% Cl = 10.1-53.0) in Caerphilly and 99.3 (95% Cl = 12.8-769.5) in Speedwell. The derived prediction rule is a valid diagnostic aid to help clinicians identify heavy alcohol consumers.\r"

We pursued here the hypothesis that subjects receiving placebo in an environment previously associated with alcohol ingestion would exhibit conditioned responses as compared with subjects who had only received placebo in the environment. Further, we predicted that these conditioned responses would be opposite in direction to responses obtained during active drink sessions. Twelve subjects received active alcohol during session Days 1 through 4 and a placebo challenge on Day 5; the second group received placebo throughout sessions 1 through 5. On Day 1, heart rate and skin conductance were elevated following active alcohol ingestion as compared with placebo. On Day 5 following the placebo challenge, these physiological responses were significantly lower in the alcohol group as compared with the placebo group; the reversal of effects on Day 5 is suggestive of conditioned compensatory responses. Also, following the placebo on Day 5, desire to drink scores of the alcohol group were greater than those of the placebo group. The present data suggest that subjects exhibit conditioned compensatory responses when the environment signals alcohol availability. Results are consistent with Siegel's model of conditioned compensatory responses to repeated drug administration, and may help to account for some aspects of tolerance development and conditioned withdrawal.\r"

In pilot experiments peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were studied before and after a single ingestion of 0.7 to 3.1 liters of beer or an equivalent dose of ethanol in other beverages. After moderate alcohol consumption there was increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during 28 days of culture without mitogen stimulation as indicated by overnight syncytium formation with SUP-T1 indicator cells and by increased levels of HIV p24 antigen in the culture supernates. There was also decreased ability of lymphocytes to produce interleukin 2 and soluble immune response suppressor activity after stimulation with concanavalin A, the former, possibly both, for over 4 days after alcohol ingestion. These preliminary data extend well-known immunosuppressive effects of chronic alcohol ingestion to acute ingestion and raise the question: Could even casual alcohol consumption enhance HIV infectivity and/or enhance the progression of latent HIV infection?\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a single administration and a 6-week treatment with ethanol on rat liver sialyltransferase activity towards asialoglycoproteins and N-acetyllactosamine (Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc) was studied. Since only the alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase is involved in the in vivo sialylation of transferrin, Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc was chosen as an acceptor and alpha 2,6-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine was separated from the corresponding alpha 2,3-sialyl isomer present in the sialyltransferase reaction mixture by high-performance liquid chromatography. After a single ethanol administration there was a low (about 20%) but significant (p less than 0.005) reduction of sialyltransferase activity towards asialotransferrin as well as a reduced alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase activity towards N-acetyllactosamine. An opposite result was found in the chronically ethanol-treated rats: in these animals either the total or alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase activity was slightly higher than in control animals. Blood ethanol concentration was significantly high (3.3 +/- 1.2 mg/ml) only in the acute-treated animals, suggesting that the accumulation in the body of ethanol and/or its metabolites induces a reduction of liver alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase activity responsible for the transferrin sialylation. Current results are consistent with the finding (Stibler H, Hultcrantz R: Alcohol Clin Exp Res 11:468-473, 1987) that an enhanced level of hyposialylated transferrin isoforms is a marker of present but not previous alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Using equilibrium dialysis, we found that acetaldehyde, at the levels commonly occurring after ethanol ingestion, did not bind detectably to plasma proteins, but there was significant binding to red blood cells, more in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics. The binding to red blood cells was inhibited by pyridoxal phosphate and N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting adduction to amino and thiol groups. Binding kinetics were consistent with at least two sites. The one with the highest affinity for acetaldehyde corresponded to hemoglobin. Its affinity and Bmax were not changed in alcoholics, but these binding sites accounted for only 44% of the sites available in the red blood cells of alcoholics and 80% of those in controls. Moreover, this binding was not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. There was no detectable binding to red cell ghosts. Nonprotein binding was then assessed by changes in NADH produced by the addition of protein-free fractions of the cells to an alcohol dehydrogenase system in equilibrium; this revealed a second binder of lower affinity, larger capacity and with sensitivity to both inhibitors. This binding (possibly due to thiazolidine formation with cysteine) was enhanced in alcoholics, whose red blood cell cysteine content was doubled. Levels of red blood cell cysteine and acetaldehyde remained high for 2 weeks after withdrawal. Because of the prolonged persistence after withdrawal, these changes may provide new markers of alcoholism.\r"

Inbred C57BL/6J (B6) mice were included to confirm previously reported teratogenic effects using our own treatment regimen and standard assessment technique. Intragastric administration of ethanol (5.8 g/kg) on Days 9 and 10 of pregnancy resulted in growth retardation and an increase in prenatal mortality in LS litters but not in SS litters. Therefore, alcohol sensitivity plays a role in the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. B6 mice showed more ethanol teratogenicity than either LS or SS mice, even though maternal blood ethanol levels were similar across genotypes. This result suggests genetic variations other than alcohol sensitivity also influence ethanol teratogenesis.\r"

Eight of 14 (57%) brain samples from alcoholic individuals and four of eight (50%) brain samples from suspected alcoholic individuals had variant forms, while none of 10 samples from nonalcoholic individuals had variant forms.

  ".W": "A conflict task that does not require food or water deprivation is described. Drugs with known anticonflict action including chlordiazepoxide, methysergide, ethanol, and TRH were active in this test while amphetamine, buspirone, and morphine were not. Because this procedure did not require food or water deprivation, the effect of chronic ethanol administered in a liquid diet on the anticonflict actions of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide could be examined. Seven or 12 days of chronic ethanol treatment resulted in tolerance to the acute anticonflict action of ethanol whereas 3 days of treatment did not. Tolerance was not observed to a dose of ethanol administered 3 hr after a previous ethanol treatment. Following a chronic ethanol liquid diet, cross-tolerance to the anticonflict action of chloridazepoxide was observed. This latter observation is consistent with the view that ethanol influences a neural mechanism associated with benzodiazepine function. The importance of tolerance to the anticonflict action of ethanol is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Brief neonatal ethanol exposure (3.0 g/kg/dose, twice daily; postnatal day (PN) 4 to PN8) resulted in cholinergic neurochemical alterations in the cerebellum, but not the hippocampus of rats assayed on PN20. Analysis revealed that the binding affinity of cerebellar muscarinic receptors for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was decreased by ethanol, but only in female pups. Other gender-specific but treatment-independent cerebellar differences were identified as well, including lower levels of choline acetyltransferase activity and S1-level (1,000 x g) crude protein in males and females, respectively. No evidence of ethanol-induced cholinergic change was noted in the hippocampus of the same pups on PN20. However, collapsed across treatment, male hippocampi were found to contain less S1-level protein than their female counterparts. Neither muscarinic receptor density nor acetyl cholinesterase activity were found to differ between treatments or genders, in either brain region. Consistent with the developmental timetables for regional cholinergic synaptogenesis in the rat, observations on PN20 confirm a hypothesis of cerebellar cholinergic vulnerability and hippocampal cholinergic resilience to neonatal ethanol insult.\r"

  ".W": "A cross-sectional study of alcoholics who varied widely in duration of abstinence was combined with a four-year follow-up study of the same subjects. Together, the data demonstrated a course of recovery in abstinent alcoholics measured in three ways: severity of symptoms, probability of relapse, and work history. Additionally, the subjects showed high rates of smoking cessation. By every measure, the course of recovery seemed essentially the same in men and women. The recovery process was most rapid in the early years of abstinence but continued for 10 or more years. It was suggested that keys to full recovery in alcoholics are abstinence and time, which are necessary for recovery from a protracted withdrawal syndrome and brain dysfunction, for the repair of social relationships, for vocational rehabilitation, and for abstinence itself to become stable.\r"

  ".U": "90087247\r", 
  ".W": "The partitioning of ethanol into mouse brain synaptosomes at 37 degrees C was characterized as a function of ethanol concentration. In addition, the partitioning of ethanol into multilamellar dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles was characterized as a function of ethanol concentration and temperature. DPPC liposomes provided a model for ethanol partitioning into a phospholipid bilayer of defined composition allowing comparison to the more complex synaptosomal membrane. The values of the partition coefficients for ethanol depend on the convention used to express concentration in the partition coefficient ratio. We express these concentrations as mole fractions as ethanol in the membrane and aqueous phases. Ethanol partitioning is nonideal (ethanol membrane: buffer partition coefficients vary with total ethanol concentration). In synaptosomes, the partition coefficients vary markedly with concentration and asymptotically approach zero at higher concentrations. In the DPPC system, the variation of the partition coefficient is less pronounced, but significant. The ethanol: DPPC partition coefficients decrease by a factor of 2 at ethanol concentrations above 3.2 x 10(-3) M. This suggests a model involving at least two distinguishable types of interactions of ethanol with the membrane. Ethanol appears to undergo both bulk phase partitioning into the membrane bilayer core and nonspecific binding to the membrane surface. In pure DPPC, bulk phase hydrophobic partitioning predominates. In synaptosomes, nonspecific surface binding appears to be a major interaction. Temperature studies indicate ethanol partitioning into DPPC increases above the phospholipid gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature. This suggests a preferred partitioning of ethanol into fluid state lipid. However, significant membrane concentrations of ethanol are found in gel state DPPC.\r"

The long-term ingestion of large quantities of ethanol has been shown to alter a substantial number of physiologic and biochemical variables. Abnormalities involving leukocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes may occur singly or in various combinations. Due to the frequent concomitant presence of alcohol-related hepatic disease, nutritional deficiencies, infection, and other chronic diseases, it is often difficult to distinguish the specific hematologic toxicities of alcohol ingestion from the hematologic toxicities of associated morbid conditions. Depressed hematopoietic cell formation (Table 2), increased destruction, and alterations in morphology and function of hematopoietic cells have been described.\r"

The two groups were well matched with respect to age, parity, mode of onset of labour and indication for epidural. Maintenance of epidural analgesia by continuous infusion resulted in a significantly decreased need for top-up doses. A reduction in the incidence of hypotension, cardiotocographic evidence of intrapartum fetal hypoxia and Caesarean section was associated with this. It is concluded that the maintenance of epidural analgesia by continuous infusion is a safe and reliable method and may be more advantageous and less labour intensive than the traditional intermittent regimen.\r"

There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in ratings of pain intensity, pain relief or side effects, or in any of the measured pharmacokinetic parameters. No patients in the placebo group experienced any breakthrough pain, and nursing staff were unable to identify which patients had received the active dose of morphine elixir. We conclude that there is no need for a loading dose when aqueous morphine is changed to MST tablets.\r"
