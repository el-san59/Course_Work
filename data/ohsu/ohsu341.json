Neuronal migration has been described during the ontogeny of the avian and mammalian brain. Whereas in mammals most neurogenesis occurs during early development, in the adult avian forebrain wide-spread neurogenesis continues to occur. How do neurons born in adulthood reach their final destination? We report here that small elongated cells, born in the ventricular zone adjacent to the lateral ventricle, differentiate into mature neurons 20-40 days later, after migrating over distances of up to 5 mm. Migration rates are highest (28 micron h-1) when young neurons migrate through regions which are rich in radial glia. The adult vertebrate brain offers unique opportunities for studying factors that regulate neuronal migration, pathfinding and differentiation.\r"

These results, together with the differential tissue location of the two mAChR mRNAs, have indicated that pharmacologically distinguishable subtypes of the mAChR represent distinct gene products. The primary structures of two additional mammalian mAChR species, designated as mAChR III and mAChR IV, have subsequently been deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the cloned cDNAs or genomic DNAs. We report here that mAChR I and mAChR III expressed in NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cells, but not mAChR II and mAChR IV, efficiently mediate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activation of a Ca2+-dependent K+ current and inhibition of the M-current, a voltage-dependent K+ current sensitive to muscarinic agonists.\r"

  ".W": "Neurons communicate by secreting a transmitter that excites or inhibits other neurons at synapses. The role of presynaptic membrane potential in triggering transmitter release is still controversial. In one view, presynaptic action potentials trigger the release by the entry of calcium ions into presynaptic terminals through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Calcium acts at high local concentrations at release sites near channel mouths to cause neurosecretion. An opposing view is that, in addition to elevating presynaptic calcium, presynaptic potential stimulates transmitter release by a distinct direct action. The relative importance of depolarization and calcium entry in neurosecretion cannot be determined because the two events are tightly linked. To delineate the roles of presynaptic potential and calcium entry in transmitter release, we have used nitr-5, a photolabile calcium chelator, and a voltage-clamp technique to control intracellular calcium and membrane potential independently at a synapse formed between cell bodies of cultured neurons of the fresh water snail Helisoma trivolvis. We found transmitter release occurred when presynaptic calcium levels were elevated to concentrations of a few micromolar, and that presynaptic voltage had no direct effect on neurosecretion.\r"

However, the scarcity of this animal and its designation as an endangered species place severe restrictions on its use as an animal model. Attempts to infect mice, rats, hamsters, guinea-pigs, musk shrews, and rabbits with HIV-1 or infected cells have all been unsuccessful. We now report that the intraperitoneal inoculation of rabbits with HIV-1 or chronically infected H9 cells consistently induces a persistent infection.\r"

  ".W": "The human heat-shock factor (HSF) regulates heat-shock genes in response to elevated temperature. When human cells are heated to 43 degrees C, HSF is modified post-translationally from a form that does not bind DNA to a form that binds to a specific sequence (the heat-shock element, HSE) found upstream of heat-shock genes. To investigate the transduction of the heat signal to HSF, and more generally, how mammalian cells respond at the molecular level to environmental stimuli, we have developed a cell-free system that exhibits heat-induced activation of human HSF in vitro. Comparison of HSF activation in vitro and in intact cells suggests that the response of human cells to heat shock involves at least two steps. First, an ATP-independent, heat-induced alteration of HSF allows it to bind the HSE; the temperature at which activation occurs in vitro implies that a human factor directly senses temperature. Second, HSF is phosphorylated. It is possible that similar multi-step activation mechanisms play a role in the response of eukaryotic cells to a variety of environmental stimuli, and that these mechanisms evolved to increase the range and flexibility of the response.\r"

  ".W": "RNA is involved in many biological functions, ranging from information storage and transfer to the catalysis of reactions involving both nucleic acids and proteins. Previous crystallographic studies on RNA oligomeric chains provide only averaged structures or information limited in resolution. The oligomer [U(U-A)6A]2 was chosen for the study of protein-RNA interactions in viruses. Its size and base composition mimic portions of the genomic RNA in alfalfa mosaic virus that bind to the amino terminus of the viral subunit. The actual sequence was designed to guarantee the formation of a single species of duplex and to facilitate the production of the pure oligomer in large quantities. The molecular structure, derived from the 2.25 A resolution X-ray diffraction data, allows the most detailed analysis of an A-RNA helix reported to date. Two kinks are observed that divide the duplex into three blocks, each close to a canonical A-helical conformation. A few intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving 2'-hydroxyl groups stabilize this peculiar conformation of the RNA, which may be related to the temperature used for the crystallization (35 degrees C). The structure demonstrates both the plasticity of the RNA molecule and the role of the 2'-hydroxyl groups in intermolecular interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Uptake of glutamate into glial cells in the CNS maintains the extracellular glutamate concentration below neurotoxic levels and helps terminate its action as a neurotransmitter. The co-transport of two sodium ions on the glutamate carrier is thought to provide the energy needed to transport glutamate into cells. We have shown recently that glutamate uptake can be detected electrically because the excess of Na+ ions transported with each glutamate anion results in a net current flow into the cell. We took advantage of the control of the environment, both inside and outside the cell, provided by whole-cell patch-clamping and now report that glutamate uptake is activated by intracellular potassium and inhibited by extracellular potassium. Our results indicate that one K+ ion is transported out of the cell each time a glutamate anion and three Na+ ions are transported in. A carrier with this stoichiometry can accumulate glutamate against a much greater concentration gradient than a carrier co-transporting one glutamate anion and two Na+ ions. Pathological rises in extracellular potassium concentration will inhibit glutamate uptake by depolarizing glial cells and by preventing the loss of K+ from the glutamate carrier. This will facilitate a rise in the extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels and contribute to the neuronal death occurring in brain anoxia and ischaemia.\r"

In addition, two mammalian genes have been identified that code for predicted gene products with sequence similarity to these receptors, but whose ligand specificity is unknown namely, G21 and the mas oncogene. The mas oncogene shows the greatest sequence similarity to the substance-K receptor, and on this basis it was predicted that it would encode a peptide receptor with mitogenic activity which would act through the inositol lipid signalling pathways. The mas oncogene product was transiently expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and stably expressed in a transfected mammalian cell line. The results demonstrate that the mas gene product is a functional angiotensin receptor.\r"

Also, men and women who spontaneously produce antisperm antibodies are infertile but otherwise healthy. Although the critical sperm antigens are unknown, these observations have led to the proposal that sperm proteins might be useful in the development of a contraceptive vaccine. The guinea pig sperm surface protein PH-20 is essential in sperm adhesion to the extracellular coat (zona pellucida) of the egg, a necessary initial step in fertilization. Here, we report that 100% effective contraception was obtained in male and female guinea pigs immunized with PH-20. Antisera from immunized females had high titres, specifically recognized PH-20 in sperm extracts, and blocked sperm adhesion to the egg zona pellucida in vitro. The contraceptive effect was long-lasting and reversible: immunized females, mated at intervals of six to fifteen months after immunization, progressively regained fertility.\r"

We report here the complete DNA sequence of lin-12: 13.5 kilobases (kb) derived from genomic clones and 4.5 kb from complementary DNA clones. It is of interest that the predicted product is a putative transmembrane protein, given that many of the decisions controlled by lin-12 activity require cell-cell interactions for the correct choice of cell fate. In addition, the predicted lin-12 product may be classified into several regions, based on amino acid sequence similarities to other proteins. These include extensive overall sequence similarity to the Drosophila Notch protein, which also is involved in cell-cell interactions that specify cell fate; a repeated motif found in proteins encoded by the yeast cell-cycle control genes cdc10 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and SW16 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and a repeated motif exemplified by epidermal growth factor, found in many mammalian proteins.\r"

  ".W": "During Caenorhabditis elegans vulval induction the anchor cell of the gonad specifies a spatial pattern of three cell types among a set of six multipotent epidermal cells, the vulval precursor cells (VPCs). Previous studies suggested that the anchor cell produces a graded inductive signal which can directly stimulate VPCs away from a ground state (type 3) to become type 1 or type 2 depending on their distance from the anchor cell. Here, we investigate the interactions among VPCs in a mutant, lin-15, in which VPC fates are rendered partially independent of the inductive signal, and show that type 1 cells actively inhibit adjacent cells from also becoming type 1 cells. The fate of each VPC therefore depends on the combined action of two intercellular signals: a graded inductive signal from the anchor cell, and a lateral inhibitory signal from at least some of its neighbours. Pattern formation among the VPCs lin-15 mutant is analogous to the establishment of the pattern of neuroblasts and dermatoblasts during early insect neurogenesis, suggesting that the similarities in inferred molecular structure of the lin-12 and Notch gene products, which are involved in these two instances of pattern formation, might extend to similarities in function.\r"

  ".W": "Maturation of some messenger RNAs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans involves the acquisition of a 22-base leader at their 5' ends. This 22-base leader, called the spliced leader (SL), is derived from the 5' end of a precursor RNA of 90-100 bases, called spliced leader RNA (SL RNA). SL RNA is transcribed from a 1-kilobase DNA repeat which also encodes the 5S ribosomal RNA. A subset of mRNAs in C. elegans acquire SL from SL RNA by a trans-splicing mechanism. SL behaves as a 5' exon in the trans-splicing reaction. Using antisera against the Sm antigen that is associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), we precipitated SL RNA from extracts of C. elegans, indicating that it is bound by the Sm antigen in vivo. SL RNA also possesses the unique trimethylguanosine (m32,2,7G) cap characteristic of most small nuclear RNAs. Therefore, SL RNA is a chimaeric molecule, made up of an snRNA attached to a 5' exon and is a constituent of a snRNP.\r"

  ".W": "The trans-splicing reaction occurring in trypanosomes and related species as well as in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans involves the transfer of a 5' exon from a spliced leader transcript (SL RNA) to a precursor messenger RNA transcript with a 3' splice acceptor site. This seems to take place in the same nuclear compartment as normal cis splicing and proceeds through Y-branched intermediates analogous to the lariats formed in cis splicing. The cellular machinery catalysing cis and trans splicing might therefore be expected to share some components, particularly in the nematode where some mRNAs are produced by both cis and trans splicing. We generated possible secondary structures for the SL RNAs of several species and found they were remarkably similar although neither nucleotide sequence nor length is conserved. Each contained three stem-loops; strikingly the 5' splice site is adjacent to the turn of the most 5' loop and an Sm-binding consensus sequence is found between the second and third stem-loops. Sm is an antigen associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). When incubated in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, SL RNAs become immunoprecipitable by anti-Sm, but not by other autoantibodies directed against proteins of mammalian snRNPs. We propose that SL RNAs have a dual function in the trans splicing process: they consist of a 5' exon covalently linked to an snRNA-like sequence and seem likely to exist as Sm snRNP particles (SL snRNPs) within the cell. Just as the RNA in the U1 snRNP base-pairs with the 5' splice site, rendering it susceptible to attack in the cis-splicing reaction, so might the SL snRNP autonomously activate its own 5' splice site and thereby eliminate the need for a U1-like snRNP in the trans-splicing machinery.\r"

Irregular loops are the most difficult parts of protein structure to understand and to model correctly. Here, we describe two computer experiments where all the hypervariable loops were deleted from X-ray structures of mouse immunoglobulins and reconstructed using the conformational search program CONGEN. A protocol was developed for reconstruction of the hypervariable loops in McPC 603 antibody. Calculated loop conformations were generated and a model of the combining site was built from selected low-energy conformations. We then modelled hypervariable loops in another antibody molecule, HyHEL-5. Both models agreed well with the known crystal structures. Our results hold out promise for the success of future modelling studies of complete antigen-combining sites from amino acid sequences.\r"

After operation, the center of the disc appears hypodense. The anterior and lateral borders remain sharply delimited, but in 44% of the cases the posterior border shows an image suggesting the persistence of disc herniation. In 84% of the cases, there are major changes in the spinal canal with complete occlusion of the extradural space on the operated side by a heterogeneous material the attenuation value of which ranged between those of cerebrospinal fluid and disc. The outline of the dural sac and of the nerve root is lost. This aspect did not significantly change between the 1st and the 6th postoperative week, except for the disappearance of any air within the canal and a slight movement on the dural sac toward the operated side. From these major radiological modifications found in asymptomatic postoperative patients, it is concluded that positive CT in patients with the failed back surgery syndrome has limited value. Myelography is preferred as the primary neuroradiological investigation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the intracellular physiology of cerebral arterial vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), we measured the activity of three protein kinases related to vascular smooth muscle function. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase activity was determined in canine basilar arteries using the SAH model created by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood. Moderate chronic cerebral vasospasm was confirmed angiographically 7 days after the first injection of blood, with a mean decrease in the diameter of the basilar artery to 61.2 +/- 2.3% (SE) of preinjection controls. Enzymatic analysis of basilar arteries excised from control dogs and from SAH model dogs 2 to 10 days after an intracisternal injection of blood demonstrated detectable MLCK and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase activity. The MLCK activity was approximately 3 times higher than the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase activity. There was no significant difference in basilar artery protein kinase activity between control animals and SAH model animals at any time for up to 10 days after the intracisternal injection of blood. As MLCK is involved with smooth muscle contraction and cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in smooth muscle relaxation, our results suggest that the metabolic machinery of vascular smooth muscle in the cerebral arterial wall is intact after SAH and that prolonged vasospasm represents an appropriate physiological response by the vascular smooth muscle to external stimuli. If this is correct, the successful pharmacological manipulation of vasospasm after SAH is more likely than if profound disruption had occurred, and further investigative efforts in this area should be encouraged.\r"

Malignant hyperthermia is usually triggered by potent inhaled anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants. Because of the extraordinary risk of death in patients who are susceptible, neurosurgeons may be reluctant to operate on these patients. Three such patients were referred to the Neurosurgery Service and the UCLA Malignant Hyperthermia Center after neurosurgical procedures aborted for first episodes of malignant hyperthermia. They were anesthetized with nitrous oxide, barbiturates, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The patients were not treated prophylactically with dantrolene. Cardiac monitoring, end-tidal pCO2, and rectal temperatures were followed. After completion of the neurosurgical procedures, all three patients had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy and subsequent caffeine/halothane contracture studies. The contracture study was positive in all patients. No anesthetic or surgical complication was encountered. This study demonstrates that neurosurgical procedures can be performed safely in patients at risk of developing malignant hyperthermia while they undergo appropriately selected general anesthesia.\r"

Within each age range, recovery of memory was compared in patients with mild to moderate CHI and survivors of severe injury. Consistent with previous findings obtained in head-injured children sampled from a wide age range, the present study confirms that memory deficit persists at least 1 year after severe CHI. Impairment of visual recognition memory was directly related to severity of CHI in all three age ranges. The severity of CHI was directly related to initial and residual verbal memory deficit in adolescents, but this effect was inconsistent in children. We suggest that the cerebral substrate for visual recognition memory was well established in all three age ranges and thus was vulnerable to the effects of injury. In contrast, verbal memory skills were undergoing rapid development in the adolescents, but were still immature in children. Extended follow-up could conceivably demonstrate the late appearance of verbal memory deficit in the children who had apparent sparing of function.\r"

The profile of the orbit was estimated from five dry human skulls, and the measurements were approximated to frame models. The deformation of these models by raised intraorbital pressure was calculated by computer simulation using the finite element method. In all of the orbital models, the deformation of the orbital floor was significantly greater than that of the roof. These findings verified that the orbital roof has a higher resistance than the floor against raised intraorbital pressure. We suspect that this resistance is due to the arched shape of the orbital roof, whereas the floor is rather flat.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred twenty-three of 255 consecutive patients underwent cerebral angiography 16.9 +/- 11.6 days (SD) after high velocity missile injury to the head over a 29-month study period. Shell fragments were the most frequent projectiles (73.7%), and penetrating wounds were the most frequent injuries (61%). During the study, 2 patients (1 with an ophthalmic and the other with an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm) presented with delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma; the first patient had had negative angiography 90 days earlier, and the second patient was admitted from a rehabilitation center after operation in another center 25 days earlier for a penetrating left frontal shell fragment injury. Six of 223 patients (2.7%) had dormant aneurysms (4 middle and 2 anterior cerebral arteries). Seven of 8 patients were operated on again to exclude their aneurysms from the cerebral circulation. Two of 8 patients died postoperatively (1 within 24 hours and another 51 days after discharge from the hospital in a vegetative state). Fragments penetrating temporal, temporoparietal, or pterional areas had a significantly greater chance of causing arterial injury (chi 2 = 11.46, P less than 0.001). There was a significant chance of having an aneurysm if a hematoma was seen at operation or on computed tomography of the head (chi 2 = 4.18, P less than 0.05). The penetrating mode of injury and shell fragments crossing the midline were two variables for which the statistical significance had a P value of 0.08. It is concluded that war casualties with penetrating shell fragment injuries near the pterion, especially when harboring intracerebral hematomas, should undergo cerebral angiography to rule out vascular injuries of the brain.\r"

Now, with the advent of computed tomographic scanning with metrizamide in the subarachnoid space, the accuracy has been greatly improved. With computed tomographic scanning, the type and level of the lesion can be demonstrated, even when the myelographic study is unclear. Our report describes the case of a 38-year-old man with multiple thoracic intervertebral disc herniation, who also exhibited symptoms of spinal cord compression. Computed tomographic metrizamide myelography clearly showed anterior compression of the spinal cord due to disc herniation at T5-T6, T6-T7, T7-T8, T8-T9, and T9-T10. Removal of the herniated discs was followed by interbody fusion using autogenous bone grafts, and excellent results were obtained.\r"

A 50-year-old woman presented with nausea, vomiting, and global dysphasia, followed by two generalized seizures. Examination was otherwise normal, and computed tomography showed a small area of enhancement near the left sylvian fissure; there was a left temporal focus on the electroencephalogram. Treatment with phenytoin was instituted, and speech improved, with residual fluent dysphasia. Three days postictally, the patient complained of \"echoing voices\" in her right ear. Words or fragments of sentences recently uttered by the patient or others were perceived to recur unaltered for minutes to hours. Sounds other than speech were also affected. One week later the voices had disappeared, but a ticking sound was present; this also faded subsequently. The palinacousis never recurred; the patient was later found to have a Grade IV astrocytoma of the left temporal lobe, which caused her demise 8 months later. The features of this case are similar to those previously reported and favor an epileptic etiology. Palinacousis should be recognized as a sign of organic temporal lobe disease and not confused with manifestations of psychotic illness.\r"

Teflon vocal cord injection has been shown to restore the sphincteric action of the larynx and enable patients to phonate and swallow properly again. Nine patients underwent this procedure for chronic aspiration and hoarseness. All had vagus injury attributable to antecedent intracranial operation, and all experienced relief of their symptoms with only minor complications. Teflon vocal cord injection is advocated as a safe, effective means of managing patients with aspiration and dysphagia secondary to vagus nerve injury.\r"

We intend to alert the neurosurgeon to important side effects, but not to assess the long term efficacy of the procedure. Postoperatively, a number of transient effects were seen in our patients, the most striking being somnolence, delusions, and lack of significant pain in spite of a large abdominal incision. The only complications have been respiratory. After the early postoperative period, gradual improvement of on-off times and Schwab-England disability scores was seen over 20 weeks. Long term cooperative studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure. neurosurgeons doing transplant operations are urged to join the registries so that uniform information can be collected.\r"

Most lesions were less than 10 mm in diameter. All were clinically silent. Two patients developed major enlarging MRI lesions (seen in three slices) which increased in size over 2 months and then gradually became smaller over 2 months, leaving behind small residual areas of abnormality. There were 36 follow-up scans, 17 of which (47%) showed evidence for increasing activity. Thirteen (36%) of the scans had new lesions, most of them being small. This study shows that MRI evidence for disease activity in MS is much more frequent than is clinical evidence.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that levodopa can both acutely improve as well as worsen motor function was investigated in eight fluctuating parkinsonian patients by administering 2-hour infusions of placebo and of levodopa at suprathreshold, threshold, and subthreshold rates when the subjects had been without medication overnight. Plasma levodopa and clinical status were monitored for an hour before, during, and for 3 hours after the infusions. Placebo infusions were associated with a mild deterioration in motor status during the period of monitoring. Subthreshold infusions were associated with greater motor deterioration than were placebo infusions in five of six subjects, but this deterioration did not occur in any specific temporal relation to the infusion. Threshold infusion rates in three subjects produced a transient improvement in motor function followed by deterioration to below the scores during the hour preceding the infusion and then returned to baseline. Suprathreshold rates in seven of the eight subjects were associated with motor improvement for 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours followed by worsening to below baseline for 30 to 90 minutes and then spontaneous improvement to baseline function. These observations suggest that levodopa causes an acute deterioration in motor function following drug-induced improvement. Thus, the nadir of motor function in levodopa-treated patients may not be simply loss of dopaminergic stimulation and return to the untreated state, but may represent an inhibitory effect of levodopa.\r"

Both whites and blacks had a similar excess of PD death rates for residents of the four northern census regions of the US over their rates for the three southern regions. Within each region the sex and race differences remained. Thus, blacks in the US appear to be \"protected\" against PD, but they share the north: south gradient seen for whites.

Each subject had generalized convulsions, recent abstinence from alcohol abuse, and no obvious etiology for seizures other than alcohol withdrawal. Patients with only focal seizures, major head injury, coma, or a severe toxic-metabolic disorder were excluded. We recorded history and signs of minor head injury, presence of headache, level of consciousness, neurologic signs, routine medical examination findings, and subsequent clinical course. Sixteen patients (6.2%) had intracranial lesions on CT. Eight had subdural hematomas or hygromas, two had vascular malformations, two had neurocysticercosis, and one each showed a Berry aneurysm, possible tumor, skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and probable cerebral infarction. In ten cases (3.9%), clinical management was altered because of the CT result. History or signs of minor head trauma, headache, level of consciousness, or focal neurologic signs did not significantly correlate with CT abnormality.\r"

In the four control rabbits, mean AGR was 3.1 mumol glucose equivalents/g wet weight/min (standard error of the mean, 0.6), a figure in close agreement with earlier studies by workers using other techniques. AGR depended much more on carbohydrate availability as expressed by terminal blood glucose than on the shock-conditioned state of the glycolytic system reflected by individual rate constants of lactate accumulation. Regardless of shock history, AGR rose with blood glucose as though it were limited only by substrate availability. The unique capability of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to obtain chemically specific time course data noninvasively made these observations possible. The method has considerable potential for further analysis of normal and deranged cerebral metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "We measured cerebral perfusion at rest and in response to CO2 in eight patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), using the 133xenon inhalation method to determine the effect of large-vessel occlusive disease on vasoreactivity. We studied three other groups for comparison, including four with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusions (BICAO), 11 with unilateral carotid occlusion (UICAO), and six with unilateral middle cerebral artery stem occlusion (UMCAO). Resting flows appeared to correlate with the severity of occlusive disease overall. Normocapnic perfusion was lowest in the group with BICAO and decreased in proportion to the degree of contralateral stenosis in the group with UICAO. Hypercapnic perfusion correlated with the apparent adequacy of angiographic collaterals. Reactivity was lowest in the MMD group (0.79%/mm Hg) whose collateral supply was limited to leptomeningeal anastomosis from the posterior cerebral artery, but highest in the patients with BICAO (2.72%/mm Hg), each of whom showed excellent posterior communicating artery flow. The clinical course of the MMD group was compatible with the syndrome of perfusion insufficiency with repeated ischemic attacks or a saltatory progression of an ischemic deficit; CT showed infarction in the borderzone territory. These results suggest that a severely reduced hypercapnic response may help to identify patients with ischemic syndromes due to perfusion failure in the borderzones, as in MMD.\r"

Regression lines relating intimal to medial area in diabetics and controls had a common slope, but the line for diabetics was at a higher intercept. We found no direct association between increase of intima and severity of nerve fiber degeneration. These studies indicate that intima is increased in arterioles in diabetes, due primarily to proliferation of intimal cells. The increased intima, and possible resulting decrease of nerve perfusion, may contribute to development of diabetic polyneuropathy.\r"

Mild motor impairment was confirmed by the smaller thenar muscle action potentials and isometric muscle twitches from supramaximal stimulation of the median nerve. Sensory impairment was supported by the increased thresholds of vibratory (p = 0.003) and touch-pressure (p = 0.004) detection thresholds of the pulp of index fingers and decreased amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials. A tactile hemidigit localization test revealed that localization was not significantly different from that on the contralateral side but perceptual territory was increased. This increase is best explained by misdirected axon regrowth without CNS adaptation. Long-standing faculty tactile digit localization in neurovascular skin flaps from finger to thumb also was demonstrated--further evidence that CNS adaptation is imperfect when sensory nerves to digits are relocated.\r"

In intercostal nerves displaying no morphologic signs of acute neuronal degeneration, two-dimensional gels showed modifications of the group of beta tubulins and abnormal spots of proteins, some appearing to be closely related to tau proteins. These results suggest that microtubule proteins are modified in ALS before ultrastructural axonal degeneration, but the significance of these abnormalities remains hypothetical.\r"

In the 19-year period the average mortality rate was 0.83 per 100,000 per year. The disease was more common in men, in individuals aged 50 to 70 years, and in residents in rural areas engaged in agricultural work. A retrospective case-control study, confirming a significantly higher frequency of MND in farmers and persons living in rural areas, revealed that the disease was more common in the lower social classes to which most unskilled and heavy laborers belong. In addition, a significantly increased risk for MND was found in patients with previous histories of trauma, but confounding variables may account for this association.\r"

The effects of methamphetamine abuse on pregnancy outcome and embryofetal development are not known. In this study, we compared pregnancy and fetal outcome in 52 women who abused methamphetamines with a randomly selected control group of 52 non-drug-abusing women. Body weight, length, and head circumference were significantly decreased in neonates born to mothers who abused methamphetamines during pregnancy. However, the frequency of congenital anomalies was not significantly increased in this group.\r"

Therefore, we analyzed retrospectively the fate of infants whose mothers took ethanol for threatened first- or second-trimester abortion in 1968-1973. One hundred thirty-six patients were given an average of 38 g of ethanol (10-120 g) per day for two to 34 days, whereas 103 comparable patients received no ethanol treatment. The immediate and long-term effects on each woman's offspring were followed from birth to age 14. No infant had typical fetal alcohol effects. Fetal growth and the rates of fetal/neonatal deaths and anomalies were similar in both groups. Furthermore, there was no difference in postnatal growth and development. Thus, ethanol treatment as once prescribed for threatened abortion evidently did not cause fetal damage.\r"

To answer this question, we analyzed the responses of 341 gynecologists to a survey consisting of clinical vignettes using a new statistical technique, conjoint analysis. The patient factors found to be statistically significant (all P less than .00005), in order, were age, parity/timing, and race. Other significant factors (all P less than .05) were marital status, family income, and educational level. Within those factors, physicians were most willing to sterilize older, postpartum, parous, black, married, poor, or well-educated women. Groups of physicians analyzed by age, gender, race, practice locale, practice type, religion, and religiosity were remarkably similar in their ordering. By a separate analysis, physicians were more willing to sterilize a diabetic woman than a woman in good health. This study supports the conclusions that factors including age, parity, timing, race, and health influence some gynecologists' decisions to sterilize and that not all gynecologists are willing to sterilize all patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the concentration of fibronectin in amniotic fluid and gestational age. Amniotic fluid samples, obtained from 54 women whose pregnancies ranged in gestation from 15-40 weeks, demonstrated a significant decrease in fibronectin levels with increasing duration of pregnancy (r = -0.70). Diminished concentrations of amniotic fluid fibronectin in the latter stages of pregnancy may represent either decreasing synthesis by amniocytes or a dilutional effect from fetal urine.\r"

No significant differences were found between the age-normalized average bone densities of the menstruant, early postmenopausal, and late postmenopausal women; nor was there a difference between the rates of their bone loss. The bone densities of the hysterectomized women were significantly lower than those of the normals. The bone densities of the oophorectomized women were significantly lower than those of the hysterectomized patients. The rates of bone loss, however, were comparable in all groups studied. The use of estrogen without progestin was associated with significantly higher lumbar spine densities in the oophorectomized women, but showed no significant effect in any of the other groups.\r"

Cervical mucus scoring and tray agglutination test identified six women with sperm-agglutinating antibodies and seven women with cervical dysmucorrhea. All males were normozoospermic, with penetration into control cervical mucus and control uterine fluids. Control sperm penetrated into cervical mucus and uterine fluids of three and five of the women with sperm-agglutinating antibodies and cervical dysmucorrhea, respectively. Penetration of husbands' spermatozoa into uterine fluids of patients with sperm-agglutinating antibodies was lower than that of control semen (P less than .05). Control and husbands' sperm penetration into uterine fluids of women with cervical dysmucorrhea were identical. In both groups, husbands' and control sperm penetrated uterine fluids more frequently than cervical mucus (75 versus 12%; P less than .001). On a six-month follow-up and midcycle intrauterine inseminations, six patients (46%) conceived. We conclude that uterine fluids of patients with sperm-agglutinating antibodies and cervical dysmucorrhea may provide a better milieu for spermatozoa than cervical mucus. This observation suggests a rationale for intrauterine inseminations to achieve pregnancy.\r"

In order to evaluate histologic features that might be useful in establishing the diagnosis of an intrauterine gestation, we conducted a retrospective review of 150 endometrial curettings obtained from women with incomplete abortions or ectopic pregnancies. The specimens were divided into three groups: 1) intrauterine gestations with villi, 2) intrauterine gestations without villi, and 3) known ectopic pregnancies. Differences in the histologic appearance of the endometrium between intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies were evaluated, with emphasis on 34 curettings from intrauterine gestations in which no chorionic villi were identified and 12 curettings from ectopic gestations. Histologic features assessed in these 46 cases included the presence of intermediate trophoblastic cells; caliber, thickness, and hyalinization of spiral arteries; the presence of a fibrinoid matrix; the Arias-Stella phenomenon; decidua; inflammation; and thrombosis. Intermediate trophoblast in vessels and/or decidua was recognized by conventional light microscopy in 14 (41.2%) of 34 intrauterine cases with no villi, but was identified by immunoperoxidase reactions for hPL in 24 (70.6%) and keratin in 20 (58.8%) of these cases. Endometria from intrauterine gestations also demonstrated a significant increase in arterial wall thickness, hyalinization and lumen diameter, and thrombosis when compared with the endometria associated with ectopic pregnancies. Intermediate trophoblast, enlarged hyalinized spiral arteries, and fibrinoid matrix were not seen in any of the ectopic pregnancies. Based on these findings, intrauterine implantation can be diagnosed, in the absence of villi, by the presence of intermediate trophoblast associated with enlarged vessels replaced by hyaline, or with fragments of fibrinoid matrix.\r"

Substance P, a potent polypeptide that is released into the eye after trigeminal nerve stimulation, may be the cause. In rabbits, topical application of nitrogen mustard causes a rise in IOP which is blocked by capsaicin, a presumed substance P depletor. In the present study, six eyes of three cynomolgus monkeys underwent extracapsular lensectomies. After 2 to 3 months, capsaicin was administered by retrobulbar injection on one side of each animal, and vehicle on the contralateral side. One day later, Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomies were performed using 31 mJ (total energy) per eye. Diurnal IOP measurements were made before and after the retrobulbar injections and the capsulotomies. Ten weeks later, laser capsulotomies were repeated using 200 mJ/eye without pretreatment with any potential blockers. None of the six eyes, each undergoing two separate capsulotomies 10 weeks apart, showed a postoperative rise in IOP. These results demonstrate that the cynomolgus monkey is a poor model for studying IOP elevation that often occurs following Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.\r"

Following subconjunctival administration of 1 mg of FUMP to 13 New Zealand white rabbits, the tissue drug level at the injection site was significantly greater in the group treated with liposomes than it was in the group not treated with liposomes (p = .02). These liposomes offer the potential for sustained release of FUMP in the eye. By controlling the rate of drug release, it may be possible to reduce the need for frequent drug administration and its associated ocular toxicity as well as to improve treatment efficacy.\r"

In addition, respondents reported inadequate eye care services and a scarcity of literature on the topic. Refugee health organizations often overlook the need for eye care, and blindness prevention agencies are often unaware of the needs of particular refugee communities.

The aim of this study was to investigate if it was possible to reduce postoperative phantom limb pain by giving lumbar epidural blockade (LEB) with bupivacaine and morphine for 72 h prior to the operation. 25 patients were interviewed about their limb pain before limb amputation, and about their phantom limb pain 7 days, 6 months and 1 year after limb loss. 11 patients, of mean age 77 years (52-93), received an LEB, so that they were pain-free for 3 days prior to operation. The control group, 14 patients of mean age 73.4 years (63.86), all had preoperative limb pain. Seven days after operation, 3 patients in the LEB group and 9 patients in the control group had phantom limb pain (P less than 0.10). After 6 months all patients in the LEB group were pain-free, whilst 5 patients in the control group had pain (P less than 0.05). After 1 year, all the patients in the LEB group were still pain-free, and 3 patients in the control group had phantom limb pain (P less than 0.20). Preoperative lumbar epidural blockade with bupivacaine and morphine reduces the incidence of phantom limb pain in the first year after operation.\r"

However, there is little objective evidence of its effectiveness and the mechanisms which may cause these effects are unknown. In a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial we examined the contribution of placebo and massage effects in ultrasound therapy following bilateral surgical extraction of lower third molars. Four to 6 h after surgery the patients (25 per group) received either no therapy, US (0.1 W/cm2), 'mock' US with massage, 'mock' US without massage, or 'self-massage' with a dummy applicator. Facial swelling, trismus, serum C-reactive protein, serum cortisol, pain and anxiety were measured 24 h postoperatively. The results showed that the beneficial analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of US therapy were placebo-mediated, with maximum effect in the placebo ('mock' US) group without circular massaging with the applicator). Self-massage by the patient produced no significant effect. This placebo action was independent of changes in serum cortisol or patient anxiety state. US therapy can significantly reduce postoperative morbidity, but by placebo-mediated mechanisms which are unrelated to the US itself.\r"

  ".W": "The long half-life and wide inter-patient variability in clearance of methadone make this drug difficult to use optimally. If a patient's methadone clearance is known, however, dose regimens can be devised to maintain any desired blood concentration and hence, since the effect of methadone is related to its concentration in the blood, pain relief. We investigated methods for determining methadone clearance. In 25 patients, clearance was estimated by monitoring blood methadone concentrations following an intravenous infusion. Estimates of clearance adequate for clinical purposes could be obtained by assaying only 10-12 blood samples collected over 30 h following the infusion. The blood sampling schedules were such that it was not necessary to collect samples during the night, so the procedure could be done on an outpatient basis. An advantage of this procedure is that it also allows estimation of the blood methadone concentration required to relieve pain. We also conducted a retrospective study of data from 185 patients whose methadone clearance we had determined, to identify factors which may give rise to the large inter-patient variation in clearance. Clearance tended to be high in patients taking phenytoin, spironolactone, verapamil or oestrogens, and low in patients taking amitriptyline. Patients with malignant disease as opposed to chronic benign pain, and patients 65 years of age or older, tended to have low clearance. Clearance was positively associated with haematocrit. An equation was constructed allowing methadone clearance to be predicted from knowledge of these factors. The predicted clearance, however, showed only a moderately strong correlation with measured clearance (r = 0.75), indicating that factors not investigated also had a major influence on methadone clearance.\r"

Self-efficacy was operationalized as patients' ratings of their ability to perform movements, while response expectancies were operationalized as ratings of the degree of pain expected to accompany the movements. Patients predicted their ability to perform 10 simple movements and the degree of pain that would accompany each movement; on a separate occasion, subjects' actual performance of the movements was assessed. In general, independent predictions of both movement ability and pain correlated significantly with performance of specific movements as rated from videotapes. Total movement scores correlated 0.55 and -0.54, respectively, with total self-efficacy and pain response expectancy ratings. Expectancy ratings were also predictive of average daily pain ratings and questionnaire ratings of physical impairment in everyday life. Multiple regression analyses, including causal modeling, indicated that actual performance was best predicted by self-efficacy ratings, which in turn appeared to be determined by pain response expectancies.\r"

Microinjections of the neuroexcitatory agent, L-glutamate (0.5 M), were directed at the marginal layers, at the central magnocellular portion, and at the deep magnocellular portion of Vc. Changes in the plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), in mean arterial pressure, and in heart rate were examined. Glutamate excitation of neurons within the marginal layers of Vc evoked a significant (+143 +/- 52 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) increase in plasma ACTH during the 10 min postinjection sampling period. Glutamate injections into the deep magnocellular portion of Vc also increased plasma ACTH (+97 +/- 28 pg/ml, P less than 0.05), whereas activation of neurons in the central magnocellular portion of Vc had no consistent effect on plasma ACTH (-25 +/- 29 pg/ml, P greater than 0.10). Arterial pressure increased transiently after glutamate injections into the marginal layers or central magnocellular portion of Vc, whereas injections into the deep magnocellular portion of Vc did not affect arterial pressure. Heart rate increased transiently regardless of the laminar site of injection within Vc. These data indicate that activation of neurons in laminar regions of Vc that process nociceptive information cause an increase in plasma ACTH, whereas activation of neurons in laminae of Vc that process mainly non-nociceptive input have no significant influence on plasma ACTH.\r"

Both a single dose of clomipramine (10 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally (i.p.) and chronic clomipramine treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 7 days) induced antinociception. When morphine (5 mg/kg), given subcutaneously (s.c.), and clomipramine were combined, an increased antinociceptive effect compared to morphine alone was observed in all tests. In the increased temperature hot plate test and in the formalin test increased antinociception was also observed when morphine was combined with chronic clomipramine treatment. In the constant temperature hot plate test no additional effect compared to morphine alone was observed when morphine and chronic clomipramine treatment were combined. These results indicate that clomipramine has an antinociceptive effect in itself, and that it may enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine. The differences between the tests indicate that different nociceptive mechanisms are involved, and that the combination of clomipramine and morphine may be beneficial for some types of nociceptive stimuli, but not for others.\r"

The approach of examining the effects of morphine on spinal cord nociceptive transmission in the presence and absence of spinal cord conduction has led to conflicting conclusions. We have compared the effects of morphine on the rat tail-flick reflex (TFR) in lightly anaesthetized animals in the presence and absence of a spinal cord cold-block. Morphine, administered systemically, was found to be more potent in increasing the latency of the reflex when the spinal cord conduction was present. However, when low doses of morphine were injected intrathecally, morphine was more potent when spinal cord conduction was blocked. These data indicate that systematically administered morphine, at low doses, has a supraspinal site of action in prolonging the onset of the TFR. Conflicting results on this issue do not appear to be due to plasticity changes following spinal cord section or lesions, psychological stress in conscious animals or the presence of tonic bulbospinal inhibition.\r"

The combination of morphine and pentazocine produced a level of analgesia significantly greater than can be accounted for by simple addition of the analgesic effects of each opiate analgesic alone.

The results showed that in animals with grafted nerve stumps, autotomy begins significantly later than in those with single sciatic section. However, when the self-mutilation started, it followed the same increasing evolution in both groups. These results suggest that autotomy after a nerve section is behaviour related to the aparition and nature of the terminal neuroma.\r"

Using stratified random assignment, 159 subjects were assigned by grade and class to one of three groups. Subjects in the first experimental group were taught about their internal bodies using a multisensory teaching method employing anatomic dolls. A cognitive-perceptual teaching method using two-dimensional drawings was used with the second group. The third group served as controls. Posttesting was done at 1 and 6 weeks postintervention using recall and recognition memory approaches. A multisensory teaching approach was shown to be significantly, p less than .001, more effective than a cognitive-perceptual teaching approach at both post-testings by both measurement methods. Memory retention of children enmeshed at varying levels of preoperational thought was not significantly different, regardless of teaching method used.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical model hypothesized to predict family functioning was tested in four groups of expectant parents, followed by exploratory model building. The groups studied during the 24th to 34th weeks of pregnancy included 153 high-risk hospitalized women, 75 of their partners, 218 low-risk women from the general obstetric clinic, and 147 of their partners. Both partners in the high-risk situation reported greater discrepancy in family functioning than partners in the low-risk situation. The hypothesized models proved to have low explanatory power, accounting for 13% to 15% of the variance. The final empirical models developed explained 33% of the variance in family functioning among high-risk women and 48% among their partners, 23% among low-risk women, and 32% among their partners. The empirical models differed from the hypothesized models in that variables postulated to have only indirect effects were shown to have direct effects on family function and inter-generational variables significantly expanded the theoretical model.\r"

Relationships between these causal dimensions and expectancy for future success in weight control were tested using 260 faculty and staff in two collegiate settings. Subjects were placed in outcome (success or failure) groups, depending on whether they reported weighing what they desired (success) or more than they desired (failure). Personal habits related to food and activity were perceived as the major causes of weight outcomes, although success subjects frequently chose inherited or physiological factors. Weiner's stability-expectancy proposition was supported by increased expectancy after success when stability was rated higher, and after failure when stability was rated lower, R2 = .40.\r"

Blood pressure, triceps skinfold thickness, and fasting venous specimens for lipid profiles were collected during a home visit. Teachers rated children's Type A-B behaviors using the Matthews Youth Test for Health (MYTH) (Matthews & Angulo, 1980). For statistical analyses, one member of each twin pair was assigned to Group I and the co-twin to Group II. In Groups I and II, significant, p less than or equal to .01, negative correlations between the impatience-aggression component of TABP and atherogenic lipids were observed before and after covariate adjustments. Children were classified as MYTH Type A or B on the basis of a median-split. Marginally significant differences (B greater than A) were found between the mean lipid levels of Type A and Type B children. No significant A-B differences in blood pressure or measures of obesity were observed in either group. Multivariate analysis of variance results suggested that lipid profiles in Group I differed significantly, p less than or equal to .02, by Type A-B classification. The results of this study suggest that TABP and its components are not positively associated with physiological risk factors for CVD; and the impatience-aggression component of TABP is associated with lower levels of atherogenic lipids.\r"

Cell six and nine were identified as being the most important foci for evaluating the process of collaboration. Groups that used the process to evaluate collaboration can use the information both for decision making and for data collection in the evaluation effort. Objectives of the project frame the purposes of the evaluation. In this case, the purposes were to evaluate effectiveness of the collaboration process/model for both education and practice, and to make recommendations for the next steps. In the best of circumstances, process evaluation should occur at the same time that the process is taking place. Sometimes this approach is not feasible when there is insufficient time or resources, and then alternative designs need to be developed. For example, it is conceivable that a retrospective descriptive survey could capture the essence of the communication, mutuality, and shared resources experience. Hypothetical statements or predictions assist in the process of maintaining clarity about what one really wants to measure or study to ensure that the focus and purposes are commonly understood, measureable, and worthwhile. Objective evaluation is facilitated when the level of measurement is appropriate and the results generated are in concert with the intended purposes. The use of this framework proved its worth after the data were collected and analyzed. It was found that the collaborative process was worthwhile, and that the outcomes of the collaboration were appropriate and meaningful and the goals had been achieved. Recommendations for follow-up flowed neatly from the data analysis and from a general discussion by participants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Some investigators have suggested that the hazards of anabolic steroids may be overstated in the diseased population and are minimal or absent in healthy subjects. Yet, many questions are unanswered. Current data do not link life-threatening side effects with intermittent use of anabolic steroids. However, many concerns remain. Dangerous situations include use of anabolic steroids by adolescents, preadolescents, and persons with liver or heart disease and use of oral compounds in high doses for long periods. A coordinated team approach (with representatives from sports, medicine, advertising, and the pharmaceutical industry) is needed to determine the real risks of anabolic steroids to athletes who are considering their use.\r"

One hundred twenty children, ages 4 through 7 years, were filmed while rising from a supine position. Movement patterns were classified using categorical descriptions of the action of three body regions: the upper extremities, lower extremities, and axial region. The incidence of each movement pattern was calculated and graphed with respect to age. Age differences were found in the incidence of movement patterns of each body region. A trend toward increased symmetry of movement with increasing age was noted. The oldest subjects, however, did not commonly use symmetric form in rising. Developmental change in movement patterns used in the rising task likely continues beyond early childhood.\r"

The same infants were tested at 3 days and again at 40 weeks postgestational age. Data obtained were compared to evaluate changes with age. Results showed that all infants had organized movement as determined by high interjoint correlations and small phase lags. Movement durations were restricted at 550 and 765 msec for flexion and extension, respectively. Amplitude, velocity, pause durations, and joint angles differed among infants. Infant leg movements are highly organized synergies not disrupted by postnatal events. Differences in movements are attributed to dynamic interaction of elements in the motor control system in real and developmental time. Similar studies on high-risk or sick preterm infants may provide clues to early detection of neuromuscular dysfunction.\r"

Degrees of ROM were determined from the pelvic-tilt angles obtained. The intraclass correlation coefficient was .95 for standing pelvic-tilt angle, .93 for the anterior pelvic-tilt angle, .93 for the posterior pelvic-tilt angle, .88 for the anterior pelvic-tilt ROM, .93 for the posterior pelvic-tilt ROM, and .90 for the total pelvic-tilt ROM.

The NNE consists of 27 items divided into three sections: 1) tone and motor patterns, 2) primitive reflexes, and 3) behavioral responses. Each section consists of 9 items scored on a three-point scale. Fifty-four healthy full-term infants were examined at 2 days of age and demonstrated total NNE scores ranging from 70 to a maximum possible score of 81 (X = 76, s = 1.03). Mean section scores for these infants ranged from 25.3 to 26.6 (s = .59-1.79). Intertester agreement was 88% by item and 95% by total score in each section. Two hundred ninety-eight high-risk infants were then examined at 37 to 40 weeks conceptional age (gestational age plus chronological age) or at discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, whichever occurred first. Total NNE mean scores for high-risk infants fell into discrete clusters by conceptional age at the time of examination (37-42 weeks, mean score = 66.5; 34-36 weeks, mean score = 60.7; less than 34 weeks, mean score = 51.1). Similar clustering occurred for the three section scores. Highly significant differences existed between the three conceptional age groups for total scores and section scores. No clinically significant score differences were associated with severity of illness or gestational age at birth. The results of this study suggest that the NNE easily and reliably assesses infants' neonatal neurobehavioral status at a given conceptional age. Additional studies are in progress to determine the value of the NNE in predicting subsequent developmental disabilities.\r"

Criteria for SIJD were established by the authors. Twenty-six patients with unilateral LBP were examined independently for presence of SIJD by two examiners. Interrater agreement for presence or absence of SIJD was found to be excellent (Cohen's Kappa = .88). Twenty of the patients who met the criteria for SIJD were randomly assigned to an Experimental Group (n = 10) or a Control Group (n = 10). The left and right innominate bones of these 20 patients were measured for tilt before and after the intervention period. The sacroiliac joint of the patients in the Experimental Group was manipulated during the intervention period, whereas the patients in the Control Group received no treatment. Data were analyzed using a mixed three-factor analysis of variance. The data analysis revealed that the manipulation procedure resulted not only in an altered innominate tilt of the same side but also in an equal and opposite tilt of the opposite side (F = 67.07; df = 1.18; p less than .05). The results indicate that SIJD can be identified reliably in patients with LBP and that a manipulative procedure purported to be specific to the sacroiliac joint changes innominate tilt bilaterally and in opposite directions.\r"

Pelvic inclination was assessed by determining the angle of standing pelvic tilt (SPT) with an inclinometer. Autonomic tone was assessed by a measure of cardiac vagal tone (amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia) derived from monitoring heart rate. Thirty-two subjects, preselected for exhibiting an anteriorly tilted pelvis, were randomly assigned to either an Experimental Group (n = 16) that received a 45-minute Rolfing pelvic mobilization session or a Control Group (n = 16) that received a 45-minute control session without manipulation. Dependent variables were assessed before the 45-minute session, immediately after the session, and 24 hours later. Comparing pretest to posttest assessments, the Experimental Group demonstrated a significant decrease in SPT angle and a significant increase in vagal tone. The Control Group did not show significant pretest or posttest differences. The results provide theoretical support for the reported clinical uses of soft tissue pelvic manipulation for 1) certain types of low back dysfunction and 2) musculoskeletal disorders associated with autonomic stress.\r"

In seven communities of different sizes, we measured distances from a designated parking space to commonly frequented sites (eg, stores, post offices, banks, and medical buildings). We also measured street widths and the time allowed by crossing signals to cross streets safely. From these data, we calculated the velocities needed to safely cross streets in each community. The study results showed that ambulation distances and velocities vary depending on the size of the community and that for individuals to function independently within their community, they must ambulate at velocities and distances much greater than the ambulation objectives that may be set at most rehabilitation settings. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that they receive the majority of their patients to more accurately prepare patients for functional independence after rehabilitation discharge.\r"

In both conditions, the subject's vital capacity and the amount of time of unassisted ventilation were recorded.

The cleft side of the lip was shorter than the normal side in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Freeing the muscle from its dermal insertions, splitting it, and advancing it into the medial side of the cleft lengthened the cleft side of the lip vertically and horizontally. The Z-plasty skin repair further lengthened the cleft side of the lip in the vertical dimension. The lengthening effect of the muscle repair appears to be the result of the loose skin redraping over the dissected muscle and further explains elimination of the orbicularis bulge and superior scar formation in the functional cleft lip repair.\r"

Skeletal analysis of the mandible revealed a variable and inconsistent degree of vertical elongation with posterior displacement of the chin. Operative correction of the cleft lip lower-lip deformity required evaluation of both the soft-tissue and skeletal abnormalities. Soft-tissue procedures gave permanent correction, provided there was a normal maxillary-mandibular relationship. Skeletal correction alone did not completely rectify the abnormal lower-lip posture.\r"

Results from a 2-year clinical nasoendoscopy data base are presented. Ninety-eight patients were referred for evaluation of velopharyngeal function during speech. Flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopic evaluations were conducted in 85 patients. Patients ranged in age from 3 years to adult. Eighty-nine percent of the evaluations were completed successfully on a first attempt. A standard format has been designed to communicate the results of nasoendoscopic examinations to primary and tertiary care providers. Nasoendoscopy has become an integral part of our cleft team care and is used routinely for decisions regarding palatal management, fabrication and fitting of palatal prostheses, and treatment of resonance disorders following pharyngeal flap surgery.\r"

Our findings indicate that the morphology of the orbital region is a more important and reliable method of evaluating a predisposition to developing dry eyes postoperatively than is the Schirmer's test. The value of the Schirmer's test is to flag patients prior to blepharoplasty, but it should not be relied on as the sole method of screening patients and it is definitely of less importance than the history and physical examination.\r"

We performed a historical cohort study to estimate the point prevalence of this potential complication sometimes referred to as \"human adjuvant disease.\" Three-hundred and seventy-eight patients who underwent augmentation mammaplasty with silicone-containing envelope-type prostheses from 1970 through 1981 were surveyed. Regional musculoskeletal syndromes, fibrositis, or osteoarthritis occurred in a third (38 of 125) of our responders. No patient developed an inflammatory systemic rheumatic disease during the period of observation (mean 6.8 years for the 125 subjects). Using calculations based on risk for development of rheumatic disease, it does not appear likely that augmentation mammaplasty is a significant or major inducer of inflammatory connective-tissue diseases in general. However, the number of patients surveyed was small, and our results must be considered preliminary. We could not exclude a specific risk for the development of scleroderma.\r"

The intersection of the midshoulder (anterior iliac) spine line with the inframammary fold offers a reference point for horizontal localization of the nipple. The nipple-suprasternal notch length, the diameter of the areola, and the nipple-inframammary fold length are determined by the height of the patient and the size of the brassiere cup. On this basis, a table for breast reduction can be drawn up that gives these dimensions for a given height and size of brassiere cup. Other important factors include the stretch direction of the skin and the course of the nerve to the nipple. A distinction is made between radial segment conization and anterior tangential conization. Criteria and measurements were incorporated into a technique comprising anterior tangential excision of glandular tissue and limited inferior radial segment excision of skin.\r"

When this technique is applied both to macromastia and breast asymmetry, excellent early results are reported. To study the effects of time on breast reduction, 22 patients were followed for an average of 4.7 years. Contour of the breast mound and projection are well preserved. However, evaluation of long-term results reveals a gradual increase in the inframammary fold to inferior areola distance. Since no increase in the midclavicle to nipple distance is observed, inferior migration of the breast parenchyma and superior displacement of the nipple-areola with respect to the breast mound occur after reduction mammaplasty with the inferior pedicle technique.\r"

Anatomic variations were the rule in the six cases of transverse absence and the three cases of symbrachydactyly, requiring nerves, tendons, and vessels in the toe be connected to whatever appropriate structure could be located. All transfers survived, and only one required exploration. Sensation appeared good in the 11 seen in later review, but interphalangeal motion was achieved in only 3. However, good use was made of the digit by all except one patient, an early patient in whom there was not an adequate skeleton on which to base the transfer. This small series suggests that in appropriate cases toe transfer can be undertaken early for congenital deficiency with little fear of encountering microsurgical problems unique to the infant.\r"

The ability of radiation-treated fibroblasts to attach to the substrate and form colonies was less than that of unirradiated cells. Irradiated skin fibroblasts from the four patients had significantly longer mean generation times than did control cells. During log-phase growth (1 to 9 days), the population doublings of damaged cells were significantly reduced compared to colonies from normal cells. These data suggest a permanent intrinsic radiation effect on fibroblasts or a selective ablation of faster-growing fibroblast subpopulations that is not dependent on decreased blood supply.\r"

MR is less optimal than CT for the assessment of intrinsic bone abnormalities. Myelography and CT have, as their chief advantage relative to MR, short data acquisition times. Consequently, MRI has the problem of image degradation from patient motion. The advent of gadolinium-DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast agent (following FDA approval) is expected to increase the sensitivity of MR further in defining neoplasms arising from intramedullary, intradural-extramedullary, and extradural locations. In view of the ability of multiplanar MR to demonstrate neoplasms that affect the spinal cord, the use of sedation and pain medication protocols appears justified. Moreover, to eliminate intrinsic artifacts arising from cardiac pulsation, respiration and CSF flow, MR imaging must utilize advanced techniques such as flow compensation and cardiac gating.\r"

The high soft-tissue sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for the frequent detection of such cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled spaces. Especially on axial images, these CSF-filled perivascular spaces may be confused with pathologic lesions, such a lacunar infarcts. Postmortem brain specimens demonstrate the anatomy of perivascular spaces around perforating arteries. Orthogonal images in the living patient help confirm this anatomic relationship. The characteristic CSF signal patterns from these foci are further evidence of their anatomic identification and true benign nature.\r"

Imaging studies consisted of a single 1-cm sagittal section obtained with a spin-echo technique through the center of the spinal column. The T2s of the lumbar vertebral body and nucleus pulposus and the area of the latter were measured. In both vertebrae and disks, there was a significant decrease in T2 after bed rest. The nucleus pulposus also decreased in size with bed rest. The decrease in relaxation time of the lumbar vertebrae could be explained by the replacement of hematopoietic marrow by fatty marrow, a known consequence of paralytic immobilization. The decreases in size and T2 of the disks probably represent loss of water. The significance of these changes to the mechanical integrity of these structures after immobilization or space flight is not known but will depend in part on whether changes are progressive with increasing length of immobilization and on the rate and extent that they are reversed after reambulation. These results indicate that relaxation times can be altered by simple disuse, which often accompanies the underlying disease.\r"

Three important pathologic findings--myelomalacia, total thrombosis, and wall thickening of the draining vein--were clearly demonstrated at MR imaging and confirmed at autopsy. A flow-sensitive sequence was valuable in the depiction of one intramedullary AVM as hyperintense, the postoperative evaluation of AVM, and the differentiation of nidus from old intramedullary hematoma. In other AVMs, cord edema, periradicular hematoma, and reversible changes of cord scalloping after surgery were demonstrated.

In each case, the frequency with which individual segmental and subsegmental bronchi were seen was established, as were variations in branching patterns. All basilar segmental bronchi were identified except in one case in which images of the left lung were obscured due to respiratory and cardiac motion. In the right lung, a division into subsegmental bronchi was identified in 84 of 150 (56%) visualized segmental bronchi. Six separate patterns of basilar segmental subdivision were found. In the left lung, subsegmental bronchi were identified arising from 51 of 145 (35%) visualized segmental bronchi. Five separate patterns of bronchial subdivision were found in the left lung. It is concluded that thin-section CT allows precise identification of all basilar segmental bronchi and, consequently, can play a significant role in the cross-sectional evaluation of lower lobe bronchial and parenchymal abnormalities.\r"

Assessment of enhancement and clinical activity in both studies revealed that enhancement was observed in 13 of 14 cases in which clinical activity had changed within 4 weeks of the study and thus appeared more sensitive than clinical examination in determining active disease. The 3-minute postinjection, short repetition time image (TR) was the most efficient for depicting enhancement. Enhancing lesions (active plaques) arose from previously hyper- or isointense regions on long TR images. Previously active lesions reverted to areas of iso- or hyperintensity on long TR images. Serial comparison of long TR images in this population reveals a decrease in high-intensity lesions on long TR images in some cases and an increase in others. The findings of high-intensity regions on long TR images and previously enhancing lesions both becoming isointense suggests that transient inflammatory changes with concomitant edema without demyelination and/or with significant remyelination may occur in some MS lesions. MS lesions are dynamic; both active and inactive lesions may show dramatic change on longitudinal MR imaging studies.\r"

The object of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed after the administration of gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) in evaluating residual or recurrent tumor. Precontrast T1-weighted, intermediate, and T2-weighted images were obtained at a field strength of 1.5 T. Gd-DTPA was then injected intravenously in a dose of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight. T1-weighted images were obtained within 5 minutes after the injection, intermediate and T2-weighted images were obtained 10 minutes after the injection, and T1-weighted images were obtained approximately 20 minutes after the injection. None of the patients experienced allergic reactions or other side effects. Physical examination findings and laboratory values were unchanged after the Gd-DTPA-enhanced examination. In six patients, contrast-enhanced images depicted tumor not suspected on nonenhanced images. In four other patients, enhanced images provided better definition of the tumor core. The images of one patient with a brain stem tumor showed no evidence of enhancement. Pre- and postcontrast images of three previously treated patients showed no evidence of tumor. Gd-DTPA appears to be a safe and effective contrast agent for MR imaging and provides a more accurate method of imaging in the follow-up of brain tumors in pediatric patients.\r"

Bowel-wall thickening was the most reliable sign of disease. Five of six patients (83%) with bowel-wall thickness greater than 1 cm had neoplastic disease. Nine of ten patients (90%) with bowel-wall thickness between 3 mm and 1 cm had inflammatory disease, while four of six patients (66%) with wall thickness less than 1 cm and increased attenuation of mesenteric fat or an increase in the number of mesenteric vessels had noninflammatory edema. The presence of mesenteric masses was not a helpful sign for differentiating various disease processes. The results of this retrospective study suggest that the identification and classification of small bowel disease in children is possible from the objective analysis of CT findings.\r"

Images of the chest and abdomen were obtained for up to 60 minutes with a scintillation camera interfaced with a computer. In all patients, images of the liver and/or lungs were observed within 5-10 minutes and became clear with time. In patients without liver disease, only liver images could be obtained, whereas the lung was visualized with or without the liver in all patients with liver cirrhosis. The portosystemic shunt index was calculated by dividing counts of lungs by counts of liver and lung. These values were significantly higher in liver cirrhosis, especially in the decompensated stage. Transrectal portal scintigraphy with IMP appears to be a useful method for noninvasive and quantitative evaluation of portosystemic shunting in portal hypertension.\r"

For ten subjects, two series of axial MR images were obtained with identical parameters except that RSPE was used in one and GMN in the other. Images were evaluated by three independent radiologists, and region-of-interest measurements were obtained to calculate signal-difference-to-noise ratios (SD/Ns) for liver versus gallbladder and liver versus the right kidney. Maximum ghost intensity and the standard deviation of motion-induced noise were also calculated. GMN was superior to RSPE for motion artifact reduction in all ten cases. The SD/N for liver versus both gallbladder and right kidney was significantly higher with GMN. Presaturation pulses applied outside the volume of interest reduced aortic and inferior vena cava signal and virtually eliminated artifact from these vessels but did not noticeably affect signal from intrahepatic vessels. GMN combined with presaturation pulses is a highly effective method of motion artifact reduction in the upper abdomen.\r"

  ".W": "Because the cost of managing an expected greater number of adverse reactions when high-osmolality contrast media (HOM) are used could offset the higher material cost of low-osmolality contrast media (LOM), a prospective study was done of 795 inpatients undergoing any of four procedures involving intravascular injection of HOM: cardiac catheterization, peripheral angiography, head computed tomography (CT), or body CT. The resources used in managing HOM-induced adverse reactions were measured, and the costs of these resources were estimated. Four hundred five patients (51%) had adverse reactions. Reactions were grouped into three classes according to their severity. Class 1 (mild) reactions occurred in 358 patients (45%), class 2 (moderate) reactions occurred in 44 patients (6%), and class 3 (severe) reactions occurred in three patients (0.4%). Ninety-nine patients (12%) consumed resources as a result of an adverse reaction. The average cost of these resources per patient undergoing examination was $1.07 to the radiology department, $5.83 to the hospital, and $12.93 to a charge-paying insurer. Mean (+/- standard deviation) cost to the hospital for managing class 1, class 2, and class 3 reactions were $2.52 +/- $5.33, $24 +/- $54, and $910 +/- $749, respectively. By comparison, the difference in material cost of HOM versus LOM ranged from $93 for body CT to $179 for cardiac catheterization. Even if LOM were to induce no adverse reactions, the increased material cost associated with universal substitution of LOM for HOM would be greater than the expected cost of managing adverse reactions when HOM are used.\r"

The transverse plane was optimal, and a 5-mm section thickness was preferable. Estrogen stimulation affected the appearance of the vagina: The contrast between the vaginal wall and the central mucus-containing area was greatest during the early proliferative and late secretory phases. MR imaging offers unique depiction of congenital anomalies and should be used when results of physical examination or other radiologic studies, such as ultrasound, are inconclusive.\r"

In the remaining 76 patients, CT demonstrated 194 new sites of disease and disproved 25 suspected sites of disease. The use of CT scans changed the staging of disease in 20 patients, 16 of whom had extranodal extension. The effect of using CT findings on treatment depended on whether radiation therapy was used, and, if so, which treatment protocol was followed. The use of CT findings would have changed the treatment in 6.5%-62.7% of new cases of Hodgkin disease. The authors recommend that CT scans be obtained in all patients with Hodgkin disease, especially those with abnormal chest radiographs.\r"

MR accuracy for demonstrating metastatic cancer was 92%, sensitivity was 95%, and specificity was 90%. Tumor extension to the vagina was reliably excluded (negative predictive value = 97%), but false-positive interpretations occurred (positive predictive value = 84%) primarily because inflammation (n = 2) and congestion (n = 2) could not be distinguished from tumor invasion. An additional role of MR imaging was the ability to differentiate tumor from fibrotic tissue in patients with suspected recurrent vaginal carcinoma. The overall accuracy of MR imaging for recurrent vaginal cancer was 82% (14 of 17).\r"

No additional shimming was necessary when the center of the field of view selected for the CSI experiment was located at or near isocenter. The promising results obtained with this approach make the CSI method an attractive choice of spatial localization method.\r"

In the detection of AVN, MR imaging is more sensitive than computed tomography or nuclear scintigraphy. This study assessed the usefulness of MR imaging in the differentiation of AVN from other hip diseases. Twenty-two cases of non-AVN hip disease were matched with 23 biopsy-proved cases of AVN and ten normal controls. MR images were rated in a blinded manner by five experienced radiologists, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on the data. In the discrimination of AVN from other hip diseases or from normality, the A(z) value (the area under the ROC curve) was 98.6. With a specificity of 98%, MR imaging was 97% sensitive in the differentiation of AVN from normality, 85% sensitive in the differentiation of AVN from non-AVN disease, and 91% sensitive in the differentiation of AVN from both conditions. MR imaging may therefore help discriminate between AVN and other hip diseases.\r"

In three cases, prominent intramedullary areas of high signal intensity were noted on T2-weighted images obtained within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms.

In this study, radiographic evidence of these findings was not associated with clinical failure. This is in distinction to the findings in cemented prostheses, in which many of these phenomena (especially the development of increasing width of the lucent line adjacent to the cement or prosthesis) have been associated with failure. Long-term investigations of porous-coated prostheses are necessary. Currently, however, an awareness of the radiographic alterations that occur with asymptomatic bone-ingrowth prostheses can prevent their misinterpretation as abnormal.\r"

Surgery was performed in 22 patients (69%). Each case was classified radiographically and surgically as normal or a type 1, type 2, or type 3 rupture. The sensitivity and specificity of CT were 90% and 100%, respectively, while those of MR imaging were 95% and 100%. The accuracy in detecting ruptures was 91% for CT and 96% for MR imaging. The overall accuracy, which reflected the percentage of cases correctly diagnosed as well as those correctly classified, was 59% for CT and 73% for MR imaging. Although the differences between the CT and MR imaging parameters were not statistically significant (possibly due to the small population), the results suggest that MR imaging is the method of choice for detecting ruptures of the posterior tibial tendon. MR imaging provided greater definition of tendon outline, vertical splits, synovial fluid, edema, and degenerated tissue. CT was superior to MR imaging in showing associated bone abnormalities such as periostitis, subtalar osteoarthritis, and subtalar dislocation.\r"

A test set of 200 conventional and 200 SER radiographs of phantoms containing either one nodule or none was interpreted by four radiologists attempting to detect a nodule and indicate a confidence value. Their ability to detect nodules positioned over the lung was slightly improved with SER compared with conventional radiography (sensitivity, .56 vs .70); for nodules over the mediastinum or diaphragmatic areas, it was much improved (sensitivity, .29 vs .64). The results were also analyzed with receiver-operating characteristic methods, which revealed a significant improvement in lesion detect-ability over the thicker body parts with SER images. The capability of equalized chest radiographs to provide improved lesion detectability suggests that SER may set a new standard for film-based chest radiography and have a large clinical application.\r"

With the use of a randomized complete factorial design, four factors were examined. Each agent was used at one of three dose levels. For radiation, these were 5, 15, and 25 Gy; for hyperthermia, 42 degrees C for 15 minutes, 43 degrees C for 30 minutes, and 44 degrees C for 60 minutes. Two sequences (hyperthermia plus irradiation and irradiation plus hyperthermia) and five time delays between agents (0, 12, 24, 48, and 120 hours) were used. The growth delay (the time it took for the initial tumor volume to double) of subcutaneously implanted tumor served to quantitate treatment effect. Significant (P less than .05) statistical interactions were observed for several combinations of factors and individual factors. Hyperthermia plus irradiation was more effective than irradiation plus hyperthermia except at the delay time between treatments of 0 hours. Peak growth delay occurred when the time between treatments was 0-24 hours and depended on agent doses. Many combinations produced therapeutic synergy.\r"

It involves the passage of a tapered, movable-core, J-tipped guide wire across the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery followed by the advancement of a straightened Grollman pigtail catheter. The technique was successful in 34 of 34 pulmonary artery catheterizations. The method avoids prolonged catheter manipulation within the right ventricle. In addition, since the catheter does not cross the tricuspid valve until the guide wire has been advanced, the occasional complication of the pigtail \"hooking\" on a tricuspid valve leaflet or chordae tendineae during catheter withdrawal and manipulation is prevented.\r"

The wide variation in absorption thickness of different parts of the chest results in areas of under- and over-exposure. An advanced multiple-beam equalization system, AMBER, controls local exposure delivered to the film. The system has a row of 20 modulators in front of the x-ray tube, each able to change the height of the local slit beam during scanning. Changes are made in response to measurements from a linear detector array in front of the film cassette. This array consists of 20 individually functioning detectors coupled through electronic feedback loops to the 20 modulators. A scan is obtained in 0.8 second with a local exposure time of approximately 50 msec. AMBER results in radiographs with significantly improved exposure of the mediastinum without overexposure of the lungs.\r"

For 1 year, 8-week periods during which chest radiographs were digitized and made available to MICU physicians on a digital display console were alternated with 8-week periods during which only film images were available. Clinical efficacy during the periods was compared by measuring the time between completion of imaging examinations and initiation of specific clinical actions such as placement and positioning of tubes. Results indicate that the time required to take some clinical actions decreased with the immediate availability of images on the digital display console. Established procedures for obtaining radiologic information were altered by the digital imaging network. The time at which physicians viewed images changed, and consultations between MICU staff and radiologists decreased. These results indicate that behavior patterns are altered when a new technology replaces an existing one. Optimal use of this technology may require changes in the logistics of clinical practice.\r"

Assessment at mammography of the response of 60 breast cancers in 59 women was performed between 1974 and 1986. Responses were excellent in 13 tumors, moderate in 34, and poor in 13 (excellent moderate = 78%). Assessment of response of discrete masses in a fatty breast was easiest; assessment of response of tumor areas that were poorly defined-such as a focal area of architectural distortion or mass in dense breast parenchyma-was more difficult. Of 17 patients with excellent pathologic responses-that is, minimal or no residual tumor-15 (88%) had complete responses (no residual tumor) as determined with mammography, physical examination, or both. Mammography provides information complementary to physical examination and is essential in the accurate assessment of the response to chemotherapy of locally advanced breast cancer.\r"

Mammograms of 108 malignant tumors (74 scirrhous tumors, 17 partially scirrhous nodular tumors, and 17 nodular tumors) and eight benign tumors that showed peritumoral fat were retrospectively evaluated. All the scirrhous and partially scirrhous nodular cancers were more or less surrounded by a 5-10-mm-wide hyperlucent halo; this corona sign was also found in 14 nodular cancers. The halo sign, a hyperleucent 1-mm band, was observed around all benign lesions and immediately adjacent to sharply delineated cancers. These radiologic findings are an optical illusion (Mach band, background contrast effect). Densitometric measures and isoluminous analysis did not demonstrate the presence of a true hyperlucent zone.\r"

The technique is based on locally perturbing the magnetization of the myocardium with selective radio-frequency (RF) saturation of multiple, thin tag planes during diastole followed by conventional, orthogonal-plane imaging during systole. The technique was implemented on a 0.38-T imager and tested on phantoms and volunteers. In humans, tags could be seen 60-450 msec after RF saturation, thus permitting sampling of the entire contractile phase of the cardiac cycle. Tagged regions appear as hypointense stripes, and their patterns of displacement reflect intervening cardiac motion. In addition to simple translation and rotation, complex motions such as cardiac twist can be demonstrated. The effects of RF pulse angle, relaxation times, and heart rate on depiction of the tagged region are discussed.\r"

Sixteen patients had bilateral disease; thus, there were 114 endangered limbs and 145 diseased vessels, including 19 with a single stenosis, 94 with multiple stenoses, and 32 with total occlusions. Primary anatomic success was achieved in all stenosed vessels and in 28 occluded vessels. Initial limb healing without amputation was achieved in 88% of limbs. In four patients occluded vessels could not be recanalized; thus, the four affected limbs were amputated. Two years after PTA, 32 of 37 patients available for follow-up had viable pain-free extremities. Cumulative limb salvage rate at 2 years was 86%. At this time, below-the-knee PTA is still recommended only for limb salvage candidates. However, with this new catheter and guide wire system, success rates have been increased and complication rates decreased. PTA may be useful in selected patients with severe claudication.\r"

Twelve separate sessions of angioplasty were performed, during which 15 of 16 diseased tibial runoff vessels were successfully dilated. Three complications occurred during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). One was related to the concomitant use of a thrombolytic agent to open a femoropopliteal bypass graft and not related to the angioplasty itself. No limbs were lost as a result of complications. The procedure was a technical success in nine of 12 cases (75%) and an initial clinical success in eight of the nine that were technically successful (89%). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 22 months. Six of the nine cases (67%) remained clinically successful during this period.

The parotid or extraparotid nature of these masses was established by identifying a fat plane between the mass and the parotid gland. This was more reliably accomplished with MR imaging than with CT. Although dynamic CT allowed identification of the glomus tumors, MR imaging also permitted diagnosis of these lesions. The inherent CT and MR imaging characteristics of most of the neuromas and minor salivary gland tumors were indistinguishable. However, the neuromas tended to displace the internal carotid artery anteriorly, whereas the salivary lesions displaced this vessel posteriorly. This artery was better identified on MR images than on CT scans. Thus, these lesions, which are the four most common primary parapharyngeal space tumors, can be distinguished on MR images by evaluating not only their inherent signal characteristics but also the surrounding fat planes and any displacement of the internal carotid artery.\r"

Four additional types of nucleus pulposus were identified in this study. The transitional type (type II) of childhood had fibrous tissue that developed near the anulus fibrosus anteriorly or posteriorly. MR images showed a notch of reduced signal intensity in the nucleus pulposus where the fiber was developing. The adult type (type III), which is predominant after age 30 years, had an indistinct boundary between the nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus. MR images showed the fibrocartilage in the nucleus pulposus and inner anulus fibrosus as areas of high signal intensity. Adult disks with a tear of the anulus fibrosus (type IIIB) had a lower signal intensity on MR images and slightly reduced disk heights. This type may represent an early stage of degeneration. Degenerated intervertebral disks (type IV) had either dense disorganized fibrous tissue or fluid replacing the normal fibrocartilaginous structure of the nucleus pulposus. MR images showed narrow intervertebral disk spaces with either reduced signal intensity if collagen was present or increased signal intensity if fluid was present. This study suggests that the nucleus pulposus may progress normally through types I, II, and III.\r"

Primary demographic factors affecting population dynamics include social structure, life history variation caused by environmental fluctuation, dispersal in spatially heterogeneous environments, and local extinction and colonization. In small populations, inbreeding can greatly reduce the average individual fitness, and loss of genetic variability from random genetic drift can diminish future adaptability to a changing environment. Theory and empirical examples suggest that demography is usually of more immediate importance than population genetics in determining the minimum viable sizes of wild populations. The practical need in biological conservation for understanding the interaction of demographic and genetic factors in extinction may provide a focus for fundamental advances at the interface of ecology and evolution.\r"

Extracts prepared from S phase cells were ten times more efficient at initiating replication at the SV40 origin than were extracts from G1 cells, whereas elongation rates were similar in G1 and S reactions. At a discrete point in the cell cycle, just before the cell's entry into S, an activity appeared that was required, in conjunction with SV40 T antigen, for site specific initiation at the SV40 origin. This factor had a role in unwinding DNA at the replication origin.\r"

Recent work indicates that an autosomal dominant gene for Alzheimer's disease is located on chromosome 21 at band q21. In the present study of a group of autopsy-documented kindreds, no evidence for linkage was found between familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and chromosome 21q21 markers (D21S1/D21S72 and the amyloid beta gene). Linkage to the D21S1/D21S72 locus was excluded at recombination fractions (theta) up to 0.17. Linkage to the amyloid gene was excluded at theta = 0.10. Apparent recombinants were noted in two families for the amyloid gene and in five families for the D21S1/D21S72 locus. These data indicate that FAD is genetically heterogeneous.\r"

When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps.\r"

The efficiency of transfer depended upon binding mode and driving force. For a given donor-acceptor pair, surface-bound complexes showed greater rate enhancements than those that were intercalatively bound. Even in rigid glycerol at 253 K, the rates for donor-acceptor pairs bound to DNA remained enhanced. For the series of acceptors, the greatest enhancement in electron-transfer rate was found with chromium, the acceptor of intermediate driving force. The DNA polymer appears to provide an efficient intervening medium to couple donor and acceptor metal complexes for electron transfer.\r"

Because oxygen is a powerful quenching agent for phosphors, the transition from well-perfused liver to anoxia (no flow of oxygen) resulted in large increases of phosphorescence. During stepwise restoration of oxygen flow, the phosphorescence images showed marked heterogeneous patterns of tissue reoxygenation, which indicated that there were regional inequalities in oxygen delivery.\r"

Of four site-directed antibodies tested, only antibodies against the short intracellular segment between homologous transmembrane domains III and IV slowed inactivation, and their effects were blocked by the corresponding peptide antigen. No effects on the voltage dependence of sodium channel activation or of steady-state inactivation were observed, but the rate of onset of the antibody effect and the extent of slowing of inactivation were voltage-dependent. Antibody binding was more rapid at negative potentials, at which sodium channels are not inactivated; antibody-induced slowing of inactivation was greater during depolarizations to more positive membrane potentials. The peptide segment recognized by this antibody appears to participate directly in rapid sodium channel inactivation during large depolarizations and to undergo a conformational change that reduces its accessibility to antibodies as the channel inactivates.\r"

  ".W": "Tobacco is the most widely used addictive substance in the world. Since the Surgeon General's 1964 report, medicine has sought out the genesis of tobacco addiction (TA) and has evolved methods of treatment and prevention. Psychiatry was slower than other medical specialties to acknowledge TA as a legitimate area for psychiatric intervention, probably because the many psychiatrists who were smokers identified with their smoking patients. Since 1980, the American Psychiatric Association has recognized nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal as diagnostic entities. The complications of TA are in the province of other medical specialists, but psychiatrists have unique tools for treating addictive disorders. This paper describes some of the addictive qualities of tobacco, and presents illustrative cases of successful treatment of TA using hypnosis. It describes an effective cooperative community program under medical aegis, focusing on education, therapy, and prevention, which has resulted in the virtual disappearance of tobacco consumption in hospitals and schools in the community. By sharing their expertise in the treatment of individual patients, and the design of effective community programs that include education, prevention, and treatment, psychiatrists will be active leaders in the medical community's program to reduce tobacco addiction.\r"

The most common first site of distant spread was bone (51%), followed by lung (17%), brain (16%), and liver (6%). The remaining 10% of patients had multiple metastatic sites. Fewer than 10% of the entire group received adjuvant chemotherapy after primary treatment. When metastatic disease appeared, most patients had palliative systemic chemotherapy and/or irradiation. In general, patients with initially negative axillary nodes had a longer median time until relapse (development of metastatic disease) and a longer survival time after diagnosis of metastases than patients with initially positive nodes. Liver was the least common initial metastatic site; while liver metastasis was seen only in patients with positive axillary nodes, it carried the worst prognosis. The overall median survival time after metastasis was 12 months for bone and lung lesions, three months for brain lesions, and only one month for liver metastasis. The median survival of patients with multiple metastatic sites was 7.5 months. No correlation was found between time until relapse and survival after metastasis. Patients in whom distant metastases developed relatively soon after the initial diagnosis had the same postmetastatic prognosis as patients whose disease metastasized later. No correlation was found between age at initial diagnosis and metastasis-free interval or survival after metastasis.\r"

The study group consisted of 253 inmates who had cosmetic procedures between 1982 and 1984 and who were released from prison between the time of operation and the end of 1986. The recidivism rates, calculated by life table analysis, were 8% at one year, 17% at two years, and 25% at three years. All were significantly less than baseline (P less than .01, P less than .001, P less than .01). The rates for those who had been incarcerated for violent crimes were 3.3%, 7.7%, and 15.0% (all P less than .001). We conclude that a positive relationship exists between cosmetic surgery and criminal rehabilitation, as measured by a decrease in recidivism.\r"
