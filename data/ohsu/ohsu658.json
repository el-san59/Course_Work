  ".W": "The management of acute croup syndrome has undergone very interesting changes in the past century. Initially a number of conditions were thought to be synonymous with croup, but with identification of the bacterial and viral etiology these have been separated into different clinical entities: viral croup which is very common and frequently self-limited; bacterial tracheitis, a condition which is infrequently encountered and which may be a complication of viral croup; and epiglottitis or supraglottitis, a disease that has been identified as most frequently due to a specific organism, H. influenzae. The management of the child with airway obstruction has also changed. Before the past decade virtually all children with epiglottitis were treated with tracheotomy and currently very few children are thus treated. Intubation has been showed to be a safe procedure in these cases. There still exists some controversy regarding the treatment of the child with laryngotracheobronchitis. In the vast majority of cases medical management has been successful and in the remainder there is controversy regarding the use of intubation or tracheotomy.\r"

In addition to communicative difficulties, children with undetected or misdiagnosed hearing impairment can suffer intellectually, socially, emotionally and/or behaviorally. There is little reason, however, for infants or children with hearing impairment to go without accurate assessment because the pediatric audiologist is now armed with reliable test techniques for virtually every child. This paper is a review of some of the behavioral and physiological methods used by the audiologist to identify and describe the hearing of infants and children. Also included are suggestions for the pediatrician about when it is appropriate to request the help of the audiologist in evaluating an infant or child at risk for or with suspected hearing loss.\r"

Captopril significantly lowered (p less than 0.01) mean arterial blood pressure in seven patients (Group 1) and was ineffective in five (Group 2). In Group 1, a marked decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels in both the supine (from 5.5 +/- 0.5 to 2.8 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) and the upright positions (from 17.5 +/- 4.7 to 3.9 +/- 1.6 pg/ml; p less than 0.0025) and a significant increase in platelet angiotensin II levels (from 10.5 +/- 5.3 to 22.4 +/- 17 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) after captopril treatment was observed. In Group 2, no variation was found in plasma angiotensin II levels, whereas platelet angiotensin II levels increased slightly (from 10.8 +/- 3.1 pg/ml to 16.9 +/- 5.2 pg/ml; NS). These findings suggest that the decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels can lead to an increase in platelet angiotensin II receptors or can lead to angiotensin II production in platelets through activation of a feedback mechanism. The second hypothesis suggests that platelets have alternative enzymatic pathways leading to angiotensin II production not inhibited by captopril.\r"

Blood pressure, basal and post-ischemic \"maximal\" forearm blood flow (strain-gauge venous occlusive plethysmography), and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index were measured in 28 hypertensive patients (WHO class I or II, 23 men and five women, aged 26 to 59 years). Minimal vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure/peak blood flow) was taken as an index of vascular structural changes. The same measurements were made in a group of 14 patients before and after long-term antihypertensive treatment: in eight patients after six and 12 months of treatment with captopril (50 mg twice a day, plus 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day if necessary) and in six patients after six months of treatment with nitrendipine (20 mg per day, plus 50 mg of atenolol per day if necessary). A significant but weak direct correlation was found between the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.41) or minimal vascular resistance (r = 0.31). Thus, patients were categorized according to whether they had left ventricular hypertrophy or impaired blood flow; the results suggested that left ventricular hypertrophy may be detected earlier than increased minimal vascular resistance. After six months of treatment, both captopril and nitrendipine significantly reduced left ventricular mass index and minimal vascular resistance. Left ventricular mass index was normalized in 50 percent of the patients, whereas minimal vascular resistance was normalized in one patient only. After 12 months of treatment, left ventricular mass index was normalized in all patients; minimal vascular resistance was on the average further reduced but normalized in only one additional patient. Thus, regression of cardiovascular structure also seems to occur earlier in the heart.\r"

In addition, supine and standing plasma catecholamine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were measured. Examinations were performed during a placebo period and after three, six, and 12 months of captopril treatment. Blood pressure was significantly reduced (p less than 0.001), but heart rate did not change. Left ventricular hypertrophy was progressively reduced during treatment, mainly through reduction of left ventricular wall thickness. After one year, all patients had a normal left ventricular mass index (less than 120 g/m2). Before and during treatment, left ventricular systolic function, at rest and on maximal hand grip and cold pressor testing, evaluated on the basis of fractional shortening as related to end-systolic stress, was within the 95 percent confidence limits (calculated in a group of 25 normal subjects) in all 15 patients with essential hypertension. The percent increase in left ventricular dimensions during the diastolic rapid filling phase was significantly increased by treatment (p less than 0.05), indicating improvement of left ventricular relaxation. As expected, plasma renin activity was increased, plasma aldosterone levels were decreased, and plasma catecholamine concentrations did not change. These results indicate that long-term treatment with captopril has beneficial effects on left ventricular anatomy and function in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

The survival status of 105 patients with moderately severe heart failure who participated in a multicenter, double-blind comparison of captopril and placebo therapy was ascertained on an intention-to-treat basis. During the 90-day double-blind portion of this study, 21 percent (11 of 52 patients) of placebo-assigned patients died compared with four percent (two of 53 patients) of captopril-assigned patients (p less than 0.01). In addition, six previously published studies that provided comparative mortality data were identified. In one of these, the survival rate was reported to be improved in those who received captopril; in the other five studies, no conclusion could be drawn with respect to survival since death was an infrequent event within all treatment groups. Mechanisms by which captopril may improve survival include its favorable effects on hemodynamic parameters, its association with reduced ventricular ectopic activity, and its inhibitory effects on the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems.\r"

Cold pressor testing was performed in 15 normotensive subjects and 15 hypertensive patients before and 90 minutes after captopril administration. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before testing and at one-minute intervals from the beginning of cold pressor testing. Systolic time intervals were also assessed before and after testing. Captopril did not affect pressor responses to cold pressor testing in normotensive subjects or hypertensive patients. Basal heart rate (before testing) did not change, despite the decrease in blood pressure and showed a smaller increase in response to cold pressor testing in normotensive subjects, suggesting that captopril might interfere with arterial baroreflexes. The systolic time intervals were not modified by captopril except isometric contraction time; its basal value was reduced by captopril in both normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. Cold exposure caused a similar increase in isometric contraction time before and after captopril in normotensive subjects, and the increase in isometric contraction time in hypertensive patients was greater. These findings suggest that captopril did not affect cardiac performance, indeed improving it, at least in basal conditions.\r"

The blood pressure, plasma catecholamine, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone responses to a single dose of sublingual captopril in 23 patients with hypertensive emergencies were evaluated. The major correlation found was between the captopril-induced decrease in blood pressure and the decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.57, p less than 0.01). In another 11 hypertensive patients with normal or high renin levels, captopril lowered by 65 percent the increase in plasma norepinephrine induced by cold immersion of the forearm. In both circumstances, plasma renin and aldosterone levels changed in accordance with the expected inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. These data suggest that, in selected circumstances in hypertensive patients, captopril exhibits a depressive influence on sympathetic activity along with the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

Patients were examined after one and three weeks and, subsequently, at monthly intervals for a total period of four months. The dosage was adjusted to a maximum of 50 mg twice a day plus, when needed, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Thirty-two patients were lost to follow-up, 10 withdrew because of inadequate control of blood pressure, and only 21 (2 percent) dropped out because of side effects. Mean blood pressure decreased from 184/104 to 152/87 mm Hg. The lowest dosage (25 mg a day) was sufficient to control blood pressure in 15 percent of patients, 31 percent needed 50 mg a day, and 24 percent required 100 mg a day. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to the captopril regimen in 30 percent. No substantial changes in biochemical variables or electrocardiographic results were observed. \"Quality of life\" (judged as physical fitness, positive well being, mood, and sexual desire) remarkably improved.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty hypertensive diabetic patients (10 with type I and 10 with type II) were treated with captopril, 50 mg twice a day, for three months. The drug was effective as monotherapy in 16 patients. An additional nine months of follow-up was obtained in 12 of these patients (four with type I and eight with type II) who did not need the addition of diuretics to achieve normal blood pressure. For these patients with long-term treatment, since there was no substantial difference between those with type I and those with type II, the data were pooled. Mean arterial pressure significantly decreased shortly after treatment was begun and the reduction was maintained. No significant change was induced by captopril in urine volume, osmolar clearance, and serum and urinary values of sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium, whereas significant reduction was found in fractional excretion of potassium and phosphate. The baseline levels of proteinuria were only slightly elevated, yet they fell in all patients during treatment. All patients maintained satisfactory control of carbohydrate metabolism, and none of them required substantial changes in hypoglycemic treatment. The administration of captopril as monotherapy appears to be an effective and safe way of lowering blood pressure in diabetic hypertensive patients, even in the long term, without effects on renal function and in carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "In 27 hypertensive patients already receiving antihypertensive treatment and with serum total cholesterol levels between 260 and 350 mg/dl, captopril in a dosage of 50 mg twice a day was substituted for one of the drugs they were taking. Patients taking a diuretic continued the same diuretic at the same dosage. After six months of therapy that included captopril, patients resumed their former therapy. Diet and physical activity remained unchanged during the study. Biochemical and blood pressure determinations were performed before captopril was begun, after three and six months of captopril therapy, and three months after the former therapy was resumed. During the regimens that included captopril, the triglyceride value was reduced from 249 to 184 mg/dl (p less than 0.05), the total cholesterol level decreased from 287 to 237 mg/dl (p less than 0.005), and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value rose from 40 to 51 mg/dl (p less than 0.005). The reduction in cholesterol was unrelated to blood pressure changes or to changes in serum triglyceride, glucose, or potassium levels. Treatment regimens that included captopril also induced a greater diastolic blood pressure reduction than regimens that did not include captopril. The antihypertensive efficacy of a therapeutic regimen that includes captopril, along with its favorable effect on lipid profile, could be useful in preventing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients.\r"

In the same tissues, local generation of angiotensin II has also been demonstrated. Neuropeptidergic brain angiotensin and local cardiac angiotensin participate in cardiovascular regulation. Inhibition of cardiac angiotensin II protects against deleterious arrythmogenic and metabolic effects of transient regional myocardial ischemia, and blockade of brain angiotensin II effectively lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It is surmised therefore that the therapeutic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, brought about by inhibition of local tissue angiotensin II generation in addition to their interference with the hormonal plasma renin-angiotensin system. This would help to explain their therapeutic efficacy in pathophysiologic conditions in which hypertension is associated with low plasma renin activity.\r"

  ".W": "The prevention or attenuation of the development of heart failure by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was examined in two animal models, spontaneously hypertensive rats and rats with myocardial infarction produced by coronary artery ligation. In 24-month-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats with marked left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac output was reduced despite an increase in ventricular volume, resulting in a greatly reduced ejection fraction. Treatment with captopril from 14 to 24 months of age maintained forward output and prevented ventricular dilatation so that ejection fraction remained normal; left ventricular hypertrophy regressed to levels observed in six-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats. In rats with moderate and large infarcts three months after ligation, left ventricular filling pressures were elevated, forward output was reduced, and ventricular volumes were greatly increased. Long-term therapy with captopril maintained filling pressures within normal limits and maintained forward output from a lesser dilated left ventricle to yield an ejection fraction that was elevated compared with that in untreated rats. Thus, the potentially deleterious remodeling of the left ventricle in heart failure, an extensive increase in mass and chamber volume, can be favorably altered by long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril) with salutary effects on hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor, but little is known of the effects of long-term activation of the renin-angiotensin system on coronary reserve in humans. The effects of exercise on coronary hemodynamics were determined in eight patients with mild essential uncomplicated hypertension, before and after treatment with furosemide (50 mg, to ensure activation of the renin-angiotensin system). Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by thermodilution technique, intra-arterial blood pressure was measured from the ascending aorta, and plasma renin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay. Oxygen supply and demand were derived (using coronary sinus blood flow multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen difference to equal oxygen supply and heart rate multiplied by the mean systolic blood pressure to equal oxygen demand) both at rest and during isometric exercise (handgrip to 50 percent of maximal effort for three minutes). The study was a single-blind crossover (furosemide versus placebo) design. Furosemide produced a significant reduction in coronary sinus blood flow, associated with an increase in coronary vascular resistance. Changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were insignificant. Slight reductions in plasma volume and mean right atrial pressure were observed. During isometric exercise, the increase in oxygen supply for a given increment in oxygen demand was attenuated by furosemide. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to this effect was determined by the short-term administration of 25 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Forty-five minutes after oral captopril, coronary reserve was restored to pretreatment values. In conclusion, furosemide modulates coronary reserve, and it is likely that this is because furosemide mediates activation of renin-angiotensin system, thus reducing the vasodilatory capacity of the coronary arteries.\r"

  ".U": "89116197\r", 
  ".W": "Acute myocardial infarction is associated with complex neuroendocrine changes, including release of arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Arginine vasopressin levels are maximal on admission, and subsequently fall even in patients in whom left ventricular failure develops. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine are at their highest on admission and return to the normal range in patients with uncomplicated infarction, but they remain significantly elevated in patients in whom left ventricular failure or late ventricular arrhythmias develop. In contrast to catecholamines and arginine vasopressin, plasma renin and angiotensin levels are within normal limits on admission in patients without complications but increase by the third day. Patients with left ventricular failure already have increased plasma levels of renin and angiotensin on admission, but further marked and persistent increases occur over the following days. All of the aforementioned hormones may interact to cause systemic or coronary vasoconstriction, which may have short-term adverse hemodynamic consequences. Furthermore, increased afterload may result in infarct expansion and left ventricular dilatation, which will impair left ventricular function still further. Interruption of the cycle of vasoconstriction and worsening left ventricular failure by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on the susceptibility of the heart to ventricular arrhythmias following ischemia, both in vitro and in vivo, were studied. In isolated rat hearts, captopril, administered either before or at the end of ischemia, reduced ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion after 15 minutes of local ischemia. Reduction of purine overflow, improvement in contractility, and increase in coronary blood flow occurred concomitantly. In vivo, a closed-chest pig model was used to determine the effects of captopril, administered at the end of ischemia and continued orally, on the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias during the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. Myocardial ischemia was induced by 60-minute inflation of a balloon catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Upon reperfusion, an accelerated idioventricular rhythm occurred, both in 10 untreated and in 10 captopril-treated animals. Creatine kinase levels during the reperfusion period were significantly lower after captopril treatment. Two weeks after the short-term experiments, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia could be induced with programmed electrical stimulation in six of eight surviving untreated pigs. In contrast, in none of the six surviving captopril-treated animals was ventricular tachycardia inducible. Thus, early intervention with captopril during the development phase of myocardial infarction may have beneficial effects on the subsequent development of ventricular arrhythmias. Salvage of ischemic myocardium, improvement in ventricular function, beneficial effects on coronary flow, and decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system may all contribute.\r"

Less is known about their effects in mild and moderate heart failure. Results at one year are presented about an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study on 94 outpatients in New York Heart Association functional class II and III. After a three-week period during which appropriate doses of digoxin were administered and a stable response to exercise was obtained, diuretic therapy was withdrawn if in use and captopril or placebo treatment was assigned randomly. The assessment of patients was performed by symptom history, clinical examination, New York Heart Association functional class, chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitoring, M-mode echocardiography, and bicycle exercise at the time of random selection and at specified times during a two-year follow-up. Preliminary data after one year suggest that patients receiving placebo may have a greater tendency to need diuretics and may improve New York Heart Association functional class less often than those receiving captopril. No statistically significant treatment differences were found for the noninvasive test results. Detailed analysis suggests that treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be more advantageous than that with placebo for some groups of patients. Investigations are under way to determine which patients might benefit most from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary receptors have been shown to modulate renin release in animals. However, their involvement in reflex control of renin in humans has never been unequivocally established. This report reviews data on the effects on plasma renin activity of maneuvers (lower body negative pressure and passive leg raising) that reduce and increase central venous pressure and cardiac diameter without affecting blood pressure and heart rate, thereby deactivating and stimulating cardiopulmonary receptors with little or no involvement of the arterial baroreceptors. In normotensive subjects, reduction in central venous pressure was accompanied by an increase in plasma renin activity that was similar to the increase observed during tilt that reduced central venous pressure to a similar extent. Conversely, an increase in central venous pressure was accompanied by a reduction in plasma renin activity. The increase in plasma renin activity that followed the reduction in central venous pressure was drastically attenuated in four patients who had undergone cardiac transplantation, along with other reflex effects (changes in forearm vascular resistance and plasma norepinephrine) of cardiopulmonary receptor manipulations. There was a modest reduction in the overall reflex changes in plasma renin activity in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension compared with normotensive subjects. However, patients with essential hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy showed marked attenuation of all reflex influences of the cardiopulmonary receptors. In five subjects, therapeutic regression of this structural alteration was associated with a clear improvement in the cardiopulmonary reflex. Thus, in humans, cardiopulmonary receptors exert an important reflex control of renin release. This control (which is due in part to receptors located in the cardiac walls) is moderately affected by a mild to moderate blood pressure elevation but is markedly impaired when the elevation produces structural alterations in the heart. Preliminary evidence, however, suggests that the cardiopulmonary reflex may be improved by a reduction in cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "When captopril was first introduced, it was used in high doses for severe hypertension, often in the presence of renal insufficiency, and side effects such as proteinuria, rash, neutropenia, and altered taste sensation were noted. Upon analysis, these effects were most commonly seen in patients with renal disease, autoimmune disease, or collagen vascular disease. These complications usually reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. In contrast, the growing use of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, for treating mild to moderate hypertension and the trend toward the use of lower doses has shown these agents to be well tolerated with a low frequency of troublesome adverse effects. In fact, the original spectrum of adverse effects has virtually disappeared with the use of lower doses in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In low doses, the converting enzyme inhibitors produce remarkably few incidences of symptomatic discomfort; the most common is skin rash, which often responds to dosage reduction. Cough and rare occurrences of angioedema have also been reported. Moreover, evidence is evolving that indicates that the converting enzyme inhibitors may sometimes decrease proteinuria and improve renal function; these effects may be especially important in diabetic hypertensive patients. Of note, these drugs can also attenuate the unwanted metabolic side effects of concurrent diuretic treatment.\r"

Under these circumstances, the adverse effects of conventional antihypertensive therapy with diuretics and beta-blockers assume great importance, especially hypokalemia and alterations in blood lipid levels. These metabolic changes can negate the benefit of lowered blood pressure. The adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs, especially on the quality of life of hypertensive patients, have recently received a great deal of attention. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are free of these adverse effects and may actually enhance the quality of life. They are effective antihypertensive agents when given in low doses, they can often be given once a day, and they are effective in all age groups. Combined with a diuretic they are effective in black and elderly hypertensive patients.\r"

This was initially accomplished with direct-acting vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, nitrates, and hydralazine. Subsequently, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been demonstrated to produce similar short-term hemodynamic improvement and have generally proved superior in their long-term hemodynamic and clinical efficacy. Although the ACE inhibitors were initially employed as adjunctive treatment in patients with refractory heart failure, recent studies indicate that they are also effective in patients with mild and moderate symptoms and that they are at least as effective as digitalis in this patient group. Furthermore, a growing body of data indicates that the ACE inhibitors improve the survival rate in patients with severe and, possibly, milder heart failure. As a result, the ACE inhibitors have emerged as useful agents in patients with mild symptoms and are being investigated for their potential to improve the survival rate and prevent clinical deterioration in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Using acetaldehyde concentrations of 5 and 10 mM, an acetaldehyde adduct with hemoglobin was formed in vitro, isolated, and characterized. However, a similar adduct could not be isolated in vitro using a pharmacological concentration of 100 microM acetaldehyde nor could this adduct be isolated in human alcoholic subjects.\r"

Phagocytosis mediated by the IgG Fc-receptor (Fc-R) was assessed in the MC immediately after isolation by using IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes as test particles. Experiments were also performed after preincubating the MC in medium containing 10% autologous serum with or without ethanol (80 mM) in vitro at 37 degrees C for 15 min, and with or without ethanol (80 mM) present during the internalization assay in vitro (37 degrees C for 60 min). MC from alcoholics exhibited lower phagocytic capacity via the Fc-R than MC from healthy controls, approximately 50% versus 70% phagocytosing cells. Preincubation of the MC in medium containing 10% autologous serum with 80 mM ethanol, reduced the percentage of phagocytosing MC from controls to 55%, whereas no further reduction occurred in cells from alcoholics. When present during the assays of Fc-R function, ethanol decreased MC phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles significantly in both test groups, to about 30% phagocytosing cells. Blood samples disclosed increased serum levels of markers of liver dysfunction, immunoglobulins, increased sedimentation rate, and white blood cell counts among the alcoholics, while their serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were reduced.\r"

  ".W": "We obtained alcohol use data and judgments of individual (\"What do you think?\") and cultural (\"What do people in general think?\") norms for normal and problem quantity and frequency of alcohol use, as well as ratings of whether particular alcohol-related behaviors indicated a drinking problem, from 928 adult respondents who were members of Hawaii's five major racial/ethnic groups [Chinese, European (Caucasian), Filipino, Hawaiian/Part-Hawaiian, and Japanese ancestry]. As compared with older survey data (but consonant with recent survey data), Hawaiians have substantially increased in alcohol use, as have Filipinos (if they drink at all; a high proportion are abstainers), and to a lesser extent, Japanese. Chinese remain very low in alcohol use, while Caucasians have relatively decreased in use. Alcohol use norms (especially of own judged normal use) vary across sexes and ethnic groups and are predictors of consumption both within and across groups. Family resemblances are substantial with regard to alcohol use category (present users, former drinkers, abstainers). Among present users, family resemblances are often significant with regard to amount used; resemblances are more substantial between mothers and offspring than between spouses or between fathers and offspring. There were small but significant ethnic group differences in the number of specific behaviors judged to be indicative of a drinking problem, with the groups reporting the highest mean alcohol consumption (Caucasians and Hawaiians/Part Hawaiians) also indicating more behaviors, particularly pathological as opposed to celebratory behaviors, as being problematic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fetal alcohol exposure has been shown to produce long-term feminizing and demasculinizing effects on male rat behaviors which are organizationally dependent upon perinatal androgen levels. Such exposure has previously been shown to suppress the normal surge of testosterone during the critical prenatal period. Since defeminization of male rat behavior is dependent upon estrogen derived from the aromatization of testosterone in brain, brain aromatase activity was measured during the perinatal period in males and females exposed to alcohol beginning on Day 14 of gestation. Aromatase activity was measured in whole hypothalamus of fetuses from Day 16 through 20 of gestation and in the hypothalamic preoptic area and amygdala of animals 6-12 hr postparturition. Hypothalamic aromatase activity was elevated in fetal alcohol exposed males compared to controls on Days 18 and 19 of gestation and on postnatal Day 1. No effect of prenatal alcohol exposure was found in females. A sex effect in aromatase activity in the amygdala was evident on Day 1 when activity was found to be greater in males than females. Overall, these findings indicate that fetal alcohol exposure will elevate regional brain aromatase activity in males, but not females during the perinatal period of neurobehavioral sexual differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro sulfation of mucus glycoprotein by sulfotransferase from rat submandibular salivary gland and the effect of ethanol on this enzyme activity was investigated. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that the enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate ester group from 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate to submandibular gland mucus glycoprotein is associated with Golgi-rich membrane fraction. The sulfotransferase enzyme exhibited optimum activity at pH 6.8 in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM NaF. The enzyme was equally capable of sulfation of the desulfated intact as well as proteolytically degraded desulfated glycoprotein preparations, whereas the acceptor capacity of the intact mucus glycoprotein was 70% lower. The submandibular gland sulfotransferase activity was inhibited by ethanol. The rate of inhibition of mucus glycoprotein sulfation was proportional to the concentration of ethanol up to 0.4 M, at which concentration a 39% reduction in the sulfotransferase activity occurred. The apparent Km value of the enzyme for salivary mucus glycoprotein was 11.1 microM, and the Kl in the presence of ethanol was 0.93 M. The synthesized 35S-labeled glycoprotein gave on CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation 35S-labeled peak which coincided with that of the glycoprotein. Alkaline borohydride treatment of this glycoprotein led to the liberation of the label into the acidic oligosaccharide alditol fraction. As the inhibition by ethanol of sulfotransferase enzyme occurred below its isosmotic concentration to plasma, the observed effect could also be detrimental to salivary mucus glycoprotein sulfation in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of a conditioning procedure to establish oral ethanol self-administration in free-feeding rhesus monkeys was assessed. The conditioning procedure required the monkey to drink an ethanol solution in order to have access to a sweet orange-flavored solution. Following an average of 14 sessions under these conditions, the orange solution was no longer delivered and ethanol solution alone was made available in the sessions. During both the conditioning and the ethanol self-administration portions of the experiment each monkey was required to drink an average of 0.5 g/kg ethanol per session in order to continue in the experiment. Of the nine monkeys exposed to these contingencies, five monkeys continued to self-administer ethanol after the presentation of the orange drink was discontinued. However, two of these five monkeys decreased their ethanol solution intake below 0.5 g/kg within 3 weeks after the conditioning sessions had terminated. The three monkeys that sustained high ethanol intake were male and had histories of drug self-administration, suggesting that gender and drug history may influence the initiation of ethanol self-administration. Once ethanol self-administration was established, concentrations of ethanol from 4 to 15% (v/v) were made available. The monkeys consumed intoxicating amounts of ethanol, as indicated by average intakes ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 g/kg and blood ethanol levels over 100 mg/dl. These results demonstrate that ethanol self-administration can be established and maintained through the initial reinforcement of ethanol consumption by the contingent presentation of another reinforcing stimulus. However, the results of this study also indicate that individual differences may be an important determinant of animals initiating ethanol self-administration.\r"

Stress resulted in (a) an increase in plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE, 243%), epinephrine (E, 175%), beta-endorphin (220%) and corticosterone (CS, 151%) and a decrease in dopamine (DA, 54%); (b) a decrease in hypothalamic NE (15%) and beta-endorphin (33%) levels and an increase E (23%) and DA (58%) levels; (c) a decrease in pituitary beta-endorphin levels in both the neurointermediate (23%) and anterior (131%) lobes. Treatment with ET resulted in: (a) an increase in plasma NE (81%), E (53%), CS (71%), and beta-endorphin (33%) levels and decrease in DA (54%); (b) a decrease in the hypothalamic NE (12%) levels and an increase DA (27%) and beta-endorphin (46%) levels, and (c) a decrease in beta-endorphin (15.5%) in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. Treatment with ET of stressed animals had only a small effect: (a) in plasma NE, E, CS, and beta-endorphin levels decreased by 30, 31, 14, and 36%, respectively; (b) in the hypothalamus DA levels decreased by 40% and beta-endorphin increased by 71%; (c) in the pituitary beta-endorphin increased in both the intermediate lobe (25%) and anterior (50%) lobes. Thus when the data of the stressed ET-treated group is compared to that of the nonstressed saline injected group, none of the measures differ significantly. These results confirm our earlier work indicating a significant interaction of ET and stress.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the oxidation of low molecular weight aliphatic alcohols by Class I, II, and III alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) isolated from human liver. These alcohols are generally present as byproducts of alcoholic beverages and referred to as alcoholic congeners. At concentrations corresponding to those in the blood after ingestion of alcoholic drinks (10-100 microM), the oxidation of propanol-1, isobutanol, 2-methylbutanol-1, and 3-methylbutanol-1 was mediated mainly by the isoenzymes of class I ADH, whereas butanol-1 was metabolized by Class I and II ADH. Class II ADH showed no activity with any of the alcohols at concentrations up to 100 microM. Lineweaver-Burk plots of the Class I ADH-catalyzed oxidation of all the congeners tested were linear in the pharmacokinetically relevant concentration range between 10 and 100 microM. Ethanol at concentrations found in the blood after moderate drinking (2.5-10 mM) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the congener oxidation. The experimentally determined kinetic constants were used to simulate the pharmacokinetics of propanol-1 metabolism in a multicompartment model system which accounts for first-pass elimination. The results suggest, in agreement with reported data from drinking experiments, that congener alcohols undergo considerable metabolism during the first liver passage, the extent of the first-pass metabolism depending on the ethanol dose.\r"

On one night, six asymptomatic nonalcoholic male snorers drank 2 ml/kg of 100 proof vodka mixed in orange juice (ethanol dose, 0.79 gm/kg, giving a peak blood alcohol level of 71.8 +/- 33.3 mg/dl). On a second night they received a placebo (1-2 drops of vodka floated on top of the orange juice). We measured (a) the minimum nasal (CPAP) required to eliminate snoring, (b) the number of hypopneas and apneas during each hour of sleep and (c) the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) by ear oximetry. On the alcohol night there was a significant increase in the CPAP pressure required to eliminate snoring (placebo 4.8 +/- 1.7 cm H2O, alcohol 6.2 +/- 1.5 cm H2O). The number of respiratory events per hour of sleep (apnea index) was 7.5 +/- 2.1 for ethanol nights versus 3.8 +/- 2.7 for placebo nights (p less than 0.0125). An apnea index of greater than 5 is generally considered abnormal. There was no significant difference in the number of desaturation events (declines of 4% or more in the SaO2) or in the mean SaO2, but the minimum SaO2 was significantly lower on the ethanol night (placebo 89.8% +/- 1.6, alcohol 86.8% +/- 2.7, p less than 0.05). The effect of this dose of alcohol on airway resistance was most pronounced during the first 2 hr after ingestion.\r"

No significant difference was found in erythrocyte activities of Cu-Zn-containing superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, or catalase between the groups. Of the 12 alcoholics with subnormal serum alpha-tocopherol, 50% had concomitant neurological clinical scores and cerebellar atrophy, and their neurological scores were significantly higher (82%) than for alcoholics with normal alpha-tocopherol levels (p less than 0.03). However, no significant correlation was observed between levels of alpha-tocopherol and neurological clinical scores or cerebellar atrophy. When entering the study, alcoholics and controls were each randomized into two separate groups, receiving vitamin E supplementation (100 mg/day) or placebo capsules for 10 days, respectively. In the four subgroups, alpha-tocopherol levels increased only in alcoholics receiving vitamin E supplementation (23%) (p less than 0.001). The reduced serum levels of alpha-tocopherol in alcoholics may be normalized by vitamin E supplementation.\r"

While 62% of the sample had either serum ethanol greater than 50 mg/dl or a positive urine analysis, only 42% of the sample reported being under the influence of some substance at the time of SCI. Although the relationship between these two measures was statistically significant, self-report and toxicology analyses were discordant in 34% of the cases. These results suggest that routine drug testing at admission to an SCI center will produce both false-negative and false-positive results if substance presence alone is interpreted as evidence of intoxication.\r"

Multiple regression was used to predict pregnancy outcome with PPAA and IPD, controlling for potentially confounding sociodemographic and health factors. PPAA predicted spontaneous abortion and lowered Apgar scores. The risk of spontaneous abortion increased an average of 25% for each additional ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per day (p less than 0.05). Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to intrauterine growth were more strongly related to IPD than PPAA, and IPD remained a significant predictor even after controlling for PPAA. The strongest association was with head circumference (p less than 0.01); logistic regression indicated that for each additional indication of problem drinking reported, risk of head circumference below the 10th percentile increased 2.77 times. Other pregnancy outcome measures negatively related to IPD were 5-min Apgar scores (p less than 0.05), birth weight (p less than 0.10), and 1-min Apgar scores (p less than 0.10). No significant curvilinear alcohol effects or interactions were observed.

All doses of ethanol were associated with a reduction in maternal weight gain, fetal body weight, and placental weight. Only the high dose of ethanol (total dose 18 g/kg) caused significant fetal cortical thinning. Acute exposure of pregnant rats to ethanol produced dose-dependent malformations of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in fetuses. On gestational Day 21, the 18 g/kg group contained fetuses with severely disorganized cortical architecture, heterotopias of the cerebral cortex, pia and choroid plexus, and status verrucosus deformis. Fetuses from the 10 g/kg group had less severe malformations, such as disorganization of layers of cortical neurons and dentate granule cells while fetuses from the 15 g/kg group had a mixture of severe and minor malformations. This study demonstrates that acute ethanol exposure during a critical period of development in rats can result in brain malformations similar to those reported in human fetuses and neonates from alcoholic mothers.\r"

It can be used alone as a rapid screening test in order to measure both cytotoxicity and the potential antiviral activity of large numbers of compounds. It can also be combined for thorough studies with other classic tests that detect virus production. Among these tests, a micro-method to measure reverse transcriptase activity is shown to be very useful. To illustrate the practicability of the assay, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and ribavirin are studied.\r"

The predominate loci are the cuspal commissures and basal attachments, in the porcine spongiosa layer, in cells and in collagen. Pericardial valves also tear frequently, most often near the top of the stent post. The status of understanding of bioprosthetic valve calcification and studies of preventive therapies were summarized. Data concerning retardation of mineralization by use of diphosphonate in controlled-released drug delivering polymers and pretreatment with aluminum salts were presented.\r"

  ".W": "Should AIDS patients be dialyzed? For asymptomatic HIV carriers and patients with ARC developing renal failure, dialysis is medically beneficial and may delay death from uremia for months or even years. In contrast, dialysis will not prevent a rapid death from AIDS, per se, and thus may be futile. While there may be competing interests regarding the survival of AIDS patients in renal failure versus risks to HCWs, current information does not support restricting the health care of AIDS patients on such grounds. Because AIDS patients are subject to prejudice and associated discriminatory practice and because recognition of the occasional patient with AIDS and renal failure who may survive for months on chronic hemodialysis is presently problematic, caution is necessary in determining and documenting medical futility. The principles of autonomy and beneficence are offered as equal moral principles by which professional behavior may be guided. Impaired competence is a special risk for AIDS patients. It is, therefore, recommended that effort be made to obtain advance directives regarding both instructions for future care and proxy designation. Caution is advised regarding the need to ascertain the authenticity of decisions rendered by sick or terminal patients and their proxies. The moral practice of medicine is a labor intensive process involving thorough knowledge of the patient as a person. Conflicting values must be negotiated in a manner that maximizes benefit according to the patient's own values, and medical care must be justly applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion. Should AIDS patients be dialyzed? Why not? The answer for each patient must be specific and individualized, defensible on moral grounds and well documented.\r"

Controls with and without parietal shields only absorbed 11% more urea and creatinine, 5-15% more glucose, and 7-12% more inulin, respectively, than eviscerated rats. The findings raise the possibility that the abdominal contents do not account for most of peritoneal transport.\r"

  ".W": "beta-2 Microglobulin levels (beta-2M) were analyzed at four month intervals in sera of 237 patients on various forms of dialysis over a 2 year period; twelve patients volunteered to participate in short-term kinetics studies. Duplicate beta-2M measurements in biologic fluids were performed using an RIA kit. The data presented confirm elevated serum beta-2M in dialyzed patients whatever the dialysis method used and give an overview on various factors affecting circulating serum beta-2M. Intraindividual beta-2M variations were 13% in stable ESRD patients. Unusually high values (greater than 2 SE) were observed in patients presenting with severe intercurrent disease (e.g., cancer). The only significant difference observed between groups of patients, HD (46 +/- 1 mg/L) and PD (IPD: 33 +/- 3, CAPD: 37 +/- 2 mg/L), was due to the residual renal function preserved in a higher percentage of PD patients. No significant difference was noted in HF (40 +/- 2 mg/L) and HDF (38 +/- 5 mg/L) patients, despite a higher beta-2M removal rate. beta-2M membrane permeability differs greatly among filters. It is high for AN69 and Polysulfone, intermediate for Polyamide, low for Polyacrylonitrile and none for Cuprophane. Peritoneal membrane is highly permeable to beta-2M with beta-2M dialysate/serum levels of 0.20 at the end of a 6 hr exchange. In conclusion, beta-2M determination in uremic patients is useful in assessing material permeability and biocompatibility. However, it is too early to determine the impact or the beneficial effects of using highly permeable membrane to prevent beta-2M-amyloidosis related nonarticular complications.\r"

Preliminary results with Swan Neck catheters, the catheters with a permanently bent intramural segment, are encouraging since these catheters are associated with low complication rates. The role of the external cuff in prevention of exit and tunnel infections is still controversial. Animal experiments indicate that collagen ingrowth into the external cuff is crucial in the inhibition of epidermal downgrowth. The author's recent preliminary observations on four catheter tunnels removed 1 month to 5.5 years after catheter implantations, indicate that 1) epidermal cells in humans do not spread deeper than a few millimeters from the skin exit and 2) the external cuff does not participate in the epidermal cell downgrowth inhibition. This is unlike animal studies. The difference in epidermal biology between humans and animals may render animal experiments difficult to apply to catheter technology in humans.\r"

The existence of this therapeutic modality has brought about major changes in the diagnosis, patient selection, treatment, and outlook for fulminant/subacute liver failure. The authors present the results of orthotopic liver transplantation for the treatment of 47 cases of acute/subacute hepatic insufficiency at the University of Pittsburgh between March 1980 and July 1987. The results of this series demonstrate that liver transplantation is the most effective means for treating this condition.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews the development of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and describes the design and dosimetry of an intermediate energy neutron beam, developed at the Harwell Laboratory, principally for BNCT research. Boron neutron capture therapy is a technique for the treatment of gliomas (a fatal form of brain tumour). The technique involves preferentially attaching 10B atoms to tumour cells and irradiating them with thermal neutrons. The thermal neutron capture products of 10B are short range and highly damaging, so they kill the tumour cells, but healthy tissue is relatively undamaged. Early trials required extensive neurosurgery to exposure the tumour to the thermal neutrons used and were unsuccessful. It is thought that intermediate-energy neutrons will overcome many of the problems encountered in the early trials, because they have greater penetration prior to thermalization, so that surgery will not be required. An intermediate-energy neutron beam has been developed at the Harwell Laboratory for research into BNCT. Neutrons from the core of a high-flux nuclear reactor are filtered with a combination of iron, aluminium and sulphur. Dosimetry measurements have been made to determine the neutron and gamma-ray characteristics of this beam, and to monitor them throughout the four cycles used for BNCT research. The beam is of high intensity (approximately 2 x 10(7) neutrons cm-2 s-1, equivalent to a neutron kerma rate in water of 205 mGy h-1) and nearly monoenergetic (93% of the neutrons have energies approximately 24 keV, corresponding to 79% of the neutron kerma rate).\r"

Acting as their own historical controls, their feelings about rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia and subsequent flexible cystoscopy under local anaesthesia were assessed: 6/53 (11%) preferred rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia. The only significant association with their dislike of flexible cystoscopy, was their desire to stay in hospital overnight. It was concluded that with careful counselling and attention to individual needs, the preference for flexible cystoscopy over rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia can approach 100%.\r"

All patients over 65 had radical radiotherapy. MTX was administered to 188 patients. There was no increase in toxicity attributable to the MTX. MTX did not significantly increase the proportion of patients whose tumours responded to radiotherapy; 50% (70/141) responded to radiotherapy and 56% (76/136) to MTX radiotherapy. The development of metastases and survival was also similar in both groups (3-year survival: radiotherapy 37.3%, MTX + radiotherapy 38.6%). We report the logistic difficulties of the administration of prolonged courses of maintenance chemotherapy. Further controlled trials of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in advanced bladder cancer are required, involving more active regimes.\r"

  ".W": "Pre-operative staging of rectal cancer might define patients with disease confined to the rectal wall without lymph node metastases, in whom local excision might be appropriate, or patients with extrarectal spread, who might benefit from pre-operative radiotherapy. With these objectives, 36 consecutive patients with rectal cancer were studied by endoluminal ultrasound: 17 of them also underwent computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis. The results were correlated with the findings at operation and subsequent pathological examination. Endoluminal ultrasound correctly predicted invasion of the tumour through the rectal wall in 86 per cent of patients, with a sensitivity of 96 per cent and specificity of 50 per cent, but correctly identified lymph node metastases in only 61 per cent of patients (sensitivity 57 per cent; specificity 64 per cent). CT correctly predicted invasion through the rectal wall in 94 per cent of cases, with a sensitivity of 100 per cent and specificity of 67 per cent and correctly identified lymph node metastases in 70 per cent of patients (sensitivity 25 per cent; specificity 85 per cent). These findings indicate that both endoluminal ultrasound and CT may be helpful in selecting patients for pre-operative radiotherapy. Neither technique, however, can reliably identify lymph node metastases and therefore cannot be used to select patients who would be suitable for local excision.\r"

Review of the literature over the last 25 years leads us to emphasize both the importance of adequate study size and of stratification of the severity of the sepsis found at operation. For critical comparison of prophylactic regimens the high percentage of wound infections disclosed after discharge from hospital must be taken into account. Antibiotics reduce the frequency of wound sepsis and although low wound sepsis rates have been reported with systemic antibiotics active against only anaerobes, the cumulative evidence favours a spectrum of antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Topical antiseptics have no significant effect but topical antibiotics are beneficial. Wide variations in outcome for similar antibiotic regimens reflect the importance of technical factors in determining the frequency of wound sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "From 1975 to 1987, 507 patients, of whom 63 (12.4 per cent) were over 55 years old at the time of operation, received first cadaver renal transplants. The annual percentage of recipients given transplants after the age of 55 has risen from 0 per cent in 1975 to 44 per cent in 1987. Of the 63 older patients, 41 had at least one serious non-renal disease at the time of transplantation. Perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. After successful transplantation these patients remained subject to a significant number of serious complications, even in the cyclosporin era. Despite these adverse factors, actuarial graft survival for the population over 55 years of age was no worse than for those patients receiving first cadaver grafts who were under 55 years old, although patient survival was poorer in the former group (P = 0.027). Analysis of the subgroup of 56 patients treated with an immunosuppression protocol containing cyclosporin failed to show any adverse effect of age on either graft or patient survival. It is concluded that renal transplantation can be as successful in patients over 55 years of age as it is in younger patients and, given an adequate supply of kidneys, should be considered the treatment of choice for the elderly patient with end-stage renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "The one advantage a physician has in designing a regimen to control glucose values in a patient with IDDM is that the physiologic mechanism underlying IDDM is homogeneous: All patients are deficient in insulin and tend to be responsive to physiologic amounts of exogenous insulin. Although patients with NIDDM are inherently more stable, the optimal therapy is less clear and physiologic abnormalities must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Maintaining a balance between food intake, exercise, emotions, hormonal changes, and insulin, however, is an ongoing challenge. Only a fraction of IDDM patients are able to achieve excellent control over a long period of time, but it is generally not possible to predict which patients will be able to achieve these goals. Physicians must be patient and persistent in helping patients adhere as closely as possible to a strict diabetic regimen. Psychological, social, and emotional factors must be considered at every visit. Concern over high glucose levels may cause physicians to overlook important emotional events or a family upset that is causing the patient to be less concerned about blood glucose values. If a patient is having trouble adhering to a regimen, the physician should do a complete history and physical examination, with an appropriate differential diagnosis to help address the broad scope of the problem. For most diabetic persons who administer insulin, split, mixed doses given several times throughout the day allow the patient to use a lower total dose and minimize risk of hypoglycemia while improving the potential for glucose control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sensitive TSH assays have important applications in various conditions, including the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, monitoring thyroid hormone therapy and treated thyrotoxic patients, and evaluating thyroid dysfunction in nonthyroidal illnesses and pregnancy. Interpretation of the TSH value should be made with a clear understanding of its limitations. TSH may be inappropriately secreted by pituitary tumors and by pituitary dysfunction due to thyroxine resistance. At present, it is uncertain whether clinically euthyroid patients with autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, or with multinodular goiters, or patients taking thyroid hormone who have suppressed TSH values, are actually euthyroid at a cellular level. Other factors that affect TSH levels are the biologic variation in its secretion, the presence of heterophilic antibodies in a patient's serum, and various drugs. But perhaps the most important factor affecting the TSH assay is severe nonthyroidal illness in hospitalized patients. The new ultrasensitive TSH assay does not yet replace other thyroid function tests, but it is clearly emerging as an important means of screening patients for thyroid dysfunction, especially ambulatory patients without other serious illnesses. It can usually separate patients with thyroid dysfunction from euthyroid individuals. Good clinical assessment is always necessary, and other thyroid function tests are often needed. The sensitivity of these new TSH assays in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism is excellent; the specificity is not as good. Nonetheless, at present this test can be used in the initial diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction as outlined in Figure 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A variety of effective pharmacologic, surgical and electrical therapies for VT are now available to the clinician. Patients who present with ventricular tachyarrhythmias should undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation directed at identifying and treating such factors as ischemia, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, sensitivity to cardioactive drugs, and metabolic derangements. Many patients who present with asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias do not require specific antiarrhythmic drug therapy. However, certain patients who have already suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia or who are at high risk for such arrhythmia should be vigorously treated with specific antiarrhythmic therapy guided for that individual patient. The efficacy of any antiarrhythmic treatment should be assessed by ECG monitoring, exercise testing, and/or electrophysiologic study. In the near future, potentially revolutionary new electrical therapies for ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be evaluated. It is to be hoped that these devices used in combination with pharmacologic and surgical therapies may dramatically reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients.\r"

The 7 days of exercise did not result in significant changes in body weight or maximal oxygen uptake. Plasma glucose concentration at 120 min averaged 227 +/- 23 mg/dl in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and 170 +/- 18 mg/dl after the 7 days of exercise (P less than .001). There was a 36% reduction in the area under the glucose tolerance curve. Plasma insulin concentration at 120 min of the OGTT averaged 172 +/- 27 microU/ml before and 106 +/- 13 microU/ml after 7 days of exercise (P less than .001); the area under the insulin curve was decreased by 32%. In contrast to the response to 7 days of exercise, one bout of exercise did not result in an improvement in glucose tolerance. These results provide evidence that regularly performed, vigorous exercise can be effective in decreasing insulin resistance and improving glucose tolerance within 7 days in some patients with mild NIDDM.\r"

The plasma glucagon responses of the 61 children without glucagon antibodies or abnormal glucagon molecules were compared with those of 13 nondiabetic control subjects, aged 8.3-18.3 yr. Glucagon increments from baseline (73 +/- 10 pg/ml) and peak glucagon responses (212 +/- 13 pg/ml) were markedly lower in diabetic patients than in control subjects (341 +/- 49 and 462 +/- 51 pg/ml, respectively, P less than .001). Glucagon responses were found to correlate positively with the age of the patients at the time of testing (r = .478, P less than .001) and inversely with metabolic control as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (r = -.342, P less than .02). There was no relationship between glucagon responses and diabetes duration. There was also no relationship between the glucagon increments and free-insulin levels during the test. Glucose recovery from the nadir was impaired in diabetic subjects compared with control subjects and correlated inversely with free-insulin levels. However, glucose recovery did not correlate with the rise of plasma glucagon. Glucose recovery was not different in patients with glucagon antibodies. In this study, we have demonstrated a deficient glucagon response to hypoglycemia in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, the clinical significance of this deficit is not clear.\r"

Insulin absorption was measured as elimination of radioactivity (external gamma-counting) and as appearance of plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI). The glucose-clamp technique was used to maintain normoglycemia. Identical measurements were performed during a control day without CWT. HR and mean BP increased markedly (35 +/- 5 beats/min and 30 +/- 3 mmHg) during CWT despite only minor elevations in plasma catecholamines. Thus, arterial plasma Epi rose from 0.18 +/- 0.03 to 0.82 +/- 0.17 nM (P less than .01) and NE from 0.94 +/- 0.09 to 1.69 +/- 0.18 nM (P less than .001). ATBF showed a biphasic response, with a 100% elevation during CWT followed by a decrease and a second peak of similar magnitude approximately 0.5 to 1 h after CWT. Blood glycerol was approximately doubled during CWT and remained elevated during recovery. Despite these changes, insulin absorption was unaltered during and after stress. Thus, elimination rates of 125I, plasma IRI levels, and amounts of glucose needed to maintain normoglycemia were all similar during the stress and control days. These results suggest that absorption of soluble insulin from subcutaneous injection sites in the thigh is unaltered during potent mental stress in healthy subjects despite a considerable and prolonged increase in ATBF.\r"

While the choice of the method of dilatation depends on the individual patient's needs and operator experience, bougie dilatation is more effective in reducing dysphagia and maintaining stricture patency.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of antacid maintenance therapy in preventing duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse was investigated. Two hundred and fifty one asymptomatic patients with healed DU were stratified into smokers and non-smokers and randomised to receive for one year either placebo, or Maalox TC three tablets (81 mmol) at bedtime (hs), or Maalox TC three tablets in the morning plus three tablets at bedtime (bd) (162 mmol), or cimetidine 400 mg at bedtime. A double dummy technique was used to render the study double blind. In 176 patients evaluable for efficacy, the cumulative relapse at one year was: placebo 57%; Maalox TC hs 39%; Maalox TC bd 23%; cimetidine 25%. Maalox TC bd and cimetidine were equally effective and superior to placebo (p less than 0.01) and bedtime Maalox TC (p less than 0.04). The benefit of treatment was significant for the overall sample and for the subgroup of smokers. The results for the non-smokers also supported efficacy for these two treatments but, perhaps because of small sample sizes, these comparisons were not significant. All 251 patients were assessed for safety. Approximately half the patients in each treatment group had adverse events, leading to withdrawal in three, seven, 12, and four patients on placebo, Maalox hs, Maalox bd, and cimetidine respectively. Diarrhoea occurred in 12 patients in Maalox TC bd and eight in each other group. Serum magnesium concentrations were unchanged; aluminium concentrations were higher than baseline at six and 12 months in both antacid groups and at 12 months in the cimetidine group but the differences were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A murine split-thickness skin graft model was developed to investigate the role of a large surface area wound in the initiation of immunosuppression in the absence of burn injury. Significant T cell-mediated immunosuppression was demonstrated following wounding and immediate repair with either syngeneic or allogeneic split-thickness skin grafts. These results are consistent with previous experiments in a murine burn model treated by escharectomy and resurfacing with syngeneic composite full-thickness skin. Data also supports the concept that mediators of inflammation at the wound site play an important role in postburn immunosuppression. Furthermore, these results suggest that the use of skin allografts during the early postburn period does not adversely affect cell-mediated immunity in any way that could be abrogated by primary autografting.\r"

Of patients excised and grafted, the mean graft take for a total of 100 procedures was 86%. Rash occurred in 18% of patients and sulfamylon was discontinued with no sequelae. Twenty-five percent had at least one positive fungal wound culture, yet only 3% required treatment for candidemia. Those patients who developed a rash and fungal colonization had a significantly larger percent burn and were treated with sulfamylon for a longer period of time. Pain intensity was rated on a Visual Analog Scale with a mean score of 2.4; in no case was the pain considered severe enough by the patient to terminate treatment. Acidosis was present in 3% of patients but felt to be unrelated to the sulfamylon treatment. As an antimicrobial agent, 5% sulfamylon solution is a viable alternative for fresh autografts with excellent graft take and acceptable side effects.\r"

Along with the use of this technique, however, comes the potential for significant blood loss, prolonged operative time, and partial loss of graft due to underlying hematoma formation. Based on experience using a pooled fibrinogen preparation, European and Japanese surgeons have provided evidence for the positive hemostatic and skin transplant fixation effects of fibrin glue. This commercial preparation, however, has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States because of high risk of hepatitis and HIV transmission. Using a method of preparing highly concentrated fibrinogen utilizing standard blood bank techniques developed at the University of Virginia, we have applied single-donor fibrin glue as an adjunct in the early excision and grafting of 26 patients. Since we have been using fibrin glue, we have noted a marked reduction in operative blood loss and time involved in obtaining hemostasis. Additionally, we have found the application of the grafts to be facilitated by the \"stickiness\" of the recipient bed. In follow-up, grafts applied utilizing the fibrin glue technique have proceeded to uncomplicated wound healing with an overall 98% graft take.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of large burns would be simplified by the development of a nonsensitizing allograft which would survive permanently. In our hands, in vitro immune modification of the allograft has prolonged graft survival in mice across major histocompatibility barriers (H-2d to H-2b) by 36% (steroid pretreatment) and 25% (monoclonal antibody to the Iad antigen found on donor Langerhans cells). To our knowledge, monoclonal antibody has not been employed in this capacity previously. Double grafting studies suggest that neither MK-D6 nor steroids enhance graft survival by systemic immunosuppression. Moreover, MK-D6 acts upon the afferent limb of the immune response while steroids interrupt the efferent limb (and probably afferent limb). These effects are not additive. This modest improvement in allograft survival may have profound importance since allografts supported briefly by host immunosuppression have gone on to indefinite survival in burn victims without further immunologic intervention. This improvement in allograft survival is of fundamental immunologic interest. If synergistic pretreatments can be found, it may ultimately allow allografting of burn victims with the expectation of indefinite graft survival.\r"

  ".U": "89123604\r", 
  ".W": "The technique of transplantation of autologous microskin grafts (MG) with overlays of split-thickness skin allografts was used in the treatment of nine extensively burned patients. Preparation of MG includes: 1) mincing small pieces of split-thickness skin autografts into skin particles (SPs); 2) dispersing the SPs evenly on a piece of silk cloth; 3) transferring SPs to the dermal surface of an allograft sheet (20/1000 in.); 4) transplanting the allograft with SPs to the excised wound. The mean burn area (total/3 degrees, mean +/- SEM) of this group was 74.9 +/- 16.6/62.1 +/- 18.1% TBSA (range 40 to 94/28 to 90%). The mean age was 27 years (range 19 to 38). Early staged excisions followed immediately by MG applications were performed on 35 large body sites, including extremities, chests plus abdomens and backs. The mean area excised and grafted with MG was 41.7 +/- 11.0% TBSA (range 26 to 62%). The average time for complete healing was about six to seven weeks postgrafting. Eight patients survived; one died of overwhelming pulmonary infection 22 days postburn. Advantages of this technique are: 1) the great potential of MG to provide a large expansion ratio of 8:1 to 15:1, average greater than 10:1 in this series; 2) good maintenance of the healed graft to withstand trauma except in areas of repeated flexion; 3) ease of preparation and application with less cost compared to cultured epidermal sheet grafts; 4) prevention of infection in extremely large burns by providing continuous epidermal coverage following sheet allograft application.\r"

This study compared the storage viability of nonmeshed v meshed skin stored at 4 degrees C in nutrient medium. Skin specimens from six human donors were stored for up to 35 days in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium at 4 degrees C. Skin specimens (1 cm in diameter) were transplanted to surgically created defects on the thorax of nude mice at fixed intervals during the storage period. Gross and microscopic techniques were used to determine the graft viability at 10 days postgraft. Skin was divided into two storage groups as nonmeshed or meshed 1.5/1. The storage configuration was free-floating, 10 cm x 2 cm sheet grafts. The ratio of skin surface area to volume medium was 300 cm2/100 mL. There was no significant difference between the viability of the nonmeshed group compared to the meshed group. Prior meshing of human allograft does not adversely affect the viability of banked skin. Therefore, skin can be stored in a meshed configuration. This eliminates operating room time spent preparing allograft for application, which is cost-effective.\r"

Of 19 males admitted to our facilities with burns greater than 80% TBSA, eight had the scrotum spared injury. The remaining 11 patients served as a control population to study the efficacy of scrotal donor harvests. The scrotal skin was expanded using the Pitkin syringe and harvested at a depth of 5/1000 to 8/1000 in, with a mean yield of 73 +/- 8 sq cm. Expanded 4:1, this tissue covered an area of 280 +/- 33 sq cm. The scrotum was harvested 2 +/- 0.4 times, compared to 4 +/- 1 harvests of the other donor group. There were no statistical differences in the number of surgical procedures or the length of hospitalization between the two groups. The scrotal donor sites healed within the same length of time as other donor sites and were harvestable as frequently. Due to the natural expandability of scrotal skin, a large surface area of usable donor site is available and their harvest may be lifesaving in male patients with large TBSA burns.\r"

  ".W": "The period for which oocyte-derived factors are engaged in the control of human embryonic development involves at least the first four cell cycles after fertilization. The maternal-embryonic transition in humans 8- to 16-cell embryos is a relatively vulnerable process, the failure of which entails developmental arrest of the given blastomere. The very early cellular differentiative events in human embryos, including blastomere surface polarization and segregation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm cell lineages, appear to be dependent largely on the maternal genetic program. However, the embryonic genome is required for the formation of the blastocyst cavity, which is necessary to allow further differentiation of the first two embryonic tissues. Blastomeres with major developmental defects are removed by fragmentation and their loss is compensated by proliferation of remaining normal blastomeres. This mechanism is also mainly responsible for the regulation of ploidy through elimination of aneuploid blastomeres. The data presented suggest that embryos of individual mammalian species may differ in the timing of relevant developmental changes at the cellular and molecular levels. This should be taken into account when findings obtained on embryos of one species are used to anticipate the behavior of embryos of another species under identical conditions.\r"

In the present study, muscle cultures from different patients were used to investigate the cause of clinical heterogeneity and the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy. The activity of acid alpha-glucosidase appears to be the primary factor in determining the extent of lysosomal glycogen storage in muscle, and thereby the clinical severity of the disease. Neutral alpha-glucosidases do not seem influential. Correction of the enzymatic defect was achieved in skeletal muscle cultures from patients by administration of a \"high-uptake\" form of acid alpha-glucosidase, purified from human urine. The enzyme reaches the lysosomes, including the glycogen storage vacuoles, and the lysosomal glycogen content is reduced to control level. In normal muscle cells 20% of the total cellular glycogen pool is segregated in lysosomal compartments. This percentage is higher than in fibroblasts, which may partly explain why muscles are more prone to store glycogen. The relevance of this study for enzyme therapy is discussed.\r"

Reverse transcriptase assays indicated virus concentrations in the range of 10(8) particles/ml of semen, an accumulation substantiated by electron microscopic visualization of cell-free virus. This is the first description of cell-free retrovirus in seminal fluid and at a greater concentration than reported for blood or other body fluids or tissues. These results suggest that the male reproductive tract of humans may be a reservoir of HIV expression, and raises the possibility that the cells lining the epididymal lumen could be chronically infected with HIV. These are important considerations in formulating treatment and preventive strategies.\r"

In order to explore the role of sperm in this transmission, cell-free HIV-1(IIIB) was coincubated with human sperm for 5 h. After incubation, unattached HIV-1 was extensively washed off the cells and the presence and location of HIV-1 in or on the sperm was determined by electron microscopic (EM) and immunofluorescence methods. Examination of sperm at the EM level showed that HIV-1 attaches to the sperm surface and enters the sperm through the intact cell membrane. Immunofluorescence studies, using polyvalent anti-HIV antibodies, demonstrated the presence of small round fluorescent particles in 5-10% of sperm heads after 5 h of incubation. A search for HIV-1 receptors (CD4 epitopes) revealed the presence of OKT4 epitopes, including OKT4A, B, D, and F on 5-10% of sperm by epifluorescence microscopy and on 10-20% of sperm by flow-cytometric analysis. These in vitro data suggest that human sperm may be the primary cellular element in the transmission of HIV by semen.\r"

The most common immediate cause of death was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, seen in one-third of cases. Autopsy findings modified the clinical impression of the cause of death in 55% of cases. The most common diagnostic disease entity in all organ sites was cytomegalovirus. The total clinical course of AIDS from diagnosis to death averaged 7 months, while the mean terminal hospital course was 20 days, and these courses did not vary substantially over the period of the study.

We included the cost of azidothymidine (AZT) therapy, as well as other therapeutic innovations likely to be approved by the FDA, and estimated average ARC patient treatment costs. By combining prospective study data on rates of progression to AIDS with current AIDS incidence data, we arrived at human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence and AIDS incidence projection that were considerably lower than those of the Public Health Service. We estimated the average total medical costs per patient for AIDS in the 1990s at $27,950-$40,455 and for ARC at $3,621-$4,913 per year (1987 U.S. dollars). We projected the medical costs of AIDS and ARC at $2-4 billion annually by 1991, substantially lower than previous estimates. We projected that Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and other pulmonary complications would account for the largest share (over 40%) of AIDS medical costs, and that AZT therapy and medication would account for more than 25% of total ARC/AIDS treatment costs by 1991. In our estimates, the total medical costs of treating ARC patients could approach one-half of the costs of treating AIDS patients by 1991, primarily due to costs associated with AZT.\r"

Skeletal muscle has been found to be relatively insulin-resistant in myotonic dystrophy, and a decrease in the anabolic action of insulin on skeletal muscle may be related to muscle wasting in this disorder. Laboratory studies, including electromyography, electrocardiography, and muscle biopsy, are helpful in evaluating patients for this disorder, but the clinical aspects and a careful family history remain the mainstays of diagnosis. A number of management strategies preserve function and prevent complications in myotonic dystrophy.\r"

The inflammatory myopathies generally produce predominantly proximal, symmetric muscle weakness and wasting. Additional criteria for diagnosis include elevated serum muscle enzymes, myopathic features on EMG, and muscle biopsy abnormalities, including muscle fiber necrosis, degeneration, and inflammatory infiltrates. Inclusion body myositis is distinctive in that distal weakness is most commonly equal to or greater than proximal weakness and muscle biopsy reveals rimmed, cytoplasmic vacuoles, eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm, and nucleus and abnormal filamentous structures. Autoimmune mechanisms seem likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders and viral infection may be etiologically involved in some of these diseases. The differences in the site of immune-mediated damages suggest an angiography in dermatomyositis while direct muscle fiber involvement is more likely in polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. Therapy of these disorders is similar although some, particularly inclusion body myositis, may be particularly resistant to therapy. Prednisone is currently recommended as the first treatment with azathioprine or methotrexate added after 3 months if steroids are ineffective.\r"

Steroid myopathy and the myopathy associated with excess ACTH have a typical pattern of proximal weakness affecting the legs more than the arms. Steroid myopathy is usually not apparent until other signs of glucocorticoid excess are present. Treatments of steroid myopathy are as follows: Lower the dose of steroid, use a nonfluorinated glucocorticoid, and exercise or physical therapy. Adrenal insufficiency produces generalized weakness, muscle cramping, and fatigue in 50 per cent of patients. Some patients also develop hyperkalemic paralysis. The treatment is hormone replacement. Thyrotoxicosis produces myopathy caused by net protein catabolism, accelerated basal metabolic rate and impaired carbohydrate metabolism. Shortening of contraction time may result from accelerated myosin ATPase activity and enhanced calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Depolarization of the muscle fiber and impaired Na-K activity in muscle may predispose to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Neuromuscular presynaptic impairment may account for the worsening of myasthenia gravis by thyrotoxicosis. In hypothyroidism, impaired energy metabolism may limit force generation. Slow contraction and relaxation reflect reduction in myosin ATPase activity and impaired calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Treatment for thyroid-associated muscle disorders is restoration of a euthyroid state. Muscle weakness associated with hypopituitarism is due to loss of thyroid and adrenal cortical hormones. Children require growth hormone for muscle development. T3 and growth hormone synergize to maintain normal protein synthesis. Primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia are often associated with proximal weakness and fatigability. The myopathy improves with restoration of normal PTH levels and vitamin D replacement. Hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypothyroidism are associated with tetany. Tetany is worsened by alkalosis and is treated by calcium and magnesium replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four adults (10 male; age 27-65 years, median 43.5) with hepatic haemangioma are reviewed. Fifteen had right hypochondrial pain (lesions 8 cm or more in diameter in nine). Six lesions were found incidentally, at ultrasound examination or elective cholecystectomy. Diagnosis, from ultrasonic and angiographic appearances, was confirmed in 12 by percutaneous biopsy without complication. Eleven patients were followed untreated for up to 60 months (median 24 months): lesion size (median 2.5 cm) did not change and all remained well. Surgical resection succeeded in two of three patients; the third and eight other patients (seven with symptoms) with lesions 3 to 30 cm in diameter were selected for Gelfoam embolization. Transient minor side effects preceded improvement in most, but two patients (with lesions of 20 cm or greater in diameter) developed multiple liver abscesses: recovery was protracted. Embolization failed in three; two remain well, untreated, to 24 and 51 months. Two patients had hepatic artery ligation, one with radiotherapy. Further imaging at from eight to 60 months (median 24) showed little change in lesion size or vascularity with any non-resectional technique. Expectant management of small asymptomatic haemangiomas appears appropriate. Embolization may reduce pain but the risk of abscess formation is high for large tumours, and reduction in size or vascularity of lesions is unlikely whatever their initial diameter.\r"

The methacholine challenge test using dosimeter nebulisation with controlled tidal breathing was compared with continuous nebulisation using De Vilbiss No 40 nebulisers with deep inhalations in 11 asthmatic subjects. Within subject PD20 FEV1 values were lower with the dosimeter method than with the continuous nebulisation method (geometric means 158 and 588 micrograms). The repeatability of the dosimeter method with controlled tidal breathing was studied in 11 asthmatic subjects, and the 95% range for a single measurement was +/- 0.72 doubling doses of methacholine. The dosimeter method has greater efficacy because aerosol is delivered during the first part of an inhalation, minimising loss of aerosol outside the respiratory tract. The dosimeter technique combined with controlled tidal breathing appears to be a useful method for carrying out standardised non-specific bronchoprovocation tests.\r"

Among the nine patients available for follow up, pulmonary nocardiosis was considered to be the major clinical problem in six. The patients usually presented with a chronic pulmonary infection with fever and cough without evidence of dissemination of underlying systemic disease. The chest radiograph showed consolidation in any part of the lung, and this was seen to extend slowly over several months. Prolonged diagnostic delay was a frequent problem. Haemoptysis, alcohol abuse, and empirical treatment for tuberculosis commonly featured in the history. Treatment with sulphonamides was generally successful in those patients who complied. Nocardiosis is a treatable lung disease that may be more common in developing countries than is currently recognised.\r"

There was a trend towards a greater response to a bronchodilator after budesonide. The results suggest that inhaled corticosteroids reduce hyperinflation in young asthmatic children.\r"

In two patients the artery was angiographically normal, in one it was irregular in outline, and three had focal segments with significant stenosis. None of the patients had concentrations of plasma lipids above 5.5 mmol/l. The endothelial surface showed widespread focal abnormalities ranging from adhesion and migration of monocytes to loss of individual endothelial cells. Larger areas of endothelial denudation with exposure of underlying collagen were also seen consistently. Loss of endothelial cells was associated with accumulation of monocytes, on and deep to the surface, as well as adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelial tissue. These results accord with the endothelial damage and platelet adhesion seen in hyperlipidaemic animals fed a high lipid diet.\r"

At the time of exercise 62 patients were taking a beta blocker. The exercise test had a higher sensitivity in predicting multivessel disease in patients who were not taking beta blockers than in patients who were (95% v 76%). beta Blockade did not, however, influence the ability of the test to identify patients at risk of subsequent cardiac events (sensitivity 84% and 85% respectively). These results suggest that it is not necessary to stop treatment with beta blockers before predischarge exercise testing of patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The warfarin (n = 56) and the control (n = 54) groups were not different in terms of age, sex, previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary balloon angioplasty, severity of symptoms, and frequency of multivessel disease or of total coronary occlusions. Warfarin was started on the day of the procedure and the dosage was adjusted to maintain the thromboplastin international normalised ratio greater than or equal to 2.5. One hundred and five (96%) of the patients were given verapamil and other antianginal drugs were prescribed as needed. Low molecular weight dextran and heparin were given during the procedure and heparin was continued for 24 hours in all patients. One hundred and eight (98%) of patients were followed up clinically after a median of five months (range 1-20). Eighty five (77%) had follow up angiography at five months. In the warfarin group symptoms improved in 46 (85%) patients by at least 1 angina class and 31 (57%) were symptom free; the exercise test remained positive in 20 (36%) patients and the angiographic restenosis rate was 25% per lesion and 29% per patient. There were no major bleeding complications. In the control group 46 (85%) patients were improved by at least 1 angina class and 31 (57%) were symptom free; the exercise test was positive in 11 (21%) patients and the angiographic restenosis rate was 33% per lesion and 37% per patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At each examination the signals obtained from vessels supplying the ovaries were recorded and quantified using a resistance index (RI). Fifteen patients became pregnant of whom one has subsequently miscarried. There was a highly significant difference in the RI values between patients who became pregnant and those who did not; no patient who became pregnant had a RI greater than 0.5. Oestrogen to progesterone ratios were calculated in the subgroup of non-pregnant patients and there was no correlation between these values and the RI values. This new technique enables prediction of IVF treatment failure earlier than has been reported previously and may reflect the inadequacy of the corpus luteum.\r"

Twenty women, studied while normotensive during mid-pregnancy, developed pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in the third trimester. There was slightly greater difficulty adapting to sodium depletion (LS diet) during normal pregnancy compared with postpartum. The final mean values for sodium excretion were 27 (SE 2), 28 (SE 3) and 14 (SE 4) mmol/day in the second and third trimester and postpartum respectively. Sodium excretion with the HS diet was similar at all stages and plasma volumes were maintained as effectively during pregnancy as after delivery following both diets. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration rose and fell significantly following the LS and HS diets but the sensitivity of renin response to changes in salt intake was blunted during normal pregnancy. Women who later developed PIH, when studied whilst normotensive, failed to stimulate plasma aldosterone after salt depletion in their second trimester and did not exhibit the 'sodium-independent' component of PRA seen in continuously normotensive subjects at this stage.\r"

Histological examination confirmed an ectopic pregnancy in 60 women (24%); in seven a live fetus was observed outside the uterus allowing a confident diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy; in 27 the thickness of the endometrium was greater than 10 mm (sensitivity 50%, specificity 84%, positive predictive value 28%, negative predictive value 87%); in 15 the uterine area measurement was less than 20 cm2 (sensitivity 72%, specificity 41%, positive predictive value 20%, negative predictive value 79%); and 43 had an adnexal mass volume greater than 10 ml separate from the ovary (sensitivity 85%, specificity 37%, positive predictive value 23%, negative predictive value 90%). Only three had negative ultrasound findings. The negative predictive value of an ultrasound examination could be increased to 96% by using a combination of these ultrasound features. The addition of hCG (greater than 25 i.u./l) improved the specificity to 98% and the negative predictive value to 100%. These criteria may improve the ultrasound diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

In the maternal carotid artery, time average mean velocity (TAVmean) did not show significant changes. In both the femoral artery and vein, however, significant changes were observed. In the femoral artery, TAVmean and systolic maximum velocities decreased with advancing gestation. In the femoral vein, TAVmean remained constant throughout pregnancy and was lower than postpartum. The resistance index in the uterine arteries decreased with advancing gestation and increased after delivery. Among many factors contributing to femoral arterial blood flow velocity changes in pregnancy, we suggest that a major one is the increase in uterine blood flow. Reduction in venous femoral blood flow velocity and increase in the femoral vein diameter might be associated with the common occurrence of venous disorders in pregnancy.\r"

Living skin equivalents, composed of a dermal equivalent (fibroblasts plus collagen) covered by epithelial cells were grafted, meshed or non-meshed, onto granulation tissue and, in one patient, onto fascia. Eight patients with full skin thickness burn wounds covering over 15 per cent of the body surface area were thus partially covered. The graft 'take' was evaluated every 48 h. In every patient grafted, an extensive lysis (60-90 per cent) of the skin equivalent graft was observed at the first dressing (48 h). In one patient only, a significant percentage of 'take' (40 per cent) was observed 14 days after grafting. These disappointing results were probably related to the presence of collagenases or proteases produced on the wound bed either by bacteria or by surrounding human cells. It appears that at the present time the biochemical nature of the dermal equivalent used is not yet completely appropriate to serve routinely as a substitute for human skin.\r"

Although conquest of preterm births may yet be a distant goal that will require substantial improvements in understanding the pathophysiology of PTD, interim progress is possible. Increased attention to prematurity prevention as the focus of prenatal care can have an impact now, without introducing unproven or hazardous techniques or medication. Reproductive health care aimed at the prevention and elimination of social, demographic, and medical correlates of prematurity can yield results if obstetricians take the lead in educating both patients and society at large about the hazards of prematurity. Progress is more likely if a global strategy is used in all pregnancies as reported by Papiernik et al., Meis et al., and Herron et al. These studies have similar messages of hope and caution: All reported benefit in decreasing the frequency of preterm births, all required substantial and widespread patient and provider education, and all required a sustained effort before any effect was noted. Main et al. showed that these programs are not likely to produce a quick turnaround in PTD rates in all populations; progress will be slow. Reports of limited success or even failure should not result in abandonment of the goal, but rather in renewed and imaginative efforts toward it.\r"

  ".W": "The transition from fetal to newborn to adult previously has been associated with a progressive increase in myocardial contractile function. The purpose of this review is to summarize new information on the biochemical and molecular processes that regulate the perinatal maturation of heart function. The developing heart experiences a perinatal increase in the cellular quantity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the myofibrils, the organelles that regulate and utilize cytosolic calcium to produce cardiac contraction. It also has become evident that the function of the available ion pump proteins is reduced in fetuses and newborns compared to adults of the same species. The resultant limited regulation of cytosolic calcium concentrations by the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhances the role of the sarcolemma in this process. Although it appears that the perinatal maturation of sarcoplasmic reticular function is not under direct molecular regulation, alternative splicing may regulate its gene products. A great deal of the perinatal maturation of myofibrillar protein function appears to be regulated by molecular processes. This has been best demonstrated in detail for myosin. In some species, such as the rat, much of the perinatal increase in myocardial contractile function can be explained by a parallel change in myosin isoforms. This isoform shift alters the activity of its ion pump, thereby allowing it to utilize more calcium. In contrast, the perinatal maturation of contractile function in several larger species cannot be explained fully by the extent of the molecular changes that have been identified currently in these species.\r"

The magnitude of benefit depends on the preexisting hemodynamic state and concurrent treatment modalities. In patients with increased filling pressures, vasodilators increase cardiac output with negligible effect on MAP, with volume resuscitation to restore pretreatment filling pressures offering additional benefit. The rationale for use in neonatal respiratory disease remains less clear, with no vasoactive drug showing selective pulmonary vasodilatation. Benefit no doubt accrues from the improved coronary perfusion that occurs with reduction in filling pressures. In addition, reduced interventricular diastolic dependence and thereby improved ventricular compliance, as well as the afterload-reducing effect of decreased chamber size, may significantly reduce the effect of the lung disease on myocardial functioning.\r"

  ".U": "89136408\r", 
  ".W": "Most pharmacokinetic and biologic attributes of digitalis are age dependent. They are determined in great measure by the chemical structure of the specific cardiac glycoside being used. These effects differ in the intact normal circulation and in heart failure because of the altered autonomic nervous system and hormonal control that exist in the latter. Digitalis is effective only in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, but in a clinical setting, cardiac performance may be difficult to gauge; improved tools are needed for this purpose. The dosages of digoxin recommended for infants and children have been steadily reduced in the past decade, and there is no good evidence that more favorable risk-to-benefit ratios are achieved when higher doses are used or when higher plasma concentrations are sought. Massive digitalis toxicity is a serious, often fatal, complication in young infants, especially when the drug is given parenterally; it may be difficult to diagnose early. The only reliable deterrent for this complication is the adoption of careful safety standards whenever the drug is employed. Experience with digoxin antibodies is still scarce in children, especially in infancy, but their use generally has been associated with a favorable outcome. Endogenous substances that interfere with the digoxin radioimmunoassay (DLIS) occasionally yield clinically relevant, erroneously high, plasma digoxin concentration readings in neonates. An interesting hypothesis currently being investigated is the physiologic and pathologic role of these compounds in sodium hemostasis; they may be part of a putative endogenous NaK-ATP-ase inhibitor involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal diseases.\r"

We currently dilate neonates and infants with critical valvular pulmonary and aortic stenosis and postoperative aortic obstruction. We do not routinely dilate native coarctation of the aorta because of the possibility of aneurysm formation, unless the neonate is very sick and acidotic and an operative approach is considered to be high risk. Balloon and blade atrial septostomy are done routinely whenever indicated with a low incidence of morbidity. Coil embolization, endomyocardial biopsy, foreign body retrieval and percutaneous pericardial drainage are relatively safe, and with the currently available instruments these techniques can be performed safely in neonates and infants with the same indications as for older patients. We currently consider stenotic pulmonary veins to be an undilatable lesion and an optimal therapy remains to be defined. Transcatheter closure of PDA and intracardiac shunts is presently limited to older patients, due to the large size of the delivery system devices and cannot currently be used in neonates. Dilation of the pulmonary valve in cyanotic congenital heart disease appears useful, but further experience is needed.\r"

  ".W": "Closed heart surgery in congenital heart disease can be palliative or corrective. Palliative surgery aims at improving the physiologic deficit rather than the anatomic defect of the heart. Palliative procedures aim to increase pulmonary blood flow in cyanotic children with decreased pulmonary blood flow (Blalock-Taussig shunt), decrease pulmonary blood flow when there is unrestricted flow (pulmonary artery banding), or improve venous mixing in cyanotic children that require pulmonary and systemic venous mixing for survival (atrial septectomy). The indications for palliation over corrective surgery have changed over time. Now we reserve palliation for children that require low pulmonary vascular resistance for correction, a conduit that will require replacement as the child grows, or where the risk of the corrective procedure decreases rapidly with age. For palliation with systemic to pulmonary artery shunts, we prefer to perform a Blalock-Taussig subclavian to pulmonary artery shunt using a synthetic (PTFE) tube graft in infants. The operative mortality is higher in infants under 1 month of age but is not affected by weight or diagnosis. Palliative surgery to decrease pulmonary blood flow is restricted primarily to infants with large left-to-right shunts where the risk of correction in infancy is high (multiple VSDs) or not feasible (univentricular heart). The operative risk for pulmonary artery banding is affected mostly by the complexity of the cardiac defect and the clinical state of the infant (severe congestive failure) at the time of surgery. A trial septectomy to improve venous mixing is used mostly in infants with univentricular heart in whom a balloon septostomy was ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Epileptic syndromes are clusters of signs and symptoms regularly occurring together. These may include type of seizure(s), time and circumstances of occurrence, and neurological and EEG findings. Some syndromes have common signs and a predictable course (e.g., benign rolandic epilepsy). Others, such as absence seizures, are less specific and may include several subgroups with different outcomes and different associated features. Still others are rather loose collections of a few common characteristics irregularly linked together. Widely accepted syndromes in childhood include the West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, several myoclonic syndromes, febrile seizures of infancy, absence epilepsy, benign partial epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. If the concept of epileptic syndromes is to be practically useful, it should be limited to clusters that are unequivocally identifiable. Heterogeneous epileptic syndromes such as West syndrome or absence epilepsies give only a limited guide to prognosis but may be important in determining investigations and treatment. A classification based on syndromes has the advantage of dispensing with most assumptions required by other systems. However, it cannot cover all the clinical aspects of epilepsy and gives no guide to the pathophysiology, genetics, and etiology of a seizure disorder. The ultimate goal remains the delineation of disease entities.\r"

  ".U": "89137007\r", 
  ".W": "About 75% of patients with epilepsy have seizures during childhood, often requiring antiepileptic therapy. Children possess all the drug-specific pharmacokinetic features of adults (e.g., nonlinearity of phenytoin elimination and autoinduction of carbamazepine metabolism), plus other factors (e.g., age, intercurrent illness, comedication) that influence dosage. Kinetic differences are maximal in newborns and infants, with limited drug elimination in premature and full-term babies, soon followed by accelerated elimination during infancy and childhood, before lower adult elimination rates develop during late childhood or early adolescence. Most children with epilepsy require two- to fourfold larger doses relative to bodyweight than adults, to achieve comparable drug levels and therapeutic effects. Although rapid growth may require increased dosage, the need is limited as relative clearance declines with age. Children of any age, but particularly premature and newborn babies, show greater individual variability in drug handling and therefore in dose requirements than adults. Clinical response and antiepileptic drug concentrations should both be monitored carefully in children.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the current trend toward monotherapy, polytherapy in children with epilepsy is still common. A drug combination is advantageous only if it achieves a higher efficacy:toxicity ratio (therapeutic index) or if its antiepileptic spectrum is wider. Studies of brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs have so far shown that a higher efficacy:toxicity ratio is not achieved by most combinations. Problems are associated with drug combinations. First, numerous pharmacokinetic interactions are documented. These interactions, which can be associated with significant changes in blood levels at a given dose, make frequent measurements and dosage readjustments necessary. They can also alter the concentration of active metabolites or the free fraction of a drug. Second, toxicity can be assumed to be at least partially cumulative, since reduction in polytherapy has been shown to be associated with a reduction in side effects. Third, the therapeutic range appears to depend on whether a drug is taken alone or in combination, so that polytherapy confuses the interpretation of serum drug measurements. Fourth, the presence of more than one drug will add to the difficulty in evaluating the efficacy or side effects of any single drug. Finally, a pharmacodynamic interaction between valproate and several other antiepileptics, particularly the barbiturates, can lead to a stuporous state. Transition from polytherapy to monotherapy is much more difficult to achieve than the opposite.\r"

  ".W": "In both adults and children, the seizure type and frequency of occurrence largely determine the burden of epilepsy, for the patient and his family. Epilepsy in children can range from the severe to the relatively benign, and it is important to make the correct diagnosis as early as possible. In those under 5 years of age, epilepsy often presents as an age-related syndrome, e.g., West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Later, typical absences and generalized tonic-clonic convulsions are more usual. Drug therapy should take account of the different pharmacodynamics of antiepileptic drugs in children, and phenobarbital should be avoided. Rectal diazepam has an important role in the emergency management of childhood seizures. Psychological difficulties may be manifested by both the child and the parents. They should be prevented if possible by active intervention at an early stage after diagnosis, or managed on a continuing basis by expert medical and paramedical advice. The aim of such counseling is to ensure, so far as is possible, that the epileptic child develops normally in a normal family environment.\r"

The presence of vitronectin could not be shown in washed permeabilised platelets. Vitronectin was very much increased in reactive and fibrotic tissue, as was fibronectin. This was observed in lymph nodes affected by both nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease and by metastatic carcinoma as well as in myelofibrotic bone marrow and sclerotic glomeruli. These findings suggest that vitronectin may have an important role in the processes of inflammation and repair.\r"

The largest single reason for poor marginal adaptation was marginal fracture. Up to 2 years, the marginal integrity of the studied posterior composites was superior to that of an amalgam alloy. It was determined that smaller cavities, greater bulk of resin at the margin (especially at functional cusp areas), and well-finished margins without overfiling seem to reduce the occurrence of marginal fracture on composite resin restorations.\r"

Jean Cruveilhier is usually credited with having first illustrated the lesions of multiple sclerosis in the second tome of his pathological atlas which bears the title date 1835. But the 40 livraisons which make up this work were published separately in parts and documentary evidence contained within the second volume indicates that the putative case of multiple sclerosis cannot have appeared earlier than 1841. Robert Carswell also may have published his pathological atlas in parts but the work was completed by 1838 and so his depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis, appearing on plate 4 fig 1, predates Cruveilhier's by at least three years. Curiously, Carswell and Cruveilhier each observed their pathological material in Paris but they cannot have depicted the same individual. 1988 is therefore the 150th anniversary of the depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis; the unnamed patient was French, the illustrator a Scotsman.\r"

The muscle strength of 11 muscle groups was measured with a hand-held dynamometer. The sum of force improved significantly in the seven patients (mean increase: 17%, p less than 0.05; 95% confidence interval: 7.2-26.8%). Endurance tests showed an improvement in the performance of 30 full kneebends. Surface EMG measurement showed no change in the muscle fibre conduction velocity or power spectra during treatment. The integrated EMG showed a (non significant) mean increase of 21%.\r"

Studies of human sera from infected individuals indicate that group-specific neutralization antigens common to most isolates of HIV-1 exist, and that some HIV-2 antisera cross-neutralize HIV-1. Neutralization epitopes for HIV-1 have been identified and mapped, including a group-specific antigen on gp41, and a type-specific antigen on gp120. Neutralization \"escape\" mutants have been selected in vitro with a neutralizing mab to the type-specific antigenic loop. The CD4 antigen binds HIV-1 gp120 with high affinity and acts as the receptor on human and simian T-lymphocytes and monocytes for all strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV tested. Following binding to the CD4 receptor, HIV becomes internalized by a pH-independent process. The principle binding domain for gp120 is located in the N-terminal V domain of CD4. Anti-idiotypic sera to CD4 mabs recognizing the same site weakly neutralize HIVs of many strains, and soluble, recombinant forms of CD4 strongly neutralize HIV. Neither anti-CD4 mabs nor sCD4 inhibit the low level of plating of HIV observed on tumour cells in culture of glial (brain) and muscle origin, indicating that CD4 is not essential for infection of these cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Despite von Bergmann's work in the Franco-Prussian War and Makins' experiences in the Boer conflict, military surgeons in World War I were unprepared for the nature and extent of intracranial injuries. Poor triage, disorganized transportation, incomplete surgery, and sepsis resulted in a mortality of over 50%. In 1915, as a volunteer to the Ambulance Americaine near Paris, Harvey Cushing spent 5 weeks observing the Allied medical system. He quickly recognized the technical importance of early, definitive intracranial surgery and the logistical requirements for a unified triage system located along the main lines of traffic. Cushing returned to France in 1917 as director of Base Hospital #5, known as the Harvard Unit. Immediately detached to the British Expeditionary Force, he operated at a smaller casualty clearing station close to the Belgian front. The patients treated during the third battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) formed the basis of his technical reports. He standardized intracranial injuries into nine categories with separate mortality rates. In addition, he recommended the surgical techniques of en bloc bone resection under local anesthesia with suction debridement and primary two-layer closure. Shell fragments were removed by magnets when possible; dichloramine-T was used as an antiseptic. By reducing infection and secondary complications, Cushing halved the earlier mortality rates. In September 1918, as senior consultant to the American Expeditionary Force, Cushing was in charge of organizing the neurosurgical care for the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives. His instruction of individual surgeons in operative techniques and the creation of identified hospital centers with suitable equipment and trained personnel helped to establish neurological surgery as a military specialty.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomical location of the thalamic target (ventrolateral nucleus) during stereotactic thalamotomy for a movement disorder was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to define the anterior and posterior commissures and the intercommissural plane. Precise targeting was confirmed by intraoperative stereotactic computed tomography (CT), electrophysiological stimulation, and a gratifying postoperative response (disappearance of contralateral tremor and rigidity). The use of a MRI- and CT-compatible stereotactic coordinate frame allowed multiplanar imaging with excellent spatial and contrast resolution, visualization of the source of the tremor (prior embolic stroke affecting the dentatorubrothalamic pathway), and correction for the more medial location of the internal capsule in this patient. Location did not vary among target sites seen with MRI and CT imaging techniques. In this patient MRI during stereotactic thalamotomy supplemented CT and the electrophysiological technique that we conventionally use to define the ventrolateral nucleus. Although the importance of possible magnetic susceptibility imaging artifacts remains to be elucidated, stereotactic MRI may prove sufficiently accurate in the future to replace other imaging techniques used during functional neurosurgery.\r"

Many are already choosing chorionic villus sampling despite the questions that remain regarding risks and diagnostic accuracy. Risk figures for miscarriages due to the procedure and for intrauterine infection are especially needed. The issues of maternal contamination in laboratory analyses and chromosomal mosaicism that may not be present in the fetus are also of prime importance. Collaborative efforts continue to answer these and other questions so that in the future patients will be better able to make informed decisions regarding prenatal diagnosis.\r"

Doppler examination of the umbilical and uterine arteries has become the most accurate test to establish a fetal prognosis in patients with hypertension in pregnancy.

Surgical removal of the bulk of the disease in an attempt to shorten the hospital course and decrease the amount of chemotherapy required appears to be of value. This approach to therapy should therefore be considered in most patients with nonmetastatic disease without regard to the histologic diagnosis if they have completed their families. \"Debulking\" of primary uterine disease in the presence of metastases may decrease the chemotherapy necessary for cure and removes a potential source of resistant disease. Pulmonary surgery improves survival rates for patients with a solitary, resistant lung tumor and is advisable under the circumstances outlined herein. Craniotomy is rarely of value in the management of tumor in the brain but may be necessary in emergency situations caused by intracerebral hemorrhage. Surgery to control complications of the disease has been proved to be safe with acceptable morbidity even if performed during chemotherapy. Thus, although chemotherapy has replaced surgery as the primary management of patients with gestational trophoblastic disease, there remain a significant number of patients in whom surgery plays a significant role.\r"

Operative complications can be minimized by careful technique and are more often seen in emergency than elective cases. Prophylactic antibiotics are of some benefit in reducing postoperative endometritis in patients with risk factors. Cesarean birth rarely causes the death of a newborn. Nevertheless, significant newborn pulmonary problems, especially respiratory distress syndrome, may follow an inappropriately timed cesarean delivery. Careful attention to clinical measures and supporting evidence of pulmonary maturity from ultrasound will avoid most instances of iatrogenic prematurity. Amniocentesis, with a higher complication rate than ultrasound, may still be required to prove pulmonary maturity in some circumstances. If concern or doubt precludes elective delivery of patients with previous low transverse uterine incisions, one can wait for the patient to go into spontaneous labor.\r"

There is always a risk in attempting to elaborate excessively on such a common operation. Each of us will develop our own personal biases based on individual experience and expertise. These differences are superficially distinct but usually have underlying similarities that allow us to achieve similar outcomes and expectations. At the same time, however, it is important to recognize that there is a difference between repetition and habit as opposed to altering a technique in order to meet a specific end. Obviously, with cesarean section, there can be several ways to accomplish the same result, and certain situations will dictate the individualization (patient, not physician) of technique. Certainly, one has to be aware of his or her own expertise and at the same time know his or her options. It seems best not to limit oneself to the same technique under all circumstances but to be able to anticipate problems and know how to rectify them in a manner that will avoid undue injury or compromise to the infant and mother.\r"

As an increasing segment of the obstetric population becomes older, and with better survival of medical diseases, the profession as a whole will be challenged by these patients.

A variety of types of fetal injuries have been reported, and some are associated with permanent handicap. The relative risk of intraoperative complications varies widely depending on such clinical variables as gestational age, station of the presenting part, and the experience of the operating physician. Ideally, each physician should be able to review his or her rate and type of complications so that continuous improvement in technique is fostered. Gynecologic tumors (malignant and benign) are rarely associated with pregnancy, and their incidental finding at the time of cesarean section is also rare. Management of malignant tumors depends greatly on the stage of the tumor. Conservative management of early-stage malignant ovarian tumors is permissible. More advanced malignant ovarian tumors and malignant tumors of the uterus and fallopian tube should be treated aggressively with removal of the reproductive organs.\r"

The effects of near-normoglycemia (CSII and MI) on oscillatory potentials (electroretinography [ERG]) and macular recovery time (nyctometry) were studied prospectively for 41 months. Before randomization, the amplitudes of oscillatory potentials were negatively correlated to age (P = 0.002) and positively correlated to the diameter of retinal veins (P less than 0.05). Men had shorter macular recovery time than women (P = 0.03). Nyctometry and oscillatory potentials were not related to mean blood glucose values, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1), retinopathy, blood pressure levels, or duration of diabetes. Changes in metabolic control (MI and CSII; P less than 0.01) and in microaneurysms and hemorrhages (CSII and CIT) during the study did not affect oscillatory potentials or nyctometry. Soft exudates (15 patients) and proliferative retinopathy (1 patient) transiently developed with MI and CSII regimens. No changes in oscillatory potentials or nyctometry were observed and no pretreatment characteristics of these parameters predicted the occurrence of these ischemic lesions. At the stage of proliferation, however, lowered amplitudes of oscillatory potentials and lengthened macular recovery time were observed.\r"

All three patients had bilateral cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis managed by intravitreal injection of ganciclovir. Culture of the retina for CMV was negative in all three cases. The finding of HIV in multiple ocular tissues is consistent with the neurotropic nature of the virus, and may explain some of the common ocular manifestations of AIDS such as AIDS retinopathy. Infection with HIV may predispose the retina to other opportunistic infections and may explain the high incidence of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. This is the first report of HIV isolation from tissue within the eye.\r"

  ".W": "During the last 10-15 years, a number of reliable and valid measures for assessing chronic pain syndromes and evaluating treatment have been proposed and tested. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, these measures have been drawn from physiological, psychological (emotional, cognitive, and behavioral), sociocultural, and economic studies. Together they form the definition of a chronic pain data base which can assist in classifying chronic pain syndromes, assessing patients for treatment, and evaluating the results of treatment. Since all measurement is indirect, reliability, validity, and appropriateness for use in multivariate analysis have been the major selection criteria. Along with these assessment measures, a set of risk factors, judged as affecting both the incidence of chronic pain and response to treatment, have been reviewed. It has become clear that to further the scientific knowledge and clinical understanding of the chronic pain syndrome and its treatment, data using such a set of reliable measures must be collected. Furthermore, these data should be analyzed using current multivariate methodology which gives attention to measurement error as well as to causal interactions and control issues. Fortunately, the tools are now becoming available, just as consumers and certifiers of chronic pain treatment are demanding careful program evaluation and an account of results.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical usefulness of M-mode echocardiography for predicting severe mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring valve replacement was assessed in 16 men and 10 women with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) as sole primary cardiac disorder. From left ventricular (LV) angiography, MR was classified as none to moderate (8 cases, group A) or severe (18 cases, group B). At echocardiography, increased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic and left atrial (LA) dimensions, corrected for body-surface area, distinguished group B from group A, with the best validities for LA and LV end-diastolic values. The mean echocardiographic LV fractional shortening and ejection fraction (EF) and the angiographic EF were similar in both groups. Echocardiographic and angiocardiographic LV EF correlated poorly, the former usually overestimating the latter. LV end-diastolic and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were highest in group B, and the latter correlated with echocardiographic LA size. Mitral valve replacement was subsequently performed on 15 of the 18 group B patients. M-mode echocardiography is a valuable adjuvant to clinical assessment of MVP for predicting MR severity and for time-planning of cardiac catheterization or mitral valve surgery.\r"

The myocardial perfusion after declamping of only the mammary artery averaged 61% of the perfusion found after declamping also the aorta. Laser Doppler flowmetry is proposed to offer a means of monitoring regional myocardial perfusion in the phase immediately after internal mammary artery grafting.\r"

Its prevalence is higher in North America than in Europe--between 9% and 12% of the population. Reduced energy expenditure from exercise or metabolism or both may be an important contributory factor in the development of obesity because of a failure to reduce food intake sufficiently to maintain energy balance. A high ratio of abdominal circumference relative to gluteal circumference carries a twofold or greater risk of heart attack, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, and death. The effect of increased quantities of abdominal fat is greater than that of a similar increase in total body fat on the risks of ill health associated with obesity. Genetic factors appear to contribute about 25% to its etiology.\r"

New diagnostic, care, and treatment approaches are having a tremendous impact; yet, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are intimately linked to preventable factors such as smoking, improper nutrition, alcohol misuse, lack of exercise, and maladaptive behaviors. Compelling evidence indicates that reducing risk factors yields substantial overall health benefits and saves lives. Prevention efforts can be applied effectively at many points in a disease process, and clinical medicine has a significant role. Nonetheless, a number of barriers may interfere. These include physician education and attitudes; patient education, expectations, and motivations; and aspects of the health care delivery system itself, such as access and reimbursement. The situation has been complicated by the apparent lack of consensus on the appropriate frequency and scope of such activities.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model of chronic and excessive voluntary (unforced) alcohol ingestion is presented in which, by drinking, animals produce repeated, substantial elevations in blood ethanol concentration and develop physical dependence. The overindulgence is elective in that ethanol is chosen in preference to certain other fluid-ingestive alternatives. Beside the usual demonstrations of acutely compromised motor performance, tolerance development, cross-tolerance, etc., the model demonstrates that the consequences of even short, but continued, daily drinking episodes results in the disruption of reinforced behavior that occurs later in the day when blood ethanol is absent (impaired general functioning). The conditions which induce the ethanol overindulgence can generate a variety of behavioral excesses which places alcoholism in a context of environmentally determined malfunctions that are subject to therapeutic change by altering situational parameters. Efficacious experiments utilizing therapeutic and preventive strategies are described that may serve as suggestions for corresponding human alcoholism intervention strategies.\r"
