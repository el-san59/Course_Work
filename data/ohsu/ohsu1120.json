  ".W": "To evaluate the pulsatile mode of immunoactive LH release during physiological lactational amenorrhea, we withdrew blood samples at 10-min intervals for 24 h from breastfeeding women (n = 9) at both 3 weeks and 3 months postpartum. Nonlactating women (n = 7) were sampled similarly in the early follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle. Objective LH pulse analysis revealed that the mean frequencies of pulsatile LH release were similar at both times postpartum and in menstruating young women. By 3 months postpartum, mean serum PRL concentrations had declined 50%, and serum LH peak areas doubled. In contrast, LH interpulse interval, peak duration, and maximal, incremental, and fractional LH pulse amplitude did not change significantly. When deconvolution analysis was used to assess pituitary responses to two pulses of exogenous GnRH at 3 months (vs. 3 weeks) postpartum, we found significant increases in maximal LH secretory rates and the total mass of LH secreted. There was no change in the duration or timing of the evoked LH secretory burst and/or the estimated half-life of endogenous LH. In summary, during lactational amenorrhea, pulsatile LH release occurs at a mean frequency no different from that in the normal early follicular phase. As hyperprolactinemia wanes, there is increased pituitary responsiveness to exogenously administered GnRH and a doubling of spontaneous serum LH concentration peak areas. Such amplitude changes are consistent with the hypothesis of increased endogenous GnRH drive (e.g. augmented GnRH secretion per burst and/or increased pituitary responsiveness to available GnRH) during recovery of the postpartum hypothalamopituitary-ovarian axis.\r"

Maximal capacity (Vmax) and affinity (Km) for glucose uptake in whole body (WBGU) and leg skeletal muscle (LGU) were measured during a 120 mU/m2.min insulin infusion, and blood glucose was clamped at about 4, 7, 12, and 21 mmol/L. LGU = femoral arterio-venous glucose difference (FAVGD) X leg blood flow (LBF). Compared to C, IDDMs had about 35% lower rates of WBGU at all glucose levels (P less than 0.01). The FAVGD (millimoles per L) in C vs. IDDM was 1.23 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.09, 2.44 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.24 +/- 0.16, 2.91 +/- 0.18 vs. 2.91 +/- 0.30, and 3.27 +/- 0.12 vs. 3.35 +/- 0.4 (P = NS at each glucose). LBF (decaliters per min) was reduced in IDDM vs. C [2.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.4 (P less than 0.05), 3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.05), 2.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.8 (P less than 0.01), and 3.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.8 (P less than 0.01) at each glucose level]. Kinetic analysis revealed that 1) the Vmax for WBGU and LGU were reduced in IDDM vs. C (P less than 0.05), and 2) the Vmax for skeletal muscle glucose extraction (FAVGD) was identical in C and IDDM (3.6 mmol/L). The Km values for WBGU, LGU, and glucose extraction were not different in C and IDDM (approximately 6 mmol/L). Thus, in IDDM 1) decreased glucose uptake is due to reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake; 2) muscle glucose extraction is normal, but blood flow is reduced; and thus, 3) in IDDM, IR is due to reduced glucose and insulin delivery (blood flow) to skeletal muscle. This represents a novel mechanism for in vivo IR.\r"

  ".W": "We studied a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and type B insulin resistance, who progressed from extreme insulin resistance to fasting hypoglycemia. The plasma insulin level was 63.3 +/- 20.9 pmol/L in the fasting state and rose above 1440 pmol/L postprandially. Intravenous administration of human insulin caused almost no decline in plasma glucose. Therefore, it was concluded that the patient was still resistant to insulin and that plasma insulin did not play a crucial role in the development of hypoglycemia. Immunoglobulin G from this patient did not inhibit insulin binding to the insulin receptor; rather, it enhanced [125I]insulin binding in both the immunoprecipitate and the in vitro binding assay to intact cells. Antiinsulin receptor antibodies strongly inhibited insulin internalization in human adipocytes, slowed down the dissociation of [125I]insulin from receptors and failed to induce down-regulation of surface insulin receptors in both the presence and absence of insulin. Finally, autoantibodies mimicked the insulin stimulatory effect on human fat cell lipogenesis even after long term exposure, but inhibited the metabolic potency of insulin when added simultaneously with the natural ligand. We conclude that antiinsulin receptor antibodies induce fasting hypoglycemia, through their continuous receptor stimulatory action, and insulin resistance, possibly by a conformational perturbation of the receptor protein, which, in turn, uncouples insulin receptor binding from receptor function.\r"

  ".U": "91341045\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the relationships between the structure and affinity of two insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) purified from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Competitive binding studies were performed using preparations of human recombinant IGF (rhIGF-I, rhIGF-II, and their labeled homologs) and the truncated variant form of IGF-I, rh-Des-(1-3)-IGF-I. One of these BPs, which is the most consistently detected in CSF, corresponds to IGFBP-2. The other is a new form whose N-terminal sequence we reported earlier, which we call the 32-30K BP on the basis of its electrophoretic migration. Comparisons were made with an IGFBP-1 preparation purified from amniotic fluid and with two BPs purified from human serum, which are homologous to the CSF BPs. The CSF BPs have particularly strong affinities for IGF-II. The estimated affinity constants (Ka) were 2 X 10(10) M-1 for IGFBP-2 and 10(11) M-1 for the 32-30K BP. These affinities were 15-20 and 70 times stronger than the respective affinities for IGF-I. The affinity of the 32-30K BP is the strongest among the BPs identified to date. The two BPs isolated from serum, which correspond to the 32-30K CSF BP and IGFBP-2, had affinities for IGF-II and IGF-I similar to those of the CSF BPs. IGFBP-1 had nearly identical affinities for the two IGFs of approximately 10(10) M-1. Des-(1-3)-IGF-I failed to bind to the CSF BPs, but bound to IGFBP-1, although with a 40-fold weaker affinity than IGF-I. From our data it would seem that IGFBP-1 has two classes of IGF-binding site, one of high and one of low (less than 10(9) M-1) affinity for both IGFs. The other two BPs, by contrast, each possess a predominant class of high affinity binding site for IGF-II. A second class of lower affinity (greater than 10(9) M-1) sites bind both IGF-I and IGF-II. In the case of the 32-30K BP, these preferentially bind IGF-II; in the case of IGFBP-2, their binding of the two IGFs is similar. These different types of binding site may play an important role in controlling the bioavailability of IGF-I and IGF-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Baseline and stimulated levels of A'dione rose significantly before the onset of puberty in female children (group 2 vs. group 3, P less than 0.01). The calculated ratio of 17OH Preg/17OH Prog in group 1 was significantly higher than that in other groups of children (P less than 0.01). The calculated, baseline DHEA/A'dione ratio was higher in group 1 than in older children (P less than 0.01). Stimulated ratios were higher in late pubertal females than in males (P less than 0.01). In both sexes baseline and stimulated ratios of 17OH Prog/deoxycorticosterone increased in puberty, such that late pubertal children had higher levels than prepubertal children (P less than 0.01). These data confirm the need for interpretation ACTH stimulation test data to be based upon age- and sex-specific norms.\r"

These keratinocyte proteins are approximately 125 kD and 240 kD in size, respectively. We also have isolated clones containing alpha-fodrin and protein 4.1 sequences from a human keratinocyte cDNA library. These sequences confirm the active transcription in keratinocytes of the alpha-fodrin and protein 4.1 genes.

  ".W": "Long-term cultures of melanocytes were established from 14 subjects with vitiligo and from five normal controls and analyzed ultrastructurally. Cultured melanocytes from 78.6% of the vitiligo patients demonstrated abnormalities that consisted of 1) dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), 2) circular RER profiles, and/or 3) membrane bound compartments of melanosomes. Cultured melanocytes from control subjects were predominantly normal with only one of the normal cultures demonstrating minimal circular RER profiles. The three unique abnormal structures in cultured vitiligo melanocytes were not always concomitantly expressed and could not be associated with any specific clinical feature of vitiligo. Quantitative analysis of the RER demonstrated that the profiles of dilated RER in cultured vitiligo melanocytes expressed a significant 1.5-2.8-times increase in mean cisternal area over cultured control melanocytes (i.e., 5.41-9.92 microns 2 versus 3.53 microns 2, respectively). The cisterna of the dilated RER profiles frequently contained floccular material that appeared to originate from the ribosomes, an indication that the floccular material may be translation products. The dilation of RER in melanocytes from the same patient persisted through repeated subculturing for up to 14.75 months. Epidermal melanocytes in biopsied skin from a patient whose cultured melanocytes were aberrant also demonstrated dilated and circular RER profiles. These results demonstrate that melanocytes from most vitiligo patients express an innate defect when cultured. Although this defect does not appear to be cytotoxic in vitro, this abnormality may be the primary defect that elicits melanocyte destruction in vivo.\r"

Immune cells were few in number and not associated with follicles. Dramatic changes were observed during regression in catagen; class I MHC was expressed on all follicle epithelium, large numbers of activated macrophages aggregated around the follicles, and the chondroitin proteoglycans disappeared from the follicle sheath and dermal papilla. During the resting stage, telogen, class I MHC remained on cells of the secondary germ, but macrophages and chondroitin proteoglycans were absent.

To clarify the role of EBV in the development of the lesions, we used filter in situ DNA hybridization to determine the prevalence of EBV and of human papillomavirus (HPV) in epithelial cells obtained on swabs from the tongue of HIV-infected patients who had hairy leukoplakia, HIV-infected patients who did not have hairy leukoplakia, and healthy uninfected control persons. In samples collected from the 35 uninfected control persons, EBV DNA could not be detected except at low concentrations in three people. In contrast, all but one of the samples from 11 HIV-infected patients who had hairy leukoplakia contained EBV DNA. Of greatest interest, in 19 of 32 HIV-infected patients who had no signs of hairy leukoplakia, EBV DNA was also detected on the epithelium of the tongue. DNA filter in situ hybridization for the detection of HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 in all cases yielded negative results. Statistical analysis showed that the presence of EBV DNA was significantly correlated with the clinical status of the HIV-infected persons, as determined by Walter Reed staging classification, whereas hairy leukoplakia was not. It is concluded that detection of EBV DNA in oral epithelium may be an earlier and more powerful predictor of progression to AIDS than is hairy leukoplakia.\r"

In the early period of the cultures, TIL were predominantly T cells of CD8+ phenotype and contained 10-30% of CD3- cells. Four of the five early TIL cultures tested in a cytotoxicity assay displayed a degree of MHC-unrestricted lysis on a series of autologous and allogenic melanoma cell lines as well as the K562 natural killer-sensitive target. With longer periods of time in culture, all TIL lines showed a decrease in lytic activity that was associated with the loss of CD3- cells. Thus, most of the killing of short-term TIL cultures appeared to be mediated by CD3- natural killer cells, whereas CD3+ T cells were found to be weak anti-tumor effectors. Even though the CD3+ T cells were not cytotoxic on K562 targets, their lytic activity (even weak) against melanoma cells appeared to be non-MHC restricted, and was blocked by anti-CD3 antibodies. In addition, cytotoxicity of the CD3+ TIL cultures was compared to that of a CD3-/NKH1+ cell line purified from peripheral blood. It was found that natural killer cells were much more potent than CD3+ TIL on the melanoma cell lines tested.\r"

An impaired wound healing model was first established in guinea pigs by isolating flaps of skin and irradiating the flaps to 15 Gray in one fraction using a 4-MeV linear accelerator. Incisions made 2 d after irradiation were excised 7 d later, and showed decreased linear wound bursting strength (WBS) as compared to non-irradiated control wounds on the contralateral side of each animal (p = 0.001). The effect of TGF-beta on healing of radiation-impaired wounds was studied using this model. Skin on both left and right sides of guinea pigs was irradiated as above. A linear incision was made in each side. Collagen with either 1, 5, or 20 micrograms of TGF-beta was applied to one side prior to closure with staples, whereas the contralateral side received saline in collagen. Wounds given either 1 or 5 micrograms of TGF-beta were found to be stronger than controls at 7 d (p less than 0.05), whereas those receiving the higher 20-micrograms dose were weaker than controls (p less than 0.05). Thus, TGF-beta in lower doses improved healing at 7 d but very large amounts of the growth factor actually impaired healing. In situ hybridization done on wound samples showed increased type I collagen gene expression by fibroblasts in wounds treated with 1 micrograms TGF-beta over control wounds. These results indicate that TGF-beta improved wound healing as demonstrated by increased WBS. This improvement is accompanied by an up-regulation of collagen gene expression by resident fibroblasts.\r"

All could (12F2 greater than NKC greater than 25 greater than 12B2 greater than A431). Furthermore, exogenously added 1,25(OH)2D inhibited 1,25(OH)2D production and stimulated 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25(OH)2D] production in all cell lines but with different potency (25 = A431 greater than NKC greater than 12B2 greater than 12F2). Cellular binding studies suggested that the high-affinity binding site for 1,25(OH)2D in NKC is not found in 12F2 and 12B2. When the effect of 1,25(OH)2D on differentiation was determined, only NKC responded with an increase in cornified envelope formation, although some of the cell lines responded to the proliferative [at low 1,25(OH)2D concentration] or antiproliferative [at high 1,25(OH)2D concentration] effect of 1,25(OH)2D. Thus, although SCC lines synthesize 1,25(OH)2D and respond to exogenous 1,25(OH)2D with respect to appropriate regulation of endogenous 250HD metabolism, these cell lines fail to respond to the differentiating influence of this vitamin D metabolite.\r"

Glutathione S-transferase activity was found in the soluble cell fraction but not in the microsomal cell fraction. The glutathione S-transferase specific activity of the soluble cell fraction was found to increase as the keratinocytes differentiated in culture. All of the enzymatic activity was found to reside with a single isozymic form that was concluded to be the pi form of the enzyme based on substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors, molecular weight, and reactivity towards antibodies raised to alpha, mu, and pi forms of the enzyme. It is concluded that all of the isozymic forms of glutathione S-transferase noted in whole skin, with the exception of pi, are of extra-keratinocyte origin.\r"

The major metabolites produced by human skin in organ culture and by keratinocytes were N-desisopropylpropranolol (DIP), propranolol glycol (GLY), and naphthoxylactic acid (NLA). Formation of GLY and NLA was linear with incubation time up to 6 d and was directly proportional to propranolol concentration. Fibroblasts and melanocytes also produced GLY and NLA, but appeared to have lower propranolol-biotransforming activity than keratinocytes. The three metabolites detected arise from side-chain oxidation of propranolol, and the use of specific enzyme inhibitors determined that monoamine oxidase and cytochrome P450 isozymes are involved in their formation. Aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases are also probably involved in the formation of NLA and GLY, but attempts to inhibit these enzyme systems were inconclusive, possibly due to the chemical instability of the intermediate aldehyde resulting from monoamine oxidase activity. No evidence was found for conjugation or ring oxidation by the skin or isolated cells. Induction of keratinocyte differentiation with Ca++ or phorbol ester treatment resulted in an increase of overall biotransformation and the NLA/GLY ratio.\r"

  ".U": "91341213\r", 
  ".W": "Fresh and cultured human Langerhans cells display disparate functional programs, based on their capacities to activate autologous and allogeneic T cells, and with respect to their susceptibility to inhibition by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta). We have compared the functional properties of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) procured from uninvolved and involved skin of patients with psoriasis with fresh and cultured normal epidermal cells. Freshly obtained psoriatic epidermal APC resembled cultured normal epidermal cells in their superior capacity to activate syngeneic and allogeneic T cells; fresh normal epidermal cells failed to activate syngeneic T cells, and induced only modest proliferation among allogeneic T cells. The modest T-cell--activating properties of fresh, normal epidermal cells were not suppressed by TGF beta, whereas the T-cell--activating potential of psoriatic epidermal cells, cultured normal epidermal cells, and blood APC was inhibited approximately 50% by TGF beta. Thus, fresh psoriatic epidermal APC resemble cultured normal epidermal cells functionally. Because these properties are already evident in cells obtained from uninvolved psoriatic skin, the \"cultured\" functional phenotype of epidermal APC in this disease may precede the appearance of active psoriatic skin lesions. Surface marker analysis of normal and psoriatic epidermal cell suspensions revealed that virtually all of the bone marrow--derived cells in normal epidermal cell suspensions were conventional (CD1+) Langerhans cells, whereas CD1+ cells comprised only a minority of bone marrow--derived (CD45+) cells in psoriatic epidermis. It is speculated that some of the CD1-, CD45+ cells in psoriatic epidermis may be Langerhans cells that have lost their \"fresh\" phenotype. These data indicate that an abnormality in epidermal APC function exists in psoriatic skin--even before clinical lesions develop, and we speculate that the abnormal capacity of psoriatic epidermal APC to activate syngeneic T cells may be important in the expression of keratinocyte pathology. Because psoriatic epidermal APC functions were profoundly inhibited in vitro by treatment with cyclosporin A, the effectiveness of this drug in psoriasis may be due in part to its ability to inhibit epidermal antigen-presenting cell function in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91341214\r", 
  ".W": "Following incubation of murine epidermis in medium containing either interleukin-2 or interleukin-6, there is significant upregulation in the density of Ia+ epidermal Langerhans cells (to 159% and 175% of control, respectively). This cytokine-induced upregulation is abrogated by either rabbit or human IgG due to triggering of Fc gamma receptors. In contrast, human IgA does not inhibit the effect of interleukin-2 or interleukin-6. Using different isotypes of murine IgG, we have demonstrated that all subclasses are capable of inhibiting the cytokine-induced enhancement of Ia antigen, although IgG1 and IgG2b must be heat aggregated to be effective. The IgG-mediated events are dependent on prostaglandin synthesis because they can be blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, 10 micrograms/ml. The responsible PG appears to be PGD2; in contrast to its known inhibitory effect on macrophages, PGE2 does not inhibit the upregulation of Ia antigen on Langerhans cells. In addition, these IgG-mediated events are dependent upon the generation of cAMP because they can be blocked by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, 1 mM. Despite the apparently central role of PGD2 and cAMP in this process, triggering of the Fc gamma R by different isotypes of IgG blocks upregulation of Ia via at least two different pathways. The inhibition caused by aggregated IgG1 or IgG2b, which bind to Fc gamma RII on Langerhans cells, is abrogated by para-bromophenacylbromide, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. In contrast, the inhibition caused by monomeric IgG2a, which binds to Fc gamma RI most likely on keratinocytes, or monomeric IgG3, which probably binds to this same Fc gamma RI, is abrogated by staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, as well as by W7, a calmodulin antagonist. Finally, 1,2 dioctanoyl-rac-glycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, mimics the Ig-mediated events. Based on these findings, as well as studies using monoclonal antibodies to the murine Fc gamma receptors I and II, we conclude that, as is the case in murine macrophages, triggering of an epidermal Fc gamma RI, most likely on keratinocytes, results in the generation of cAMP via a Ca(++)-dependent protein kinase C pathway, whereas triggering of an epidermal Fc gamma RII, most likely on Langerhans cells, results in the elevation of cAMP via a phospholipase A2-mediated pathway. In contrast to the situation for macrophages, PGD2 is a vital intermediate in both pathways, perhaps because Langerhans cells have receptors for only this prostaglandin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

An increased level of collagenase mRNA and unaltered levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) collagen mRNA were found in all cutis laxa cell strains by dot blot hybridization. Reduced levels of elastin mRNA were also detected in these strains. However, no qualitative differences in these mRNA transcripts were detected between the control and cutis laxa fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis. Collagenase activity in fibroblast culture supernatants was then measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled type I collagen. Increased collagenolytic activity in cutis laxa fibroblast culture supernatants was also found. These data suggest that increased collagenase expression of fibroblasts is related to the structural abnormality of dermal connective tissue in cutis laxa.\r"

At 0.1-18 h after exposure to 12 kJ/m2 of 396-406 nm irradiation, thicknesses of back skin and ears were measured, and histologic changes were evaluated by using hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) and Giemsa's stains. Activities of eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes in epidermal and dermal homogenates were assessed by incubating the tissue homogenates with 3H-AA, followed by quantitation of the eicosanoids generated by radio-TLC. In irradiated protoporphyric mice, an increase of back-skin thickness was noted at 0.1 h, reaching a peak at 18 h, whereas maximal increase in ear thickness was observed at 12 h. Histologic changes included dermal edema, increased mast cell degranulation, and mononuclear cells in the dermis. In these irradiated protoporphyric animals, generations of 6 keto-PGF1a, PGF2a, PGE2, PGD2, and HETE by epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes were markedly suppressed at all the timepoints studied. Dermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes of irradiated protoporphyric mice generated increased amounts of PGE2 and HETE at 18 h, probably reflecting the presence of dermal cellular infiltrates. The suppression of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes was prevented by intraperitoneal injection of WR-2721, a sulfhydryl group generator, prior to irradiation, suggesting that the suppression was secondary to photo-oxidative damage of the enzymes during the in vivo phototoxic response. These results suggest that the effect of protoporphyrin and radiation on cutaneous eicosanoid metabolism in this animal model in vivo is that of a down regulation of the activities of epidermal eicosanoid-metabolizing enzymes.\r"

In paraffin-embedded tissue sections the main peak DNA index was based on normal epidermis, and ranged from 1.03 to 1.59 in KA and from 1.47-2.71 in SCC. The DNA Index (DI) discriminated KA from SCC in 17 of 22 cases (p less than 0.0007). The highest DNA content of single nuclei ranged from 9.0-18.0 picograms (pg) (DI 2.9-6.03) in KA and 14.8-38.6 pg (DI 4.0-11.03) in SCC. The highest DNA content discriminated KA from SCC in 16 of 22 cases (p less than 0.003). In fresh frozen tissue touch preparations from 15 of the same lesions, there was considerable overlap in DNA indices of KA (0.534-1.39) and SCC (0.464-1.41). Abnormal DNA peaks seen in histograms from three SCC in paraffin-embedded tissue sections were lost in the touch preparation histograms, probably due to inadequate sampling. Therefore, image analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections is better able to distinguish KA from SCC than touch preparations.\r"

  ".U": "91341220\r", 
  ".W": "A 135-kD conA-binding glycoprotein isolated from pig epidermis was previously localized to the surface of basal cells in stratified epithelia using affinity-purified antibodies. Preembedding immunoperoxidase electron microscopy has now shown that this glycoprotein is concentrated on the lateral surfaces of basal cells but is not detectable on those surfaces adjacent to the basement membrane indicating a role in cell-cell rather than cell-substrate interactions. The basal cell glycoprotein was shown to resemble the beta 1 subunit of the integrin family following the generation of a specific monoclonal antibody (M5.25). The epidermal glycoprotein recognized by M5.25 and by antibodies against the beta 1 fibronectin receptor from human placenta co-migrated on SDS gels under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Its response to disulphide reducing agents was characteristic of beta 1 integrin subunits. In addition, the basal cell glycoprotein was shown to bind to the 120-kD cell-binding fragment of fibronectin in a RGD-dependent manner. It was readily detected by immunoblotting whole cell lysates of cultured pig keratinocytes suggesting increased expression in cultured cells compared to fresh epithelial tissue. The results suggest that beta 1 integrin subunits may be involved in cell-cell interactions between basal keratinocytes in pig epidermis and that these receptors are lost from the cell surface during terminal differentiation. Thus modulation of beta 1 integrin subunit expression may play an important role in regulating differentiation in pig epidermis.\r"

IL-8 can be produced by several cell types present in the skin. Their relative potentials for IL-8 expression has, however, not yet been studied, due to the lack of convenient methods for quantitative comparison of specific mRNA amounts in different cell types. Using a new method for quantification, we compared specific IL-8 mRNA amounts in cultures of keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and monocytes, stimulated with interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Endothelial cells produced very high, fibroblasts and monocytes intermediate, and keratinocytes low amounts of IL-8 mRNA. We also studied the time course of IL-8 mRNA levels in the four cell types following IL-1 alpha stimulation, and found a clear difference both in onset and stability of the response. We discuss the different strength of the response at different time points in the cell types analyzed in relation to their possible role in regulation of the normal response to stimulation.\r"

The augmented adhesiveness of the patients' cells was also apparent when using monolayers of endothelial cells isolated from human skin. The levels of immune complexes, complement, alpha 2-macroglobulin, acute phase proteins (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and alpha 1-antitrypsin), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the patients' sera were within normal limits. When MNC were added to endothelial monolayers that had been incubated with either TNF alpha or the highest concentration of rIL-1 beta used in the study, both the patients' and control's cells exhibited a similar increase in attachment (p less than 0.01). Pretreatment of endothelium with interferon-gamma did not enhance the attachment of MNC from either group of subjects. The augmented adherence of the patient's MNC appears to be due to an abnormal adhesiveness of the lymphocytes rather than the monocytes and is not related to an enhanced expression of the cell-surface adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18. It is likely that the circulating MNC of psoriatic patients may be predisposed for extravasation into skin.\r"

Electron microscopy shows that the rat preputial gland resembles the human sebaceous gland, not only in terms of containing a sebocyte-like population of cells in an acinar arrangement at different maturational stages, but also in the morphology of its organelles such as abundant and sometimes atypical mitochondria, many perinuclear lysosomes with crystalline inclusions, lipid droplets of various sizes, and peroxisomes. Other cell types, among them duct and inflammatory cells, were evident in the tissue sections, but constituted a minor component. Responses to stimulation of the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase pathways were determined using preputial cells that had been both freshly dispersed and grown in monolayer culture. Stimulation with isoproterenol (IPR) or forskolin (FS) resulted in both cases in an increase of cyclic AMP binding of the regulatory (R) subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, as determined by photoaffinity labeling of R subunits with an azido analog of cyclic AMP ([32P]-8-azido cyclic AMP). Cells from the epidermis under comparable conditions responded to a lesser degree and with a different distribution of R subunit isoforms. There are, therefore, differences in receptor activity as well as in the transduction pathways between the two types of epithelial cell populations. These results indicate that the preputial gland contains precursor cells that differentiate in culture to retain specific molecular mechanisms of action mediated via cyclic AMP.\r"

In the present study, we investigated the effect of different anti-CD1a monoclonal antibodies (BL6, DMC1, and Na1/34) on T cell proliferation induced by allogeneic epidermal cells in vitro. A significant inhibition of the mixed skin cell-lymphocyte reaction was obtained with BL6 and DMC1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), which recognize the same epitope on CD1a molecule. The observed inhibition could not be related to a steric hindrance of MHC class II molecules, because Na1/34 MoAb, which reacts with another epitope on CD1a molecule, had no significant effect. BL6 and DMC1 MoAb interfered with an early event of T-cell activation, as shown by a time-course study. In the presence of these MoAb, the addition of exogenous interleukin 2 did not restore T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of anti-CD1a MoAb was not mediated by a suppressor factor released by Langerhans cells (LC). These present data suggest that CD1a molecule may have an important function in self peptide presentation by human Langerhans cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tannins of natural or synthetic origin are well-known adjuvants in topical anti-inflammatory therapy of skin diseases. In this study, the influence of synthetic tannin on neutrophil accumulation, enzyme release, and on the proinflammatory activity of neutrophil-derived enzymes was investigated. The results show that synthetic tannin (Tamol) specifically inhibits the neutrophil serine protease human leukocyte elastase (HLE) in an irreversible manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.3 microgram/ml. Exogenous protein partially abolished the tannin-dependent HLE inhibition (IC50 of Tamol at 1% protein-concentration:1.0 microgram/ml). Synthetic tannin did not influence the activities of other neutrophil enzymes like Cathepsin G, beta-glucuronidase, and myeloperoxidase. The specificity of Tamol for HLE was further substantiated by the lack of inhibition of other serine proteases. Additionally, Tamol had no effect on f-met-leu-phe-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and did not alter enzyme degranulation of neutrophils in response to f-met-leu-phe and opsonized zymosan. We conclude from our results that the anti-inflammatory properties of synthetic tannin may at least in part be due to inactivation of the proinflammatory protease HLE.\r"

Using both a short-term assay, thymidine incorporation, and a longer term assay, cell counting, to assess proliferative growth, we tested the activity of minoxidil in human keratinocyte cultures grown in 0.1 mM Ca(++). Minoxidil failed to stimulate growth in these assays. At concentrations of 5-10 micrograms per ml, minoxidil showed half-maximal inhibition of both EGF- and placental extract-stimulated thymidine incorporation. Minoxidil also inhibited proliferative growth in the presence or absence of placental extract. Direct measurement of the ability of minoxidil to compete for binding to the EGF receptor indicated that minoxidil probably does not bind to the EGF receptor. Minoxidil was not toxic, as keratinocytes continued to survive and grow, although at a slower rate, in the presence of minoxidil.\r"

Perivascular CD36+ DC were present in the lamina propria of all the specimens studied. They were also found in small numbers in the epithelium of clinically healthy mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects, but were practically absent from the epithelium of HL. CD36+ DC seemed to be regularly HLA-DR+ in HIV-subjects; this positivity was recognized only in some cells in the clinically healthy mucosa of HIV+ subjects, and practically never in HL. Because the only perivascular cells observed in the clinically healthy areas of HIV+ subjects were CD36+, we investigated the ultrastructure of perivascular DC in these same areas. These cells were characterized by the presence of a prominent Golgi apparatus, many lysosomes, and focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix. It may be concluded that 1) CD36+ DC are physiologic components of the oral mucosa, 2) they share some ultrastructural features with macrophages, 3) no differences in numbers were found between HIV+ and HIV- subjects, and 4) these cells are affected in their expression of HLA-DR antigens during HIV infection, particularly in areas of HL. This may be a hint that the antigen-presenting function of these cells in the oral mucosa is negatively affected during HIV infection.\r"

  ".U": "91341228\r", 
  ".W": "Involucrin is a 68-kd precursor of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes. During terminal differentiation, involucrin becomes covalently cross-linked to other proteins by a membrane-anchored calcium-activated transglutaminase (TG) to form part of the cornified envelope. To better understand this process, we have used vector-mediated gene transfer to express human involucrin in a variety of cell types. Authentic involucrin protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells (fibroblasts), PtK2 rat kangaroo kidney cells (simple epithelial), and rat epidermal keratinocytes (stratifying squamous epithelial). The expression vector included an independent transcription unit encoding the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene (neo-r) allowing selection of stable involucrin-positive, G418-resistant clonal cell lines. In each cell type, involucrin levels were comparable to the endogenous expression observed in SCC-13 cells. Immunofluorescence localization studies revealed a uniform involucrin distribution throughout the cytoplasm in each cell type. Elevation of intracellular calcium resulted in cross-linking of involucrin in both CHO cells and rat keratinocytes, a process that was inhibited by EDTA and cystamine. In contrast, no cross-linking was observed in PtK2 cells or long-term passaged rat keratinocytes. Transglutaminase assays showed that rat keratinocytes contain predominantly a particulate (type I) form, whereas CHO cells contain only soluble TG (type II). PtK2 cells and long-term passaged keratinocytes, which were unable to cross-link involucrin, contained barely detectable TG activity. These results indicate 1) that involucrin is an efficient in situ substrate for both type I and type II transglutaminase and 2) that involucrin cross-linking is strictly TG dependent.\r"

By in situ hybridization 77% (10 of 13) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 69% (nine of 13) positive results were obtained. Because HPV genital infection is linked to penile and cervical dysplasia, polymerase chain reaction provides a powerful and highly sensitive tool for epidemiologic studies on sexual transmission of HPV.\r"

To assess whether the symptoms may be caused by alterations in the cutaneous innervation, skin from the affected area of patients (n = 5) was compared with controls (n = 10) comprising the contralateral unaffected area from the same patients and site-matched biopsies of normals, using immunohistochemistry. Frozen sections were immunostained with antisera to the neuropeptides substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and neuropeptide with tyrosine, and to the general neural marker PGP 9.5 and the glial marker S-100 to show the overall innervation and glial cells, respectively. No discernible change in the distribution of neuropeptide-immunoreactive axons was found, but all of the specimens from the affected areas had a significant increase in the number of intradermal PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers compared with unaffected areas from the same patients and normal controls. Epidermal dendritic cells immunoreactive for S-100, possibly Langerhans cells, were substantially increased. It is concluded that there is an increase in the sensory epidermal innervation in the affected skin areas in notalgia paresthetica, which could contribute to the symptoms, and that neural immunohistochemistry of skin biopsies could be helpful in the diagnosis of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of beta 4 integrins in adult and fetal human skin as well as in cultured keratinocytes was studied by immunodetection with monoclonal antibodies, and compared with that of beta 1 integrins. The distribution of the beta 1 and beta 4 integrin epitopes was entirely different in the adult epidermis. As reported previously by us (J Clin Invest 84:1916, 1989), the beta 1 epitopes were present most prominently at lateral cell-cell contact points, whereas staining with the beta 4 antibody demonstrated a linear staining pattern polarizing to the basal surface juxtaposed to the dermal-epidermal basement membrane. In contrast, in fetal skin, the staining patterns both with beta 1 and beta 4 antibodies were similar and demonstrated the presence of epitopes surrounding the entire cell surface of both basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. Distinct polarization of beta 4 integrin epitopes was noted in cultured keratinocytes maintained in low-calcium (0.15 mM) medium, and the expression of these integrins was also noted in human papilloma virus-transformed keratinocytes. Switch of the cultures to high-calcium (1.2 mM) medium resulted in redistribution of the epitopes to a pattern suggesting their location at under-surface of the cells adjacent to the substratum. This Ca(++)-induced redistribution of beta 4 integrin epitopes could be counteracted by 10(-7) M vitamin D3. Finally, incubation with anti-beta 4 integrin antibody reduced the capacity of keratinocytes to attach to plastic substratum. The results provide further evidence for the role of beta 4 integrins in cell-matrix interactions.\r"

Levels of this shed receptor are considered to be a measure of in vivo T-lymphocyte activation, and are elevated in the sera of many patients with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Fifteen of the thirty (50%) patients with DH had elevated levels of soluble IL-2R compared to one of 31 (3%) healthy HLA-B8 or HLA-DR3 control subjects (p less than 0.00001) and one of 10 (10%) healthy non-HLA-B8/-DR3 subjects (p less than 0.0018). In addition, the mean soluble IL-2R level in the patients with DH (744 +/- 381 U/ml) was also significantly higher than that seen in 31 healthy HLA B8 or HLA DR3 individuals (388 +/- 160 U/ml, p = 0.0001) and 10 healthy non-HLA-B8/DR3 individuals (397 +/- 201 U/ml, p = 0.002). Only two of the 30 patients with DH had active skin lesions at the time of serum sampling, one of whom had elevated levels of IL-2R. Measurement of soluble IL-2R levels in sequential serum samples, available in four patients with DH at times of active and inactive skin disease, demonstrated a temporal association between soluble IL-2R level elevations and active skin disease in two patients and no association in two patients. In one patient a marked elevation in soluble IL-2R levels occurred with the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, which decreased by 14% with institution of a gluten-free diet. In order to determine if soluble IL-2R levels are related to the mucosal immune response, the IL-2R levels were compared to the level of IgA antibodies directed against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin. Ten of eleven (91%) patients with circulating IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies were also found to have elevated levels of IL-2R. In contrast, in the patients with no detectable IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies, only four of 16 (25%) had elevated levels of IL-2R (p = 0.001). Because IL-2R levels are not related to activity of the skin disease in patients with DH but are associated with the presence of IgA antibodies against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin, these results suggest that some of the T-cell activation commonly present in DH reflects an ongoing immune response in the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

The present studies focused on further characterizing the interaction between fibronectin and keratinocytes, specifically addressing whether human keratinocytes utilize multiple adhesion promoting sequences within fibronectin. Initially, direct cell-binding assays were utilized in which keratinocyte adhesion to plastic substrata coated with fibronectin or proteolytic fragments of fibronectin was quantified. Intact fibronectin, a 75-kD proteolytic fragment containing the RGD sequence, and 33/66-kD cell adhesion/heparin binding fragments lacking the RGD sequence derived from the A and B chains of fibronectin, all promoted keratinocyte adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. To further define putative cell-binding domains within the 33/66-kD fibronectin fragments, we studied three chemically synthesized peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of the 33-kD fragment of the fibronectin A chain: FN-C/H-I (YEKPGSPPREVVPRPRPGV), FN-C/H-II (KNNQKSEPLIGRKKT), and CS1 (DELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST). Substrata coated with either FN-C/H-I or FN-C/H-II promoted keratinocyte adhesion in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, whereas peptide CS1 promoted no significant keratinocyte adhesion. In solution, both exogenous FN-C/H-I and FN-C/H-II partially inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to the 33/66-kD fibronectin fragments. Furthermore, antibodies prepared against these peptides also inhibited keratinocyte adhesion to the 33/66-kD fibronectin fragments. These data indicate that keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin is mediated by multiple distinct amino acid sequences, at least two of which are localized to the carboxy-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin.\r"

  ".W": "Solubilized interstitial collagens will form a fibrillar, gel-like lattice when brought to physiologic conditions. In the presence of human dermal fibroblasts the collagen lattice will contract. The rate of contraction can be determined by computer-assisted planemetry. The mechanisms involved in contraction are as yet unknown. Using this system it was found that the rate of contraction was markedly decreased when collagen lacking telopeptides was substituted for native collagen. Histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL) is a major stable trifunctional collagen cross-link in mature skin that involves a carboxyl terminal, telopeptide site 16c, the sixteenth amino acid residue from the carboxy terminal of the telopeptide region of alpha 1 (I) in type I collagen. Little, if any, HHL was present in native, purified, reconstituted, soluble collagen fibrils from 1% acetic acid-extracted 2-year-old bovine skin. In contrast, HHL cross-links were present (0.22 moles of cross-link per mole of collagen) in lattices of the same collagen contracted by fibroblasts. However, rat tail tendon does not contain HHL cross-links, and collagen lattices made of rat tail tendon collagen are capable of contraction. This suggests that telopeptide sites, and not mature HHL cross-links per se, are essential for fibroblasts to contract collagen lattices. Beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate (BAPN), a potent lathyrogen that perturbs collagen cross-linking by inhibition of lysyl oxidase, also inhibited the rate of lattice cell contraction in lattices composed of native collagen. However, the concentrations of BAPN that were necessary to inhibit the contraction of collagen lattices also inhibited fibroblast growth suggestive of cellular toxicity. In accordance with other studies, we found no inhibition of the rate of lattice contraction when fibronectin-depleted serum was used. Electron microscopy of contracted gels revealed typical collagen fibers with a characteristic axial periodicity. The data provide evidence that collagen telopeptide sites play a role in collagen gel lattice contraction.\r"

Quantitative studies were made of changes in the populations of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The progress of repair in the wounds covered with the semi-occlusive dressing showed a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) from 5 to 60 d, whereas the number of proliferative phase cells (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) increased from 5 to 7 d. The total cellularity per unit area showed an increase between 5 and 7 d, that is, during the proliferative phase of repair, and then progressively decreased as the proliferative phase was succeeded by the remodeling phase. In contrast, the repair process in the hydrocolloid-dressed wounds was more complex. The number of inflammatory cells remained relatively high throughout and there were consistently fewer endothelial cells present throughout. Fibroblast number showed an initial fall from 5 to 14 d but then started to increase in number from 21 to 60 d. This chronic inflammatory reaction appeared to be in response to particulate matter that had been incorporated into the wound bed and hypodermis, and was still apparent 6 months after injury, when hydrocolloid particles were detectable microscopically in the hypodermis.\r"

Melanocytes expressed mRNA for IL-8 and MCAF, when stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha, but not when stimulated with IL-6, IFN gamma, or LPS alone. IL-8 and MCAF could be induced in a dose-dependent fashion with doses as low as 0.1 ng/ml TNF alpha and 0.5 ng/ml IL-1 alpha. IL-8 and MCAF mRNA were rapidly expressed and peaked between 2 and 4 h for IL-8 and between 4 and 8 h for MCAF. This correlated well with the accumulation of IL-8 antigen as measured by a radioimmunoassay. Supernatants from melanocyte cultures stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha and separated on a heparin-Sepharose column became positive for neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. When IFN gamma was added to melanocyte cultures stimulated with suboptimal doses of TNF alpha there was a synergistic increase in secreted IL-8 protein and monocyte chemotactic activity. These data provide further evidence for the possible role of melanocytes in the initiation of an inflammatory reaction. Three different malignant melanoma cell lines stimulated with either TNF alpha or IL-1 alpha expressed IL-8 mRNA, but not mRNA for MCAF. The IL-8 mRNA signal corresponded well with the amount of secreted IL-8 protein. These data suggest that IL-8 and MCAF may play a role in growth regulation and spreading of melanomas.\r"

The superficial and deep layers of the temporalis fascia have been studied by light microscopy to assess any histological difference between the two. We have also assessed the physical characteristics of the different layers by measuring their Young's modulus in the wet and dry states. Anatomically the superficial layer is part of the epicranial aponeurosis and thus covers nearly the entire lateral aspect of the skull. The deep temporal fascial layer covers exactly the temporalis muscle and measures 10 x 12 cm. The fascial layers have a separate arterial and venous supply enabling them to be used as a homograft, a rotation flap or free microvascular flap. Histologically there is no difference between the two layers. A study of the physical characteristics of the two fascial layers using Young's modulus revealed no significant difference in elasticity between the two. The most significant factor affecting the elasticity was the state of hydration of the fascia.\r"

Of these 32 per cent had otalgia and 31 per cent reported episodes of aural discharge. Adequate audiometric data was available on 75 ears. Mean air-bone gaps were calculated using 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. Thirty per cent of ears had air-bone gaps of less than 10 dB and in 93 per cent the air-bone gap was less than 30 dB. Air-bone gaps of more than 40 dB were found in seven per cent. Of this group, seven patients were selected for surgical treatment. In all cases the retraction pockets were elevated and averted. In six cases, the thinned tympanic membrane was reinforced with a composite graft of cartilage and perichondrium. This technique has also been used in three patients not included in this study group. An ossiculoplasty was performed in four cases. In the early months, the retraction pockets remained completely everted. However, by 12 months some degree of retraction had recurred in four of the six patients who have been followed for more than 12 months.\r"

  ".W": "The results of ossiculoplasty are frequently reported in terms of closure of the air-bone gap. This parameter is a reliable indicator of the degree of technical success, and is useful in comparing different materials and types of reconstructions. However, assessment of the operated ear alone does not evaluate the effect of surgery on binaural hearing ability, leading to the situation where sub-optimal advice may be given to patients pre-operatively. This article advocates a more patient orientated method of assessing the results of ossiculoplasty. Previous studies have indicated that the operated ear must reach an air conduction level of 30 dB for the speech frequencies, or be within 15 dB of the other ear, to ensure that the patient will gain significant benefit. A graphical method for the prediction of patient benefit is presented, and compared to the rule of thumb quoted above. The implications for surgeons and patients considering ossiculoplasty are obvious. Many statements routinely made to patients prior to surgery for conductive hearing loss are unduly optimistic and unrelated to the realities of reported results. There is a need to determine what types of such hearing losses can be helped surgically, and more importantly to what extent the patients hearing disability can be relieved.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the fact that around 12 per cent of adult patients attending an audiology department will be severely hearing impaired (pure tone averages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz of 70 dB HL or worse in the better hearing ear), their clinical and audiometric characteristics have not been well documented. These characteristics were collected prospectively in 132 adult patients attending a Severe Impairment Clinic, set up to manage their specific problems. The inability to provide sufficient masking makes audiometric assessment of the severity of the impairment uncertain in the poorer hearing ear in 52 per cent of these patients. In addition, the limited bone conduction output makes it almost invariably impossible to assess the masked bone conduction thresholds and hence the air-bone gap in the poorer ear. Hence, accurate characterization is only practical of the better hearing ear in such patients. In 67 per cent of the better hearing ears, there was a mixed hearing impairment, the air-bone gap being 20 dB or greater. The aetiology of the conductive component was almost equally otosclerosis and chronic otitis media. In only 19 per cent was the impairment of a pure sensorineural type, broken down as 6 per cent congenitally acquired, 5 per cent due to meningitis and 9 per cent being adult in onset. In the remaining 14 per cent of patients the type of impairment could not be classified as the bone conductive thresholds were off scale. Having had experience of managing these patients at a special clinic and knowing the workload involved, it is argued that consideration be given to setting up such clinics in most departments.\r"

All ears were asymptomatic and no patient had evidence of middle ear effusion. Nasal packing following septal surgery is a frequent cause of short-lasting eustachian tube dysfunction but rarely severe enough to cause symptoms or middle ear effusion. Tubal dysfunction is most likely due to a combination of surgical oedema and a direct effect of the nasal packing.\r"

If despite intensive medical management, inadequate control of parathyroid hyperplasia continues surgical intervention becomes necessary. Ultra-sonography was performed pre-operatively in all 27 cases and detected 42 of 99 glands (42.5 per cent). Also scintigraphy was carried out in every patient but it gave a relatively low detection rate (24.5 per cent). Surgery was followed by improvement in 20 patients and progression of hyperparathyroidism in seven cases. Three of the seven patients failed to improve after subtotal parathyroidectomy, necessitating a re-intervention; the remaining four responded sufficiently to medical therapy. From our experience we conclude that subtotal parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions from 15 patients in continuous clinical remission from follicular lymphoma for longer than 10 years were examined for cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA). Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05). In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously. In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone. These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular lymphoma and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse.\r"

  ".U": "91341517\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed in 40 patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma treated in a prospective bladder-preserving program consisting of transurethral tumor resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine [MCV]), and 4,000 cGy radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin. Patients with biopsy-proven complete response after chemotherapy and 4,000 cGy radiation received full-dose radiotherapy (6,480 cGy) with cisplatin. Cystectomy was recommended to patients with residual disease. Distant metastasis rate was associated with tumor stage and size: 0% in T2 patients, 39% in T3-4 patients (P = .035), 6% for tumors less than 5 cm, and 59% for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm (P = .002). Risk of bladder tumor recurrence was higher in patients with tumor-associated carcinoma in situ (CIS; 40%) than those without CIS (6%; P = .075). Papillary tumors and solid tumors both had similar treatment outcomes. By multivariate analysis, tumor stage T2 (P = .04) and absence of CIS (P = .03) were significant predictors of complete response; CIS was predictive of local bladder recurrence (P = .07); and tumor size (P = .03), response after chemoradiotherapy (P = .02), and vascular invasion (P = .08) were associated with distant metastasis. Six of eight local bladder tumor recurrences were superficial tumors. The low actuarial distant metastasis rate of T2 patients (0% at 3 years), the 3-year actuarial overall survival rates for T2 (89%) and T3-4 (50%) patients, and the similar treatment outcomes for papillary versus solid tumors are encouraging when compared with published historical controls. These results provide preliminary evidence (median follow-up, 30 months) that the current chemoradiotherapy regimen may have beneficial effects in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. The true efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains to be proven by ongoing randomized trials.\r"

  ".W": "From December 1980 to January 1984, all patients with stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer in Denmark entered a randomized trial comparing surveillance only with radiotherapy after orchiectomy. One hundred fifty patients were assessable for the final analysis. Relapse occurred in 23 patients in the surveillance group and in 11 patients in the radiotherapy group. Radiotherapy completely prevented retroperitoneal relapse; 14 retroperitoneal relapses occurred in the surveillance-only group. All relapsing patients in the surveillance-only group are without evidence of disease with a median observation time after chemotherapy of 67 months. Two of the patients with relapse in the radiotherapy group died with disease; the others are alive without evidence of disease, with a median observation time after relapse treatment of 72 months. In the surveillance group, four relapses occurred later than 2 years after orchiectomy; only one such late relapse occurred in the radiotherapy group. Four of the retroperitoneal relapses occurred without concomitant increase in the serum marker levels (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] and human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]). It is concluded that surveillance only should replace radiotherapy after orchiectomy as standard treatment for clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Improved methods for control of retroperitoneal relapses, especially of embryonal carcinomas, are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with metastatic progressive germ cell carcinoma who failed to be cured with first-line cisplatin chemotherapy were treated with a salvage regimen consisting of cisplatin 20 mg/m2, etoposide 100 mg/m2, and ifosfamide 1.2 g/m2 (PEI) intravenously (IV), days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks. Ten patients (33%) were tumor-free at the end of therapy. Complete response (CR) was achieved with chemotherapy alone in four patients and with additional surgery in six patients (two necroses, two mature teratomas, two carcinomas). Six patients (20%) had normalization of tumor markers but unresectable residual disease (Rm-), and the remaining 14 patients (46%) failed to respond. Of 10 patients with CR, nine (90%) relapsed again (eight carcinomas, one mature teratoma). The median duration of CR was 3.5 months. The median survival of the whole group was 311 days (range, 110 to 996+). Currently, seven of 30 patients are alive, and five of them are without signs of progressive tumor. The response to prior cisplatin therapy predicted for response and survival after PEI salvage therapy. Of 14 patients with prior CR, eight (57%) achieved a second CR compared with one of 11 (9%) with prior unfavorable response (P = .039). The median survival for patients with prior favorable response was 400 days, compared with 251 days for patients with prior unfavorable response (P less than .001). Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, with leukopenia greater than grade 2 in 84% and thrombocytopenia greater than grade 2 in 51% of all cycles. This three-drug regimen can induce a second CR in one third of patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell carcinoma. Only those patients with prior favorable responses can expect to be cured by this salvage regimen, while patients with prior unfavorable response should be considered for alternative salvage approaches.\r"

Prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation was made by platelet transfusions and heparin. In case of leukemic resistance, patients received a second course with 2 days of rubidazone (arm A) or Amsa (arm B) and 3 days of Ara C. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received three consolidation courses with the two drugs used for induction and maintenance therapy for 3 years. Two patients in arm A and one in arm B were allografted in first CR. Initial characteristics were similar in both arms. In arm A, 18 patients (86%) reached CR, two had hypoplastic death, and one had leukemic resistance after two courses. In arm B, 12 patients (66%) achieved CR, two had early death (CNS bleeding, one case; ventricular fibrillation, one case), and four had resistant leukemia after two courses. The difference in CR rate between the two arms was not significant. In arm A, disease-free survival (DFS) showed a plateau at 54.3% after 34 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.1% to 74.9%), with eight CRs longer than 34 months. In arm B, DFS was significantly shorter (P less than .03), showing a plateau at 16.7% after 38 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7% to 44.6%), and only two prolonged CRs were seen. The difference in DFS remained significant after censoring allografted patients and patients who died in CR (one in arm A, two in arm B). Our results suggest that Amsa-Ara C combinations may be inferior to anthracycline-Ara C combinations in the treatment of APL, because they seem to provide shorter DFS and, possibly, a higher incidence of initial leukemic resistance. However, studies with larger numbers of patients are required.\r"

All patients had evidence of active disease, and the majority had advanced Rai stages. Of the 42 patients assessable for response, 22 (52%) achieved a partial response, five (12%) had stable disease, and 15 (36%) progressed. Thirteen of the 22 responders improved their Rai stages with fludarabine therapy, including six patients who achieved stage 0. Response rates for pretreatment stages III and IV were 60% and 53%, respectively. Patients with final Rai stages 0 to II had better survival than those with stages III and IV. Patients who had undergone splenectomy before starting therapy were more likely to respond. Myelosuppression was the primary toxicity and did not appear to be cumulative. Severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although infrequent, were associated with several deaths in the early cycles of treatment. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with no serious neurotoxicity noted. Infections were common with 22 minor, 18 major, and 10 fatal episodes. Fludarabine phosphate by this alternative dosing schedule is effective in refractory advanced CLL and is well tolerated by the majority of patients.\r"

High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been shown to be effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic leukemia. Therefore, we determined the long-term disease-free survival of patients who did not achieve a remission and were then treated with high-dose therapy and bone marrow allografting from matched sibling donors. Twenty-one patients (median age, 28 years) who did not achieve a remission with induction chemotherapy were subsequently treated with allogeneic BMT. After BMT, 90% achieved a complete remission. Six died of complications of the therapy, and six patients relapsed between 27 and 448 days after BMT. Nine patients (43%; median age, 25 years) are alive between 556 and 4,174 days after BMT. The cumulative probability of disease-free survival at 10 years is 43%. This study suggests that allogeneic BMT can be an effective therapy to achieve long-term control of acute leukemia, even in those patients who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy.\r"

Median survival of these patients, treated primarily with radiotherapy, is 13 months; 5-year survival is less than 5%. Thirty consecutive non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with primary CNS lymphoma were treated with barrier-dependent chemotherapy using intraarterial mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Follow-up included extensive neuropsychologic testing of all patients. Thirteen patients received cranial radiation 1 to 9 months before referral (group 1). Seventeen patients received initial BBB disruption chemotherapy with subsequent radiation only for tumor progression or recurrence (group 2). The difference in median survivals from diagnosis--17.8 months for group 1 and 44.5 months for group 2--was statistically significant (P = .039). Group 1 survival is comparable with the 20-month median survival of a historical series of patients (n = 208) treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Group 2 patient survival represents an advance in the survival of CNS lymphoma and was associated with preservation of cognitive function in six of seven nonirradiated complete responders observed for 1 to 7 years. Patient toxicity was manageable in this intensive therapeutic regimen. In this series, a plateau in survival curves suggests that a major portion of these patients may be cured without the neuropsychologic sequelae associated with cranial radiation.\r"

We determined the feasibility, immediate safety, and rapidity of response of patients to this regimen, as well as the relationship between prognostic factors and the rate of complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival. Therapy was well tolerated, and the major toxicity was hematopoietic. At the end of chemotherapy, 54 of 62 patients (87%) were in CR by clinical restaging, with a biopsy of residual disease where necessary. The actuarial 3-year EFS is 77% (SE, 11%), with a median follow-up of 35 months, and the survival is 91% (SE, 7%). With respect to EFS, female patients and those with stage II or III disease fared statistically better than males and patients with stage IV disease, respectively. Six patients have died: three of progressive Hodgkin's disease, one of secondary acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), one of secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and one of overwhelming bacterial sepsis. The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) is currently engaged in a randomized study of these eight cycles of chemotherapy with and without RT to assess the role of RT in achieving comparable results.\r"

  ".W": "To gauge the impact of intensified therapy on the survival of infants (younger than 1 year, n = 129) and children (greater than or equal to 1 year of age, n = 275) with neuroblastoma, we analyzed the results of eight successive clinical trials comparing various combinations of antineoplastic drugs, surgery, and radiotherapy. Changes in treatment did not affect the survival of children with involved noncontiguous lymph nodes or distant metastatic disease until the combination of cisplatin and teniposide (CDDP/VM26) was added to a basic regimen of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CTX/DOX). The resulting 4-year survival was 28% +/- 5% (SE) compared with 7% +/- 2% for previous treatments (P less than .001 by the log-rank test). The 4-year survival of infants with metastatic disease was improved by administering CTX/DOX to all patients, reserving CDDP/VM26 for those whose disease was resistant to the former combination: 82% +/- 6% versus 45% +/- 8% in earlier studies; P less than .001. In the subset of infants whose tumors had disseminated to bone or bone marrow at diagnosis, this therapeutic approach increased the probability of long-term survival from 48% +/- 10% to 85% +/- 9% (P = .01). The small group of children over 1 year of age with localized unresectable tumors also fared significantly better with the switch to CTX/DOX chemotherapy (4-year survival, 93% +/- 7% v 42% +/- 13%; P = .02). Multivariate analysis indicated that young age, limited-disease stage, nonadrenal primary site, and intensified treatment were independent predictors of a more favorable outcome. We conclude that substantial advances in the treatment of neuroblastoma have occurred over the past 25 years at this institution. The current overall 4-year survival probability of 57% +/- 4% compares favorably with estimates for most other common solid tumors of childhood.\r"

Three levels of nonmyeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide 4.5 to 5.25 g/m2, etoposide 750 to 1,200 mg/m2, and cisplatin 120 to 165 mg/m2 (CVP) were administered to patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients were randomized to ABM (n = 46) or no-ABM (NABM) (n = 46) infusion after CVP to study the impact of ABM on hematopoietic recovery, morbidity, and mortality. All patients had ABM harvested, underwent conventional chemotherapy, and then received CVP. Seventy-three patients received two courses of similar doses. The following were the median days to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.1 x 10(9)/L: for the ABM arm, 19, 21, and 19 and for the NABM arm, 23, 20, and 21 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, during course 1 (P = .01, .80, and .01, respectively). During course 2, ANCs to 0.1 x 10(9)/L and 0.5 x 10(9)/L were attained significantly faster at levels 1 and 3 in the ABM arm. ANC to 1.0 x 10(9)/L was comparable in both arms. Incidence of infection and duration of fever were similar in both arms. Although mortality and the incidence of delayed hematopoietic recovery were more frequent in the NABM arm, this was not statistically significant. Platelet recovery was consistently prolonged in course 2 in both arms, with demonstrable benefit of ABM in course 2 when dose levels were collectively considered. We conclude that (1) ABM enhanced recovery of ANC to 0.1 x 10(9)/L; (2) ABM did not decrease the incidence of infections and the duration of fever; and (3) CVP can be safely given without ABM to carefully selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the 2,531-patient Southwest Oncology Group extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (ENSCLC) data base from 1974 to 1988 to (1) assess the interactions of host- or tumor-related prognostic factors and therapy using Cox modeling and recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) to determine whether each independently predicts outcome, and (2) use RPA to define prognostic subsets with different survival potentials. Good performance status (PS), female sex, and age greater than or equal to 70 years were significant independent predictors in a Cox model applied to the entire population. In a second Cox model for patients with good PS enrolled on recent studies, hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium, and a single metastatic site were significant favorable factors. The use of cisplatin was an additional independent predictor of improved outcome in both Cox models after adjustments for year of accrual and all prognostic variables. The favorable effect of cisplatin was observed in each of six RPA-derived subgroups from the entire population. A second RPA of 904 patients from recent trials (nearly all received cisplatin-based therapy) resulted in three distinct prognostic subsets based on PS, age, hemoglobin, and LDH; greater than or equal to 1-year survivals were 27%, 16%, and 6% (P less than .0001). The best survival occurred for patients with a good PS who had a hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11 g/dL and who were older than 47 years. This analysis suggests that although several factors were independent variables in the Cox models, three important prognostic subgroups were easily defined through RPA. Together with other analyses, our results suggest the need to modify the stage IV category in NSCLC.\r"

Only previously untreated patients with SCLC were included; 46 and 48 patients receiving VP-16 and VM-26, respectively, are assessable for response. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to extent of disease, median age, and performance status (PS). The initial doses were for both compounds 70 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days every 3 weeks. After inclusion of 25 patients in the study, the doses were increased to 80 mg/m2 for VM-26 and 90 mg/m2 for VP-16 because of differences in toxicity. VM-26 caused more hematologic toxicity than VP-16 throughout the study. The overall responses (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) were 65% for VP-16 and 71% for VM-26, with CR occurring in 24% and 23%, respectively, for the two compounds. Median survival was 8.5 months for VP-16-treated patients versus 11.3 months for VM-26-treated patients (P = .58). It is concluded that both VP-16 and VM-26 are highly active single agents in SCLC.\r"

The dose intensity was increased by more frequent treatments rather than by increasing the dose size. The structure of this outpatient protocol includes weekly administration of chemotherapy, alternation of myelosuppressive and nonmyelosuppressive treatments, supportive corticosteroids, gastroprotective agents, and prophylactic antibiotics. Although the duration of chemotherapy was brief (9 to 12 weeks), the total cumulative doses of drugs delivered were similar to the standard regimen. Patients with no residual disease outside the chest after chemotherapy received thoracic irradiation, and patients with complete responses (CRs) received prophylactic cranial irradiation. Eligible extensive-stage SCLC patients were ambulatory, younger than 66 years of age, and free of brain metastasis. Forty-eight extensive-stage SCLC patients were treated. Forty-five (94%) responded to chemotherapy, with 19 (40%) attaining CR. After consolidative thoracic irradiation, the CR rate was 56%. The median time to progression was 43 weeks, and the median survival was 61 weeks. The 2-year survival rate was 30%. The most common site of first relapse was brain (38%). Although two patients (4%) died of toxicity, overall toxicity was acceptable for an outpatient regimen. We conclude that the CODE regimen reliably produces palliative remissions for selected extensive-stage SCLC patients, and it may be associated with durable remissions for some patients. The results of this pilot study are sufficiently promising to justify a phase III trial of CODE versus standard (alternating CAV and EP) chemotherapy.\r"

The series included 284 patients with limited disease (LD) and 328 patients with extensive disease (ED) managed between 1974 and 1986. Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate analysis and by the Cox multivariate regression model. Recursive partition and amalgamation algorithm (RECPAM), two clustering methods well suited for obtaining strata and adapted for censoring survival data, were developed and used in the formulation of a new prognostic staging system. In univariate analysis, prognosis was significantly influenced by extent of disease (DE), the number of metastatic sites, and the detection of mediastinal spread in LD. Poor performance status (PS), male sex, and advanced age were negatively correlated with survival, as were increased serum levels of alkaline phosphates (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), total WBC count (WBCC), and low platelet count and low serum sodium. The Cox model identified plasma LDH and mediastinal spread as the only significant factors in LD; the influence of PS, number of metastatic sites, bone metastasis, brain metastasis, and platelet count were identified as significant in ED. The RECPAM model identified four distinct risk groups defined in a classification tree by the following eight attributes: DE, PS, serum AP, serum LDH, mediastinal spread, sex, WBCC, and liver metastasis. The four groups were distinguished by median survival times of 59, 49, 35, and 24 weeks, respectively (P = .0001). Interactions among prognostic factors are emphasized in the RECPAM classification model as evidenced by reassignment of patients across conventional staging barriers into alternate prognostic groups. The advantages of using RECPAM over the more conventional Cox regression techniques for a new staging system are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of prognosis in node-negative breast carcinoma, we investigated 293 T2N0M0 patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection with a median follow-up of 19.8 years. The probability of surviving 20 years considering all causes of death was 41.3% +/- 3.0%. Recurrence-free survival (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 68.6% +/- 3% at 10 years and 63.2% +/- 3.1% at 20 years. The estimated probability of cure determined by the method of Brinkley and Haybittle was 63% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 55% to 72%). Prognosis was related to primary tumor size with the best separation (P = .06) when tumors from 2.1 to 3.0 cm (33% chance of recurrence at 20 years) and from 3.1 to 5.0 cm (44% chance of recurrence at 20 years) were compared. The histologic tumor type was prognostically important. Recurrence at 20 years was not significantly different for patients with invasive duct (34%) and lobular (42%) carcinoma. Women with special types (medullary, mucinous, papillary, etc) of carcinoma had a 25% chance of recurrence. Subsequent contralateral breast carcinoma was diagnosed in 29 patients, and four of these were fatal, accounting for only 4.6% of breast carcinoma deaths. Thirty-two patients (10.9%) developed a nonmammary malignant neoplasm (NMMN) after the ipsilateral breast carcinoma, and 69% of these lesions were fatal. Although the chances of recurrence at 20 years related to tumor size and type did not differ statistically in the series, there were trends that suggest that T2N0M0 patients can be stratified into recurrence risk groups based on tumor size and histologic type. These factors should be taken into consideration in the design and analysis of clinical adjuvant therapy trials. Measures for the early detection of common NMMNs should be included in the routine follow-up of T2N0M0 breast carcinoma patients.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal means of combining breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early-stage, node-positive breast cancer is not known. We reviewed the results in 295 patients treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy and affiliated institutions from 1976 to 1985. All patients had positive axillary nodes on dissection, had no gross residual disease in the breast or axilla after surgery, and received breast irradiation (with or without nodal irradiation) and three or more cycles of a cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF)-based or doxorubicin-containing regimen. Median follow-up in patients without any failure was 78 months. Breast failure rates were assessed in relation to the sequencing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The different sequences were not randomly assigned, and the characteristics of the sequence groups differed. The actuarial 5-year breast failure rate was 4% in 99 patients receiving radiotherapy before chemotherapy; 8% in 54 patients sequentially receiving some chemotherapy, then radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy, then further chemotherapy; and 6% in 116 patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the failure rate was 41% in 26 patients who received all chemotherapy before radiotherapy. The crude incidences of local failure within 4 years of treatment in these groups were 3%, 2%, 4%, and 15%, respectively (P = .065 for all four groups not being the same). The actuarial 5-year local failure rate was 5% for 252 patients irradiated within 16 weeks after surgery compared with 35% for 34 patients irradiated more than 16 weeks after surgery. The 4-year crude incidences were 4% and 12% for the two groups, respectively (P = .06). These results suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy may result in an increased likelihood of local failure. Formal randomized controlled trials will be needed to confirm these results and to improve the integration of these treatment modalities.\r"

Of the 49 patients, 33 were North African. The sex ratio was three males:one female, and the median World Health Organization (WHO) performance status was 1.6. In the 48 patients assessable for response, we observed nine (19%) complete responses (CRs) and 29 (60%) partial responses (PRs) (60%), for a 79% overall response rate (95% confidence interval, 68% to 90%) in the assessable group and a 78% global rate. There were eight CRs (24%) observed in the group without previous chemotherapy (33 patients) compared with one CR in the chemotherapy pretreated group (16 patients). Four patients are still alive without evidence of disease after 52+, 54+, 58+, and 58+ months, respectively. All of them had less than three bone MTS sites, and received radiation therapy in these sites. The results confirm the chemosensitivity of UCNT, and the observation of unmaintained long-term responders makes curability a possible consideration.\r"

Sequential dose escalation of each agent using taxol doses of 110 or 135 mg/m2 and cisplatin doses of 50 or 75 mg/m2 resulted in four dosage permutations that induced grades 3 and 4 neutropenia in 72% to 84% and 50% to 53% of courses, respectively. Neutropenia was brief, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 13% to 24% of courses. However, further escalation of taxol to 170 or 200 mg/m2 induced grade 4 neutropenia in 79% to 82% of courses. At the highest taxol-cisplatin dose level (200 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2), the mean neutrophil count nadir was 98/microL, and hospitalization for neutropenia and fever was required in 64% of courses. The sequence of cisplatin before taxol, which has less antitumor activity in vitro, induced more profound neutropenia than the alternate sequence. Pharmacologic studies indicated that this difference was probably due to 25% lower taxol clearance rates when cisplatin preceded taxol. Although neurotoxicity was initially thought to be a potentially serious effect of the combination, mild to modest neurotoxicity occurred in only 27% of patients. Adverse effects also included myalgias, alopecia, vomiting, diarrhea, bradycardia, and asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Objective responses were noted in melanoma, as well as non-small-cell lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck, colon, and pancreatic carcinomas. Based on these results, the sequence of taxol before cisplatin at doses of 135 and 75 mg/m2, respectively, is recommended for phase II/III trials, with escalation of taxol to 170 mg/m2 if treatment is well tolerated.\r"

Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined.\r"

This design combines an experimental protocol with a statistical application of ranking and selection theory. Its purpose was to identify (within a certain margin of error) a dose that achieved the highest rate of clinical response from a set of doses that were tolerable in terms of both acute (within 90 days) and late (more than 90 days) toxic effects (LE). We calculated the number of patients required to reliably test toxicity under various assumptions. To determine the maximum tolerated total dose for hyperfractionated radiation, we randomly assigned patients with tumors that responded to radiation therapy in a dose-dependent manner from four body sites (lung, upper respiratory and digestive tract, bladder, and brain) to one of three regimens receiving total doses (D1, D2, or D3) differing by increments of 4.8 Gy. All patients received two fractions of 1.2 Gy each (separated by 4-6 hours) daily 5 days a week. The lowest total dose was set at the level considered tolerable with standard once-a-day radiation therapy. We tested tumor responses and late toxic effects of higher doses by assigning patients to these three regimens until acute effects and early estimates of late effects were found to be acceptable for the highest dose D3; thereafter, regimen D1 was closed, and additional patients were assigned to D2, D3, and D4 (an escalated total dose greater than D3 by an increment of 4.8 Gy). The assignment of patients was performed in a weighted manner (1:1:2), so that greater numbers were assigned to the highest dose regimen (whether D3 or D4) to allow rapid evaluation of the feasibility of the highest dose.\r"

Follow-up on these patients was continued for an average of 15 years. Record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register for the period 1958-1985 identified 1543 cancers occurring 1 year or more after 131I treatment, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.11). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for cancers of the lung (SIR = 1.32; n = 105) and kidney (SIR = 1.39; n = 66). Among 10-year survivors, significantly elevated risks were seen for cancers of the stomach (SIR = 1.33; n = 58), kidney (SIR = 1.51; n = 37), and brain (SIR = 1.63; n = 30). Only the risk for stomach cancer, however, increased over time (P less than .05) and with increasing activity administered (P = not significant). The risk for malignant lymphoma was significantly below expectation (SIR = 0.53; n = 11). Overall cancer risk did not increase with administered 131I dose or with time since exposure. The absence of any increase in leukemia adds further support to the view that a radiation dose delivered gradually over time is less carcinogenic than the same total dose received over a short time. Only for stomach cancer was a possible radiogenic excess suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred eleven women with metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin (130 patients), 320 mg/m2 bisantrene (146 patients), or 14 mg/m2 mitoxantrone (135 patients). The doses were given intravenously every 3 weeks with a cross-over design to determine their relative efficacy and toxicity. To be eligible, patients must have had one previous chemotherapy regimen, and patients who were estrogen receptor positive must have failed endocrine therapy. There were 365 patients assessable for response and 399 assessable for toxic effects. The median age was 57 years; 18% were premenopausal or perimenopausal. Visceral dominant disease was present in 66% of the patients. Ninety-seven percent of the patients had a disease-free interval from diagnosis to first recurrence of less than 1 year. The response rate was 28% with doxorubicin, 13% with bisantrene, and 14% with mitoxantrone (P = .004). Median time to treatment failure was 133 days with doxorubicin, 66 days with bisantrene, and 68 days with mitoxantrone (logrank P = .06). The median survival was 315 days for doxorubicin, 290 days for bisantrene, and 177 days for mitoxantrone (logrank P = .04), although survival at 2 years was similar for all three agents. There were five responses in the 66 patients crossed over to doxorubicin and one response each for patients crossed over to bisantrene (39 patients) or mitoxantrone (63 patients). Toxicity leading to discontinuance of therapy was more common with doxorubicin, and discontinuance of therapy was due primarily to patient's request or cardiotoxicity. The major dose-limiting toxic effect for all three agents was leukopenia. Nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and alopecia were more severe with doxorubicin. Congestive heart failure developed in nine patients treated with doxorubicin, zero patients treated with bisantrene, and two patients treated with mitoxantrone. A decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction, as defined by moderate to severe Alexander grade changes, was more common in patients treated with doxorubicin (doxorubicin-treated patients = 20%, bisantrene-treated patients = 5%, and mitoxantrone-treated patients = 10%). This study demonstrates that bisantrene and mitoxantrone have only modest activity in metastatic breast carcinoma. The activity of doxorubicin is greater than that of the other two agents, but at a cost of increased toxicity.\r"

The frequencies of the allele were similar in 40 non-N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, 47 Wilms' tumors, and 31 other pediatric tumors. In these cases, the genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In 18 N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, however, the observed genotype frequencies deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P less than .005). Similar observations were made with an Sph I restriction fragment length polymorphism where the polymorphic site is located in intron 2. The differences between amplified and nonamplified neuroblastomas suggest a possible involvement of sequences at or near N-myc in the progression of tumors where the N-myc gene is amplified.\r"

The mean GSH contents during the sampling periods were low, varying from 1.94 to 3.27 nmol/mg protein between the subjects; the mean values for all samples were 2.54 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg protein. The GSH content varied markedly within the individual according to circadian stage (31.0% to 90.2%; mean, 51.4%). Between individuals the mean percentage of cells in DNA synthesis varied from 10.6% to 14.5%, but there was an intraindividual circadian stage-dependent variation, ranging from 48.9% to 274.0% (mean, 126.6%), relative to the lowest value. After adjustment for a slight phase difference between GSH content and DNA synthesis observed for some of the subjects, a statistically significant correlation was found between the GSH content and the fraction of cells in DNA synthesis. The myelosuppressive effect of many chemotherapeutic agents assumed to be detoxified by GSH-dependent mechanism(s) should be considered in the light of the low GSH content in human bone marrow, the circadian variation of DNA synthesis, and the circadian stage-dependent relationship of the GSH content and DNA synthesis.\r"

HL60/Vinc cells contain the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, whereas the HL60/Adr isolate does not. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) activity in drug resistance in HL60 cells. We utilized bafilomycin A1, an agent which selectively inhibits vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity at low concentrations. The results showed that bafilomycin A1 induced a major increase in drug accumulation and inhibited drug efflux in both HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells. Similar results were obtained with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa 1,3 diazole, an agent which is also capable of inhibiting vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Azide, an inhibitor of F1F0 mitochondrial ATPase, and vanadate and ouabain, which are inhibitors of E1E2-type ATPase, did not affect drug levels in resistant cells. We also observed that bafilomycin A1 did not compete with [3H]azidopine binding to P-glycoprotein. Thus, bafilomycin A1 does not appear to function as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. These results suggest an involvement of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity in the pathway of drug efflux from HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells. The mechanism of this action remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Deaths from uncontrollable hemorrhage might be prevented by arresting the circulation under protective hypothermia to allow resuscitative surgery to repair these injuries in a bloodless field. We have shown previously that in hemorrhagic shock, circulatory arrest of 60 minutes under deep hypothermia (tympanic membrane temperature, Ttm = 15 degrees C) was the maximum duration of arrest that allowed normal brain recovery. We hypothesize that profound cerebral hypothermia (Ttm less than 10 degrees C) could extend the duration of safe circulatory arrest. In pilot experiments, we found that the cardiopulmonary system did not tolerate arrest at a core (esophageal) temperature (Tes) of less than 10 degrees C. Twenty-two dogs underwent 30-minute hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg), rapid cooling by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood washout to a hematocrit of less than 10%, and circulatory arrest of 2 hours. In deep hypothermia group 1 (n = 10), Ttm was maintained at 15 degrees C during arrest. In profound hypothermia group 2 (n = 12), during cooling with CPB, the head was immersed in ice water, which decreased Ttm to 4 degrees-7 degrees C. The Tes was 10 degrees C in all dogs during arrest. Reperfusion and rewarming were by CPB for 2 hours. Controlled ventilation was to 24 hours, intensive care to 72 hours. In the 20 dogs that followed protocol, best neurologic deficit scores (0% = normal, 100% = brain death) at 24-72 hours were 23% +/- 19% in group 1 and 12% +/- 8% in group 2 (p = 0.15). Overall performance categories and histologic damage scores were significantly better in group 2 (p = 0.04 and p less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that profound cerebral hypothermia with CPB plus ice water immersion of the head can extend the brain's tolerance of therapeutic circulatory arrest beyond that achieved with deep hypothermia.\r"

This experimental study was done to determine whether circulating TNF plays a major role in the vasomotor collapse seen following experimental hemorrhage and blunt injury. Twenty anesthetized pigs were divided into two groups. Ten animals were bled 60% of their calculated blood volume in 15 minutes. Animals in Group IA (n = 5) had no treatment, and Group IB animals (n = 5) were given twice the shed volume as crystalloid 30 minutes after hemorrhage. The other animals, groups IIa and IIb (n = 5 each), were first subjected to a blunt injury to the thigh sufficient to cause a midshaft femur fracture, then bled and similarly treated. In both groups, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and serum TNF activity by L929 bioassay were measured at 15-minute intervals for 120 minutes after hemorrhage or hemorrhage and blunt injury. An additional three animals were infused with 4 x 10(8)/kg heat-killed E. coli to validate the TNF assay. All bled animals sustained a fall in MAP and CO to a mean of 33% of baseline values, with or without fracture. Group IB and IIB animals responded to fluid resuscitation by restoration of MAP and CO to 85%-97% of the baseline values. Tumor necrosis factor was not detectable before injury and remained undetectable in all these animals during the 120 minutes of the experiment despite hemorrhage alone or combined hemorrhage and blunt trauma, with or without fluid resuscitation. The test animals receiving the E. coli responded with markedly elevated TNF levels, which peaked at 90 minutes after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements in animals were made at various time-points following the administration of endotoxin, while studies in surgical patients were done in a group of healthy controls, in patients with \"early\" sepsis who had normal chest x-ray films, and in patients with radiographic and physiologic evidence of ARDS. In healthy control rats, net amounts of GLN are released by the lungs into the systemic circulation. This release rate doubled 30 minutes after intravenous endotoxin (1,580 +/- 320 nmol GLN/100 g BW/min vs. 736 +/- 179 in controls, p less than 0.01) but glutamine synthetase activity was unchanged, suggesting an outpouring of cellular glutamine stores. Two hours after endotoxin treatment, this accelerated fractional release of glutamine by the lungs was no longer detected. By the 12-hour time-point, the lungs reversed to an organ of net glutamine balance (234 +/- 248 nmol/100 g BW/min, p less than 0.05 vs. controls and ENDO30 min) despite a more than two-fold increase in glutamine synthetase activity (p less than 0.01). Simultaneously, lung weights were increased by 21% (p less than 0.01) and histologic examination showed an interstitial infiltrate and pulmonary edema. Similar observations were made in humans; patients with \"early\" sepsis exhibited a marked increase in lung glutamine release, while patients with ARDS demonstrated glutamine balance across the lungs (4,030 +/- 910 nmol GLN/kg BW/min vs. 637 +/- 496 in ARDS, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The results of 163 patients (49 SWs, 85 GSWs, 29 blunt trauma) who had resuscitative thoracotomy in the emergency room (ERT) were reviewed to reassess the indications for the procedure. The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) of the patients ranged from 0 to 3 in 138, 4 to 8 in 21, and greater than 8 in four. No patient with blunt trauma survived. Sixteen patients [12 (24.5%) with stab wounds and 4 (4.7%) with gunshot wounds] were eventually discharged, an overall survival of 9.8%. Eight of the survivors were without vital signs on arrival at the emergency center and one of them had only signs of life at the scene. Survival was best when the site of penetration was thoracic (n = 84) and the ERT was \"directed\" at potential cardiac injury. Fifty-six of these patients (66.6%) did have cardiac wounds with tamponade and 12 of them survived (21.4%). Two of the remaining 28 patients, both with pulmonary injury, were salvaged. This was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in patients with head and neck (n = 4), abdominal (n = 19), or multiple site (n = 40) injury when the ERT was nondirected. Two of the five patients (40%) with extremity vascular injuries survived after ERT was successful in restoring a cardiac rhythm. These data suggest that in patients without vital signs, ERT \"directed\" at potential cardiac injury based on thoracic penetration is an important prognostic prerequisite for survival. Emergency room thoracotomy is not beneficial in blunt trauma and its role in penetrating abdominal injuries remains unproven.\r"

Bacterial translocation induced by hypotension, endotoxemia, or burns is a reproducible phenomenon in the laboratory. The incidence of bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) in 29 critically ill patients was evaluated to determine its relationship to subsequent sepsis and MSOF. Bacterial translocation was documented in 3 of 4 patients who underwent laparotomy for gastrointestinal (GI) disease. No trauma patient (25 patients), even at second exploration 3-5 days after injury, had a positive MLN culture. Five patients died; 4 trauma patients, one with GI disease. Forty percent of the trauma patients had major complications, predominantly pulmonary infections with gram-negative bacteria. However, infectious complications and outcome were not related to MLN culture results. The classical progression of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream via the MLNs may require time and gut mucosal injury. The data suggest that bacterial translocation to the MLNs is not a common occurrence in acutely injured trauma patients.\r"

Thirty-four (23%) developed major septic complications (diffuse peritonitis, 21%; intraperitoneal abscesses 24%; and extraperitoneal abdominal abscesses, 56%). The septic complication rate was 26% in the bullet-present group compared with 16% in the remainder (p less than 0.15). The increased septic rate in those with bullets present was the result of abscesses developing around the retained missile. That group with missile abscesses had a lesser degree of injury as measured by the abdominal trauma index compared with the other patients with septic complications (p less than 0.001). Fifteen (79%) of the 19 patients with missile and missile track abscesses had them develop in the psoas muscle. These abscesses occur by fecal contamination of the muscle following inoculation by the bullet, which passes through the large bowel. Computed tomography-guided and operative drainage tend to fail if the foreign body is not removed. Computed tomography-guided or operative drainage should be successful in draining missile track abscesses when the bullet has exited the patient.\r"

In the past we hypothesized that late mortality is high, long-term outcome is poor, and return to independence is low in a severely injured geriatric population. Of 6,480 trauma admissions over 5 years, geriatric patients (n = 495) with blunt trauma injury (n = 421) and an ISS greater than 16 (n = 105) who survived until discharge (n = 61) underwent long-term follow-up (mean = 2.82 years). We surveyed 20 measures of functional ability; 10 measures of independence; availability and use of rehabilitation resources; employment history; alcohol use; support systems; and nursing home requirements. Of the 105 patients, 7 were subsequently lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 98, 44 (44.9%) died in hospital and 54 (55.1%) were discharged and interviewed. The mean age of the contacted patients was 72.6; their mean ISS was 23.3. Forty eight of 54 (88.9%) were alive at the time of interview, while 6/54 (11.1%) had died. Although only 8/48 patients regained their preinjury level of function, 32/48 (67%) returned to independent living. The 32 independent patients, those with \"acceptable\" outcome, were compared with an \"unacceptable\" outcome group composed of the 44 in-hospital deaths, the 6 late deaths, and the 16 dependent patients. Factors associated with poor outcome include a GCS score less than or equal to (p = 0.001), age greater than or equal to 75 (p = 0.004), shock upon admission (p = 0.014), presence of head injury (p = 0.03), and sepsis (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Technical feasibility and effectiveness were investigated in 8 miniature swine. The animals were divided into two groups: group A (n = 4), control animals; stellate liver lacerations without mesh wrap or other measures for hemostasis, and group B (n = 4); stellate liver laceration with synthetic absorbable mesh wrap applied for hepatic hemostasis. Except for mesh application, all variables were held constant for both groups. All animals in the control group died within 20 to 120 minutes (mean: 65 minutes). All animals in group B survived (p = 0.029). The livers were harvested for gross and microscopic examinations. No abscess, bile leak, or hematoma was noted. Clinically, total mesh wrapping was attempted in 6 patients with blunt exsanguinating liver injuries. The technique failed intraoperatively in two patients with juxtacaval lacerations and hepatic vein avulsion injuries. One patient with a bilobar gunshot wound died later of sepsis. In three patients with bursting injuries, the technique successfully controlled bleeding and resulted in long-term survival. In conclusion, the total hepatic mesh wrap (1) is geometrically, technically, and mechanically feasible, (2) was not associated with complications in this series, and (3) can effectively secure hemostasis following parenchymal liver injury.\r"

Of these, 213 were Hartford residents resulting in an annual age-specific pedestrian collision rate of 22.8 per 10,000 persons. A spot map of collision location reveals several well-defined geographic areas, which includes nearly half (45%) of the motor vehicle-pedestrian collisions. We reviewed 143 of 192 medical charts (75%) and 6 medical examiner records. The case fatality rate was 4.2% and the mean Injury Severity Score was 4.4. These findings will be useful for designing, implementing, and evaluating a targeted child pedestrian safety program.\r"

We used a commercially available TEB device to measure cardiac output in patients with thermodilution catheters in place. We compared the cardiac output measurements for the two modalities. We also compared the average hospital cost for initial cardiac assessment using the two techniques. The mean difference between the two cardiac output measurements was small (0.23 +/- 0.56) and not affected by the magnitude of the cardiac output readings. There was a strong correlation between COTD and COTEB (r = 0.91) and the regression slope was 0.91 with a Y intercept of 0.76. Cost analysis demonstrated that the use of TEB was approximately $600 less than thermodilution. Thoracic electrical bioimpedance measurement of cardiac output may offer a valuable alternative to the invasive measurement of the thermodilution catheter.\r"

These criteria for major trauma not only include the more severe and complex single injuries, but also include criteria for identifying combinations of injuries that require tertiary level care. Major trauma patients identified as tertiary using PMCs are compared with existing and frequently used measures of injury severity such as AIS and ISS. Analyses suggest that the Injury PMCs identify major trauma patients accurately and more specifically than other indicators of severity that are commonly used. In addition, unlike other measures that are generally limited to registries, PMC tertiary patient criteria differentiate major trauma patients at both trauma centers and non-trauma centers without additional data collection. Using this method thus facilitates trauma systems evaluation and patient outcome assessment.\r"

To investigate whether replacement of the antioxidant vitamins ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol can improve the PMN locomotory defect, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, or placebo was administered to a total of 46 victims of blunt trauma. PMN locomotion was quantitated using a micropore filter assay. Locomotion data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis with a split plot design and data for days 2-6 after injury were compared. Compared with placebo, the antioxidants improved PMN locomotion. The mean differences in distance migrated (treated minus placebo) were ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol = 11.3 +/- 3.0 microns (one-tailed p = 0.001) (mean +/- SE); ascorbic acid = 4.7 +/- 3.4 microns (p = 0.19); and alpha-tocopherol = 3.3 +/- 2.9 microns (p = 0.27). Although both antioxidants given together produced the best results, a plot of the 95% confidence intervals indicates that ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, either given alone, were also better than placebo. We conclude that antioxidant replacement therapy significantly improves the PMN locomotory abnormality in blunt trauma.\r"

Meta-analysis is a relatively new statistical tool whereby data from a number of clinical trials is analyzed and pooled to produce useful and more reliable data. In this study, a meta-analysis of 17 published randomized trials was performed to assess the effectiveness of single beta-lactam antimicrobials versus combinations containing aminoglycoside when used for penetrating abdominal trauma. The overall summary odds ratio of the pooled results of these trials was 0.96 (p = 0.833) with a 95% confidence interval of 0.30-3.05. Since not significantly different from unity (1.0), we conclude that single beta-lactam antimicrobials are as effective as traditional combinations containing aminoglycoside in this setting.\r"

However, its shortcomings include insensitivity in the early identification of isolated hollow viscus injuries. We have routinely assayed lavage amylase (LAM) and alkaline phosphatase (LAP) in acutely injured patients for more than 4 years to assess the contribution of lavage enzyme analysis to the overall accuracy of DPL. From 1,969 DPLs, LAM was analyzed in 1,881 (96%) and LAP in 1,734 (88%) of 1,536 blunt and 433 penetrating trauma cases. Of 28 patients with negative lavage by LRBC but LAM greater than or equal to 20 IU/L, 13 (46%) had clinically significant injury requiring laparotomy. Seventy-seven percent of these cases involved the small bowel. In this group, LAM greater than or equal to 20 IU/L had a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 75%, and positive predictive value of 46% for significant intra-abdominal injury. Seven patients had LAM greater than or equal to 20 IU/L and LAP greater than or equal to 3 IU/L. These values had a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 98%, and positive predictive value of 88% for significant abdominal injury. Elevations of LAM (greater than or equal to 20 IU/L) and LAP (greater than or equal to 3 IU/L) mandate laparotomy where the history is consistent with possible small bowel injury. Elevation of either enzyme alone should raise the suspicion of hollow visceral organ injury and warrant close observation.\r"

To stimulate mild hypovolemia, measurements were made with the subjects in a 60 degrees head-up tilt position. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and cardiac output (CO) were calculated from two-dimensional echocardiography. Flow through the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the origin of the hepatic veins was determined by the Doppler ultrasound technique. The application of counterpressure significantly increased LVEDV, CO, and arterial blood pressure over that seen with tilting without the device. These responses were accompanied by a small but significant increase in IVC flow. We therefore concluded that external leg counterpressure transferred blood to the central circulation by compression of the venous capacitance vessels (an autotransfusion effect) in mild hypovolemia, but such an effect may not benefit patients in a hypovolemic shock state because of the small amount of translocated blood.\r"

Fifty-four children (2.4%) had injury to the pelvic circle, as diagnosed by radiographic examination; 13 of these children had concomitant abdominal or genitourinary (GU) injury. Contingency table analysis and stepwise logistic regression were used to determine the best predictors of abdominal injury. The mean age of the children was 8.6 years. Eighty-nine percent of the injuries were motor-vehicle related (59% pedestrian; 30% crash occupant). Nine children (17%) required transfusions of packed red blood cells; 9 children (17%) required surgery. There were 6 deaths in this group, a mortality rate of 11.1%. The most common fracture sites in the pelvis were the pubic rami (59%), ilium or pelvic rim (17%), and the sacrum (6%). Ten children (19%) had multiple pelvic fractures. Location of fracture was strongly associated with the probability of abdominal injury: 80% of children with multiple pelvic fractures had concomitant abdominal or GU injury, compared with 33% with fracture of the ilium or pelvic rim, and 6% with isolated pubic fractures (p less than 0.001). The variables that best predicted abdominal or GU injury using a backward-elimination, stepwise logistic model were the presence of multiple pelvic fractures (p less than 0.002) and unweighted Revised Trauma Score (p less than 0.05); age of child, systolic blood pressure, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and mechanism of injury were not predictive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To measure the accuracy of iohexol clearance using a clinically simple 2-sample single injection technique, a comparison was made in 30 patients with classical continuous infusion techniques for plasma (y = 1.03x - 0.015, r = 0.981) and renal (y = 0.950x + 7.26, r = 0.964) iohexol clearance. A comparison was made with classical inulin clearance. The renal clearance of iohexol and inulin was virtually identical (y = 0.998x + 2.31, r = 0.986). Single injection iohexol clearance agreed closely with the renal inulin clearance (y = 0.947x + 4.92, r = 0.983) as did clearance based on a single 3-hour sample (y = 0.875x + 12.63, r = 0.962). Iohexol clearance using x-ray fluorescence is a simple, rapid and accurate alternative to inulin clearance for clinical and research purposes.\r"

  ".W": "The high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of microscopically visible, typically glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes for identification of the cause of glomerular bleeding have been recognized worldwide. Although glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes are simple to detect on phase contrast microscopy, immediate microscopic diagnosis still is indispensable, since a change in the morphology of the erythrocytes with restriction of the diagnostic relevance is anticipated because of the high autolytic potency of the urine. It may be postulated that this need for immediate diagnosis has led to the method being neglected owing to the high work load at hospitals and physician offices. Moreover, a physician who does not perform microscopic investigations or who lacks experience with the method will not be able to use this diagnostic technique, since it appeared to be impossible to transport urine samples by mail. In the context of a study comprising 30 patients, of whom 10 had histologically confirmed glomerulonephritis, we have shown that glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes have a manifest form stability for at least 3 days. The preservative used was thimerosal. Also, the urine can be investigated independent of time even after alcoholic Papanicolaou staining without an alteration of erythrocyte morphology. The practicality of the form stability of glomerular erythrocytes can be exploited in everyday medical routine. There are well founded prospects that the rate of early diagnosis of glomerulonephritis will increase.\r"

Consequently, surgical transposition of the left renal vein to achieve an unobstructed renal venous backflow was performed successfully in 2 patients, while 1 underwent nephrectomy. In 1 patient adjuvant ureteral instrumentation became necessary to aid occlusion of persisting shunts between peripelvic venous varicosities and the urinary tract.

The first 1,779 cases through December 31, 1988 have been thoroughly reviewed. The rate of outpatient ESWL has increased from 22% of the first 100 cases to more than 90% of the last 100. The cumulative over-all rate reached 70%. Currently, more than 95% of our cases are planned as same-day procedures.

In a retrospective analysis these 2 therapies were compared for treatment of solitary lower pole caliceal calculi to evaluate morbidity. During a 2-year period 23 patients treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 24 who underwent ESWL with the Siemens Lithostar were analyzed in regard to the success rate, effectiveness quotient, complication rate, length of hospitalization and disability period. Followup consisted of ultrasound and/or a plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively. A nephrotomogram was included in the ESWL group. Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 93.6% of the patients treated percutaneously without retreatment. In the ESWL group the success rate was 79.2% with a 41.6% retreatment rate. On the other hand, the ESWL group had a shorter hospitalization and an earlier return to normal physical activities. Among the patients who underwent a percutaneous operation 13% had complications compared to 4.1% in the ESWL group. The recurrence rate was higher in the former group (13% within a median of 18 months, compared to 8.3% within a median of 11 months in the ESWL group). The mean stone diameter was 1.42 cm. in the percutaneous group and 1.22 cm. in the ESWL group. Stone composition was similar in both groups. Since ESWL is an effective noninvasive procedure without the need for routine anesthesia and hospitalization, and with prompt return of the patient to a normal life it must be considered the method of choice for lower caliceal stones less than 2 cm. in diameter. However, percutaneous nephrolithotomy will continue to have a primary role in the management of larger stones.\r"

Each patient had persistent Proteus mirabilis bacteriuria before ESWL and received a standardized regimen of antimicrobial therapy in the perioperative period only. Of the 22 patients 19 (86%) were cured of the persistent bacteriuria. Of these 19 patients 16 had retained stone particles at the beginning of surveillance and 10 had retained particles at last followup. None of the particles produced symptoms or enlarged. However, 1 of the patients who was rendered stone-free had a P. mirabilis reinfection at 20 months and a new stone developed. Of the 22 patients 3 (14%) had continued persistent P. mirabilis bacteriuria after ESWL. Two patients were subsequently cured of the infection with antibiotics alone (1), and with antibiotics and extraction of a new ureteral stone (1). The remaining patient had expansion of retained stone particles after 51 months of surveillance. We conclude that a stone-free kidney is an unrealistic objective of ESWL monotherapy for struvite renal calculi. However, the treatment usually will eradicate the accompanying persistent bacteriuria and sterile stone particles will not enlarge during the first 2 to 4 years after treatment.\r"

A total of 25 ureteral calculi was treated after bypass with a ureteral catheter or stent and 13 after push back to the pelvicaliceal system. Shock wave requirement for fragmentation was significantly higher for calculi of 101 to 400 mm. X mm. when compared with the requirement for smaller calculi. Shock wave requirement was also significantly higher for patients with similar sized stones treated in the prone compared to the supine position. The average number of shock waves required for disintegration was not significantly different among in situ or any of the manipulation categories of similar sized stone populations. Over-all satisfactory clearance was achieved in 77.5% of the treated ureteral calculi. Clearance status was unaffected by size up to 400 mm. X mm. and the position of the patient during treatment (prone or supine). Clearance of ureteral stones treated in situ without prior manipulation (76.5%) was numerically inferior, although statistically insignificant, to that for successfully manipulated calculi (bypassed 88% and pushed back 92.3%) but it was significantly better than the outcome obtained after failed manipulation (46.2%). ESWL with the Lithostar device is a successful mode of treatment within the entire ureteral length, and a vigorous attempt at push back before lithotripsy is unnecessary.\r"

  ".W": "Early in our ureteroscopic experience, in an effort to facilitate retrieval of ureteral calculi with the 11.5F and 12.5F rigid ureteroscopes, the distal ureter was routinely balloon dilated to 24F. Among 131 ureteroscopic procedures all consecutive 108 distal ureteral calculi were successfully removed. However, only 65% of 23 upper ureteral calculi were extracted. A followup excretory urogram (6 weeks or later) in 86 patients revealed no distal ureteral strictures. A followup cystogram in 30 patients showed low grade vesicoureteral reflux in 20% of the patients and none of these individuals was symptomatic. As such, balloon dilation of the distal ureter to 24F appears to be well tolerated. Presently, given the advent of smaller ureteroscopes and lithotriptor probes, such extensive ureteral dilation is necessary only in a minority of patients with distal ureteral calculi. In these few patients with calculi resistant to lithotripsy balloon dilation of the ureter to 24F may allow for successful, safe stone extraction, thereby precluding open ureterolithotomy.\r"

  ".W": "A 3.3F electrohydraulic electrode (Wolf 2137.23) has been confined within a spring with a metal end cap, irrigated with water and covered with a 0.003-inch metal sheath (outside diameter 5F). The electrohydraulic lithotripsy discharge (Wolf Generator 2137.50) at E1 causes the metal cap to extend 3 mm. at 1,500 cm. per second and creates an impact pressure of 600 to 800 bar. Stone fragmentation efficiency of the electromechanical impactor was equivalent to unshielded electrohydraulic lithotripsy (gallstone 2.83 mg. per pulse, struvite/apatite 1.41 mg. per pulse, cystine 0.41 mg. per pulse, uric acid 1.48 mg. per pulse and 100% calcium oxalate monohydrate 0.10 mg. per pulse). Studies of the discharge of the electromechanical impactor within the pig ureter showed that minimal ureteral submucosal edema and hemorrhage occurred at 300 shocks discharged at a single point, and disruption of the mucosa and partial injury to the muscle layer occurred after 600 shocks given at the site of a pinched pig ureter. Pushing the electromechanical impactor perpendicular to the wall of the pig bladder will create a mechanical perforation within 35 shocks (electrohydraulic lithotripsy within 2 shocks). One patient had excellent fragmentation of a lower ureteral mixed monohydrate and dihydrate stone under direct vision performed with the electromechanical impactor passed via a 9.5F ureteroscope. There was no evidence of mucosal injury with 500 shocks. The electromechanical impactor has been developed to provide a safe and inexpensive method of ureteral stone fragmentation or disimpaction. These studies were performed to establish limits of safety that may allow use of the electromechanical impactor for stone fragmentation in the ureter without the need for ureteroscopy.\r"

At cutoff frequencies of 0.5 to 500 Hz. the duration was 8 to 18 seconds (mean 12.8 +/- 2.8, seconds, standard deviation), the amplitude was 250 to 750 microv. (mean 444 +/- 109 microv.) and the polyphasity was 8 to 22 (mean 13.8 +/- 3.3). With increasing tumescence and rigidity during audiovisual sexual stimulation, high frequency potentials of low amplitude and short duration were found in the normal patients. In impotent patients with an upper motor neuron or peripheral lesion specific types of potentials were observed. In 11 of 14 impotent patients with insulin-dependent diabetes for more than 20 years and with clinical findings of cavernous myopathy the potentials showed low amplitude, irregular shape and slow depolarizations. Abnormal findings of cavernous electrical activity were recorded in 51.6% of the consecutive impotent patients. Our clinical study suggests that single potential analysis of cavernous electrical activity may be useful in the diagnosis of cavernous autonomic neuropathy and cavernous smooth muscle myopathy.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 123 patients with complaints of erectile dysfunction and no clinically overt neurological disease underwent a comprehensive neuro-urophysiological diagnostic evaluation. The results were compared with those obtained in 50 healthy volunteers. Data gathered consisted of somatosensory evoked potentials from the posterior tibial nerve (tibial evoked potential) and from the dorsal penile nerve (pudendal evoked potential). Also, 2 sacral reflex latencies were measured (bulbocavernosus reflex and urethro-anal reflex). A total of 58 patients (47%) had at least 1 abnormal neuro-urophysiological measurement. Neuro-urophysiological abnormalities were found more frequently in older patients. The tibial evoked potential was abnormal in 30 patients (24%), pudendal evoked potential in 21 (17%), bulbocavernosus reflex in 26 (21%) and urethro-anal reflex in 32 (26%). It was concluded that somatosensory disturbances constitute an important part of neuro-urophysiological abnormalities. Our results suggest a relationship between erectile dysfunction and subclinical, age-related (penile) sensory disorders. Our study corroborates the importance of penile sensibility for erectile (patho)physiology as suggested by others and supports the concept of sensory deficit impotence as an important cause of erectile dysfunction.\r"

In patients who continue to use prostaglandin E1 the median duration of drug use is 7 months, with a range of 2 to 28 months. There have been no instances of cavernous fibrosis, systemic reaction or chemical priapism (erection present longer than 4 hours) in any patient. Only 8 men (11%) were unable to achieve an adequate erection with prostaglandin E1 injections. The most common adverse effect of prostaglandin E1 was penile pain after injection. The incidence of severe pain leading to drug discontinuation was 17% (12 of 72 patients) while mild to moderate pain occurred in 22% (16 of 72). Over-all, intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections appear to be a safe, effective treatment for impotence in most men.\r"

Moreover, potassium citrate decreased urinary saturation of calcium oxalate and uric acid, although it slightly increased that of brushite. However, there was no significant difference in these measures when the drug was given with meals from the time when it was given on an empty stomach. Thus, the effect of potassium citrate on urinary risk factors is unaffected by food.\r"

Tamm-Horsfall protein, a renal glycoprotein excreted in urine, may constitute a natural defense mechanism against ascending urinary tract infection by binding mannose-sensitive fimbriated microorganisms. We hypothesized that the quantity of Tamm-Horsfall protein excreted is decreased in the elderly. Native aggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein was measured in urine samples from 24 young women (group 1, mean age 33 years) and 47 female nursing home patients (group 2, mean age 84 years) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. Another 16 elderly women (group 3, mean age 85 years) had active urinary tract infection. The aggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein was then disaggregated by dilution and quantified. Significant differences in mean urinary disaggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein concentrations were found between groups 1 (64.22 mg./l.) and 2 (35.07 mg./l.), and between groups 1 and 3 (34.71 mg./l.), respectively. In contrast, mean aggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein levels were significantly higher in group 2 (1.56 mg./l.) than in group 1 (0.92 mg./l.) or group 3 (0.97 mg./l.). Our studies show that urinary disaggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein concentration is decreased in the elderly, and that aggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein is increased compared to younger adults. The aggregated Tamm-Horsfall protein concentration is decreased in the elderly during episodes of urinary tract infection.\r"

This instrument is the smallest caliber of all ureteronephroscopes available to date. Because of the small diameter the device can be inserted into the ureter cystoscopically in a manner similar to catheter insertion. The procedure is done with the patient under local anesthesia. We performed ureteronephroscopic procedures on 79 patients using mainly a 6F passively deflecting flexible ureteronephroscope, which consists of the aforementioned 2F video image flexible ureteronephroscope and a 3F working channel. The area to be viewed was accessed successfully in 41 of 43 patients (95%). Over-all, diagnostic maneuvers were successful in 64 of 79 patients (87%). We suggest that the 2F and 6F flexible ureteronephroscopes would be indicated when conclusive diagnosis for upper urinary disease is not obtained by other means.\r"

In patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck contracture the bladder neck did not open well. Urethral stricture was associated with a marked opening of the bladder neck and posterior urethra. In patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia an involuntary contraction of the external sphincter was observed.

Interestingly, a trisomy 21 patient has been reported with agonadism. We suggest that genes on chromosome 21 may have some role in gonadal development.\r"

Traditionally, electrocoagulation has been the method used for epilation when intraluminal hair has become a problem, such as interfering with flow, as a focus for recurrent urinary tract infection or acting as a nidus for calculus formation. Electrocautery also is performed during grafting in an attempt to prevent the growth of hair when hair-bearing skin is used. Unfortunately, due to lack of penetration the hair follicles are not destroyed and the epilating procedure fails or is only partially successful. The neodymium:YAG surgical laser can photocoagulate tissue to a depth up to 5.0 mm, and thus, has the ability to destroy hair follicles. We report 4 cases presenting with clinical problems directly related to hair-bearing urethral grafts successfully treated by neodymium:YAG laser epilation.\r"

Biopsy of a hepatic metastasis in 2 patients confirmed anaplastic carcinoma of the carcinoembryonic antigen-producing cell type. Immunohistochemical staining of a lymph node metastasis identified the PSA-producing cell type only. Such results suggest selective metastatic spread of each cell type to its own organ tropic site. Occasional carcinoembryonic antigen-producing prostate cancers may metastasize to the liver. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurements occasionally may be useful in the management of certain prostate adenocarcinoma patients.\r"

Additionally, the degree of venous outflow obstruction was assessed by saline perfusion of the cavernous body during aortic occlusion. Detumescence had three distinct phases: an initial phase exhibiting a small pressure increase; a second phase showing a slow pressure decrease; and a third phase in which a fast decrease occurred. The first phase was abolished by aortic clamping, whereas the other phases were not significantly affected. Sympathetic stimulation abolished or prevented the second phase. Perfusion of the cavernous body during the second phase resulted in a pressure rise to off-scale values; however, when initiated during the terminal phase or in the nonstimulated penis, the pressure increase was slight. Our study indicates that the arterial flow rate influences the duration of the first phase of detumescence and that venous drainage is completely restored in the third phase. Furthermore, sympathetic stimulation causes an almost immediate full restoration of venous drainage, as cavernous perfusion initiated with an intracavernous pressure about twice as high as without sympathetic stimulation failed to increase pressure to off-scale values.\r"

Image analysis morphometry was performed on the histological sections to determine the epithelial content of the gland. Our results indicate that there is a vast heterogeneity of receptor expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Expression of ARc ranged from zero to 1312 fmol/gm. tissue (mean +/- SD 265 +/- 290), ARn ranged from zero to 531 fmol/gm. tissue (mean +/- SD 145 +/- 98) and EGFR ranged from zero to 316 fmol/gm. tissue (mean +/- SD 121 +/- 76). A statistically significant association was found between expression of ARn and EGFR, and these were both significantly correlated with the epithelial content of the gland.\r"

Specific binding of [3H]bunazosin was saturable, reversible, and of high affinity (Kd = 0.55 +/- 0.04 nM). The density of [3H]bunazosin binding sites (Bmax) was 676 +/- 33 fmol/mg. protein. [3H]Bunazosin rapidly associated with its binding sites in membranes of human prostates and reached steady state by 20 min. at 25C. The rate constants for association and dissociation of [3H]bunazosin binding were calculated to be 0.11 +/- 0.01/nM/min. and 0.05 +/- 0.02/min. (n = 4), respectively. Seven alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists competed with [3H]bunazosin for the binding sites in the rank order: R-(-)-YM-12617 greater than prazosin greater than SGB-1534 greater than bunazosin greater than terazosin greater than naftopidil greater than urapidil. In parallel studies with [3H]bunazosin, the Kd and Bmax values for [3H]prazosin binding in human prostates were slightly lower. There was a similarity in the potency and rank order of seven alpha 1, adrenoceptor antagonists for the inhibition of [3H] bunazosin and [3H]prazosin binding in human prostates. The new [3H]bunazosin binding assay in human prostates is remarkable for its low degree of nonspecific binding as compared to [3H]prazosin, especially at high ligand concentrations. Thus, [3H]bunazosin may become a useful radioligand for the further analysis of the alph 1 adrenoceptor binding sites in human prostates.\r"

[125I]-HEAT was used as radioligand for autoradiography. Autoradiographic distribution of alpha 1-adrenoceptor was quantitated by grain counting using a light microscope equipped with a micrometer. Specific binding was demonstrated predominantly in fibromuscular stroma of PZ, fibromuscular stroma of CZ and preprostatic sphincter. No specific binding was demonstrated in glandular epithelium of PZ and periurethral gland. Glandular epithelium of CZ showed a few specific bindings. Among fibromuscular portion, specific bindings in both CZ and preprostatic sphincter were significantly higher than in PZ. Specific binding in glandular epithelium of CZ was significantly less than in fibromuscular stroma of PZ. These results show that the human prostate has a zonal difference in the distribution of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, probably reflecting some functional difference in these regions.\r"

In the aged bladders the contractile strength and contractile speed responding to CaCl2 were significantly less compared to the young. On the other hand, the muscle contraction of the three groups following depolarization of the cell membrane by adding KCl and BaCl2 did not differ significantly. The change in muscle relaxation responding to MgCl2 was also insignificant. These results suggest that although contractile and relaxation mechanisms of the detrusor muscle per se are not affected by an aging process, the contractile ability which is related to calcium ion is impaired in the aged rats. It is likely that decreased membrane permeability to calcium ions and/or the change in the intracellular contractile mechanisms related to calcium ions may account for the decreased muscle contractility in the aged rats.\r"

In Experiment 1, the copulatory behavior and reflexive erections of male rats were studied before and after the CN were transected bilaterally (n = 8), unilaterally (n = 6), or sham-operated (n = 6). In postoperative tests, bilaterally operated males were severely impaired in their attempts to effect intromission, and they had the expected deficits in reflexive erections of the penile body, but their capacity for erection of the glans penis was only minimally impaired. Sham-operated males were unaffected by surgery, and unilaterally transected males had intermediate values. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that activity of the bulbospongiosus muscles was responsible for the residual erectile capacity of the glans after CN transection in Experiment 1. Males had bilateral sections of the CN (n = 9), or of the nerves innervating the bulbospongiosus muscles (n = 10), or of both of these nerves (n = 8), or sham surgery (n = 10). Relative to CN transection alone, the combined denervation further reduced glans penis erections, but did not eliminate them. These results suggest that the cavernous nerves of the rat are not the only peripheral nerves facilitating vascular engorgement of the corpus spongiosum.\r"

  ".W": "Ureteral walls were obtained from twelve autopsies without urological diseases and from surgical material of twelve patients operated for congenital hydronephrosis. The specimens were submitted to computer-assisted analysis of 3-D muscular architecture at the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ). Serial histologic sections in parallel with the wall were prepared. A geometric model was introduced to simplify the muscular layer, replacing bundles with vectors of corresponding size and direction. The vector distribution visualized that normally, the ureteral muscles change their arrangement with age, from a circular pattern in neonates to an oblique mesh in adults. In addition, longitudinal muscles emerged at the age of two years in the subepithelial layer. In patients with congenital hydronephrosis, not only were such growth-related changes ambiguous or lacking, but there also were various abnormalities; segmental muscular hypoplasia, disarrangement of bundles or lack of longitudinal fibers. These were considered to closely correlate with the urinary obstruction in patients with this disease.\r"

This was accomplished by embedding dispersed xenograft cells in 0.1 by 5.0 cm. spaghetti-like strands of Basement Membrane MATRIGEL [BMM (Collaborative Research, Inc.)], a unique technique facilitating the transition to tissue culture. Now passed over 30 times, the cells display anchorage and serum concentration independent growth with a doubling time of 22 to 24 hours. Cells exhibit pronounced morphological differences when grown on BMM coated culture dishes, assuming a pseudoglandular configuration, in contrast to typical homogeneous monolayer growth on plastic culture dishes. Light and electron microscopy show cohesive sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells, consistent with prostate carcinoma. Karyotypic analysis revealed all human chromosomes, near tetraploidy, 10 to 12 markers, and 3 to 4 X chromosomes, without a Y chromosome. Cells injected s.c. or embedded in BMM and implanted in the subrenal capsule space are equally tumorigenic in male and female athymic mice, suggesting that DuPro-1 cells are hormonally insensitive. Embedding cells in BMM may be useful in developing other tissue culture cell lines from neoplasms difficult to initiate in vitro. DuPro-1 should provide a valuable means to study the biology, immunology, and chemosensitivity of human prostate cancer.\r"

To determine the actual incidence of alcohol-impaired drivers on U.S. roads, a national roadside survey using portable breath-testing devices was carried out in 32 localities in the spring of 1986. The same sampling design and survey procedures used in a 1973 national roadside survey were followed as much as possible. The 1986 survey found 3.1% of the late-night weekend drivers to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10% or more, compared to 4.9% of drivers in 1973. Similarly, 8.3% of the 1986 drivers were at or above 0.05% BAC, compared to 13.5% in 1973. The data indicate that the incidence of alcohol-impaired driving on weekend nights has fallen by one-third or more in the United States since 1973 and that the decline affected most population subgroups.\r"

  ".W": "The relative risks of fatal crash involvement at various blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were examined using data on fatal driver injuries from the Fatal Accident Reporting System in conjunction with driver exposure data from the second national road-side breath-testing survey. Based on driver fatalities in single-vehicle crashes, it was estimated that each 0.02 percentage increase in the BAC of a driver with non-zero BAC nearly doubles the risk of being in a fatal crash. Crash risk was found to increase with increasing BAC among all of the six age and sex groups studied. At BACs in the 0.05-0.09 percent range, the likelihood of a crash was at least nine times greater than at zero BAC for all age groups. Younger drivers with BACs in the 0.05-0.09 range had higher relative risks than older drivers, and females had higher relative risks than males. At very high BACs (at or above 0.15 percent), the risk of crashing was 300 to 600 times the risk at zero or near-zero BACs. These relative risk estimates are considerably higher than estimated in other studies, but other studies have based their estimates on all crashes rather than single-vehicle crashes only. In this study, relative risks were also lower when based on driver fatalities in all crashes. However, when plausible assumptions were made about the BAC distributions of other participants in multiple-vehicle crashes (whose actual BAC is often unknown), the relative risks based on the maximum BAC of the crash participants were nearly as high as those estimated in single-vehicle crashes.\r"

  ".W": "Breath alcohol measurements for forensic purposes are typically not made at the time of a driving incident but at some later time. Therefore, the magnitude of variation in breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) following the time of arrest is of concern. The use of roadside preliminary breath test (PBT) instruments can provide data on BrAC closer to the time of a driving incident and allow for comparison with later evidential analysis. This retrospective study evaluates two distributions (N = 968): differences between PBT results and the first evidential breath test (PBT-BrAC1) and differences between two (duplicate) evidential breath alcohol tests (BrAC1-BrAC2). The two distributions were shown to vary from each other and from the normal with statistical significance (p less than .05). The PBT-BrAC1 distribution had greater variability (SD = .025) than the BrAC1-BrAC2 distribution (SD = .010). An important result was that the PBT was equal to (within duplicate sampling variability) or greater than BrAC1 in approximately 85.5% of the cases. The remaining 14.5% could not be explained by sampling variability within the duplicate test distribution. The variability in both distributions typically exceeds the normally accepted alcohol elimination rates. The conclusion is that differences between roadside and subsequent evidential breath results cannot be attributed solely to absorption or elimination kinetics. Intra-individual breath sample differences can be large and thus obscure the accurate evaluation of absorption and elimination rates. Breath tests conducted within approximately 2 hours of driving will reflect, within experimental uncertainty, the BrAC at the time of driving.\r"

The second group of 76 was composed of a random sample, matched by age and ethnicity who had completed the 5-day program following a DWI but had not been re-arrested. The third group was a control group of 76, matched by age and ethnicity, but with no record of DWI, who were randomly selected from the same military units as the initial two groups. Soldiers with one DWI had significantly more arrests than did soldiers in the control group; soldiers with two DWI arrests had significantly more arrests than either of the other groups. The data indicate that soldiers apprehended for DWI are more likely than non-arrestees to be arrested for a wide variety of antisocial behaviors.\r"

Female alcoholics used alcohol to alter their mood more than did the alcoholic men, whereas women in the control group used it less for this purpose than did the male controls. The second interaction effect indicated that female alcoholics drank in response to marital difficulties much more than did male alcoholics.

Assessment instruments for the sons included the Personality Inventory for Children, High School Personality Questionnaire, Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Comparable questionnaires were administered to the fathers: the MMPI, 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. No psychopathology or extreme personality variants were observed in either fathers' or sons' groups. However, MANOVAS and linear discriminant functions revealed significant differences on several personality measures between fathers' and sons' groups. Compared to sons of nonalcoholics, sons of alcoholics were relatively more compulsive, insecure and fearful while being more subdued and detached. The recovering alcoholics were more impulsive and regimented than the nonalcoholics. An index resulting from the combination of the best personality discriminators was significantly correlated in father-son pairs. In addition, this index was significantly correlated with key neurocognitive variables from our previous study which assessed the same father-son pairs. This atypical CNS profile, encompassing altered electrophysiology, neuropsychological performance and personality traits, may be useful in identifying those at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\r"

Using both factor analysis and Rasch analysis, two versions of a \"Steps Questionnaire\" were developed. A 96-member subset of the original subject pool was assessed quarterly for 1 year following inpatient treatment to determine the predictive validity of the questionnaire. The results of this study suggested that agreement with AA's first three steps can be measured and that agreement with AA's first step correlates with number of sober days posttreatment. The dichotomization of Steps Questionnaire scores into total agreement versus partial agreement with Step 1, and from this the reduction of uncertainty in the prediction of abstention over a lengthy follow-up period, provides support for AA's contention that total surrender to one's powerlessness over alcohol is part of the process of achieving abstention.\r"

In this study, changes in cirrhosis death rates in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia between 1974 and 1983 were regressed onto changes in per capita consumption (1974-83). AA membership (1974-83) and alcoholism treatment (1979-82). No significant relationship between treatment and cirrhosis changes was observed; however, the measure of change in treatment may not reflect the full extent of changes that occurred in the 1974-83 period. As predicted, decreases in per capita consumption and increases in AA membership were significantly associated with decreases in cirrhosis rates.\r"

MM subjects achieved remission significantly sooner than BM subjects, and the difference in the Kaplan-Meier remission curves was most striking in the first 30 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.012). The patterns of compliance with toileting in the treatment groups were almost identical, although about 1 in 8 children overall did not comply with the sitting programme. After exclusion of the 24 poor compliers, there was no significant difference between BM and MM groups.

  ".W": "Some insulin-dependent diabetic patients who have clear symptoms of hypoglycaemia during animal insulin treatment have reported loss of these symptoms when human insulin preparations are introduced. A survey of Mersey Region, UK, identified eleven patients whose awareness of hypoglycaemia was lost after introduction of human insulin but returned with animal insulin treatment; seven took part in the study. Acute hypoglycaemia was induced in these patients on two occasions by intravenous infusion of porcine or human soluble insulin (2.5 mU.kg-1, min-1) in random order. There was no significant difference between porcine and soluble insulin in the plasma glucose profile; mean (SEM) plasma glucose fell from 7.1 (0.4) mmol/l to a nadir of 1.5 (0.1) mmol/l with porcine insulin and from 7.1 (0.5) mmol/l to 1.6 (0.2) mmol/l with human insulin. An acute autonomic reaction occurred in all seven patients, at a similar plasma glucose concentration (1.9 [0.1] mmol/l with porcine insulin; 2.0 [0.2] mmol/l with human insulin). There were no significant differences in the frequency of symptoms or signs of hypoglycaemia between the two insulin species, nor any consistent differences in plasma glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, adrenaline, or noradrenaline responses to hypoglycaemia. Symptomatic and hormonal responses to acute hypoglycaemia induced by porcine and human soluble insulins therefore seem to be almost indistinguishable, even in patients carefully selected for their apparent loss of hypoglycaemia awareness with human insulin.\r"

In 7 of these patients pulmonary artery pressure changes before death were consistent with acute obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed. Platelet aggregates were not strikingly increased in blood vessels in other tissues. No single obvious cause for these unusual histological findings could be identified, although the presence of intravascular catheters, perioperative blood and platelet concentrate transfusions, and cellular debris from the liver forced into the circulation during surgery might predispose to platelet aggregation.\r"

Long-term follow-up studies suggest a higher frequency of secondary tumours, especially leukaemias, among women receiving such cytotoxic drugs. We studied the frequency of new primary malignancies in 1113 patients with early breast cancer who had been included in a randomised trial to compare chemotherapy as an adjunct to primary surgery with adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy. The estimated rate of new primary malignancies at ten years was significantly lower (p less than 0.0003) in the chemotherapy group (1%) than in the radiotherapy group (6%). The corresponding rate among 1986 patients treated with surgery alone was 5%. Our findings suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer may protect against the development of new primary tumours in the first ten years of follow-up.\r"

Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.\r"

All patients had normal thyroid function before treatment. In 2 patients with pre-existing thyroid antibodies, thyroid dysfunction developed but disappeared after cessation of GM-CSF. No other autoimmune abnormalities appeared. Stimulation of antigen-presenting cells by GM-CSF may bring about this phenomenon.\r"

In contrast, only 2 (1.5%) of 135 patients attending a public endoscopy clinic and 1 (1%) of 88 patients attending a private endoscopy clinic were seropositive. 1 (1%) of 98 pregnant women living in a Lima shanty town was EITB-positive. 15 (58%) of 26 neurology patients diagnosed clinically as having cysticercosis were seronegative. Routine screening by EITB of all patients with neurological symptoms from areas of endemic cysticercosis would avoid misdiagnosis of this common and treatable disease.\r"

The point mutation K329E is thought to be the commonest mutation causing MCAD deficiency in caucasian patients. The prevalence of this mutation was determined by use of dried blood spots on Guthrie cards obtained during neonatal screening programmes. 12 carriers were identified among 479 newborn babies in Britain, 5 among 353 in Australia, and 5 among 536 in North America but none among 500 in Japan. Since presymptomatic diagnosis and appropriate dietary management can prevent life-threatening episodes in MCAD deficiency, population-based DNA screening for this potentially fatal disorder might be justified in countries with a high frequency of this mutation.\r"

The exceptional increase in the number of cases of meningococcal infection 2 weeks after an influenza A outbreak in England and Wales during November and December, 1989, provided an opportunity to investigate the relation between the two events. Patients with meningococcal disease in December, 1989, were more likely than age-matched controls to show serological evidence of recent influenza A infection (odds ratio 3.9, 95% Cl 1.2-13.9). The most likely explanation for the association is immune suppression induced by influenza A, though a lowering of mucosal resistance to meningococcal invasion may also be a factor. Public health authorities should be aware of the association and should be prepared to alert medical practitioners and the public to the increased risk of meningococcal disease when influenza A outbreaks occur.\r"

  ".W": "There is now substantive evidence that the provision of exogenous carbohydrate at high rates (1-2 g. min-1) can enhance performance during prolonged exercise. This finding has revived research into the factors determining the rate of exogenous carbohydrate delivery during exercise. While the rate of muscle oxidation of exogenous carbohydrate could be determined by the rate of gastric emptying or of intestinal carbohydrate absorption or of muscle glucose uptake and oxidation, most physiologists seem to have assumed that gastric emptying is the factor that limits the rate of exogenous carbohydrate delivery during exercise. Furthermore, studies of gastric emptying have suggested that the carbohydrate content of the ingested solution is an important factor determining its rate of gastric emptying. However, the findings of recent studies employing a repeated drinking design suggest that the gastric volume and therefore the pattern of drinking during exercise will have a significant, possibly major, influence on the rate of both carbohydrate and water delivery from any solution. This review considers this evidence and its practical implications for athletes who wish to ingest carbohydrate during exercise and for exercise physiologists designing studies to optimize carbohydrate delivery to muscle during exercise. It is proposed that, if gastric volume is an important determinant of the rate of gastric emptying, a more standardized method for reporting the rates of gastric emptying of different solutions should be adopted.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used, but there is uncertainty about their relative merits. METHODS. We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated large-volume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt. Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during follow-up were treated with paracentesis, and those in the peritoneovenous-shunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction. RESULTS. During the first hospitalization, ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The mean (+/- SD) duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 9 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died. During follow-up, 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again. In the paracentesis group, the number of rehospitalizations for any reason (174 vs. 97 in the peritoneovenous-shunt group) or for ascites (125 vs. 38) was significantly higher, and the median time to a first readmission for any reason (1 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 2 months) or for ascites (2 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 17 months) was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The total times in the hospital during follow-up, however, were similar in the two groups (48 +/- 49 and 44 +/- 39 days, respectively). Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations, and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during follow-up. Survival was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites. The former may provide better long-term control of ascites, but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Glucose reacts nonenzymatically with proteins in vivo, chemically forming covalently attached glucose-addition products and cross-links between proteins. The excessive accumulation of rearranged late-glucose-addition products, or advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), is believed to contribute to the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. METHODS. To elucidate the relation of AGEs to diabetic complications, we used a radioreceptor assay to measure serum and tissue AGEs in diabetic (Types I and Type II) and nondiabetic patients with different levels of renal function. Serum AGEs were measured as a low-molecular-weight (less than or equal to 10 kd) peptide fraction and a high-molecular-weight (greater than 10 kd) protein fraction. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) AGE content of samples of arterial-wall collagen from 9 diabetic patients was significantly higher than that of samples from 18 nondiabetic patients (14.5 +/- 5.2 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.5 AGE units per milligram, P less than 0.001). Moreover, diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease had almost twice as much AGE in tissue as diabetic patients without renal disease (21.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 11.5 +/- 1.9 AGE units per milligram, P less than 0.001). The AGE levels in both serum fractions were elevated in the patients with diabetes, and the levels of AGE peptides correlated directly with serum creatinine (P less than 0.001) and inversely with creatinine clearance (P less than 0.005), suggesting that levels of AGE peptides increased with the severity of diabetic nephropathy. In six patients with diabetes who required hemodialysis, the levels of AGE peptides were five times higher than in eight normal subjects (82.8 +/- 9.4 vs. 15.6 +/- 3.4 AGE units per milliliter, P less than 0.001). In another group of diabetic patients the mean serum creatinine level, which decreased by 75 percent during a session of hemodialysis, whereas the level of AGE peptides decreased by only 24 percent. Serum levels of AGE peptides were normal in two patients with normal serum creatinine levels after renal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. AGEs accumulate at a faster-than-normal rate in arteries and the circulation of patients with diabetes; the increase in circulating AGE peptides parallels the severity of renal functional impairment in diabetic nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Recipients of renal allografts are at an increased risk for skin cancer. It is also known that recipients who are homozygous for HLA antigens are at an increased risk for certain cancers, as are those who are mismatched with their donors for these antigens. In a case-control study we assessed the relation between skin cancer in renal-transplant recipients and HLA homozygosity and mismatching. METHODS. Of 764 patients who received renal transplants between 1966 and 1988, 66 had squamous-cell carcinoma or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin after transplantation. HLA homozygosity was assessed in all 66 recipients, and HLA mismatching in 39; the results were compared with those in 124 recipients without skin cancer. We also investigated the relation between skin cancer and the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In separate case-control analyses we investigated the influence of exposure to the sun and keratotic skin lesions on the risk of skin cancer. RESULTS. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma was increased in recipients mismatched for HLA-B antigens; the relative risks were 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 19.0) with mismatching for one and two antigens, respectively, as compared with no mismatching. Mismatching for HLA-A or HLA-DR antigens had no effect on the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma, and there was no association between mismatches at any of the HLA loci and the occurrence of basal-cell carcinoma. The total doses of azathioprine and prednisone were not associated with the occurrence of skin cancer or with HLA matching. Exposure to sunlight and keratotic skin lesions were strongly associated with skin cancer but not with HLA mismatching. Homozygosity for HLA-DR was more frequent among the patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.6) and among patients with 100 or more keratotic skin lesions (relative risk, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 15.1). CONCLUSIONS. HLA-B mismatching is significantly associated with the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma in renal-transplant recipients, as is HLA-DR homozygosity. An indirect effect on the level of immunosuppression does not appear to explain these findings, nor does exposure to sunlight or the number of keratotic skin lesions account for this observation.\r"

  ".U": "91342715\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The treadmill exercise test identifies patients with different degrees of risk of death from cardiovascular events. We devised a prognostic score, based on the results of treadmill exercise testing, that accurately predicts outcome among inpatients referred for cardiac catheterization. This study was designed to determine whether this score could also accurately predict prognosis in unselected outpatients. METHODS. We prospectively studied 613 consecutive outpatients with suspected coronary disease who were referred for exercise testing between 1983 and 1985. Follow-up was 98 percent complete at four years. The treadmill score was calculated as follows: duration of exercise in minutes--(5 x the maximal ST-segment deviation during or after exercise, in millimeters)--(4 x the treadmill angina index). The numerical treadmill angina index was 0 for no angina, 1 for nonlimiting angina, and 2 for exercise-limiting angina. Treadmill scores ranged from -25 (indicating the highest risk) to +15 (indicating the lowest risk). RESULTS. Predicted outcomes for the outpatients, based on their treadmill scores, agreed closely with the observed outcomes. The score accurately separated patients who subsequently died from those who lived for four years (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve = 0.849). The treadmill score was a better discriminator than the clinical data and was even more useful for outpatients than it had been for inpatients. Approximately two thirds of the outpatients had treadmill scores indicating low risk (greater than or equal to +5), reflecting longer exercise times and little or no ST-segment deviation, and their four-year survival rate was 99 percent (average annual mortality rate, 0.25 percent). Four percent of the outpatients had scores indicating high risk (less than -10), reflecting shorter exercise times and more severe ST-segment deviation; their four-year survival rate was 79 percent (average annual mortality rate, 5 percent). CONCLUSIONS. The treadmill score is a useful and valid tool that can help clinicians determine prognosis and decide whether to refer outpatients with suspected coronary disease for cardiac catheterization. In this study, it was a better predictor of outcome than the clinical assessment.\r"

Morphological similarities between kempi and olivacea, and a geographical distribution that \"...makes no sense at all under modern conditions of climate and geography\", raise questions about the degree of evolutionary divergence between these taxa. Analysis of mitochondrial (mt) DNA restriction sites shows that Kemp's ridley is distinct from the olive ridley in matriarchal phylogeny, and that the two are sister taxa with respect to other marine turtles. Separation of olive and the Kemp's ridley lineages may date to formation of the Isthmus of Panama, whereas the global spread of the olive ridley lineage occurred recently. In contrast to recent examples in which molecular genetic assessments challenged systematic assignments underlying conservation programmes, our mtDNA data corroborate the taxonomy of an endangered form.\r"

  ".U": "91342997\r", 
  ".W": "Na+/Ca2+ exchange is electrogenic and moves one net positive charge per cycle. Although the cardiac exchanger has a three-to-one Na+/Ca2+ stoichiometry, details of the reaction cycle are not well defined. Here we associate Na+ translocation by the cardiac exchanger with positive charge movement in giant membrane patches from cardiac myocytes and oocytes expressing the cloned cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The charge movements are initiated by step increments of the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration in the absence of Ca2+. Giant patches from control oocytes lack both steady-state Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (INaCa) and Na(+)-induced charge movements. Charge movements indicate about 400 exchangers per micron 2 in guinea-pig sarcolemma. Fully activated INaCa densities (20-30 microA cm-2) indicate maximum turnover rates of 5,000 s-1. As has been predicted for consecutive exchange models, the apparent ion affinities of steady state INaCa increase as the counterion concentrations are decreased. Consistent with an electroneutral Ca2+ translocation, we find that voltage dependence of INaCa in both directions is lost as Ca2+ concentration is decreased. The principal electrogenic step seems to be at the extracellular end of the Na+ translocation pathway.\r"

In man these include the loci encoding the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ and -DP antigens, and many diseases have been linked with these. But attempts to identify HLA genes in man that might explain why an immune response against malignant tumours should be ineffective have so far been disappointing, apart from the association reported between the HLA-DR1 antigen and a susceptibility to a rare carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Here we describe another strong connection between a common malignant tumour and an HLA antigen, namely between HLA-DQw3 and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: from the 1988 United States tumour registry, 1 in every 63 newborn girls will develop this invasive cancer. We found that 88% of 66 patients had the leukocyte antigen HLA-DQw3 when it would normally be expected in only 50% of individuals. In animals the immune system and the MHC act in defence against virally induced tumours, but until now there has been no evidence that they do so in humans: as squamous cell carcinoma is probably virally induced, our discovery of its association with an HLA antigen will be important to the understanding of the immunogenetic basis of a susceptibility to this tumour.\r"

Cells infected by ecotropic MuLV synthesize envelope protein, gp70, which binds to this receptor, thereby preventing additional infections. The consequences of envelope-MuLV receptor binding for the infected host cell have not been directly determined, partly because the cellular function of the MuLV receptor protein is unknown. Here we report a coincidence in the positions of the first eight putative membrane-spanning domains found in the virus receptor and in two related proteins, the arginine and histidine permeases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1), but not in any other proteins identified by computer-based sequence comparison of the GenBank data base. Xenopus oocytes injected with receptor-encoding messenger RNA show increased uptake of L-arginine, L-lysine and L-ornithine. The transport properties and the expression pattern of the virus receptor behave in ways previously attributed to y+, the principal transporter of cationic L-amino acids in mammalian cells.\r"

This mass of DNA, known as the kinetoplast, is present at a unique site in the single mitochondrion, and is replicated in a discrete, periodic S phase of the cell cycle. The single-copy nature of the kinetoplast suggests that there is a mechanism ensuring segregation fidelity of replicated copies to each daughter cell. Historically, speculation regarding the nature of this mechanism has often attributed significance to the close association between the kinetoplast and the flagellum basal body. We provide here direct evidence that this mitochondrial DNA complex is indeed linked to the basal body, and segregation of the kinetoplast DNA is dependent on a microtubule-mediated separation of the new and old flagellar basal bodies during the cell cycle. This unique system may represent the remnants of an evolutionarily archaic mechanism for genome segregation.\r"

Both the 50K and 65K subunits have similarity with the rel oncogene and the Drosophila maternal effect gene dorsal. The 50K DNA-binding subunit was previously thought to be a unique protein, derived from the 105K gene product (p105). We now report the isolation of a complementary DNA that encodes an alternative DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B. It is more similar to p105 NF-kappa B than other family members and defines a new subset of rel-related genes. It is synthesized as approximately 100K protein (p100) that is expressed in different cell types, contains cell cycle motifs and, like p105, must be processed to generate a 50K form. A 49K product (p49) can be generated independently from an alternatively spliced transcript; it has specific kappa B DNA-binding activity and can form heterodimers with other rel proteins. In contrast to the approximately 50K protein derived from p105, p49 acts in synergy with p65 to stimulate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer in transiently transfected Jurkat cells. p49/p100 NF-kappa B could therefore be important in the regulation of HIV and other kappa B-containing genes.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five consecutive adults with Chiari malformation and progressive symptoms underwent surgical treatment at a single institution over a 3-year period. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan before and after surgery. Images of the craniovertebral junction confirmed tonsillar herniation in all cases and allowed the definition of two anatomically distinct categories of the Chiari malformation in this age group. Twenty of the 35 patients had concomitant syringomyelia and were classified as Type A. The remaining 15 patients had evidence of frank herniation of the brain stem below the foramen magnum without evidence of syringomyelia and were labeled Type B. Type A patients had a predominant central cord symptomatology; Type B patients exhibited signs and symptoms of brain stem or cerebellar compression. The principal surgical procedure consisted of decompression of the foramen magnum, opening of the fourth ventricular outlet, and plugging of the obex. Significant improvement in preoperative symptoms and signs was observed in 9 of the 20 patients (45%) with syringomyelia (Type A), as compared to 13 of the 15 patients (87%) without syringomyelia (Type B). Postoperative reduction in syrinx volume was observed in 11 of the 20 patients with syringomyelia, including all 9 patients with excellent results. Magnetic resonance imaging has allowed a classification of the adult Chiari malformation in adults based on objective anatomic criteria, with clinical and prognostic relevance. The presence of syringomyelia implies a less favorable response to surgical intervention.\r"

The tumor size was determined by the mean maximum anteroposterior and mediolateral diameters, using computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained sequentially throughout the follow-up period. The average tumor growth was 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm the 1st year, and 1.9 +/- 1.0 mm the 2nd year (range, -2 to 17 mm/y): 4 tumors showed apparent regression, 28 (40%) had no detectable growth, and 37 (53%) exhibited growth (average, 3.8 +/- 1.2 mm/y). Within individual patients, the tumor growth rate determined during the 1st year of follow-up was predictive of tumor growth rate determined during the following year. Rapid tumor growth or clinical deterioration in 9 of the 70 patients (13%) who initially were treated conservatively necessitated subsequent surgery an average of 14 +/- 5 months after the patient was initially seen. This group had a larger initial tumor size (27.0 +/- 3.4 mm vs. 21.3 +/- 0.9 mm, P less than 0.05), and a faster 1-year growth rate (7.9 +/- 2.3 mm/y vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 mm/y, P less than 0.05) than the 61 patients who did not require surgery. Two patients, however, experienced neurological deterioration that required surgery, even though there was no tumor growth. The high incidence of acoustic tumors with no detectable growth or apparent spontaneous regression must be taken into account when evaluating the indications for surgery and the efficacy of radiotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, fetal astrocytes derived from homografted whole pieces of fetal cortex migrate only as individual cells throughout the brain of the rat but are not capable of invasion. Our experiment explored the migratory capacity (over 7 days) of cultured purified fetal astrocytes and C6 cells after seeding 10(6) cells on a hydrated artificial basement membrane wafer (Matrigel). The artificial basement membrane wafer was not a suitable substrate for the growth of cultured fetal astrocytes. In contrast, C6 cells migrated as individual cells from the surface of the wafer into the substrate. Individual C6 cells migrated 1.8 mm in the first 4 days and then ceased migration. The C6 cells were observed at the base of a digestion tube that extended from and was open to the surface of the wafer. At 3 days, micropockets were observed to form around each C6 cell at the base of each tube. By 7 days, the majority of pockets observed were large and contained several C6 cells. These multiple cell groups appeared to be progenitors of tumor masses. These data indicate that C6 glioma-astrocytoma cells, which in vivo appear to be a model for glioblastoma multiforme, primarily migrate as individual cells through artificial basement membrane and secondarily form tumor masses. Progenitor tumor masses form by coalescence of individual C6 cell micropockets or the division of a single cell in an individual micropocket.\r"

There were 7 children (aged 5 yr or younger) and 23 adults (aged 16 yr or older). There were 18 female patients and 12 male patients. Headache, nausea and vomiting, and disequilibrium were the most frequent symptoms. The most common findings were ataxia and nystagmus. Gross total resection was performed in 8 patients (27%), subtotal resection in 21 patients (70%), and biopsy in only 1 patient (3%). Tumors were low grade in 73% and high grade in 27%. Twenty-seven patients underwent posterior fossa radiotherapy (median dose, 5400 cGy). Fourteen patients also underwent spinal irradiation (median dose, 3520 cGy). Age was the only significant prognostic factor identified (P less than 0.01). The 5-year survival rates were 76% for adults and 14% for children. All 14 patients who died had recurrent or residual tumor at the primary site. This review suggests that in patients with primary posterior fossa ependymomas the following is true: 1) the young patient (5 yr old or younger) has a poor prognosis; 2) there was a trend toward a better 5-year survival rate with a gross total resection; 3) if recurrence occurs, it will be at the primary intracranial site; and 4) symptomatic spinal seeding does not occur frequently.\r"

  ".U": "91343099\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1970 and 1989, 29 patients with intracranial ependymomas were evaluated and treated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. With a median follow-up of 82 months, the actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 61 +/- 10% and 46 +/- 12%, respectively. Anaplastic histological findings were uncommon (2 of 29). Initial postoperative radiotherapy was given to 25 patients, with a median tumor dose of 5360 cGy. With a median time to recurrence of 22 months, local failure (within 2 cm of original enhancing mass) was the predominant pattern of relapse (15 of 16 failures). The presence of radiographic residual disease seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans was the most important prognostic variable for patients with intracranial ependymoma. Analysis of the 19 patients who underwent postoperative imaging revealed a 75 +/- 15% 5-year freedom from progressive disease for 9 patients with no residual disease, as compared with 0% freedom from progressive disease for the 10 patients with gross residual disease (P = 0.03). In contrast, the surgical assessment of residual disease was not significant (P = 0.4). Age at presentation was also a significant prognostic factor. The overall actuarial survival rate at 12 years for infants 24 months or younger at diagnosis was 0%, as compared with 62 +/- 13% for older patients (P = 0.03). For non-anaplastic ependymomas, complete surgical resection followed by local-field, high-dose (greater than 54 Gy) radiotherapy appears to offer the greatest chance for long-term survival. Because of the markedly reduced survival rate for patients with radiologically apparent postoperative disease, maximal surgical resection and novel therapeutic endeavors appear warranted for this high-risk group. Future protocols should use postoperative imaging, not operative reports, to stratify patients with ependymoma.\r"

Group 1 was a sham-operated group. Group 2 animals received a continuous cisternal injection of endothelin-1 (1.7 x 10(-9) mol/7 days) by a miniosmotic pump implanted in the neck musculature for 7 days. Group 3 received double injections of cisternal blood administered 48 hours apart. Angiography showed severe constriction of the basilar artery, 34.6% and 43% in Groups 2 and 3, respectively, on Day 7. Histological study showed marked constriction of the basilar artery in both Group 2 and Group 3. Degenerative changes in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were observed in both Group 2 and Group 3. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated endothelin-1 in the endothelial cells in Group 2, but not in Group 1 or in Group 3. It is suggested that endothelin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

  ".U": "91343101\r", 
  ".W": "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy appears to result from a combination of factors. The two major components are 1) compressive forces resulting from narrowing of the spinal canal, and 2) dynamic forces owing to mobility of the cervical spine. There is substantial evidence to suggest that the repetitive trauma to the spinal cord that is sustained with movement in a spondylotic canal may be a major cause of progressive myelopathy. Utilization of extensive anterior procedures that remove the diseased ventral features as well as eliminate the dynamic forces owing to the accompanying fusion have grown in popularity. Cervical laminectomy enlarges the spinal canal, but does not reduce the dynamic forces affecting the spinal cord, and may actually increase cervical mobility, leading to a perpetuation of the myelopathy. The authors propose the combination of posterior decompression and Luque rectangle bone fusion to deal with both the compressive and the dynamic factors that lead to cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Ten patients who had advanced myelopathy underwent the combined procedures. Nine of the 10 experienced significant neurological improvement, and the 10th has had no progression. The combination of posterior decompression and Luque rectangle bone fusion may offer a simple, safe, and effective alternative treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The indications for repeated operation in patients with persistent or recurrent pain after lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established. Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and in no case has mean follow-up exceeded 3 years. We report 5-year mean follow-up for a series of repeated operations performed between 1979 and 1983. Patient characteristics and modes of treatment have been assessed as predictors of long-term outcome. One hundred two patients with \"failed back surgery syndrome\" (averaging 2.4 previous operations), who underwent a repeated operation for lumbosacral decompression and/or stabilization, were interviewed by a disinterested third party a mean of 5.05 years postoperatively. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain for 2 years or at last follow-up, and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 34% of patients. Twenty-one patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work postoperatively; 15 who were working preoperatively became disabled or retired postoperatively. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded, overall, as often as decrements. Loss of neurological function (strength, sensation, bowel and bladder control) was reported by patients more often than improvement. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for young patients and for female patients. Favorable outcome also was associated with a history of good results from previous operations, with the absence of epidural scar requiring surgical lysis, with employment before surgery, and with predominance of radicular (as opposed to axial) pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord stimulation, in use for more than 20 years, has evolved into an easily implemented technique, with percutaneous methods for electrode placement. We have reviewed our experience with this technique in treating \"failed back surgery syndrome,\" and have assessed patient and treatment characteristics as predictors of long-term outcome. A series of 50 patients with failed back surgery syndrome (averaging 3.1 previous operations), who underwent spinal cord stimulator implantation, was interviewed by impartial third parties, at mean follow-up intervals of 2.2 years and 5.0 years. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 53% of patients at 2.2 years and in 47% of patients at 5.0 years postoperatively. Ten of 40 patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in most patients for most activities; loss of function was rare. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for female patients and for those with programmable multi-contact implanted devices. These results, in patients with postsurgical lumbar arachnoid and epidural fibrosis and without surgically remediable lesions, compare favorably with the results in two separate series of patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom 1) surgical lesions were diagnosed and repeated operation performed; and 2) monoradicular pain syndromes were diagnosed and dorsal root ganglionectomies performed at our institution. This suggests the need for further assessment of selection criteria, critical analysis of treatment outcome, and prospective study of spinal cord stimulation and alternative approaches to failed back surgery syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Improved control of postoperative pain is now known to reduce the incidence of morbidity. Although spinally administered narcotics have found a clear role in chest and abdominal surgery, their role in lumbar spinal surgery is debated. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intrathecally administered morphine sulfate after lumbar spinal surgery in 56 patients. Patients received 0, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine during extradural lumbar spinal operations, and the effects on postoperative analog pain scores, narcotic consumption, complications, and length of hospitalization were assessed. As compared with systemic narcotic administration, intrathecally administered morphine provided superior analgesia in a dose-dependent fashion without an increase in narcotic side effects. Consumption of parenteral narcotics on the first postoperative day and over the total hospitalization period decreased in correlation with increasing doses of intrathecally administered morphine. Mean length of hospitalization was significantly decreased, as compared with the control group, in patients receiving 0.25 or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine. When proper precautions are observed, intrathecally administered morphine can improve the postoperative care of patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery.\r"
