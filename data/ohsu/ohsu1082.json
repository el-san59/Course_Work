  ".W": "Alveolar and lung liquid clearance were studied over 8 h in intact anesthetized ventilated rabbits by instillation of either isosmolar Ringer lactate (2 ml/kg) or autologous plasma (2 or 3 ml/kg) into one lower lobe. The half time for lung liquid clearance of the isosmolar Ringer lactate was 3.3 h and that for plasma clearance was 6 h. In the plasma experiments, the alveolar protein concentration after 1 h was 5.2 +/- 0.8 g/dl, which was significantly greater than the initial instilled protein concentration of 4.3 +/- 0.7 g/dl (P less than 0.05). Thus alveolar protein concentration increased by 21 +/- 12% over 1 h, which matched clearance from the entire lung of 19 +/- 11% of the instilled volume. Overall the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance in rabbits was significantly faster than in prior studies in dogs and sheep. The fast alveolar liquid clearance rate in rabbits was not due to higher endogenous catecholamine release, because intravenous and alveolar (5 x 10(-5) M) propranolol did not slow the clearance. Also, beta-adrenergic therapy with alveolar terbutaline (10(-5) or 10(-4) M) did not increase the alveolar or lung liquid clearance rates. Phloridzin (10(-3) M) did not slow alveolar liquid clearance. However, amiloride (10(-4) M) inhibited 75% of the basal alveolar liquid clearance in rabbits, thus providing evidence that alveolar liquid clearance in rabbits depends primarily on sodium-dependent transport. This rabbit study provides further evidence for important species differences in the basal rates of alveolar liquid and solute clearance as well as the response to beta-adrenergic agonists and ion transport inhibitors.\r"

Five-minute 13C-NMR measurement of muscle glycogen had a reproducibility of +/- 6.5% (+/- 4.8 mM). Experiments were performed on healthy fed male and female subjects. Two protocols were followed. 1) Subjects performed plantar flexion from rest at 15, 20, or 25% of maximum voluntary contraction for up to 9 h. 2) Subjects predepleted gastrocnemius glycogen with heavy exercise and then either performed low-intensity exercise as before or rested. Gastrocnemius glycogen was measured by NMR at rest and after each hour of exercise. In some sessions, both the exercised leg and the nonexercised leg were monitored with 13C-NMR. In protocol 1, blood velocity in the femoral artery was similarly assessed with ultrasonography. During low-intensity exercise from rest (protocol 1) muscle glycogen fell to a new steady-state value after several hours and then remained constant despite continued exercise. Mean blood velocity increased ninefold within 2 min of onset of exercise and remained constant thereafter. After predepletion (protocol 2), muscle glycogen was repleted both during low-intensity exercise and at rest. After 1 h the amount of glycogen repletion was greater when coupled with light exercise [48.5 +/- 2.8 mM after 1 h of exercise, 39.7 +/- 1.1 mM after 1 h of rest (P less than 0.05)]. During subsequent light exercise, glycogen reached a steady-state value similar to that obtained in protocol 1, while in resting, recovery glycogen levels continued to increase (+2.7 mM/h) over a 7-h period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The model consists of parallel tissue cylinders with varying radii, simulating the heterogeneity of capillary spacing, in agreement with our previous experimental results. The facilitated diffusion of O2 by myoglobin, an additional resistance to diffusion at the capillary level, and the Michaelis-Menten type of O2 consumption were also incorporated. The shape of the histograms depends on input data. When no additional barrier to O2 transport is included, the histograms resemble those obtained with Po2 surface electrodes, and they are strongly dependent on heterogeneity in capillary spacing and capillary blood flow. On the other hand, an inclusion of an additional capillary barrier combined with the Michaelis-Menten type of O2 consumption can generate Po2 histograms similar to those derived from myoglobin cryospectroscopy. In this case, the Po2 histograms are relatively independent of heterogeneity of capillary spacing and blood flow. The facilitation of O2 diffusion by myoglobin has only a modest effect on the form of the histograms in all situations considered.\r"

In lungs perfused for 20 min with homologous blood or a physiological salt solution (PSS) containing 4 g/100 ml albumin, mean PS values, obtained by the single-sample method of Kern et al. [Am. J.

These values were similar to lung PS obtained in intact rats (7.7 +/- 0.4 cm3.min-1.g wet lung-1.10(-2). In perfused lungs, PS values were influenced by the perfusate albumin concentration, the length of perfusion time, and the degree of vascular recruitment. Twenty minutes after lung isolation, PS was 126% higher in lungs perfused with albumin-free PSS containing Ficoll than in lungs perfused with albumin-PSS. Moreover, PS in Ficoll-PSS-perfused lungs increased even higher after 2 h of perfusion, and this time-dependent increase in PS was attenuated by addition of 0.1 g/100 ml albumin to the perfusate. Two hours of ex vivo ventilation with hypoxic (0 or 3% 0(2)) or hyperoxic (95% 0(2)) gas mixture did not affect PS values in perfused lungs. However, PS was elevated in lungs perfused ex vivo with protamine, which causes endothelial cell injury, or in lungs from rats exposed in vivo to human recombinant tumor necrosis factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We now describe a reduced pulmonary vascular response to alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II (ANG II) in F compared with SD rats. The comparative studies were performed with isolated lungs perfused with salt solution or blood, catheter-implanted awake rats, and isolated main pulmonary arterial rings. Isolated lungs from F rats perfused with either blood or salt solution had reduced vasoconstriction in comparison with lungs from SD rats when exposed to alveolar hypoxia or challenged with ANG II. Instrumented awake F rats had a smaller mean increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than SD rats (35 vs. 94 mmHg.min.l-1, P less than 0.05) when challenged with 8% oxygen. The contractile response of isolated pulmonary artery but not thoracic aortic rings to KCl and ANG II was reduced in F compared with SD rats. In addition, F rats exposed to 4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia developed less pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (when corrected for the hematocrit) than SD rats. We conclude that the oxidant stress-sensitive inbred F rat strain is characterized by a lung vascular bed that is relatively unresponsive to vasoconstricting stimuli. The mechanism underlying this genetic difference in lung vascular control remains to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of energy state in pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia, we exposed isolated pig lungs to decreases in inspired PO2 or increases in perfusate NaCN concentration. Lung energy state was assessed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or measurement of adenine nucleotides by high-pressure liquid chromatography in freeze-clamped biopsies. In ventilated lungs, inspired PO2 of 200 (normoxia), 50 (hypoxia), and 0 Torr (anoxia) did not change adenine nucleotides but resulted in steady-state pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) values of 15.5 +/- 1.4, 30.3 +/- 1.8, and 17.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively, indicating vasoconstriction during hypoxia and reversal of vasoconstriction during anoxia. In degassed lungs, similar changes in Ppa were observed; however, energy state deteriorated during anoxia. An increase in perfusate NaCN concentration from 0 to 0.1 mM progressively increased Ppa and did not alter adenine nucleotides, whereas 1 mM reversed this vasoconstriction and caused deterioration of energy state. These results suggest that 1) pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to hypoxia or cyanide occurred independently of whole lung energy state, 2) the inability of the pulmonary vasculature to sustain hypoxic vasoconstriction during anoxia might be associated with decreased energy state in some lung compartment, and 3) atelectasis was detrimental to whole lung energy state.\r"

  ".W": "A model to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function in humans has been developed. Unilateral lower limb unloading that allowed ankle, knee, and hip joint mobility was conducted in six healthy men by suspending one lower limb and having the subjects walk on crutches. They performed maximal unilateral concentric or eccentric quadriceps actions at different angular velocities before and after 4 wk of suspension and after 4 days and after 7 wk of uncontrolled recovery. Peak torque (PT) and angle-specific torque (AST) were measured. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological density (RD) of the thigh were assessed by means of computerized tomography. Concentric and eccentric PT and AST across speeds decreased (P less than 0.05) by 22 and 16%, respectively, in response to unloading. At 4 days of recovery PT (-11%) and AST (-7%) were still lower (P less than 0.05) than before. Muscle CSA and RD decreased (P less than 0.05) by 7 and 6%, respectively. After 7 wk of recovery PT, AST, CSA, and RD had returned to normal. The control limb showed no changes over the experimental period except for a 6% decrease (P less than 0.05) in RD. It is suggested that this human model of unloading could serve to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function because reductions in muscle mass and strength were of similar magnitude to those produced by bed rest.\r"

The effect of cooling on the reactivity of the human coronary artery (CA), saphenous vein (SV) and internal mammary artery (IMA) was studied in vitro. In CA and IMA cooling diminished the resting tension and the contraction to potassium, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine. In contrast, in SV the contraction to noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine was augmented by cooling. The effect of cold was reversible. These results demonstrate different effects of hypothermia in CA and the graft vessels. Thus, hypothermia augments the receptor-mediated contraction in SV but depresses it in IMA which thereby resembles CA. The difference is most marked in the contractile response to 5-hydroxytryptamine, which may accumulate during surgery. This may contribute to spasm in the saphenous vein grafts and may be involved in the mechanisms responsible for the inferior patency of SV compared to IMA as a graft vessel.\r"

Daily A-P radiographs were evaluated for atelectasis, cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, diaphragmatic elevation, mediastinal widening, and pulmonary infiltrates. The overall incidence of atelectasis was 82%, with left lower lobe atelectasis the most common (64%). Right upper lobe atelectasis occurred in 35% of patients, far more common than in the adult. Radiographic changes were then compared with independent variables including patient weight, age, duration of bypass, and fluid balance by multiple linear regression. Pleural effusion correlated with patient weight and duration of bypass. Diaphragmatic elevation correlated with patient weight. Cardiomegaly correlated with patient age. Net fluid balance was a poor predictor of postoperative chest radiograph changes. We conclude that radiographic changes are common after cardiopulmonary bypass in children, that the overall incidence is not markedly different from adults, and that right upper lobe atelectasis occurs more frequently in children.\r"

The surgical treatment consisted of resection of the subvalvular fibrous tissue and subsequent aortic valvuloplasty. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a wide systolic opening of the aortic valve and good coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in diastole. Two-dimensional color-coded and contrast echocardiography were successfully used to confirm a satisfactory reconstruction. Transesophageal echocardiography therefore represents a valuable tool in the assessment of the morphologic and haemodynamic status, especially in rare cases of congenital heart disease in older children.\r"

  ".W": "In 81 Beagle dogs, 6 cm long segments of the inferior vena cava were replaced end-to-end by artificial vascular grafts (10 mm in diameter) without an av-fistula and anticoagulant drugs. Different graft materials have been used, such as various e-PTFE (30-90 microns fiber length) and polyurethane with low and increased microporosity. e-PTFE with 75 microns fiber length and polyurethane with increased porosity showed the best tissue incorporation, complete endothelialization of the whole length and a high patency rate of 80-85% after a follow-up of 12 months. In contrast to other commercially available vascular grafts (textile woven or knitted, e-PTFE 30 microns) tested in previous series, polyurethane and e-PTFE with increased microporosity had already achieved complete endothelialization after 6-12 weeks. Therefore, these optimized prostheses should be introduced into clinical practice for large venous substitution. Thereafter, an adjunctive av-fistula as protection is probably no longer necessary.\r"

From 1975 until 1988 direct carotid-subclavian anastomosis was used in 32 patients and carotid-subclavian bypass in 19. There were no statistically significant differences for the probability of postoperative survival (p less than 0.877 Breslow; p less than 0.774 Mantel), intraoperative blood loss or the duration of anaesthesia. Those patients who had undergone subclavian artery repair had a significantly longer survival than those following carotid bifurcation endarterectomy (p less than 0.002 Breslow, p less than 0.0002 Mantel). As patients with subclavian lesions have a reasonable life-expectancy, they may possibly experience late complications of their vascular repair. Therefore it seems important to select the most durable operation, and direct carotid subclavian anastomosis has a significantly greater patency rate than bypass (p less than 0.006 Breslow, p less than 0.006 Mantel). Patients with preoperative symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency had a lower probability of survival than those with upper extremity claudication, although this did not reach statistical significance (p less than 0.205 Breslow; p less than 0.198 Mantel).\r"

In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment. Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin. We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur. We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa.\r"

To assess the predictability of the bypass grafts by this runoff scoring system, we compared this runoff score with postoperative increase in the ankle/brachial index (delta ABI) and intraoperatively measured flow waveform patterns in 60 patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafts. No correlation was found between delta ABI and the runoff score. Graft-patent survival time correlated with the runoff score (r = 0.44, p = 0.02). Grafts with type 0 or I flow waveform pattern with a satisfactory long-term patency had a significantly lower runoff score than grafts with type II, III or IV flow waveform pattern (p less than 0.05). When all the grafts were arbitrarily divided into two groups (grafts with a runoff score over 4.5 and those with a score of less than 4.0), a superior long-term patency was obtained in the low runoff score group with polytetrafluoroethylene (p less than 0.01) and saphenous vein grafts (p = 0.04), but not in the group with composite grafts (p = 0.25). Thus, the SVS/ISCVS runoff scoring system can be used to predict the fate of bypass grafts in femoropopliteal arterial reconstructions.\r"

The standard technique was modified by using a long injection time, a large volume of contrast material (iopamidol 370), prolonged filming and multiple exposures of the feet. On the basis of these examinations each limb was classified as having aorto-iliac disease (18 limbs), superficial femoral disease (103 limbs), combined segment disease (28 limbs) or generalised disease (51 limbs). Calf and ankle arteries were seen in 196 of the 200 limbs (98%). Patency of the pedal arch was established in 184 (92%). Fourteen percent of the group of patients with combined segment disease did not have their pedal arch visualised and this group contained most of the examination failures. This modified method of aortography can demonstrate the entire arterial tree from the aorta to the foot in 92% of limbs with symptomatic chronic atherosclerotic disease. This allows the majority of peripheral vascular reconstructions to be planned and performed without the need for intra-operative arteriography.\r"

Six lower limbs amputated at thigh level for arteriosclerotic gangrene with complete obstruction of the main tibial arteries, were studied: the tibial collateral muscular vessels showed patency in 65% of cases.

The effect of varying renal perfusion pressure (RPP) on paired determinations of directly measured PG was evaluated in glomeruli of nephrons in which distal fluid delivery was present (unblocked). Autoregulation of PG in Sh glomeruli with unblocked tubules occurred at RPP values between 99.5 +/- 1.0 and 132.1 +/- 1.0 mmHg. In contrast, in Nx glomeruli with unblocked tubules PG increased by 0.32 +/- 0.07 mmHg/mmHg increase in RPP over this same range of RPP (P less than 0.0001). To determine whether enhanced prostaglandins synthesis was responsible for the altered regulation of PG in Nx glomeruli, we repeated the micropuncture measurements in a setting of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. Although prostaglandins synthesis inhibition did not affect the autoregulation of PG in Sh glomeruli, it did normalize the autoregulatory capacity for PG of Nx glomeruli with unblocked tubules. Thus, acute Nx is associated with a significant loss of the autoregulatory capacity for PG and this impairment appears to be related to a prostaglandin-mediated alteration of the responsiveness of the vascular effector site for autoregulation.\r"

Reduction of thyroidal iodine was achieved with KClO4, an inhibitor of iodine transport and mononitrotyrosine (MNT), a drug that promotes loss of thyroidal iodine as iodotyrosines. A regimen consisting of KClO4 and MNT administration beginning in ovo and continuing after hatching reduced thyroidal infiltration to 2% of control values and decreased thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) production for as long as 9 wk. Untreated birds had severe disease by 5 wk of age. The suppression of disease was independent of TSH, not mediated by generalized immunosuppression and reversed by excess dietary iodine. Two drugs that inhibit the metabolism of iodine, propylthiouracil (PTU) and aminotriazole, reduced thyroidal infiltration and TgAb levels, although to a lesser extent. When splenocytes from OS chickens with thyroiditis were transferred to Cornell strain (CS) chickens, a related strain that develops late onset mild disease, only the recipients that were iodine supplemented developed thyroiditis. In conclusion, autoimmune thyroiditis in an animal model can be prevented by reducing thyroidal iodine or its metabolism and optimal effects require intervention at the embryonic stage.\r"

  ".W": "This study was initiated to characterize nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory neurotransmission in penile corpus cavernosum. Using organ baths, isometric tension measurements were made in strips of human and rabbit corpus cavernosum. In examining endothelium-mediated responses, cumulative additions of exogenous acetylcholine elicited dose-dependent relaxations which were significantly reduced or completely inhibited in tissues treated with NG-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA; an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis), oxyhemoglobin (a nitric oxide scavenger), or methylene blue (a guanylate cyclase blocker). Tissues exposed to hypoxic conditions (PO2 = 5-10 mmHg) also did not respond to exogenous acetylcholine. Mechanical removal of the endothelium in human corporal strips or in situ treatment of rabbit corpora with detergent blocked the relaxation to acetylcholine. Transmural electrical stimulation of corporal tissue strips denuded of functional endothelium, in the presence of adrenergic blockade with bretylium and muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine, caused frequency-dependent relaxation. This neurogenic relaxation was reduced or prevented by L-NMMA, oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, and hypoxia. The effects of L-NMMA were reversed by L-arginine and the effects of hypoxia were readily reversed by normoxic conditions. Authentic, exogenous nitric oxide relaxed corporal strips which were contracted with adrenergic agonists and this effect was significantly inhibited by oxyhemoglobin. It is concluded that (a) endothelium-mediated responses of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle are mediated by a diffusible nitric oxide-like substance; (b) NANC neurogenic inhibitory responses do not require functional endothelium, and (c) nitric oxide, or a closely related substance, may act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle.\r"

In the medulla, H+ ATPase staining in acid-loaded rats shifted from cytoplasmic vesicles to plasma membrane, whereas in alkali-loaded rats, cytoplasmic vesicle staining was enhanced, and staining of plasma membrane disappeared. In the cortical collecting tubule, acid loading increased the number of intercalated cells showing enhanced apical H+ ATPase staining and decreased the number of cells with basolateral or poorly polarized apical staining. The results indicate that both medulla and cortex participate in the adaptive response to acid and alkali loading by changing the steady-state distribution of H+ ATPase, employing mechanisms that do not necessitate postulating interconversion of intercalated cells with opposing polarities.\r"

  ".W": "Although glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of immunohematologic disease, their relative efficacy is uncertain. We used an animal model, which has helped to elucidate the role of splenic macrophage Fc gamma receptors in the clearance of IgG-coated cells, to investigate whether each Fc gamma receptor is modulated by glucocorticoids to the same extent and to examine the relative potency of three commonly used glucocorticoids. Cortisol, prednisone, and dexamethasone all impaired the clearance of IgG-coated erythrocytes. However, dexamethasone was more effective than either prednisone or cortisol (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, splenic macrophages isolated from glucocorticoid-treated animals expressed impaired Fc gamma receptor function. This effect was greater in macrophages isolated from dexamethasone-treated animals, as compared to either cortisol- or prednisone-treated animals (P less than 0.001). To assess the effect of glucocorticoids on the two types of guinea pig splenic macrophage Fc gamma receptors, Fc gamma R1,2 and Fc gamma R2, specific immunoglobulin isotypes were used to measure macrophage binding of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. Cortisol and prednisone primarily affected Fc gamma R2, whereas dexamethasone inhibited the function of both guinea pig Fc gamma receptors. Furthermore, dexamethasone was more effective (P less than 0.01) than either prednisone or cortisol in inhibiting the ability of both receptors to bind IgG-sensitized cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies specific for each of these two receptors demonstrated that essentially all splenic macrophages expressed both receptors, and that these glucocorticoids decreased the level of each Fc gamma receptor protein expressed, rather than altering receptor mobility and clustering in the macrophage membrane. The effect on both Fc gamma receptors was greatest with dexamethasone and least with cortisol. These studies demonstrate the significant role of guinea pig splenic macrophage Fc gamma R2 in immune clearance and in the binding of IgG-coated cells. They demonstrate a differential effect of glucocorticoid hormones on Fc gamma receptor function and on surface receptor protein. Furthermore, they suggest that dexamethasone may be a more effective glucocorticoid than either prednisone or cortisol in inhibiting the clearance of IgG-coated cells by its effect on splenic macrophage Fc gamma receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Although the importance of the hepatic glucose load in the regulation of liver glucose uptake has been clearly demonstrated in in vitro systems, the relationship between the hepatic glucose load and hepatic glucose uptake has yet to be defined in vivo. Likewise, the effects of the route of glucose delivery (peripheral or portal) on this relationship have not been explored. The aims of the present study were to determine the relationship between net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) and the hepatic glucose load in vivo and to examine the effects of the route of glucose delivery on this relationship. NHGU was evaluated at three different hepatic glucose loads in 42-h fasted, conscious dogs in both the absence (n = 7) and the presence (n = 6) of intraportal glucose delivery. In the absence of intraportal glucose delivery and in the presence of hepatic glucose loads of 50.5 +/- 5.9, 76.5 +/- 10.0, and 93.6 +/- 10.0 mg/kg/min and arterial insulin levels of approximately 33 microU/ml, NHGU was 1.16 +/- 0.37, 2.78 +/- 0.82, and 5.07 +/- 1.20 mg/kg/min, respectively. When a portion of the glucose load was infused into the portal vein and similar arterial insulin levels (approximately 36 microU/ml) and hepatic glucose loads (52.5 +/- 4.5, 70.4 +/- 5.6, and 103.6 +/- 18.4 mg/kg/min) were maintained, NHGU was twice that seen in the absence of portal loading (3.77 +/- 0.40, 4.80 +/- 0.59, and 9.62 +/- 1.43 mg/kg/min, respectively). Thus, net hepatic glucose uptake demonstrated a direct dependence on the hepatic glucose load that did not reach saturation even at elevations in the hepatic glucose load of greater than three times basal. In addition, the presence of intraportal glucose delivery increased net hepatic glucose uptake apparently by lowering the threshold at which the liver switched from net glucose output to net glucose uptake.\r"

Results: (a) Insulin-resistant subjects gained less weight than insulin-sensitive subjects (3.1 vs. 7.6 kg, P less than 0.0001). (b) The percent weight change per year correlated with glucose disposal at submaximally-(r = 0.19, P less than 0.01) and maximally-stimulating (r = 0.34, P less than 0.0001) insulin concentrations independent of sex, age, initial weight, and 24-h energy expenditure; the correlations were stronger for glucose oxidation than for glucose storage. (c) Weight gain was associated with an increase in insulin resistance more than four times that predicted from the cross-sectional data. We conclude that insulin resistance is associated with a reduced risk of weight gain in nondiabetic Pima Indians.\r"

By combining in situ hybridization with the sensitive detection technique of confocal laser scanning microscopy, we have demonstrated HIV RNA transcripts in 5 of 15 lesional skin biopsies from HIV-infected psoriasis patients, and in 3 of 8 Kaposi's sarcoma biopsies from HIV-infected patients. HIV transcripts were not detected in normal appearing skin from HIV-infected patients or in psoriatic and normal skin biopsies from uninfected individuals (P = 0.006). Although previous attempts to demonstrate viral sequences in psoriasis and KS lesions have been unsuccessful, in situ hybridization with confocal microscopy has shown the presence of HIV RNA transcripts predominantly within CD4+, Factor XIIIa positive dermal dendrocytes. HIV or cytokines produced by infected cells in skin lesions may therefore play a direct role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated psoriasis and KS.\r"

Two anti-idiotypic MAb, designated BEC2 and BEC3, recognized distinct determinants on MAb R24 that mapped near or within the GD3-binding site. New Zealand white rabbits, which express GD3 on normal tissues, were immunized with either BEC2, BEC3, or control MAb FLOPC-21. All rabbits developed high and equivalent titers of antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins. Immunization with BEC2 and BEC3 induced rabbit antibodies expressing R24 idiotype as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit BEC2 binding to R24. Antibodies (IgG and IgM) reacting with GD3 developed in five of eight rabbits immunized with BEC2 but not in rabbits immunized with BEC3 or with control MAb. Serum antibodies against GD3 did not cross-react with other gangliosides. These results show that MAb BEC2 can mimic GD3 ganglioside and can induce antibodies against GD3 ganglioside despite expression of GD3 on normal rabbit tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, combined serological and molecular studies of autoantibodies have revealed that these antibodies play an important role in the normal function of the immune system and in the development of the B cell repertoire. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a homozygous deletion of a critical autoantibody-associated Ig variable (V) gene may alter the immune system and thus predispose the host to autoimmune disorders. Initial experiments revealed several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the Humhv3005 gene, that is likely to encode heavy chains of rheumatoid factors, and the closely related 1.9III gene. By probing EcoR1-digested DNA with the Humhv3005/P1 probe, we found that one of the four major hybridizing bands was missing in approximately 20% of patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, but only 2% of normal subjects. To delineate the genetic basis of this polymorphism, we have now employed the PCR to amplify and analyze hv3005, 1.9III, and homologous genes in individuals with characteristic RFLP genotypes. Our results indicate that the human Vh gene repertoire contains several hv3005- and 1.9III-like genes, and that a complete deletion of the hv3005-like genes is relatively restricted to a subset of autoimmune patients. These findings provide initial evidence for deletion of developmentally regulated autoreactive V genes in autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".U": "91277281\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the mechanisms involved in the adherence of normal peripheral blood eosinophils to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) under three conditions: (a) adherence in the absence of treatment of HEC or eosinophils with activating agents (basal adherence); (b) adherence induced by stimulation of eosinophils with phorbol ester (eosinophil-dependent adherence); and (c) adherence induced by pretreatment of HEC with LPS, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or IL-1 (endothelial-dependent adherence). A mechanism was identified that was equally active in basal, eosinophil-dependent, and endothelial-dependent adherence. This mechanism was optimally active in the presence of both Ca++ and Mg++, and reduced in the presence of Ca++ only or Mg++ only. Furthermore, like the other mechanisms of eosinophil adherence, it was active at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. A second mechanism of adherence was involved in eosinophil- and in endothelial-dependent adherence. This mechanism was dependent on the CD11/CD18 adhesion complex of eosinophils (i.e., inhibited by anti-CD18 MAb) and it was active in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ or Mg++ only, but not Ca++ only. The third mechanism of adherence was specific for endothelial-dependent adherence. It involved the endothelial ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the eosinophil receptor very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29, i.e., inhibited by anti-VCAM-1 MAb or anti-VLA-4 MAb). This mechanism was active in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ but not of Ca++ only or Mg++ only, and was not up- or downregulated when eosinophils were stimulated with phorbol ester. In contrast, the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), that binds neutrophils and monocytes, was not involved in eosinophil adherence to LPS-, TNF-, or IL-1-stimulated HEC (i.e., not inhibited by anti-ELAM-1 MAb). We conclude that eosinophils, like monocytes and lymphocytes, bind to the cytokine-induced endothelial ligand VCAM-1 via the integrin receptor VLA-4.\r"

After 2 h of hypoxia in the presence of 5 mM glucose, cell surface beta AR density (3H-CGP-12177) decreased from 54.8 +/- 8.4 to 39 +/- 6.3 (SE) fmol/mg protein (n = 10, P less than 0.025), while cytosolic beta AR density (125I-iodocyanopindolol [ICYP]) increased by 74% (n = 5, P less than 0.05). Upon reexposure to oxygen cell surface beta AR density returned toward control levels. Cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation without glucose exhibited similar alterations in beta AR density. In hypoxic cells incubated with 5 mM glucose, the addition of 1 microM (-)-norepinephrine (NE) increased cAMP generation from 29.3 +/- 10.6 to 54.2 +/- 16.1 pmol/35 mm plate (n = 5, P less than 0.025); upon reoxygenation cAMP levels remained elevated above control (n = 5, P less than 0.05). In contrast, NE-stimulated cAMP content in glucose-deprived hypoxic myocytes fell by 31% (n = 5, P less than 0.05) and did not return to control levels with reoxygenation. beta AR-agonist affinity assessed by (-)-isoproterenol displacement curves was unaltered after 2 h of hypoxia irrespective of glucose content. Addition of forskolin (100 microM) to glucose-supplemented hypoxic cells increased cAMP generation by 60% (n = 5; P less than 0.05), but in the absence of glucose this effect was not seen. In cells incubated in glucose-containing medium, the decline in intracellular ATP levels was attenuated after 2 h of hypoxia (21 vs. 40%, P less than 0.05). Similarly, glucose supplementation prevented LDH release in hypoxic myocytes. We conclude that (a) oxygen and glucose independently regulate beta AR density and agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation; (b) hypoxia has no effect on beta AR-agonist or antagonist affinity; (c) 5 mM glucose attenuates the rate of decline in cellular ATP levels during both hypoxia and reoxygenation; and (d) glucose prevents hypoxia-induced LDH release, a marker of cell injury.\r"

In order to identify immunodominant core epitopes, peripheral blood T cells purified from 23 patients with acute hepatitis B and different HLA haplotypes were tested with a panel of 18 short synthetic peptides (15 to 20 amino acids [AA]) covering the entire core region. All patients except one showed a strong T cell proliferative response to a single immunodominant 20 amino acid sequence located within the aminoterminal half of the core molecule. Two additional important sequences were also identified at the aminoterminal end and within the carboxyterminal half of the core molecule. These sequences were able to induce significant levels of T cell proliferation in 69 and 73% of the patients studied, respectively. T cell response to these epitopes was HLA class II restricted. The observations that (a) polyclonal T cell lines produced by PBMC stimulation with native HBcAg were specifically reactive with the relevant peptides and that (b) polyclonal T cell lines produced with synthetic peptides could be restimulated with native HBcAg, provide evidence that AA sequences contained within the synthetic peptides represent real products of the intracellular processing of the native core molecule. In conclusion, the identification of immunodominant T cell epitopes within the core molecule provides the molecular basis for the design of alternative and hopefully more immunogenic vaccines.\r"

IL-4 (100 U/ml) suppressed the spontaneous DNA synthesis by approximately 50% in 5 of 8 cases examined. IL-4 (100 U/ml) also inhibited the spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in a methylcellulose culture by 50-97% in all of the 10 cases in which spontaneous colonies were formed. This IL-4-mediated suppression of the growth of CMMoL cells was completely abolished by the addition of anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies. The spontaneous CMMoL colonies were substantially suppressed by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies to the colony assay system: the addition of both anti-IL-6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies resulted in greater than 80% inhibition of the colony formation by CMMoL cells. On the other hand, none of anti-IL-1-beta, anti-granulocyte-CSF, anti-macrophage-CSF, or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies affected the CMMoL colony formation. In the supernatants from 24-h cultures of CMMoL cells, high levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF were demonstrated in 9 of 9 and 2 of 9 cases examined, respectively. IL-4 (100 U/ml) almost completely inhibited the secretion of IL-6 and GM-CSF by CMMoL cells. These observations suggest that IL-4 suppresses the spontaneous proliferation of CMMoL cells by inhibiting their production of IL-6 and/or GM-CSF, both of which could act in vitro as an autocrine growth factor for CMMoL cells.\r"

No significant differences in CD4/CD8 ratios were seen when microfilariae-positive individuals from Guatemala were compared with Guatemalan controls. However, the infected individuals had significantly increased numbers of circulating CD4+CD45RA+ lymphocytes (mean 38.3%) when compared with controls (mean 16.0%). Coexpression of the activation marker HLA-DR was significantly increased on CD4+ cells from infected individuals. In contrast, no up-regulation of HLA-DR was seen on CD8+ or CD19+ cells. At 1 year after initiation of treatment with semiannual doses of the microfilaricide ivermectin, there were significant increases (P less than 0.05) in the percentage of CD4+CD45RA- cells, the percentage of CD4+HLA-DR+ cells, and mitogen-induced lymphokine production (IL-2, IL-4). Despite these changes, parasite-specific IL-2 and IL-4 production which had been undetectable before treatment did not manifest itself even by the 2-yr follow-up. Defects in the T-cell activation pathway in Onchocerca volvulus-infected individuals may thus exist at several independent points; a state of parasite antigen-specific tolerance appears to remain even after the relative reversal of other generalized immunoregulatory defects.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the human IL-6 gene in EBV-immortalized normal human B lymphocytes following retroviral-mediated transduction rendered these cells highly tumorigenic in athymic mice. The tumors were lymphomas composed of the originally inoculated human lymphoblastoid cells. Co-injection of IL-6 expressing EBV-immortalized cells with IL-6 nonexpressing control cells resulted in increased tumorigenicity of the IL-6 nonexpressing cells. The lymphoblastoid cells expressing IL-6 were indistinguishable from parental cell lines in morphology and in a variety of cell surface characteristics, and did not exhibit growth advantage over parental cell lines in vitro, such that increased tumorigenicity is unlikely to depend upon a direct oncogenic effect of IL-6 on the B cells. Rather, at high concentrations, IL-6 markedly inhibits human lymphoblastoid cell killing by IL-2-activated murine splenocytes in vitro, suggesting that IL-6-related tumorigenicity might depend upon IL-6 inhibiting cytotoxicity at the tumor site. Thus, production of IL-6 by tumor cells that results in natural killer cell dysfunctions illustrates a novel mechanism of tumor cell escape from immune surveillance.\r"

In this study, we have shown that a high proportion of B cells enzymatically dissociated from human appendix, a gut-associated lymphoreticular tissue (GALT), expresses the IL-6R, and that recombinant human IL-6 induces significant increases in the number of Ig-producing cells. The recombinant human IL-6-induced increase in Ig-producing cells is restricted to the IgA isotype. Further, IgA2 is the major subclass; however, significant numbers of IgA1 producing cells are also seen. In contrast, human tonsillar and peripheral blood B cells express low levels of IL-6R, and exogenous IL-6 does not increase numbers of Ig-producing cells. When PBMC or tonsillar cells are stimulated with PWM, the former display an equal distribution of IgA1 and IgA2 secreting cells, while tonsillar B cells are mainly of the IgA1 subclass. The distribution of surface Ig-positive (sIg+) B cells in the appendix B cell population is sIgA+ greater than sIgG+ greater than sIgM+, and the sIgA+ B cells express higher levels of IL-6R when compared with sIgG+ or sIgM+ B cells. These studies show that human appendix contains B cell subsets that constitutively express IL-6R, and that a high proportion of these cells are committed to the IgA isotype. Furthermore, higher numbers of IL-6 responsive IgA2 B cells are present in the human appendix as compared to tonsils or PBMC.\r"

This protein had an amino-acid composition similar to that of the type VI collagen alpha-1/alpha-2 chains, was recognized by specific polyclonal antibodies against type VI collagen, and had a similar acidic isoelectric point. Furthermore, we found that purified type VI collagen also bound vWF. Thus, we have identified the extracted 150-kD protein as type VI collagen. This protein may play a significant role in the binding of vWF to vascular subendothelium in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Our present work characterized the role of hormone-mediated signal transduction pathways in regulating hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Cholera toxin, dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP), and glucagon inhibited GSH synthesis in cultured hepatocytes by 25-43%. Cellular cAMP levels exhibited a lower threshold for stimulation of the GSH efflux than inhibition of its synthesis. The effect of DBcAMP was independent of the type of sulfur amino acid precursor and cellular ATP levels and unassociated with increased GSH mixed disulfide formation or altered GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio. In liver cytosols, addition of DBcAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) inhibited GSH synthesis from substrates (cysteine, ATP, glutamate, and glycine) by approximately 20% which was prevented by the A-kinase inhibitor. However, if only substrates of the second step in GSH synthesis were used (gamma-glutamylcysteine, glycine, and ATP), DBcAMP and A-kinase exerted no inhibitory effect. Phenylephrine, vasopressin, and phorbol ester also inhibited GSH synthesis in cultured cells by approximately 20%, and depleted cell GSH independent of the type of sulfur amino acid precursor. Cellular cysteine level was unchanged despite the significant fall in GSH after glucagon or phenylephrine treatment. Pretreatment with either staurosporine, C-kinase inhibitor, or calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, partially prevented but, together, completely prevented the inhibitory effect of phenylephrine. The same combination had no effect on the inhibitory effect of glucagon. The effects of hormones were confirmed in both the intact perfused liver and after in vivo administration. Thus, two classes of hormones acting through distinct signal transduction pathways may down-regulate hepatic GSH synthesis by phosphorylation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.\r"

Before insulin, leucine and phenylalanine release exceeded uptake (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.07, respectively). A net output of alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) was also observed. During insulin, arterial plasma leucine, KIC and phenylalanine concentrations decreased (P less than 0.05 or less vs. basal), despite ongoing net output of these substrates by the forearm, that persisted after correction for the mean transit time spent through the extracellular muscular space. By the end of insulin, whole-body leucine and phenylalanine concentrations and rate of appearance were decreased (P less than 0.01 vs. basal). However, release and uptake of both amino acids by the forearm were not significantly decreased vs. the preinsulin values. These data indicate that systemic hyperinsulinemia acutely decreases plasma amino acid concentrations by acting primarily at sites other than skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Apolipoprotein (apo) E and the two B apolipoproteins, apoB48 and apoB100, are important proteins in human lipoprotein metabolism. Commonly occurring polymorphisms in the genes for apoE and apoB result in amino acid substitutions that produce readily detectable phenotypic differences in these proteins. We studied changes in apoE and apoB phenotypes before and after liver transplantation to gain new insights into apolipoprotein physiology. In all 29 patients that we studied, the postoperative serum apoE phenotype of the recipient, as assessed by isoelectric focusing, converted virtually completely to that of the donor, providing evidence that greater than 90% of the apoE in the plasma is synthesized by the liver. In contrast, the cerebrospinal fluid apoE phenotype did not change to the donor's phenotype after liver transplantation, indicating that most of the apoE in CSF cannot be derived from the plasma pool and therefore must be synthesized locally. The apoB100 phenotype (assessed with immunoassays using monoclonal antibody MB19, an antibody that detects a two-allele polymorphism in apoB) invariably converted to the phenotype of the donor. In four normolipidemic patients, we determined the MB19 phenotype of both the apoB100 and apoB48 in the \"chylomicron fraction\" isolated from plasma 3 h after a fat-rich meal. Interestingly, the apoB100 in the chylomicron fraction invariably had the phenotype of the donor, indicating that the vast majority of the large, triglyceride-rich apoB100-containing lipoproteins that appear in the plasma after a fat-rich meal are actually VLDL of hepatic origin. The MB19 phenotype of the apoB48 in the plasma chylomicron fraction did not change after liver transplantation, indicating that almost all of the apoB48 in plasma chylomicrons is derived from the intestine. These results were consistent with our immunocytochemical studies on intestinal biopsy specimens of organ donors; using apoB-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found evidence for apoB48, but not apoB100, in donor intestinal biopsy specimens.\r"

We report the case of a 40-yr-old patient who developed a potent thrombin inhibitor revealed by mild bleeding symptoms and marked prolongation of most laboratory clotting times. After two years of evolution, he died from cerebral hemorrhage. The inhibitor, a polyclonal IgG, was associated with hematological and immunological criteria of autoimmune disorder. Antithrombin IgG was isolated from the patient's plasma by protein A- and thrombin-affinity chromatography. Fab fragments inhibited amidolytic activity of alpha thrombin, and thrombin-thrombomodulin catalyzed protein C activation with a Ki of approximately 10(-8) M in a noncompetitive manner. Alpha to gamma conversion of thrombin resulted in a moderate loss of affinity for the inhibitor. Upon complex formation of thrombin with staphylocoagulase or alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), inhibition was decreased by two orders of magnitude and acquired an apparent competitive character. In Western blot experiments, the antibody reacted with active alpha-thrombin, did not react with chloromethylketone-inhibited thrombin and reacted with a lower affinity with iPr2P-thrombin. The inhibitor did not block thrombin binding to benzamidine-, heparin-, or fibrin-Sepharose, but displaced proflavin from its complex with thrombin. Taken together, these results indicate that the patient's autoantibody recognized a conformational structure which includes, at least in part, the apolar binding site adjacent to the catalytic site of thrombin.\r"

  ".W": "Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as \"idiogenic osmoles\" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis.\r"

In tissue culture, ET causes smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and contraction by influx of extracellular calcium, which is inhibited by calcium channel antagonists. Infusion of cyclosporine (CSA) hemodynamically parallels ET action, and knowing that CSA effects EC, we hypothesize that the vasoconstrictive effects of CSA are a result of ET synthesis by EC. Varying concentrations of CSA were incubated with EC resulting in ET present in the supernatants in a dose-dependent manner peaking at 75% above basal activity. Coincubation of either cremophor alone or cycloheximide with CSA resulted in minimal ET present in the EC supernatants (P less than 0.01 each). Incubation of conditioned media from CSA-treated EC with SMC caused proliferation at 114% above basal activity, which did not occur in the presence of CSA alone (P less than 0.01). This activity is specifically inhibited in the presence of an anti-ET antibody or nonspecifically in the presence of calcium channel antagonists (P less than 0.01 each). Therefore, CSA stimulates EC synthesis of ET which in turn causes SMC proliferation. This action is inhibited by the coincubation of a specific antibody to ET or a calcium channel antagonist. These findings may help in the understanding of CSA-induced hypertension and vasculopathy.\r"

Little is known in man, except that both isogenes were found to be coexpressed in three adult ventricles. In this report, we investigated the isoactin mRNA composition in ventricles from 21 control patients (4 fetal, 5 juvenile, 12 adult) and from 15 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (5 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies, 5 ischemic myopathies with myocardial infarcts, 5 diverse etiologies) by two different and complementary techniques: RNA dot blot analysis with specific cDNA probes, and primer extensions with an oligonucleotide common to alpha-cardiac and alpha-skeletal actins. In the case of dot blot analysis, quantification of each isoform was performed by using as standards RNA transcripts obtained from cloned human alpha-actin sequences, and the total amount of sarcomeric actin mRNA was evaluated as a function of total poly(A+)RNA. We found that both isogenes are always coexpressed, and that the isoactin pattern changes during development. In utero and in neonatal hearts, alpha-skeletal actin mRNA represents less than or equal to 20% of sarcomeric actins, it increases to 48 +/- 6% during the first decade after birth and becomes the predominant isoform of adult hearts (60.4 +/- 8.5%). The 15 adult failing hearts exhibited the same isoactin pattern as the control ones (62.84 +/- 11.06%), and there was no difference in expression between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease. These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the skeletal actin gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the actin and myosin heavy chain families are independently regulated in human heart.\r"

Gross. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:7295-7303; and Hazen, S. L., D. A. Ford, and R. W. Gross. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266:5629-5633). To examine the potential role of these calcium-independent phospholipases A2 in mediating membrane dysfunction during early myocardial ischemia, the temporal course of alterations in phospholipase A2 activity during global ischemia in Langendorf perfused rabbit hearts was quantified and compared with traditionally accepted markers of myocytic ischemic injury and anaerobic metabolism. We now report that membrane-associated calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity increased over 400% during 2 min of global ischemia (P less than 0.01), was near maximally activated (greater than 10-fold) after only 5 min of ischemia, and remained activated throughout the entire ischemic interval examined (2-60 min). Activation of membrane-associated plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 after 5 min of myocardial ischemia was rapidly reversible during reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Both the activation of phospholipase A2 and its reversibility during reperfusion were temporally correlated to alterations in myocytic anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, activation of membrane-associated phospholipase A2 was essentially complete before electron microscopic evidence of cellular damage. Collectively, these results identify dynamic alterations in calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity during myocardial ischemia which precede irreversible cellular injury and demonstrate that activation of plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 is amongst the earliest biochemical alterations in ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relative effects of thyrotropin (TSH) and TSH receptor autoantibodies in the sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease on three TSH-lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor extracellular domain chimeras. Each chimera binds TSH with high affinity. Only the chimera with TSH receptor extracellular domains ABC (amino acids 1-260) had a functional (cAMP) response to thyroid stimulatory IgG. The chimeras with TSH receptor domains CD (amino acids 171-360) and DE (amino acids 261-418) were unresponsive. The lack of response of the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE was anticipated because it fails to transduce a signal with TSH stimulation, unlike the other two chimeras. A different spectrum of responses occurred when the TSH-LH/CG chimeras were examined in terms of autoantibody competition for TSH binding. IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity when tested with the wild-type TSH receptor also inhibited TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE. Dramatically, however, these IgG did not inhibit TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains CD, and had weak or absent activity with the chimera with TSH receptor domains ABC. Chimeras with TSH receptor domains ABC and DE were equally effective in affinity-purifying IgG with thyroid-stimulatory and TSH binding-inhibitory activities. Nonstimulatory IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity inhibited the action of stimulatory IgG on the wild-type TSH receptor, but not with the chimera containing TSH receptor domains ABC. In summary, TSH receptor autoantibodies and TSH bind to regions in both domains ABC and DE of the TSH receptor extracellular region. Stimulatory and inhibitory TSH receptor autoantibodies, as well as TSH, appear to bind to different sites in domains ABC, but similar sites in domains DE, of the receptor. Alternatively, TSH and the different TSH receptor antibodies bind with differing affinities to the same site in the ABC region.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a peptide secreted by macrophages in response to endotoxin that can produce many of the changes seen in septic shock. After cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rats gradually develop tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypothermia. At 5 h post-CLP, rats have a peak in serum levels of endotoxin and 60% of rats have blood cultures that grow Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia). At 20 h post-CLP all rats develop positive blood cultures. Serum levels of TNF are not reproducibly measurable in rats following CLP. Rats undergoing CLP have a 50-80% mortality with deaths usually occurring 24-72 h postinjury. Repetitive (twice daily x 6 d) i.p. injection of sublethal doses of recombinant human TNF-alpha (100 micrograms/kg) to rats undergoing CLP 1 d after the treatment period resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to control rats previously unexposed to rTNF (P less than 0.03). Animals treated with rTNF had no hypotension or hypothermia after CLP and regained normal food intake faster than control rats. 12 h after CLP the gene expression for manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an inducible mitochondrial metalloenzyme responsible for cellular resistance to injury from toxic reactive oxygen species, was higher in livers of rats treated with rTNF suggesting that the TNF treatment augmented expression of this protective enzyme. Unlike MnSOD, expression of the gene for copper-zinc SOD was not affected by CLP or rTNF treatment. The results suggest that prior treatment with recombinant TNF can ameliorate the lethality, hypotension, hypothermia, and anorexia of Gram-negative sepsis in rats and that the mechanism may be related to enhanced hepatic expression of the gene for MnSOD. Repeated administration of recombinant TNF may be a strategy to minimize mortality and morbidity of Gram-negative sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The gene encoding a novel protein designated nm23-H1, which was recently identified as identical to the A subunit of nucleotide diphosphate kinase from human erythrocytes, has been proposed to play a role in tumor metastasis suppression. We report that untreated neuroblastoma tumors contain a cellular polypeptide (Mr = 19,000) designated p19, identified in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels, which occurs at significantly higher levels (P = 0.0001) in primary tumors containing amplified N-myc gene. The partial amino acid sequence obtained for p19 is identical to the sequence of the human nm23-H1 protein. An antibody to the A subunit of erythrocyte nucleotide diphosphate kinase reacted exclusively with p19. In this study, significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 occurred in primary neuroblastoma tumors from patients with advanced stages (III and IV) relative to tumors from patients with limited stages (I and II) of the disease. Even among patients with a single copy of the N-myc gene, tumors from patients with stages III and IV had statistically significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 than tumors from patients with stages I and II. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to a proposed role for nm23-H1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor, increased p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma is correlated with features of the disease that are associated with aggressive tumors. Therefore, nm23-H1 may have distinct if not opposite roles in different tumors.\r"

Under both these experimental conditions, the great majority of PPD-specific TCC secreted IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not, or limited amounts of, IL-4 and IL-5. In contrast, most TES-specific TCC secreted IL-4 and IL-5 but not, or limited amounts of, IL-2 and IFN-gamma. PPD-specific TCC that failed to secrete IL-4 and IL-5, and TES-specific TCC that failed to secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were found to lack transcripts for IL-4 and IL-5, or for IL-2 and IFN-gamma, respectively. During the course of the study, over a 6-mo period, the functional phenotype of both TES- and PPD-specific TCC was repeatedly assessed and remained constant. These data demonstrate that T cells with stable Th1 or Th2 functional pattern exist not only in mice but also in humans and suggest that in the course of natural immunization certain infectious agents preferentially expand T cell subsets with stable and definite profile of cytokine production.\r"

  ".W": "Chloroquine and ammonium chloride, by virtue of their basic properties, have been shown to raise endocytic and lysosomal pH and thereby interfere with normal iron metabolism in a variety of cell types, including mononuclear phagocytes. Cellular iron metabolism is of critical importance to Legionella pneumophila, an intracellular bacterial pathogen whose capacity to multiply in human mononuclear phagocytes is dependent upon the availability of intracellular iron. In view of this, we have studied the effects of chloroquine and ammonium chloride on L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication in human monocytes. Chloroquine, at a concentration of 20 microM, and ammonium chloride, at a concentration of 20 mM, inhibited L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication by 1.4 +/- 0.2 (SEM) logs and 1.5 +/- 0.2 logs, respectively. Chloroquine- and ammonium chloride-induced inhibition of L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication was completely reversed by iron nitrilotriacetate, an iron compound which is soluble in the neutral to alkaline pH range, but not by iron transferrin, which depends upon acidic intracellular conditions to release iron. Chloroquine had no major direct effect on L. pneumophila multiplication in artificial media except at extremely high concentrations (15,000-fold that which inhibited L. pneumophila multiplication in mononuclear phagocytes), and inhibition at such concentrations was not reversed by iron nitrilotriacetate. This study demonstrates that chloroquine and ammonium chloride inhibit the intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila by limiting the availability of iron to the bacterium. It is possible that such a mechanism of action underlies chloroquine's antimicrobial effect against other intracellular pathogens, such as the agents of malaria and tuberculosis.\r"

This study was performed to determine whether this antiinflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is mediated by the tachykinin-degrading enzymes neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE). In addition, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on a nonpeptide inflammatory mediator, platelet-activating factor (PAF), which is not degraded by NEP or ACE. Adult male pathogen-free F344 rats were treated for 2 d with dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg per d i.p.), or with the vehicle used to dissolve the steroid. The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by an intravenous injection of substance P (5 micrograms/kg) or PAF (10 micrograms/kg) was then assessed by using Monastral blue pigment as an intravascular tracer. The role of NEP and ACE activities in the changes produced by dexamethasone was investigated by examining the effect of the selective inhibitors of these enzymes, phosphoramidon and captopril. Dexamethasone reduced the substance P-induced extravasation by 57% but did not affect the PAF-induced extravasation. The suppressive effect of dexamethasone on substance P-induced extravasation was completely reversed by simultaneously inhibiting NEP and ACE activities, but the inhibition of these enzymes had no effect on PAF-induced extravasation, regardless of whether the rats were pretreated with dexamethasone or not. These results suggest that NEP and ACE mediate a selective inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on neurogenic plasma extravasation.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemia may cause increased or decreased distensibility of the left ventricle, but the cellular mechanisms involved have not been clarified. We examined the possible contributions of changes in intracellular inorganic phosphate, pH, and Ca2+ concentrations to altered diastolic function in cultured myocytes subjected to partial metabolic inhibition. Paced cultured embryonic chick and adult rabbit ventricular myocytes superfused with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) exhibited an increase in end-diastolic intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and an upward shift in end-diastolic cell position. These results indicate that glycolytic blockade increases diastolic and systolic calcium in paced ventricular myocytes, and that this elevated diastolic calcium influences the extent of diastolic relaxation. In contrast, paced ventricular myocytes superfused with 1 mM cyanide (CN) exhibited a similar increase in end-diastolic [Ca2+]i but a decrease in end-diastolic cell position and amplitude of motion. Although changes in ATP contents were similar in both groups (2DG, -29.9%; CN, -40.1%), alterations of intracellular pH and inorganic phosphate concentrations were different. In 2DG-treated cells, pHi did not decrease significantly (7.18 +/- 0.04 to 7.12 +/- 0.11, n = 14) but in the CN group it decreased markedly within 6 min (7.18 +/- 0.04 to 6.76 +/- 0.11, n = 11, P less than 0.01). Intracellular inorganic phosphate decreased slightly in the 2DG group (-14.8%, NS) but increased in cells exposed to CN (45.7%, P less than 0.02). We conclude that while a prominent increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i occurs in rapidly paced ventricular myocytes exposed to either inhibitors of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, the effects of this increase in [Ca2+]i on diastolic distensibility may be influenced by intracellular accumulation of metabolites that decrease the sensitivity of myofilament to [Ca2+]i.\r"

In this work, using bone histomorphometry (including histoenzymologic and kinetic studies for the first time), we have evaluated the bone remodeling (i.e., bone resorption and bone formation rates) of 16 individuals with early MM in comparison with that of 10 with benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) and that of 17 patients with previously untreated overt MM. A significantly increased osteoblastic recruitment was observed in the individuals with early MM when compared with those with BMG (P less than 0.01). A significant (P less than 0.01) increased bone resorption (i.e., eroded surfaces, osteoclast numbers and surfaces) was observed from the early stage of MM in comparison with the BMG status where bone resorption remained within the normal range. At the tissue level, there was no difference in terms of bone resorption between early and overt MM. On the other hand, osteoblast activity was significantly reduced in patients with overt MM (P less than 0.05 by comparison with those with early MM). A significant enhancement of osteoblastic recruitment with an increased generation of new osteoclasts is an early critical event in the pathogenesis of human MM. Of particular importance is the early stimulation of osteoblasts, since these cells produce high amounts of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor and a critical cytokine for the formation of osteoclasts in the bone marrow.\r"

  ".W": "Resting natural killer (NK) cells express the p75 chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R beta) and most NK cells express the CD2 (erythrocyte rosette) receptor. The cell adhesion molecule, LFA-3, is a natural co-ligand for CD2. Tac antigen (IL-2R alpha), a p55 IL-2R subunit, can be expressed after NK activation and may play a role in IL-2-induced NK proliferation. Little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine production in NK cells. We investigated the roles of IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, and CD2/LFA-3 in the molecular regulation of NK cell granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production. Enriched populations of peripheral blood NK cells were separated into CD16-positive and CD16-negative fractions by flow cytometry; positively selected cells were greater than 97% positive for CD16 (the FcIII receptor for IgG which is present on almost all NK cells), less than 1% positive for the T cell antigen CD3, and did not demonstrate rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta chain gene by Southern blot. NK cell supernatants were harvested after 3-4 d of incubation with 0-100 U/ml IL-2, or after incubation with anti-CD2 (T11(3] MAb and sheep red blood cells (SRBC are a homologue for LFA-3). Parallel cell aliquots were harvested at 3-16 h for transcriptional run-on assays, S1 nuclease assays, and actinomycin D mRNA t1/2 determinations. IL-2-activated NK supernatants contained large amounts of GM-CSF (178 +/- 35 pg/ml) by ELISA as did supernatants from CD2-activated NK cells (T11(3) MAb + SRBC: 212 +/- 42) vs. less than 20 pg/ml for NK cells incubated alone or with either SRBC or T11(3) MAb alone. Sepharose-linked anti-CD3 MAb did not induce GM-CSF release from NK cells. By S1 analysis, both IL-2 and CD2 stimulation markedly augmented GM-CSF mRNA expression but with very different latencies of onset. IL-2R beta MAb inhibited greater than 85% of GM-CSF release from IL-2-activated NK cells and markedly suppressed IL-2-induced GM-CSF mRNA expression, whereas IL-2R alpha MAb even at 2,000-fold molar excess of IL-2 had little effect (less than 10%) on either GM-CSF release or mRNA expression. Run-on assays showed that GM-CSF is constitutively transcribed in NK cells and that IL-2 and CD2-activated cells had a three- to fourfold increased rate of GM-CSF transcription compared to nonstimulated cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The molecular defect responsible for the shortened beta-spectrin chain variant, spectrin Rouen, was identified by analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA of affected individuals after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Peripheral blood reticulocyte RNA was transcribed into cDNA and amplified using primers corresponding to the 3' end of beta-spectrin cDNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNA amplification products from affected individuals revealed the expected band of 391 bp as well as a shortened band of 341 bp. Nucleotide sequencing of the shortened cDNA amplification product revealed that the sequences corresponding to the penultimate exon of the beta-spectrin gene (exon Y) were absent. This result was confirmed by hybridization of a Southern blot of amplification products with a labeled probe specific for exon Y. Nucleotide sequencing of the proband's amplified genomic DNA corresponding to this region of the beta-spectrin gene revealed a mutation in the 5' donor consensus splice site of the intron downstream of the Y exon, TGG/GTGAGT to TGG/GTTAGT, in one allele. We postulate that this mutation leads to the splicing out or skipping of exon Y, thus producing a shortened beta-spectrin chain. To our knowledge, this is the first documented example of exon skipping as the cause of a shortened beta-spectrin chain in a case of hereditary elliptocytosis. The exon skip results in the loss of the 17 amino acids of exon Y and creates a frameshift with the synthesis of 33 novel amino acids prior to premature chain termination 14 residues upstream of the normal carboxy terminus of the beta-spectrin chain, giving a mutant beta-spectrin chain that is 31 amino acids shorter than the normal chain.\r"

The mutant was compared with the wild-type predecessor as well as with a motile back-revertant of the same genetic background. The mutant lacked, by morphologic, biochemical, and immunologic criteria, the major structural protein of flagella, flagellin. This mutation was not associated with major DNA rearrangements or with failure of transcription. An apparent consequence of a loss of flagella was reduced ability to penetrate human endothelial cell layers in vitro. In another assessment of functional significance, the flagella-less mutant was equal if not superior to flagella-bearing, isogenic isolates when examined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies in the sera of Lyme disease patients. These studies of a mutant, the first among pathogenic Borrelia spp. to be characterized, indicate that the flagellum and motility it confers play a role in B. burgdorferi's invasion of human tissues. A flagella-less B. burgdorferi may be useful as the basis of a more specific immunoassay and a vaccine for protection against Lyme disease.\r"

Leukocyte/endothelium interaction was assessed in the time course after intravenous injection of native human LDL (4 mg/kg body wt) and of oxLDL (7.5 microM Cu++, 6 h, 37 degrees C) into control hamsters and into hamsters, pretreated with the selective leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 (20 mumol/kg, i.v.). While no effect was seen after injection of native LDL, oxLDL elicited an immediate induction of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium of arterioles and postcapillary venules. Total and differential leukocyte counts suggest that all leukocyte subsets were likewise affected by oxLDL with no specific preference for monocytes. Stimulation of leukocyte adhesion was entirely prevented in inhibitor-treated animals, suggesting the important mediator role of leukotrienes in oxLDL-induced leukocyte/endothelium interaction.\r"

We investigated whether similar membrane-active events occur during defensin-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells. Although defensin-treated K562 targets did not release chromium-labeled cytoplasmic components for 5-6 h, they experienced a rapid collapse (within minutes) of the membrane potential, efflux of rubidium, and influx of trypan blue. Defensin treatment also blunted the subsequent acidification response induced by nigericin, thereby further supporting the notion of enhanced transmembrane ion flow during exposure. These initial effects on the plasma membrane were not sufficient for subsequent lysis; a second phase of injury was required which involved the continued presence of defensin. The rapid membrane permeabilization phase was inhibited by azide/2-deoxyglucose, cytochalasin B, and increased concentrations of extracellular potassium and was unaffected by actinomycin-D, cycloheximide, and varying the calcium concentration. In contrast, the second phase was unaffected by cytochalasin B, inhibited by azide/2-deoxyglucose, enhanced by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, and varied with calcium concentration. These results indicate the initial adverse effect of defensins on mammalian cells occurs at the cell membrane. It is possible that the second phase of injury is mediated intracellularly by defensin that has been internalized through this leaky membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes are a potent source of a variety of cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In this study, we have shown that ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation augments GM-CSF mRNA expression by murine keratinocytes. This is reflected in the increased production of GM-CSF protein by these cells. In the same cell population, exposure to UVB irradiation increases interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) mRNA and IL-1 protein as detected by bioactivity. This increase in IL-1 alpha precedes the increase of GM-CSF mRNA. Addition of recombinant IL-1 alpha to the medium increases GM-CSF mRNA expression. Anti-IL-1 alpha antibodies can completely inhibit UV-augmented GM-CSF mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that UVB irradiation-induced augmentation of GM-CSF is mediated by UV-induced IL-1 alpha.\r"

A platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, BN 52063, or the anti-inflammatory drug, betamethasone, applied topically or injected subcutaneously, inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the antigen-induced increase in ear thickness observed after 24 h. In addition, BN 52063 and betamethasone presented a synergistic effect when administered in vivo simultaneously and subcutaneously. Indomethacin administered subcutaneously at the time of the antigen challenge significantly potentiated the early swelling phase and inhibited the late one. In contrast, the inhibitors of histamine and serotonin, ketotifen and methysergide, respectively, modulated mostly the early, and to a lower extent the late phase when administered at the time of antigen challenge. In contrast, none of these drugs inhibited the late phase reaction when administered 4 h after the antigen. A significant eosinophil and mononuclear-cell ear infiltrate was observed following topical application of the antigen, a phenomenon that was markedly reduced by either BN 52063 or betamethasone. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF antagonists, either alone or in association with glucocorticosteroids, in experimental CD, the modulation of the infiltration of eosinophils and mononuclear cells possibly explaining part of the inhibitory action of these drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian epithelium is a tissue with a very high turnover rate. It consists of a rapidly proliferating compartment comprising basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, from which cells move upwards while differentiating into granular keratinocytes. The end product is shed as an enucleate corneocyte, which has a mechanically rigid, chemically resistant cross-linked keratinous envelope. The loss of the nucleus occurs specifically in the granular keratinocyte layer; here, cells with the classical apoptotic morphology of clumped and marginated condensed chromatin may be observed. This morphology is characteristic of \"programmed\" cell death in other systems, of which the lymphocyte has been most extensively studied, and is associated with the cleavage of nuclear DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments. In the present investigation we separated newborn mouse skin into basal and granular keratinocyte fractions and examined the state of the DNA in each fraction. Our results indicate that cells in the basal layer, while their DNA is perfectly intact, are preparing to die. DNA fragmentation is initiated in the granular keratinocyte layer and is identical in pattern to that seen in other examples of programmed cell death.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the radical mechanism of lipid peroxidation induced by ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation, an electron spin resonance (ESR) study was made on epidermal homogenate prepared from albino rat skin. The exposure of the homogenate to UV light resulted in an increase in lipid peroxide content, which was proportional to the time of UV exposure. Using ESR spin trapping (dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, DMPO), the DMPO spin adduct spectrum of lipid radicals (L.) was measured following UV exposure (DMPO-L.:aN = 15.5 G, aH = 22.7 G), as was the spectrum of DMPO-hydroxyl radical (DMPO-OH, aN = aH = 15.5 G). In the presence of superoxide dismutase, the DMPO spin adduct spectrum of lipid radicals was found to be reduced remarkably. Therefore, it was shown that the generation of the lipid radicals partially involves superoxide anion radicals, in addition to hydroxyl radicals. In the ESR free-radical experiment, an ESR signal appeared at g = 2.0064 when the ESR tube filled with homogenate was exposed to UV light at -150 degrees C. The temperature-dependent change in the ESR free radical signal of homogenate exposed to UV light was observed at temperatures varying from -150 degrees C to room temperature. By using degassed samples, it was confirmed that oxygen is involved in the formation of the lipid peroxide radicals (LOO.) from the lipid radicals (L.).\r"

  ".W": "If in vivo magnetic resonance imaging is nowadays a powerful non-invasive method in medical diagnosis, its application in order to study the skin in vivo is not yet in common use because skin imaging requires a high resolution, at least in the direction perpendicular to the skin surface. We have therefore designed a specific imaging module, which, connected to a standard whole-body imager at 1.5 Tesla, allows us to obtain in vivo magnetic resonance images of skin on most parts of the body. With a depth resolution of about 70 microns, we are able to differentiate the skin layers: epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, and even a thickened stratum corneum on palm as well as on heel. This paper reports the T1 and T2 water proton relaxation times of the different skin layers, in vivo, which are magnetic resonance parameters extracted from the images. Results show that skin layers are characterized by shorter T2 relaxation times than other biologic soft tissues. On the contrary, the measured T1 values are in the same range as in other tissues. These short T2 values may be assigned to the fibrous protein content of the skin and particularly of the dermis. This study on normal skin is the precursor of further works such as the influence of aging. As regards skin pathologies, it will be a powerful tool to follow the evolution of skin diseases under treatment.\r"

Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-1000 of HA purified by HPLC showed a large proportion of the newly synthesized HA to be of a very high molecular mass (greater than 2 X 10(6) Da) in both epidermis and dermis, whereas HA in the medium was of a smaller size. After 24 h chase, most of the high molecular mass HA, and 42-48% of total labeled HA disappeared from both tissue compartments. The size of labeled HA recovered in the chase media was further reduced but the content roughly corresponded to that lost from tissue. The amount of unlabeled HA was not significantly altered in epidermis, whereas in dermis it was reduced to about 10% of the initial values during 5-d culture. The results demonstrate that HA of both epidermis and dermis is synthesized as a very high molecular mass compound but rapidly undergoes a limited degradation into large fragments. The fragmentation of HA is suggested to enhance its diffusion from the tissues, particularly dermis.\r"

Potential mechanisms of human tattoo pigment lightening with Q-switched ruby laser were explored by light and electron microscopy. Significant variation existed between and within tattoos. Electron microscopy of untreated tattoos revealed membrane-bound pigment granules, predominantly within fibroblasts and macrophages, and occasionally in mast cells. These granules contained pigment particles ranging from 2-in diameter. Immediately after exposure, dose-related injury was observed in cells containing pigment. Some pigment particles were smaller and lamellated. At fluences greater than or equal to 3 J/cm2, dermal vacuoles and homogenization of collagen bundles immediately adjacent to extracellular pigment were occasionally observed. A brisk neutrophilic infiltrate was apparent by 24 h. Eleven days later, the pigment was again intracellular. Half of the biopsies at 150 d revealed a mild persistent lymphocytic infiltrate. There was no fibrosis except for one case of clinical scarring. These findings confirm that short-pulse radiation can be used to selectively disrupt cells containing tattoo pigments. The physial alteration of pigment granules, redistribution, and elimination appear to account for clinical lightening of the tattoos.\r"

  ".W": "In normal human skin, basal layer keratinocytes of the epidermis are intimately associated with the lamina lucida of the basement membrane. Laminin, which is an 850-kD glycoprotein that has a cruciform shape by rotary shadowing and electron microscopy, is localized to the lamina lucida. The present study was aimed at further characterizing the interaction between laminin and cultured human keratinocytes. Initial studies revealed that laminin-coated substrata significantly promoted keratinocyte attachment in a concentration-dependent manner. To further define keratinocyte binding regions within laminin, a 440-kD proteolytic fragment of laminin was generated by limited chymotrypsin digestion, which renders laminin devoid of all terminal globular domains. Substrata coated with this 440-kD laminin fragment did not promote keratinocyte adhesion, suggesting that the globular domains may play an important role in cell adhesion. Based on these experiments, a series of chemically synthesized peptides derived from the A or B1 chains of laminin were studied. Among these, three peptides were found to be active in directly promoting keratinocyte adhesion: peptide F-9 (RYVVLPRPVCFEK) from the inner globule of the human B1 chain, TG-1 (RPVRHAQCRVCDGNSTNPRERH) from the top globule of the amino terminus (short arm) of the A chain, and GD-6 (KQNCLSSRASFRGCVRNLRLSR) from the large carboxy terminal globule at the end of the long arm of the A chain. In competition assays, these peptides in solution were shown to inhibit laminin-mediated keratinocyte adhesion. These studies show that normal human keratinocytes bind directly to laminin at a minimum of three distinct sites.\r"

Treatment with T4N5 liposomes containing a DNA repair enzyme enhanced repair synthesis in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum keratinocytes in an irradiation- and liposome-dose dependent manner. These results provide no evidence that aging people or skin cancer patients are predisposed to cutaneous malignancy by a DNA repair deficiency, but do demonstrate that T4N5 liposomes enhance DNA repair in the keratinocytes of the susceptible xeroderma pigmentosum and skin cancer population.\r"

Expression of growth factor genes was constitutive because prior to RNA extraction melanoma cells were maintained in a chemically defined culture medium free of exogenous growth factors. Each of four cell lines had an individual pattern of expression of either two, four, five, or seven growth factors; however, all cell lines shared expression of the bFGF gene. Two strains of normal melanocytes expressed TGF- beta 1 but not bFGF, PDGF, TGF- alpha , or MGSA mRNA at detectable levels. We tested growth-modulatory effects of the growth factors most frequently expressed by melanoma cells (bFGF, TGF- alpha, TGF- beta, PDGF). None of these stimulated melanoma cell growth consistently, whereas exogenous, acid-activated TGF- beta inhibited melanoma growth at concentrations greater than 10 ng/ml, suggesting that bioactive TGF- beta may represent a physiologic growth inhibitor. Neither neutralizing antisera to PDGF or TGF- alpha nor a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor inhibited melanoma cell growth. Our results indicate that multiple growth factors are expressed simultaneously and constitutively by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes in culture. Expression of bFGF is a common feature underscoring the significance of bFGF as an autocrine factor for melanoma cells as described earlier. Secreted PDGF and TGF- alpha are apparently not involved in or not essential for autocrine growth stimulation of melanoma cells.\r"

Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study IL-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant IL-6 activity was measured using an IL-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). Compared to controls and atopics, PBMC of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active IL-6. These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against IL-6. Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for IL-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating IL-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls. In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for IL-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, IL-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes. These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of IL-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.\r"

In contrast, there is little data known about the cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) antigen. No differences between CP and BP have been reported when sera of patients were studied by Western immunoblotting. Findings of a study of sera from 8 patients with CP by indirect immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) on normal human skin are reported. Saponin (0.1% 10 mn) was used as a permeabilizing agent of cytomembranes and saponin-treated skin samples were compared to saponin-untreated skin samples. Four sera from patients with BP, one from a patient with EBA, and three from healthy donors served as controls. The CP sera produced a similar staining of DEJ on both saponin-treated and saponin-untreated skin samples: immune deposits were localized over the lamina densa and the lower part of the lamina lucida clearly separated from the cytoplasmic membrane of keratinocytes, in regularly spaced clumps. The BP sera produced an intense staining of DEJ only on saponin-treated skin samples: immune deposits were observed on the cytoplasmic attachment plaque of the HD; on saponin-untreated skin samples, BP sera produced only a faint staining of the extracellular part of HD. Finally, as expected the EBA serum appeared on the lower part of the lamina densa and anchoring fibrils, and no DAB deposits were observed with the serum of healthy donors. This data indicated that CP antigen is different than BP antigen by its exclusive extracellular localization. It may be a component of anchoring filaments.\r"

  ".W": "Enhanced wound healing is elicited by exogenous administration of transforming growth factor- beta 1 (TGF- beta 1) in split-thickness, excisional wounds in the pig (Quaglino, Lab Invest 63:307-319, 1990). A study was designed to investigate if the selective and localized effects of TGF-beta 1 found in the previous model were dependent upon the type of wound or could be considered a more general effect of the cytokine. Transdermal, sutured incisions in the pig were evaluated by conventional histology and by in situ hybridization to reveal locally affected gene expression of collagen, elastin, fibronectin, stromelysin, TGF- beta 1, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Granulation tissue formation was markedly enhanced at 6 d by a single injection of recombinant human TGF beta 1 at the time of wound closure. Although granulation tissue was confined within the margins of the incisional wound, prominent differences in hybridization signals were observed between control and treated wounds. The stimulatory effect of TGF- beta 1 on granulation tissue formation was accompanied by a distinct enhancement in cells expressing mRNA for several different extracellular matrix proteins including collagens type I and III and elastin, whereas a single injection of human recombinant TGF beta 1 (4 micrograms) at the wound site diminished the expression of the neutral metalloprotease, stromelysin, and enhanced the frequency and intensity of cells expressing TGF- beta 1. The data reinforce the concept that TGF- beta 1 can act as a potent, auto-inductive modulator of connective tissue remodeling during the repair process.\r"

  ".W": "Enzymatic deglycosylation of plasma membrane proteoglycans and metabolic inhibition of glycosaminoglycan sulfation were employed as complementary methods to evaluate the effects of reduced cell surface content of functionally intact proteoglycans on the proliferative potential of cells. A Flavobacter heparinum extract, possessing multiple glycosaminoglycan substrate specificities, markedly inhibited the time-dependent expansion of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast and human squamous cell carcinoma monolayers in culture and concurrently reduced the proportion of subconfluent cell populations in S-cell cycle phase by DNA flow-cytometry analysis. This antiproliferative effect was partially reproduced by lyases with heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate monospecificity, alone and in combination. The observed lability of heparan sulfate lyases I and II in serum-containing medium possibly hampered full reproduction of the effects of the multifunctional reagent. Growth inhibition of comparable magnitude was observed when glycosaminoglycan sulfation was metabolically blocked with sodium chlorate. The chlorate anion had its expected effect of substantially reducing sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis by the cells. Following release from serum deprivation, analysis of the progression of synchronized cell populations past the G1 restriction point suggested that in situ digestion with the glycosaminoglycan lyases limited, but did not delay, the numbers of cells entering S phase. These data support the hypothesis that plasma membrane proteoglycans mediate some of the cell-growth-promoting effects of serum factors via their glycosaminoglycan side chains.\r"

  ".W": "Although psoralens plus UVA radiation (320-400 nm) have been widely used for the treatment of dermatologic diseases, the toxic effects of these agents have led investigators to develop new photochemotherapeutic compounds. One such compound is 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen (TMAP), a new bifunctional molecule. The purpose of this study was to examine the immunologic side effects of repeated treatment of C3H mice with TMAP plus UVA radiation. During this treatment, the number of ATPase+, la+, and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells greatly decreased in the treated site, despite the lack of phototoxicity. The reduction in the number of detectable cutaneous immune cells was accompanied by a decrease in the induction of contact hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene applied to the treated skin, an impairment in the antigen-presenting activity of draining lymph node cells, and the presence of suppressor lymphoid cells in the spleen of unresponsive mice. Treatment with UVA radiation alone also reduced the number of ATPase+, Ia+, and Thy-1+ cells in the skin, but did not cause any detectable alterations in immune function. This implies that morphologic alterations in these cells do not necessarily indicate loss of function. Thus, although TMAP in combination with UVA radiation is not overtly phototoxic, it is highly immunosuppressive in mice.\r"

We have used a vibrating probe electrode to reproducibly identify and vectorize site-specific (spatial resolution = 20 microns) ionic flows as they were occurring in hairless mouse skin clamped at clinically relevant current densities. These iontophoretic currents were primarily appendageal, and certain appendages (e.g., small hairs) appeared to carry most of the current. This finding may have important ramifications with respect to irritation, allergic reaction, and electrical current damage in iontophoretic drug delivery. The size and direction of the current vectors could change under certain conditions (e.g., in an unbuffered preparation, where pH changes occurred during the experiment). The vibrating probe can operate in (and is not adversely affected by) the ranges of pH, tonicity, and current required for the study of iontophoretic currents.\r"

Samples were obtained from multiple anatomic sites and stained with anti-CD36, anti-CD1a, and anti-HLA-DR antibody as well as Lag antibody specifically reactive to BG and some vacuoles of human LC. In the first trimester, CD36+ dendritic epidermal cells were identified before the appearance of CD1a+ cells and Lag+ cells. Some of the former co-expressed HLA-DR antigens but not CD1a antigens. In the second trimester, regional variations in LC development were observed. Epidermal LC of palms and soles reached a peak in number in the first trimester but were rarely detected after 18 weeks estimated gestation age (EGA), whereas, in other regions, their number increased with age. In the second trimester, CD1a+ cells and Lag+ cells were also identified in the epidermis, although Lag+ cells appeared later than CD1a+ cells. The Lag+ cells until 17 weeks EGA showed a variety of staining intensities and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that they contained various amounts of Lag-reactive BG. Flow cytometric analysis showed that relative amounts of Lag antigens in LC increased during the second trimester and that fetal LC of 18 weeks EGA expressed the same amounts of HLA-DR, CD1a, and Lag antigens as did adult human LC. In the dermis, in the second trimester, numerous CD36+ cells and HLA-DR+ cells were found, whereas CD1a+ cells and Lag+ cells were rarely detected. Taken together, it is suggested that HLA-DR+ dendritic cells acquire CD1a+ antigens first and then form BG after migration to the epidermis and that fetal LC are phenotypically mature in the second trimester.\r"

  ".W": "In order to better understand the factors regulating disease promotion and activity in psoriasis (PS), we searched for the in situ expression of mRNA for various cytokines in long-standing PS skin lesions. Specific hybridization with a NAP-1/IL-8 anti-sense RNA probe was keratinocyte associated and yielded strong and specific signals exclusively in the upper layers of the lesional epidermis, but not in uninvolved skin from psoriatic patients or normal skin from non-psoriatics. Interestingly, NAP-1/IL-8 transcripts were focally clustered in a spotty pattern predominantly between the tips of elongated papillae, but were absent in the lower epidermal region and the dermal compartment. We consistently failed to detect appreciable numbers of TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 mRNA-containing cells in psoriatic lesions. These results support the notion that IL-8, rather than IL-6, is an important disease-promoting cytokine in PS. In view of the known in vitro and in vivo effects of IL-8, it is conceivable that this substance greatly contributes to the major pathologic changes seen in psoriatic skin, i.e., keratinocyte hyperproliferation and leucocyte infiltration. In this case, local pharmacologic down-regulation of NAP-1/IL-8 activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy in PS.\r"

Twenty-two cases of SLE, six cases of DLE, one case of lupus erythematosus profundus, two cases of lichen planus, and five skin specimens from healthy volunteers were selected for the examination. In the SLE group, further comparative examination of diseased skin and normal skin from the same patient, and of diseased skin in an active stage and a stable stage in the same SLE patient with renal involvement, were carried out. In most of the active SLE cases, protooncogene expression had apparently increased as compared with the expression in the groups of inactive and treated SLE, active DLE, active lichen planus, and those with healthy skin. Even in normal-appearing skin from active SLE without other organic failure, the protooncogenes were not expressed very strongly.\r"

Three-dimensional images of sebaceous glands were reconstructed from their serial histologic sections using a computer-image analysis system. By stereometry, the sebaceous gland volumes gradually increased during the course of treatments with TS and DMSO, whereas the volumes of TD-treated sebaceous glands increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. The acinus number was increased by all the substances, the DMSO-treated sebaceous glands on day 28 showing the largest number of acini. The volumes of individual acini increased until day 28 with TS treatment, whereas with TD and DMSO treatments they increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. Stereographically, each untreated control sebaceous gland was composed of 20-30 pear-shaped acini. On day 28, acini of TS-treated sebaceous glands were swollen and ovoid in shape, DMSO-treated sebaceous glands resembled a bunch of grapes, and acini of TD-treated sebaceous glands were widely scattered and showed globular swelling arising from an elongated tube. Hyperplastic responses of sebaceous glands are quite different according to substances applied topically.\r"

No correlation could be established between the presence of HIV genomic material, the nature (normal-appearing vs. diseased) of the skin specimen studied, and the clinical or biologic severity of HIV infection, as evidenced by the CDC stage classification and the number of peripheral CD4+ cells. It seems, therefore, that the HIV is very frequently present within the skin during the course of HIV infection; however, its precise cellular localization and pathologic significance await further investigation.\r"

Metallothionein was detected immunohistochemically in hair matrix cells of the bulb and cells of the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles, but not in dermal papillae in normal skin in the back of mice. In hyperplastic epidermal tissue, induced by either a phorbol ester tumor promoter or cholera toxin, the basal cells of the interfollicular epidermis stained strongly for metallothionein. Elevated expression of mRNA of the metallothionein gene was also demonstrated when the skin was stimulated by agents that induced hyperplasia. Papillomas produced by two-stage carcinogenesis protocols also stained for metallothionein. These observations suggest that metallothionein is involved in the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes.\r"

The number of anti-CMV antibody-secreting cells was estimated to be 28-176/10(6) PBMC; 30%-65% of the total in vitro antibody production was CMV-specific. This secretion seemed to be independent of in vitro polyclonal B cell activation, in vitro antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation, or in vivo Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell transformation.

Purified teichoic acid from DIC and non-DIC isolates failed to aggregate platelets in vitro, or in vivo in guinea pigs but inhibited the peptidoglycan-induced aggregation in a dose-response manner. These studies suggest that peptidoglycan may mediate S. aureus-induced spontaneous platelet aggregation in vitro and DIC in vivo. The variability among strains of S. aureus to induce DIC and platelet aggregation may depend on the unique composition of their peptidoglycan and perhaps also the extent of exposure or availability of cell wall teichoic acid.\r"

An important factor in the development of such infections is glycocalix, or slime. An in vitro model that mimics intravenous delivery systems in humans was developed. It consisted of a modified Robbins device containing slices of silicone catheters in the removable ports, through which S. epidermidis diluted in 5% dextrose-normal saline with 10% heat-inactivated normal human serum was run, with and without clindamycin and trospectomycin. S. epidermidis was recovered from all catheters in the absence of antibiotics; no growth was detected with antibiotics. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated significant reduction in glycocalix and no visible organisms with all concentrations except 0.5 micrograms/ml trospectomycin and 1 microgram/ml clindamycin; for those, a moderate amount of glycocalix and a few bacteria were seen. Thus, subinhibitory levels of trospectomycin and clindamycin may have a role in the prevention of microbial adherence to vascular catheters.\r"

A combination of the same 69-kDa protein and LPF is approximately 15 times less effective. These data suggest that, surprisingly, the 69-kDa protein in tandem with FHA is the most relevant combination for mouse protection; consequently such a combination may be a more suitable acellular pertussis vaccine candidate than the LPF/FHA combinations, which have never been satisfactorily protective in the mouse test. Preparation of samples of the 69-kDa protein of acceptable protective quality remains difficult. Attempts were made to screen the most suitable batches of the preparations by exploiting some recently discovered properties of the 69-kDa protein: the characteristic chromatofocusing pattern of the protein, the affinity for lymphocytes, and the ability to bind to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. None of these tests was able to replace the mouse intracerebral challenge potency test for final quality assessment.\r"

Repeated immunization of C57BL/6 and C.B-17 mice with any of the three OspA structures resulted in the generation of monospecific hyperimmune sera reactive with both native and recombinant OspA. Upon transfer of immune sera specific for either native OspA (strain B31) or recombinant OspA (strain ZS7) but not of those reactive with the recombinant 41-kDa flagellin-associated antigen, severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were completely protected against infection with strain ZS7. The finding that monoclonal antibodies to OspA and to OspB but not to non-outer surface spirochetal structures such as flagellin, p20, p65, and p70 conferred protection in SCID mice makes OspA (and possibly OspB) a promising candidate vaccine against Lyme disease.\r"

In 9 patients, the ribotype of the cultured P. cepacia remained unchanged throughout the entire period of observation, indicating chronic pulmonary colonization with a single strain. In each of the remaining 3 patients, two genetically distinct strains were detected among serial P. cepacia isolates. No significant change in clinical condition was correlated with the change in identity of the colonizing strain. In control experiments, the stability of strain ribotype was demonstrated among isolated that had been subcultured 100 times in vitro and among isolates recovered from chronically colonized mice. These data demonstrate the utility of ribotype analysis and indicate that most chronically colonized cystic fibrosis patients harbor a single strain of P. cepacia for prolonged periods.\r"

  ".W": "There is some evidence to suggest that microbial growth inhibition may occur in chronic abscesses. A substance perhaps responsible for this phenomenon is calprotectin, a neutrophil cytoplasmic protein that inhibits microbial growth and that belongs to a class of proteins often having specific binding sites for zinc. In the present study, the suppressive effects of either human or mouse neutrophil lysates on Candida albicans growth were found to be completely reversed by micromolar quantities of zinc but not by iron or other trace elements. Similarly, supernatants of exudates from experimental abscesses in mice or from clinical specimens of abscesses in humans markedly inhibited the proliferation of C. albicans, and this effect was also completely reversed by zinc. A protein complex characteristic of calprotectin was identified in the abscess fluids. Preparations of the neutrophil growth-inhibiting protein, containing predominantly calprotectin, were shown to have zinc-binding activity by a dialysis technique. These findings suggest that the major mechanism of C. albicans growth inhibition by abscess fluids is through competition for zinc by a cytoplasmic protein apparently released from dying neutrophils.\r"

Thus, the potential of free or liposome-encapsulated streptomycin to treat acute MAC infection was investigated in beige mice. Free streptomycin administered intramuscularly 5 days a week (150 mg/kg) was effective in the liver, spleen, and lungs. At 4 weeks, liposome-encapsulated streptomycin, administered intravenously in weekly doses (15 mg/kg), reduced the colony-forming units in the liver and spleen by about the same extent as a 50- to 100-fold higher dose of free drug. With 4 weekly injections of liposomes, the colony-forming units in the liver and spleen were lower by 2.4 and 2.9 log units, respectively, compared to untreated controls, even by the end of 12 weeks. The effects of unilamellar and multilamellar liposomes were similar. These observations suggest that liposome encapsulation not only targets streptomycin to infected cells but also increases the residual activity of the drug.\r"

Responses to antigens of viruses homologous and heterologous to the antigenic group of the infecting viral strain were compared. Primary group A infection elicited antibodies cross-reactive with group B virus in the PRNB and the ELISAS for GB and FB. In contrast, primary group B infection induced significant increases in mean concentrations of antibody cross-reactive with group A virus only in the FA ELISA. Second RSV infections caused by group B viruses in children with histories of primary group A infection induced heterologous rises in the PRNA and GA assays, suggesting that prior group A infection had primed for a more extensive cross-reacting antibody response at the time of second RSV infections with group B viruses.\r"

Phagocytosis of yeast cells by PMNL was 81.3% +/- 3.7%. Fungistasis persisted even though PMNL viability decreased with time. Fungistatic activity of PMNL was dose dependent. Fungistasis was verified by direct hemocytometer counts of fungal units. In transwell experiments, PMNL contact with H. capsulatum was required for fungistatic activity. Lymphocytes, PMNL lysates, or PMNL supernatants were not fungistatic in this system.\r"

Adhesion of IRBC from Thai patients with uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria to purified CD36 or ICAM-1 and to C32 melanoma cells was compared. All malaria isolates bound to solid phase-adsorbed CD36 and to fluid-phase 125I-labeled CD36. IRBC adhesion to purified ICAM-1 varied widely, and no correlation with clinical severity of disease was observed. The cytoadherent phenotype of IRBC was modulated by selective panning on plates coated with purified CD36 or ICAM-1. IRBC selected by panning on CD36+, ICAM-1+ melanoma cells bound to cells that express surface CD36 but not to CD36-deficient cells, indicating that CD36 exerts a strong selective pressure on the IRBC cytoadherent phenotype. IRBC adhesion to CD36 and ICAM-1 suggests that P. falciparum parasites may use these receptors in vivo to promote parasite survival and immune evasion.\r"

Despite their successes, they have a major disadvantage in that several inoculations are required for them to be effective. To overcome this problem, a commercial inactivated vaccine preparation against tickborne encephalitis was combined with human growth hormone (HGH). This formulation produced complete protection in a murine model with only one dose of vaccine, apparently by binding hormone and antigen to an insoluble matrix containing aluminium hydroxide. Thus it is postulated that when virus-specific lymphocytes are attracted to the site of injection, the hormone is at a high local concentration and stimulates the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells. The development of genetically engineered HGH now gives unlimited supplies of hormone, potentially resulting in an increase in efficacy of a wide variety of vaccines, especially those needing prolonged immunization schedules such as those being developed to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

The fecal specimens from both groups were tested for poliovirus shedding 1-2 months after OPV. The virus isolates were examined for nucleic acid sequences in the 5' noncoding regions (bases 480, 481, and 472 for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively) to determine whether the viruses shed represented nonattenuated revertants, attenuated parent vaccine strains (nonrevertants), or both. In the OPV group, 4 of the 6 virus isolates recovered 30-60 days after the first immunization dose and 1 of the 3 isolates obtained after the second dose were found to be nonrevertants (parent vaccine strain). In contrast, 11 of the 12 isolates in the EIPV-OPV group were of the nonvaccine revertant virus types. The frequency for reversion appeared to differ for different poliovirus serotypes.

Minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of venoms from three crotalid species were determined against six aerobic and eight anaerobic reference and oral crotalid microorganisms. All anaerobic isolates were resistant to greater than 20,480 micrograms/ml, whereas variable activity (range, 5-20,480 micrograms/ml) was observed for aerobic strains. Further studies against other aerobic clinical isolates demonstrated that venom had the greatest activity (MIC, less than or equal to 80 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Proteus, and Morganella species. Inhibitory activity was lost with prolonged incubation for many gram-negative species. Crotalid venoms are broadly active against aerobic gram-negative and -positive bacteria. This activity may play a role in the low incidence of infection after envenomation injuries.\r"

P. vivax DNA was released from the filter paper samples, and the CS gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for genetic variation. Amplified DNA was probed with oligonucleotide probes that hybridize with the predominant CS repeat region (PV210) and the variant CS repeat region (PV247) of P. vivax. The PV247 variant was found in all three geographically diverse areas. In addition, five of six consecutive patients studied had simultaneous infection with both the predominant and variant forms of P. vivax. These findings suggest that a single-epitope vaccine based on the predominant CS domain is unlikely to be protective on even a regional basis.\r"

To circumvent interference by autoantibodies in the sera, fusion proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli were used as specific antigens. By ELISA the average IgG antibody titers to domains of the five EBNAs, especially the amino-terminal domain of EBNA-2, in sera of patients with Sjogren's syndrome were slightly higher than those in normal sera. The tendency of sera from Sjogren's syndrome patients to have higher reactivities to the EBNA domains was also observed by immunoblotting. By comparison, few heightened serologic responses to EBNAs were observed in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further analyses are required to determine if EBV is associated with Sjogren's syndrome in any way.\r"

All sera were tested by Western blot, ELISA, and p24 RIA. A total of 111 participants were seropositive in a minimum of two assays. Duration of intravenous heroin use was strongly associated with the risk of HTLV I/II seropositivity: greater than or equal to 21 years odds ratio, 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-17.5), compared with less than 10 years of heroin use. Additional independent risk factors included black or Hispanic race, female sex, and the use of drugs in a shooting gallery. Coinfection of HTLV I/II and human immunodeficiency virus was less frequent than expected by chance (P less than .02). Longitudinal specimens were available in 154 participants. The age- and race-adjusted seroconversion rate was 3.4% (95% CI, 1.3-8.9) per person per year. Of the 349 homosexual men tested, none were HTLV I/II-seropositive.\r"

  ".W": "Cell signaling events are known to affect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Treatment of lymphoid CEM cells with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (25-75 microM) enhanced HIV-1 expression in acute, whole virus infection experiments, despite lowering intracellular calcium levels, ablating the acute rise in intracellular calcium normally seen with infection, and lengthening the doubling time of cell replication. Verapamil had no effect on cell surface CD4 expression. Transfection of CEM cells with plasmids containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene showed that verapamil enhanced expression of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was abolished by mutations in the binding sites for nuclear factor kappa-B. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that verapamil induced nuclear factor kappa-B activity in CEM cells. Thus, verapamil, in high concentrations, can potentiate HIV-1 replication in lymphoid cells, and this effect may be mediated by induction of nuclear factor kappa-B.\r"

Quantitative nucleic acid amplification was used to study the correlation between shedding of HIV nucleic acids and gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV-infected infants and children. Many with HIV infection and persistent diarrheal disease shed HIV nucleic acids in their feces, as did an HIV-infected patient without apparent diarrheal disease. HIV nucleic acids were not found in feces of non-HIV-infected individuals. Intestinal infection with HIV appears to be important in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysfunction in infants and children with HIV infection. Furthermore, the fecal shedding of HIV may play a role in HIV transmission in environments prone to high levels of fecal-oral contamination.\r"

The prevalence of HIV antibodies was 29%, and that of malaria parasites was 9%. HIV antibodies were more prevalent in women from the urban center than in those from the outskirts (31% vs. 20%, P less than .001), and malaria parasites showed the opposite prevalence pattern (8% vs. 15%, P less than .001); after stratifying by location, there was no association between HIV and the presence or degree of malaria parasitemia. HIV prevalence was 45% in women who had received a blood transfusion between 1980-1985 (before screening of donated blood began), and 28% among the great majority (94%) who had never been transfused. HIV prevalence was 44% in single mothers. 34% in women in common law unions, and 20% in those in legal marriages. These high rates of infection in the general population of Kigali highlight the need to develop effective programs for preventing further spread of sexually transmitted HIV.\r"

Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities of the virus were also reduced by DF treatment. In addition, treatment with DF or MPO in the presence of H2O2 resulted in delayed migration of viral proteins in SDS-PAGE, indicating extensively modified viral proteins. Parallel with this aberrant migration, the radioactivity of each protein band on SDS-PAGE using [35S]methionine-labeled IFV was greatly reduced. Moreover, some of the modified viral protein did not migrate. A small amount of acid-soluble degraded viral peptide was also generated. The modification of the proteins was exhibited in all major viral proteins, including the inner proteins in the envelope. These results suggest that inactivation of IFV and protein modification by DF is due to MPO present in DF.\r"

Of adolescents and adults reported with AIDS from September 1987 through March 1990, 337 (0.48%) had recurrent Salmonella septicemia, with higher proportions among those who resided in the Northeast (0.86%), had a history of intravenous drug use (0.79%), or were black (0.74%) or Hispanic (0.57%).

LB+ at high concentration was toxic to Gardnerella vaginalis (the predominant organism in the vagina of women with BV); when the LB+ was lowered to a level where it was ineffective alone, the addition of myeloperoxidase and chloride reinstituted toxicity. Toxicity was inhibited by catalase and was not seen when H2O2-negative lactobacilli were used, implicating H2O2 as the toxic molecule. LB+ could be replaced by H2O2 and chloride by iodide, bromide, or thiocyanate. The optimum pH for inhibition of G. vaginalis was 5.0-6.0 LB+ also was autoinhibitory when combined with myeloperoxidase and chloride. LB+ alone at low concentrations was toxic to Bacteroides bivius through the formation of H2O2. Adequate amounts of peroxidase were found in the vagina of 17 of 21 women. These findings suggest that LB+ may contribute to the control of the vaginal flora, particularly in the presence of peroxidase and a halide.\r"

  ".U": "91277637\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Primary care physicians often do not document a psychiatric diagnosis when prescribing psychotropic medications. Recent literature suggests the potential benefit of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in a number of nonpsychiatric conditions (low back pain, peptic disease, fibrositis, headache, peripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid disease, and irritable colon). METHODS. Data from the 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) were used to categorize the primary diagnoses given during office visits in which tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed. Comparisons were made across specialties. RESULTS. Primary care physicians prescribed tricyclic antidepressants in 1% of all visits (an estimated 2,892,000 visits per year). Whereas 50% of these visits at which TCAs were prescribed were for documented psychiatric illnesses or conditions, 15% were for nonpsychiatric TCA-responsive conditions. The majority of visits by patients with these disorders were to primary care physicians. The pattern of TCA prescribing for these disorders by primary care physicians parallels that of other medical specialties except that primary care physicians prescribed TCAs for nonpsychiatric TCA-responsive disorders less frequently than did other medical specialists. CONCLUSIONS. When nonpsychiatric TCA-responsive disorders are included, primary care physicians document with appropriate diagnoses 15% more of their TCA prescriptions than previous studies have indicated. An understanding of the 35% of TCA prescriptions that do not show proper documentation will require further study and information not available from the NAMCS.\r"

Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of American and British family and general practitioners, as measured by their utilization of health care resources and the average length of the diagnostic interval, in diagnosing common complaints. METHODS. Several hundred charts from teaching practices in the United States and England were identified by computer search and reviewed. The charts were those of patients who had presented between 1978 and 1988 with a complaint of chest pain and were subsequently diagnosed as having angina pectoris or reflux esophagitis, or who presented with a complaint of shortness of breath and were subsequently diagnosed as having heart failure or asthma. RESULTS. The results of this study, which compared teaching family medicine practices in the United States and England, suggest that American family physicians diagnose common complaints such as chest pain and dyspnea in a shorter time with fewer visits and fewer consultations than their English counterparts, but order approximately the same number of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates the difficulties in interpreting international (cross-cultural) comparisons. Differences may be due to varying health care systems, economic factors, physician training, and physician practice styles, as well as patient expectations.\r"

A 19-item self-administered survey questionnaire was designed and mailed to 856 family and general practice physicians in Kansas. RESULTS. A 63% survey response rate was obtained. Seventy-eight percent of the physicians reported that abortion should be legal, but only 56% of the respondents classified themselves as pro-choice. Conversely, only 8% reported that legal abortion should not be available, even though 33% classified themselves as pro-life. The majority of physicians reported that abortion is an appropriate option to save the life of the mother, in cases of rape or incest, and when a fetal anomaly is diagnosed. Only three respondents (0.5%) had performed abortions during the previous year. In general, female physicians and physicians over the age of 40 years (regardless of sex) were more likely to be pro-choice and to view a woman's personal decision as a circumstance in which abortion may be appropriate. CONCLUSIONS. Physician's views about abortion and their practice patterns are important components of health care for thousands of women each day.\r"

We hypothesized that home air-fluidized bed therapy may be a safe and effective way to treat these patients, thus avoiding the costs of hospitalization. METHODS. One hundred twelve patients with 3rd or 4th stage pressure sores were randomly assigned to 36 weeks of either (1) home air-fluidized bed therapy that included the services of a visiting nurse specialist as long as the patient had 3rd or 4th stage sores, or (2) conventional therapy. RESULTS. Compared with patients in the control group, patients receiving air-fluidized bed therapy spent fewer days in the hospital (11.4 days vs 25.5 days, P less than .01) and used fewer total inpatient resources, as reflected both in charges ($13,263 vs $25,736, P less than .05) and in Medicare DRG and physician payments ($6,646 vs $12,131, P less than .05). Total resources used (inpatient and outpatient) were lower for patients treated with air-fluidized bed therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinical outcomes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. Home air-fluidized bed therapy is safe, reduces hospitalizations, is no more costly than alternative therapy, and allows the patients to receive their needed care in a more desirable, nonhospital setting.\r"

Two patients had positive serology; both were previously treated for syphilis and had no evidence of recurrent infection. The yield from screening the study population was 0. CONCLUSIONS. Serologic diagnosis of syphilis is not reliable or cost effective in groups with a very low prevalence of disease. Routine screening for syphilis in asymptomatic high-risk patients may not be indicated in all primary care settings.\r"

Differences between family practitioners and pediatricians regarding appropriate interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention in pediatric patients have been described by national surveys of physicians in the two specialties. the purpose of the study reported here was to determine whether similar differences existed in a more complete sample from a confined geographical area in which local standards of care might influence physicians practicing in the locale. METHODS. Members of the Southwestern Ohio Society of Family Physicians and the Cincinnati Pediatric Society were surveyed by questionnaire about their attitudes and practices concerning cardiovascular risk factors in children. The response rate was greater than 70% in each specialty group. RESULTS. Differences in the diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia were detected: (1) pediatricians screened patients at younger ages and used lower cutoff points for diagnosis (5.0 vs 5.5 mmol/L [192 vs 211 mg/dL]); and (2) family physicians were more likely to treat with medication (57% vs 5%), whereas pediatricians referred hypercholesterolemic patients to specialists more often (71% vs 19%). Both family physicians and pediatricians mislabeled blood pressures at the age-specific 90th percentile as normal (21% and 14%, respectively); this occurred more commonly with younger patients. Blood pressure was the risk factor most often measured, but smoking was the risk factor that received the most counseling by physicians in both specialties. CONCLUSIONS. Both family physicians and pediatricians reported feeling inadequately prepared to counsel lifestyle changes, and ranked obesity, smoking, and cholesterol as topics of greatest interest for continuing medical education courses. Physicians in both specialties did not routinely update family history of cardiovascular disease during well-child visits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of a rapid enzyme immunoassay test to noninvasively detect Chlamydia trachomatis urethritis in men from a urine specimen. METHODS. Urethral samples and urine from 207 patients were evaluated. Urethral and urine sediment Gram stains, leukocyte esterase dipstick tests, and enzyme immunoassay analyses of centrifuged and uncentrifuged urine were compared with urethral C trachomatis culture. RESULTS. The prevalence of infection in this population was 10.3%. Sensitivity and specificity of the enzyme immunoassay on the centrifuged urine specimen were 70% and 96%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 67% and 97%, respectively. The uncentrifuged urine enzyme immunoassay sensitivity was 35.7% and specificity was 98.9%. Leukocyte esterase test sensitivity compared with that of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or C trachomatis cultures was 83.3%, and specificity was 52%. CONCLUSIONS. The rapid enzyme immunoassay clinically complemented the screening urine sediment Gram stain and the leukocyte esterase test.

  ".W": "The sweat responses of nine patients with physiologically complete lesions of the spinal cord (six cervical and three thoracic) were recorded by two different techniques while the patients were exposed to elevated environmental temperatures. Oral temperatures, heart rate and respiration were monitored throughout the observational periods. Oral temperature invariably rose during exposure to heat and both heart rate and respiration tended to increase. Sweating was detected on all of the test areas by both the iodine-starch-paper technique and the quinizarin technique, but it was of widely varying intensity in different portions of the body. In the patients with cervical lesions sweating was generally profuse on the head and neck and occurred in progressively decreasing intensity down to the level of the umbilicus. It was invariably present, but only in very low intensity, on the lower extremity. Sweating was frequently present as a result of manipulation of the patient during the initial preparations, but this generally declined or stopped before the heat was turned on. With application of heat, sweating was recruited on previously dry areas or increased in intensity on those areas in which it was previously present. After oral temperature had increased moderately, the heat was turned off and the doors of the chamber opened widely so that the heat stimulus was suddenly removed. Despite a continued rise in oral temperature, sweating stopped or decreased dramatically. These results are interpreted to indicate the direct mediation by the isolated spinal cord of reflex sweating responses to a heat stimulus applied to the skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm.\r"

This postoperative headache was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it. Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy headache. Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without headache, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with headache. The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative \"cluster-like\" headache.\r"

The patients had a mean reduction in the amplitude of common peroneal compound muscle action potentials of 37% (95% CI 11-70%) and of sural sensory action potentials of 34% (CI 18-49%). Mean conduction velocity of both motor and sensory nerves was reduced by between 1 and 7 m/s, with a prolongation of F waves corrected for height of 5% in the arms and 13% in the legs. The distal motor latencies were unchanged. These changes did not correlate with the duration of AIDS, degree of immunosuppression (CD4 count), Body Mass Index, albumin or vitamin B12 level. Four patients had subclinical mononeuropathies. Sural nerve taken at necropsy from five asymptomatic AIDS patients had evidence of axonal degeneration without inflammation or demyelination. There was a mean reduction in myelinated fibre density of 30.5% (CI 10-51%) compared with eight age matched sudden death controls (p = 0.01). This loss principally affected the larger fibres. The pathological and electrophysiological changes indicate axonal degeneration and are similar to those seen in other chronic disorders and in normal ageing. It is concluded that this axonal degeneration is not specific to HIV.\r"

In the majority of previously reported patients with neurogenic muscle hypertrophy confined to the calf muscle, a passive stretch mechanism was suggested as a cause of the hypertrophy.

A prospective study was carried out of 27 patients who were in a good (Grade 1 or 2) condition before operation to identify the origin of such symptoms and discover whether the basic techniques of aneurysm surgery could lead to serious psychological sequelae even in the absence of any specific complication. Each patient was given a modified psychometric assessment just before surgery and at the time of discharge from hospital. One year later a full psychometric and social assessment was carried out. Even a temporary worsening of psychometric performance did not occur unless there had been some specific surgical or post-operative problem. Five patients showed worsening of psychometric performance in the immediate post-operative period but by one year, only two of the 27 patients showed any abnormalities on formal psychometric evaluation; in both, clear reasons were evident. Although the majority of patients reported minor psychological symptoms, these had not hindered full functional recovery, and we doubt whether they had any organic basis. It is concluded that aneurysm surgery does not, itself, threaten higher intellectual function unless some specific complication occurs.\r"

The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks. The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery.\r"

One involved different interdose intervals; in the other, doses were given when the motor effects induced by the previous dose had just worn off. No significant change in the duration of motor response to sequential subcutaneous apomorphine with either protocol was found. The results suggest that rapid changes in receptor sensitivity during repeated intermittent dopaminergic stimulation do not contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinsonian motor fluctuations.\r"

Average mean arterial pressures, however, decreased significantly with midazolam and diazepam. Statistically significantly higher heart rates during the entire procedure were also found for lorazepam when compared with diazepam and midazolam. At the postblock stage, the midazolam group had respiratory rates that were significantly higher than those of the other two drug groups. Patients in the diazepam and midazolam groups took significantly longer to complete the pegboard test at the preblock stage than those in the lorzepam group. At 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after arrival in the recovery room, an inversion of groups took place, with the lorazepam group taking significantly longer for their tests than the other two groups. Significantly more improvement in anxiety levels was found at 10 minutes postdrug for the patients who had received diazepam and this tended to remain so on arrival in the recovery room. When compared with the other two groups, significantly more patients in the lorazepam group reported giddiness/dizziness and significantly more in the diazepam group reported pain on injection.\r"

The orthopaedic literature has demonstrated that proteoglycan degradation plays a significant role in the pathology of many joints. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if levels of immunoreactive keratan sulfate (an important component of cartilage proteoglycans) present in synovial fluid aspirates from TMJs correlated with arthroscopically demonstrated OA. Temporomandibular joint arthroscopy was performed on 25 joints in 20 patients and synovial fluid aspirates were obtained just prior to the insertion of arthroscopic cannulas. The results showed that synovial fluid aspirates from joints that arthroscopically demonstrated OA had significantly higher levels of keratan sulfate than synovial fluid aspirates from those joints that showed no evidence of OA (NON-OA). This study gives support to the theory that the pathogenesis of OA of the TMJ is similar to that of chondromalacia of other synovial joints. The combination of TMJ arthroscopy and synovial fluid analysis is an important model that can be used for investigation of the pathogenesis of TMJ disorders.\r"

Twenty-one cases of significant bleeding following mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomies, vertical and oblique ramus osteotomies, and genioplasties are presented. Life-threatening hemorrhage associated with mandibular osteotomies is primarily an intraoperative problem and the incidence of major postoperative and recurrent hemorrhage is not as great as following maxillary osteotomies. Suggestions for the avoidance and treatment of these bleeding complications are discussed.\r"

The animals were killed at 1-week intervals starting at 2 weeks postirradiation. One half of each site was evaluated using standard histologic techniques while the other half was examined as a nondecalcified section. The quantity and the quality of new bone formation was determined using a rating scale and histomorphometric digitization. The results of this 4-month study showed that the amount of new bone formation around the HA granules was significantly greater in the irradiated sites. The irradiation produced no deleterious effects on the implant or the surrounding tissue areas.\r"

Stimulated and control implant sites were recovered 8 weeks postoperatively and examined histologically. The HA migrated into the mandible in the electrically treated specimens, and was routinely found in intimate association with preexisting mandibular bone. In the controls, the HA remained superior to the mandibular surface. In further studies (without electrical stimulation) in which the implant site was recovered 26 weeks postoperatively, HA was observed in the mandible; some HA particles migrated completely through the mandible and were found in the adjacent soft tissue. It was concluded that, under the conditions studied, electrical stimulation does not promote bone growth into HA, but rather produces the opposite result--it promotes more rapid movement of HA particles into the mandibular bone. The HA particle migration into the mandible observed (longer postoperative times) in the absence of electrical stimulation suggests that migration is a general property of HA particles when placed over bone under muscle.\r"

Prevention cannot be stressed enough; however, early recognition of an injury with prompt electrodiagnostic testing can assist with determining prognosis and treatment planning. When close observation is indicated, a variety of medical therapies have been suggested. For more severe injuries, nerve repair and facial reanimation have been reported.\r"

The dynamics of PMN mobilization and chemotaxis were evaluated during 19 infusions of epinephrine or cortisol or a combined infusion of both hormones in ten normal volunteers. Basal levels of epinephrine and cortisol increased during infusions to levels consistent with those reported following severe injury. Circulating neutrophil counts increased in parallel with plasma cortisol levels. Epinephrine mobilized the entire marginated pool of neutrophils, and the neutrophil half-life was extended from a normal of 6.6 hours to 10.4 hours by cortisol. Chemotaxis after six hours of epinephrine infusion was reduced compared with baseline chemotaxis. In four volunteers who had a second infusion of cortisol, chemotaxis was significantly depressed ten days after the infusion compared with baseline. From these data we conclude that stress levels of epinephrine mobilize the marginated pool of granulocytes into the circulating pool in a linear fashion, and cortisol raises the half-life of circulating neutrophils. Reduced neutrophil chemotaxis seen as a consequence of these infusions could account for some of the increased susceptibility to infection that occurs after major trauma.\r"

Glutamine uptake by the portal-drained viscera fell in the endotoxin-treated animals while glucose uptake doubled. Simultaneously, hepatic glutamine uptake increased ten-fold owing to both an increase in hepatic blood flow and glutamine extraction from the bloodstream. Hepatic alanine uptake, oxygen consumption, and glucose release were also accelerated in endotoxemic rats. The increase in liver glutamine utilization was associated with increases in parenchymal DNA and glutathione levels and an increase in glutathione and urea release into the systemic circulation. This marked increase in metabolic activity occurred in animals with chemical evidence of hepatocellular injury and histologic evidence of hepatocyte necrosis. During endotoxemia the liver becomes the major organ of glutamine consumption. This accelerated utilization provides carbons for energy and gluconeogenesis, nitrogen for ureagenesis, and substrate for nucleotide and glutathione biosynthesis in order to support cell repair and detoxification reactions.\r"

We studied the respiratory function of rats during sepsis-induced hypothyroidism with or without T3 treatment. Forty-four male Holtzman rats underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Treatment was administered at six hours after surgery consisting of intraperitoneal injection of T3 (15 micrograms/kg, n = 19) or saline (n = 25). At 20 hours (Group A) or 30 hours (Group B) following CLP, respiratory drive was assessed by serial occlusion pressure technique (P0.1). The rats were killed and static elastance determined by serial air inflation to 10 cc. The lungs were excised for weight determination. The P0.1 values were significantly greater in T3-treated animals over controls in Group A (9.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.6 +/- 2.2, p less than 0.05 by t test); elastance was significantly improved by T3 treatment in Group B (p less than 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). Lung weight, pH, pO2, pCO2, respiratory rate (RR), and mortality were not significantly different between groups. Control animals were hypothyroid by 20 hours after CLP (T3 less than 12.5 ng/dL) whereas T3-treated animals were euthyroid (T3 = 145 +/- 43 ng/dL). Pulmonary dysfunction frequently accompanies sepsis; the euthyroid state appears protective. We found a significantly improved respiratory drive in septic animals with T3 treatment. Lung elastance was similarly improved in late sepsis with T3 treatment. The data suggest that T3 treatment preserves respiratory function in septic rats as evidenced by respiratory drive and compliance.\r"

After five days of feeding, animals received an intra-abdominal abscess of defined bacterial content. Survivors were killed on post-laparotomy day 6 in conjunction with liver perfusion and protease liver digestion for Kupffer cell isolation. Kupffer cell PGE2 production was measured by radioimmunoassay after 18 hours of cell culture and again after stimulation with 0 LPS, 10 ng/ml LPS, and 10 micrograms/LPS. Mortality was decreased in menhaden oil-fed animals compared with safflower oil-fed animals (16% vs. 35%).

Keratinocytes were evaluated with the neutral red assay. Serial dilutions of each of 10 commonly used topical agents produced decreases in both the uptake of neutral red and the incorporation of thymidine at clinically relevant doses. Only Neosporin G.U. irrigant showed no significant difference compared with controls in the assays for both the fibroblasts and the keratinocytes. Careful attention must be paid to which agent is used in the clinical setting, since many of these can have profound effects on cells that influence wound healing.\r"

In the first set of experiments colloid was varied and sodium chloride was held constant, as 7.5% NaCl was paired with either 0%, 6%, or 12% dextran 70. A dose-response relationship existed, with cardiac output increasing 20% with each sequential dextran 70 concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in animals that were resuscitated with either the 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70 or 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution (p less than 0.05). Using the optimal dextran 70 concentration from the first set of experiments (i.e., 12%), solute was varied in a second set of experiments comparing 0.9%, 3.8%, 7.5%, or 10% NaCl/12% dextran 70. Again, dose-response features were demonstrated, as cardiac output increased as a function of NaCl concentration. However, this response plateaued with the 7.5% NaCl concentration and no advantage was obtained by increasing the NaCl concentration to 10%. We conclude that a 4-ml/kg bolus of 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution may be a more effective form of therapy than those previously evaluated. This new solution is now being included in our ongoing clinical trials.\r"

Forty-two patients (57%) became hypothermic at some time between injury and leaving the OR. Fifty-five patients (74%) had a temperature (T) recorded on arrival to the ED; but only 7 (12%) were hypothermic (34.7 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees C). In contrast, 34 patients (46%) arrived in the OR hypothermic (34.8 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C) and 26 (76%) of these left the OR hypothermic (34.8 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C). Eight additional patients (20%) arriving in the OR with a T greater than 35.9 degrees C left the OR hypothermic (35.1 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C). The mean T loss in the ED was significantly greater than that lost in the OR (-0.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C vs. 0.0 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C; p less than 0.0001, ANOVA). Ninety-two percent of the patients lost temperature in the ED, while 43% of the patients gained temperature in the OR. Hypothermia was associated with lower Trauma Scores, and those patients who were severely hypothermic received more intravenous fluids. However, the impact of fluid infusion was not independent from Trauma Score and did not fully explain the magnitude of the heat loss. These data suggest that hypothermia in trauma patients has a multifactoral etiology related to the magnitude of injury and that the major T loss occurs in the ED rather than in the OR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The study reported here sought to identify a group of adult head injury patients in whom computerized axial tomographic (CT) scans were not necessary. The study was limited to patients 18 years of age and older with a history of minor head injury who remained neurologically stable for 20 minutes after arrival at the trauma center, maintained a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 13, and had no clinical evidence of basal skull fracture. These patients had a uniformly good neurologic prognosis. The CT scan did not have any prognostic or therapeutic implications. Of a total of 348 patients studied, 12 had an abnormal CT scan with no neurologic deficits or sequelae, and all of them had an uneventful hospital discharge without readmission. It appears that a routine CT scan for minimal head injury patients is an inefficient use of personnel and equipment which may add to the ever increasing financial burden on trauma centers.\r"

  ".W": "The Organ Injury Scaling Committee of the AAST recently published a consensus classification of splenic, hepatic, and renal injuries (J Trauma, 29:1664, 1989). The hepatic injury scale (HIS), based on parenchymal laceration and intrahepatic hematoma, includes grades 1 to 6, representing the least to most severe injury. This study classifies liver injuries by findings at celiotomy, correlates operative findings with transfusion requirements and method of management of liver injury, and relates preoperative CT to anatomic findings at laparotomy. Thirty-seven patients with blunt liver injury were evaluated by abdominal CT with and without intravenous contrast and then underwent celiotomy. Increasing operative HIS correlated well with increasing severity of injury as measured by transfusions and operative management. Thirty-one CT grades did not correlate with operative findings (84%). Four patients had intrahepatic hematomas that were not discovered at operation. Twelve lacerations were graded too high by CT and 15 too low. Of these 15, ten CT scores were at least two grades lower than operative findings. Injuries around the falciform ligament occurred in three of the low misclassifications. One patient with intrahepatic hematoma developed hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. We conclude that the HIS readily characterizes operative findings of hepatic lacerations and that increasing operative grade correlates well with transfusion requirements and operative management. CT can define intrahepatic hematomas, but does not correlate well with hepatic lacerations. Extreme caution is required when using CT alone to define \"minimal\" liver injury for prospective management of blunt trauma victims.\r"

Little emphasis, however, has focused on the critical care phase of trauma patient management. This study was undertaken to determine the significance of critical care errors (CCEs) on preventable mortality and morbidity in a regionalized system of trauma care. The records of 12,910 trauma patients admitted to six trauma centers over a three-year period were reviewed. The cause and preventability of death was determined by a panel of trauma experts. Critical care errors occurred in 151 (23%) of all patients with errors occurring during any phase of care. The CCEs were identified in 38 of 125 (30%) deaths of patients with errors in some phase of care. The CCEs were implicated as the cause of death in 30 (48%) of the 62 preventable deaths. The proportion of preventable deaths attributable to CCEs was higher than the proportion of preventable death attributable to errors in the resuscitative and operative phases of care (p less than 0.001, chi-square). These data indicate that CCEs significantly contribute to preventable mortality and morbidity in trauma patients. It is imperative that physicians caring for trauma patients possess expertise in the critical care management of injured patients.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent reports have described abdominal injuries occurring as a result of seat belt use, raising concerns about seat belts as an agent of injury in motor vehicle crashes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the distribution of abdominal injuries after motor vehicle crashes in belted and unbelted patients admitted to trauma centers. The mortality was higher in unbelted than belted patients (7% vs. 3.2%, respectively, p less than 0.0001). Unbelted patients also had significantly more frequent and more severe head injuries (50.0% vs. 32.9%, respectively, p less than 0.001). The incidence of abdominal injury was equal in both unbelted patients (13.9%), but the spectrum of organs injured was different in the two groups. Gastrointestinal tract injuries (stomach, small bowel, colon and rectum) were significantly more frequent in belted vs. unbelted patients (3.4% vs. 1.8%, respectively, p = 0.001). The frequency of liver and spleen injuries was the same in both groups. This study demonstrates that in patients admitted to trauma centers after motor vehicle crashes, belted and unbelted patients have an equal incidence of abdominal injury, but belted and unbelted patients have a different spectrum of injuries. Hollow viscus injuries are more common in belted crash victims. Seat belt use was associated with significantly fewer head injuries and deaths. Physicians evaluating trauma victims after motor vehicle crashes should be aware of the fact that the types of abdominal injuries may vary substantially depending on seat belt use.\r"

We asked three questions about high cost trauma patients: (1) Do they survive?, (2) Do they continue to require expensive care?, and (3) Do they return to productivity? Of 6,129 consecutive trauma admissions, 114 had hospital charges over $100,000 (mean = $143,000), 102 (89.5%) were discharged alive, and 10 (8.8%) were lost to followup. Ninety-two patients or families were interviewed at least 1 year (mean = 2.6 year) after discharge. There were 88 survivors and 4 deaths (3.5%). Of the 88 survivors 73% had no limitation of ADLs, 67% received rehabilitation, 58% were still improving, and 37% were involved in litigation. Five survivors (5.7%) were confined to a nursing home, 48 (54.5%) had returned to productivity (RTP), 35 (39.8%) were unemployed, and five of these still require medical therapy. We conclude: (1) The majority of high cost patients survive (89.5%) and return to productivity (54.5%); (2) the severity of injury predicts survival but not return to productivity; and (3) the RTP rate may be increased by addressing nonmedical need.\r"

Nineteen patients with no prior history of cardiac abnormalities who sustained severe blunt chest trauma and had widening of the mediastinum on chest radiographs were prospectively evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). In each instance TEE was performed without difficulty, excellent images were obtained of the aorta and heart, and no complications were noted. Abnormalities were seen in 12 (63%) patients, with hypokinetic regional wall motion consistent with cardiac contusion demonstrated in five (26%) patients. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in three (16%) patients, and aortic and mitral regurgitation in one (5%) patient each. Aortic wall hematomas were seen in two patients, one of whom had an intimal tear on aortography, and a pericardial effusion was seen in one patient with an aortic intimal tear confirmed angiographically. Thus TEE can be performed safely in the acute setting of patients sustaining severe blunt chest trauma and yield useful information with respect to cardiovascular function and the aorta.\r"

Baseline measurements were made before aortic hemorrhage. During one hour of aortic hemorrhage or until death of the animal, the PASG was not inflated in Group I while the PASG in the other two groups was inflated to maintain carotid artery pressure at 15 torr below baseline (Group II) and at baseline (Group III), respectively. Survival was 100% in Group I, 50% in Group II, and 0% in Group III. Hemorrhage at 22.5 +/- 4.0 mL/min stopped after 18-24 minutes in Group I; the survivors in Group II bled at a rate of 32.5 +/- 3.0 mL/min compared with 43.6 +/- 4.0 mL/min over 26-35 minutes in the Group II nonsurvivors. Group III pigs bled at 107.5 +/- 8.0 mL/min over the 10-18 minutes of survival. The intended blood pressure could not be maintained beyond 30 minutes. Bleeding stopped in Group I when the blood pressure fell to 58.2 +/- 4.5 torr from a baseline of 119.0 +/- 10.0 torr. The blood pressure fell to 48.0 +/- 5.0 torr in the four Group-II survivors. After a transient maintenance of baseline blood pressure in Group III, a precipitous drop in blood pressure with death in 10-18 minutes occurred in all these animals. In this porcine model of thoracic aortic injury, PASG inflation increases hemorrhage and mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Triple-contrast CT consists of giving oral, intravenous (IV), and rectal contrast medium. Our hypothesis was that this test is an accurate predictor of the absence of a retroperitoneal injury requiring surgical repair. We prospectively enrolled 88 clinically stable patients who sustained penetrating wounds to the back or flank. Seventy-eight received a diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) before 3-CT. The scans were classified according to the risk of a retroperitoneal injury requiring repair. Patients who did not go to the operating room (OR) were observed for 48 hours. Of 88 patients entered, nine had high-risk scans, five of these patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, two of whom had significant injuries. Seventy-nine patients had non-high-risk scans. Seventy-seven were observed without complication, and two were explored for positive DPL, with no significant lesion found. The negative predictive value of a low- or moderate-risk 3-CT scan is 100% +/- 11%.\r"

Before the swine were killed, cultures were taken from portal and systemic blood, mesenteric lymph, and lymph nodes, and a portion of terminal ileum was resected for histologic study. Experimental animals experienced significant shock as demonstrated by changes in hemodynamic and biochemical variables. Cultures and histologic examination of the terminal ileum showed no significant difference between control and experimental animals.

Renal vascular resistance was calculated either according to the formula: renal vascular resistance (mm. Hg/ml. per second) = systemic arterial pressure (P)/renal blood flow or through the renal vascular resistive index (RVRI): RVRI = systolic flow velocity - diastolic flow velocity/systolic flow velocity = (S-D)/S. Renal vascular resistance estimation seems to be more contributory than renal blood flow in assessment of renal graft reperfusion disorders. Our results show that University of Wisconsin solution seems to preserve intrarenal arterial caliber better with a decrease in intrarenal vascular resistance, thus, allowing for a higher arterial graft perfusion flow.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain the relationship between the clinical neurological level, and bladder and sphincter behavior, the video-urodynamic studies of 489 patients with spinal cord lesions due to a variety of causes were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified based on the clinical neurological level, etiology of the lesion and presence or absence of signs of sacral cord involvement. Urodynamic findings were classified as either detrusor hyperreflexia, detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor areflexia or normal. The results indicate that although there was a general correlation between the neurological level of injury and the expected vesicourethral function, it was neither absolute nor specific. For example, 20 of 117 cervical cord lesions had detrusor areflexia, 42 of 156 lumbar cord lesions had detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia and 26 of 84 sacral cord had either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. However, if one considers the presence of neurological abnormalities, 84% of the suprasacral cord lesions with detrusor areflexia have sacral cord signs. In contrast, all suprasacral cord lesions with no evidence of sacral cord involvement have either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. The positive predictive value for positive sacral cord signs and detrusor areflexia was 87%. The positive predictive value for negative sacral cord signs and detrusor hyperreflexia/detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia was 81%. These data suggest that the clinical neurological examination alone is not an adequate barometer to predict neurourological dysfunction and that video-urodynamic evaluation provides a more precise diagnosis for each patient.\r"

  ".W": "In 21 healthy volunteers and 42 patients with either neurogenic bladder dysfunction (24), partial peripheral denervation of the bladder (12) or nonneurogenic bladder dysfunction (6) scalp-derived evoked potentials after stimulation of the vesicourethral junction (cortical evoked potentials) were recorded. In addition, evoked potentials from the posterior tibial nerve (tibial somatosensory evoked potentials) and from the pudendal nerve (pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials) were evaluated. The results obtained in normal subjects were reproducible and comparable to those reported in previous studies. Cortical evoked potentials of vesicourethral junction consisted of a prominent negativity with a mean latency of 95 msec. Tibial and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials were similar and showed a typical W-shaped complex. In normal subjects stimulation of the vesicourethral junction was described as a stimulus-synchronous pulsation combined with a continuous burning feeling and sometimes with a desire to void. In 4 normal subjects no cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction could be obtained because of a decreased pain threshold. In regard to clinical value, the results demonstrate that in patients with lesions of the central nervous system (in the group with cauda equina and conus medullaris lesions, and in the group with suprasacral spinal cord lesions) the results of cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials widely correlate due to similar afferent nervous pathways within the central nervous system. However, in patients with partial peripheral denervation of the bladder with suspected additional secondary local detrusor damage the results of cortical evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the vesicourethral junction differ mostly from the results of somatosensory evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the pudendal nerve. The pattern obtained (increased sensory and pain threshold, normal cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction with normal latencies and normal or increased amplitude) is indicative of local detrusor damage. In 21 patients the ability to detect cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction was combined with the sensation of stimulus-synchronous pulsation, whereas in the other 21 patients the absence of this sensation during stimulation was combined with the absence of cortical evoked potentials. On the other hand, no correlation was found between the ability of obtaining cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and the stimulus-induced sensation of pain and/or desire to void.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The introduction of ambulatory urodynamic tests is a promising improvement of our diagnostic abilities with respect to these disadvantages. To test the value of our ambulatory urodynamic method we evaluated 100 patients with urinary incontinence and/or voiding problems by both diagnostic methods. Pre-classification according to medical history was compared with the urodynamic diagnosis obtained from the conventional and extramural ambulatory monitoring methods, and the combination of both techniques in patients with urinary incontinence. The conventional method showed no abnormalities in 32% of the patients, compared to only 3% with the ambulatory method. The conventional method confirmed pre-classified stress incontinence in 36% of the patients, compared to only 14% by extramural ambulatory monitoring. Combining both methods, pre-classified stress incontinence was confirmed in 43% of the patients. Pre-classified urge incontinence was confirmed in 47%, 59% and 84%, and pre-classified mixed incontinence was confirmed in 23%, 29% and 55% of the patients using the conventional, extramural ambulatory monitoring and combination methods, respectively. An over-all correlation with the pre-classification in the incontinence group was found in 34% with the conventional method and 43% with extramural ambulatory monitoring. Combining both diagnostic tools showed a correlation with the pre-classification in 67% of the patients. These results show the promising impact of ambulatory urodynamic testing in the near future.\r"

Postoperative results were evaluated in 60 patients after Burch colposuspension (29) or bladder neck suspension according to the Gittes (18) or Stamey (13) method. No differences in continence rates were noted 3 months postoperatively (Gittes 83%, Stamey 85% and Burch 93% of the patients). Late results were assessed by urodynamic evaluation and transvaginal ultrasonography. The largest decrease in continence rate was observed after the Gittes procedure (44% of the patients continent, mean followup 14.7 months), in comparison with the Stamey (69% continent after 34.6 months) and Burch (86% continent after 30.5 months) procedures. Urodynamic parameters showed no significant differences for the 3 groups. Transvaginal ultrasonography did not indicate a correlation between absolute resting or stress position of the bladder neck and continence. The main factor concerning continence was the rotation angle and descent of the bladder neck during stress. Our data indicate that transvaginal ultrasonography is a safe and reliable method to evaluate the postoperative outcome for stress urinary incontinence.\r"

  ".W": "The bony pelvis was analyzed in 12 patients undergoing a further operation after initial bladder closure. Of the patients 5 had undergone a prior posterior osteotomy. All patients had wide diastasis of the pubis (average 5.5 cm.). In 9 of these patients late closure or reclosure of a failed initial bladder repair was done and 3 underwent a repeat bladder neck reconstruction. In all patients a new procedure, anterior iliac osteotomy with internal or external fixation, was performed. This procedure provides increased mobility of the pubis and increased correction. It avoids turning of the patient while under anesthesia for repeat preparation and in most cases postoperative traction is not needed. There were no instances of dehiscence, nonunion or infection. Three cases of transient femoral palsy were noted. All patients had a normal gait 4 months postoperatively. The mobility obtained after anterior osteotomy allows for excellent approximation. In view of evidence that approximation of the pubis improves closure and eventual continence results, we believe that osteotomies, even when repeated, are useful in revision surgery if there is bony diastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous enterocystoplasty rupture represents a devastating and potentially fatal late complication. Previously proposed mechanisms of rupture include catheter trauma, chronic infection, avulsion of adhesions between the bowel patch and peritoneum, and chronic overdistension with elevated intravesical pressures. We have witnessed this complication 4 times in 3 patients 5 weeks to 46 months postoperatively. Tissue specimens from 3 episodes in 2 patients with detubularized sigmoid enterocystoplasties were available for histological examination. All patients had a neurogenic bladder from myelomeningocele, all had an AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter and all had a documented history of chronic distension from inadequate emptying of the augmented bladder. At exploration, all of the ruptures were found within the bowel segment near the bladder apex in an area remote from the anastomotic line. In each case tissue specimens from the rupture site showed marked vascular congestion, intramural hemorrhage, abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages, myofiber atrophy and intravascular thrombi. These features are interpreted to reflect the sequelae of vascular compromise and ischemia. We propose that enterocystoplasty rupture results from ischemia, possibly due to chronic overdistension and subsequent vascular compromise. This mechanism may account for many of the previously reported cases of enterocystoplasty rupture.\r"

Ultimately the mass proved to be a chronic hematocele, a rare complication of uremic coagulopathy and hemodialysis.

  ".U": "91278185\r", 
  ".W": "Suramin is a trypanocidal drug that has generated recent interest as an antineoplastic agent because of its ability to inhibit the binding of growth factors to their cell surface receptors. Our studies, and others, suggest that the androgen-independent human prostatic carcinoma cell lines PC3 and DU145 proliferate via autocrine growth mechanisms mediated by transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) and its receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The present studies were designed to evaluate the ability of suramin to inhibit PC3 and DU145 proliferation by interfering with TGFa-mediated autocrine growth. Suramin induced a dose-dependent reduction of prostatic tumor cell proliferation which was reversed by removal of suramin from the culture medium. 3H-thymidine release studies showed that suramin had little direct cytotoxicity to either cell line. These findings suggest that the effects of suramin are mediated by cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, mechanisms. Suramin also interfered with TGFa-mediated growth mechanisms. Specifically, suramin reduced the specific binding of TGFa to PC3 and DU145 cells. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of suramin on DU145 was reversed by cultivation of cells in the presence of excess TGFa. Further investigations revealed that suramin increased the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle for both cell lines. These studies show that the inhibitory effect of suramin on PC3 and DU145 cell growth is mediated, in part, by alteration of TGFa-mediated autocrine growth mechanisms and cell cycle kinetics.\r"

The maximal LAK activity was obtained from splenocytes of rats bearing tumors for 10 to 14 days after incubation with 1000 U/ml./day of rIL-2 for five to eight days. The majority of these LAK cells expressed high levels of asialo GM1 (89%), laminin (83%), OX-19 (80%) and OX-8 (88%) surface markers. LAK cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity to rat prostate tumor cells and mouse lymphoma in vitro than to other non-prostate tumor cells or normal rat splenocytes and thymocytes. Splenocytes of rats bearing prostate tumors have higher LAK activity than normal splenocytes. The Winn type assay showed that Dunning prostate tumor growth was inhibited effectively by LAK cells at a tumor cell:LAK cell ratio of 1:50. The therapeutic efficacy of LAK cells in the treatment of primary solid prostate tumors and pulmonary metastases of Dunning rats was evaluated. LAK cells in combination with rIL-2 showed a greater therapeutic benefit in 1) prevention of prostate tumor metastases to lung, 2) retardation of the primary tumor growth, 3) regression of spontaneously established pulmonary metastases, and 4) prolongation of survival as compared to untreated controls or those groups treated with LAK cells or rIL-2 alone. The results of this study indicate that the conjunctive therapeutic approach of using surgical therapy to remove primary solid tumors followed by adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells plus in vivo administration of IL-2 may be potentially valuable in the treatment of prostate tumors, particularly for the spontaneous pulmonary metastases.\r"

  ".W": "The isotonic response of the sheep ureterovesical junction to histamine receptor agonists and antagonists was studied in vitro. Histamine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) produced a concentration-dependent contraction which was dependent on the extracellular calcium concentrations. Nifedipine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) partially inhibited the contractile response to histamine. 2-Methylhistamine and 2-pyridylethylamine elicited contractile effect in a concentration-related manner. The order of potency was histamine greater than 2-methylhistamine greater than 2-pyridylethylamine. Dimaprit and 4-methylhistamine produced no response in this tissue. The histamine contraction was antagonized by mepyramine, the pA2 value being 8.41, but not by cimetidine (10(-4) M). Scopolamine (10(-5) M) and indomethacin (10(-6) M) had an inhibitory effect. Phentolamine (10(-5) M), propranolol (10(-7)) and hexamethonium (10(-6) M) did not alter the histamine-induced contractions. The present results indicate that the response to histamine in sheep ureterovesical junction is mediated mainly by a direct action on the smooth muscle through excitatory histamine H1-receptors and partly by an indirect action via the stimulation of intramural cholinergic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "The low incidence of atherosclerosis and other degenerative diseases including stone disease in the Greenland Eskimo has been attributed to their high consumption of oily fish with its high concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Man cannot synthesis EPA from the precursor essential fatty acid, linolenic acid, and can only assimilate preformed EPA present in fish and fish oil, to bring about a change in the pathway of eicosanoid metabolism from the n-6 to the n-3 series. With a westernised diet the oxygenated products of renal prostaglandin synthesis are metabolites of the n-6 series and these are known to play an important role in several pathophysiological states including stone disease. Our previous studies have shown a relationship between prostaglandin activity and urinary calcium excretion and it would seem that the initiating factor/s for stone formation trigger the mechanisms for prostaglandin synthesis resulting in the biochemical abnormalities associated with stone disease. The Eskimo may be protected from these events by possession of an eicosanoid metabolism that follows an n-3 pathway. To test this hypothesis experiments were performed using an animal model of nephrocalcinosis. The animals were divided into three groups; one group was given an intra-peritoneal injection of 10% calcium gluconate daily for 10 days to induce nephrocalcinosis; a second group was fed MaxEPA fish oil before and during the calcium gluconate injections and a third group only received an intra-peritoneal injection of N saline. A group of 12 recurrent, hypercalciuric/hyperoxaluric stone-formers were treated with fish oil for eight weeks to study the effects on solute excretion. Nephrocalcinosis, which was readily produced in the control animals, was prevented in the experimental animals by pre-treatment with fish oil and urine calcium excretion was significantly reduced. The urinary calcium and oxalate excretion in the recurrent, hypercalciuric stone-formers was significantly reduced with fish oil treatment over an eight week period. There were no untoward side-effects. These studies indicate that the incorporation of EPA in the diet as a substitute metabolic pathway could be a unique way of correcting the biochemical abnormalities of idiopathic urolithiasis.\r"

H2O intracavernous pressure after papaverine injection was reduced under sympathetic trunk stimulation to 40.6 cm. H2O within a mean of 39 sec. In addition the flow of the internal pudendal artery was reduced indicating a decrease of the inflow to the penis. After the sympathetic stimulation was terminated, the intracavernous pressure increased again to the same level as before. This pressure recovery time was delayed after several sympathetic stimulations from 134 sec. (5 min. after papaverine injection) to at least 362 sec. (45 minutes after papaverine injection). Stimulation of the inferior hypogastric plexus had no effect on the intracavernous pressure. The neurostimulation range (3-4V; 20 Hz) was most effective in reducing the papaverine action on penile smooth muscles. The effect of sympathetic trunk stimulation seems to antagonize the relaxing action of papaverine on the cavernous smooth muscles and the cavernous arterioles. Our results imply that high sympathetic tone in some patients with psychogenic impotence may explain their poor response to intracavernous injection of papaverine.\r"

One monoclonal antibody designated MCA-R1 (IgG2a subtype) produced an intense immunostaining of various androgen independent Dunning rat prostate tumor sublines (HIS, HIM, HIF, AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, MAT-Lu and MAY-Ly-Lu), but did not stain other tumors of rat origin or normal rat tissues. Marginal immunostaining was detected in the androgen responsive R-3327H and R-3327G tumor subline. Although MCA-R1 antibody did not react with the regressed prostate tumor of R-3327H or R-3327G, it strongly reacted with the relapsed prostate tumor from either R-3327H or R-3327G tumor derived from rats were treated with diethyl stilbestrol (DES) or castration. MCA-R1 antibody also produced a strong cross-reaction with human prostate adenocarcinoma. Like the Dunning rat tumor, human adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct immunostaining patterns with respect to intracellular localization among well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumor. Benign prostatic hyperplasia or other normal tissues did not stain. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and radioautographic analysis revealed that the Dunning rat prostate tumor antigen recognized (m.wt. 50 and 120 Kd) by MCA-R1 antibody are localized on both cell surface and in the cytoplasm. This MCA may represent a potential reagent for the study of tumor biology and immunotherapy of prostate tumor.\r"

In order to determine if lithotripsy has any negative effects on development, immature rabbits were used to study the relationship of extracorporeal shock waves to renal and skeletal growth. Rabbits in both the control and treatment groups had metallic clips placed surgically to demarcate the kidneys. Following unilateral kidney and femoral head treatment of the respective study groups with the Dornier Lithotripter Model HM-3, the rabbits were allowed to grow to maturity (six months). Plain radiographs were taken at three months. There was no significant difference between control and study groups when length of the kidneys or femurs, the diameter of the femoral heads, or the rabbits weights were compared. At six months of age, the rabbits were weighed, then sacrificed. The kidneys and femurs were removed. Comparisons between the control and study groups were then made for weight of the rabbit, weight and volume of the individual kidneys, femoral length, and femoral head diameter. Following these measurements sectioning and histologic examinations were done. In all parameters grossly and histologically, there was no statistically significant difference. It is concluded from this study that treatment with extracorporeal shock waves does not adversely affect overt rabbit renal or bone growth, making treatment of pediatric patients with ESWL appear safe in regard to these parameters. Future studies will be directed at confirming these findings in children.\r"

Five noninvasive tumors were similarly examined. Four of these were negative and one showed weak staining. Biodistribution experiments with human bladder tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice using radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 425 and an isotype matched control antibody demonstrated specific tumor localization at five and seven days following antibody injection. Successful imaging of a human bladder tumor xenograft was achieved five days post antibody injection. These data confirm that epidermal growth factor receptor expression correlates with bladder cancer stage and suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor may serve as a target antigen for radioimmunoscintigraphy.\r"

Internal radiation dosimetry and mini-dose Mab-targeted radiotherapy studies reveal that tumor size affects the efficacy of treatment. For tumors with calculated weight greater than 400 mg., intravenous administration of 131I-labeled A6H or A6H-C5H combination delivers significantly less tumor radiation dose (2070 +/- 580 cGy/100 microCi) than those for tumors of weight less than 200 mg. (5260 +/- 2460 cGy/100 microCi). In the mini-dose (an average of 73 to 86 microCi) Mab-targeted radiotherapy study of 109 mice with small tumors (six, 12, or 19 days after implantation), tumors 12 days after implantation (approximately 60 mg. in weight) showed regression in all mice and in 62% of mice gross tumor elimination was observed. In contrast, mini-dose therapy at day 19 (tumor weights approximately 170 mg.) resulted in tumor regression and tumor elimination rates of 33% and 17% respectively. These studies suggest that Mab-targeted radiotherapy is more suitable for treating small tumors.\r"

These factors induce impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels in man and in experimental animals. In this study the effects of hypercholesterolemia on the reactivity of rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle strips to endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent agents were investigated. New Zealand White rabbits (n = 14) were randomly divided into control and treatment groups. The control group (n = 7) received a regular diet while the treatment group (n = 7) was fed a diet of 0.5% cholesterol and 4% peanut oil for 10 weeks. Animals were then sacrificed and the corporal tissue studied in organ chambers for isometric tension measurement. Tissue was contracted with phenylephrine and concentration-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, in the presence and absence of indomethacin, and to nitroprusside were examined. Blood level of cholesterol in the cholesterol-fed group was significantly higher compared to the control group. Contractions to phenylephrine were similar in both groups. Hypercholesterolemia, however, inhibited relaxation to acetylcholine but did not alter relaxation to nitroprusside, a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent, direct smooth muscle dilator. Indomethacin enhanced the relaxations to acetylcholine in both control and cholesterol-fed groups but did not correct the difference in the relaxation to acetylcholine between both groups. It is concluded that hypercholesterolemia impairs endothelium-mediated relaxation of rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. The mechanism for the endothelial dysfunction does not appear to involve alteration in cyclooxygenase products of arachidonate or the cGMP-dependent relaxation of corporal smooth muscle. Impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation of corporal smooth muscle may contribute to the pathophysiology of impotence associated with hypercholesterolemia in man.\r"

The pain scores according to the visual analogue scale were significantly higher in the patients given 11 ml. jelly than in those given 20 ml. when all patients in the study were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the visual analogue scale between the 2 treatments in women but a significant difference was noted in men, although in men older than 55 years the difference was not statistically significant. There was general agreement between the visual analogue scale results and the physician scores but the visual analogue scale procedure was more sensitive in detecting differences between treatments. It is suggested that approximately 11 ml. 2% lidocaine jelly is the appropriate volume for women and 20 ml. is the appropriate volume for men during cystoscopy but that the lower volume of jelly may be sufficient in older men.\r"

All patients were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and none had intravesical chemotherapy at any time during the median followup of 78 months. No patient had carcinoma in situ. A total of 14 patients (27%) had deep muscle invasion. None of the patients with grade 1, 5 (22%) with grade 2 and 9 (50%) with grade 3 to 4 tumors had deep muscle invasion. Comparison of the risk of muscle invasion using pathological tumor grade at diagnosis, highest grade at any cystoscopic biopsy before the diagnosis of muscle invasion or highest grade at cystoscopic biopsy immediately antecedent to the cystoscopy at which muscle invasion was diagnosed all showed similar probability of muscle invasion. Mean interval to development of muscle invasion was 6 and 12 months in the grades 2 and 3 to 4 groups, respectively. At 36 months the cumulative probability of invasion-free survival was 62% for grade 2, compared to 50% for grades 3 to 4 cancer patients (p less than 0.005, Gehan). Univariate regression analysis demonstrated grade to be the only significant factor in predicting for invasive disease (p = 0.005), with tumors in the bladder neck to be of borderline significance (p = 0.159). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, grade remained the single tumor variable predicting for invasive bladder cancer (p = 0.004). These data suggest that of routinely available data at diagnosis and during subsequent followup cystoscopic examinations, tumor grade is the most important biological predictor of progression to muscle invasive cancer.\r"

A total of 126 patients (70 for prophylaxis of recurrent stages Ta and T1 papillary tumors and 56 for treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue) underwent a 6-week course of 75 mg. BCG (Pasteur vaccine). An additional course was given in patients who failed to respond to the induction course. Maintenance therapy was administered in complete responders monthly for 1 year and then quarterly for 1 year. The prophylaxis group (transurethral resection plus BCG) was randomized versus transurethral resection alone (63 patients, control group). A complete response in the prophylaxis, control and therapy groups was observed in 74, 17 and 57% of the patients, respectively, while 4, 17 and 12.5%, respectively, experienced tumor progression. The additional course of therapy increased the response rate. On the contrary, previous unsuccessful intravesical chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. In regard to toxicity, irritative disturbances (27%) and fever (17%) appeared to be significantly decreased compared with the rates reported in the literature. No major complications were experienced. In conclusion, a low dose (75 mg.) Pasteur strain BCG regimen was effective as prophylaxis against recurrent superficial papillary tumors and as treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue. Toxicity related to the treatment appeared to be low.\r"

A total of 42 patients had either 1 (stage pN1) or more than 1 (stage pN2) positive lymph nodes (20 and 22 patients, respectively). The over-all 3-year survival rate for patients with positive lymph nodes was 27%, and it was 30 and 18.5% for stages pN1 and pN2 disease, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a sustained survival advantage for stage pN1 over pN2 disease for the first 3 years (p less than 0.05) but the difference was not significant at 5 years of followup. Eleven patients with negative lymph nodes but local extension of tumor into the prostatic stroma and/or ducts had a 5-year survival rate of 36%, which equaled the survival of 49 stage pT3b,pN0 cancer patients in the same series. Surgical mortality for the entire population of 280 patients was 2.1% and there was no increase in mortality or morbidity among the node positive patients. Based on the findings of improved survival of stages pN1 and pT3b,N0 cancer patients compared to stage pN2 cancer patients, the tumor, nodes and metastasis classification offers more specific prognostic information than does a single designation of Jewett stage D disease.\r"

Experience with 1-stage correction of hypospadias and epispadias, using a vascularized island flap technique, has led to its increased application for complicated adult urethral strictures. The advantage of the vascularized island flap technique is that reconstruction can be completed with only 1 operation, and it provides good subjective and objective results. Analysis of 50 consecutive cases treated by this approach has proved its validity. Of the 50 cases fistulas occurred in 20%, of which 12% required surgical correction, and stricture recurred in 32%. The largest proportion of recurrence was noted in patients who were primarily treated with 3 or more urethrotomies within a short time. Therefore, we recommend open surgical repair when 1 or 2 internal urethrotomies fail to produce a good result.\r"

Real-time studies were performed in 5 patients with both devices used simultaneously. The results of the measurements with both monitors were rather identical, indicating that both devices are applicable in a satisfactory manner for real-time investigation. Within a short period 5 patients performed nocturnal monitoring at home with the Surgitek Art-1000 and RigiScan devices during 2 consecutive nights. The Surgitek Art-1000 device provided less reliable and less informative results when compared with the RigiScan monitor during these nocturnal measurements. It appears that problems with sizing and fixing of the passive sensing loops of the Surgitek Art-1000 device by the patient are the main cause of these disappointing results. We believe that when the loops are sized and fixed by the investigator, for example during nocturnal measurements in the hospital, the applicability will be more satisfying. This monitor seems not to be suitable for nocturnal measurements by the patient at home.\r"

A total of 44 impotent patients entered this study. We used duplex ultrasonography (Diasonic DRF/400) to assess the role of the dorsal and deep arteries in arteriogenic and nonarteriogenic impotent patients. Vascular velocity, as well as the change in diameter, was recorded before and after an intracavernous injection of 60 mg. papaverine. In the arteriogenic impotence group (28 patients, 63.6%), the velocity increments were 37.1 +/- 23.6 (right side) and 35.4 +/- 17.5 (left side) cm. per second in the dorsal arteries, and 8.3 +/- 5.9 (right side) and 12.6 +/- 5.6 (left side) cm. per second in the deep arteries. In the nonarteriogenic group (16 patients, 36.4%) the velocity increments were 46.5 +/- 25.2 and 41.1 +/- 22.4, respectively, in the dorsal arteries, and 37.3 +/- 16.5 and 37.5 +/- 15.8, respectively, in the deep arteries. Comparison of the velocity increments between the arteriogenic and nonarteriogenic groups revealed no difference in the dorsal arteries (p greater than 0.1) but a significant difference was noted in the deep arteries (p less than 0.01). Similar findings were also encountered when the velocities and diameter increments were compared. This study indicates that the deep arteries have an important role in erectile response, while the dorsal arteries are less important.\r"

In a retrospective analysis during a 2-year period 236 patients treated with endourological procedures and 71 who underwent ESWL with a Siemens Lithostar were analyzed as to the success rate, effectiveness quotient, complication rate and hospitalization. The mean stone size was 1.12 cm. in the endourology group and 1.03 cm. in the ESWL group. Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 93.6% of the patients treated endourologically and without retreatment. In the ESWL group success was obtained in 90.1%, with an 11.2% retreatment rate. The retreatment rate was higher (25.0%) for calculi in the mid ureter. The group treated endourologically had a better success rate and no retreatment was necessary. On the other hand, the group treated with ESWL had a shorter hospitalization and a lower complication rate. Followup ranged from 11 to 60 months (mean 48 months) in the endourology group and 7 to 29 months (mean 11 months) in the ESWL group. These observations showed that in situ ESWL therapy with the Siemens Lithostar device is the method of choice for upper ureteral stones. Lower ureteral calculi should be treated endoscopically. Mid ureteral stones larger than 1 cm. had better results with endoscopic procedures and those smaller than 1 cm. had better results with ESWL.\r"

The most important danger is the risk of testicular atrophy which results in sterility. Four patients with bilateral mumps orchitis received systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2B (3 x 10(6) IU per day) for 7 days. All acute symptoms of mumps orchitis disappeared within 2 to 4 days of hospitalization. During 6 to 15 months of followup no incidence of testicular atrophy was observed. In 3 of 4 patients pre-treatment examination revealed subfertility (oligoasthenospermia), while 2 to 4 months after interferon treatment, as well as during the entire followup period normospermia was found. No severe adverse effects occurred during treatment. The flu-like symptoms could be prevented by concomitant administration of paracetamol (500 mg. 3 times a day). Systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2B appears to be highly effective in preventing sterility and testicular atrophy after bilateral mumps orchitis. Further investigations involving larger populations should be performed to establish the present promising results.\r"

Placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme was elevated in 50% of the stage I seminoma patients and in all patients with stages II to III disease. In addition, liver (tissue unspecific) alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 10 and 83% of the patients, respectively. Lactic dehydrogenase and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) were detected in 50 to 60% of the patients with stage I seminoma. By combining placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme, lactic dehydrogenase and beta-HCG, 75% of the stage I and 100% of the stages II and III seminoma patients could be identified correctly. Placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme in serum also occurred with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor but less frequently, while liver alkaline phosphatase was not detected at all. Thus, placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase were predominantly determined in the serum of patients with seminoma. In studies of tumor tissues from 31 of these patients, those with normal serum placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme levels had significantly lower tissue placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme levels than patients with elevated serum levels (p less than 0.01). Seminoma tissues showed significantly higher levels of placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase than nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (p less than 0.01), explaining the infrequent elevation of serum placental alkaline phosphatase-like enzyme and liver alkaline phosphatase found in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors.\r"

The incidence of adenomatoid tumors relative to all tumors in the testis was 6.9% (8 of 116), exceeding that of Leydig cell tumors, which were previously believed to be the most common benign testicular neoplasms. The adenomatoid tumors included 38% epididymal tumors (11 of 29). The clinical course of the tumors was benign, without recurrences. Local excision is regarded as the treatment of choice for epididymal and testicular adenomatoid tumors.\r"

  ".U": "91278211\r", 
  ".W": "We assessed the ability of 31phosphorus (31P) transrectal magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize normal human prostates as well as prostates with benign and malignant neoplasms. With a transrectal probe that we devised for surface coil spectroscopy we studied 15 individuals with normal (5), benign hyperplastic (4) and malignant (6) prostates. Digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to aid in accurate positioning of the transrectal probe against the region of interest within the prostate. The major findings of the in vivo studies were that normal prostates had phosphocreatine-to-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratios of 1.2 +/- 0.2, phosphomonoester-to-beta-ATP ratios of 1.1 +/- 0.1 and phosphomonoester-to-phosphocreatine ratios of 0.9 +/- 0.1. Malignant prostates had phosphocreatine-to-beta-ATP ratios that were lower (0.7 +/- 0.1) than those of normal prostates (p less than 0.02) or prostates with benign hyperplasia (1.1 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01). Malignant prostates had phosphomonoester-to-beta-ATP ratios (1.8 +/- 0.2) that were higher than that of normal prostates (p less than 0.02). Using the phosphomonoester-to-phosphocreatine ratio, it was possible to differentiate metabolically malignant (2.7 +/- 0.3) from normal prostates (p less than 0.001), with no overlap of individual ratios. The mean phosphomonoester-to-phosphocreatine ratio (1.5 +/- 0.5) of prostates with benign hyperplasia was midway between the normal and malignant ratios, and there was overlap between individual phosphomonoester-to-phosphocreatine ratios of benign prostatic hyperplasia glands with that of normal and malignant glands. To verify the in vivo results, we performed high resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy on perchloric acid extracts of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue obtained at operation and on a human prostatic cancer cell line DU145. The extract results confirmed the differences in metabolite ratios observed in vivo. We conclude that transrectal 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy can characterize metabolic differences between the normal and malignant prostate.\r"

Multiple directed and systematic biopsies of the prostate detected 78% of the nonpalpable prostate cancers diagnosed in the study population. Radical prostatectomy was performed in all 9 men with prostate cancer: there were 3 small organ-confined tumors, 5 large organ-confined tumors and 1 stage C tumor with 1 focus of microscopic capsular penetration. Our results suggest that multiple directed and systematic ultrasound guided biopsies are capable of detecting low volume nonpalpable prostate cancer in men with BPH. However, the exact indication for pre-treatment ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate in men with symptomatic BPH remains unclear. It may be that use of this modality is most appropriate for patients undergoing pharmacological therapy or balloon dilation of BPH rather than for those undergoing transurethral prostatectomy.\r"

Each had a normal prostate by digital rectal examination, no history of prostatic adenocarcinoma and no invasion of the prostate by transitional cell carcinoma. Real-time and step-sectioned ultrasound images were interpreted at the time of sonography and results were compared to pathological examination of the step-sectioned prostate specimen. When adenocarcinoma was identified in the specimen, cancer volume was determined. Positive ultrasound scans consisted of those exhibiting hypoechoic lesions. Hypoechogenicity due to transurethral resection defects, benign hyperplasia, vascular structures or shadowing from calcifications was not considered positive. Of 51 patients 27 (52.9%) exhibited no abnormality on ultrasound and were free of cancer in the prostate specimen, while 8 (15.7%) demonstrated a hypoechoic lesion that was proved to be prostate cancer. Seven patients (13.7%) with normal transrectal ultrasound scans had adenocarcinoma of the prostate, while 9 (17.6%) had lesions on ultrasound but no cancer. Based on these results, transrectal ultrasound has a sensitivity of 53.3% and a specificity of 75%. Further analysis reveals that transrectal ultrasound is more accurate in the detection of cancers of greater than 0.20 cc in volume than those of 0.20 cc or less. Transrectal ultrasound also is more accurate in the detection of peripheral zone than transition zone cancers.\r"

Adequate followup was available in 162 patients with proximal, 62 with mid and 146 with distal ureteral stones. The fraction of patients with stone-free ureters within 3 months after ESWL was 96, 97 and 97%, respectively. Of all patients only 13 (3.6%) had residual stones or fragments in the ureter after 3 months. The average number of ESWL sessions was 1.34 for all patients, and 1.36, 1.45 and 1.38 for those with proximal, mid and distal ureteral stones, respectively. A ureteral catheter with saline irrigation was used whenever it was possible to insert a ureteral catheter. Only 15 stones were pushed up to the kidney during catheterization and all other stones were treated in situ. There were more retreatments in patients in whom the stone had not been bypassed by a catheter at the initial ESWL session. During at least 1 treatment session 238 patients had a ureteral catheter with the tip above the stone. Approximately half of all patients were treated after only premedication with pethidine and diazepam, and cutaneous half of all patients were treated after only premedication with pethidine and diazepam, and cutaneous anesthesia with an anesthetic cream containing lidocaine-prilocaine (for proximal and mid ureteral stones). Small supplements of pethidine and diazepam were given to the other patients during the ESWL session. In situ ESWL of ureteral stones as described is a convenient, efficient and attractive procedure that, applied in a consequent manner, theoretically might result in a successful outcome in up to 98% of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Transperineal 125iodine implants of the prostate can be performed with ultrasound guidance, a simple technique that has met with widespread acceptance. However, ultrasound does not allow good visualization of the pubic bones in relation to the pelvic outlet, and the pubic bones may interfere with needle placement in the anterior peripheral aspect of the prostate. Adequate irradiation of the entire periphery of the prostate is important to assure tumor control, since most tumors are multicentric and may involve the anterior aspect of the prostate. A computerized tomography-based treatment planning procedure that allows for angulation of transperineal needles to avoid the pubic bones and still reaches the most peripheral aspects of the gland is described. The technique also allows for the use of transrectal ultrasound and fluoroscopy to verify correct needle placement in the prostate at the procedure. Early treatment results, based on prostate specific antigen and regression of palpable tumors, are encouraging.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 61 patients, less than 70 years old at diagnosis, with clinical stage T1-2, NX, M0, cytologically well or moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma was prospectively included in a surveillance study. Median patient age was 63 years (range 38 to 69 years). Mean followup was 96 +/- 24 months. The probability of local progression to stage T3 disease after 5 and 10 years was 49 and 72%, respectively. The probability of metastases developing after 5 and 10 years was 8 and 23%, respectively. The probability of dying of prostate adenocarcinoma was 2 and 8%, respectively. Moderately differentiated cancer progressed locally significantly faster than well differentiated disease. The relative number of patients who had metastases or died of prostate adenocarcinoma found in our study was comparable to the relative numbers reported after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. Therefore, deferred therapy may be an alternative to active therapy in patients with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma and with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 132 patients with stage A1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate was followed for 5 to 23 years (mean 8.2 years). Of these patients 52 underwent a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate between 1977 and 1986. Progressive disease developed in 3 of the 12 patients (25%) in whom residual foci of well differentiated cancer were detected by the second transurethral resection and who did not undergo further treatment. Of the 38 patients in whom the second transurethral resection did not detect residual cancer 3 (8%) also had progressive disease. From April 1989 to December 1989, 44 patients were re-evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography and ultrasonographically guided biopsies. Of these patients 3 had locally progressive disease. Progressive disease also developed in 4 more patients. Thus, 13 of the 132 patients (10%) had either locally or systemically progressive disease after long-term followup. The interval from diagnosis of stage A1 disease to detection of progression ranged from 6 months to 20 years (mean 7 years). Ten patients underwent definitive treatment for what was believed to be locally progressive disease, 2 underwent palliative therapy and 1 had no therapy due to poor physical condition. Of the 10 patients who underwent definitive therapy 6 are alive without evidence of disease, 2 died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease and 2 are alive with stage D1 disease. These data suggest that patients in whom a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate detects residual cancer have a high probability of progressive disease. Also, negative findings from a second staging transurethral resection may not exclude the possibility of disease progression. Expectant management of stage A1 disease is warranted but regular and long-term followup is mandatory.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the clinical characteristics of respiratory tract illness caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae. DESIGN.-Prospective clinical, bacteriologic, and serologic study. Secondarily, a matched comparison of patients with and without evidence of C pneumoniae infection (serologic titers greater than or equal to 1:64 and less than 1:16, respectively). SETTING.--Four primary care (family practice) clinics in Madison, Wis, and nearby towns. PATIENTS.--The study included 365 white males and females (mean age, 34.2 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Association of acute C pneumoniae infection with signs and symptoms of respiratory illness and the relationship of C pneumoniae antibody titer with wheezing at the time of enrollment in the study, and with the diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis. RESULTS.--Nine (47%) of 19 patients with acute C pneumoniae infection had bronchospasm during respiratory illness, and there was a strong quantitative association of C pneumoniae titer with wheezing at the time of enrollment in the study (P = .01). In the matched study, C pneumoniae antibody was significantly associated with asthmatic bronchitis after, but not before, respiratory illness (odds ratio, 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 23.4). Four infected patients had newly diagnosed asthma after illness, and four others had exacerbation of previously diagnosed asthma. There was no serologic evidence of coexisting Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or respiratory viral infection in 96% of patients with asthmatic bronchitis and asthma. CONCLUSIONS.--Some C pneumoniae antibody titers, although not diagnostic of chlamydial infection by present criteria, probably represent acute reinfection or ongoing chronic infection. Repeated or prolonged exposure to C pneumoniae may have a causal association with wheezing, asthmatic bronchitis, and asthma.\r"

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS.--M-mode echocardiograms, which were adequate for estimation of left ventricular mass, were obtained in 3922 healthy participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Measured height and weight were used to calculate body-mass index, a measure of obesity. RESULTS.--Body-mass index was strongly correlated with left ventricular mass. After adjusting for age and blood pressure, body-mass index remained a strong independent predictor of left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, and left ventricular internal dimension (P less than .01 for all). Body-mass index was associated with prevalence of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly in subjects with a body-mass index exceeding 30 kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS.--Obesity is significantly correlated with left ventricular mass, even after controlling for age and blood pressure. The increase in left ventricular mass associated with increasing adiposity reflects increases in both left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular internal dimension.\r"
