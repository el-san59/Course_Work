  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk factors for stroke in a cohort representative of middle aged British men. DESIGN--Prospective study of a cohort of men followed up for eight years. SETTING--General practices in 24 towns in England, Wales, and Scotland (the British regional heart study). SUBJECTS--7735 men aged 40-59 at screening, selected at random from one general practice in each town. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Fatal and non-fatal strokes. RESULTS--110 of the men had at least one stroke; there were four times as many non-fatal as fatal strokes. The relative risk of stroke was 12.1 in men who had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) and were current smokers compared with normotensive, non-smoking men. Diastolic blood pressure yielded no additional information, and former cigarette smokers had the same risk as men who had never smoked. Heavy alcohol intake was associated with a relative risk of stroke of 3.8 in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease had an increased risk of stroke, but only when left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography was also present. CONCLUSIONS--Systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography in men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease were found to be the major risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. Heavy alcohol intake seemed to increase the risk of stroke in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of strokes should be preventable by controlling blood pressure and stopping smoking.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To determine the prevalence of asthma in the past 12 months in Melbourne schoolchildren aged 7, 12, and 15 years and to compare the prevalence of a history of asthma with that of 26 years ago. DESIGN--A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was distributed to children for completion by parents and return to the school. Subjects were selected by a stratified cluster design. SETTING--Government and non-government schools in the greater Melbourne area, Australia. SUBJECTS--10,981 children. Parents completed questionnaires for 3324 children aged 7, 2899 aged 12, and 2968 aged 15. The overall response rate was 90%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History of wheeze or asthma in the past 12 months and in lifetime. RESULTS--The prevalences of wheeze in the past 12 months were 23.1%, 21.7%, and 18.6% for 7, 12, and 15 year olds respectively. A history of wheeze was more common in boys than in girls at age 7 (443/1711 v 324/1614) and 12 (418/1767 v 322/1718) but not at age 15. Overall, 78% (1548) of those reporting wheeze also reported a history of asthma and 83% (1611) had used a bronchodilator. The prevalence of a history of asthma among 7 year olds was 46% compared with 19.1% in the 1964 survey, an increase of 141%. CONCLUSIONS--The current prevalence of asthma in Melbourne schoolchildren is high and has risen substantially over the past 26 years.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To identify aspects of outpatient referral in which general practitioners', consultants', and patients' satisfaction could be improved. DESIGN--Questionnaire survey of general practitioners, consultant orthopaedic surgeons, and patients referred to an orthopaedic clinic. SETTING--Orthopaedic clinic, Doncaster Royal Infirmary. SUBJECTS--628 consecutive patients booked into the orthopaedic clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Views of the general practitioners as recorded both when the referral letter was received and again after the patient had been seen, views of the consultants as recorded at the time of the clinic attendance, and views of the patients as recorded immediately after the clinic visit and some time later. RESULTS--Consultants rated 213 of 449 referrals (42.7%) as possibly or definitely inappropriate, though 373 of 451 patients (82.7%) reported that they were helped by seeing the consultant. Targets for possible improvement included information to general practitioners about available services, communication between general practitioners and consultants, and administrative arrangements in clinics. Long waiting times were a problem, and it seemed that these might be reduced if general practitioners could provide more advice on non-surgical management. Some general practitioners stated that they would value easier telephone access to consultants for management advice. It was considered that an alternative source of management advice on musculoskeletal problems might enable more effective use to be made of specialist orthopaedic resources. Conclusion--A survey of patients' and doctors' views of referrals may be used to identify aspects in which the delivery of care could be made more efficient. Developing agreed referral guidelines might help general practitioners to make more effective use of hospital services.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the excess aluminum sulphate accidentally added to the local water supply in north Cornwall in July 1988 had an adverse effect on the outcome of pregnancies. DESIGN--Outcomes of all singleton pregnancies in the affected area at the time of the incident (n = 92) were compared with those in two control groups: pregnancies in this area completed before the incident (n = 68) and pregnancies in a neighbouring area (n = 193). SUBJECTS--Mothers in the three groups, among whom there were 13 miscarriages, five terminations of pregnancy, and 336 live births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fetal and perinatal loss, birth weight, gestation, obstetric complications, neonatal condition, and congenital defects. RESULTS--Among 88 pregnancies in women exposed to excess aluminum sulphate there was no excess of perinatal deaths (n = 0), low birthweight (n = 3), preterm delivery (n = 4), or severe congenital malformations (n = 0). There was, however, an increased rate of talipes in exposed fetuses (four cases, one control; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--Because of small numbers it is not possible to say that high doses of aluminum sulphate are safe in pregnancy, but there is no evidence from this study of major problems apparent at birth.\r"

DESIGN--Family histories were obtained from an existing computerised database and supplemented by postal questionnaires. SETTING--Diabetic service of a provincial teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--A total of 1326 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes who had been referred to diabetic clinics over the past 10 years and from whom data had been collected for inclusion in the database, of whom 347 had affected first degree relatives. Nineteen non-white patients were excluded because of the differential hereditability of the disease, and 230 (70%) patients with an affected first degree relative responded to the postal questionnaire. RESULTS--Mothers were implicated in significantly more cases than fathers in patients with a single affected parent: 125 mothers and 48 fathers from database; 82 mothers and 34 fathers from postal questionnaire; p less than 0.001 in both cases. CONCLUSIONS--Maternal influences seem to have an important role in the inheritance of non-insulin dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To review the management of and outcome in asthmatic children using home nebulisers under hospital supervision. DESIGN--Postal questionnaires sent to parents. SETTING--Paediatric departments of a children's hospital and a district general hospital. SUBJECTS--Parents of 93 asthmatic children who had been loaned home nebulisers for administration of bronchodilators with verbal instructions on their use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Drugs administered with nebuliser, side effects, frequency of hospital admission, and theoretical management of a severe attack. RESULTS--84 children took salbutamol and 37 received more than 10 mg a day during attacks; side effects were reported in 54 children. Parents of 16 children said that they would give another dose of bronchodilator rather than seek medical help if their child failed to respond to the first dose. Since being loaned nebulisers 65 children were admitted to hospital less frequently and 16 were not readmitted; over two thirds of parents thought that there had been a marked improvement in their child's asthma. CONCLUSIONS--Home nebulisers are valuable in childhood asthma. Excessive doses of bronchodilators may be given, however, and a weight related dose may be more appropriate. Parents should be given written as well as verbal instructions, especially regarding the management of severe attacks.\r"

DESIGN--Survey of general practitioners' referrals to hospital outpatient departments during one week. SETTING--One health district. SUBJECTS--All (160) general practitioners in the health district. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Specialty of the referral, the reason for it, and its status (NHS or private) and the general practitioner's assessment of the degree of pressure exerted by the patient for the referral (much, little, or none). RESULTS--122 (76%) general practitioners completed the survey. Younger general practitioners (aged less than or equal to 45) and those qualifying in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland reported greater pressure from patients to refer (p less than 0.03, p less than 0.001 respectively). Pressure was also greater for patients referred privately (p less than 0.001), for those referred for reassurance (p less than 0.05), and for those referred to clinics in psychiatry, rheumatology, dermatology, and orthopaedics. General practitioners with a higher referral rate (with total consultations in the week as the denominator) were more likely to report pressure (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--The pressure from patients to refer reported by general practitioners is related both to general practitioners' characteristics and to the nature of the referral. Pressure to refer seems to explain some of the variation in referral rates among general practitioners.\r"

  ".U": "91255768\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To assess the accessibility of invasive investigation and revascularisation procedures in the management of coronary heart disease in a defined population in the South West Thames region over 10 years, and to audit the performance of both the NHS and the private sector. DESIGN--Analysis of all patient referrals to the regional cardiothoracic centres for coronary heart disease during 1979-88. SETTING--North West Surrey District Health Authority, which had a mean catchment population of 205,000 during the study period. The health district is one of the 13 in the South West Thames region. PATIENTS--823 patients aged 34-80 years with suspected coronary heart disease, 204 of whom were referred for private investigation and 619 were referred within the NHS. The NHS referrals were mainly to St Thomas's Hospital during 1979-83 and to St George's Hospital during 1984-8. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Difference in time to investigation and intervention between the NHS and the private patients. RESULTS--After some variation in earlier years the mean (SD, range) waiting times from referral to cardiac catheterisation and then revascularisation increased progressively in NHS patients, to 115.8 (126.5, 22-482) days and 305.9 (164.4, 22-620) days respectively in 1988. There was no significant change over the 10 years in waiting times within the private sector, with a mean of 17.2 (18.2, 1-62) days to angiography and 22.8 (14.5, 2-152) days to surgery. Fifteen people on the NHS waiting list died of probable cardiac causes. No people on the private waiting list died. CONCLUSIONS--The performance of the NHS system in South West Thames region in response to emergency referral is adequate. The waiting time to routine investigation and revascularisation is prolonged and seems to be worsening despite increased investigative and surgical activity by the regional centre. The delays may subject NHS patients to unnecessary risk, which is not shared by private patients.\r"

Subjects--32,580 subjects (19,734 men and 12,846 women) born in the three major hospitals in Jerusalem during 1964-71 and subsequently drafted in to the army. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between birth weight and blood pressure at age 17 and weight and height at age 17 and blood pressure. Results--Diastolic and systolic blood pressures were associated with birth weight in both young men and young women, but the correlation coefficients were low. A high body weight at age 17 (greater than 66 kg for women, greater than 75 kg for men) rather than a low birth weight (less than 2500 g) was linked with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both men and women (p less than 0.01). Conclusions--Intrauterine environment, as reflected by birth weight, has little effect on blood pressure in young men and women. Modification of factors which lead to excess weight during adolescence may have a major role in preventing hypertension in adults.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effectiveness of a two tier neonatal screening strategy for cystic fibrosis, which combines estimation of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis in dried blood spot samples collected at age 5 days. DESIGN--Prospective study of two tier screening strategy. The first tier of testing immunoreactive trypsinogen concentration was measured in dried blood spot samples from neonates aged 4-5 days. In the second tier direct gene analysis to detect cystic fibrosis mutations deltaF508 and deltaI506 was performed in those blood spot samples which produced the highest 1% of immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Direct gene analysis was also performed on blood spot samples from infants with suspected or confirmed meconium ileus, regardless of the immunoreactive trypsinogen value. SETTING--The South Australian Neonatal Screening Programme, operating from the department of chemical pathology at Adelaide Children's Hospital. Subjects--All 12,056 neonates born in South Australia between December 1989 and June 1990. No selection criteria were applied. INTERVENTIONS--All infants found to have two recognised cystic fibrosis mutations on direct gene analysis were referred directly for clinical management, and those with one recognised cystic fibrosis mutation were recalled for a sweat test; their families were given genetic counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Direct or exclusion of cystic fibrosis by sweat testing of neonates identified as being at high risk of cystic fibrosis on screening and of those at minimum risk but whose subsequent clinical history raised suspicion about the disease. RESULTS--Of the 12,056 infants screened, 11,907 (98.8%) were reported as \"cystic fibrosis not indicated\" on the basis of low immunoreactive trypsinogen values. Of the 148 (1.23%) infants with raised immunoreactive trypsinogen values and one (0.008%) with meconium ileus, 132 (1.09%) were reported as cystic fibrosis not indicated, four (0.033%) were identified as having cystic fibrosis, and 13 (0.108%) were recalled for sweat testing after direct gene analysis for the presence of the deltaF508 and deltaI506 cystic fibrosis mutations. No cases of affected infants are known to have been missed to date. CONCLUSION--The strategy of measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by direct gene analysis is a highly specific neonatal screen for cystic fibrosis, requiring only 2.8 families to be contacted for every case of cystic fibrosis diagnosed.\r"

The superior sagittal sinus was stimulated electrically and its effect on caudal brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord blood flow and metabolism evaluated. This caused increased metabolic activity and blood flow in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, in the cervical dorsal horn and in a discrete area in the dorsolateral spinal cord at the second cervical segment. Responses in these 3 areas were blocked by ablation of the trigeminal ganglia. The dorsolateral area activated in the spinal cord corresponds to a group of cells in or near the lateral cervical nucleus that may form an important relay for craniovascular nociception and thus be of relevance to the mechanism of headache.\r"

In group 1, small MRI lesions and correspondingly small plaques, most of which were chronic, were detected histologically in 5 brains. In 4 brains there were more extensive areas of both abnormal signal and histological plaques which were more often active (group 2). However, in a further 5 brains extensive MRI abnormalities were observed when only small periventricular plaques were present histologically (group 3). Lesions in the hindbrain and cerebral grey matter were infrequently observed by MRI. The extensive MRI abnormalities seen in areas in which only small histological plaques were found may be the result of vascular permeability changes in the normal-appearing white matter surrounding plaques.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined three issues related to the processing of spatial relations by commissurotomized subjects. One issue was concerned with the respective competence of the disconnected cerebral hemispheres at performing judgements of relative position and distance between 2 objects appearing at varying locations in the visual space. Contrary to recent suggestions, the results showed that the two hemispheres were equally competent at representing categorical and coordinate spatial relations and at operating on these representations. The second issue was concerned with the capacity of the two disconnected hemispheres to operate conjointly. The subjects were simultaneously presented with the same information in the two visual fields and were required to produce a single response based on this information. Compared with unilateral presentations, bilateral presentations resulted in enhanced response accuracy and, depending on the type of decision, in patterns of response latency and accuracy different from the patterns of either unilateral condition. These results suggest that the two disconnected hemispheres can operate simultaneously and are able to join the outcomes of their respective operations before the production of a single response. The third issue was concerned with interhemispheric communication of visuospatial information. Unlike pattern information that is typically confined to the hemisphere that receives it in the commissurotomized brain, visuospatial information could be subjected to interhemispheric comparison as a function of its categorical and metric properties, although the patients had only implicit knowledge of part of the transferred information. Implications of these findings for the contribution of the hemispheres to visuospatial processing and for the understanding of the functioning of the commissurotomized brain are discussed.\r"

Several factors at presentation were significantly associated with an adverse outcome including older age at onset, male sex, cerebellar involvement or insidious onset of a motor deficit as first symptom. Factors ascertained later which were associated significantly with a worse outcome, even after controlling for those previously mentioned, included persisting deficits in brainstem, cerebellar or cerebral systems, a higher frequency of attacks in the first 2 yrs after onset of disease, a short first interattack interval and higher DSS at 2 yrs and 5 yrs from onset. An analysis similar to multiple regression was used to generate predictive models which permit the calculation of the median time to DSS 6 for patients with a given set of covariates. The goodness of fit of these models to the data and their predictive accuracy are discussed.\r"

For these patients, we determined the observed frequency of deterioration by 1 point on the disability status scale (DSS) of Kurtzke, which is the most feasible and frequently used endpoint in clinical trials. We calculated the number of patients required for a randomized clinical trial to detect a significant result (alpha = 0.05) with 80% or 90% power based on the observed rate of deterioration. To assess the linearity of the DSS, we determined the frequency of progression and staying time at each level of the DSS. Overall the frequency of progression was lower and the staying times were longer at higher levels of disability. There was considerable intrapatient as well as interpatient variation in staying time. These data have major implications for the design and conduct of clinical therapeutic trials in MS.\r"

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in 4 male Macaca fascicularis monkeys, and the development of the disease followed using quantitative MRI at 0.15 Tesla. Serial scans were recorded daily, beginning at day 9 after inoculation. Lesions were detected before the onset of clinical signs, due to an elevation in the spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation times. The T1 and T2 values from the lesions were shown to increase over time, indicative of progressive change at a molecular level. The appearance of any new lesions and any changes in existing ones were noted; this allowed dating of the lesions postmortem. Pathological correlation showed the long T1 and T2 values to be associated with the presence of inflammation, demyelination and haemorrhagic necrosis. Microscopically similar lesions had the same MRI characteristics. In addition, these studies showed the oldest lesions to be the most haemorrhagic; this is contrary to the belief that haemorrhage is a secondary event in EAE. The results show that quantitative MRI is sensitive to variable pathology, and has the potential for use in characterizing the pathological progression in MS.\r"

  ".W": "Thermoregulation was investigated pre and postoperatively in 5 and only preoperatively in 7 patients with suprasellar pituitary adenomas by exposing them to external cold and heat in a climatic chamber. Five healthy subjects served as controls. Body core and skin temperatures, oxygen consumption, electromyographic activity, skin blood flow and local sweating rates were continuously measured. Threshold temperatures for activation of heat production and heat loss were calculated from these data. Hormone analysis was performed before and after stimulation with releasing factors. In the patients, core temperatures as well as threshold temperatures for heat production and heat loss were elevated by about 0.5 degrees C as compared with controls. This elevation of core and threshold temperatures was achieved, despite a reduced resting metabolic rate, by a reduction of skin blood flow indicated by a low mean skin temperature. After successful operation the thermoregulatory alterations normalized. Serum levels of growth hormone were reduced preoperatively and stimulation by GHRF did not cause an appropriate increase. Prolactin was elevated in 6 patients with prolactinomas, but there was no correlation with changes in thermoregulatory threshold temperatures. Stimulation of the other hypophyseal hormones by the combined anterior pituitary function test revealed a normal hormonal response. Apart from prolactin there were no significant hormonal changes postoperatively. It is concluded that disturbances of temperature regulation are present in patients with suprasellar adenomas, but that they are not detectable by routine clinical methods. These alterations probably depend on a disturbance of hypothalamic function and are reversible by surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with schistosomiasis of the spinal cord are described. They fall into two groups: 7 patients had clinical and computer-assisted myelographic evidence of lesions in the conus medullaris or cauda equina, or both. The clinical picture in the remaining 7 patients was usually that of acute or subacute transverse myelitis with normal or equivocal CT myelographic appearances. Granulomas containing bilharzial ova were found in 2 female patients with conus swelling subjected to laminectomy and biopsy. In 1 of these the ova were identified as S. haematobium while in the second, unidentified bilharzial ova were found. A presumptive diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis was made in the remaining 12 patients based on characteristic clinical and investigative profiles. All 13 patients tested showed evidence of bilharzial infection based on positive blood serology or the detection of bilharzial ova, or both. All but 1 patient showed at least one of the following abnormalities on CSF examination: pleocytosis, an elevated protein content and as indicated by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands, an elevated IgG index and an increased CSF IgG synthesis rate. A CSF bilharzia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, developed to indicate the presence of schistosomal infection within the theca, was found to be sensitive although not entirely specific for the diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis. Eleven of the 14 patients showed rapid clinical improvement, 8 after praziquantel and corticosteroid treatment, 2 after operation and 1 spontaneously. Significant reductions in the CSF cell count, protein concentration and bilharzia ELISA titre, and in intrathecal antibody production, occurred following praziquantel and corticosteroid therapy. The CSF sugar level showed a significant rise. A reduction in conus size was observed in 3 patients when CT myelography was repeated after medical therapy. The normalization of most of the laboratory parameters after combined medical treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids, together with clinical and radiological improvement, strengthened the presumptive diagnosis of cord schistosomiasis and supports the policy of early intensive medical treatment (as opposed to surgical therapy) for this condition when diagnosed on indirect evidence.\r"

All patients scored well on tests of perception, language and intelligence and 2 performed well on a variety of other tests of frontal lobe function. Explanations for their difficulty on the multiple subgoal tasks in terms of memory or motivational problems could be excluded. It is argued that the problem arose from an inability to reactivate after a delay previously-generated intentions when they are not directly signalled by the stimulus situation.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the basal temporal language area produced a global receptive and expressive aphasia with speech arrest at high stimulus intensities. Other higher cortical function, for example copying complex designs or memory of nonverbal information was intact, in spite of the total inability to process verbal information. At lower stimulus intensities partial aphasias with a predominant receptive component occurred. Surgical resection of the basal temporal language area produces no lasting language deficit.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed postmortem on the brains of 40 patients aged over 60 yrs who had died from causes other than brain disease. Periventricular lesions of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, graded as moderate or severe, were found in 10% of the patients in the age group between 60 and 69 yrs, and in 50% between 80 and 89 yrs. Macroscopic and microscopic whole-brain sections were studied in 19 brain specimens (8 with normal white matter, 4 with moderate lesions and 7 with severe lesions of the white matter on MRI). The presence or absence of periventricular lesions on MRI correlated well with the severity of demyelination and astrocytic gliosis. Demyelination was always associated with an increased ratio between wall thickness and external diameter of arterioles (up to 150 microns). A variable degree of axonal loss in Bodian-stained sections was present in the white matter of all brains with demyelination. Dilated perivascular spaces were found and studied morphometrically in 9 brain specimens; their presence correlated strongly with corrected brain weight, but incompletely with demyelination and arteriolosclerosis. Our findings suggest that arteriolosclerosis is the primary factor in the pathogenesis of diffuse white matter lesions in the elderly. This is soon followed by demyelination and loss of axons, and only later by dilatation of perivascular spaces.\r"

Anterior horn cell ubiquitin-immunoreactive (IR) inclusions were present in all of 31 ALS cases but in none of 23 neurologically normal and in only 1 of 22 neurologically abnormal controls. These inclusions, which were present in familial and sporadic ALS cases, and in cases with dementia, took the form of dense rounded or irregular ubiquitin-IR cytoplasmic inclusions (dense bodies), or loosely arranged bundles ('skeins') of filamentous-appearing material. The presence of ubiquitin-IR inclusions corresponded to the pattern of selective neuronal vulnerability in ALS, although inclusions in pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex were infrequent and were noted in only a minority of cases. Ubiquitin-IR inclusions were more prevalent than Bunina bodies. The latter were present in 67% of ALS cases but were seldom labelled by antibodies to ubiquitin. Intraneuronal inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were present in 23% of ALS cases and were often identified by antibodies to ubiquitin. We conclude that the presence of ubiquitin-IR inclusions in lower motor neurons represents a characteristic pathological feature of ALS in its various clinical forms. Ubiquitin-IR inclusions in ALS differ from ubiquitinated inclusions in other neuronal degenerations in that they are not readily identified by antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins. They may represent accumulations of altered or abnormal neuronal proteins resistant to degradation via the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway.\r"

We located this patient 40 yrs after injury and performed a detailed reevaluation. The patient demonstrated persistent deficits in visual recognition, characterized most prominently by defective recognition of elemental shape and form, associated with alexia, prosopagnosia, visuospatial disorientation and impaired visual imagery. Visual acuity, colour recognition, writing ability and verbal intelligence were relatively preserved. Isolated bilateral occipital injury was demonstrated by CT and MRI scanning. On comparison with previously reported cases, our results support the hypothesis that carbon monoxide toxicity can induce a visual agnosia of the apperceptive type with well defined characteristics, seldom seen with other types of cerebral injury. Prognosis for long-term recovery is poor.\r"

Animals with acute EAE were examined for comparison. In animals with CREAE an approximately linear relationship was found between the mean number of lesions enhancing with Gd-DTPA seen per MRI slice and the severity of clinical disability at relapse. In addition, a direct relationship was seen between the duration of clinical relapse and the duration of enhancement with Gd-DTPA for lesions associated with the relapse. Lesions studied in animals having entered a progressive phase of disease showed the most sustained BBB breakdown. These observations suggest that BBB breakdown is important in the development of clinical signs in inflammatory demyelination. In CREAE, areas of focal enhancement with Gd-DTPA could usually be clearly defined at a time of clinical relapse. In slices free of focal lesions, no abnormal Gd-DTPA leakage could be detected using a quantitative method. In contrast, in acute EAE no focal lesions were visible, but significant leakage was detected by measurement. No change was found in T2 relaxation times in CREAE or acute EAE. The pattern of BBB breakdown in inflammatory demyelination evolves from a diffuse shortlived disturbance in acute EAE to a more focal and prolonged breakdown in animals with chronic relapsing and progressive disease. The broad similarities in the pattern of BBB breakdown seen in CREAE and multiple sclerosis support the hypothesis that the initial vascular changes in the human disease are due to inflammation which could be mediated immunologically.\r"

  ".W": "Endemic cretinism is the most severe manifestation of dietary iodine deficiency. Two forms of the syndrome are traditionally described: neurological and myxoedematous. Although this classification highlights the important neurological sequelae of the disorder it implies that myxoedematous cretins have an alternative mechanism. Further, the nature of the neurological deficit associated with both types of endemic cretinism has received scant attention in recent times considering that it remains a common disorder in many parts of the world. The nature and extent of the neurological deficit found in endemic cretinism was investigated in 104 cretins from a predominantly myxoedematous endemia in western China and in 35 cretins from central Java, Indonesia, a predominantly neurological endemia. We found a similar pattern of neurological involvement in nearly all cretins from both endemias, regardless of type (myxoedematous or neurological), and of current thyroid function. Hallmarks of the neurological features included mental retardation, pyramidal signs in a proximal distribution and extrapyramidal signs. Many patients exhibited a characteristic gait. This probably reflected pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction, although joint laxity and deformity were important contributing factors. Other frequently encountered clinical features were squint, deafness, and primitive reflexes. Cerebral computerized tomography (CT) revealed basal ganglia calcification in 15 of 50 subjects. The presence of basal ganglia calcification was confined to cretins with severe hypothyroidism. Otherwise, cerebral CT scanning demonstrated only minor abnormalities which did not contribute to the localization of the clinical deficits. We conclude that the same neurological disorder is present in both types of endemic cretinism reflecting a diffuse insult to the developing fetal nervous system. These clinical findings support the concept of maternal and fetal hypothyroxinaemia, arising from severe iodine deficiency, as the primary pathophysiological event in endemic cretinism. Differences between the two types of cretinism may be explained by continuing postnatal thyroid hormone deficiency in the myxoedematous type, which results in impaired growth, skeletal retardation and sexual immaturity.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the degeneration of lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a transneuronal event, secondary to the loss of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, the cross-sectional areas of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the foot and tongue areas of the precentral gyri were measured in 12 cases of the classical sporadic form of ALS, and in 10 control subjects. The areas of motor neurons in the hypoglossal nuclei and in the ventral horns of segment L4 of the spinal cord were also measured. The number of neurons per 20 microns section of ventral horn or hypoglossal nucleus provided a more reliable index of severity of lower motor neuron loss at the time of death than did a semiquantitative score derived from clinical observations. Cortical neurons and lower motor neurons were significantly smaller in the cases of ALS than in the controls. In the cortex this change included, but was not confined to, the largest neurons. These observations indicate that shrinkage precedes neuronal death. There was no correlation, positive or negative, between the numbers of surviving lower motor neurons and the mean sizes of pyramidal cells in layer 5 of the corresponding areas of the precentral gyri. The absence of such a correlation indicates that functionally related cortical and lower motor neurons probably degenerate independently, and not from a transsynaptic effect. Neuronal shrinkage has been observed in other diseases in which interconnected systems of neurons degenerate. The possible association of shrinkage with cytoskeletal degradation is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families.\r"

All three groups showed a loss of large and small myelinated nerve fibres in sural nerve biopsy specimens which was greater in Groups 1 and 2. Regenerative activity was prominent in all three groups, but least in Group 3. Teased fibre studies showed evidence both of axonal regeneration and remyelination. Active fibre degeneration was rare. Measurements of g ratio (axon diameter:total fibre diameter) gave no indication of axonal atrophy. The density of unmyelinated axons was reduced in all three groups, as was their median diameter. Vibration sense threshold was positively correlated with the total number of myelinated fibres and thermal sensory threshold with median unmyelinated axon diameter but not with total unmyelinated axon numbers. No correlation between the occurrence of pain and active degeneration of myelinated fibres or with regenerative activity either in myelinated or unmyelinated axons was detectable. Assessment of differential loss of large or small myelinated nerve fibres was difficult because of the presence of large numbers of small regenerating myelinated axons. The results are discussed in relation to the concept of 'diabetic small fibre neuropathy' and the causation of pain in diabetic neuropathy.\r"

Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of compression-ischaemia nerve block on psychophysical thresholds for warm sensation and heat-induced pain was studied on 19 normal human volunteers. Although those two sensory submodalities should be predicted to block simultaneously, based on the fact that both are served by unmyelinated primary afferents, it was actually found that warm sensation was much more vulnerable to compression-ischaemia than heat-induced pain. This is interpreted as resulting from different summation requirements for each of the two sensory modalities; sensation of warmth depends on spatial summation to a larger extent than heat-induced pain. Such differential vulnerability is in line with recent clinical studies reporting deterioration of warm sensation associated with preservation of heat pain in peripheral nerve disorders caused by diabetes, ageing and other neuropathic processes.\r"

  ".W": "Morphological and functional studies have been performed on experimental vitamin E deficient rats. The predominant morphological change was axonal dystrophy and degeneration in the rostral parts of the dorsal columns, particularly in the gracile fasciculi. The dystrophic changes comprised focal axonal swellings containing accumulations of normal and abnormal organelles which included tubulovesicular structures probably derived from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, dense lamellar bodies, neurofilaments, multifascicular bodies and lysosomes. Similar but lesser changes were observed in distal peripheral nerves. The appearances suggested a disturbance of axonal transport with a defect of 'turnaround' in the distal axons. Studies on the axonal transport of endogenous acetylcholinesterase showed an impairment both of fast anterograde and retrograde transport. The changes were considered to be secondary to the lack of the antioxidant effect of vitamin E as the neurological deficits could be reduced by the concomitant dietary administration of the synthetic antioxidant ethoxyquin and were markedly aggravated by the administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is suggested that the neurological syndrome produced by vitamin E deficiency could be the result of damage to the function of mitochondria and other intra-axonal membranous structures which would interfer both with fast anterograde transport and 'turnaround' and lead to a distal axonal degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated genetic and environmental influences in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing age of onset in 99 sibling pairs concordant for the disease. We used three methods of analysis: (1) comparison of mean differences in age of onset and year of onset, (2) linear regression of differences in age or year of onset vs difference in ages, and (3) intraclass correlation of age of onset which is also used for monozygotic twins concordant for MS. Comparison of the mean differences in age of onset or year of onset is found to be inappropriate and potentially misleading. No significant results were found in linear regression of the age of onset or year of onset vs differences in ages, although a trend towards onset at the same age is present. However, nontwin siblings show a significant intraclass correlation for age of onset (P less than 0.01) as is seen in genetic disorders. A stronger intraclass correlation in age of onset in concordant monozygotic twins vs concordant sibling pairs further suggests that age of onset is partly under genetic control, assuming common exposure to an environmental agent. The results give little support for common exposure to an environmental trigger in concordant MS sibling pairs. They are consistent with a mixture of random independent exposures and common exposures leading to the development of the disease, with the former predominating.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether reported physiological distinctions between prefrontal (PF) and premotor (PM) areas reflect true dissimilarity or instead result from technical considerations such as differences among species, individuals, or behavioural, physiological and anatomical techniques. A Rhesus monkey performed a task involving 2 stimulus events on each trial: the first stimulus appeared briefly, then after a delay period, 2 peripheral stimuli appeared simultaneously. The monkey had to delay responding for an additional, self-timed instructed delay period, then contact a touch pad beneath the peripheral stimulus of the colour matching the first stimulus. PM and PF cortex differ in several respects. More PF than PM neurons discharge during the presentation of the first stimulus, and only PF neurons show phasic bursts of activity shortly after that stimulus disappears. During the instructed delay period, cells in PF begin activity earlier than PM neurons, whereas PM neurons continue their activity longer. Similarly, PF cells show greater discharge modulation early in the instructed delay period compared with PM cells, which discharge more intensely later. Cells with apparent selectivity for stimulus characteristics appear only in PF. Thus our results support the view that PM and PF have distinctive physiological properties that cannot be accounted for by technical considerations alone. In addition, we describe the activity cells in a cortical region, here termed the dorsomedial frontal cortex, which has a distinctive dysgranular cytoarchitecture and has physiological properties that ally it with PF.\r"

  ".U": "91256007\r", 
  ".W": "The pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) were examined in three kinds of mutant rat; the zitter (zi/zi; Zi), the tremor rat (tm/tm; Tm) and the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) which is a double mutant carrying both zitter and tremor genes. Two major alterations demonstrated in these mutants were hypomyelination and vacuolation or spongy degeneration. Hypomyelination was observed predominantly in SER and to a lesser extent in Zi, and was accompanied by a redundant or aberrant myelin sheath formation in addition to a decreased number of myelinated fibres. This appeared to be related to the occurrence of tremor. There was no abnormality in the structure of the myelin lamellae and oligodendrocytes or any destruction of myelin sheaths by phagocytic cells. The number of radial components in CNS myelin was increased almost equally in Zi, Tm and SER. Vacuolation was prominent in SER and Tm, especially in the brainstem and thalamus. Zi also developed mild vacuolation with advancing age. Vacuolation seemed to be related to the epileptic phenomena in SER and Tm. Vacuoles consisted mainly of swollen astrocytic processes and enlargement of the extracellular space, as well as occasional enlargement of periaxonal spaces. Thus both pathological findings--the hypomyelination derived from the zitter mutation with tremor, and the vacuolation from the tremor mutation with epileptic symptoms--were mutually exaggerated in SER. It is postulated that the two different genetic loci with zi and tm mutations interact and synergistically reinforce each other both clinically and pathologically in SER.\r"

This relationship should be considered in the newborn or young infant, faced with a sudden life-threatening event, and in the older child or adult presenting with chronic head and neck complaints, either unexplained or unresponsive to adequate medical therapy. A causal relationship may be difficult to establish, based first on clinical expertise as a guideline, on laboratory tests, among which pharyngeal pH monitoring could be promising, and on response to medical antireflux therapy. A better understanding of the significance of high levels of reflux and defective acid clearance, as well as a more precise knowledge of the maturation and functioning of upper airway protective mechanisms, would open the way to more accurate diagnostic procedures, to a more reliable definition of the abnormal, and to greater efficiency in the management of these patients.\r"

By June 1990, 2425 men not previously suspected of having prostate cancer had been examined in ten participating clinical centers according to the project protocol. Three hundred ninety-six men (16.3%) were recommended for biopsy on the basis of TRUS or DRE. An analysis of the results of 330 completed biopsies showed 52 cancers detected by DRE and/or TRUS. Forty-four (84.6%) of the men with cancer had positive TRUS examination results compared with 33 (63.5%) with positive DRE. Five additional cancers were discovered as a result of elevated PSA levels. The overall detection rate was 2.4% and this rate varied by age. The detection rate in men 55 to 60 years of age was 1.3% and this rose to 3.3% in men older than 65 years of age. The estimated sensitivity was significantly greater for TRUS compared with DRE (77.2% versus 57.9%; P less than 0.05). The estimated specificity of DRE was greater than that of TRUS (96.3% versus 89.4%; P less than 0.01). The positive predictive value (PPV) for the tests varied as a function of patient and disease characteristics. The overall PPV was 28.0% for DRE and 15.2% for TRUS. The occurrence of elevated PSA levels significantly increased the PPV of both TRUS and DRE. The majority of cancers detected were at early stages. These preliminary data suggest the feasibility of using these techniques to promote cancer control, but additional data and follow-up are needed to assess the significance of the results.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or alpha-interferon therapy were included in this study. Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission.\r"

Thirteen partial responses (11%) and 5 regressions (4%) of evaluable disease were obtained for the 116 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (C) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5% to 21.5%). The median time to progression was 2.2 months and the median survival time was 4.6 months for 5-FU plus C.

The median time to progression was 2.8 months and the median survival time was 5.6 months for 5-FU, C, and V. The 5-FU and C doses were equivalent in the two treatment regimens. Sixteen of 85 patients (19%) with a performance status of 0 and 18 of 103 patients (17%) with a performance status of 1 responded, whereas only 2 of 44 patients (5%) with a performance status of 2 or greater responded (P = 0.009). Patients who had received locoregional radiation therapy had a lower overall response rate then those in the no prior radiation therapy group (P = 0.028). The median survival time for patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 was 6.3 months compared with 1.9 months for patients with a performance status of 2 or greater (P less than 0.001). Performance status also appeared to be a significant factor for time to progression. More frequent and severe leukopenia, fever, genitourinary (GU) toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity was reported with 5-FU, C, and V. There were three treatment-related deaths with 5-FU, C, and V and one treatment-related death with 5-FU plus C. Grade III/VI myelotoxicity was not influenced by prior radiation therapy or performance status. Neither regimen is active enough to be considered as standard therapy for advanced NSCLC.\r"

Thirty previously untreated patients (27 men and 3 women) with a median age of 59 years were included in this study. Twelve patients had one metastatic site and 18 had two or more metastatic sites. The median performance status was 80%. The chemotherapy (CT) regimen administered during the course of this study consisted of carboplatin (300 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (4 g/m2) plus mesna every 4 weeks. All 30 patients were evaluable: 1 achieved a complete remission (CR) and 18 achieved a partial remission (PR) (objective response rate, 63%). The median response time was 3 months and the median survival time was 8 months (range, 1 to 25+ months). Bone marrow toxicity was Grade III in three patients and Grade IV in four patients. The carboplatin and ifosfamide combination was well tolerated. No cross-resistance with the doxorubicin and etoposide regimen was established because 4 of 11 patients responded to this combination (+/- cisplatin) after failing to respond to the ifosfamide and carboplatin regimen. The ifosfamide and carboplatin combination may be considered for inclusion in non-cross-resistant alternating CT schedules.\r"

The drug schedule was as follows; 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin both given intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 3 to 4 weeks. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 6 objective partial responses (25%; 95% confidence limits, 9.77% to 46.71%) were observed. Twelve of 24 patients (50%), including 6 with no radiologic evidence of response, had a clinical improvement as demonstrated by an objective reduction of symptom or performance status scores along treatment. The overall median survival time was 10 months. Toxicity was mild and dose reductions or suspensions were not required. The combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin is effective and well tolerated. It might be considered for palliation of symptomatic patients with DMPM.\r"

Seventeen patients with measurable metastatic disease were entered into the trial and treated with idarubicin at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2. This dose was escalated or reduced according to toxicity. There were no documented responses. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. These data did not compared favourably with the data on doxorubicin in the treatment of gastric carcinoma. A conclusion could not be reached on whether idarubicin has minimal activity in the treatment of gastric carcinoma.\r"

Except for the AMD administration, treatment for all patients followed that of the latter study. Patients were randomized to receive either of the two AMD regimens in the schedules most appropriate for their stage and histologic condition. One hundred seventy-six children with WT entered the study until December 1988. No significant differences in overall or relapse-free survival distributions were observed between treatment arms using data for all patients or data stratified by disease stage. Two-year survival rates were 83.0% and 85.3% for patients receiving the fractionated and single doses of AMD, respectively. Survival distributions could also be compared once patients with protocol violations were excluded. The overall 2-year survival rates were 89.7% and 88.6% and the relapse-free 2-year survival rates were 78.2% and 76.1% for the fractionated and single AMD doses, respectively. Altered liver function was seen in three patients who received fractionated dose and in four patients who received the single AMD dose. Acute toxicity was observed in only one patient of the fractionated-dose group and in zero of the patients of the single-dose group. At the closing date, patients assigned to the simplified AMD regimen had accumulated 1840 days less of hospital stay than those treated by the standard regimen.\r"

Treatment could be evaluated in 13 patients. The overall response rate was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 54%). A complete remission, which lasted for 42 months, was achieved in one patient. Partial remissions, which lasted for 6 and 11 months, were achieved in two patients. Cardiotoxicity appeared in three patients, myelotoxicity in four, and nephrotoxicity in one. This confirms that this regimen is an active combination for the treatment of metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma.\r"

A potentially important descriptor is the pattern of tumor growth as reflected in the dissolution of preexisting or deposition of newly formed basement membrane (BM) around tumor cell nests. The possible correlation between the pattern of BM deposition and patient survival was investigated. Immunohistochemistry testing, using polyclonal antibodies to human type IV collagen, was done on tumor samples of 68 patients with operable Stages I or II SqCLC, and BM staining was scored semiquantitatively. More than 75% immunoreactivity was scored as extensive BM and less than 75% as moderate or limited BM. In six patients, no immunoreactivity could be detected. In 27 of 62 patients, extensive and, in 35 of 62 patients, moderate-limited BM deposition was found. This deposition had a significant effect on survival (P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis, including BM deposition and tumor stage, indicated that BM deposition might also have value as an additional independent prognostic indicator for survival (P = 0.02). Deposition of an appreciable amount of BM in the center of the SqCLC was a prognostically favorable sign, independent of tumor stage.\r"

In patients subjected to splenectomy, advanced stages of the malignancy were more frequent and metastasis was noticed in 8.1% of splenic hilar lymph nodes and in 10.1% of the lymph nodes associated with the splenic artery. A univariate analysis revealed that the survival time of patients with splenectomy was significantly less than those for whom splenectomy was not done (P less than 0.05). In a subgroup of our patients stratified to adjust for the stage of disease, there was no significant difference between the survival rates. Subsequently, multivariate analysis using the Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other covariates indicated that serosa invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size were the most important prognostic factors, and there was no correlation whatever with splenectomy. Our findings rule out any relationship between splenectomy and length of survival time in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer.\r"

For this purpose, it is necessary to elucidate the biologic properties of the cancer to take reasonable measures. Autopsy findings of patients who died of recurrence may offer a reliable guide. Autopsy findings were studied in 14 patients: eight who had undergone curative resection and six who had received noncurative resection. Cancer recurred at the liver hilum with invasion into adjacent organs. Peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastases were infrequent. These were common findings in both curative and noncurative resection groups. Cancer cells in the connective tissue of the hepatoduodenal ligament may play a major role in recurrence.\r"

The variables examined included age, race, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), Gleason score of the radical prostatectomy specimen, and pathologic stage. No significant relationships were found between DNA ploidy and age, mean PAP value, and absolute PAP value. Of the 112 patients, 65 (58.0%) had disease limited to the prostate (pathologic Stages A and B); 47 (42.0%) had extraprostatic disease (pathologic Stages C and D1). The stage was related to the Gleason score (P less than 0.0001) where extraprostatic disease was associated with a Gleason score of 6 to 10. Nineteen (17.0%) patients had aneuploid tumors, and 93 (83.0%) had diploid tumors. DNA ploidy significantly correlated with pathologic stage (P = 0.04); aneuploidy was identified more frequently in patients with Stages C and D1 tumors. Aneuploid tumors occurred more frequently than diploid tumors in patients with a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P = 0.034). Mean PSA values were higher in patients with aneuploid tumors (P = 0.078), extraprostatic neoplasms (P = 0.00001), and cancers with a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, PSA values greater than 10.0 ng/ml were associated with extraprostatic disease and a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Significant racial differences were found with respect to DNA ploidy, mean DNA indices, and mean PSA values. The 18 black patients had more DNA aneuploid tumors (P = 0.043), a higher mean DNA index (P = 0.017), and a higher mean PSA value (P = 0.043) than the 94 white patients. Both PSA and DNA ploidy analysis by flow cytometry appear to be valuable indicators in the evaluation of patients with prostatic carcinoma.\r"

Previously, others have demonstrated that the loss of normal cell surface antigens, such as ABO(H) blood group antigens or beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been correlated with more aggressive behavior by tumor. In this study, using immunohistochemical techniques, the authors evaluated the initial pretreatment biopsy specimen of bladder tumors for the presence of ABO(H) antigens and B2M. Data from this sample patient population, all with biopsy-proven STCB, indicate that expression of these two markers is predictive of a therapeutic response to prophylactic intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) after resection, and that expression of the two markers is of greater predictive value than expression of either antigen alone.\r"

Tumor biopsy specimens from 42 melanoma patients were examined for the ratio and found that GD3 and GM3 constitute 80% of the total lipid bound sialic acids (LBSA) of melanoma. Although the ratio of GM3:GD3 in melanocytes, the progenitors of melanoma, is 19:1 (based on %LBSA), it ranged from 15:1 to 1:5 in tumor biopsy specimens. Patients are categorized into three groups based on their GM3:GD3 ratio (%LBSA) of tumor tissues as Group I (ratio ranged from 15:1 to 1.5:1) (10 of 42), Group II (1.4:1 to 1:1.4) (13 of 42), and Group III (1:1.5 to 1:5) (19 of 42). When the overall survival of patients from the onset of Stage II disease was evaluated among different groups, patients belonging to Group I survived significantly longer than patients of Group II (P = 0.02) and Group III (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Group III expressed immunogenic gangliosides (GD2, GM2, and O-AcGD3) better than the other groups and may benefit more from therapies targeted against these gangliosides antigens. The results of this study indicate that GM3:GD3 ratio is an unusual but well-defined biochemical criteria that may be useful for prognosis and therapeutic management of the disease. Therefore, we propose a routine analysis of the GM3:GD3 ratio of tumors excised after surgery. Screening the ratio is feasible since melanoma expresses a simple profile of gangliosides unlike other forms of cancer.\r"

Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control. Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma. Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type. Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type. These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO. Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors.\r"

Deletion of an expected A, B or H antigen occurred in 12 (24.5%) of the 49 superficial carcinomas and three (21.4%) of the 14 advanced carcinomas. Incompatible expression of an unexpected A or B antigens occurred in only one case (1.6%) in the carcinoma. In the clinicopathologic study, there was a significant correlation between immunoreactivity of Lewisa and depth of cancer invasion (chi-square test, P less than 0.05). In the superficial carcinoma, there were significant correlations between immunoreactivity of Lewisx and lymph node status (chi-square test, P less than 0.05), immunoreactivity of Lewisy and prognosis (Z test, P less than 0.05), and incompatible expression of Lewisb for tumor against nontumorous epithelium and histologic variation (chi-square test, P less than 0.01). The functional significance of alternations in BGA expression that may be associated with oncogenesis is not clear. However, immunohistochemical determination of BGA may be a more advantageous marker to predict the patient's clinical course in superficial esophageal carcinoma.\r"

The histologic appearance of the tumor was a mixture of tubular adenocarcinoma cells and hepatoid neoplastic cells, and there was a resemblance to hepatoid adenocarcinoma. The intraoperative level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was calculated to be 2246 ng/ml, and the postoperative level ranges from 183.6 to 285.6 ng/ml. Lectin binding assays showed that the serum AFP was the hepatic carcinoma type. In a hepatoid portion, an iron-negative, brown to green pigment was positive for bile. Alpha-fetoprotein was immunohistochemically evident in the neoplastic cells. In addition to the hepatic differentiation, the tumor had differentiated into intestinal absorptive or pancreatobiliary tract cells, as deduced from the frequent presence of spicular bodies, a unique light microscopic feature equivalent to microvilli with an actin core. The hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a distinct type of AFP-producing carcinoma present in the organs with epithelium of endodermal origin. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma in the renal pelvis may arise from a metaplasia of neoplastic mesonephric cells into endodermal cells.\r"

By AR immunohistochemical study using an antibody specific for AR the authors assessed nuclear AR content specifically in the malignant epithelial cells of prostate needle biopsy specimens of 17 patients with Stage D prostate cancer. The authors found that prostate cancer contains AR-positive and AR-negative malignant cells before androgen withdrawal therapy, but the percentage of AR-positive cells did not predict the time to tumor progression after therapy. There was no significant correlation between the percentage of AR-positive malignant cells and the time to tumor progression. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median time to progression, the percentage of AR-positive nuclei was not significantly different in poor responders versus good responders. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median percentage of receptor-positive nuclei, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the progression-free interval revealed no significant difference between the group of patients with AR-poor tumors and patients with AR-rich tumors. Potential explanations for these results are discussed. The authors conclude that the percentage of AR-positive nuclei is not a sufficient criterion to predict tumor behavior.\r"

  ".W": "Reliable predictors of response for prostate cancer patients undergoing hormonal therapy are lacking. This study investigates the possibility that tumor proliferation rates might predict tumor behavior for these patients. The growth fraction of metastatic prostate cancer biopsy specimens obtained before androgen withdrawal therapy was evaluated by Ki-67 antibody immunohistochemical study to determine whether a higher tumor growth fraction was associated with a shorter time to tumor progression after therapy. The percentage of Ki-67-positive malignant epithelial nuclei in the primary tumors of 17 patients ranged from 1.7% to 7.5% (median, 2.5%). When patients were divided into two response groups according to the median time to progression, poor responders (time to progression less than 20 months) and good responders (greater than or equal to 20 months) had similar growth fractions (3.5 +/- 0.5% versus 3.1 +/- 0.6% Ki-67-positive nuclei, respectively). However, when patients were divided into two groups based on the median growth fraction, patients with a high growth fraction (greater than 2.5% Ki-67-positive nuclei) tended to have a shorter time to progression (median, 10 months) than patients with a low (less than 2.5%) growth fraction (median time to progression, 25 months), although statistical significance was not reached. Despite this interesting trend, Ki-67 immunostaining was not accurate to predict the time to progression in individual patients undergoing hormonal therapy. Reliable prediction of growth rates may require measurement of both cell proliferation and cell death rates.\r"

  ".W": "The authors assessed a panel of immunohistochemical stains against 109 pediatric solid tumors, primarily rhabdomyosarcomas, under the auspices of the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study. Fresh tumor tissue received from participating organizations was divided into portions that were either frozen or fixed in formalin, alcohol, or B5. Immunostaining was performed by the avidin-biotin complex method using monoclonal antibodies to desmin, neurofilaments, vimentin, cytokeratin, and leukocyte common antigen on cryostat sections. Tissue was also embedded in paraffin and stained with antimuscle-specific actin (MSA) and polyclonal antibodies to desmin, creatine kinase M subunit (CKM), myoglobin, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Antidesmin staining of cryostat sections was the most sensitive indicator of rhabdomyosarcoma (58 of 62 specimens positive). Results with this reagent in alcohol-fixed and formalin-fixed tissue were similar (46 of 56 positive versus 43 of 56 positive, respectively) and comparable with results with anti-MSA in formalin-fixed tissue (43 of 55 positive). However, the proportion of cells stained by antidesmin was higher in alcohol-fixed tissue than in formalin-fixed tissue. Staining with antimyoglobin and anti-CKM was much less satisfactory, with positivity rates of 17 of 37 and 11 of 57, respectively, in formalin-fixed rhabdomyosarcomas. Immunostaining of muscle markers revealed evidence of myogenesis in six undifferentiated sarcomas and in two sarcomas with inadequate histologic study on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. However, positivity was also noticed in samples of fibromatosis, Wilms' tumor, ectomesenchyoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, renal rhabdoid tumor, myositis ossificans, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and embryonal sarcoma of the liver. The authors conclude that combined use of antidesmin and anti-MSA enhances the diagnosis of childhood sarcomas, especially when employed with other techniques such as electron microscopic study.\r"

Myeloid antigen-positive acute lymphoid leukemia was observed in the leukemic cells of eight (16%) individuals. No significant differences were observed between conventional and aberrant ALL in the distribution of sex, age, leukocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, blast count, French-American-British (FAB) type, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, rate or duration of remission, or survival. When only myeloid antigen-positive cases were compared with myeloid antigen negative-cases, no significant correlations were observed except for duration of first remission (myeloid antigen positive, 26+ +/- 22 months; myeloid antigen negative, 40+ +/- 18 months; P less than 0.001), and duration of survival (myeloid antigen positive, 27+ +/- 24 months; myeloid antigen negative, 62+ +/- 17 months; P = 0.001). These data suggest that pediatric patients with ALL blasts possessing myeloid antigens may represent a high-risk group for length of remission and survival.\r"

Four hundred and sixty-nine patients (29.9%) had well-differentiated tumors, 677 (43.2%) were moderately and 420 (26.8%) poorly differentiated. Eighty-one percent of the patients had surgicopathologic Stage I disease, 11% Stage II, 6% Stage III, and 2% Stage IV. Mean age at diagnosis was 62.1 years (range, 36 to 91). The crude 5-year and 10-year survival rates for all patients were 74.1% and 62.2%, respectively. Five-year crude survival was 86.8% for Grade 1 and 58.3% for Grade 3 tumors. The 5-year crude survival for patients with intramucosal tumors was 88.7% as opposed to 46.9% for patients with tumors infiltrating to the serosa. Sixty-six percent of the patients with vessel invasion survived for 5 years in contrast to 88.6% for patients without vessel invasion. Histologic grade, myometrial infiltration, vessel invasion, and lymphocyte reaction surrounding the tumor were strongly interrelated. Multivariate analysis showed that the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis was the most important single prognostic factor. Disregarding age, survival in operated patients was more dependent on the depth of myometrial invasion than on grade and stage of disease.\r"

The mean relative optical densities obtained for each sample group showed an increase from normal epithelium, through CIN grades, to invasive cancer. Although there was some overlap between groups, the difference in the overall mean values between the adjacent groups was statistically significant. The sensitivity of the test was 87.1% with a specificity of 99.2% and a predictive value of 99.5%, with no false negatives in the severe dysplasia and cancer groups. Quantitative data allows the threshold value to be altered to vary the sensitivity and specificity according to prevailing requirements. This suggests the possibility of using quantitative acid-labile DNA measurements to improve existing screening for cervical precancer.\r"

Under the Cox proportional-hazards model (with quality of life, marital status, and their interaction in the model), a statistically significant relationship was observed between initial patient-rated quality of life and subsequent survival. In addition, being married led to a significantly improved survival.

Effusion cells were cryopreserved before and during DM installation for subsequent determination of ploidy by flow cytometry. Pleural effusion in all three patients with advanced breast cancer resolved and did not reaccumulate throughout follow-up for 11+, 10+, and 8+ months. Pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer and in two of four patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin partially resolved. Altogether six of ten patients (60%) subjectively and objectively benefited from this therapy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no local or systemic side effects. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in ploidy of effusion cells in all three patients with breast cancer, from a peak mean channel of 6C to nearly 2C after therapy. Transient reduction of ploidy was seen also in the effusion of a patient with unknown primary tumor associated with clinical improvement. The clinical and laboratory data reported offers initial evidence that DM when instilled into the pleural cavity after incomplete thoracentesis may act as effective palliative therapy either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents.\r"

They comprised diffusely proliferating anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli. Some of them contained melanin pigments in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein and ultrastructurally showed melanosomes. In addition, several benign pigmented lesions resembling dermal nevus, pigmented schwannoma, or cellular blue nevus were present in the dermoid cyst, one of which contained a malignant melanomatous component. Histologic transition between benign and malignant components and the presence of another small focus of atypical melanocytes in the benign lesion suggested that the malignant melanoma arose in close association with the previously existing benign pigmented lesions in the dermoid cyst.\r"

Patients whose diagnosis was based on bone marrow plasmacytosis (greater than 30%) were noticed to have poorer survival (P less than 0.001). Although classification of patients according to stage has traditionally been used to identify prognostic groups, differences in survival were noted only between Stage III and Stage I or II patients using one of two common staging systems. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model identified the following prognostic factors in order of importance: plasmacytosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 3.27), hypercalcemia (HR = 1.68, CI = 1.22 to 2.32), hypoalbuminemia (HR = 1.51, CI = 1.15 to 1.99), alkaline phosphatase (HR = 1.62, CI = 1.18 to 2.23), hyperuricemia (HR = 1.46, CI = 1.09 to 1.96), and renal insufficiency (HR = 1.48, CI = 1.08 to 2.04). All patients were followed from 2 to 7.5 years and 130 (49%) survived over 2 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hyperuricemia, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, plasmacytosis, gender, alkaline phosphatase, and hypercalcemia were significant predictors of 2-year survival. Knowledge of these factors could be of value in predicting prognosis and planning therapy in patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

  ".W": "To define better the evolving entity of dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN), studies correlating clinical with histologic features of DMN are essential. However, based on a literature search, no previous quantitative analysis was found of the relationship between gross morphologic features and histologic features of DMN. The authors correlated individual clinical features with histopathologic features and histologic diagnosis of the clinically most atypical nevus in 153 melanoma patients. This nevus was identified, evaluated clinically, and removed for histologic evaluation from each patient. Gross morphologic features assessed for nevi included: size (in mm), the presence of a macular component, irregular border, ill-defined border, haphazard coloration, distortion of skin cleavage lines on tangential lighting, asymmetry, and number of colors present (12 features in all). Nineteen histologic features were assessed in each nevus by a single dermatopathologist. These included architectural, nuclear, and cytoplasmic parameters ascribed to dysplastic nevi. Each of these histologic features was correlated with the 12 individual clinical features. Seventeen percent of the nevi fulfilled the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of DMN. Among individual nevus parameters, size (in mm), irregular border, ill-defined border, macular component, and pink color were associated significantly with histologic DMN. Nevus size (in mm) and irregular borders correlated with the greatest number of individual histologic parameters. A comparison of clinicopathologic correlations for two different examiners revealed that certain clinical features are probably more important than others for the recognition of dysplastic nevi and that individual examiners have different thresholds for the perception of some gross morphologic features. These observations are relevant to the development of clinical criteria for dysplastic nevi.\r"

Several studies have found an association between hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis documented at pathology. Late changes attributed to atherosclerosis that were observed at angiography were also significantly related to elevated serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. They also were found in association with diabetes, systemic hypertension, and smoking in some studies. Several clinical studies have documented an association of one or several coronary risk factors with postoperative clinical events, including recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, reoperation because of clinical deterioration, and survival. These factors have been shown to act alone or in combination. The most important is an abnormal lipid profile and diabetes. Smoking and hypertension were seldom found to be significant predictors when considered separately, but appear to play an important role in association with the others. Control of coronary risk factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and smoking, seems mandatory in order to prevent SVG atherosclerosis and progression of the disease in the native coronary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Bypass graft stenosis and occlusion are relatively common events, occurring eventually in the majority of patients who survive beyond 5 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These processes, in combination with progressive native coronary artery disease, lead to recurrent angina and an increased need for medication in most patients late after surgery. Patients with unstable ischemic symptoms generally should proceed directly to coronary arteriography, whereas patients with stable angina may be candidates for noninvasive testing to evaluate their risk and the extent of myocardial jeopardy. If the initial revascularization procedure is successful, preoperative thallium 201 imaging abnormalities should be reversed. Persistent abnormalities beyond 6 months after revascularization indicate incomplete revascularization or perioperative infarction. Defects noted in the immediate postoperative period may be areas of myocardial stunning or hibernation, which can require up to 6 months to reverse. If chest pain recurs after revascularization, a normal thallium 201 perfusion pattern indicates that the symptom is probably not ischemic in nature. Thallium 201 perfusion abnormalities may precede symptoms by several months and may be the only indication of significant myocardial ischemia in patients with silent ischemia. Advanced tomographic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), should theoretically improve disease detection and localization following revascularization. Practically speaking, only the left anterior descending coronary bed is well evaluated by these tomographic imaging techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT imaging for evaluation of posterior circulation abnormalities remains unacceptably low. Complexities of competitive flow and collateralization that may exist in the postoperative period make it difficult to relate perfusion abnormalities to a specific graft stenosis. However, tomographic perfusion imaging may provide useful correlative information on the functional impact of bypass graft stenoses in patients with recurrent angina who have undergone coronary angiography and in whom the angiographic indications for repeat surgery or angioplasty are not compelling. Newer tomographic and metabolic imaging techniques such as CT, NMRI, and PET remain unproven as diagnostic tests for the evaluation of unselected patient populations presenting with recurrent angina following revascularization surgery.\r"

Although newer agents provide hope for greater capability of preventing renal dysfunction, their cost may prevent their broad availability in the black hypertensive population (see Chapter 5). Judicious use of traditional therapies, combined with newer approaches when possible, may offer prescribing physicians the best opportunity to control blood pressure in ways to avoid renal dysfunction. The lessons of the past 20 years have taught us that lowering blood pressure by any means helps in reducing target organ damage. More recent observations in hypertensive blacks illustrate the need for improved therapies to prevent renal dysfunction. A more physiologic approach to blood pressure control in the black patient that conserves perfusion to the kidney may delay the development of nephrosclerosis. Increased awareness, educational support, and encouragement will be necessary to insure compliance with therapy for a disease that is largely asymptomatic.\r"

From clinic-based high-risk counseling to broad-based school or community programs, intervention strategies are being developed and tested to find the most effective means of changing the risk factors of youth to assure a healthier future for our children. Since adoption of new behaviors is improved by consistent messages from multiple sources, a concerted effort is needed. The involvement of health professionals, educators, community organizations, industry, and government together will be important to support the adoption of healthy lifestyles for succeeding generations. Intervention through cardiovascular health promotion for school children may well be the future direction for preventive cardiology.\r"

  ".W": "Development of strategies to prevent CHD in blacks is impeded by the virtual absence of clinical trials demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of interventions in blacks. The wholesale generalization that interventions effective (or ineffective) in whites are similarly effective in blacks may risk the employment of worthless or even dangerous interventions in blacks. Using available epidemiologic data, a number of risk factors may be more important in blacks than whites by virtue of higher prevalence, increased relative risk, or both. These may include hypertension, lipoprotein (a), smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Thus, health agencies might emphasize these risk factors when developing preventive programs targeted at black populations. Prevention programs may best seek to prevent the onset of risk factors found highly prevalent in black communities, rather than the costly and side-effect-prone interventions to treat risk factors once established. Thus, there is a role for community-based as well as a high-risk approaches. The community-based approaches should seek to work with organizations such as churches, which traditionally play strong roles in the black community. Physicians treating black patients should be aware of the potentially different roles played by risk factors, and treat aggressively those individuals identified to be at high risk. Risk factor management should be emphasized, rather than reduced, in patients with already established CHD. CHD has been clearly shown to be preventable; both blacks and whites should benefit from specific interventions aimed toward this worthy goal.\r"

At present, the prognosis is not good in the majority of cases; despite the best medical therapy, most of those with cardiomyopathy are doomed to death within a few years after the onset of congestive heart failure. Many of these are young African-American men in the prime of their lives. Cardiac transplantation offers some hope from this desperate situation, but donor shortages as well as restrictive criteria for prospective recipients and socioeconomic constraints, which may deny many blacks the opportunity to receive a transplant, make this option less than ideal.\r"

The natural history of CHD differs between blacks and whites in three important respects: First, greater prevalence of established risk factors among blacks suggests that they may be at greater risk for heart disease than their white counterparts. Second, health care seeking differences are evident between blacks and whites, leading to lower rates of identification of early disease and slower seeking of services for acute events. However, risk factor differences and health care seeking behaviors do not appear to account for all of the differences in the natural history of heart disease between the ethnic groups, such as survival rate differences during treatment. Economic factors appear to account for only a portion of these differences in risk factors and health care seeking. Beyond differences in risk factors and health care seeking, other, as yet undetermined, factors seem to be involved. These unknown influences could include physiologic, behavioral, and/or psychologic differences.\r"

Surgical mortality is easily attributable to the usual iatrogenic variables or comorbid disease.

Ischemic heart disease is as yet distinctly uncommon in these societies but the adoption of Western lifestyle and its inevitable risk factors for atherosclerosis makes it likely that coronary artery disease will emerge ultimately. Hypertension poses special problems in these regions--its prevalence rate is high both in rural and urban settings, its consequences devastating in its severity of target organ involvement, and its management strategy complicated by the high cost of drugs, poor patient compliance, and the lack of clinical resources for effective monitoring of detected and referred cases. Rheumatic heart disease remains an eminently preventable condition. The ultimate strategy lies in improving the quality of life in these communities through adequate housing, sanitation, and health education, and integrating primary prophylaxis into national health care programs to forestall the development of rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy poses the greatest challenge as its etiology remains elusive. Its dilated form has been linked with Toxoplasma and with Coxsackie B viruses, but hard evidence of a cause-effect relationship is still lacking.\r"

  ".W": "Although the decline in stroke and other cardiovascular morbid and mortal events has been occurring since the 1940s, the steeper decline since 1968 has been attributed to improved hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. However, in spite of this encouraging trend from the population in general, surveys from the 1970s and our more recent survey from the Maryland Hypertension Program indicate that hypertension control among blacks remains unacceptably poor, particularly in view of the high prevalence. Of special concern are black men, who have the highest prevalence of any group and the poorest control rate (see Tables 6-1 through 6-4). According to Gillum and Gillum, \"High rates of non-compliance with follow-up and drug therapy seriously compromised the efforts of community-wide programs. Indeed, non-compliance with therapeutic or preventive health advice is now the major barrier to effective hypertension control in the United States.\" Impediments to ideal hypertension control in black communities can be divided into three categories 1. Severity of hypertension in blacks. 2. Barriers related to the medical care system, including inadequate financial resources (see also Chapter 5), inconveniently located health care facilities, long waiting times, and inaccessibility to health education, specifically as it relates to hypertension. 3. Barriers related to the social, psychosocial, and sociopolitical environment, which include problems of underemployment, unemployment, racism, and strained racial relationships. In summary, one could say that, in spite of generally improved hypertension control in the United States, the group that has the worse problems (blacks, especially males) is not benefiting as much as the general population. The strategy for treating black patients with hypertension is little different from that applied to all other patients. However, consideration must be given to the patients' lifestyle. The cultural differences in diet especially must be taken into account. Finally, economic considerations must always be an important component in managing black hypertensive patients. For a detailed discussion of treatment alternatives, see Chapter 11.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, for reasons that are not clear, some persons seem to be extremely good at retaining sodium on a high-sodium diet or poor at excreting sodium on a high-sodium intake. This is more frequent in Western hemisphere blacks than in whites in the West or in blacks in Africa. These geographic/ethnic differences in sodium handling ability may be related to environmental factors or, more likely, to inherited differences in the ability to conserve sodium based on the evolutionary principle of survival fo the fittest for the ability to conserve sodium. The frequency of this salt-conserving (thrifty) genotype in Western hemisphere blacks may have been further increased as a consequence of severe selection pressures for survival based on the ability to conserve sodium during the slavery period of history in the West. One characteristic of the blood pressure control systems of Western hemisphere blacks is suppression of plasma renin activity without suppression of aldosterone production. In addition there is greater nephrosclerosis in blacks than whites and a more rapid decline in creatinine clearance with age. When more sodium is ingested than the kidneys are able to handle (excrete), there is a (transient) slight positive sodium balance; as a result sodium, chloride, and water are retained, resulting in an expansion of plasma volume (Fig. 7-3). The initial physiologic responses include (increased) secretion of atrial natriuretic peptides and the digitalis-like substance (natriuretic hormone), and inhibition of vasopressin and aldosterone secretion. The net effect is directly enhanced natriuresis and diuresis, and a reduction in plasma volume, with no significant effect on blood pressure. However, if there is a continuing tendency to sodium retention and volume expansion, the capacity of the aforementioned mechanisms to control plasma volume will be exceeded; then, the chronically elevated level of the digitalis-like substance will inhibit the sodium pumps in the arterial and venous smooth muscle cells and in the sympathetic neurons. The increased venous tone will help to reduce plasma volume directly by reducing central venous volume. Arterial tone will be increased by direct action of the digitalis-like substance on the arterial smooth muscle and, indirectly, via the hormone's action on the sympathetic neurons. Initially, of course, blood pressure will be maintained in the normal range (but will be labile) because of the compensating cardiovascular reflexes. Once the capacity of these reflexes to control blood pressure is exceeded, however, the blood pressure will begin to rise; this will induce a pressure natriuresis to help restore plasma volume to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of nine knees was obtained at the follow-up examination to evaluate lesion and bone peg incorporation, evidence of lesion loosening, and the articular cartilage. Eight good to excellent, one fair, and one poor result were obtained clinically. MR imaging showed 33% of knees had poor lesion cartilage and 44% had partial or poor lesion incorporation possibly consistent with loosening. Complications included four partial defect healings, one tibial donor graft-site fracture, and one bone peg loosening. Four symptomatic knees had follow-up arthroscopy at an average of 1.8 years postsurgery and findings included four loose bodies, one loose peg, one meniscal tear, and one symptomatic hypertrophic synovium. MR imaging was a useful tool in evaluating lesion stability, articular cartilage quality, lesion and bone peg incorporation, the menisci, and cruciate ligaments. Bone peg fixation of large osteochondritis dissecans defects of the knee offers a physiologic approach to treatment of this lesion in nearly skeletally mature or skeletally mature patients.\r"

Seventy-seven of the patients sustained complete lesions and 58 sustained incomplete lesions. Anatomically, 19.3% of the injuries were in the cervical region, 51.8% in the thoracic, and 28.9% in the thoracolumbar. In 93 cases, the neurologic level was at least one level higher than vertebral level of injury. Although twice as many individuals were shot from the back as from the front and from the left as from the right, the point of bullet entry did not appear to be related to the severity of the injury. At the annual follow-up examinations, 66.7% of the patients with complete lesions and 64.0% of the patients with incomplete lesions had no improvement in the neurologic level of injury. Nevertheless, there was a significant (p less than 0.0001) improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association motor index scores one year after injury.\r"

These were compared with similar measurements obtained from symptomatic normal feet of women of a similar age distribution. The hallux valgus angle was associated with medial deviation of the first metatarsal measured by all three of the parameters defined and tested, i.e., the intermetatarsal, metatarsus primus varus, and metatarsus omnis varus angles. Of these, the best measure was the intermetatarsal angle, which in the hallux valgus feet differed significantly from controls more than the other measurements. No evidence was found to support any concept of second metatarsal deviation from normal.\r"

The follow-up period ranged from 2.3 to 66 months, with a median of eight months. At the final follow-up examination, the motion in the AFO-treated group was not functionally different from that of the cast-treated group. However, 72% of the patients treated in an AFO compared with 37% of patients treated in a cast had ankle dorsiflexion greater than 15 degrees (p = 0.014). No complications were directly related to the AFO. No loss of reduction occurred in any patient. The results of this series indicate that early motion of a fractured ankle treated operatively does not affect ankle motion. Early motion was not associated with increased morbidity or loss of reduction.\r"

In patients with more than two years' evaluation, 75.5% had normal ankle movement and 71.1% had normal inversion and eversion of the foot. In the knee joint, the incidence of residual joint stiffness was small and the amount of stiffness was clinically insignificant.

This organism can cause fatal infection in domestic animals and are probably transmitted to humans by soil contamination of skin abrasions, ingestion, and inhalation. Melioidosis is being increasingly diagnosed in Western countries in other than its endemic areas of tropical and subtropical zones. In the past, only a few single case reports of articular melioidosis were published in English journals, and almost all were secondary to melioidosis of another organ. Accurate diagnosis of this infection is important because a high mortality rate is usually associated with the septicemic form. Nine cases of isolated articular involvement were diagnosed between 1984 and 1988 in Northeast Thailand. Symptoms were subtle and diagnosis required a high degree of suspicion. Diagnosis depended on bacteriologic methods including Gram's stain, pus and blood cultures, and on an indirect hemagglutination titer of over 1:40. In addition to general measures for septic arthritis, antibiotic therapy using a combination of intravenous cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol was generally satisfactory. Second line drugs (i.e., more effective but also more expensive drugs that the authors administered when patients failed to respond to the first line drugs cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol) comprising intravenous ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole were administered in cases with an underlying disease. Comparison of the disease course before and during hospitalization as well as the total days of treatment between two small groups of patients with and without underlying disease revealed no statistically significant difference.\r"

Ten patients had only the vastus intermedius excised (Group A), 30 patients had excision of the vastus intermedius plus either the vastus medialis or lateralis (Group B), nine patients had only the rectus femoris spared (Group C), and 16 patients had the entire quadriceps excised or conversion of the previous arthrodesis (Group D). Based on the rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, satisfactory results were obtained in 70% of Group A patients (30% excellent and 40% good), with no poor results. In group B, 80% had good or excellent results and 7% poor results. In Group C, 78% of the patients had good results but no excellent results, whereas Group D had only 50% satisfactory results. The parameters that most often led to functional impairment were restricted motion and inadequate extensor powers. Muscle transfers, however, (flexors to extensors) were effective only in Group C patients. With proper technique and prosthetic design, satisfactory results can be achieved after distal femoral resection and prosthetic reconstruction, even after extensive quadriceps excision.\r"

At the time of surgery, the smokers were on average 6.4 years younger than the nonsmokers. The review revealed no discrepancy between smokers and nonsmokers with regard to amputation level, the BK to AK ratio being 2:1. In cigarette smokers the risk of infection and reamputation was 2:5 times higher than in cheroot smokers or nonsmokers. The poor results obtained in cigarette smokers may be ascribed to the fact that this group of patients smoked during the phase of healing and that only cigarette smokers tend to inhale. Inhalation of smoke leads to high concentrations of nicotine, which compromise the cutaneous blood-flow velocity and increase the risk of the formation of microthrombi. Consequently, amputees should abstain from cigarette smoking during the phase of healing. Preferably, the habit should be broken one week before surgery, which is the requisite period for the process of coagulation and the fibrinogen level to normalize and for free radicals to be eliminated.\r"

One limb of each animal was immobilized, and the contralateral limb was placed in a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine for three weeks. Joint stiffness of each ankle was quantified with an arthrograph before injury and after three weeks of treatment. Hindlimb volumes were recorded before injury and monitored at weekly intervals using a water-displacement method. Joint stiffness increased 2.6 times the preinjury levels in limbs that were immobilized for three weeks. There was no statistically significant increase in joint stiffness in ankles treated with CPM compared to preinjury values. The posttraumatic difference between the CPM-treated and immobilized limbs was highly significant; limb swelling was not affected by CPM.\r"

Eight new cases with nine fractures are reported in this study. The critical features are the frequent delays in diagnosis (three of eight patients) and the high rate of immediate and delayed neurologic deficit (seven of eight patients). Two fracture patterns occurred in this group. The first type occurred through the midportion of an ankylosed segment of the spine and involved the vertebral body (five fractures). The second type occurred at the top or bottom of a fused segment (four fractures). The latter were disk disruptions or odontoid fractures. This is a marked difference from spinal fractures in ankylosing spondylitis, in which the majority are transdiskal fractures. The difference can be explained on the basis of the different pathology of these two disease processes. Careful evaluation of patients with DISH who sustain trauma is critical. Treatment of this rare injury should be early stabilization of the spine to avoid complications of nonunion, deformity, neurologic injury, and death.\r"

In the initial experiment, antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately following injection of Staphylococcus aureus into the proximal tibial metaphysis. A single intramedullary injection of microencapsulated ampicillin (100 mg) prevented osteomyelitis in all seven animals tested and was as effective as a two-week course of parenteral ampicillin administration. When antibiotic therapy was delayed for seven days, osteomyelitis developed in four of eight animals treated locally with microencapsulated ampicillin and in six of eight animals that received parenteral ampicillin therapy. When antibiotic therapy was delayed for seven days and was preceded by debridement, all ten animals treated locally with microencapsulated ampicillin had sterile bone cultures. In contrast, seven of ten animals treated locally with unencapsulated ampicillin powder developed osteomyelitis. Biodegradable antibiotic-loaded microspheres may be of clinical benefit for the local treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.\r"

The four preparations were tested in orthotopic, 8-mm calvarial wounds to compare the quantity of new bone that formed 28 days postimplantation. Quantitative computer imaging was used to measure roentgenographic gray levels and bone volume of new trabeculae (calcified plus osteoid). All experimental bone matrix derivatives produced more bone volume than the nontreated control wounds. Bone volume regenerated from iAAA was significantly less than eAAA and DBM-regenerated bone.\r"

The techniques currently used to monitor a patient's response to fluoride are outlined. New findings concerning (1) a mechanism for interaction of fluoride with osteoblasts (via mitogenic signals or growth factors); (2) toxicity and carcinogenesis; (3) recent clinical trial data; and (4) the importance of dosage, administration regimens, and side effects in an effective fluoride treatment protocol are reviewed. Some recent clinical data challenge the efficacy of fluoride in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Because of the implications of these recent studies with respect to fracture incidence during fluoride therapy, fluoride cannot be recommended at this time for general use in the treatment of osteoporosis.\r"

Although no difference in clinical assessment (anteroposterior draw, range of motion, and function) was noted between the prosthesis reconstruction and the autograft reconstruction, the prosthesis provided a higher strength initially, which remained relatively constant over the one-year study. However, prosthesis wear was observed, with up to 50% of Dacron fibers ruptured in some cases. Histologic sections indicated that in the ovine model, the Leeds-Keio prosthesis should be considered an artificial device and not a scaffold or stent that supports aligned collagenous growth. The autograft had low strength at 12 weeks, which increased over the study period. Despite acceptable clinical performance and adequate mechanical properties up to one year postimplantation, neither reconstruction approached the clinical or mechanical performance of the normal anterior cruciate ligament in the ovine model.\r"

The effect of joint motion on repair was also evaluated. In one group, longitudinal incisions were made in the peripheral, central, and inner rim regions of the meniscus. Some of these incisions were sutured, whereas others were not repaired. In another group, transverse incisions were made in the meniscus, extending from the inner rim to the middle of the meniscus or to the peripheral attachment (radial tear). Again, the lesions were left open or repaired. The effect of joint motion on healing was assessed by immobilizing several knees from each group with Kirschner wires temporarily for ten weeks. Suture of the meniscus incision did not substantially affect the rate of healing. When the healing rates of menisci at the periphery, body, and rim were compared, incisions at the periphery healed significantly better than incisions at the meniscal body and central rim regions. K-wire immobilization did not substantially affect the rate of healing. The difference in healing with regard to the type of incision, either longitudinal or transverse, was not statistically significant.\r"

One animal given a 6-kg force and two of seven given a 4-kg force showed physeal separation. All four rabbits given a 2-kg force and five of seven given a 4-kg force did not show a greater increase in length than the control femurs. Bone growth was not stimulated by physeal distraction. Any increase in length of more than the normal growth is attributable to physeal separation.\r"

The classification is based upon current concepts of oncological surgery, the structures removed, the type of resection performed, and the relationship of the resection to the glenohumeral joint, and it indicates the increasing surgical magnitude of the procedure. Data from 38 patients with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years (range, two to 8.4 years) were analyzed. Thirty-two tumors were in bone and six in soft tissue. Eighty-seven percent (33 of the 38 tumors) were malignant. Twenty-four lesions were located in the proximal humerus and 14 in the scapula. The system permitted classification of all shoulder girdle resections done in this study's institutions. The classification is proposed as a means of establishing a uniform terminology in the comparison of such data.\r"

All patients except one had normal active motion and strength preoperatively. All patients had roentgenographically normal acromiohumeral distance and an anterior-inferior acromial osteophyte. The goal was to obtain pain relief without loss of motion of strength. This was accomplished in all patients. This study shows that normal shoulder function is possible with a massive unrepaired tear of the rotator cuff. Normal function in the face of an unrepaired cuff tear can occur only if there is a balance of two important force couples, one in the coronal plane and the other in the transverse plane. This balance depends upon the functional integrity of the anterior cuff, the posterior cuff, and the deltoid. In patients whose cuff tears satisfy these anatomic and biomechanical criteria, the achievement of pain relief through arthroscopic debridement and decompression seems to be all that is necessary for normal pain-free function.\r"

It is used acutely to rapidly stabilize the posterior pelvic ring in hypotensive patients. The simplicity of design allows the device to be applied in less than ten minutes in the emergency room. Most importantly, it does not interfere with the ability to carry out subsequent laparotomy or other required procedures. Although more clinical experience is needed, the clamp has provided hemodynamic stabilization accompanying fracture reduction. The device is not expected to be of benefit in the cases with significant bleeding of arterial origin.\r"

A second anterior fusion was done because the graft was dislodged after the patient fell out of bed one month after surgery. An esophagocutaneous fistula occurred three months after the second anterior surgery. One of the causes of this esophagocutaneous fistula was considered to be a pressure necrosis of the esophagus because of to projection of the bone graft. Conservative treatment, which consisted of wound drainage and intravenous administration of antibiotics, was tried but was unsuccessful. A good result was achieved by cancellous bone grafting, closure of the esophageal fistula, and transposition of a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap to the interspace between the esophagus and the cervical spine.\r"

One member of each matched pair was fixed with three or four 6.5-mm cancellous screws, whereas the other member was fixed with the same number of Knowles pins. Mechanical testing was performed on an Instron testing machine. There was no statistically significant difference in maximum load to failure or in fixed stiffness between the two methods of fixation. When examining maximum load to failure, three of either device provided fixation equivalent to four. Although there was a difference in absolute fixed stiffness between specimens fixed with three Knowles pins compared to four, when stiffness was expressed as a percentage of intact stiffness, there was no difference between any fixation group. From an analysis of the observed modes of failure and from calculations of the flexural rigidity provided by the devices, it is proposed that the quality of the trabecular bone of the femoral neck is a major factor in the experimental fixation of femoral neck fractures.\r"

Newly formed bone was observed in the marrow spaces and along the morselized autograft bone chips, which had been surgically placed in the medullary canal at the time of implantation. New bone was observed along 10% of the HA surface of the femoral component and 20% of the acetabular component. Some bone was also observed connecting the surrounding bone chips to the HA coating. Light microscopy showed the presence of osteoid on 20% of the femoral component and on 40% of the acetabular component. HA coating on total hip prostheses appears to enhance early skeletal attachment, which may be attributed to the osteoconductive properties of the composite.\r"

Seventy-eight percent of the respondents reported that their newborn had a rash but only 45% of those reporting a rash sought professional medical advice. Thirty-seven percent of the mothers reporting a rash made a change in bathing practice or product selection. In view of our findings, the human newborn is exposed to a large number of environmental chemicals thorough topical OTC preparations. The efficacy, transcutaneous absorption and potential toxicity of these products should be investigated.\r"

Initial interviews would encourage families to bring their children in for health supervision visits, but discourage families from making after-hour telephone calls, using the emergency room and bringing the children to the clinic frequently for problem visits. The I families had an initial interview, attended by all family members. Both a physician and a nurse elicited patient histories and explained use of the emergency room, when to make after-hour calls, how to schedule appointments and other information about the clinic. If I families failed to have an initial interview, they were deleted from the study. In the NI subgroup, patient histories were elicited during a routine health supervision visit without the entire family in attendance, and information about emergency room visits, after-hour calls and appointment scheduling was provided during the same visit. After one year (1987) into the study and two years (1988) into the study, all patient charts were examined. Data analysis was performed using analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA) and step-wise multiple regression of Statistical Analysis System. For 1987, the interview intervention explained a significant (p = 0.01) amount of variance in the number of problem visits (less in I) after controlling for months in the study and age of the child.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the Louisville Behavior Checklist, 75% of 48 children had behavior problems. Children in a battered women's shelter are likely to experience academic and behavioral problems; however, further study is needed to elucidate etiological factors.\r"

The program's impact through its first five years of operation on medical aspects of pregnancy course and fetal outcome will be the subject of a separate report. This study examines subsequent maternal and infant health of the patients attending the program compared to a control group. Four hundred ninety-eight adolescents and their newborns attending the program's mother-baby family planning clinic from 1982 to 1989 (subject group) were compared to ninety-one adolescents and their newborns receiving postpartum family planning and pediatrics clinics from 1980 through 1989 (control group). Seventy-five percent of the subject group regularly attended mother-baby clinic, compared to 18% of the control group attending family planning and pediatric clinics (P less than or equal to .0001). The subject group experienced less maternal and infant morbidity, greater school attendance, graduation, employment, and contraceptive use than the control group (P less than or equal to .0001). Many parameters improved with each program year indicating continued wide acceptance of our program by area adolescents.\r"

These 30 cases represented 88% of all cases in which EBC was isolated by blood culture (four other instances were considered contaminants); the rate of isolation of this organism relative to all positive blood cultures was 0.6%. There were 14 patients less than 12 months of age, with 10 less than 2 months of age. Infection was nosocomially-acquired in 17 cases. At the time the positive blood culture was obtained, 5 patients were afebrile, and 8 patients (five immunocompromised) had been receiving parenteral antibiotic therapy to which the organism exhibited in-vitro sensitivity for at least 24 hours. EBC was a constituent of polymicrobial bacteremia in 6 cases; in 5 instances the associated organisms were also gram-negative bacteria. There were a total of 33 underlying medical conditions or foci of infection associated with EBC bacteremia identified in 27 patients, the most common of which were immune-deficiency state (17) and gastrointestinal tract lesions (6). There were 3 patients who died. EBC bacteremia is a relatively rare pediatric infection. It is commonly nosocomially-acquired, and afflicts children who are younger-aged or compromised by underlying medical problems.\r"

Rivalry may be manifested as a verbal or physical attack, frustration, persistent demands for attention, or as regressive phenomena. When handled properly, healthy competition among siblings will lead to the acquisition of social, interpersonal and cognitive skills that are important to the development of the child. Mismanagement of the competition may lead to psychological problems later in life. The appropriate spacing of children and the preparation of existing children for a new sibling help to reduce sibling rivalry. Family situations that will potentially lead to jealousy should be avoided. Parents should not make comparisons between siblings and favoritism should be avoided. When episodes of sibling rivalry develop, the cause rather than the manifestation of the rivalry should be treated. Patience, love, understanding, common sense, and humor are important parental skills necessary to minimize sibling rivalry.\r"

In 7 cases, the allergen could not be detected. Patients who were allergic to corticosteroids were tested for their cross-sensitivity with our corticosteroid patch test series. Cross-reactions tended to occur between members of the same corticosteroid type, and some of the combinations of different corticosteroid types cross-reacted with each other. Corticosteroid-sensitive cases have increased in number during these 22 years. Corticosteroid sensitivity is not as rare as formerly thought.\r"

  ".W": "The recommended concentration for patch testing with sodium hypochlorite [NaOCl] (bleach) is 1%, generally obtained by diluting commercial bleach. In doing so, other active (potentially irritant) components of bleach, especially hypochlorous acid [HOCl] and sodium hydroxide [NaOH], are neglected. Magnitudes of potential irritant species other than NaOCl, such as alkalinity, are ordinarily not labeled on the product, though they may vary considerably between brands. Thus, patch testing with 1% hypochlorite obtained by diluting different brand bleaches can potentially elicit non-specific irritant responses, also depending upon the test volume applied. In this study, skin irritation induced by 24-h patch testing with 20 microliters or 100 microliters, with constant NaOCl concentration (1%) and different NaOH concentrations (0.01-1.0%), was studied in adult human volunteers, by means of visual scores and skin color reflectance measurements. No irritation was elicited by application of 20 microliters 1% OCl-, independent of the NaOH concentration. However, all solutions induced significant irritation in a volume of 100 microliters. Skin reactions did not show a straight pH dose response, a maximum reaction being seen to the solution containing 0.1% NaOH. Skin surface pH values had increased when monitored immediately after removal of the patch material. However, 24 h later, baseline values were again reached at most sites, demonstrating an efficient buffering capacity of human skin, even after challenge with alkaline solutions of pH 13.4. We suggest that a non-irritant concentration for diagnostic patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis with an aluminum chamber, using 17 microliters to 20 microliters test volume, could be as high as 1% NaOCl and 1% NaOH.\r"

Topical exposure of mice to 0.5% potassium dichromate in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) under occlusion resulted in specific contact sensitization in each of 7 experiments. Although sensitization to nickel sulphate under the same conditions was weak and somewhat variable, evidence for significant levels of contact allergy was obtained in 4 of 7 experiments. In addition, repeated topical application of both nickel sulphate and potassium dichromate in DMSO was found to result in the induction of lymphocyte proliferative responses in lymph nodes draining the site of exposure. These data indicate that epicutaneous exposure to both metal salts may cause specific contact sensitization in mice.\r"

This work has now been extended to a more general examination of alkyl transfer reactions. The modified single injection adjuvant test has been used to investigate the sensitization potential of C12, C16 and unsaturated C18 alkyl transfer agents. Dose responses to challenge and the patterns of cross-reactivity between these materials and methyl transfer agents have been studied. All alkyl transfer agents examined were potent sensitizers in the guinea pig. There was evidence of mutual cross-reactivity between all alkyl transfer agents examined (including methyl transfer agents). Analysis of the data in terms of a modified relative alkylation index showed evidence of an overload effect. The sensitization data has been accurately modelled using a mathematical equation. These results emphasize the possibilities for relating physicochemical parameters and skin sensitization potential. Further studies with alkyl transfer agents are in progress of amplify the observations and conclusions presented in this report. No in vitro model is available for the prediction of skin sensitization potential. Therefore an approach based on a model using physicochemical criteria is the most likely route to a reduced requirement for animal testing.\r"

One of our patients showed cross-reactivity between ketoprofen and ibuproxam on patch testing. In the photopatch tests, we observed cross-reactivity between ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid in 2 patients, and cross-reaction between ketoprofen and ibuproxam and flurbiprofen in another case. Experimental studies, including human maximization and photomaximization tests, performed in 20 healthy volunteers, showed a complete absence of sensitization, 3 volunteers showed a marked irritant reaction to ketoprofen (20% pet.) during either maximization (2 cases) or photomaximization (1 case) tests. Although ketoprofen appears not to be a sensitizing agent in human volunteers, the fact that photosensitization to this drug seems to be quite common after topical use suggests that there are some local or individual factors, at present unknown, facilitating the development of allergy.\r"

The same result was found with 7-oxode-hydroabietic acid identified earlier in rosin (3) and a polar fraction obtained from commercial abietic acid, suggesting the presence of still unidentified oxidation products. Hydroxylation of rings A or B, or conversion to the methyl esters, considerably decreases the sensitizing potential. A model is presented underlining the importance of hydrophobic and polar domains, in addition to chemically reactive groupings, in the allergen. Insertion into the lipid bilayer may play an important role in contact sensitivity.\r"

An average recovery of 88.9% for abietic acid and 88.2% for dehydroabietic acid was obtained. The lowest detectable amount of abietic acid (0.001%) corresponds to a content of 0.003% unmodified rosin in the product, assuming that the resin acid content in rosin is 90%, of which 30-50% is abietic acid. This is an acceptable limit compared to the reactivity in patients with known allergy to rosin. Technical products for analysis were supplied by different Swedish manufacturers, who also gave the approximate content of rosin in the various products. The content of rosin determined in the products was in accordance with the contents given by the manufacturers.\r"

Contamination was generally greatest in the cobalt patch test substances. To determine whether the levels of contamination encountered were sufficient to produce a false positive patch test, 20 nickel-sensitive patients were patch tested to various concentrations of free elemental nickel in aqueous solution. The level of nickel contamination was less than that required to produce a false positive patch test in our patients, but was at a level which could produce false positive reactions in subjects highly sensitive to nickel.\r"
