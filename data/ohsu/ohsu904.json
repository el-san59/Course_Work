I performed a retrospective analysis of the accuracy of physicians' calculations of the formulas for parenteral alimentation fluid. In addition, I assessed the ability of our institution's computer-based parenteral alimentation program to correct the deficiencies identified. The study showed no significant differences between physicians' calculations as a whole and their paired ideal values. Individual errors did occur, however, and were large enough to have potential clinical importance. Use of the parenteral alimentation program was found to correct these errors.\r"

Nerve cells typically express a number of K+ channels that differ in their kinetics, single-channel conductance, pharmacology, and sensitivity to voltage and second messengers. The cloning of the Shaker gene in Drosophila, and of related genes, has revealed that the encoded K+ channel polypeptides resemble one of the four internally homologous domains of the alpha-subunits of Na+ channels and Ca2+ channels, indicating that K+ channels may form by the co-assembly of several polypeptides. In this report we provide evidence that the Shaker A-type K+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes contain several Shaker polypeptides, that heteromultimeric channels may form through assembly of different channel polypeptides, that the kinetics or pharmacology of some heteromultimeric channels differ from those of homomultimeric channels, and that channel polypeptides from the fruit fly can co-assemble with homologous polypeptides from the rat. We suggest that heteromultimer formation may increase K+ channel diversity beyond even the level expected from the large number of K+ channel genes and alternative splicing products.\r"

  ".W": "Clonal deletion plays a major part in the maintenance of natural self-tolerance in both normal and transgenic mice. Self antigens that are expressed in the thymus result in the physical elimination of autoreactive thymocytes at a particular stage in their development. For example, the majority V beta 6- and V beta 8.1-bearing T cells that recognize the minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen, Mls-1a (ref. 10) , are clonally deleted in the thymuses of normal mice and transgenic mice expressing Mls-1a (refs 2, 3, 9). In contrast, a very different mechanism of tolerance involving the functional inactivation, but not elimination, of autoreactive cells, termed clonal inactivation or clonal anergy, has been implicated in some experimentally manipulated systems of tolerance. To test further the mechanisms involved in self-tolerance, we have generated transgenic mice expressing a V beta 8.1 beta chain on greater than 95% of peripheral T cells and have tested tolerance to Mls-1a in these mice. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the CD4+ peripheral cells that survived deletion were non-responsive in vitro to any stimulus tested. Naturally occurring tolerance to a self antigen expressed in the thymus can thus be mediated by clonal anergy, as well as by clonal deletion.\r"

The best evidence for this comes from studies on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have identified two small Ras-related GTP-binding proteins, Sec4p and Ypt1p, which control distinct stages of the secretory pathway. In mammalian cells the effects of a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GTP-gamma S, on different transport events have suggested that they also have proteins functionally related to yeast Sec4p and Ypt1p. The rab genes have recently been cloned and sequenced for rat and human and their proteins have highly conserved domains in common with Sec4p and Ypt1p (including a putative effector binding site). They are therefore good candidates for GTP-binding proteins involved in intracellular transport in mammalian cells. One of the Rab proteins (Rab1p) is the mammalian counterpart of Ypt1p (ref. 13). Here we report the localization of the protein Rab6p to the Golgi apparatus in several cell types. By immunolabelling and electron microscopy, Rab6p appears to be concentrated predominantly on the medial and trans cisternae and distributed over their entire surface.\r"

  ".W": "Animal cells can convert 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids into prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes. These locally produced mediators of inflammatory and immunological reactions act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Arachidonic acid (AA), the precursor of most PGs and leukotrienes, is present in the form of lipid esters within plasma lipoproteins and cannot be synthesised de novo by animal cells. Therefore, AA or its plant-derived precursor, linoleic acid, must be provided to cells if PGs or leukotrienes are to be formed. Because several classes of lipoproteins, including low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins, and chylomicron remnants, are taken up by means of the LDL receptor, and because LDL and very-low-density lipoproteins, but not high-density lipoproteins, stimulate PG synthesis, we have suggested previously that PG formation is directly linked to the LDL pathway. Using fibroblasts with the receptor-negative phenotype of familial hypercholesterolaemia and anti-LDL receptor antibodies, we show here that LDL deliver AA for PG production and that an LDL receptor-dependent feedback mechanism inhibits the activity of PGH synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of PG synthesis. These results indicate that the LDL pathway has a regulatory role in PG synthesis, in addition to its well-known role in the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid accumulation of sequence data has provided insight into the evolution of proteins and led to the identification of 'mosaic proteins'. These proteins have evolved by duplication, insertion and deletion of a common pool of structural units or modules, yet their biological functions are diverse. They are involved in cell adhesion and migration, embryogenesis and the pathways of blood clotting, fibrinolysis and complement. The modular units are defined by 'consensus sequences' which often include conserved disulphide bonds. Despite the available sequence information, little is known of the tertiary structure of mosaic proteins. If, however, the 'consensus structure' of the modules were known, valuable structural information could be inferred about a wide variety of proteins and biological systems. An important mosaic protein is fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that consists of three types of module (see refs 3, 7 for reviews). Here we describe the structure of the fibronectin type 1 module which appears twelve times in fibronectin and is also found in factor XII and tissue plasminogen activator. The module was produced using a yeast expression system and the structure was determined in solution using 1H NMR. This methodology promises to be extremely powerful in the investigation of modules from a wide range of mosaic proteins.\r"

To identify such carbohydrate epitopes, which may be suitable for immunization against schistosomiasis, we have previously generated monoclonal antibodies to surface antigens; some of these confer protection to naive mice when passively administered. Here we show that one of the protective antibodies recognizes a determinant present in both the parasite and its mammalian hosts. The immunohistochemical distribution of this determinant in the head of embryonic mice was found to be identical to the stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1), an epitope abundant in pre-implantation embryos, several adult tissues, and malignant tumors. Oligosaccharides containing the SSEA-1 trisaccharide Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc inhibit antibody binding to parasite antigen. SSEA-1 antibodies generated from mice immunized with rodent neural antigens bind to the surface of the schistosome larvae and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. SSEA-1 antibodies are also elicited during human schistosomiasis infection, and this autoantibody response may be involved in the development of the natural immunity against the parasite.\r"

Homozygous lines carrying additional copies of the Sod gene were recovered and characterized.

Toward understanding the mechanism of action of Krev-1 protein, we constructed a series of point mutants of Krev-1 cDNA and tested their biological activities in DT cells and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells harboring the activated N-ras gene. Substitutions of the amino acid residues in the putative guanine nucleotide-binding regions (Asp17 and Asn116), in the putative effector-binding domain (residue 38), at the putative acylation site (Cys181), and at the unique Thr61 all decreased the transformation suppressor activity. On the other hand, substitutions such as Gly12 to Val12 and Gln63 to Glu63 were found to significantly increase the transformation suppressor/tumor suppressor activity of Krev-1. These findings are consistent with the idea that Krev-1 protein is regulated like many other G proteins by the guanine triphosphate/guanine diphosphate-exchange mechanism probably in response to certain negative growth-regulatory signals.\r"

This repression can be alleviated when CREB is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Repression cannot be alleviated by a mutant CREB deficient in the protein kinase A phosphorylation site (M1 CREB Ser-133----Ala), suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB at this site is essential for the relief of repression. Repression by CREB requires its binding to the c-jun promoter. In NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing CREB, c-jun is no longer induced by serum, but this repression can be relieved by treatment of the cells with forskolin, an agonist of the adenylate cyclase pathway. Thus, CREB has a dual function, that of a repressor in the absence of phosphorylation and an activator when phosphorylated by protein kinase A.\r"

  ".W": "Conditions were devised to demonstrate GTP-regulated coupling between the yeast STE2-encoded receptor and its cognate guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). Treatment of partially purified membranes with guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]) converted the receptor from a high-affinity state (Kd = 17 nM) to a much lower affinity state (Kd approximately 150 nM), as judged by three independent criteria: rate of ligand (alpha-factor) dissociation, equilibrium binding, and antagonist competition. Expression of STE2 from the GAL1 promoter in MATa/MAT alpha diploids, which do not express GPA1 (encoding G protein alpha subunit, G alpha), STE4 (encoding G protein beta subunit, G beta), and STE18 (encoding G protein gamma subunit, G gamma) but do express another G protein alpha subunit (product of GPA2), yielded a single class of low-affinity receptors that were GTP[gamma-S]-insensitive, indicating that STE2 gene product cannot couple productively with other G proteins, even in the absence of competition by its cognate G protein. By using gpa1, STE4, and ste18 mutations, it was found that all three G protein subunits were required for functional coupling, as judged by the absence of high-affinity receptors when any of the three gene products was altered. This finding demonstrates that G beta and G gamma subunits are essential for formation of a productive complex between a G alpha subunit and its corresponding receptor. Wild-type STE4 and STE18 gene products were not essential for membrane localization of the GPA1 gene product, as indicated by cell fractionation and immunological analyses, suggesting that G beta and G gamma subunits interact with the receptor or make the G alpha subunit competent to associate correctly with the receptor, or both.\r"

The fact that the cloned cDNA fragments encoded a 377-amino acid polypeptide (41,626 Da) consisting of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide of 20 amino acids, a large (35,603 Da) subunit polypeptide, and a small (4144 Da) subunit polypeptide indicates that the two subunits are cotranslated as a precursor polypeptide. The amino acid sequence of mature subunits deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed 20-22% homology with human CA isozymes (CAI, CAII, and CAIII). Three zinc-liganded histidine residues and those forming a hydrogen-bond network to zinc-bound solvent molecules were highly conserved in the plant and animal enzymes. Three possible asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were found in the large subunit. Northern blot analysis was carried out using the cDNA fragment as a probe. The level of 2.0-kilobase CA mRNA increased within 1 hr when CO2 concentration of the bubbling gas was changed from 5% to 0.04% (air level) in the presence of light. On the other hand, CA mRNA did not accumulate when CO2 concentration was lowered in the dark. Experiments using 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea showed that photosynthesis is absolutely required for the accumulation of CA mRNA. These results indicate that CA biosynthesis is regulated by changes in environmental CO2 concentration as well as light at the level of mRNA abundance.\r"

Obesity and use of estrogen replacement therapy are protective. Factors that probably or possibly increase risk in postmenopausal white women include a low calcium intake, cigarette smoking, and, at least for hip fractures, use of long half-life psychotrophic drugs and heavy alcohol consumption. Factors probably or possibly associated with a decreased risk include ingestion of vitamin D and its metabolites, fluoride levels of 2 ppm or more in drinking water, moderate physical activity, pregnancies and breast feeding, use of thiazide diuretics, and progestogens. Some evidence suggests that calcium intake and physical activity at young ages may be important determinants of peak bone mass. Few studies have been undertaken in males and blacks, although at least some risk factors in males may be similar to those in females. Preventive efforts may be aimed at increasing peak bone mass at young ages, preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women, and preventing fractures and their adverse consequences in older people with osteoporosis.\r"

The diagnostic validity was evaluated from measurements on healthy premenopausal women, and three groups of postmenopausal osteoporotic women (prior forearm fracture (N = 45), prior spine fracture (N = 46), or prior hip fracture (N = 27]. The forearm measurement separated all three osteoporotic groups from the premenopausal women at least as well as the spine measurement. The value of follow-up procedures was estimated using data from a clinical trial on prevention of postmenopausal bone loss by sex hormones. Fewer participants are needed in clinical trials when a forearm scanner is used instead of a spine scanner, because of the better precision of the former. The forearm scanner seems to be the best tool of the three for bone mass measurements, in both clinical practice and for research purposes.\r"

Total bone is measured by the absorptiometry procedures, trabecular bone by quantitative computed tomography. Several commercial instruments are available for each technique. For clinical use, if decisions are being made based on measurements in a given patient, preferred measurement sites are the spine (for Type I osteoporosis) and hip (for Type II osteoporosis). The newly introduced dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) procedure allows measurements of the spine and hip with the highest precision and accuracy, the lowest radiation dose, and the shortest scanning time.\r"

Measurements made in the extremities generally do not allow prediction of vertebral fracture risk. Prediction of hip fracture risk is difficult because of the complex geometry of the femur. The few data which are available suggest that DPA may be useful to predict the risk of femoral neck fracture. If these data can be confirmed, cost-benefit analysis indicates that mass screening for osteoporosis may be a viable strategy. Physicians and patients using bone mass measurement techniques should be aware that these tests can be misleading, and that scrupulous attention to detail is required. Close supervision of the tests by a physician is necessary to ensure that meaningful data are obtained.\r"

Calcium is important during growth, and probably up to about age 35, when peak bone mass is finally achieved. Recent controversy concerning the role of calcium in the middle-aged and elderly, arising out of population studies showing sometimes only weak calcium effects, can be resolved by recognizing the multifactorial character of involutional bone loss, and by careful attention to such details as national differences in habitual calcium intakes. Thus interpreted, metabolic, epidemiologic, and intervention studies are internally consistent, and indicate that inadequate calcium intake also makes an important contribution to involutional bone loss.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis in the elderly woman is determined by the amount of peak bone mass in adolescence, the premenopausal maintenance of such peak bone mass, and the rate of postmenopausal bone mass loss. The majority of research efforts in the past have been directed at defining the pathogenesis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic bone loss. A comparatively new, and potentially fertile, area of research deals with factors responsible for attaining and augmenting peak bone mass in the adolescent female. Determinants of peak bone mass include genetic, nutritional, weight loading (exercise), and environmental factors. Nutritional factors, especially calcium, are potentially most amenable to therapeutic manipulation. Current data suggest that calcium deficiency exists in the adolescent female; and, although the current data are preliminary and not conclusive, they suggest that increasing calcium intake may be of value in increasing peak bone mass. However, assurance of compliance in the teenage female population in increasing calcium intake is difficult; relating a disease of the elderly, such as osteoporosis, to a teenage female population, a population that may experience the disease 40-50 years later, is frequently frustrating. Nevertheless, increased attention must be directed toward increasing calcium intake in this population of females. The amount of bone mass in adolescence may determine the amount of bone mass postmenopausally; a high or low peak bone mass may, therefore, contribute to protection against, or risk of, subsequent fracture. The ultimate target population for osteoporosis prophylaxis may indeed be the young, rather than the elderly, female.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence from a variety of sources indicates that exercise can increase the mineral content of bone, raising the expectation that exercise programs may be effective therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis, and the prevention of hip and spinal fractures. Indeed, prospective studies demonstrate that primarily weight-bearing exercise prevents the age-related decline in axial skeletal mass and, in some instances, increases bone mineral content. Optimal changes in the skeleton in response to exercise are seen in those women with adequate intake of dietary calcium. Neither hormonal status nor age appears to preclude the skeletal benefits of exercise. The design of an exercise program must consider the physical condition of the participants, their current levels of activity, their compliance, and the objectives of the program. Generic programs that are not designed for individuals' needs and limitations, and that are not adequately supervised, will result in a high rate of musculoskeletal complications and noncompliance. Unfortunately, additional studies are necessary before we can construct an optimum exercise prescription for bone health which addresses duration, frequency, intensity, and type of exercise. Of concern is the fact that gains in bone mass achieved with exercise are lost following their discontinuation in postmenopausal women, underscoring the concept that the level of physical activity is a major and dynamic determinant of skeletal integrity. Thus, it will be necessary to develop strategies to preserve the gains in skeletal mass achieved through exercise. Finally, before exercise can be promoted for bone health, it will be necessary to demonstrate that such programs can indeed prevent osteoporotic fractures.\r"

Although long-term use data are few, there is presently little evidence for an increase or decrease in breast cancer risk associated with estrogen by itself (unopposed estrogen), or estrogen plus progestin. In contrast, a large body of evidence suggests that unopposed estrogen significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease; there is no evidence that this benefit will persist when a progestin is added. The preferred method of estrogen replacement therapy, to prevent osteoporosis in a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus, should be chosen with these different risks and benefits in mind.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis is more readily prevented than treated, and early intervention with effective therapy would be expected to reduce significantly the impact of osteoporotic fractures among the aging population. For the postmenopausal female population, estrogen is the cornerstone of therapy, and multiple studies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing cortical and trabecular bone loss in the axial and peripheral skeleton. Alternative strategies for those who cannot, or will not, take estrogen and who can be documented to be at increased risk of osteoporosis, include calcium supplementation, progestogens, (particularly the 19-nortestosterone derivatives), calcitonin, diphosphonates, and anabolic steroids. All have been shown in some populations to reduce the rate of bone loss to a greater or lesser extent, although, overall, the data are as yet inconclusive. All regimes, with the exception of moderate calcium supplementation, have negative aspects to their use currently, and further research is required before a definitive alternative to estrogen for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis can be recommended. Only estrogens and calcitonin have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in the treatment of osteoporosis. In the decision-making process for the woman at mid-life, risk factor assessment, although a poor quantitative tool for the individual patient, is the starting point for the evaluation of patients. Bone mass measurements play a crucial role in assisting the dubious patient (or physician) about the need for therapy. Estrogen use, however, is a more important issue for the postmenopausal female, with sequelae other than its effects on bone to be considered, including effects on cardiovascular disease, endometrial and breast cancer, which must be considered in the equation of risk-benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Professionals and consumers alike agree that osteoporosis is a serious disease. Most think that the disease is preventable, although serious. Most women are aware that osteoporosis may begin years before symptoms become evident, and that they may be subject to the disease. Most consumers and professionals believe that the ideal time to begin osteoporosis prevention is adolescence. If prevention does not begin during that age, some physicians suggest that any steps toward prevention taken premenopausally are beneficial. Nearly all of those surveyed believe that calcium as well as exercise helps prevent osteoporosis. Although about 90 percent of the physicians surveyed agreed that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) alleviates osteoporosis; only 48 percent of postmenopausal women believe that ERT is helpful. The majority of the professionals who responded believe that most women do not get enough calcium in their diets, and that most women do not exercise enough. Although in most instances the consumers responding to this study were slightly less informed about the risks and factors associated with osteoporosis than were the professionals, the opinions of the four groups surveyed were similar for most of the topics discussed.\r"

Exposure of hamsters and rats to light pulses at those phases of the circadian rhythm during which light can shift the rhythm caused increased immunoreactivity for the product of the immediate-early gene c-fos in cells in the region of the SCN that receives retinal fibers. Light pulses also increased messenger RNA for the Fos protein and for the immediate-early protein NGFI-A in the rat SCN. Similar increases in mRNA for NGFI-A were seen in the SCN of hamsters. Thus cells in this portion of the SCN undergo alterations in gene expression in response to retinal illumination, but only at times in the circadian cycle when light is capable of influencing entrainment.\r"

Compared with those 4 hours after surgery, concentrations of all proteins decreased significantly in the left hemisphere 3 days after surgery (p less than 0.01). Microtubule-associated protein 2 was the most susceptible to ischemia, and its mean +/- SEM concentration decreased to 23 +/- 9.4% of that in concurrent sham-operated controls. Degradation products of microtubule-associated protein 2 and myelin-associated glycoprotein were detected on the blots. Furthermore, in the contralateral hemisphere (where calpain might be activated), concentrations of these two proteins decreased to 57 +/- 12.0% and 83 +/- 4.3% of those in concurrent sham-operated controls, respectively, 3 days after surgery.

Using this monitoring procedure it could be shown that CyA-associated nephrotoxicity in the early course after liver transplantation is associated with two distinct patterns of blood level derangement. One pattern is characterized by increased parent drug levels, the other by an increased metabolite concentration resulting from severely disturbed CyA metabolite excretion. This raises the possibility that not only the parent drug but also some of its metabolites may exert nephrotoxic effects when present in excessively high concentrations. This finding provided the rationale for a therapeutic CyA-monitoring regimen taking into account both specific and nonspecific measurements. In liver transplant patients monitored according to this regimen and treated with quadruple immunosuppression the incidence and severity of CyA-associated nephrotoxicity was markedly reduced. The metabolite-associated type of nephrotoxicity was only found in patients with severely disturbed liver function.\r"

Nitrate plasma half-life is longer and volume of distribution is larger in older persons. Apparently, these pharmacokinetic differences in older persons lead to increased venous smooth muscle responsivity to nitrates which, in turn, leads to greater reductions in central venous and pulmonary arterial pressures after nitrate administration. This is probably the explanation for the greater frequency of nitrate-induced severe hypotension and bradycardia in elderly patients with myocardial infarction compared with younger patients. Clinicians should be cognizant of the changes in the cardiovascular system which occur with age that sensitize the elderly patient to the action of organic nitrates. Initial dosages of nitrates should accordingly be less than in younger patients.\r"

The extent of nitrate tolerance at 24 hours was calculated as the percentage loss of the benefit achieved at time of peak effect of nitroglycerin. Tolerance had a different time course and magnitude in the venous, arterial and pulmonary circulations. At 24 hours, right atrial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance returned to control values in most patients, while 40 to 50% of the effect on systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure was maintained.

The patients received, in a random order, ISDN spray, 2.5 mg, or sublingual NTG, 0.8 mg. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after each drug. The second drug was given only after return of the hemodynamic parameters to baseline, plus a washout period of 2 hours. The hemodynamic variables measured were comparable at baseline. Both drugs produced hemodynamic improvement including a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Only ISDN spray significantly increased cardiac output. The onset of action of ISDN spray was significantly more rapid than that of NTG. This was primarily evident in the decrease in PCWP. With ISDN spray the decrease started at 1 minute after administration, and at 3 minutes a decrease of 8.6 mm Hg was already found. The corresponding value for sublingual NTG was 1.6 mm Hg. The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.02). The peak effect of ISDN spray on PCWP and right atrial pressure was greater than that of NTG. Thus, the onset of the hemodynamic effect of the new formulation of ISDN spray is much more rapid than that of sublingual NTG tablets. At the doses used, the magnitude of the effect of the ISDN spray on some of the hemodynamic variables is greater than that of sublingual NTG.\r"

Two 7-day washout periods were performed at entry and at the end of the study. Efficacy was evaluated by clinical assessment of anginal attacks and NTG consumption and by means of multistage treadmill exercise testing. Exercise tests were performed at time 0 (24 hours from application of last patch), at 4 and 12 hours after dosing at the end of first 7-day washout, at the end of the first month of treatment, at the end of the second month of treatment after crossover, at the end of 3 months of treatment with active patch and at the end of the second 7-day washout period. Statistics were obtained by multivariate analysis of difference. In 27 patients whose records were available for final analysis the daily attacks of angina and NTG consumption decreased significantly during both the subchronic and chronic phases of the trial compared with placebo (p less than 0.001). Subchronic study showed significant improvement of maximal exercise duration, time to onset of angina, time to ST-segment depression of 1.0 mm, time to regression of angina and time to regression of ST depression, compared with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From multiple-regression analysis, the best-fitting equation for calculating REE (REE = 54.4 LBM (kg) + 0.095 creatinine (mmol/kg) + 4.7) was highly significant (r = 0.987, p less than 0.0001). Although the regressions of REE on weight were significantly different between the two groups, the equations using LBM or 24-h urinary creatinine did not discriminate between them. These findings suggest that an equation based on LBM or 24-h urinary creatinine excretion could be a more accurate estimate of REE than are conventional methods based on weight or height, and it may be applicable to diverse nutritional states.\r"

  ".W": "Acid maltase, or acid alpha glucosidase (GAA), is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen to glucose and is deficient in glycogen storage disease type II. We have previously isolated a partial cDNA (1.9 kb) for human GAA and detected abnormalities of mRNA in two infantile-onset and one adult-onset patient. We have now extended this study and examined mRNA and DNA from cell lines of eight additional infantile and three adult-onset patients. While five of the 10 infantile-onset patients expressed normal amounts and sizes of mRNA, the remaining five did not express detectable GAA mRNA. Two adult-onset patients had normal amounts and sizes of mRNA, while two adult-onset patients had mRNA of smaller size. Thus, half of the larger series of GAA-deficient patients also exhibited quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities of mRNA. Of the five infantile-onset patients with normal mRNA, two exhibited an abnormal SacI fragment not found in DNA from 60 normals. To further characterize these patients, we determined GAA activity in several of the cell lines by using either the artificial substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucoside, or the natural substrate glycogen. Two adult-onset patients who both had normal size mRNA differed as to enzyme activity, with one patient exhibiting enzyme activity similar to that in infantile-onset patients. By combining these data with those for previously reported presence or absence of GAA-mutant protein cross-reacting to antibody, we provide evidence for a minimum of six different mutations in these 14 GAA-deficient cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) derive, in part, from normal neuronal cytoskeletal proteins, ie, large portions of tau (tau) but only restricted segments of the peripheral domains of the high- and middle-molecular weight neurofilament subunits. To learn more about the events leading to the incorporation of tau and neurofilament epitopes into NFTs, the relative abundance of tau and NF determinants in these lesions was quantitatively analyzed in hippocampi from Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and age-matched controls using monoclonal antibodies specific for tau or for NF proteins. Immunostained NFTs appeared qualitatively the same in both AD and controls, ie, every epitope found in AD NFTs occurred also in the NFTs of the control patients. However, in hippocampi with only a few tangles, tau epitopes, but no NF epitopes, were detected in NFTs. In contrast, both tau and NF epitopes were present in those tangles that were found in hippocampi with abundant NFTs. Nevertheless, the number of tau-positive NFTs generally exceeded the number of NF-positive NFTs. These findings indicate that tau epitopes are more abundant than NF epitopes in NFTs and that the formation of NFTs may be linked to a derangement in the normal metabolism of tau that is more extensive than alterations in NF protein metabolism.\r"

In the present report we describe a fourth patient with EBV-related T-cell lymphoma. The patient presented with an angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-like T-cell lymphoma. Serology was compatible with chronic Epstein-Barr (EBV) infection. After a 1-year period of waxing and waning lymphadenopathy, this lymphoma evolved to an aggressive CD8+ Immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. A relationship with the chronic EBV infection was indicated by the finding of EBV genome in the tumor tissue by Southern blot analysis. Moreover, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected in situ within individually defined CD8+ tumor cells by two-color immunofluorescence. Two alternative possibilities, namely that EBV primarily played a role in lymphomagenesis of the AILD-like T-cell lymphoma or that the virus was an additional oncogenic event in the final process of tumor progression to the immunoblastic lymphoma, are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Bartonellosis, a biphasic disease caused by motile intracellular bacteria, produces in its tissue phase a characteristic dermal eruption (Verruga peruana) resulting from a pronounced endothelial cell proliferation. Bacteria are found in the interstitium and within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells (Rocha-Lima inclusion). The aim of this study was to determine if Bartonella bacilliformis produce a substance(s) that might be responsible for the vascular proliferation seen in the Verruga. This was assessed in an in vitro system using human endothelial cells and measuring proliferation as well as production of tissue type plasminogen activator after exposure to the endothelial cultures to B. bacilliformis extracts. Our results indicate that B. bacilliformis possess an activity that stimulates endothelial cell proliferation up to three times that of control. The factor(s) is specific for endothelial cells, heat sensitive, larger than 12 to 14 kd, not enhanced by heparin, has no affinity for heparin, and is precipitated by 45% ammonium sulfate. In addition, the B. bacilliformis extracts stimulate production of t-PA antigen in a concentration-dependent fashion. This activity is also heat sensitive and not lost after dialysis (12 to 14 kd). B. bacilliformis extracts, however, do not increase the production of plasminogen activator inhibitor. It was also determined that B. bacilliformis extracts stimulate the formation of new blood vessels in an in vivo model for angiogenesis. These results describe a bacterial factor(s) that stimulates two important steps in the development of new blood vessels in vitro, as well as the formation of new blood vessels in vivo. Determining the mechanism of action, combined with a complete characterization of this factor(s), may help in understanding the pathogenesis not only of the Verruga and angiogenesis in general but also the recently described Cat-Scratch-associated epithelioid hemangiomas in patients with AIDS and Kaposi sarcoma.\r"

In a supplementary study and using a similar immunogold technique, the authors identified amyloid A in deparaffinized renal tissue from three of the 11 cases of renal amyloidosis. Each patient had similar clinical manifestations (chronic renal failure with proteinuria) and similar glomerular morphology (thickened glomerular basement membranes and nodular expansion of the mesangium). In 12 cases (10 amyloid, 2 kappa LC), immunoelectron microscopy localized LC antigens over the glomerular deposits and allowed indirect tissue quantitation of each LC antigen to the various cellular and interstitial compartments. In 6 of the 11 cases of renal amyloidosis, the amyloid labeled only for lambda, and in one, only for kappa. In one patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who had a biclonal gammopathy, both LC were identified in the amyloid. In two cases, both of whom had a history of chronic suppurative lung disease, both LC antigens as well as amyloid A were localized to the amyloid fibrils. In only one case, in which glomerular amyloid labeled for amyloid A, the amyloid did not label for either LC. Whereas lambda LC-derived fibrils often appeared as spicules in the glomerular subepithelial space, other amyloid deposits usually accumulated in the subendothelial zone and did not form spicules. The epimembranous location of spicules suggested that the amyloid precursor protein transformed into amyloid fibrils after filtration into the urinary space. Presence of epimembranous spicules may explain the more severe proteinuric renal failure and the more rapid progression to glomerulosclerosis described in primary amyloidosis.\r"

  ".W": "During an 11-year period, 41 patients with Crohn's disease were placed on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for a mean of 1,083 days (range: 33 to 3,258 days). Data were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether HPN had an effect on the course of their disease, i.e., on the number of operative procedures performed and the intensity of required medical therapy. Data represented information obtained during a total of 121 patient-years of HPN for Crohn's disease. The main indications for HPN were short bowel syndrome (66%) and high stoma output. Twenty-four of 41 patients (59%) underwent surgery for Crohn's disease during the course of HPN. There was no significant difference between the number of procedures performed per patient per year of Crohn's disease during pre-HPN and HPN periods (p greater than 0.25). Although there was no significant change in body weight, both serum albumin and transferrin levels increased during HPN (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Twenty-nine percent of patients were taking prednisone while on HPN, compared with 54% of patients during the pre-HPN period (p less than 0.01). HPN appeared to result in a significant improvement in the numerically assessed quality of life. During the HPN period, 24 patients had 1 or more HPN-related complications that required 1 to 13 hospital admissions (mean: 1.8). These complications included catheter sepsis in 19 patients, blocked or damaged catheters in 15 patients, and dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalance in 5 patients. Eight patients died, with 7% of deaths secondary to catheter-related sepsis. Although permanent HPN is associated with an identifiable morbidity and mortality and is not associated with a reduction in the frequency of surgery for Crohn's disease, benefits include a decrease in the intensity of medical therapy, an improvement in patients' nutritional state, and a significant perceived improvement in patients' quality of life. Without HPN, we believe all patients would have died secondary to malnutrition and/or dehydration.\r"

A sizable number of these patients present with localized or regional disease. Regional high-dose chemotherapy, such as with isolated perfusion, may offer an alternative therapy with low treatment-related morbidity and mortality and better end results in this group of patients. In an effort to develop such a treatment modality, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of mitomycin C (MMC) during isolated perfusion of pancreas in a canine model. From this study, it appears that a dose of 0.25 mg MMC/kg body weight is most suitable for isolated perfusion of pancreas at 39 degrees C, maintaining flow rate and pressure within physiologic range. Isolated perfusion with a dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight has very mild short- and long-term toxicities and markedly increases drug delivery to the pancreas, duodenum, and peripancreatic lymph nodes, making it the most suitable dose for possible clinical application.\r"

Many of these issues comprise the medicolegal elements of informed consent for elective blood transfusion, so that increasingly the need for a dialogue incorporating these issues between the transfusing physician and the potential transfusion recipient is recognized. If the process is to be effective, then early involvement of the patient in a dialogue concerning informed consent is necessary. An overview of the medical elements and content of informed consent for elective blood transfusion is presented.\r"

  ".W": "Using positron emission tomography, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured after the addition of isoflurane (1.3 vols %, end-tidal concentration) to neuroleptanesthesia (fentanyl/droperidol) in hypocapnic baboons. The study was designed to determine whether isoflurane, when administered during hypocapnia, acted as a cerebral vasodilator to increase either CBF or CBV. Mean arterial pressure was maintained within 10% of preisoflurane levels with an angiotensin infusion. In the first protocol (A), CBF and CBV were measured as close together in time as possible in order to detect divergent effects of isoflurane on these variables. When PaCO2 was reduced from 40 mmHg to 25 mmHg, CBF decreased from 44 +/- 4 to 31 +/- 4 ml.100 g-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05) and CBV decreased from 3.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g (P less than .05). Neither CBF nor CBV was significantly changed by the addition of isoflurane. In the second protocol (B), serial CBV scans were performed frequently during the addition of isoflurane in a fashion designed to detect transient changes in CBV at the time isoflurane was first added to the breathing circuit. Induction of hypocapnia again reduced CBV from 3.1 +/- .3 to 2.7 +/- .2 ml/100 g, (P less than .05) and addition of isoflurane did not change CBV. From these results the authors conclude that in the normal hypocapnic baboon the addition of 1.3% isoflurane does not significantly change cerebral blood flow or volume.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the mechanism of action of anesthetics at the biochemical level. The present work, however, gives evidence that barbiturates inhibit inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in both intact and permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells by an effect on GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Inhibition of hydrolysis was observed when intact cells were stimulated with antigen (DNP24 BSA) or with oligomers of IgE. The inhibition was dependent on the concentration and type of barbiturate used with an order of inhibitory action of secobarbital less than S(-) pentobarbital less than pentobarbital less than R(+) pentobarbital less than phenobarbital. The relatively inactive analogue, (1'RS, 3'SR) 3-hydroxypentobarbital caused little (less than 30% at 1 mM) or no inhibition (at 0.1-0.5 mM). In permeabilized cells, the hydrolysis induced by DNP24 BSA and the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTP gamma S (2-100 microM), was also inhibited by pentobarbital. The inhibition of hydrolysis was decreased as pH increased, and was no longer apparent at pH 7.8, a possible indication that the inhibitory effect was due to the unionized form of the drug. In permeabilized cells, the inhibition by pentobarbital occurred in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and was uncompetitive in nature (Km = 7.1 microM for GTP in controls vs. 1.6 microM in the presence of 0.5 mM pentobarbital). Taken together, the data suggest that barbiturates alter the activity of G-proteins independently of Ca2+, and the inhibition may depend on both the hydrophobic properties and the stereospecific and structural features of the molecule.\r"

Dose-response curves to MBS were steep and were reproducible, within a 7-day period, to within one doubling dose, with mean PD20FEV1 values of 2.17 and 2.11 mumol in 11 subjects. There was no correlation between PD20FEV1 values to MBS and histamine, and inhalation of MBS did not enhance responses to subsequent challenge with histamine (mean PD20FEV1 to histamine was 0.65 mumol and to histamine 1 h after MBS was 0.74 mumol). Challenge with MBS (mean PD20FEV1 4.07 mumol) did not cause refractoriness to a second challenge 1 h later (mean PD20FEV1 5.39 mumol). Of 20 subjects tested, prior inhalation of 8 mg nedocromil sodium blocked the response to MBS in 15 subjects and reduced it in two others. Cromolyn sodium (4 mg) blocked the response to MBS in three subjects but did not alter the mean PD20FEV1 in the remaining 17 subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To increase understanding of how it causes bronchoconstriction, the characteristics of airway response in 28 asthmatic subjects were documented. Subjects inhaled histamine, in doses ranging from 0.03 to 7.8 mumol, or benzalkonium in doses ranging from 0.04 to 5.33 mumol on separate days. The dose of histamine or benzalkonium that caused a 20% fall in the 1-s forced expiratory volume (PD20FEV1) was measured. All subjects responded to histamine, with PD20FEV1 values in the range of 0.14 to 7.8 mumol and 17 responded to benzalkonium, with PD20FEV1 values in the range 0.35 to 5.55 mumol. Subjects who responded to benzalkonium were more sensitive to histamine (mean PD20FEV1 0.44 mumol) than subjects who did not respond (mean PD20FEV1 1.84 mumol) and, among the benzalkonium responders, there was a significant correlation between PD20FEV1 values for histamine and benzalkonium (r = 0.5, p less than 0.05). Inhalation of benzalkonium enhanced subsequent responses to histamine, causing a decrease in mean PD20FEV1 from 0.51 to 0.18 mumol histamine (p less than 0.001), but did not alter subsequent responses to benzalkonium. The response to benzalkonium reached a maximum 1 min after inhalation and was slow to recover, taking up to 60 min to return to baseline values. Response to benzalkonium was inhibited by 8 mg cromolyn sodium but not by 160 micrograms ipratropium bromide. The characteristics of the response to benzalkonium suggest a mechanism of action via release of mediators.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that blood flow, by its effect on blood volume, influences airflow resistance in peripheral airways. In conscious ewes, forced sinusoidal flow oscillations (5 Hz) were applied through a balloon-tipped, dual-channel fiberoptic bronchoscope placed in a segmental bronchus, and peripheral airflow resistance (Rp) was determined from flow and bronchial pressure. Drugs with predominant vascular or airway smooth muscle effects were administered locally through the bronchoscope. Nitroglycerin (NTG) produced a dose-dependent increase in mean Rp (+288% at 1,000 micrograms), which was blocked by methylene blue (p less than 0.05) and not reversed by atropine. Carbachol (CARB) also increased mean Rp in a dose-dependent manner (+605% at 400 micrograms); this effect was not blocked by methylene blue, but it was reversed by atropine (p less than 0.05). The increase in mean Rp after a single dose of NTG (250 micrograms) was sustained for at least 20 min and transiently reversed by vasopressin (0.2 units, p less than 0.05) but not by isoproterenol (100 micrograms). Conversely, the sustained increase in Rp after a single dose of CARB (50 micrograms) was transiently reversed by isoproterenol (p less than 0.05) but not by vasopressin. We conclude that NTG increased Rp by vasodilation and CARB by bronchoconstriction. This supports the hypothesis that vasodilation limits airflow in the lung periphery, presumably because of vascular congestion.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that elevated osmolality of nasal secretions is linked to the rhinitic reaction to cold and dry air (CDA) that results in inflammatory mediator release and that nasal challenge with hyperosmolal solutions can induce histamine release in randomly selected individuals. These findings led to a comparison of the effect of nasal challenge with hypertonic fluid in 11 subjects who demonstrated a nasal response to CDA compared to 10 subjects without CDA sensitivity. All volunteers were challenged with isosmolal (300 mosmol/kg H2O) and hyperosmolal (800 mosmol/kg H2O) mannitol solutions. Their response was evaluated by symptom scores and quantification of histamine in nasal lavages. CDA responders differed significantly from non-responders in terms of both the total amount and the concentration of histamine in the lavage following hyperosmolal challenge (p less than 0.04 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, CDA responders reported a higher change from baseline for nasal congestion, pruritus, and lacrimation following hyperosmolal challenge, but the scores for rhinorrhea, the volume of the returned nasal lavage fluid following hyperosmolal challenge, and the capacity to reduce the osmolality of the administered hyperosmolal fluid did not differ. Allergic status was not a factor in hyperosmolal reactivity. To investigate possible differences in nonspecific nasal mucosal sensitivity that could account for these findings, all subjects underwent provocation with five increasing doses of histamine, from 0.01 to 1 mg. No significant difference between CDA responders and nonresponders in symptomatology or in the induction of vascular permeability, as assessed by TAME-esterase activity in nasal fluids, could be demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because indomethacin has been reported to increase allergic-stimulated 5-lipoxygenase product formation and to inhibit the late asthmatic response, we determined the effect of indomethacin (50 mg 3 times a day) or placebo on airway and biochemical responses to inhaled allergen in a randomized, blinded study. Urinary levels of the enzymatic metabolite of TXB2, 11-dehydro-TXB2, increased from 585 +/- 330 to 1,500 +/- 250 pg/mg creatinine (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) 2 h after allergen. Urinary LTE4 increased from 190 +/- 37 to 1,100 +/- 400 (p less than 0.05) 2 h after challenge. The urinary levels of these eicosanoids were not elevated during the late response. Indomethacin significantly reduced urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 levels without affecting the excretion of LTE4 or pulmonary function. Thus, we failed to obtain evidence for enhanced leukotriene formation during allergic stimulation in vivo in the presence of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Furthermore, we conclude that cyclooxygenase products are likely to play only a marginal role in allergic bronchoconstriction.\r"

Ethambutol showed bactericidal action with 10 micrograms/ml concentration when in constant contact with M. tuberculosis. At a lower concentration, bactericidal action was evident up to 6 days; after that time, this effect was lost owing to the development of drug-resistant mutants. The bactericidal action of ethambutol in this model was similar to that of rifampin and isoniazid. Pulsed exposure for 96 h caused a four-log reduction in cfu counts, but the growth resumed rapidly. The bactericidal action of ethambutol was maximal at 37 degrees C and less at low temperatures. Ethambutol showed little activity against cultures growing at 8 degrees C continuously that were incubated for only 1 h at 37 degrees C. Against cultures growing at 8 degrees C that were brought to 37 degrees C for 6 h, its action was similar to that of rifampin. Ethambutol combined with other drugs showed bactericidal action, although the activity was less than that of the combination isoniazid-streptomycin.\r"

Of the 263 patients whose sera were examined, 29 (11%) had H or B; 41 (17.5%) of the remaining 234 patients had false-positive test results. Of these 41 patients, 31 were positive for H alone, and 10 had antibodies to both H and B. All three patients with false-positive ID tests for histoplasmosis also had positive titers (greater than or equal to 1:16) on RIA. No patient had a false-positive ID result for blastomycosis. The percentage of patients in each of five major diagnostic categories with and without false-positive serologic tests was similar (p greater than 0.05). The majority of patients had pulmonary infections, almost half of which were granulomatous infections other than H or B; this reflects the clinical indications for requesting fungal serologic tests. A positive fungal serology is not useful in suggesting the presence of a pulmonary disease other than H or B in patients from an endemic area suspected of having a pulmonary mycosis.\r"

DESIGN: Hepatitis B virus markers, the antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), the antibody to HIV (anti-HIV), and aminotransferases were measured on serum samples collected before the first concentrate infusion and at regular time intervals thereafter. SETTING: Seventeen hemophilia centers in Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Austria, and the Democratic Republic of Germany. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine patients with hemophilia A who had not received a previous transfusion with blood products and who had normal alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) were included in the final analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No patient became positive for anti-HCV or anti-HIV or developed sustained increases in aminotransferase levels. Similarly, none of the 15 unvaccinated patients developed markers of HBV infection. CONCLUSION: This prospective study conducted in previously untransfused hemophiliacs highly susceptible to developing post-transfusion hepatitis shows that a large-pool clotting factor concentrate treated with pasteurization carries a low risk for transmitting HCV, the major causative agent of post-transfusion hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The neurofibromatoses comprise at least two autosomal dominant disorders affecting an estimated 100,000 Americans with clinical manifestations that may require care from every type of clinician. Neurofibromatosis 1 and neurofibromatosis 2 have in common the occurrence of many neurofibromas but are distinctly different clinical disorders. The disease genes are on different chromosomes. Magnetic resonance imaging, particularly with gadolinium enhancement, has generally supplanted other techniques for visualizing brain, spinal, and other neural tumors in both disorders. The technique has rekindled the controversy over the nature and frequency of optic pathway tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 and has revealed, throughout the brains of young patients, bright lesions that have uncertain clinical consequences and unknown pathologic bases. In patients with neurofibromatosis 2, small acoustic neuromas can be seen, leading to the possibility of excision with preservation of hearing and facial nerve function. Abnormal hearing may occur to excess in patients with neurofibromatosis 1, but acoustic neuroma has never been documented. In patients with neurofibromatosis 2, a battery of audiologic tests has a high positive predictive power. Lisch nodules or iris hamartomas, probably a universal sign in adults with the neurofibromatosis 1 gene, cause no problem with vision. Posterior capsular lens opacity in patients with neurofibromatosis 2 is a helpful diagnostic sign and a potential source of additional handicap in persons at risk for impaired hearing. Progress in the clinical delineation of the disorders has been matched with considerable research into the still obscure pathogenesis of the disorders. Such rapid advances may necessitate reconsideration of the conclusions of the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Neurofibromatosis, especially those on the categories of persons in which a neurofibromatosis should be considered and the need for caution in recommending surgery. Watchful waiting may often be the best management for acoustic neuromas in neurofibromatosis 2.\r"

Drugs were administered via the subclavicular artery. The dose range of each drug was determined so as not to affect the systemic blood pressure. The AA (20 to 70 micrograms) increased the inner ear blood flow dose-dependently; this effect was abolished by indomethacin (5 mg orally). Both prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 1 to 50 ng) and CS-570, a PGI2 analogue (12.8 to 25.6 ng) caused a dose-dependent increase in the inner ear blood flow. The response of PGI2 was shorter than that of PGE2. On the other hand, a stable thromboxane A2 (STA2; 30 to 80 ng) decreased the inner ear blood flow dose-dependently. Administration of PGF2 alpha (0.2 to 3 micrograms) showed no effect on the inner ear blood flow. These results indicated that the effect of AA was mediated mainly via PGI2 and PGE2.\r"

Fluvoxamine was significantly better than desipramine in reducing the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and by the global response rate (\"responder\" equaling \"much improved\"). Eleven of 21 patients were responders with fluvoxamine compared with 2 of 19 patients with desipramine. Fluvoxamine, but not desipramine, was also effective in reducing the severity of \"secondary\" depression. Fluvoxamine-induced improvement in symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder was not correlated with the severity of baseline depressive symptoms. This study provides additional evidence that the acute serotonin reuptake properties of a drug are predictive of its anti-obsessive-compulsive efficacy. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of action of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder may be related to chronic treatment-induced adaptive changes in presynaptic serotonin receptor function (eg, autoreceptor desensitization) and/or indirect influences on dopaminergic function (eg, in the basal ganglia).\r"

  ".W": "New approaches to antimicrobial therapy for ocular pathogens must overcome organisms that are resistant to current therapeutic modalities. This investigation examined the antimicrobial activity of novel antimicrobial neutrophil peptides (defensins NP-1 and NP-5) against isolates from clinical ocular microbial infections in humans and horses. The test panel of human clinical isolates included Candida albicans, an alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Morganella morganii. The test panel of equine pathogens included three clinical isolates of P aeruginosa and two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. The equine isolates were chosen for their relative resistance to commonly employed antimicrobial therapy. The two defensins differed markedly in their bactericidal activity. Defensin NP-5, at a 50-micrograms/mL concentration, exhibited minimal bactericidal activity against the majority of isolates of the test panel. The inferior microbicidal activity of NP-5 is consistent with previously published results. However, at this concentration, NP-5 did exhibit appreciable bacteriostatic activity against human ocular pathogens M morganii (74%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (57%), and P aeruginosa (93%) during the 2-hour incubation period. In contrast, defensin NP-1 at 10 micrograms/mL exerted potent microbicidal activity against all isolates, effecting a 2 to 3 log10 decrease in colony-forming units within a 60-minute incubation period. Under the assay conditions employed, these findings demonstrate: (1) two distinct mechanisms by which defensins exert their antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens associated with clinical ocular disease in humans and horses, and (2) that rabbit defensin NP-1 is a potent antimicrobial agent against a wide array of ocular pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether predictors of AIDS progression are operative very early in the natural history of HIV infection, we conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of 119 subjects who seroconverted while under observation in a prospective study of homosexual men. For each of the 18 cases who have progressed to AIDS, we randomly selected three controls who had seroconverted within 3 months of the case but who have remained AIDS-free. Cases and controls were compared with regard to laboratory and clinical parameters obtained at the time of the earliest HIV-positive result. The median duration between the estimated date of seroconversion and this first positive result was 4 months for cases and 6 months for controls. Cases exhibited lower CD4 counts (657 versus 774 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.037), lower CD4: CD8 ratios (0.98 versus 1.39; P = 0.003), higher immune complex levels (C1q binding: 25 versus 15%; P = 0.002), lower hemaglobin concentrations (14.8 versus 15.2 g/l; P = 0.011), higher immunoglobulin (Ig) A levels (272 versus 184 mg/dl; P = 0.003), and higher IgG levels (1530 versus 1300 mg/dl; P = 0.037) than controls. Cases exhibited higher CD8 counts of marginal statistical significance (732 versus 597 x 10(6)/l; P = 0.059). No differences were observed with respect to IgM levels, total lymphocyte or white blood cell counts, or the frequency of generalized lymphadenopathy. A total of 27.8% of cases but only 11.5% of controls reported one or more symptoms during the 6-month period preceding the first positive visit (P = 0.027). We conclude that laboratory and clinical abnormalities which are predictive of more rapid progression to AIDS may appear very early in HIV infection. This suggests that some of the factors responsible for more rapid disease progression are present in the host prior to or shortly after infection occurs.\r"

To address this issue, four juvenile rhesus macaques were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus SIVMAC. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these SIVMAC-infected macaques and four uninfected control macaques were assessed for T-cell proliferative activity to SIV, monthly, for 10 consecutive months. T cells from SIV-infected monkeys failed to proliferate in response to SIV added directly to the culture. However, when SIV was processed by autologous antigen-presenting cells prior to culture with purified T cells, proliferative responses were uniformly demonstrated in SIV-infected monkeys, but not in uninfected controls. Proliferation in response to heat-inactivated SIV was mediated by CD4+ T cells and was shown to be MHC class II-restricted. However, the proliferative response to infectious SIV was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and was MHC class-restricted. As disease progressed, a decline in the T-cell proliferative response was observed.\r"

  ".U": "90274894\r", 
  ".W": "Beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M), a marker that is increased in serum during immune activation, was investigated during the course of HIV infection. beta 2-M rose promptly in the first phase of HIV infection in people who were participating in a longitudinal study where serum samples and lymphocyte subset data were obtained at 6-monthly intervals. A rise in beta 2-M level in the first seropositive sample was seen in 93% of 50 HIV seroconverters, and those with high (or low) levels of beta 2-M at the end of year 1 tend to remain high (or low) in the ensuing years. Eighty-three per cent of seroconverters experienced a fall in CD4 T cells in the first year. The magnitude of the CD4 T-cell decline, however, did not correlate with the rise in beta 2-M in specific individuals in the first year. Nevertheless, 2-3 years after seroconversion, the initially increased beta 2-M levels did correlate inversely with the (reduced) level of CD4 T cells (P less than 0.001). Thus, the pattern of disease reflected by beta 2-M level is established in the first year of infection and persists through the following 2 years. beta 2-M levels were found to correlate with rate of CD4 T-cell fall in individuals with established HIV infection. Three groups of HIV-seropositive people with similar CD4 T-cell numbers at the first measurements (about 600-800 x 10(6)/l) but different rates of CD4 T-cell fall over the following 2 years were evaluated by beta 2-M levels. The group with stable CD4 T-cell numbers showed a significantly lower level of beta 2-M than the groups with moderately or rapidly declining CD4 T-cell numbers. Increases in beta 2-M levels during the 2 years of observation were found in people exhibiting a rapid decline in CD4 T cells (about 200 cells/year). The level of beta 2-M appears to be an indicator of HIV activity and of the rate of CD4 T-cell fall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Viral isolates were recovered by cocultivation on macrophage colony-stimulatingfactor (MCSF)-treated monocyte target cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 25 out of 27 patients seropositive or at risk for HIV infection. Frequency of virus recovery was independent of the patient's age, sex, numbers of CD4+ T cells, clinical stage or zidovudine (azidothymidine) therapy. Sixteen out of 19 HIV isolates were serially passaged in MCSF- treated monocytes. Five out of five virus isolates were also passaged in phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 (PHA/IL-2)-treated lymphoblasts. In lymphoblasts, no qualitative or quantitative differences were observed between these isolates and human T-cell leukemia virus IIIB (HTLV-IIIB) for (1) release of p24 antigen reverse transcriptase, and infectious virus, (2) induction of typical cytopathic effects (cell syncytia in 3-10% of cells) and cell lysis, (3) frequency of infected cells (5-20% of PBMC) as detected by in situ hybridization for HIV RNA, (4) down-modulation of T cell plasma membrane CD4, and (5) site of progeny virion assembly and budding (plasma membrane only with no intracytoplasmic accumulation of virus). Progeny virus recovered from infected lymphoblasts was fully infectious for other lymphoblasts, but failed to infect MCSF-treated monocytes. Detailed analysis of target cell tropism among HIV isolates showed that HIV isolated in monocytes infected both monocytes and lymphoblasts; progeny virus isolated in lymphoblasts infected only T cells. HIV interacts differently with monocytes and T cells. Understanding this interaction may more clearly define both the pathogenesis of HIV disease and strategies for therapeutic intervention.\r"

To follow the hypothesis of an association of ANP with the immune system, we now report that the rat thymus, a primary lymphoid organ, is a site of ANP synthesis. This is based on the following experimental evidence: firstly, the material detected corresponds chromatographically with the precursor of ANP. Secondly, the existence of mRNA for ANP in the gland suggests synthesis of the peptide in the gland. Thirdly, immunohistochemical studies locate ANP-like material in cortical thymocytes, predominantly in the subcapsular areas of the thymus. Both ANP-like material and mRNA were present to a larger extent in very young rats. The results communicated here support the notion of a link of ANP with the immune system.\r"

  ".W": "Because human P40 T-cell growth factor, tentatively designated interleukin-9 (IL-9), was isolated through its ability to stimulate a human IL-3-dependent leukemic cell line (M-O7E), we tested the ability of IL-9 to support the growth and differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow. Although the M-O7E cell line was derived from a patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia, IL-9 has not proved to be a growth or maturation factor for megakaryocytes, but instead has proved to be effective in supporting the development of erythroid bursts (BFU-E) in cultures supplemented with erythropoietin. Using highly purified progenitors from peripheral blood, IL-3 showed a BFU-E plating efficiency of 46% compared with 20% for IL-9. Because of the purity of these cell preparations and the low cell density in culture, IL-9 is likely to interact directly with erythroid progenitors. Analysis of mixing experiments and of the morphology of the BFU-E in culture indicated that IL-9 interacts preferentially with a relatively early population of IL-3-responsive BFU-E. In cultures of human bone marrow or cord blood, IL-9 selectively supported erythroid colony formation, while IL-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor additionally yielded granulocyte/macrophage colonies. Therefore, IL-9 represents a new T cell-derived cytokine with the potential for selectively stimulating erythroid development in the hematopoietic system.\r"

Its most completely described function is as a fibrinogen receptor that mediates platelet aggregation, but it is also involved in clot retraction, signal transduction, calcium transport, and other events. However, the mechanisms that regulate the functions of GP IIb-IIIa during platelet activation are largely unknown. One possible mechanism is phosphorylation, since several other receptors are regulated by this process. We found that GP IIIa, but not GP IIb, was phosphorylated in 32P-labeled platelets, predominantly on threonine residues. Furthermore, GP IIIa phosphorylation increased four-fold in platelets activated with thrombin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not at all in platelets treated with prostacyclin, an inhibitor of platelet activation. The thrombin-induced increase in phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreating platelets with prostacyclin or with staurosporin, a specific protein kinase C inhibitor. Thus, there is an increase in the level or turnover of phosphate on GP IIIa during platelet activation, most likely involving protein kinase C. This phosphorylation may regulate some aspect(s) of GP IIb-IIIa function.\r"

  ".W": "C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) is the major protease inhibitor of the first components of the classic complement system and of the proteases of the Hageman factor pathways. Since C1 INH may modulate inflammatory reactions associated with complement and contact system activation, we sought to determine if the cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) could modulate C1 INH production. Initial studies investigated the effect of IFN-gamma on the molecular and protein expression of C1 INH in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. HEL cells constitutively expressed the 2.1 kb mRNA for C1 INH. IFN-gamma (50 to 1,000 U/mL), but not interferon alpha or beta, increased twofold the amount of C1 INH mRNA expressed within HEL cells. Similarly, this cytokine increased HEL cell C1 INH synthesis of a 105 Kd protein 10-fold, from 1.9 +/- 0.5 microgram C1 INH antigen per 10(8) cells (mean +/- SEM) to 19 +/- 8 micrograms/10(8) cells in 8 days. C1 INH produced by HEL cells after IFN-gamma stimulation had fully intact kallikrein neutralizing activity. Moreover, conditioned media of IFN-gamma-treated HEL cells accumulated more secreted C1 INH in 8 days (6.7 micrograms/mL/10(8) cells) than untreated cells (0.6 microgram/mL/10(8) cells). Additional studies were done on plasma specimens from 22 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who received IFN-gamma daily for 4 days by intravenous infusion. Before treatment, the mean +/- SEM C1 INH levels in these patients was 438 +/- 16 micrograms/mL. At day 10 from the start of the infusion, the plasma C1 INH in these patients increased to 586 +/- 32 micrograms/mL (P less than .0001). The extent of rise of plasma C1 INH after IFN-gamma treatment was independent of dose from 0.01 to 40 U/m2. After 30 days, the mean plasma C1 INH levels decreased to 502 +/- 27 micrograms/mL. These combined studies indicate that IFN-gamma can increase C1 INH protein expression in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Lym-1 is a therapeutically promising IgG2a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that reacts with variant class II molecules expressed on B-lineage malignancies. To optimize antitumor immunotherapy with Lym-1, we determined whether granulocytes could participate in tumor lysis mediated by Lym-1 and whether recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) could influence this reaction. Granulocytes had minimal activity in mediating Lym-1 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, IFN-gamma markedly augmented and occasionally induced granulocyte Lym-1 ADCC in a dose-dependent fashion (optimal 100 U/mL). Granulocytes primed with IFN-gamma for 24 hours displayed greatly increased ADCC in the absence of further IFN-gamma exposure. In most individuals, IFN-gamma also enhanced PBMC Lym-1 ADCC. Interferon alfa (IFN-alpha), although able to enhance PBMC-mediated Lym-1 ADCC and non-ADCC lysis, had no effect on granulocyte activity. Lym-1 ADCC involved an interaction between Fc receptor-bearing granulocytes and Lym-1 antigen positive targets based on the following: (1) The reaction was Lym-1 dose-dependent with cytotoxicity detectable at concentrations as low as 0.5 microgram/mL. (2) An irrelevant, isotype-matched MoAb (UPC-10) was unable to mediate ADCC. (3) In the absence of Lym-1, granulocytes--with or without IFN-gamma--displayed no intrinsic tumor lytic ability. Conversely, without granulocytes, Lym-1 or Lym-1 plus IFN-gamma had no effect. (4) Protein A, which binds avidly to Lym-1, inhibited the reaction 95%. (5) IFN-gamma induced granulocyte expression of CD64, the IgG Fc receptor that binds murine IgG2a MoAbs. (6) Of nine malignant human cell lines, only the three that moderately or strongly expressed the Lym-1 antigen were consistently lysed. Preclinical studies such as these may provide a rational basis for designing clinical trials with Lym-1 in combination with IFN-gamma.\r"

Since we have previously shown that human neutrophils have at least two distinct tyrosine kinase activities, we examined protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human neutrophils stimulated with a variety of agonists. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine, the present study shows that the chemotactic peptides FMLP and leukotriene B4, the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the calcium ionophore A23187 induce an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of neutrophil proteins. This increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the concentration of the agonist, as well as on the time of exposure to the agonist. Fractionation experiments showed that both a 150,000 g cytosolic and a particulate preparation showed increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation with stimulation by FMLP or PMA, and showed that the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was slightly different in the FMLP- and PMA-stimulated cells. These data indicate that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an early event in the activation of human neutrophils by a variety of receptor-dependent and receptor-independent agonists.\r"

Subjects exercised for 30 min 3 times/wk at 70% of maximum O2 consumption (VO2max). Training increased VO2max by 12.5% but did not alter body weight, relative body fat, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Slight downward trends were apparent for fasting glucose and insulin, but glycosylated hemoglobin was unchanged. There were no changes in coagulation parameters of plasminogen, hematocrit, or alpha 2-antiplasmin. Plasma fibrinogen (303 +/- 24.2 vs. 256 +/- 12.3 mg/dl) and fibronectin (380 +/- 41.9 vs. 301 +/- 22.2 micrograms/ml) were significantly reduced (P less than 0.02) by exercise conditioning. Three assays of fibrinolytic activity (tissue plasminogen activator, euglobulin lysis time, and an isotopic measure of fibrinolysis) confirmed that neither basal fibrinolysis nor the fibrinolytic responses to venous occlusion and maximal exercise were significantly altered. Exercise conditioning may have antithrombotic effects in NIDDM by reducing plasma fibrinogen and fibronectin. Although the significance of the fall in fibronectin awaits further studies, the reduction in plasma fibrinogen gives a rationale for the use of exercise training in men with NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The carbohydrate compositions of pregnancy-derived hCG alpha (dissociated from intact hCG) and free alpha-subunit were analyzed using a combination of chemical analysis, lectin affinity chromatography, and glycosidase sensitivity. For direct compositional analysis, parallel samples were hydrolyzed in trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed for sialic acid and neutral sugars without prior derivatization. Separation of the monosaccharides was achieved by HPLC on a Dionex CarboPac column eluted at high pH, and the resolved monosaccharides were quantified by pulsed amperometric detection. The amounts of sugar that were found relative to peptide indicated the presence of two N-linked oligosaccharides per molecule on both hCG alpha and free alpha. Free alpha contained 2.5-fold higher amounts of sialic acid and galactose as well as a higher amount of N-acetylglucosamine than did hCG alpha. Free alpha also contained a 6-fold higher amount of fucose than did hCG alpha (1.2 vs. 0.2 residues of fucose/molecule). Serial fractionation of intact hCG alpha and free alpha molecules by lectin affinity chromatography indicated that virtually all of the hCG alpha-subunits contained at least one Concanavalin-A (Con-A)-binding site, whereas as many as 32% of the free alpha molecules could not bind to Con-A. Chromatography on Lens culinaris (Lch) resulted in 12% binding of hCG alpha and approximately 72% binding of free alpha (80-85% of the Con-A-bound free alpha and 47-48% of the Con-A-nonbound free alpha bound to Lch). Endoglycosidase-H (endo-H) treatment of hCG alpha released a portion of the oligosaccharides. The endo-H-released material appeared to be a monoantennary hybrid based on DEAE-binding properties and carbohydrate composition. In contrast to hCG alpha, free alpha was completely resistant to endo-H treatment. Incubation of endo-H-resistant hCG alpha with glycopeptidase-A resulted in the release of two components, which could be separated into monoantennary and biantennary fractions on the basis of size and charge. The collective data suggest that hCG alpha contains primarily monoantennary hybrid oligosaccharide structures and relatively little fucose. In contrast, free alpha contains primarily multiantennary oligosaccharide structures, and most of the free alpha molecules contain at least one oligosaccharide with fucose attached to the asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue.\r"

  ".W": "Preincubation of rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells with homologous interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ACTH secretion stimulated by CRF. The effect was seen in both monolayer and aggregate AP cell cultures and was not due to cytotoxicity. In monolayer cultures IFN-gamma also inhibited PRL and GH release stimulated by various hypothalamic releasing factors. IFN-gamma did not affect the time kinetics of the ACTH response to CRF. The dose needed for half-maximal inhibition amounted to approximately 1 (antiviral) U/ml. The effect of IFN-gamma was abrogated by an IFN-gamma-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, ACTH secretion by the AP cells was not affected by the anti-IFN-gamma antibody added alone, indicating that in the culture system no endogenous IFN-gamma is operational in regulating the ACTH response studied. Of the other cytokines tested [interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta)] only TNF-alpha and IL-6 were found to inhibit CRF-stimulated ACTH release, although this inhibition was less pronounced than that caused by IFN-gamma. Lipopolysaccharide, even at high doses, did not significantly inhibit the ACTH response to CRF. These results identify IFN-gamma as one of the inflammatory cytokines that, like IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, have the potential to regulate pituitary function.\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme (ACE), estimated by the specific binding of the ACE inhibitor [125I]iodo-MK-351A, is localized on multiple ovarian structures, including follicular granulosa cells, corpora lutea, terminal epithelium, and ovarian blood vessels, but total ovarian ACE does not display a cyclic pattern of variation during the rat estrous cycle. We have previously shown that ACE is localized on the granulosa cell layer of a subpopulation of rat ovarian follicles. Our present study shows that ovarian granulosa cells contain high affinity [binding site affinity (Kd), approximately 90 pM] and low capacity [binding site density (Bmax), approximately 12 fmol/2.5 X 10(5) cells] [125I]iodo-MK-351A-binding sites and convert [125I]iodo-Ang I to [125I]iodo-Ang II (greater than 85% of this conversion was inhibited by the ACE inhibitor captopril). Throughout the rat estrous cycle, 94-100% of developing follicles and 89-96% of atretic follicles contained high levels of ACE; however, ACE was either not observed or its levels were very low in preovulatory follicles. These findings indicate the presence of high levels of biologically active ACE on the surface of granulosa cells and suggest a potential role for follicular ACE in early stages of follicular maturation and atresia. Although ACE is known to process a variety of peptides found within the ovary, and these peptides may have opposing effects on follicular maturation, we attempted to define the cumulative effect of ACE inhibition on follicular maturation. Short and long term (6- and 14-day) infusions of captopril (6-day, 30.5 +/- 3.5 ova; 14-day, 28.5 +/- 7.5 ova) in immature rats, in which ovulation was induced by sequential treatments with PMSG and hCG, did not significantly affect ovulation compared with that in vehicle-infused control rats (6-day, 22.4 +/- 2.4 ova; 14-day, 20.8 +/- 3.1 ova), suggesting that ACE inhibition does not modify the follicular selection process in a way that affects ovulation. This may explain the lack of any reports of adverse effects of clinically used ACE inhibitors on ovulation.\r"

The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist domperidone blocked the inhibitory effect of salt load on POMC mRNA in the neurointermediate lobe, while the D2 agonist bromocriptine mimicked the effect of salt load. Pharmacological agents affecting D1 receptors, beta-adrenoceptors, and endogenous serotonin levels did not block the decrease in POMC mRNA levels after a salt load. The level of transcription of the POMC gene in the neurointermediate lobe was investigated using a nuclear run-on transcription assay. Transcription of POMC was found to be unchanged after a salt load, indicating that an osmotic stimulus does not decrease POMC mRNA levels by a specific change in the level of transcription.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the oligosaccharide moieties of recombinant human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and the role of these glycans in hTPO antigenicity in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. To determine whether hTPO carbohydrate moieties were N-linked, O-linked, or both, and to obtain information about the characteristics of the carbohydrate component(s), we digested hTPO with deglycosylating enzymes of varying specificity. Proteins in CHO-TPO cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and hTPO was immunoprecipitated with anti-hTPO antibodies present in Hashimoto's thyroiditis serum. Digestion with endoglycosidase (endo) F, which removes both complex and polymannose N-linked glycans, increased the electrophoretic mobility of the hTPO doublet from approximately 115 kD and 110 kD to 110 kD and 105 kD. Endo H, which acts similarly to endo F, but only on polymannose, and not complex, glycans, had a similar effect. In contrast, O-glycanase and neuraminidase, which remove O-linked glycans and terminal neuraminic acid, respectively, did not alter the mobility of radiolabeled hTPO. Radiolabeled recombinant hTPO was retained by concanavalin A, but not by wheat germ agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin 1, peanut agglutinin and Ulex europaeus lectins. To determine whether or not the glycan moieties in hTPO play a role in the disease-associated epitopes in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, radiolabeled recombinant hTPO was immunoprecipitated after digestion with N-glycanase. Removal of the N-linked carbohydrate chains with endo F and endo H did not prevent antibody binding. In summary, the present data indicate that: i) hTPO expressed in CHO cells contains N-linked, but not O-linked glycan moieties; ii) the N-linked carbohydrate is primarily of the polymannose variety; and, iii) the glycan moieties do not contribute to the hTPO epitopes in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that TRH exerts a stimulatory effect on the secretion of both TSH and PRL. Clinically, hyperprolactinemia is usually present in hypothyroid women, but not men. In experimental studies, results vary because of the sexes, and treatments of animals differ. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the physiological control of PRL secretion in hypothyroid female rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats that were surgically ovariectomized (OVX) and/or thyroidectomized (Tx) for 2 weeks were used. Serial blood samples were collected through indwelling intraatrial catheters, and plasma PRL and TSH levels were measured by RIA. We found that OVX + Tx and polyestradiol phosphate (PEP; 0.1 mg/rat, sc)-treated rats exhibited significantly higher basal PRL and TSH levels and afternoon surge PRL levels than sham Tx rats with the same treatments. On the other hand, if OVX + Tx rats were not treated with estrogen, their plasma PRL levels were not significantly different from those in sham Tx controls. If challenged with TRH (1 microgram/rat, iv), significantly higher PRL responses were found in OVX + Tx + PEP rats than in sham Tx rats. The contents of TRH in the median eminence of Tx rats, however, were not different from those in sham Tx rats. When challenged with domperidone (10 micrograms/rat, iv), a dopamine antagonist, no difference in PRL increments was found in the two groups of animals. Treatment with CB154, a potent dopamine agonist, did not eliminate the difference in basal PRL levels between the two groups. Pretreatment with a smaller dose of domperidone (1 microgram/rat), however, enhanced the PRL-releasing effect of TRH more in Tx than in sham Tx rats. When T4 (2 or 10 micrograms/100 g BW.day for 21 days) was replaced in Tx rats starting the second day after Tx, both basal and TRH-stimulated PRL secretion were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the increased PRL levels in OVX + Tx + PEP rats may be due to increased responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland to TRH, and not to a decreased responsiveness to dopamine. In addition, the elevation of plasma PRL in OVX + Tx + PEP rats is negatively correlated with plasma levels of thyroid hormone.\r"

The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the distribution of PRF activity between the neural and intermediate lobes, and 2) to assess the PRF activity of cultured posterior pituitary cells. Posterior pituitaries from adult male rats were dispersed with trypsin and cultured for 1-7 days. Cultured cells or intact posterior pituitaries were extracted with acid and lyophilized. PRF activity was determined by the ability of reconstituted extracts to increase PRL release from cultured anterior pituitary cells. Upon dissection of the posterior pituitary, PRF activity was primarily present in the intermediate lobe. There was minimal contamination between the two lobes, as indicated by the localization of 90% of the total oxytocin in the neural lobe and 95% of alpha MSH in the intermediate lobe. Extracts from intact posterior pituitaries and posterior pituitary cells cultured for 4 days stimulated PRL secretion in a similar dose-dependent manner. Cultured liver and cerebral cortex cells had very low PRF activity. Both oxytocin and dopamine, two neuronal markers, were reduced to less than 5% of their original values within 1 week of cell culture. There was also a significant reduction in the cell content of alpha MSH. On the other hand, PRF activity was relatively stable during culture. Incubation of posterior pituitary cells for 4 days with either cycloheximide or PRL caused a 55-60% reduction of the PRF activity of the cells. We conclude the following. 1) PRF is localized, almost exclusively, in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. 2) PRF activity is present within nonneuronal cells, either melanotrophs or a small subpopulation of nonopioid-producing cells. 3) PRF is tissue specific, and its presence in cultured posterior pituitary cells depends at least in part on de novo synthesis. 4) The synthesis and/or release of PRF may be subjected to short loop negative feedback regulation by PRL.\r"

The mechanism of this inhibition has been unclear, especially since glucocorticoids enhance the in vitro GH response of pituitary cells to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). We investigated the possibility that hypothalamic somatostatin might be mediating these dichotomous observations by using passive immunization techniques. The GH response to GHRH was significantly blunted in rats pretreated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, compared to that in normal animals. In marked contrast, the immunoneutralization of somatostatin resulted in a significantly enhanced GH response to GHRH in dexamethasone-treated animals. These results suggest that the previously described inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on GH secretion in vivo are mediated via altered hypothalamic somatostatin tone.\r"

The animals were treated with a potent GnRH antagonist, Ac-D-pClPhe-D-pClPhe-D-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Arg-Leu-Arg-Pro-D-Ala-+ ++NH2CH3COOH (Org 30276; 0.5 mg/kg BW, sc, twice daily) for 10 days. Groups of the antagonist-treated rats were implanted at the beginning of the injections with Silastic capsules containing testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or diethylstilbestrol (DES). Groups treated with the antagonist alone or vehicle served as controls. The antagonist treatment decreased unoccupied pituitary receptors of GnRH by 93% (P less than 0.001), serum LH by 34% (P less than 0.01), and serum FSH by 30% (P less than 0.05), and serum T became undetectable (less than 0.10 nmol/liter). Compared to antagonist treatment alone, no further effects on serum or pituitary LH levels found after steroid replacements. In contrast, the antagonist-induced decreases in serum and pituitary FSH (30% and 70%, respectively; P less than 0.05-0.01) were totally reversed by the T and DHT implants, but not by DES. Pituitary levels of the LH beta-subunit mRNA were decreased by 60% (P less than 0.01) after antagonist treatment. Combination treatment with androgens had no further effect on this mRNA, whereas DES partially reversed this suppression (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the pituitary mRNA level of the FSH beta-subunit, which decreased with antagonist treatment by 90% (P less than 0.01), returned to the control level with T and DHT replacements, but only partially with DES. The pituitary mRNA level of the common alpha-subunit was significantly suppressed only by combined antagonist plus DHT treatment (P less than 0.01). However, combination of DES with the antagonist increased alpha-subunit mRNA levels 2.4-fold (P less than 0.05) compared to antagonist treatment alone. It is concluded that the suppression of gonadotropin secretion by GnRH antagonist treatment is accompanied in male rats by a parallel reduction in mRNA levels of the gonadotropin beta-subunits. Sex steroid replacement of the antagonist-treated animals selectively reverses some of the mRNA changes. Androgens (T and DHT) increase the mRNA of FSH beta-subunit, but have no effect on the LH beta-subunit. Estrogen increases the mRNA levels of common alpha- and LH beta-subunits and slightly increases that of FSH beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90276364\r", 
  ".W": "To further characterize the subcellular mechanisms by which inhibin suppresses GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin release, anterior pituitary cells from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on day 2 of culture with or without purified 31-kDa bovine inhibin (1-300 pM) for a further 3 days. On day 5, the pretreated cells were washed and incubated in the absence or presence of various secretagogues for 4 h. At the end of the stimulation, the media were saved, and cells were lysed for measurement of both extracellular and intracellular FSH and LH by specific RIAs. Released hormone was expressed as the proportion of total (released plus intracellular) hormone that was available for release in each case. This manipulation of the data corrects for the differential effect of the inhibin pretreatments to suppress intracellular FSH before the stimulation period. Pretreatment for 3 days with inhibin suppressed the proportions of FSH and LH released during 4 h in response to 1) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM), an activator of protein kinase-C, by maxima of 48% and 53% with inhibin median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 17 and 18 pM, respectively; 2) mezerein (100 nM), another type of activator of protein kinase-C, by maxima of 49% and 50% with inhibin IC50 of 19 and 20 pM, respectively; 3) high extracellular K+ (60 mM) by 42% (P less than 0.01) and 38% (P less than 0.01), respectively, with 130 pM inhibin; 4) the calcium ionophore, A23187 (100 microM) by maxima of 54% and 56% with IC50 of 18 and 17 pM, respectively; and 5) GnRH (10 nM) by maxima of 52% and 53% with IC50 of 18 and 19 pM, respectively. However, inhibin had no effect on the proportional release of gonadotropin induced by melittin, an activator of phospholipase-A2. Finally, inhibin had no effect on ACTH release either under basal conditions or in response to CRF (10 nM), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM), or A23187 (100 microM). We conclude that inhibin suppresses the stimulated release of hormones from gonadotrophs in part by a mechanism common to both gonadotropins that is independent of the previously described inhibitory effect of inhibin on the GnRH receptor. The results are consistent with an action at a site(s) beyond the GnRH receptor, such as protein kinase-C and calmodulin.\r"

Two forms of inhibin were identified with Mr of 34 and 31 Kd composed of subunits (alpha, beta) of 24 and 15 Kd and 21 and 15 Kd respectively. Both forms are bioactive in an inhibin in vitro bioassay and immunoactive with potencies comparable to or higher than purified bovine inhibin. Amino acid analyses and NH2-terminal sequences of each of the subunits are consistent with those predicted from their cDNA structures. The inhibin alpha- but not beta-subunit is glycosylated based on its binding to the lectins concanavalin A and wheat germ lectin. The difference in molecular weight of 31 and 34 Kd inhibin is attributed to variation in glycosylation of the alpha-subunit. The 31+34 Kd inhibin is heterogeneous on isoelectric focusing gels consisting of four isoforms in the pH range 6.2-7.6. Inhibition also exhibits in vivo biological activity by suppressing serum FSH but not LH in castrate male rats. These physicochemical and biological characteristics of recombinant human inhibin are similar to those described for native inhibin isolated from a variety of other species.\r"

Our hypothesis was that the concentration of bioactive estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) may be important in the regulation of fibroid growth. The purpose of this study was to determine ER and PR content in fibroids and myometria from women pretreated with GnRH-a compared with controls. Tissue was obtained from 20 premenopausal women with uterine fibroids who were randomized to receive either leuprolide acetate depot, 3.75 mg intramuscularly every 28 days for four injections (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) before myomectomy. The mean fibroid ER and PR content was significantly greater than the mean myometrial ER and PR content. The mean fibroid ER content for GnRH-a-treated patients was significantly greater than in placebo-treated patients (143.3 +/- 22.8 versus 36.1 +/- 14.3 fmol/mg). The mean fibroid PR and the mean myometrial ER and PR content were not significantly different between treatment groups. Clinically, the significant increase in fibroid ER may be an explanation for the rapid regrowth of fibroids observed after the cessation of GnRH-a therapy.\r"

Both patients presented unilateral Mullerian derivatives (fallopian tube) identified by microscopic examination of surgically excised internal genital tissue. Biochemical studies performed in genital skin-derived fibroblasts from one of the affected subjects showed the existence of a specific and saturable 8.2 to 8.4 S cytosolic and 3.4 S nuclear androgen receptor exhibiting a Kd of 1.32 nmol/L. These mutant cells, however, clearly presented a significantly low maximal nuclear [3H]-5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone uptake (71.0 fmol/mg of deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]; control strain, 284 fmol/mg DNA). Thus, an impaired uptake of the androgen receptor complex at the nuclear level was probably the cause of the complete absence of phenotypic expression of androgen action in this family. The overall findings are on line with the well-demonstrated genetic and molecular heterogeneity of the AIS.\r"

Patients receiving only gonadotropin served as controls. Sixty patients were selected for this study; 55 reached laparoscopy. Whereas patients receiving either gonadotropin alone or simultaneous analog and gonadotropin had similar pregnancy rates, this was much higher in the patients undergoing a prolonged, medically induced hypoestrogenism. Prolonged analog pretreatment before ovarian stimulation may give better chances of success in endometriosis patients undergoing assisted reproduction techniques.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to examine the predictive value of low estradiol (E2) after 5 days of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) stimulation response to therapy in that cycle. We further examined whether the outcome of such cycles can be improved by increasing the hMG dose. When 18 cycles in which day 8 E2 was less than or equal to 50 pg/mL were compared with 48 cycles with corresponding E2 levels of 51 to 150 pg/mL, the former showed a significantly worse response to subsequent hMG therapy. To determine the effect of an increase in hMG dose we studied 48 cycles with day 8 E2 of 51 to 150 pg/mL. In 32 cycles hMG dose was increased from three to a mean of five ampules a day, after 5 days of therapy. In 16 cycles it was kept constant at three ampules per day. Although a tendency towards lower fertilization rate was observed in the higher hMG groups, no significant differences were observed in the results between the two groups. We thus conclude that very low E2 levels after 5 days of gonadotropin therapy are predictive of low response in that cycle, and that in cycles with day 8 E2 of 51 to 150 pg/mL, increasing the dosage of hMG on day 8 and beyond does not alter the course of the cycle.\r"

Approximately 20% of the patients receiving GnRH-a during the follicular or luteal phase had developed ovarian cysts. However, the number of cysts per patient was significantly higher in the follicular phase compared with luteal phase. Systematic aspiration of those cysts under local anesthesia permitted the start of ovarian stimulation with hMG as scheduled on day 16 after GnRH-a administration. Follicular fluid content of the cysts revealed similar levels of steroids to those in normal follicles. These cysts contained few cells and no egg. In vitro fertilization treatment was more successful in patients whose cysts were aspirated during the luteal phase than in those with cysts during the follicular phase. We concluded that luteal phase cysts are more benign than follicular phase cysts, and it is possible that they represent an enlargement of pre-existing corpora lutea.\r"

Neither the peak serum E2 level attained nor the number of days of stimulation required bore a relationship to the BMI or the total body weight of these women. Whereas the mean number of oocytes aspirated from women with BMI less than 19.1 was higher (6.4 +/- 3.2) compared with obese women (BMI greater than 27.6, 4.8 +/- 2.6), the rate of fertilization was not different for both BMI extremes. It is concluded that factors other than BMI or total body weight have more important influences on the response to hyperstimulation in normal women.\r"

Vital signs and psychomotoric tests were assessed before injection of midazolam, before injection of flumazenil or placebo, and 5, 15, 30, 60, 240, and 360 min afterward. Thirty-six patients received flumazenil, 33 placebo. All parameters returned to pre-sedation levels within 5 min in all patients in the flumazenil group, with significant differences as compared with placebo after 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Flumazenil was well tolerated. No rebound sedation was observed. Flumazenil is a safe and effective benzodiazepine antagonist. The combination of midazolam with flumazenil makes it possible to reduce the recovery period and is useful in outpatient endoscopy.\r"

A slow growing mycobacterium, biochemically and genetically identical to M paratuberculosis, the causative agent of enteritis in ruminants (Johne's disease), has been isolated from gut specimens of patients affected by Crohn's disease. If M paratuberculosis or other mycobacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, then patients may have been sensitised to these mycobacteria or show an anergy immune reaction. We therefore investigated the T-cell mediated immune response to sonicates of M paratuberculosis, M kansasii, M avium, and M tuberculosis in 35 patients with Crohn's disease, 28 with ulcerative colitis, and 25 controls using a macrophage inhibition factor assay on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Two types of reaction patterns were identified--that is, 'responders' (subjects with a macrophage inhibition factor assay in which a dose response relation was present and a percentage of inhibition exceeding 20%), and 'non-responders'. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of responders (59%-80%) and non-responders (20%-41%) to these mycobacteria between the group of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and control group. We found also that a large proportion of controls showed T-cell immunisation to the mycobacteria which supports the contention that the antigens are practically commensal. Our results do not support the proposed involvement of mycobacteria in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.\r"

Hexapeptide did not produce tachyphylaxis but did produce a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. Differences in the increase in intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]i) and the pattern of inositol phosphate production indicate that Ang-(3-8) and maximal concentrations of Ang II mobilize calcium through different mechanisms. The calcium-mobilizing mechanisms that predominate appear to depend on the concentration of angiotensin. Concentrations of Ang II greater than 10(-8) M produce sharp calcium transients in which the [Ca2+]i returns close to baseline within 1 minute after stimulation, but concentrations of Ang II equal to or less than 3 x 10(-9) M result in a plateau increase in calcium. Pretreatment with Bordetella pertussis toxin does not abolish either the calcium transient induced by Ang II or the plateau phase induced by Ang-(3-8), indicating that the GTP-transducing protein that couples the receptor to phospholipase C or, possibly, a receptor-operated calcium channel is not Bordetella pertussis toxin sensitive.\r"

We determined whether peripheral sympathectomy would enhance the hypotensive actions of atrial natriuretic factor and convert the increase in total peripheral resistance to peripheral vasodilation. Sympathectomized rats studied included 1) conscious rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine alone (partially sympathectomized) and 2) conscious anephric rats sympathectomized with adrenal demedullation and 6-hydroxydopamine (totally sympathectomized), with vascular tone returned to levels of sham-operated (control) rats with norepinephrine infusion. Sympathectomized rats and appropriate control rats received rat atrial natriuretic factor infusion (0.5 microgram/kg/min) or vehicle for 1 hour. Atrial natriuretic factor infusion lowered mean arterial pressure and increased hematocrit in control rats but not in partially sympathectomized rats. Changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were not significantly different between control and partially sympathectomized rats. In totally sympathectomized rats, atrial natriuretic factor lowered mean arterial pressure more than in control rats; changes in cardiac output were nearly identical in both groups, but there were no changes in total peripheral resistance from control levels in the totally sympathectomized group. Changes in plasma volume and central venous pressure were similar in totally sympathectomized rats and control rats. These findings suggest that reflex sympathetic activity largely mediated atrial natriuretic factor-induced increases in total peripheral resistance but failed to reveal an atrial natriuretic factor-mediated sustained vasodilation in the absence of sympathetic reflexes. Furthermore, atrial natriuretic factor decreased cardiac output, central venous pressure, and plasma volume independent of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

This inhibitor was also active against monkey renin, although there was less inhibition of renin in pig, rabbit, and rat. ES-8891 did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and urinary kallikrein at a concentration of 10(-5) M. A single oral administration of ES-8891 (10 or 30 mg/kg) to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets caused a dose-related decrease in plasma renin activity and blood pressure. ES-8891 (30 mg/kg) produced an 80% inhibition of plasma renin activity, which lasted for more than 6 hours. Kidney renin messenger RNA was not significantly changed 6 hours after oral administration of ES-8891 (30 mg/kg). A single oral administration of 240 mg ES-8891 to healthy human volunteers (n = 6) produced a significant inhibition of plasma renin activity (75% inhibition at 0.5 and 1 hour, 50% inhibition at 2 hours) with a good correlation of plasma levels of ES-8891. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate, and no adverse effects were observed. These results suggest that ES-8891 is an orally active human renin inhibitor that may be clinically useful.\r"

One of these IL-2-dependent T cell lines demonstrated non-MHC-restricted cytolytic function against tumor targets, syngeneic and allogeneic fibroblasts, and PHA blasts from allogeneic donors. The other cell line only became cytotoxic in the presence of lectin or anti-CD3 antibody. The two cell lines also differed in their expression of the T-200 gene products CD45RO (gp180) and CD45RA (gp220). Both cell lines produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta and IFN-gamma activity when activated with mitogens or PMA and IL-1. The in vitro functions of these T-cell lines suggest a potential role for alpha/beta double-negative T lymphocytes in tissue injury resembling graft-vs-host disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies from our laboratory have shown, for the first time, that a synthetic peptide from that TCR VB chain used preferentially by encephalitogenic T cells induced the formation of protective, MHC class I-restricted T cells and prevented the development of EAE in Lewis rats. In this report we 1) demonstrate that immunization with the TCR-VB8-39-59 peptide generated peptide-specific antibodies that protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced by either of the two distinct encephalitogenic epitopes of basic protein, and 2) characterize the production and biologic functions of rat and rabbit antibody responses to the TCR peptide. The antibodies in both species increased in titer over time, were highly specific for the immunogen by direct reaction and inhibition assays, stained only VB8+ T cells, and suppressed clinical signs and to lesser extent the number of histologic lesions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mediated by VB8+ T cells. Coupled with our previous work, these results indicate that both humoral and cellular responses to the TCR-VB8-39-59 peptide can contribute independent immunoregulatory effects on encephalitogenic T lymphocytes that use common V region genes in response to epitopes of myelin basic protein.\r"

In our study we directly tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of in vivo administered anti-IFN-gamma mAb on rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, and comparing its effect on rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts placed on the same individual mice. We found that anti-IFN-gamma mAb blocked the rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, but had no effect on the rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts. These results demonstrate that endogenously produced IFN-gamma is critical for rejection of MHC class II disparate skin allografts, but not for rejection of MHC class I disparate skin allografts. Thus, this study strongly supports the concept that MHC class II rejection responses require IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression on keratinocytes of the allograft.\r"

To this aim, panels of house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp)-specific TLC were generated from two atopic Dp-allergic patients, suffering from severe atopic dermatitis (AD1) and allergic asthma (AD2), respectively, and from a non-atopic individual (NAD). From AD1 additional TLC were cloned specific for tetanus toxoid or Candida albicans, both Ag that were not relevant for the atopic state of this patient. Secretion of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma was determined after specific stimulation of these TLC, using autologous monocytes as APC. With respect to the production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, clearly distinct profiles were observed. All Dp-specific TLC from both atopic donors produced IL-4 but not IFN-gamma, whereas the Dp-specific TLC from NAD, as well as the tetanus toxoid- and C. albicans-specific TLC from AD1, all produced IFN-gamma but not or small quantities of IL-4. Most TLC from all panels produced IL-2. These lymphokine profiles were consistent for at least 3 days and were neither dependent on the dose of allergen nor on the atopic or nonatopic state of the donor of APC. The functional consequence of these restricted lymphokine profiles was stressed by the observation that, whereas Dp-specific TLC from AD1 and AD2 supported in vitro IgE production, this support could be abrogated by a Dp-specific TLC from NAD. The present results suggest that CD4+ T lymphocytes that produce IL-4, but not IFN-gamma, occur in high frequencies in the allergen-specific T cell repertoires of atopic donors, which may have important implications for the pathomechanism of atopic disease.\r"

Maximal TNF activity is routinely detected after 48 to 72 h of culture. IL-2 and IL-4 were both growth promoting for human T cells but only IL-2 could efficiently induce TNF production. The production of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta differed greatly in kinetics. An early intracytoplasmatic production of TNF-alpha after 6 h was detected in both monocytes and T cells whereas a late production of TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) after 48 h, occurred in the T cell population. Induction of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta production by Staphylococcal enterotoxin requires the presence of both monocytes and T cells. The CD4+45R- but not CD4+45R+ and CD8+ cells supported TNF-alpha production in monocytes. The main lytic component from Staphylococcal enterotoxin-activated mononuclear cells is TNF-beta. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produced about equal amounts of biologically active TNF into the culture supernatants but a fourfold higher frequency of TNF-beta producing cells was demonstrated among CD4+ vs CD8+ cells. The CD4+45R- T cell subset was an efficient producer of TNF-beta and IFN-gamma whereas the CD4+45R+ T cell subset produced significant amounts of TNF-beta but only marginal amounts of IFN-gamma.\r"

There were distinct patterns in the ability of different cytokines to augment class II histocompatibility Ag expression. IL-4 and GM-CSF selectively increased only HLA-DR and HLA-DP, but did not increase HLA-DQ antigens on monocytes. IFN-gamma, however, was able to augment the expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ Ag.

  ".W": "IL-4 is a T cell-derived lymphokine that has multiple biologic functions, affecting B cells, T cells, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. We report that IL-4 also affects human skin fibroblasts. These effects were primarily in modulating the effects of other mediators of inflammation on these cells, with IL-4 producing little or no effects by itself. Synthesis of C proteins in human skin fibroblasts is modulated by TNF and other mediators of inflammation. TNF increased synthesis of factor B by 18.6-fold; IL-4 reduced the TNF effect on factor B synthesis by 83%. This effect started with concentrations of IL-4 as low as 0.1 ng/ml. The effect of IL-4 on the TNF-induced increase in synthesis of factor B occurred after 2 h incubation, the time when the effects of TNF alone were first observed. IL-4 also abrogated the effects of IL-1 and LPS on factor B synthesis, but did not affect the increase in synthesis of factor B induced by IFN-gamma. In contrast to the pattern for effect of IL-4 on factor B synthesis, the TNF-induced rate of synthesis of C3 was augmented by IL-4. The specificity of the IL-4 effect was also apparent when comparing the effect of IL-4 on the TNF-induced synthesis of factor B to the effects on total protein synthesis (increased 1.5-fold) and the TNF-induced increases in synthesis in C1r, C1s, C1 inhibitor, C2, and factor H (no changes). The IL-4-induced decrease in synthesis of factor B was mediated at a pretranslational level and was dependent on synthesis of a new protein. This interaction between IL-4 and mediators of inflammation can potentially modulate the inflammatory response in the setting of activation of Th cells.\r"

  ".U": "90278077\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of the human (hu) IFN-gamma-R has been studied in Raji and IM9 cells (two B lymphoblastoid cell lines) and in THP-1 cells (a monocytic cell line) with respect to IFN-gamma binding sites, receptor protein and mRNA levels. Although, in these three cell lines, the hu-IFN-gamma-R mRNA was expressed to the same extent, the high affinity receptor was expressed differently both in cell surface receptor binding and amount of receptor protein. Various ligands are able to modulate the expression of their own receptor. We investigated the modulation of the hu-IFN-gamma-R by its ligand. Hu-IFN-gamma induced a rapid and dose-dependent decrease of its cell surface receptor number without alteration of receptor affinity, amounts of receptor protein or hu-IFN-gamma-R mRNA accumulation and stability. Thus, in Raji, IM9, and THP-1 cells, the hu-IFN-gamma had no effect on its receptor gene expression and the cell surface decrease was simply due to ligand blocking and receptor internalization rather than true down-regulation. The second messenger in the hu-IFN-gamma signal transduction pathway is not well characterized, but activation of protein kinase C has been reported in some cases. Therefore, the modulation of the hu-IFN-gamma-R expression by PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C and a modulator of other receptor expression, has been investigated. In Raji and IM9 cells, PMA had no or few effects on the cell surface receptor number and no detectable effect on the receptor protein or on mRNA levels. In contrast, in THP-1 cells, PMA treatment induced a time and dose-dependent five- to sixfold increase of the cell surface receptors due to a rapid and persistent increase of the hu-IFN-gamma-R gene expression in THP-1 cells was specifically inhibited or reversed by hu-IFN-gamma treatment. The modulation of the hu-IFN-gamma-R expression by PMA in THP-1 cells and by hu-IFN-gamma in PMA-treated THP-1 cells seems associated with their effect on monocyte-macrophage differentiation and/or macrophage activation.\r"

The expression of CSF-1 and the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) and their regulation were examined in cultures of mouse mesangial cells (MC). The concentration of CSF-1 in the medium of cultured MC increased linearly with time over 24 h. IFN-gamma stimulated and dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibited CSF-1 production in a dose-dependent manner. MC expression of CSF-1 mRNA was shown by Northern blot analysis, and CSF-1 mRNA levels were increased within 4 h of IFN-gamma addition and inhibited within 4 h of dibutyryl cyclic AMP addition. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that 90% of the untreated cultured MC expressed CSF-1. In addition, CSF-1R expression by MC was demonstrated by immunofluorescence with anti-receptor antibody, specific binding of [125I] CSF-1, and expression of the CSF-1R mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Thus, mouse MC, specialized pericytes of non-bone marrow origin, not only produce CSF-1 but also express receptors for CSF-1.

  ".W": "Cocaine and its derivatives blunted responses of neutrophils (cell/cell aggregation, up-regulation of the receptor for C3bi (CR3, CD11b/CD18), generation of superoxide anion (O2-) and degranulation to various stimuli. The order of potency of these agents was the same as that for local anesthesia: tetracaine greater than bupivacaine greater than cocaine greater than lidocaine. Neutrophil aggregation elicited by the chemoattractant FMLP (10(-7) M) was inhibited by cocaine (10 mM) to 13.6 +/- 6% of control (p less than 0.002); the IC50 was approximately 4 mM. Cocaine and the other local anesthetics not only inhibited the upregulation of CR3 and O2- generation, but also blocked degranulation of cytochalasin B-treated cells. Cocaine (10 mM) reduced beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme secretion to 4.3 +/- 0.7 and 13 +/- 2.2% controls, respectively; its IC50 was 4 mM. Local anesthetics added after ligand/receptor engagement (FMLP) interrupted aggregation and halted generation of O2-. Moreover, local anesthetics rapidly inhibited aggregation, O2- generation, and degranulation elicited by PMA (1 microgram/ml) or the Ca ionophore A23187 (10 microM): the effects of cocaine could therefore not be attributed to unique actions at the FMLP receptor. Peak levels of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca]i) at 5 to 10 s, and levels of [Ca]i 120 s after FMLP in Fura 2-loaded cells were significantly lower in cells treated with lidocaine, findings that could be explained by enhanced 45Ca2+ efflux from neutrophils. In cells loaded with bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescine (pH indicator) local anesthetics failed to affect the initial FMLP-induced (0 to 15 s) drop of pHi but inhibited the later (120 s) realkalinization of the cytosol (lidocaine, bupivacaine). Most remarkably, autoradiographs of SDS gels prepared from stimulated, 32P-labeled neutrophils treated with local anesthetics showed no difference from resting cells, either with respect to patterns of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation or their kinetics. Labeling of a 47-kDa protein, a component of the reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase system, was unchanged. The effects of local anesthetics, which blunt neutrophil responses without affecting protein phosphorylation, suggest that protein phosphorylation is an insufficient signal for neutrophil activation. Inasmuch as cocaine and its derivatives affect cell functions at sites distal to activation of protein kinase C, these agents should prove useful in uncoupling protein phosphorylation from functional responses.\r"

The EBV-activating role of intracellular Ca2+, as potentiated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and suppressed by cAMP, was analyzed in the cells through effects of agonists and antagonists of these second messenger pathways. Early Ag (EA) was induced in 10% of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (A23187). EA induction with anti-IgG or A23187 was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, trifluoperazine. The DAG pathway had a potentiating but not direct effect on EBV activation because: 1) the DAG analog, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), an agonist for protein kinase C, alone induced only 2% EA-positive cells, 2) diC8 synergized with A23187 for EA induction, and 3) the protein kinase C antagonist, staurosporine, almost completely inhibited EA induction by anti-IgG. When cells were reincubated in medium with fresh diC8 and A23187 at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, EA induction at 24 h reached the levels seen with anti-IgG stimulation. A cAMP-mediated pathway suppressed EBV activation because dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP, plus blockage of phosphodiesterase by theophylline, or use of forskolin, inhibited EA induction with anti-IgG. Although the principal stimulatory role in EBV activation of a Ca2(+)-mediated, second messenger pathway, as synergized by DAG and inhibited by cAMP, was established, we did not explain the significant lag in EA induction by A23187 and diC8 as compared with anti-IgG induction of EA. We conclude that EBV genome activation with anti-IgG is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin and DAG pathways in Akata cells, that the cAMP pathway suppresses EA induction by anti-IgG, and that a mechanism regulating the speed of EA induction remains unexplained.\r"

Cellular responses were assessed in vitro by lymphoproliferation and production of IFN-gamma; antigamete antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and competitive ELISA. Cells from all the malaria immune donors responded to the gametocyte lysate in both assays while cells from nonimmune donors gave only weak proliferative responses. Antigamete antibodies were detected in the serum of all the immune donors but not in serum from nonimmunes. Nonimmune donors were completely unresponsive to the purified 48/45-kDa surface Ag while cells from 40% of immune donors responded by either proliferation or IFN-gamma production. Only 3 of 30 immune donors had detectable antibodies to the 48/45-kDa Ag.

  ".W": "The effect of heat shock on the expression of the nuclear protooncogenes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc was studied in human lymphoid cells. Heat shock caused an increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels and a decrease in c-myc mRNA levels in pre-B (Hyon) and T (DND-41) cell lines as well as in freshly isolated normal human thymocytes. The changes in the mRNA levels of these protooncogenes in Hyon cells were most pronounced at 42 and 43 degrees C; kinetic analysis demonstrated that the changes could be detected within 30 min of heat shock. Altered transcription of c-fos and c-myc genes was the primary effect of heat shock. Secondarily, heat shock of Hyon cells stabilized the c-myc mRNA level by increasing its half-life from 24 to 45 min. The overall effect of heat shock on c-myc mRNA level, however, was a marked inhibition of its transcription. These results demonstrate that the transcription of nuclear protooncogenes is regulated by heat shock indicating a role for nuclear protooncogenes in the stress response of lymphoid cells.\r"

  ".U": "90278099\r", 
  ".W": "The T cell response to lambda-repressor is directed to a 15 amino acid peptide (P12-26) of the protein in A/J mice. Previous studies have demonstrated a preferential use of V alpha 2 and V beta 1 amongst the T cell hybridomas specific for P12-26 in the context of I-Ek. By using the polymerase chain reaction, the sequences of a panel of the T cells using V alpha 2 and V beta 1 were determined. A highly conserved alpha-chain V-J junctional sequence was found in six of the eight T cell hybrids. This consensus alpha-chain VJ sequence may be combined with different members of V alpha 2, indicating a more restricted selection on the junctional region than on the V element in these T cells. In contrast, greater diversities were found on the V-D-J region of beta-chains despite the same V beta 1 and J beta 2.1 were used. However, a highly conserved glutamic acid residue was found at the same position of beta-chains where a similar conservation was identified in cytochrome c-specific T cells. The correlation of the TCR sequence with the fine specificities of these T cells suggests that a single amino acid deletion in the V alpha-J alpha region may reduce the P12-26 response and abolish the recognition of an altered peptide [Phe22] P12-26. In addition, three amino acid difference in the V-D-J region of the beta-chain also determine the P12-26 reactivity. Thus the V(D)J junctional regions of both alpha- and beta-chains may be critical for the recognition of the peptide Ag presented by the specific MHC molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have peculiar membrane phenotype and functional properties. In an effort to unravel possible molecular determinants associated with the reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that infiltrate tumors, we have investigated the expression of immediate-early genes in TAM from murine sarcomas. c-fos is a prototypic immediate oncogene, with transregulatory function on gene transcription, expressed by myelomonocytic cells and induced by certain activation signals. TAM from three murine sarcomas expressed basal levels of c-fos transcripts considerably higher than those of peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM). Activation of myelomonocytic cells by bacterial LPS is associated with an early transient increase in c-fos transcription. Unlike PEM, TAM did not show any increase in c-fos expression after exposure to LPS. A similar unresponsiveness to LPS stimulation was observed in macrophages isolated from peritoneal ascitic tumors. c-fos expression in macrophages can be induced via protein kinase C activation or via an increase in cAMP levels. Unlike PEM, TAM did not respond to the protein kinase C activator PMA and to cholera toxin. After culture for 18 to 20 h, c-fos expression in TAM declined, and concomitantly, TAM completely recovered responsiveness to LPS in terms of augmented oncogene mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that TAM from murine sarcomas have an altered expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene, with high basal levels and unresponsiveness to augmenting signals, reversible upon in vitro culture. The altered c-fos expression in TAM may reflect exposure to cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment and may underlie at least some of the peculiar properties of TAM.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage (M phi) activation is deficient in the fetus and neonate, at times when the serum concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n3) is approximately 10-fold higher than in the adult. We tested the effects of highly purified DHA on M phi activation in vitro. M phi were stimulated with rIFN-gamma plus either of two second or \"triggering\" signals, LPS or heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes. M phi activation was assayed as the lysis of P815 mastocytoma cells, which are resistant to TNF-alpha. DNA inhibited the activation of peritoneal M phi and the M phi line RAW264.7 in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations between 20 and 160 microM. These concentrations are found in fetal and neonatal rodent sera. Another polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid (20:4n6), was much less inhibitory. In contrast to its profound effect on tumoricidal activation, DHA did not inhibit phagocytosis and catabolism of 125I-heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes. Increasing the rIFN-gamma or second signals reduced the inhibition of tumoricidal activation by DHA but not M phi incorporation of 14C-DHA. When the rIFN-gamma and second signals were separated in time, DHA was far more inhibitory if delivered with the triggering signal than if delivered with the rIFN-gamma. However, the incorporation of 14C-DHA was the same under these two conditions. In M phi treated with DHA during LPS stimulation, the inhibition was time-dependent, requiring more than 2 h. Although DHA inhibits cyclooxygenase activity, its inhibition of M phi activation was not reversed with the following cyclooxygenase products: PGE2, a stable TXA2 analog (U-46, 619) or a stable PGI2 analog (Iloprost). Although DHA is metabolized by lipoxygenases, the inhibition was not reversed by the lipoxygenase inhibitors 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Altogether, the data indicate that DHA, at concentrations present in fetal and neonatal sera, inhibits M phi activation and may contribute to the previously observed deficits in M phi function in the fetus and neonate.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have subdivided the Th cells into mutually exclusive Th1 subset producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma and Th2 cells producing IL-4 and IL-5. The relative role played by these two subsets in the antitumor immunity is not clear. We earlier demonstrated that treatment of C57BL/6 mice bearing a syngeneic Ia- T cell lymphoma, LSA, with 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) resulted in 90 to 100% survival of the mice. Furthermore, host's T cell responses were critical for successful BCNU-mediated cures. In our study we observed that immediately after BCNU treatment, there was a dramatic increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells at the site of tumor growth in the peritoneal cavity. The percentage of CD4+ T cells increased from approximately 3 to 4% found in normal or tumor-bearing mice to approximately 41% in BCNU-treated tumor-bearing mice. The percentage of CD8+ T cells also increased although to a lesser degree. Also, these alterations were primarily restricted to the site of tumor-growth inasmuch as they were not seen in the thymus and were less pronounced in the spleen. The tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells obtained after BCNU-treatment, when further characterized, were found to secrete only IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not IL-4, after tumor-specific stimulation. Furthermore, the supernatants from LSA-activated CD4+ T cell cultures failed to provide help to the B cells but were able to activate the macrophages to inhibit the tumor cell proliferation. The CD4+ T cells when adoptively transferred could also protect the nude mice from LSA tumor challenge and induced tumor-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Together our data suggest that in the LSA tumor model, the tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells have the properties of Th1 cells and these cells can mediate tumor-rejection independent of the CD8+ T cells by activating the macrophages.\r"

Homotypic and heterotypic conjugate formation between leukocytes and between leukocytes and target cells via the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction has been demonstrated to be a critical event in numerous immunologic and inflammatory processes. While LFA-1 is expressed by all leukocytes, ICAM-1 is not normally expressed by all tissues with which leukocytes interact, but ICAM-1 may be induced de novo by various cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced expression and function of ICAM-1 in human keratinocytes (HK) and A-431 cells in culture has been analyzed. While A-431 cells constitutively express ICAM-1 when assessed by northern blotting, by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation, and by flow cytometry, HK do not. When these two cell types are exposed to recombinant human (rh-) IFN-gamma at 1000 U/ml for 24 h, A-431 cells upregulate ICAM-1 and HK express ICAM-1 to an equal degree when assessed by these same parameters. Furthermore, in an in vitro adhesion assay, rh-IFN-gamma treatment of the HK or A-431 cells greatly increases the specific adherence of radiolabeled T cells to these cells. These data provide further evidence for the potential role of the regulated expression of ICAM-1 by keratinocytes in immunologic and inflammatory responses occurring in the skin.\r"

  ".W": "The epidermis of all strains of normal mice is populated by two distinct dendritic, bone marrow-derived cells: Langerhans cells and CD4-CD8- Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC). The overwhelming majority of DETC are an unusually homogeneous population of thymic-dependent cells which express CD3-associated T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) of the gamma/delta type, thereby distinguishing them from conventional CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing CD3-associated alpha/beta TCR. Most DETC are ontogenetically primitive, derived from early fetal thymocytes with a preferential, but poorly understood tropism for the epidermis. Like the TCR on other populations of gamma/delta cells, which preferentially populate other epithelia such as in the gut and lung, the TCR on most DETC selectively utilize particular variable (V) gene segments (i.e., V gamma 3 and V delta 1 for DETC vs V gamma 5 and V delta 4 or V delta 6 for intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes). However, unlike other gamma/delta populations whose TCR junctional regions exhibit marked heterogeneity, DETC junctional diversity is extremely limited. This lack of TCR heterogeneity among DETC suggests they recognize a narrow range of physiologic ligands (antigens) and that this recognition is restricted not by conventional polymorphic class-I or class-II MHC molecules, but rather by relatively nonpolymorphic self MHC-like molecules of the class Ib MHC type [e.g., Qa, TL, and CD1 (T6)]. Additional studies are required to clarify precisely what DETC recognize, their relevant biological functions, as well as their relationship(s) to the gamma/delta cells recently identified in human skin.\r"

This study examined the relationship between arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and ETCO2 during the preoperative period in 20 premedicated patients undergoing various surgical procedures. ETCO2 was sampled from a 16-gauge intravenous catheter pierced through one of the two nasal oxygen prongs and measured at various oxygen flow rates (2, 4, and 6 L/min) by an on-line ETCO2 monitor with analog display. Both peak and time-averaged values for ETCO2 were recorded. The results showed that the peak ETCO2 values (mean = 38.8 mm Hg) correlated more closely with the PaCO2 values (mean = 38.8 mm Hg; correlation coefficient r = 0.76) than did the average ETCO2 values irrespective of the oxygen flow rates. The time-averaged PaCO2-ETCO2 difference was significantly greater than the PaCO2-peak ETCO2 difference (P less than 0.001). Values for subgroups within the patient population were also analyzed, and it was shown that patients with minute respiratory rates greater than 20 but less than 30 and patients age 65 years or older did not differ from the overall studied patient population with regard to PaCO2-ETCO2 difference. A small subset of patients with respiratory rates of 30/min or greater (n = 30) did show a significant increase in the PaCO2-ETCO2 difference (P less than 0.001). It was concluded that under the conditions of this study, peak ETCO2 values did correlate with PaCO2 values and were not significantly affected by oxygen flow rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscle cells at the branching points, however, showed a variety of shapes, sizes, and arrangements. As the vessel size decreased, smooth-muscle cells showed bi- or trifurcations at the cell poles. In the precapillary arterioles, smooth-muscle cells which had helically surrounded the endothelial tubes had bulging cell bodies with various cytoplasmic processes extending from the cell poles. Distinct specializations presumed to be sphincters were not found on the arteries or arterioles. Pericytes of the capillary had become extended along the vessel axis, having fusiform cell bodies with longitudinally oriented long cytoplasmic processes. Cells located periendothelially in the venules and veins were stellate in shape with many cytoplasmic processes which were interwoven to form complicated cellular networks around the endothelial tube.\r"

After weaning (21 d), normal and undernourished rats were fed a 25% protein diet until 90-120 d of age. Previously we observed that undernutrition during suckling decreases the levels of phosphoryl serine in nuclear proteins from the whole brain of adult rats. In this paper we report more specifically on the effect of undernutrition during this period on the levels of phosphoryl serine in nuclear and synaptosomal proteins from the cerebral cortex of young and nutritionally rehabilitated adult rats. In young, undernourished rats the levels of phosphoryl serine in nuclear proteins were significantly lower (28%) than those in control animals. This alteration persisted in nutritionally rehabilitated adult rats. Serine and protein levels in cerebral cortex were the same in all groups. No alteration in the levels of phosphoryl serine in the synaptosomal fraction was observed.\r"

Rates of envelope shedding, as determined by thermal stability, did not differ between HIV-1 and HIV-2; however, Scatchard plot analysis of radiolabeled virus binding revealed that fewer HIV-2 virions were bound to CD4+ cells under saturating conditions. The HIV-2 viruses also possessed consistently greater infectivity, whereas greater concentrations of gp120 were found in supernatants of HIV-1-infected cells and in HIV-2 virus pellets, suggesting that more envelope glycoprotein remains associated with HIV-2 virions.

HIV infection was assessed by commercial ELISA, Western blots, synthetic peptide ELISA, and measurement of p24 antigen. Serum immunoglobulins, lymphocyte mitogen responses, and CD4+ cell numbers were obtained in 54 sequential patients. Compared to seronegative subjects, mean CD4+ cell numbers were decreased and serum immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG, were increased in all groups of seropositive subjects. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A decreased progressively in ASX, PGL, and ARC patients and were significantly lower in PGL and ARC patients compared to seronegative controls. Generalized lymphadenopathy was present in 234/265 (88%) of patients. Lymph node biopsies in 100 patients demonstrated follicular hyperplasia in 97 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 3. Of 165 patients followed for a median of 6 months, 5 developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Symptoms of ARC, low CD4+ cell number, and p24 antigen were predictive of the development of AIDS in Zimbabwe.\r"

The use of NPs was associated with a decrease in average length of stay for the seriously injured patients from 8.10 to 7.05 days while the length of stay for other patients in the hospital remained unchanged. Documentation of quality of care in the medical record increased substantially. For example, discharge summaries that were dictated by the NPs were judged complete in all aspects in at least 95% of sampled records compared with approximately 75% of records that were dictated by the residents. With introduction of the NPs, outpatient clinic waiting times decreased from 41 to 19 minutes. Patient complaints regarding the trauma team decreased from 16 to seven/year. Time saved for the housestaff averaged 352 minutes/day while the NPs were on duty. The NPs were well received by the hospital nurses, hospital quality assurance personnel, and ancillary services. They have proved to be of great value to the patients, the patients' families, the hospital, and the trauma team.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred fifty-six triple-lumen central venous catheters placed into 65 different sites in 52 surgical or trauma patients were prospectively evaluated to determine the frequency of catheter-related infection and the efficacy of multiple guidewire exchanges. Thirty-four anatomic sites in 33 patients without clinical signs of sepsis were compared to 31 anatomic sites in 19 patients with a clinical diagnosis of sepsis based on clinical, microbiologic, and radiologic evaluation. Anatomic sites were used indefinitely unless a positive semiquantitative catheter culture (greater than or equal to 15 cfu) or catheter-associated bacteremia developed. Seven catheter-related infections developed in five septic patients (26.3%) while no infections developed in the nonseptic group (p = 0.004). Three of 31 anatomic sites (9.6%) were associated with bacteremia. The number of hospital days to initial catheter insertion and the length of catheter site use were considerably higher in the septic patients compared to the nonseptic group. We conclude that triple-lumen catheter-related infections are uncommon in patients with no evidence of infection and can be safely guidewire-exchanged to prolong site use. Catheter-related infections in septic patients are much more frequent and unpredictable. Although guidewire exchange has a role in septic patients, multiple exchanges cannot routinely be recommended.\r"

In this study ten filters were assessed through variable sample sizes over a 1-year period for cost and efficiency. Each filtered case was screened by trauma nurse coordinators. The trauma director reviewed possible deviations from standard and presented cases at peer review conferences for consensus on problem identification. While several filters had reasonable yield, most filters had minimal or no yield. Ten de novo problems were identified at a cost of +1,000 per de novo problem. Six filters were modified based on common reasons for overfiltration, resulting in a substantial reduction in filtration rate without losing problem identification. We conclude that ACSCOT audit filters 1 (unexpected deaths), 4 (ICU LOS greater than twice the average), 5 (trauma surgeon response), and 9 (major surgery greater than 24 hours) have a reasonable yield. Filters 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12 have limited value to an established suburban trauma center and are not cost effective. Modifications of these filters can reduce cost without obvious impact on effectiveness. Specific audit filters recommended for future study are presented.\r"

As nutritional efforts cannot reduce these losses sufficiently, an adjunctive therapy using the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate (Nd) was applied. In a double-blind study 10 male multiple-traumatized patients each received 50 mg of Nd on day 3 and 25 mg of Nd on day 6 after the trauma, an additional 10 patients received placebo only. Both groups had identical nutritional support. Nitrogen balance, total nitrogen excretion as well as plasma amino acid concentration, and urine amino acid excretion were measured daily. The anabolic agent improved the nitrogen balance mainly by reducing nitrogen excretion. 3-Methylhistidine excretion and renal amino acid losses were decreased. Nandrolone decanoate increased the concentration of total plasma amino acids. The underlying principle seems to be an amino acid-saving mechanism with a renal site of action. It is shown that in the early posttraumatic period nandrolone decanoate improves nitrogen metabolism. Further studies are required to determine whether this offers a clinical benefit to trauma patients.\r"

By multiple regression analysis we found that the measured EE (MEE) is best approximated by the following formula: -4343 + (10.5 x %TBSA) + (0.23 x CI) + (0.84 x EBEE) + (114 x Temp (degree C)) - (4.5 x PBD), r = 0.82, p less than 0.001, (Toronto formula (TF)). To validate this, 10 patients with a mean TBSA of 49.1 +/- 5.5% had their resting MEE done by indirect calorimetry when fed either by the TF or by 2 x EBEE. The caloric intake when on 2 x EBEE was 3260 +/- 45 kcal/day which significantly exceeded the MEE (2765 +/- 101 kcal/day, p less than 0.001). The caloric intake when on the TF was 2542 +/- 52 kcal/day and matches the MEE which was 2537 +/- 86 kcal/day (NS). These results show that the TF matches the MEE very closely. With the addition of a factor of activity for the 24-hr EE, it can be used to accurately feed individual burn patients.\r"

The acivicin treatment or combination of acivicin with TPN produced increased carcass weights and decreased tumor/carcass ratios. Significant muscle saving was observed in TB rats receiving TPN or TPN and acivicin as compared to acivicin-treated TB rats maintained on rat chow. Tumor growth was not stimulated by TPN at 130% of ad libitum. intake with a calorie/nitrogen ratio of 102:1. However, when the calorie/nitrogen ratio was increased to 143:1, tumor growth was increased by TPN at 120% of ad libitum. intake. These results suggest that acivicin may prove useful in the stabilization of tumors in situations where tumor growth may be stimulated, such as during TPN.\r"

In study 1, 50 rats underwent cecal ligation/perforation and subsequent infusion for 24 hr with one of four isocaloric (220 kcal/kg/day), isonitrogenous (1.4 g/N/kg/day), isovolemic regimens which differed in caloric source: Glucose (GLU) + long-chain triglycerides (LCT) (50%:50%), GLU + LCT + medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) (50%:32%:18%), GLU + LCT/Carnitine (10 mg/dl) or GLU + LCT + Xylitol (XYL) (33%:33%:33%). The nitrogen-sparing effect of GLU + LCT was not enhanced by the addition of carnitine to facilitate LCT mitochondrial uptake or by MCT to bypass carnitine-dependent transport. In contrast, relative to GLU + LCT GLU + LCT + XYL decreased urinary 3-methylhistidine (3MH) excretion (p less than 0.01), and enhanced nitrogen retention (p less than 0.01 vs GLU + LCT). For study 2, 24 male rats were anesthetized, cannulated for TPN, and given a 25% burn. They were then randomized into three dietary groups. The diets were isocaloric (103 kcal/kg/day) and isonitrogenous (2.0 g N/kg/day) but differed in nonprotein calorie source: GLU + LCT (51%:49%), GLU + Glycerol (51%:49%) and XYL + LCT (51%:49%). As in the septic animals, N balance was best with the xylitol regimen (p less than 0.01). The polyol, xylitol, appears to have a significant nitrogen sparing effect in stressed animals.\r"

Four patients had spinal osteoporosis on radiograms. The density of various bone components at the wrist was measured noninvasively using a novel technique based on Compton scattering effect. The density of the cancellous and cortical bone was decreased in nine and six patients, respectively. During a follow-up period of up to 19 months, a further significant decrease in the density of both bone components was found. We conclude that prolonged HTPN is associated with an ongoing bone diminution, affecting mainly the cancellous bone.\r"

Of 81 organisms isolated from the blood, 59% were Gram-positive cocci, 25% were Gram-negative bacilli, and 16% were yeast. Attempts to treat bacterial infections at home with antibiotic therapy while the catheter remained in place were made; fungal isolation resulted in immediate hospitalization and catheter removal. Gram-negative infections more often resulted in eventual hospitalization (92%) and catheter removal (50%) than Gram-positive infections (57% hospitalization and 23% catheter removal). Empiric therapy with 1 g of cefazolin intravenously every 12 hr was successful in only 33% of episodes caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas vancomycin was successful in 62%. Sensitivity testing was not a reliable guide for antibiotic choice for treatment of these infections. Cefazolin, 1 g, intravenously every 12 hr was successful in only 25% of Gram-negative episodes treated empirically with this regimen. We conclude that our home parenteral nutrition patients should be hospitalized for a few days upon presentation with a catheter infection for clinical evaluation and aggressive antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin is the preferred drug for treatment of catheter-related infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus.\r"

There was a total of 82 episodes of proven catheter-related sepsis, an average of 1.5 septic episodes per patient year. In about half of these instances, the catheter had to be removed. Coagulase-negative and -positive staphylococci were the most common organisms isolated. All four Candida infections led to removal of the catheter. Children requiring HPN from early infancy had a higher frequency of catheter-related infections than those started on HPN after the first year of life. In four cases, clinically significant thrombotic complications occurred. The results suggest that even under optimal conditions of catheter placement and with extensive education in aseptic catheter handling, infection is still relatively common in children receiving HPN. However, there was no mortality related to this complication.\r"

The majority of complications involve mechanical problems associated with insertion. Although cardiac arrhythmia has been acknowledged as a possible complication, its incidence has never been quantified. We performed cardiac monitoring on patients during 51 central venous catheter insertions or exchanges to determine the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias during guidewire insertion. Forty-one percent of procedures resulted in atrial arrhythmias and 25% produced some degree of ventricular ectopy, 30% of these were ventricular couplets or greater. Ventricular ectopy was significantly more common in shorter patients (160 +/- 8 vs 168 +/- 11 cm, p less than 0.05) and when the catheter was inserted from the right subclavian position (43% ventricular ectopy vs 10% at the other sites). Other variables such as age, cardiac history, serum potassium, type of procedure, and catheter brand were not significant. It is our conclusion that over-insertion of the wire causes this cardiac stimulation. Despite the absence of morbidity or mortality in this study, this incidence of ventricular ectopy indicates that there is a distinct possibility of a malignant arrhythmia being precipitated by a guidewire. Some modification of the current protocol for these procedures seems indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Medium-chain dicarboxylic acids (MCDA) are usually considered byproducts of beta-oxidation when omega-oxidizable medium-chain monocarboxylic acids are accumulated, as in beta-oxidation impairment. However, evidence exists of a mitochondrial and cytoplasmatic peroxisomal carnitine independent beta-oxidation of these diacids. Our purpose was to evaluate whether MCDA could be used as source of calories. The metabolic response to intravenous administration of azelaic acid (AA) vs Intralipid (IL) was evaluated in six healthy overnight fasting male volunteers who received an infusion of 10 g of AA over 80 min and as a control 10 g of IL. AA reached a peak concentration at 80 min, (589 +/- 61 micrograms/ml) and was rapidly cleared from plasma (82 +/- 5 micrograms/ml at 240 min). Respiratory and metabolic parameters were evaluated by indirect calorimetry from the beginning of the infusion for 240 min. In both groups the CO2 production (VCO2) remained unchanged with no significant change from basal values. The O2 consumption (VO2 ml/min/m2) increased over basal values reaching a peak at the end of the infusion in both groups (AA from 119.4 +/- 16.9 to 143.0 +/- 27.6; IL from 124.7 +/- 16.8 to 152.3 +/- 29.5). Respiratory quotient (RQ) consequently decreased significantly (AA from 0.85 +/- 0.06 to 0.76 +/- 0.06; IL from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to 0.78 +/- 0.03) and calories derived from lipids increased. Metabolic rate (MR kcal/hr/m2) showed a slight increase (AA from 34.0 +/- 4.4 to 40.3 +/- 6.8; IL from 35.9 +/- 5.1 to 41.3 +/- 10.5).

The nutrient formula consisted of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid modules sterilized separately, in an autoclave at 120 degrees C, then mixed and supplemented with minerals and trace elements. Vitamins were given the patients through a feeding tube before connecting the nutrient container. The system was used to feed 12 malnourished patients (10 men and two women) with cancer (carcinoma of esophagus or tongue) or without cancer (esophageal perforation). All patients had normal gastrointestinal function but could not take in more than 500 kcal/day orally, because of their primary disease or the treatment for it (surgery in four patients; and radiotherapy, associated in some cases with chemotherapy, in eight). HEN duration ranged from 30 to 435 days at a daily cost of approximately US $15 to $20. Statistical analysis (Student's t-test for paired data) showed significant body weight gain (p less than 0.05) and significant increases in serum levels of albumin, transthyretin (p less than 0.05, respectively), and transferrin (p less than 0.01). Increases of serum total protein level were not statistically significant (p less than 0.09). The nutrient formula was well tolerated and there were no HEN-related rehospitalizations. Seventy-five % (nine of the patients) considered that HEN had improved their quality of life. The daily savings per patient, compared to the cost of treatment in a hospital, was about $260/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cysteine is usually not included in amino acid solutions for intravenous nutrition for two reasons: it is not considered to be an essential amino acid, and it causes stability problems in solutions. The cysteine content of a solution decreases markedly in the presence of oxygen and/or glucose due to formation of various derivatives, such as cystine and D-glucocysteine. It is not clear if the formed derivatives are available for metabolic processes. A cysteine analogue, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTCA), is stable in solutions and can be metabolized in the body-yielding cysteine. The metabolic availability of cysteine and OTCA from an all-in-one total parenteral nutrition (TPN) mixture was evaluated in the rat and compared to a regimen with cysteine infused from a separate container. A cysteine-free TPN mixture served as a control. All mixtures contained a suboptimal amount of methionine, which can normally be metabolized to cysteine, to enhance the nutritional effect of cysteine or OTCA supplement. The cysteine content in the admixture decreased approximately 40% during 30 hr after mixing. Nevertheless the utilization of this admixture was identical to the regimen supplying cysteine separately. The admixture containing OTCA showed similar results as the two cysteine regimens. All three regimens promoted growth significantly better than the cysteine-free-mixture. The results suggest that 1) cysteine is available for metabolic processes from its derivatives formed in an all-in-one TPN mixture, and 2) OTCA acts as a precursor of cysteine to the rat when supplied as a part of TPN.\r"

A Drum cartridge catheter was inserted into the occluded feeding tube to displace any liquid formula and to apply the enzyme solution close to the obstruction site. Water was injected first and served as control. The feeding tubes of 32 patients occluded 60 times during an 8-month period and declogging was attempted in 44 instances. Water was able to clear the obstruction in 12 cases. In the remaining 32 cases, the activated pancreatic enzyme was injected, and the obstruction was cleared in 23 cases (72%). The causes of failure to clear the obstruction were determined in seven cases: tablet impaction (three cases), knotted feeding tube (two cases), tomato seed occluded the feeding port (one case), formula clot in two-third length of the tube for 24-hr (one case). Thus, the pancreatic enzyme solution was successful in restoring tube patency in 23 of 24 instances (96%) where formula clotting was the likely cause of occlusion and Coke or water had failed.\r"

There are interesting experimental data supporting a role for fiber in artificial enteral feeding: NSP components have been shown to increase fecal bacterial mass, to favor colonic sodium and water absorption, to stimulate colonic crypt proliferation and to delay small intestinal glucose absorption. The number of controlled studies testing the effects of fiber added to liquid formulas is, however, small. Thus, there is no firm basis for the routine use of fiber-enriched formulas although these products are commercially available and in widespread clinical use. Research in this important field of digestive physiology is encouraged as many experimental data are in favor of supplementing formula diets with fiber.\r"

  ".U": "90279116\r", 
  ".W": "Acid maltase deficiency in adults is associated with progressive muscle weakness and may effect respiratory muscles resulting in respiratory failure. The biochemical and clinical manifestations of acid maltase deficiency arise from a marked deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase), which normally degrades glycogen to free glucose. In the past few years, high-protein diets have provided an alternative energy source for these patients and resulted in improved muscle strength. Recently, we treated a ventilator-dependent acid maltase-deficient patient with a general diet supplemented with branched-chain amino acids. Branched-chain amino acids are the principal amino acids involved in muscle protein synthesis and utilization. While on this diet, the patient had improvement of respiratory function and muscle strength and was able to be weaned from the ventilator during the day. In addition to his nutritional status, levels of serum branched-chain amino acids, showed improvement within 2 months after the diet started. This diet shows potential advantages over a high-protein diet without supplemented branched-chain amino acids for the treatment of acid maltase deficiency. These include theoretical sparing of amino acids required for muscle protein synthesis by providing higher concentrations of postprandial branched-chain amino acids in the circulation. Also, the liquid formula would be better tolerated by a ventilator-dependent or debilitated patient rather than a high-protein general diet. Further experience with branched-chain amino acid formulas will be needed to substantiate their efficacy in the treatment of acid maltase deficiency.\r"

Fifty patients, 3 to 76 years of age with burns ranging from 10 to 89% total body surface area were prospectively randomized into three groups which blindly compared MTF to two enteral regimens widely utilized in the nutritional support of burns. Age, percent total and third-degree burn, resting energy expenditure, and calorie and protein intake were similar in all groups. Data analysis demonstrated significant superiority of MTF in the reduction of wound infection (p less than 0.03) and length of stay/percent burn (p less than 0.02). MTF was also associated with a decreased incidence of diarrhea, improved glucose tolerance, lower serum triglycerides, reduced total number of infectious episodes and trends toward improved preservation of muscle mass, although statistical significance was not achieved. Seventy percent of deaths occurred in the group supported with an inherently large dose of fat and linoleic acid. Combining these observations, it is believed that MTF is effective in modulating an improved response to burn injury.\r"

Serum albumin and C3 were lower in all experimental groups than normal controls (ANOVA: p = 0.01). Comparison of liver, spleen, adrenals, gastrocnemius, and carcass weights, cell-mediated immunity as determined by contact sensitivity to DNFB, and transferrin showed no significant differences. There was a positive dose-response effect seen amongst the experimental groups for the amino acids arginine, ornithine, and citrulline in relation to the amount of supplemental arginine. This study suggests that dietary arginine supplementation does not enhance survival in a guinea pig model of established peritonitis.\r"

Ketone bodies and glucose were compared in a dose dependent manner as nonprotein fuels for support of resected colon. Rats had their descending colons resected and received all nutrients by vein for 5 days postoperation. Colonic healing was evaluated from the air pressure required to break the wound. All rats received constant nutrients except for non-protein energy which was fed at 10.5, 21, 31.5, and 42 kcal/day using either glucose or monoacetoacetin as substrate. Colonic bursting pressure was measured on day 5 after surgery. When energy intake was 21 kcal/day or greater, the bursting pressure was two-thirds of nonwounded tissue and was independent of energy quantity and source. At 10.5 kcal/day, bursting pressure for glucose-fed animals was similar to that for animals with no added nonprotein energy while, in contrast, bursting pressure for animals fed monoacetoacetin was similar to that for animals fed 42 kcal/day. It was concluded that bursting pressure was influenced by dietary intake only if the energy intake was sufficiently low, and then ketone bodies were better than glucose for support of colonic healing.\r"

Mean plasma carnitine was significantly below the mean normal for females (p less than 0.02) and borderline low for males (p = 0.07). In six patients the levels were below the low normal range, and in five others they were at the lowest levels of normal. Of the six patients with normal levels, three had elevated serum creatinine, indicating renal dysfunction which may by itself elevate plasma carnitine. In 10 patients the plasma levels of lysine (a carnitine precursor) were determined and found to be lower than normal (p less than 0.05). Plasma carnitine levels correlated positively with serum albumin (r = 0.62, p less than 0.05), and negatively with serum alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05). Thus, patients maintained on long-term TPN may have low plasma carnitine, which could represent carnitine deficiency. The low plasma carnitine may be related to a deficiency of the carnitine precursor lysine. Further studies are required to determine the significance of the low plasma carnitine and whether carnitine supplementation should be required in long-term TPN.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the recovery of human insulin from standard TPN solutions with and without lipids and from TPN solutions with specialized amino acid formulations and to compare it to the insulin recovery from normal saline. All solutions were mixed in currently utilized PVC-free bags (ethylene vinyl acetate) and drained through PVC-containing tubing. Human insulin (Humulin-R) was spiked with 125I-labeled insulin and then added in concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 units to 1-liter bags containing 39-g amino acids (10% Freamine-III; or 6.9% Freamine HBC; or 8% Hepatamine), 257-g dextrose, electrolytes (Hyperlyte-R), 1000 units of heparin, MVI-12, and MTE-5 Concentrate. Alternate sets of bags contained 125 ml of 20% Intralipid and an appropriate amount of sterile water to keep the final volume at 1 liter. Actual clinical conditions of preparation, storage, and administration were simulated in this in vitro experiment. Multiple samples were collected during the 8-hr infusion period directly in gamma counter vials. All experiments and assays were done in triplicate. Our findings indicate that human insulin availability in TPN solutions is much higher (90%-95%) than the 50% suggested in the literature. Insulin recovery was not appreciably altered by adding lipids or by using Freamine HBC. Insulin recovery from TPN solutions was significantly reduced if they contained Hepatamine (87% and 88%, p less than 0.05) as compared to Freamine (90% and 94%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adequate enteral nutritional support is often limited by gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. In this pilot clinical trial we compared an enteral nutrition formula based on soy hydrolysate (study formula, SF) against a widely used intact casein formula (control formula, CF) for the incidence of GI side effects in a completely randomized double blind design. Twenty-three nonsurgical hospitalized patients requiring enteral nutritional support and free of GI symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either the CF or the SF for 6 days continuously. Both formulas were isotonic, low in residue, lactose free and isocaloric, but differed in the type and concentration of protein and the concentration of medium-chain triglycerides. After randomization both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics, and nutritional status, but there were more patients on antibiotics in the CF group. The amount of formula infused per day and the route of administration were equivalent. The number of bowel movements per day was 1.0 +/- 0.5 for the CF group and 0.6 +/- 0.3 for the SF group (p less than 0.05). The incidence of diarrhea was 10.8% days for the CF group and 6.2% for the SF group (p = NS). High gastric residuals occurred in 16.9% of days in the CF group and 3.3% in the SF group (p less than 0.05). Vomiting incidence was 10.8% in the CF group and 1.5% in the SF group (p less than 0.05). After adjustment for the use of antibiotics as a covariate, the differences in number of bowel movements, vomiting and incidence of high residuals became less significant (p less than 0.10).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Significant decreases have been reported in phenytoin absorption when the suspension is combined with continuous enteral feedings. Several theories for this interaction have been proposed including binding of phenytoin to the protein constituents of the enteral formula, phenytoin binding to the calcium in the enteral formula, and inadequate dissolution of the suspension when delivered with the enteral formula due to the high pKa of phenytoin and the acidic nature of the enteral formula. We therefore evaluated the effects of pH levels 2.0, 3.5, 6.0, and 8.0 on the interaction of phenytoin suspension with enteral formula (Osmolite) with equilibrium dialysis using a Spectra/Por 1 (MWCO 6000-8000) molecularporous dialysis membrane. Phenytoin concentrations in the dialysis membrane (internal phase) mimicked the expected stomach concentrations of a 100-mg dose administered in an adult stomach containing 200 ml of gastric fluid. External phase buffers were sampled at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 24.0 hr after the start of the dialysis. The phenytoin concentrations in the external phase were compared between buffer alone or buffer combined with enteral formula at the same pH and time intervals. With pH 2.0 and 3.5 the enteral formula formed an aggregate with suspension whereas no aggregate was formed with pH 6.0 and 8.0. The phenytoin concentrations with pH 2.0 were 26% to 44% lower and with pH 3.5 were 11.5 to 27% lower when phenytoin suspension was combined with enteral solution. However, at 24 hr there was no difference between the two conditions with both pH 2.0 and 3.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seven healthy volunteers (four males, 20-28 years) were studied to determine the effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) on ampicillin clearance. Each volunteer received intravenous infusions of 1 liter of PN (3.75% amino acid and 10% dextrose) alternating with 1 liter of 10% dextrose (containing all additives as PN except for calcium and phosphorus); and a meal containing similar fluid volume, caloric, protein, and sodium content as the PN solution. Ampicillin (250 mg) was given intravenously 2 hr after commencement of each intravenous solution and 4 hr after the meal. During PN infusion, the mean (+/- SE) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as indicated by creatinine clearance was 125 +/- 18 ml/min; ampicillin pharmacokinetic data included area under the serum ampicillin concentration-time curve of 899 +/- 118 micrograms min/ml, terminal elimination half life of 37 +/- 4.3 min, volume of distribution at steady state of 11.9 +/- 1.6 liter, total body clearance of 4.7 +/- 0.6 ml/min/kg, renal clearance of 3.8 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg, and 82 +/- 6.7% of the ampicillin administered was excreted in urine over 10 hr. The results were not significantly altered by different nutrient regimens or the order of infusion of intravenous solutions. We conclude that the use of PN is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of ampicillin provided the renal functions including GFR, remain unchanged.\r"

Since administration of nutrients parenterally results in intestinal hypoplasia and hypofunction, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of UG on intestinal structure and function in parenterally fed rats. Central venous catheters were placed into 28 Sprague-Dawley rats. Group I (n = 10) received TPN alone. Group II (n = 8) received TPN and 15 micrograms/day of UG and group III (n = 10) received rat chow ad libitum. The animals that received urogastrone had significantly greater (p less than 0.05) intestinal weight (25.6 +/- 2.5 mg/cm vs 22.6 +/- 3.0 mg/cm), mucosal weight (8.4 +/- 1.4 mg/cm vs 6.2 +/- 0.9 mg/cm), mucosal protein content (6.2 +/- 1.7 mg/cm vs 2.7 +/- 0.6 mg/cm), villous height (427 +/- 27 microns vs 293 +/- 75 microns), crypt cell production rate (14.5 +/- 1.4 metaphases/hr vs 12.3 +/- 0.7 metaphases/hr) and sucrase specific activity (6.5 +/- 2.6 vs 3.7 +/- 2.0) than animals receiving only TPN. However, these parameters remained less than in chow-fed animals. Thus, simultaneous infusion of UG prevents, in part, intestinal hypofunction and hypoplasia which occurs during TPN. This may be due to maintenance of mucosal proliferative activity and brush border enzyme activity.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups based on the method of PN administration. One group received PN by the traditional two-plus-one method where lipid emulsion is given separately from the dextrose-amino acid mixture. The second group received PN by the three-in-one method where lipid emulsion is admixed with the dextrose and amino acids. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the amount of calories, lipid, dextrose, protein, calcium, and phosphorus received per kg of body weight. Average daily weight gain was not statistically different, and no obvious trends were noted in serum biochemical parameters between the two groups. Average total PN days for the groups (13 +/- 7 days for the two-plus-one group vs 39 +/- 35 days for the three-in-one group) were significantly different (p less than 0.05). A cost comparison of the two methods of PN administration indicated that the two-plus-one method costs our hospital $11.78 more per day than the three-in-one solution. We conclude that the three-in-one method of PN administration is safe, efficacious, and cost effective for infants under 1 year of age.\r"

Parenteral nutritional solutions and medications were administered through these catheters. Twenty neonates matched for birth weight and gestational age served as paired controls. In vitro studies demonstrate that the maximum infusion rate for parenteral nutrition solutions is about 20 ml/hr. Packed red blood cells could not be infused through these catheters. In vivo results demonstrate a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in number of peripheral iv catheters inserted during study (2 +/- 1 vs 7 +/- 4, SD) with no difference in cost per day of iv access ($79.42 +/- 113.51 vs $43.91 +/- 15.99, SD). Two-dimensional ultrasound assessment of catheter thrombosis was unsuccessful. Moreover, there was no correlation between angiographic and electron microscopic evaluation of catheter tip thrombosis. Electron microscopy of catheter tips revealed 33% with complete, partial and no occlusion, respectively, and 39% with sheath thrombosis. In summary, percutaneous insertion of a 27-gauge OD Vialon central venous catheter is a feasible alternative in providing venous access in very low birth weight infants.\r"

TPN solutions consisted of 4.25% and 5% amino acids with 25% and 35% dextrose, respectively. Imipenem-cilastatin sodium was constituted with 10 ml of sterile water and admixed with 90 ml of TPN solution for a final concentration of 5 mg/ml of each drug. The final solutions were assayed at times 0 (immediately after admixture), 15 min, 30 min, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hr by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. Concurrently, test TPN solutions were monitored for pH changes, color changes, and precipitate formation. The potential effect of imipenem-cilastatin sodium on the stability of amino acids and other TPN additives was not evaluated. Imipenem and cilastatin sodium was stable (greater than or equal to 90% recovered) in each TPN solution at 15 min. A significant (greater than or equal to 10%) and steady decrease of imipenem recovery occurred at subsequent sampling times. Cilastatin appeared more stable than imipenem in both TPN solutions. A physical color change from colorless to dark orange appeared in each TPN solution over the 24-hr study period. Imipenem-cilastatin sodium is stable for 15 min in the TPN solutions studied; however, until the stability of the amino acids can be determined, the antibiotic should be administered through a separate line or Y-site while the TPN infusion is interrupted.\r"

Of 25 incidents of catheter occlusion in 142 right atrial catheters, six failed to clear after an initial bolus dwell of urokinase. Five of these six catheters cleared following treatment with 2 mg/2 cc of t-PA with a mean of 1.5 bolus installations. The one catheter failure was due to catheter tip position and age of clot. No coagulation abnormalities or bleeding was observed. These data suggest that t-PA may be a safe, effective thrombolytic agent in the treatment of occluded central venous catheters.\r"

Repeated aspiration attempts were performed every 5 to 10 min for a maximum of 30 to 60 min or patency. In the event catheter patency was not restored, the thrombolytic solution was aspirated from the catheter and a maximum of two additional trials were instituted. Results included clearance of four out of 15 withdrawal occlusions (27%) and two out of four resistance to infusion occlusions (50%). Overall, successful catheter clearance occurred in six out of 19 occlusions (32%). The efficacy rate of thrombolytic therapy for successfully clearing occluded catheters at our institution using conventional low-dose thrombolytic therapy is markedly lower than previously reported rates of 57 to 100%. The reasons for this discrepancy may reflect differences in dosage of thrombolytic agent, method of administration, frequency of monitoring of catheter patency, and catheter life.\r"

Only 1 of the 6 donations (17%) transmitted NANBH to a recipient. Hepatitis C virus RNA sequences were detected in the serum of the transmitting donor by an assay which used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and non-radioisotopic detection. No such sequences were detected in the other 5 donors positive for anti-C100. Stored serum samples from blood donors who had been involved in three episodes of post-transfusion NANBH in 1981 also contained hepatitis C viral sequences. Although the PCR assay in its present form is not suitable for mass donor screening, the presence of hepatitis C viral sequences detected by PCR in blood donations seems a better predictor of infectivity than the presence of anti-C100 alone.\r"

The genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pIP811, that was self-transferable to other L monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to Staphylococcus aureus. The efficacy of transfer and the stability of pIP811 were higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. As indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pIP811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. Plasmid pIP811 shared extensive sequence homology with pAM beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. These results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in Listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. The dissemination of resistance to other strains of L monocytogenes is likely.\r"

  ".W": "Rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) prohormone contains five copies of the TRH progenitor sequence Gln-His-Pro-Gly linked together by connecting sequences whose biological activity is unknown. Both the predicted connecting peptide prepro-TRH-(160-169) (Ps4) and TRH are predominant storage forms of TRH precursor-related peptides in the hypothalamus. To determine whether Ps4 is co-released with TRH, rat median eminence slices were perifused in vitro. Infusion of depolarizing concentrations of KCl induced stimulation of release of Ps4- and TRH-like immunoreactivity. The possible effect of Ps4 on thyrotropin release was investigated in vitro using quartered anterior pituitaries. Infusion of Ps4 alone had no effect on thyrotropin secretion but potentiated TRH-induced thyrotropin release in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the occurrence of specific binding sites for 125I-labeled Tyr-Ps4 in the distal lobe of the pituitary was demonstrated by binding analysis and autoradiographic localization. These findings indicate that these two peptides that arise from a single multifunctional precursor, the TRH prohormone, act in a coordinate manner on the same target cells to promote hormonal secretion. These data suggest that differential processing of the TRH prohormone may have the potential to modulate the biological activity of TRH.\r"

To identify additional family members, the cDNA for the human tyrosine phosphatase leukocyte common antigen (LCA; CD45) was used to screen, under low stringency, a mouse pre-B-cell cDNA library. Two cDNA clones were isolated and sequence analysis predicts a protein sequence of 793 amino acids. We have named the molecule LRP (LCA-related phosphatase). RNA transfer analysis indicates that the cDNAs were derived from a 3.2-kilobase mRNA. The LRP mRNA is transcribed in a wide variety of tissues. The predicted protein structure can be divided into the following structural features: a short 19-amino acid leader sequence, an exterior domain of 123 amino acids that is predicted to be highly glycosylated, a 24-amino acid membrane-spanning region, and a 627-amino acid cytoplasmic region. The cytoplasmic region contains two approximately 260-amino acid domains, each with homology to the tyrosine phosphatase family. One of the cDNA clones differed in that it had a 108-base-pair insertion that, while preserving the reading frame, would disrupt the first protein-tyrosine-phosphatase domain. Analysis of genomic DNA indicates that the insertion is due to an alternatively spliced exon. LRP appears to be evolutionarily conserved as a putative homologue has been identified in the invertebrate Styela plicata.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we study the effects of internal deletions of the yeast transcriptional activator HAP1 (CYP1) on activity at two dissimilar DNA binding sites, upstream activation sequence 1 (UAS1) of CYC1 (iso-1-cytochrome c) and CYC7 (iso-2-cytochrome c). These deletions remove up to 1061 amino acids of the 1483-residue protein and bring the carboxyl-terminal acidic activation domain closer to the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain. Surprisingly, the deletions have opposite effects at the two sites; activity at UAS1 increases with deletion size, while activity at CYC7 decreases. The mutant with the largest deletion, mini-HAP1, has no measurable activity at CYC7 but binds normally to the site in vitro. In contrast, a protein with the DNA-binding domain of HAP1 fused to the acidic activation domain of GAL4 is active at both UAS1 and CYC7. These findings are discussed in the context of two models that suggest how the DNA sequence can alter the activity of the bound HAP1. In a separate experiment, we generate a mutation in the DNA-binding domain of HAP1 that requires the addition of zinc for binding to either UAS1 or CYC7 in vitro. This finding shows that a zinc finger anchors DNA binding to both types of HAP1 sites.\r"

  ".W": "Tryptic digestion of pig renal Na/K-ATPase in the presence of Rb and absence of Ca ions removes about half of the protein but leaves a stable 19-kDa membrane-embedded fragment derived from the alpha chain, a largely intact beta chain, and essentially normal Rb- and Na-occlusion capacity. Subsequent digestion with trypsin in the presence of Ca or absence of Rb ions leads to rapid loss of the 19-kDa fragment and a parallel loss of Rb occlusion, demonstrating that the fragment is essential for occlusion. The N-terminal sequence of the 19-kDa fragment is Asn-Pro-Lys-Thr-Asp-Lys-Leu-Val-Asn-Glu-Arg-Leu-Ile-Ser-Met-Ala, beginning at residue 830 and extending toward the C terminus. Membranes containing the 19-kDa fragment have the following functional properties. (i) ATP-dependent functions are absent. (ii) The apparent affinity for occluding Rb is unchanged, the affinity for Na is lower than in the control enzyme, and activation is now strongly sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic. (iii) Membranes containing the 19-kDa fragment can be reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and sustain slow Rb-Rb exchange. Thus the transport pathway is retained. We conclude that cation occlusion sites and the transport pathway within transmembrane segments are quite separate from the ATP binding site, located on the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha chain. Interactions between cation and ATP sites, the heart of active transport, must be indirect--mediated, presumably, by conformational changes of the protein.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a \"domain.\" Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.\r"

DNase I footprinting reveals additional cis-acting elements (I gamma 2 and I gamma 3) that contain sequence similarities to NF-kappa B and/or H2TF1/KBF1 recognition sequences. A series of fusion constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene were used to analyze the role of these sequences (I gamma 1, I gamma 2, I gamma 3, and X and Y elements) in both normal and mutant B lymphocytes. These data suggest the likelihood of multiple X box proteins in B cells, which can act as both negative and positive regulatory factors.\r"

We now report that LLC-PK1 cells contain two members of the alpha i protein family, alpha i-2 and alpha i-3, which have distinct cellular locations consistent with their diverse functional roles. By using specific alpha i antibodies and immunofluorescence, the alpha i-2 subunit was found to be localized to the basolateral membrane, whereas the alpha i-3 subunit was concentrated in the Golgi and was also detectable at low levels on apical membranes in some cells. Induction of a chimeric mouse metallothionein 1-rat or canine alpha i-2 gene stably transfected into the LLC-PK1 cells produced an increase in the content of the alpha i-2 subunit, which was targeted only to the basolateral membrane. These findings suggest that alpha i subunit specificity for effectors may be achieved in polarized renal epithelial cells by their geographic segregation to different cellular membranes. The LLC-PK1 cell stably transfected with the metallothionein-alpha i-2 fusion gene will provide a model for the study of guanine nucleotide regulatory protein function in epithelia.\r"

We have analyzed how this UGA \"sense codon\" is discriminated from a UGA codon signaling polypeptide chain termination. Deletions were introduced from the 3' side into the fdhF gene and the truncated 5' segments were fused in-frame to the lacZ reporter gene. Efficient read-through of the UGA codon, as measured by beta-galactosidase activity and incorporation of selenium, was dependent on the presence of at least 40 bases of fdhF mRNA downstream of the UGA codon. There was excellent correlation between the results of the deletion studies and the existence of a putative stem-loop structure lying immediately downstream of the UGA in that deletions extending into the helix drastically reduced UGA translation. Similar secondary structures can be formed in the mRNAs coding for other selenoproteins. Selenocysteine insertion cartridges were synthesized that contained this hairpin structure and variable portions of the fdhF gene upstream of the UGA codon and inserted into the lacZ gene. Expression studies showed that upstream sequences were not required for selenocysteine insertion but that they may be involved in modulating the efficiency of read-through. Translation of the UGA codon was found to occur with high fidelity since it was refractory to ribosomal mutations affecting proofreading and to suppression by the sup-9 gene product.\r"

It was proposed that these two proteins constitute a membrane-bound translocator for hemolysin [Mackman, N., Nicaud, J. M., Gray, L. & Holland, I. B. (1986) Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 125, 159-181]. We show here that an E. coli outer membrane protein, the TolC protein, encoded by a gene not located in the hly cluster, is specifically required for hemolysin secretion.

As yet, there has been no extensive mapping of these functions to the fine structure of human class II molecules. To determine sites on the HLA-DR3 molecule involved in antigen presentation to T cells, we used monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-DR3 to immunoselect mutants of a B-lymphoblastoid line. We located the sites of single amino acid substitutions in the HLA-DR3 molecule and correlated these structural changes with patterns of recognition by HLA-DR3-restricted, antigen-specific T cells, allospecific T cells, and allospecific anti-DR3 monoclonal antibodies. We analyzed seven mutations. One mutation, at position 74 in domain 1 of the DR beta chain, affected recognition by all T cells tested, whereas others, at positions 9, 45, 73, 151, and 204 of the DR beta chain and position 115 of the DR alpha chain, altered recognition by some T cells, but not others. Each of the substitutions resulted in a unique pattern of T-cell stimulation. In addition, each T-cell clone recognized a different subset of the mutants. These results indicate that different residues of the DR3 molecule are involved in presentation of antigen to different DR3-restricted T cells. These studies further show that substitutions which most likely affect peptide binding alter recognition of DR3 molecules by an alloreactive T-cell clone and some allospecific antibodies.\r"

The expressed P450s were analyzed for their abilities to activate the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 to metabolites having mutagenic or DNA-binding properties. Five forms, P450s IA2, IIA3, IIB7, IIIA3, and IIIA4, activated aflatoxin B1 to mutagenic metabolites as assessed by the production of His revertants of Salmonella typhimurium in the Ames test. The same P450s catalyzed conversion of aflatoxin B1 to DNA-bound derivatives as judged by an in situ assay in which the radiolabeled carcinogen was incubated with cells expressing the individual P450 forms. Seven other human P450s, IIC8, IIC9, IID6, IIE1, IIF1, IIIA5, and IVB1, did not significantly activate aflatoxin B1 as measured by both the Ames test and the DNA-binding assay. Moreover, polyclonal anti-rat liver P450 antibodies that crossreact with individual human P450s IA2, IIA3, IIIA3, and IIIA4 each inhibited aflatoxin B1 activation catalyzed by human liver S-9 extracts. Inhibition ranged from as low as 10% with antibody against IIA3 to as high as 65% with antibody against IIIA3 and IIIA4. These results establish that metabolic activation of aflatoxin B1 in human liver involves the contribution of multiple forms of P450.\r"

The mechanisms for other pigmentation determinants (e.g., those operative in tyrosinase-positive albinism and in murine coat-color mutants) are not yet known. One murine pigmentation gene, the brown (b) locus, when mutated leads to a brown (b/b) or hypopigmented (Blt/Blt) coat versus the wild-type black (B/B). We show that the b locus codes for a glycoprotein with the activity of a catalase (hydrogen-peroxide:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6) (catalase B). Only the c locus protein is a tyrosinase. Because peroxides may be by-products of melanogenic activity and hydrogen peroxide in particular is known to destroy melanin precursors and melanin, we conclude that pigmentation is controlled not only by tyrosinase but also by a hydroperoxidase. Our studies indicate that catalase B is identical with gp75, a known human melanosomal glycoprotein; that the b mutation is in a heme-associated domain; and that the Blt mutation renders the protein susceptible to rapid proteolytic degradation.\r"

  ".U": "90280467\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, we have investigated the potential mechanisms responsible for the loss of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific cytolytic activity in the advanced stages of HIV-1 infection. We have demonstrated that HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are predominantly contained within the CD8+DR+ subset. Furthermore, we have shown by a redirected killing assay that there is a dichotomy between HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity and broad cytolytic potential since the cytolytic machinery of CD8+DR+ cells is still functioning even in patients with AIDS who have lost their HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity. In addition, by comparative analysis of these two types of cytolytic activity over time we have demonstrated a progressive loss of HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity in the advanced stages of the disease, whereas the cytolytic potential remained unchanged regardless of the clinical stage. As previously shown in patients with AIDS, even in asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive patients, CD8+DR+ cells from the same patient, compared to CD8+DR- lymphocytes, showed a substantial reduction in their ability to proliferate in vitro in response to different stimuli, such as mitogens (phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3, CD2, and CD28 molecules, and displayed a defective clonogenic potential. Thus, on the basis of these results we propose that the loss of HIV-1-specific cytolytic activity in HIV-1-infected individuals may result at least in part from a progressive decrease in the pool of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes belonging to the CD8+DR+ subset whose ability to expand has been impaired.\r"

NAC, which replenishes intracellular glutathione, effectively inhibits the tumor necrosis factor alpha- or phorbol ester-stimulated replication of HIV in acutely infected cell cultures. NAC also inhibits the cytokine-enhanced HIV long terminal repeat-directed expression of beta-galactosidase in in vitro HIV model systems. These results show that intracellular thiol levels influence HIV production. Furthermore, because NAC reverses tumor necrosis factor alpha toxicity both in cells and in animals and is a well-known drug that can be administered orally without known toxicity in humans, these results suggest that NAC is a possible therapeutic agent in AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "90280482\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of phospholipase C regulation by inhibitory receptors was analyzed both in intact and in permeabilized rat thyroid cells (FRTL5). In this system, the muscarinic agonist carbachol inhibited phospholipase C, as indicated by the decrease in the basal levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as well as by the reduced adrenergic stimulation of phosphoinositol accumulation, which was paralleled by a fall in the cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This inhibition involved an M2 muscarinic receptor because it was abolished by atropine but not by the M1 antagonist pirenzepine. Cells pretreated with pertussis toxin were not responsive to carbachol, indicating the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in this inhibitory process. This possibility was further evaluated in permeabilized cells, where the carbachol inhibition was shown to be completely dependent on GTP. Known second messengers were not involved in this inhibitory process since Ca2+, cAMP, and activators of protein kinases were not able to mimic or prevent the carbachol effect either in intact or in permeabilized FRTL5 cells. In this system, the phospholipases C and A2 are coupled to two classes of muscarinic receptors that display a different sensitivity to pertussis toxin. The carbachol inhibitory effect occurred under conditions that prevented activation of phospholipase A2, excluding a role of the arachidonic acid metabolism in this process. Taken together these data provide the strongest support to date that an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein sensitive to pertussis toxin can directly mediate receptor-induced inhibition of phospholipase C.\r"

Histologically (also radiographically), the lesions may be mistaken for malignant neoplasms such as osteosarcoma or parosteal osteosarcoma, especially when the pathologist does not receive representative material. In this series, malignancy was suspected in eight patients. Radiologic and pathologic criteria that may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of this lesion are presented. It is important that this nonneoplastic, benign, and self-limiting process in the hands and feet be recognized and treated accordingly. Local excision is adequate therapy in most cases, with little risk of local recurrence.\r"

However, with changes in mean blood flow velocity, the degree of change in CBF tended to be underestimated. The resistive index correlated well with perfusion pressure but correlated weakly with cerebrovascular resistance and poorly with changes in CBF. Doppler blood flow estimates and mean blood flow velocities correlate well with changes in CBF and allow significant improvement in accuracy over instantaneous velocity or pulsatility measurements alone. Determination of absolute blood flow remains difficult due to systolic and diastolic differences in vessel diameter and intrinsic error in true diameter measurement with currently available color flow technology.\r"

To assess its efficacy, we used cysteamine-induced ulcer and measured gastric mucosal blood flow in rats. The incidence of cysteamine-induced ulcer formation was reduced significantly in the group that underwent CO2 laser vagotomy compared with a group treated with proximal gastric vagotomy. Gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly better in the CO2 laser vagotomy group. Long-term follow-up of acid reduction was evaluated in dogs by the pentagastrin-stimulation test. Acid reduction in dogs was satisfactory during the 12 months of this study. CO2 laser vagotomy is a new, easy, time-saving, and circulatory-preserving technique for peptic ulcer disease.\r"

It was possible to separate an average of 690,000 +/- 279,429 islets per pancreas corresponding to 10,360 +/- 4034 islets per gram of pancreas with a volume of 714 +/- 480 mm3. After purification the recovery was 255,000 +/- 32,407 islets corresponding to 4,000 +/- 567 islets per gram of pancreas. Purity of the final preparation was 80% to 95% islets. Insulin content resulted in an average of 146.8 +/- 78 U before purification and 71 +/- 53 U after purification. After a 10 mm3 aliquot of the final preparation was transplanted under the renal subcapsular space of seven nude mice with diabetes, normoglycemia occurred in six of the mice. Thirty days after transplantation, nephrectomy of the kidneys bearing the grafts produced a rapid return to the diabetic state in all cases. This method makes it possible to provide large numbers of intact swine islets for preliminary studies of prevention of the rejection of pig islet xenograft by immunoalteration and immunoisolation procedures.\r"

The technique required for evaluation of elderly chronic care inpatients is different from methods that can be used in patients who do not have the ambulatory and cortical impairment that is common among chronic care inpatients. Since chronic care nursing staff involvement is necessary for accurate measurement and recording of incontinence episodes, a procedure for measurement must be well defined and clearly outlined in a sequence that can be followed easily. This study provides a method of incontinence volume assessment for elderly inpatients that can be performed by inpatient nursing staff to provide accurate incontinence volume measurements. Quantitative urinary incontinence volume measurements were done over ten days in 42 elderly men. Urinary incontinence presented as a significant problem in these patients over a wide range of both frequency and volume of urinary incontinence episodes. The volume measurement technique described allowed the nursing staff to identify, measure, and record incontinence severity over a wide range of frequency and volume while monitoring multiple patients simultaneously.\r"

The more expensive emergency admission had a high referral rate to urology from non-urologic clinical services.

Patients who received it exclusively through peripheral catheters were more likely to receive it short term. Among 72 patients receiving it perioperatively, those who were given support for uncomplicated surgical procedures or procedures complicated by postoperative ileus were more likely to receive it short term. We conclude that a substantial amount of parenteral nutrition use results in brief durations of support for conditions that are uncomplicated or self-limited. We have identified factors associated with this inappropriate use. A prospective consideration of these data could lead to the better use of this expensive form of nutritional support.\r"

In a prospective study of 158 TMJ arthrograms in 83 patients, coronal radiographs were obtained and videofluoroscopy was performed (in addition to routine sagittal films and fluoroscopy) to detect mediolateral shift of the meniscus and to evaluate the reducibility of this displacement.

On coronal images, in 79 cases (50%) the meniscus was shifted medially, in 22 cases (14%) laterally, and in 57 cases (36%) it was in the normal position. In 90 (89%) of the 101 abnormal cases, anterior displacement was associated with a mediolateral shift. In 59 cases (58%), the mediolateral shift was irreducible.

To ascertain the characteristics and frequency of detection of melanoma metastases to the axial skeleton by CT, we retrospectively reviewed 464 body CT studies of 125 consecutive melanoma patients for presence, appearance, and site of skeletal metastases. Results were correlated with patient's age, sex, clinical course, and both the Clark and Breslow classifications of the primary lesion. Of 98 patients with metastatic disease evident on their CT studies, 17 (17%) had bony metastases; two (12%) of these 17 patients had skeletal lesions as the only CT evidence of metastatic disease. Metastatic bony lesions were predominantly osteolytic, slightly expansile, and commonly located in the spine. Associated soft-tissue masses were frequent, but periosteal reaction and identifiable tumor matrix were not seen. Skeletal metastases were found only in those patients with thick or intermediate primary melanoma (Breslow) classified as Clark level III or greater, and the CT demonstration of osseous metastases was a poor prognostic sign. The data suggest that CT detection of skeletal melanoma metastases is not uncommon. When CT is performed to evaluate for metastatic melanoma, the axial skeleton should be carefully examined, especially in those patients with more advanced primary lesions.\r"

Clinically, the tumor presented as a hard, painless, nodular scalp mass. The prevalence in women outnumbered that in men by 3:1, with most cases occurring between the second and third decades of life. Plain radiographs showed a rounded, sessile bone growth of variable size arising from the outer table of the skull. The tumor was heavily ossified centrally with variable margins and, at times, with radiating bony spicules at the periphery. No satellite bone nodules were noted in adjacent soft tissues. In three cases a fine radiolucent cleft was demonstrated between the tumor and the underlying outer table on the tangential radiographs or CT. After en bloc resection of the tumor, follow-ups for 20 years in one patient and 1 year in two patients showed no recurrence. Parosteal osteosarcoma of the skull is a rare low-grade tumor that usually arises from the outer table of the skull and has distinctive radiologic features that should distinguish it from other exophytic cranial bone neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the impact of prenatal detection on neonates with hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, we reviewed 40 such cases seen between June 1982 and April 1989. This six-per-year rate contrasts with fewer than one case per year that was seen at our hospital from 1947 to 1977. Nineteen patients had an ectopic ureterocele, and 21 had an ectopic ureter without a ureterocele. Thirty-three (83%) were girls. Thirty-three cases were discovered because of abnormal findings on a prenatal sonogram, and 20 of those infants were asymptomatic. In the 33 patients whose prenatal sonographic findings were abnormal, the sonogram was diagnostically precise for hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system in only 39%. This imprecision did not adversely affect management or outcome. Postnatal sonography modified the prenatal diagnosis in 75% of these 33 patients. Voiding cystourethrography was the most sensitive and precise imaging technique for detecting both ureterocele and reflux. Lower pole reflux was almost twice as common when an ectopic ureterocele was present (63%) than when one was not (33%). Prenatal sonographic detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system decreased the proportion of neonates presenting with urinary tract infection and urosepsis because of prophylactic antibiotics initiated at birth and continued until surgical correction. Precise prenatal diagnosis was not needed for effective surgical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients with colloid cysts of the third ventricle were examined with CT and MR. In six, surgical resection was performed and the material was subjected to histologic evaluation; the concentrations of trace elements were determined by particle-induced X-ray emission. Stereotaxic aspiration was performed in two. The investigation showed that colloid cysts are often iso- or hypodense relative to brain on CT (5/8), but sometimes have a center of increased density. Increased density did not correlate with increased concentration of calcium or other metals but did correlate with high cholesterol content. Colloid cysts appear more heterogeneous on MR (6/8) than on CT (3/8), despite a homogeneous appearance at histology. High signal on short TR/TE sequences is correlated with a high cholesterol content. A marked shortening of the T2 relaxation time is often noticed in the central part of the cyst. Analysis of trace elements showed that this phenomenon is not related to the presence of metals with paramagnetic effects. Our analysis of the contents of colloid cysts does not support the theory that differing metallic concentrations are responsible for differences in MR signal intensity or CT density. We did find that increased CT density and high MR signal correlated with high cholesterol content.\r"

  ".U": "90282047\r", 
  ".W": "MR images of pineal region tumors were analyzed in 26 patients with histologically proved tumors: seven germ-cell tumors, six astrocytomas, five teratomas, three pineoblastomas, two meningiomas, one dermoid, one epidermoid, and one metastasis. In an attempt to identify specific MR characteristics of these lesions, Gd-DTPA was administered to six patients. CSF and blood serum were assayed for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin-beta subunit (HCG-beta) in 18 patients. MR findings were correlated with age, sex, the presence of biochemical tumor markers, and surgical outcome. We found that the most important factors in the determination of tumor type were the patient's age and the tumor markers. Increased levels of both HCG-beta and AFP were specific for patients with malignant teratomas and undifferentiated germ-cell tumors. HCG-beta alone was elevated in the patient with choriocarcinoma; only AFP was elevated in the patient with an endodermal sinus tumor. Tumor markers were not present in other patients in this series. The tumor size and the presence of fat were also helpful in determining tumor type. Hemorrhage was rare, seen only in the patient with a choriocarcinoma. Gd-DTPA did not enhance diagnostic specificity but aided in the detection of tumor seeding through CSF. We conclude that, although MR is sensitive in the detection of pineal region tumors and provides superb anatomic detail, MR signal characteristics are usually nonspecific. Correlation with the patient's age and the tumor markers significantly improves diagnostic accuracy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a volume gradient-echo MR angiography (MRA) technique with that of intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IA DSA) in the identification of intracranial aneurysms. The intracranial vasculature was examined in 47 patients by MRA and compared with IA DSA findings in 19 of these patients who had saccular or giant intracranial aneurysms. The remaining 28 patients, in whom no aneurysm was found, served as a control group. MRA was performed with the use of a velocity-compensated gradient-echo sequence (TR = 40-50/TE = 7-15) with a 15 degrees flip angle. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the evaluation of the cine 3D reconstructions (cine MRA) only, cine MRA + inspection of the individual partitions, and cine MRA + individual partitions + spin-echo studies. Of 21 aneurysms, of which three were missed in two patients, the sensitivity varied from 67% for cine MRA only to 86% for the cine MRA + partitions + spin-echo studies; of the 19 patients, among whom it was assumed that the diagnosis of any one aneurysm in a patient would lead to angiography and detection of additional aneurysms, the sensitivity varied from 73% for the cine MRA only to 95% for the cine MRA + partitions + spin-echo studies. The results of this study suggest that MRA can define the circle of Willis sufficiently to allow detection of intracranial aneurysms as small as 3-4 mm. MRA holds promise as a truly noninvasive screening examination of intracranial vasculature in patients at risk for aneurysms.\r"

By using the three-dimensional phase-sensitive method of Dumoulin, Souza, and collaborators, we acquired MR angiograms in 37 min and portrayed blood flow in all the major arteries and veins. Feeding arteries and draining veins of arteriovenous malformations were well delineated; aneurysms as small as 3-4 mm were shown, and obstructed cerebral vessels and the patency of a highly stenotic internal carotid artery were demonstrated. MR angiography of the head or neck offers great promise as a noninvasive means of studying vascular abnormalities.\r"

The filter was inserted without difficulty in 29 (97%) of the patients. Complications after insertion included recurrent pulmonary embolism in two (7%) of 30, caval thrombosis in seven (23%) of 30, ipsilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis after placement of the filter in one (3%) of 30, caval penetration in two (10%) of 20, and caval stenosis in one (5%) of 20. No migration of the filter was noted. Our experience suggests that the Amplatz vena caval filter is easy to insert and adequately prevents recurrent pulmonary embolism but is associated with a relatively high rate of caval thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study was performed to determine if the chest radiograph could serve as a predictor for acute lung rejection in heart-lung transplantation patients. The findings on chest radiographs were correlated with the results of transbronchial biopsies in 16 heart-lung transplantation patients. The chest radiographs immediately preceding 83 biopsies were evaluated for a variety of findings. The histopathologic results of the lung biopsies were divided into five categories: (1) acute lung rejection (n = 25); (2) suggestive, but not diagnostic, of acute lung rejection (n = 8); (3) nonspecific (n = 26); (4) infection (n = 17); and (5) normal lung (n = 9). Biopsies from two patients showed both acute lung rejection and cytomegalovirus infection and were included in both categories. These histopathologic results were then correlated with the radiologic observations. We found that the combination of septal lines and new or increasing pleural effusions, without concomitant increase in cardiac size or vascular pedicle width, or evidence of vascular redistribution, indicated acute lung rejection with a sensitivity of 68% (17/25), specificity of 90% (52/58), and overall accuracy of 83% (69/83). We conclude that the chest radiograph is a useful indicator of acute lung rejection.\r"

  ".W": "During a 5-year period, 28 women who had been treated conservatively for breast carcinoma had 29 reexcisions of the lumpectomy site because of suspicion of a recurrent malignant tumor. Biopsy results were benign in 19 cases and malignant in 10 cases. Sixteen of the 19 benign tumors had developed within 2 years after therapy. In 16 benign cases, a palpable lump developed at the scar and was found on biopsy to be fat necrosis or fibrosis. Seven of these cases had normal mammographic findings. Three women with abnormal mammographic findings but a normal breast examination had punctate microcalcifications develop at the scar; these were due to fibrosis in two and sclerosing adenosis in the other. Of the 10 malignant recurrent tumors, seven were palpable, four of which also were identifiable by mammography. Of seven mammographically identifiable recurrent tumors at the surgical site, four were palpable. Mammographic findings were a single mass in two cases, multiple masses in one, microcalcification in three, and a mass with microcalcifications in one. Malignant microcalcifications were all linear, irregular, and in one case branching. Mean time to recurrence in these 10 women was 3 years. This experience suggests that benign disease usually occurs at the scar within 2 years after the original therapy and when palpable may not show changes on mammography. When microcalcifications do occur, they are usually punctate.\r"

We report six patients who developed seven breast cancers after treatment for Hodgkin disease. The average age of the women at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer was 33.5 years; diagnosis was made 10-23 years after treatment. There appears to be an increased prevalence of breast carcinoma in women who have been treated for Hodgkin disease. This association should receive further study to evaluate appropriate modifications in routine breast cancer screening for these women.\r"

  ".W": "Recently a new nonionizing, nonimaging technique for evaluating risk of breast cancer, in vivo optical spectroscopy (INVOS), became available. The procedure evaluates the biochemical composition of the breast with spectrophotometry to provide a risk number related to the development of breast cancer. INVOS was evaluated in a prospective study of 180 women who were referred to our institution for needle localization and excisional biopsy of 181 breast lesions. All women had mammography and INVOS before surgical biopsy. The INVOS risk numbers and mammographic findings were compared with the pathologic diagnoses. Of 39 breast cancers, 19 (49%) had high-risk INVOS numbers, as did 52% of women with benign disease. INVOS had a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 4%, and a positive predictive value of 21% for the detection of breast cancer. Mammography predicted malignancy with a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 48%, and a positive predictive value of 34%. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis also was performed. The ROC area for mammography was 0.85 compared with 0.43 for INVOS, indicating a significantly greater (p less than .0000001) ability for mammography to detect breast cancer. We conclude that because INVOS cannot accurately predict the presence of breast cancer, it is unlikely that INVOS can be used to predict which patients are at risk for the development of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of various imaging procedures used for the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (lesions no larger than 3 cm in diameter) was evaluated in a retrospective study of 100 patients. Seven patients with hepatic adenomatous hyperplastic nodules containing HCC foci were also assessed. In 89 patients, the lesion was initially detected during follow-up of chronic liver disease. In 21 patients, it was first diagnosed on the basis of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein; in the remaining 79 it was diagnosed incidentally with imaging procedures. The overall sensitivities of sonography (84%), CT (84%), and angiography (81%) were compared with those of arterial angiographic CT (82%), portal angiographic CT (91%), lipiodol CT (93%), and intraoperative sonography (96%). The differences in sensitivity between angiography and lipiodol CT (p less than .05) and between intraoperative sonography and the other studies (p less than .01) were statistically significant. In 22 lesions smaller than 1 cm, the sensitivities of lipiodol CT and intraoperative sonography were high (83% and 86%, respectively). Adenomatous hyperplasias containing HCC foci were frequently detected by arterial angiographic CT and intraoperative sonography. These results show that sonography or CT and alpha-fetoprotein are useful in detecting small HCCs in screening programs of patients with chronic liver disease. Lipiodol CT and intraoperative sonography are necessary in patients who are candidates for surgery.\r"

Lesion/liver margin sharpness, lesion shape, and overall lesion morphologic pattern were evaluated also. Univariate logistic regression analysis of the quantitative data showed that T2 was the only statistically significant (p less than .02) variable for distinguishing a hemangioma from a metastasis. A receiver-operator-characteristic plot of T2 produced an area of 0.80 (+/- 0.08). T2 values for these lesions still overlapped with those for metastases. Morphologically, hemangiomas were sharply marginated (80%), rounded or oval (93%), homogeneous, hyperintense lesions (73%), whereas metastases were poorly marginated (66%) and inhomogenous (67%) lesions. The marked, hyperintense appearance was present in 27% of metastases. Retrospective, multivariate logistic regression analysis of T2 and the presence of hyperintense morphology did not improve results based on T2 alone. Morphologic criteria are helpful in differentiation, as some metastases have a prolonged T2 and are not homogenous, hyperintense lesions. In cases where T2 or morphology are equivocal, other diagnostic tests may help confirm the MR findings. We currently use a T2 of greater than 88 msec and the presence of hyperintense morphology to diagnose hemangiomas. Despite both quantitative and qualitative analysis, data for these hemangiomas and metastases still overlap.\r"

Ninety-two liver masses up to 5 cm in diameter, including 51 proved hemangiomas (mean, 1.9 +/- 1.1 cm) and 41 proved metastases (mean, 1.9 +/- 1.2 cm) were analyzed. Lesions were divided into three groups on the basis of size (less than or equal to 1 cm, greater than 1- less than or equal to 2 cm, greater than 2- less than or equal to 5 cm). The ability to distinguish hemangiomas from metastases was examined by using differences in lesion/liver signal-intensity ratio (SIR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on T2-weighted images (SE 2350/180). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis for all lesions grouped together showed that differentiation based on SIR was superior to that based on CNR (p less than .05). The mean SIR of hemangioma and the difference between mean SIRs of hemangioma and metastasis decreased with lesion size (greater than 2- less than or equal to 5 cm: 6.11 +/- 2.61 vs 2.30 +/- 1.22; greater than 1- less than or equal to 2 cm: 4.47 +/- 1.56 vs 2.40 +/- 0.73; less than or equal to 1 cm: 3.59 +/- 0.92 vs 2.01 +/- 0.52). However, in each size group, the difference between the mean SIR of hemangioma and metastasis was statistically significant (p less than .0001). These observations suggest that MR imaging is useful in differentiating small hepatic hemangiomas from small metastases and suggest the need for establishing size-specific quantitative criteria for tissue characterization.\r"

One stone from each set was fragmented by a mechanical lithotriptor and then treated with methyl tert-butyl ether, and one was used as control and was treated intact. The third stone was analyzed for its density pattern on CT and biochemically for its cholesterol and calcium content. On the basis of CT appearance, the stones were classified as noncalcified, partially calcified, or heavily calcified. Mechanical fragmentation reduced dissolution time by 25-69% (mean +/- SD, 44 +/- 16%) for the noncalcified stones and by 20-42% (mean +/- SD, 30 +/- 8%) for the partially calcified stones. No significant reduction was observed for the heavily calcified stones. The degree of reduction was inversely related to maximal stone density (r = -.72) and was independent of its pattern of calcification. This study shows that mechanical fragmentation is effective in accelerating gallstone chemolysis by methyl tert-butyl ether for noncalcified and partially calcified but not for heavily calcified stones.\r"

The mean densities of mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat in patients with cirrhosis were -56, -107, and -111 H, respectively. The corresponding mean densities in control subjects were -107, -118, and -124 H. The mean density of mesenteric fat in patients with cirrhosis was 50% greater than that of their subcutaneous fat (p less than .0001), 48% greater than that of their retroperitoneal fat (p less than .0001), and 48% greater than that of the mesenteric fat in control subjects (p less than .0001). The mean density of subcutaneous fat in the anterior abdominal wall in patients with cirrhosis was -96 H compared with -119 H for that in their posterior abdominal wall. The corresponding mean densities in control subjects were -109 and -131 H. Density of subcutaneous fat in the anterior abdominal wall for all subjects (patients and controls) was 18% greater than that of subcutaneous fat in the posterior abdominal wall (p less than .05). In all locations, the statistical trend was for patients with cirrhosis to have higher density fat than did control subjects. These changes in density are thought to represent diffuse fat edema, most prominently in the mesentery because of portal hypertension.\r"

Thirty-two abscesses, 10 renal and 22 renal with perirenal extension, in 30 patients (16 female, 14 male; age range, 5-83 years), were drained percutaneously. Twenty-one patients had had surgery recently and/or were immunosuppressed. Ten of the 13 postoperative patients had had surgical procedures involving the urinary tract. Size of the abscesses ranged from 10 to 650 ml, and all were drained via CT or fluoroscopic guidance. The type of drainage catheter used depended on the size of the abscess. Complications were unusual. A transient febrile episode without sequelae within the first 12 hr of catheter placement was the most common complication. All patients had their abscess catheter placed while in the hospital; 12 (40%) subsequently were followed up (2-50 days) as outpatients until their catheters were removed without complications. Percutaneous drainage alone was curative in 20 patients (67%) as determined by resolution of signs and symptoms or follow-up CT. Eight (27%) had improvement of signs and symptoms but required surgery to remove tumor (one patient) or a poorly functioning or nonfunctioning kidney (five patients), perform open pyelolithotomy (one patient), or drain a loculated abscess (one patient); all eventually were cured. Three patients (10%) with multiple medical problems died before resolution could be documented, although death was not thought to be directly related to failure of therapy. Our results indicate that percutaneous drainage alone is curative in the majority of cases of renal and perirenal abscesses. Many patients can be treated safely, in part, on an outpatient basis.\r"

We evaluated 27 cancer patients with pelvic pain by using radionuclide bone scintigraphy (24 patients), abdominal CT (27 patients), and pelvic MR imaging (27 patients) and used the correlation between symptoms and imaging findings to compare these imaging methods. The study population included 11 patients with Ewing sarcoma, six with other sarcomas, five with colorectal cancers, and five with other tumors. All patients had pelvic pain, and eight had pain radiating to a leg. Twenty-three patients had soft-tissue masses, and 19 had bone metastases; 16 had both. Findings on bone scans explained the symptoms in 17 (71%) of 24 patients, findings on CT in 23 (85%) of 27 patients, and findings on MR imaging in 25 (93%) of 27 patients. The difference between bone scanning and CT or MR was statistically significant (p less than .05); however, the difference between CT and MR imaging was not significant (p greater than .05). MR imaging detected 41 (98%) of 42 relevant lesions, whereas CT detected 31 (74%) of 42, and bone scanning 17 (44%) of 39. We conclude that MR is superior to either bone scanning or CT in the initial evaluation of pelvic pain in cancer patients. Such information can be important in directing the treatment of these patients.\r"

In 21 cases (13%), CT showed an anterior cortical fracture of the femoral head that could not be seen on plain radiographs. This injury is similar to the Hill-Sachs lesion of the humerus that results from anterior dislocation. The anterior cortical fracture was associated with fractures of the posterior acetabulum in 18 cases (86%). The anterior fracture is caused by impaction of the anterior femoral head against the posterior acetabular rim at the time of dislocation. We conclude that anterior cortical fracture of the femoral head is a common accompaniment to posterior acetabular dislocation.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind trial of the European Cooperative Study Group, 721 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 5 hours' duration were given either 100 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) intravenously over 3 hours or an equivalent placebo infusion. In a subset of 312 patients, infarct size was assessed by the cumulative myocardial release of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) during the first 72 hours and by planar thallium scintigraphy (index of hypoperfusion) performed 10 to 22 days after the acute event. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was determined by contrast and nuclear angiography. The median values of HBDH during the first 72 hours were 20% lower and the median values of thallium-201 28% smaller in the rt-PA group in comparison with controls. A significant but limited improvement of angiographic LVEF (2 absolute percentage points) was also shown in the patients treated with rt-PA. A moderate but statistically significant linear association between both measurements of infarct size and LVEF was found.\r"

  ".W": "An ability of intravenous nitroglycerin to interfere with the anticoagulant properties of intravenous heparin would have profound clinical implications. To investigation nitroglycerin-heparin interactions, the following pilot study was performed. Patients (N = 18) admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of either acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina were divided into four treatment groups: (1) intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin; (2) intravenous nitroglycerin alone; (3) intravenous heparin alone; or (4) neither intravenous nitroglycerin nor intravenous heparin. Serial determinations of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), serum heparin concentration, antithrombin III (ATIII) antigen (ATA), and ATIII activity (ATC) were obtained over a 72-hour period. Overall, patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin did not differ significantly from other patients in APTT, heparin dose, heparin concentration, ATA, ATC, or ATA/ATC ratio (ATR). However, patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin at a rate exceeding 350 micrograms per minute had a lower APTT (p less than 0.05), lower ATC (p = 0.02), higher ATR (p = 0.004), and a larger heparin dose requirement than patients receiving lower infusion rates. ATR correlated directly (r = 0.91; p less than 0.05) and ATC inversely (r = -0.78; p less than 0.05) with the intravenous nitroglycerin dose. Serum heparin concentration did not correlate with the intravenous nitroglycerin dose. Intravenous nitroglycerin-induced heparin resistance occurs at a critical nitroglycerin dose. A nitroglycerin-induced qualitative ATIII abnormality may be the underlying mechanism.\r"
