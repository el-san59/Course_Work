Daily monitoring of PEFR was helpful in demonstrating the response to therapy during hospitalization and at follow-up visit (1 to 2 weeks) posthospitalization. This change in PEFR during acute hospitalization and at initial follow-up visit did not correlate well with relapse or repeat hospitalization during the 5- to 17-month follow-up period.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of epinephrine and norepinephrine on cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption after five minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest and three minutes of open-chest cardiac massage was studied in 21 pigs. Norepinephrine, like epinephrine, has a marked alpha- and beta 1-sympathomimetic activity, but compared with epinephrine, the degree of beta 2-stimulation is weak. Epinephrine probably stimulates cerebral oxygen and glucose consumption by its beta 2-adrenergic effect. After three minutes of CPR, three groups of seven animals each blindly received either placebo (control group), 45 micrograms/kg epinephrine, or 45 micrograms/kg norepinephrine. During CPR but before drug administration, cerebral blood flow was 23 +/- 14 mL/min/100 g in the control group, 30 +/- 7 mL/min/100 g in the epinephrine group, and 30 +/- 11 mL/min/100 g in the norepinephrine group. At 90 seconds after epinephrine, cerebral blood flow increased to 54 +/- 14 mL/min/100 g and after norepinephrine, to 58 +/- 22 mL/min/100 g (P less than .05). Cerebral perfusion pressure for both drugs was significantly higher than the control group. Compared with mechanical measures alone, cerebral oxygen delivery rose from 4.3 +/- 1.2 to 7.4 +/- 1.7 mL/min/100 g after epinephrine and from 3.7 +/- 1.4 to 7.3 +/- 2.7 mL/min/100 g after norepinephrine (P less than .05). There was no increase in cerebral oxygen consumption after both catecholamines, and cerebral oxygen extraction ratio decreased. Cerebral glucose delivery increased in relation to glucose consumption, and extraction ratio did not change significantly after both catecholamines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In July 1988, our emergency department adopted a policy of refusing to treat patients in the ED if they failed to have what was considered an emergency condition. Screening examinations were performed by triage nurses to determine whether patients were eligible to be seen in the ED. Patients whose vital signs fell within specific categories and who had one of 50 minor chief complaints were refused care in the ED and referred to off-site clinics. The referral of these patients out of the ED after a screening examination falls within the scope of legislation governing ED care and transfer (federal COBRA, Cal SB-12, and Title 22) as determined by the University of California legal counsel. In the first six months of this new triage system, 4,186 patients were referred from the ED; this represented 19% of total ambulatory patients who presented to the triage area. Of the 4,186 patients refused care, 84% were referred to off-site nonuniversity clinics, and 15% were referred to a university-affiliated faculty-staffed clinic. Follow-up letters and telephone calls to their clinics identified no patients who needed retriage to an ED, and only 54 patients (1.3%) complained about their referral out of the ED. Only 42 patients returned to the ED within 48 hours of initial triage, and none had a deterioration of their condition. In conclusion, a selective triage system may be used to effectively decompress an ED, although further study is needed to identify potential rare adverse outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "A relative bradycardia is sometimes seen in patients with hemorrhagic shock. The phenomenon of relative bradycardia in civilian patients with isolated penetrating abdominal trauma and isolated severe extremity trauma who presented to an urban trauma center was studied retrospectively. Relative bradycardia was defined as a pulse rate of less than 100 with a concomitant systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. There were 256 patients with isolated penetrating abdominal trauma and 938 patients with isolated severe extremity trauma. The incidence of relative bradycardia was 3.1% (eight of 256) in the group with abdominal trauma and 1.8% (17 of 938) in the group with extremity trauma. A pulse rate less than 100 was documented in 35.2% of all patients presenting with a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg (25 of 71). A pulse rate of less than 100 was documented in 45.8% of all patients presenting with a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg (11 of 24). No increased mortality was seen in the patients who evidenced relative bradycardia. The effect of intraperitoneal bleeding on the normal tachycardic response to hemorrhage also was studied. After controlling for volume status using various operational definitions of shock, no statistically significant (P less than .01) difference in pulse rates was noted between patients with isolated penetrating abdominal trauma and isolated extremity trauma. This result suggests that the previously theorized vagal-mediated bradycardia unique to intraperitoneal bleeding may not exist.\r"

Twenty patients met the study criteria. The average age was 37 years (range, 11 to 65 years). Indications for prehospital cricothyrotomy were massive facial trauma (eight), failed oral intubation (seven), and suspected cervical-spine injury (one). Cricothyrotomy was attempted in 16 patients (80%), with the remaining four having the procedure ordered but not attempted. A successful airway was achieved in 14 patients (88%). Horizontal incisions were used in all cases and were anatomically correct in 15 of 16 attempts (94%). The overall immediate complication rate was 31%. Two patients (12%) sustained major complications (failure to obtain an airway). No hemorrhagic complications occurred, but 16 of the 20 were in cardiac arrest in the field. Long-term complications were not evaluated. All patients sustained major injuries (mean Injury Severity Score, 53.7), except one patient who suffered airway obstruction from food. Three patients (15%) survived; two of the three suffered permanent, severe brain dysfunction. These preliminary findings demonstrate that prehospital cricothyrotomy is being used chiefly in massively injured patients who are already beyond recovery. It is thus difficult to assess whether the procedure is either safe or effective. There is a need for further investigation to determine whether prehospital cricothyrotomy has any beneficial effect on outcome and, if so, in what setting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A committee of physicians, nurses, and paramedics developed performance criteria based on a county EMS protocol. Run tapes were reviewed to assess accuracy of runsheets. Deviations were categorized and tabulated with Lotus 1-2-3 software. A profile was developed for each agency and paramedic. Results were returned to supervisors of each agency on an intermittent basis with subsequent feedback to paramedics. Four agencies and 100 paramedics were audited during the 18-month study period, with a total of 2,406 runsheets reviewed. Average deficiencies per run per quarter for all paramedics decreased from 0.47 to 0.34 (P less than .006). For one agency, deficiencies per run declined from 1.98 to 1.06, although this was not statistically significant (P = .068). During the second nine-month segment of the study, the records of 62 paramedics were reviewed. A mean deficiency per run of 0.39 +/- 0.55 was found, with four paramedics performing more than two standard deviations from the mean. This receiving hospital EMS quality assurance audit has helped document problems in agency procedure performance and individual paramedic performance. It also has improved compliance with county protocol on patients delivered to our institution.\r"

A sequential protocol consisting of Valsalva maneuver, ice packs, pneumatic antishock garment inflation, and verapamil 0.5 mg IV was implemented in an urban emergency medical services system after appropriate paramedic education. On-line physician discretion could alter the protocol in specific clinical situations. Inclusion criteria required a narrow-complex regular tachycardia at a rate of between 150 and 250. Of 43 patients identified, the protocol was applied sequentially in 26 (60%) and with valid physician discretion in 15 patients (35%) (due to hypotension, chest pain, or dyspnea). Conversion to a more stable rhythm occurred in 25 patients (59%). Of these, all but one achieved a sinus mechanism. The Valsalva maneuver and ice pack application were ineffective in achieving rhythm conversion, being successful in only two of 33 (6%), one of 31 (3%), and four of 24 (17%) attempts, respectively (P greater than .05). Verapamil, however, was significantly more effective (18 of 24 attempts, 75%) than any of the other interventions either singly (P less than .01) or in combination (P less than .0001). No clinically important adverse effects occurred with any intervention, but application of the protocol increased mean on-scene time to 30.6 minutes. We conclude that verapamil is an effective agent for the prehospital termination of PSVT but that careful on-line physician supervision and a system for confirming rhythm identification are both essential.\r"

Because of our failure to resuscitate four patients with the standard American Heart Association protocol for cardiac arrest, we used a larger dose of epinephrine in an attempt to enhance resuscitative efforts. All patients required CPR and had nonperfusing rhythms for at least 20 minutes. The four patients received from 0.12 to 0.22 mg/kg epinephrine. Within five minutes of high-dose epinephrine, all four patients developed perfusing rhythms with maximum systolic blood pressures ranging from 134 to 220 mm Hg. Cardiac dysrhythmias did not occur after these doses of epinephrine. Only one of four patients had ECG evidence of an acute myocardial infarction. In this patient, the history suggested that the myocardial infarction was a primary event, not the consequence of epinephrine. All four patients sustained severe brain injury leading to their demise. This injury was probably due to prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest and global brain ischemia. Pharmacologic and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of high-dose epinephrine are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation of ovalbumin by conscious, sensitized guinea pigs induced two phases of airway obstruction measured at 2 h (EAR) and at 17 h (LAR), respectively. In addition to causing airway obstruction, allergen challenge induced an accumulation in the bronchial lumen of eosinophil and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 17 h. Intraperitoneal injection of guinea pigs with a specific rabbit anti-guinea pig neutrophil serum 24 h before challenge reduced the number of circulating neutrophils by 94% and the airway neutrophilia after challenge by 90%, but it had no effect on the magnitude of either the EAR or the LAR. The observation that the LAR was not effected by neutropenia supports previous conclusions derived from experiments using the anti-allergic drugs, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium, and the beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulant, albuterol, that, although there is a temporal relationship between neutrophil accumulation in the airways and the peak of the LAR, this polymorphonuclear leukocyte does not play a central role in the pathophysiologic processes that give rise to the late-phase response to guinea pig airways.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in humans suggests that airway inflammation may modulate nonspecific airway responsiveness. We studied in a rat model the effect of the inhalation of endotoxin on the cellular composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and airway responsiveness. The exposure to an aerosol of endotoxin caused a rapid influx of neutrophils in the airways. The neutrophils persisted up to 24 h after exposure. Elastase activity in lavage fluid became detectable 30 min after the endotoxin exposure and peaked 9 h later. The exposure to the endotoxin aerosol was followed 1 to 2 h later by a significant increase in the airway responsiveness to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT). However, the increase in responsiveness disappeared, and 9 to 12 h following the end of the exposure a significant decrease in airway 5HT responsiveness was observed at the moment that more than 80% of the cells contained in the BAL fluid were neutrophils. The effect of endotoxin on airway responsiveness and inflammation was dose dependent. We also compared in three different inbred rat strains the effect of endotoxin inhalation. The aerosol exposure induced in all three strains a comparable neutrophil influx in the airways, but only two of the three strains became hyperresponsive to 5HT. We conclude that the inhalation of endotoxin causes a neutrophilic airway inflammation in rats. The relationship between this airway inflammation and airway responsiveness is dependent on the time following the exposure and the animal strain used.\r"

  ".W": "Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMSA), the bisulfite (HSO3-) adduct of formaldehyde (CH2O), is a common constituent of California acid fogs. HMSA, most stable in a fog pH range of 3 to 5, dissociates at 6.6, the pH of the fluid lining human airways. The dissociation of inhaled HMSA should theoretically generate sulfur dioxide and CH2O, both of which have bronchoconstrictor potential. Thus, we hypothesized that HMSA may have a specific bronchoconstrictor effect independent of its strength as an acid. To determine whether HMSA has such an effect, 19 subjects with mild to moderate asthma were studied using two different protocols. Initially, a mouthpiece study was performed in which 9 subjects, on 2 separate days, inhaled five aerosols containing either sequentially increasing concentrations (0, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 microM) of HMSA in 50 microM sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or 50 microM H2SO4 alone. The subjects inhaled each aerosol for 3 min during tidal breathing at rest. Specific airway resistance (SRaw) was measured before and after each 3-min exposure. There were no significant differences in the mean changes in SRaw among the various aerosol exposures. To confirm this lack of bronchoconstrictor effect of HMSA, we then performed a chamber study in which 10 freely breathing, intermittently exercising subjects were exposed to fog containing either 1 mM HMSA in 5 mM H2SO4 or 5 mM H2SO4 alone for 1 h. SRaw was measured before, during, and at the end of the 1-h exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this type of asthma was associated with a different pattern of VA/Q inequality from that observed in acute episodes and in particular to determine whether the VA/Q pattern was fixed or could be altered by bronchodilator agents or O2 breathing. The predominant pattern of VA/Q distribution was broad and unimodal but without shunt (VA/Q = 0) or low VA/Q areas (VA/Q less than 0.1 to greater than 0.005). The amount of VA/Q inequality as assessed by the dispersion of the distribution of pulmonary bloodflow (log SDQ) was not great (log SDQ, 0.77 +/- 0.09), and no correlation was found with the degree of airway obstruction, PaO2 or AaPO2. During 100% O2 breathing, VA/Q inequality worsened (from log SDQ of 0.77 +/- 0.09 to 1.11 +/- 0.21, p = 0.01) with an increase in the perfusion of low VA/Q units (from 0.43 +/- 0.66% to 6.3 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.02) but still no development of shunt. This suggests the presence of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction breathing air, possibly contributing to the preservation of VA/Q relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the admission 6-min walk test, 32 non-COPD patients had an ambulation distance of 276 +/- 219 ft (SD). At completion of the program, their ambulation distance increased to 574 +/- 367 ft (increase in ambulation 298 +/- 290 ft, P less than 0.0001). Diagnostic subgroups improved to essentially the same extent. The increase in ambulation was not statistically different between non-COPD patients and a series of 317 patients with COPD.

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited fatal disorder among Caucasians. Bronchial mucus in CF contains more potassium and less sodium, which may be due to increased sodium absorption, resulting in a reduced airway water content. We studied 23 patients with CF after inhalation of normal saline or amiloride (10(-3) M), a sodium transport blocker. Mucociliary clearance (MC) and cough clearance (CC) were determined with a gamma camera that traced the movement of 99mTc-labeled, hardened erythrocytes over a 1-h period after the patients inhaled these particles as an aerosol. Before and after each investigation pulmonary function tests (PFT) and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Sputum thread formation was measured by means of a filancemeter. Six of the patients also completed a 3-wk trial of amiloride inhalation therapy. MC increased significantly (p less than 0.001) after acute amiloride inhalation (bronchial deposition, 0.07 mg amiloride) compared with that in the saline control. CC also increased, but not as much as MC. After 3 wk of amiloride inhalation (2 times a day) clearance values (both MC and CC) were markedly enhanced (p less than 0.01); after a similar period of saline inhalation, clearance values were not different from baseline. Sputum filance values also decreased significantly after amiloride inhalation. There were no adverse effects of the amiloride inhalation compared with saline. We conclude that amiloride inhalation administered as a single dose or as long-term therapy is able to increase MC and CC in CF airways and that the effect of 10(-3) M amiloride inhalation on MC lasts at least 40 min.

During the 10-yr follow-up, 225 subjects died from lung cancer. Percent predicted FEV1 (%FEV1) and presence of chronic phlegm were used to characterize ventilatory function and chronic mucus hypersecretion, respectively. Mortality analysis employed the multiple regression model of Cox and included age, sex, pack-years of smoking, and inhalation as confounding factors. %FEV1 and chronic phlegm were found to be significant predictors of death from lung cancer. In both men and women with chronic phlegm, the risk of dying from lung cancer was 1.5 greater than in those without phlegm. Compared with subjects with %FEV1 greater than or equal to 80, the subjects with %FEV1 less than 40 and those with %FEV1 between 40 and 79 had a 3.9 and 2.1 higher risk of lung cancer death, respectively. A similar regression model in which %FEV1 was replaced with the ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1/FVC) showed that lowered FEV1/FVC was also a significant predictor of lung cancer death, the subjects with FEV1/FVC less than 0.6 (0.6 to 0.7) having a 2.6 (1.5) higher risk for lung cancer death than those with FEV1/FVC greater than or equal to 0.7. It is concluded that lowered ventilatory function and chronic mucus hypersecretion are both significant predictors of death from lung cancer, even after standardization for smoking.\r"

No evidence of pulmonary opportunistic infection was found. When compared to an otherwise similar group of HIV-seronegative controls, the patients exercised to a significantly lower workload (195 +/- 30 versus 227 +/- 31 W, p less than 0.001). The ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) values were also significantly lower for the patients (49.2 +/- 13.0 versus 61.9 +/- 9.1% of maximum predicted VO2, p less than 0.001). Nine of the patients had VAT values less than the 95% confidence interval for the controls. This subgroup exercised to a significantly lower maximum VO2 (69.9 +/- 11.2 versus 95.9 +/- 17.5% of maximum predicted VO2, p less than 0.001) and workload (165 +/- 21 versus 227 +/- 31 W) when compared to the control group. These patients demonstrated a mild tachypnea throughout exercise relative to the controls and had a significant increase in the slope of the heart rate to VO2 relationship. These findings are most consistent with a limitation of oxygen delivery to exercising muscles, which may represent occult cardiac disease in this group.\r"

Because of alterations in ventricular function, DO2 may be inadequate to satisfy oxygen demand and may contribute to multiple-system organ failure (MSOF). To determine whether there are differences in DO2, VO2, ventricular function, and MSOF, between survivors and nonsurvivors of ARDS, we studied 29 patients without cardiac disease early in the course of ARDS (hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure less than 18 mm Hg). Simultaneous hemodynamic, radionuclide cineangiographic, and oxygen transport measurements were made within 24 h of onset of ARDS. Thirteen survivors had greater DO2 and VO2 than did 16 nonsurvivors (p = 0.004 and 0.001, respectively). MSOF developed in no survivors and in 63% of nonsurvivors. In four survivors and in six nonsurvivors in whom DO2 was changed acutely, VO2 was dependent on DO2 (p = 0.014). Survivors had greater stroke volume index and right and left ventricular end-diastolic volume indices than did nonsurvivors despite similar right atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures. There were no differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in biventricular ejection fractions. We conclude that survivors of ARDS have greater DO2 and VO2 than do nonsurvivors. Survival may be explained by the strong inverse relation between DO2 and development of MSOF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A pharmacokinetic model is described for testing of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase inhibitors administered by intratracheal or aerosol dosing of hamsters. Acute lung injury, measured as hemorrhage occurring within hours after intratracheal instillation of human PMN elastase, correlated directly with the amount of active enzyme instilled. Hemorrhage began within minutes of elastase instillation, was maximal within 1 h, and remained constant for up to 5 h subsequently. Therefore, inhibition of hemorrhage was used as an assay of the effectiveness of various PMN elastase inhibitors given by the intratracheal route. Lung hemorrhage could also be induced by intratracheal instillation of other elastolytic enzymes, such as thermolysin, and inhibition of hemorrhage was seen only with inhibitors active against the type of elastase used. Methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valine-chloromethylketone (MeOSuc-AAPV-CMK), as well as alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI) but not tosyl-lysine-chloromethylketone (tosyl-lysine-CMK), inhibited the hemorrhage caused by human PMN elastase, but the specific inhibitors of this enzyme had no effect on thermolysin-induced lung hemorrhage. The duration of activity of these compounds as elastase inhibitors in this model correlated directly with the extent of their persistence in lung lavage fluid as determined by HPLC analysis of compound recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage.

The activities of SOD and CAT from AM of smokers and smoke-exposed hamsters were twice that found in control subjects (p less than 0.01), but there was no change in the activity of GSHPx. Using the hamster model, we found that filtration of smoke attenuated the increase in antioxidant activities, and that after smoking cessation, the increased activities had returned to those found with control subjects. An adaptive response was further suggested by prolonged survival of smoke-exposed hamsters in normobaric hyperoxia (O2 greater than 95%). Chronic smoke exposure in humans or hamsters causes increased SOD and CAT activities in AM. This augmented activity may serve as a mechanism to limit oxidant-mediated damage to alveolar structures.\r"

  ".W": "The major inhibitor of the cysteine class of proteinases found in human body fluids, such as spinal fluid, milk, and seminal plasma, is cystatin C. In this study we show that human bronchoalveolar fluid also contains cystatin C and examine cystatin C expression by alveolar macrophages in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of extracts of metabolically labeled cells and immunoblotting of cellular extracts and culture media show that cystatin C is synthesized as a 14 (+/- 0.5) kilodalton (kD) protein and that greater than 90% of the protein is released as the 14 kD product into the culture supernatant (26.5 +/- 6.8 ng per 10(6) cells per 24 h). Cystatin C is not one of the most abundant proteins secreted during the first 24 h in vitro, representing approximately 10 to 12% of the total protein released by normal nonsmoker macrophages. Alveolar macrophages obtained from cigarette smokers or nonsmoker macrophages exposed to zymosan in vitro released 10 to 55% less cystatin C than nonsmoker macrophages. We also assayed culture supernatants from macrophages of smokers and nonsmokers for functional cystatin C. Supernatants of nonsmoker macrophages inhibited cathepsin B-like amidolytic activity in a fluorometric assay at pH 5.5. The inhibition was blocked by adsorption with Sepharose-coupled cystatin C antibodies and the inhibitor subsequently recovered from the Sepharose beads. In contrast, supernatants from smoker macrophages had obvious cathepsin B-like activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose was to study whether procaterol, a beta 2-stimulator, facilitated mucociliary transport on the ciliated airways in the human lungs. From immediately after inhalation of [99mTc]albumin aerosol, radioactivity of the thorax was continuously measured anteriorly by a gamma camera with the examinee in the supine position; the data were sequentially stored in a computer in 10-s frame mode. Three puffs (30 micrograms) of procaterol were inhaled from a metered dose inhaler at 60 min in the same supine position, and measurement of radioactivity was continued for 30 min more. Spirometry was performed before and after the measurement of radioactivity. A group of 8 normal subjects and 34 patients with various lung diseases, including 6 with bronchial asthma in remission, were studied. In addition to observation of mucus transport on the large airways by radioaerosol inhalation lung cinescintigraphy, the time-activity curve from the right lung was evaluated and the quantitative parameters for evaluating mucociliary clearance were calculated for the right lung. Following inhalation of procaterol, there were neither significant acceleration in mucus transport on the large airways by cinescintigraphy nor significant changes in the slope of time-activity curves. Quantitative parameters did not show any significant changes either, although spirometry indicated significant bronchodilation. We conclude that three puffs of inhaled procaterol neither necessarily accelerate mucus transport nor facilitate mucociliary clearance in the human lung.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand blood flow and edema formation in the lung, anatomic evidence for venous sphincters was sought by a scanning electron microscopic investigation of vascular casts in the rat. In the first study, indentations in the casts of veins and arteries were compared. Casts of the pulmonary veins had narrow (1 to 3 microns) circumferential constrictions about every 30 microns in length (range 20 to 50 microns) and before and after accepting tributaries. Most arteries had no constriction. Infrequently, arterial narrowing occurred over long distances (greater than 30 microns). To determine if these indentations could be altered by a neural stimulus, a second study tried to cast the pulmonary microcirculation after the rats were given a blow to the head, but was unsuccessful. In a third study, the pulmonary vasculature of anesthetized rats was cleared and cast. As the resin began to harden and the animals' circulation ceased, half the animals were given a sharp blow on the head. The casts of the veins in the animals that received the blow had deeper bands than the control animals (p less than 0.001). Pulmonary veins have annular constrictions (sphincters) that are strategically located to influence blood flow. They deepen in response to the neural discharge of a head blow and should be considered in the study of neurogenic pulmonary edema.\r"

Three major groups based on histologic patterns were identified: bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Patients with BOOP had a more favorable prognosis than did patients with UIP. Patients with DAD had a uniformly poor prognosis. One patient had a cellular interstitial pneumonia and did well. Histologic subclassification of the interstitial lung disease proved to be a better predictor of survival than did the radiographic appearance or the clinical presentation. These findings suggest that there is a broader range of histologic findings in polymyositis-dermatomyositis than is suggested in the literature and subclassification may be useful for prognosis.\r"

When the culture filtrate antigen of T. cutaneum was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose, two peaks of polysaccharide, fractions A and B, were obtained. Fraction B was highly reactive to the specific IgG and IgA antibodies in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from sensitized rabbits, whereas fraction A was mainly reactive to the IgG antibodies. When the rabbits sensitized by intratracheal injection with the particulate antigen of T. cutaneum were challenged intratracheally by these antigenic fractions, fraction B induced granulomatous alveolitis, but fraction A induced alveolitis rather than granuloma. Lymphocytes of the mediastinal lymph nodes responded prominently to fraction B, but less to fraction A, as assessed by proliferative response. Each of the fractions B obtained from two strains of different serotypes (TIMM 1573, serotype I and TIMM 1318, serotype II) was reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to the serum samples from the rabbits sensitized with homologous antigen, but far less to that from the rabbits sensitized with heterologous antigen, that is, the antigenic specificity of fraction B was related to the serotype of T. cutaneum. Fractionation by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B revealed that the molecular weight of the antigenic components in fraction B was larger than 1,000,000 and that the components consisted mainly of polysaccharide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although it is currently assumed the optimal effect will occur when administered surfactant is distributed homogeneously throughout the lung, little is known of the influence of variables inherent in the administration procedure on subsequent distribution. To address this question, we studied the effect of the volume size in which the surfactant is suspended for instillation, and demonstrated a marked relationship in the normal rabbit lung between this volume and the subsequent homogeneity of surfactant distribution. In the rabbit lung that was acutely injured by oleic acid, this relationship was not evident. Concentration of administered surfactant was not demonstrated to be of major influence on its distribution after administration. Our results focus attention on the importance of parameters of the administration procedure, and also demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques used for determination of surfactant distribution.\r"

The contractile responses were monitored by three strain gauges connected to the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the trachea. The mucosa was either left intact (M+) or removed from the membranous part by dissection (M-). The successive decrease in contractile responses was studied for 60 min using repeated DNS and for a further 60 min using alternating EFS and DNS. During the first period, in which DNS alone was used, there was a significantly more pronounced decrease in the M+ preparation compared with the M-. This effect was most prominent in the proximal part of the trachea and was not blocked by indomethacin. During the subsequent stimulation period in which alternating EFS and DNS were used, the rate of decrease was significantly greater in all segments. In this phase, however, the inhibitory mucosa-dependent effect was significantly attenuated by indomethacin treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the mucosa-dependent inhibition or relaxation in ferret trachea is mediated by both a prostanoid and a nonprostanoid factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, patients were not blinded to the delivery technique used, introducing a potential source of bias. The purpose of this study was to compare exercise tolerance during nasal cannula and transtracheal delivery using a randomized double-blinded technique. Subjects (n = 11) performed 12-min walks on the same day while receiving nasal cannula and transtracheal delivery. Nine of 11 subjects walked farther with transtracheal delivery, a significant increase (p less than 0.01). Mean increase in walk distance was 95 +/- 86 feet. In addition, a trend was seen toward greater improvement in walk distance with greater flows through the catheter (r = 0.58, p less than 0.06). Time into the walk when desaturation (SaO2 less than 90%) first occurred was not significantly different. We conclude that exercise tolerance improves when oxygen is delivered by transtracheal catheter. This improvement is unrelated to an increase in SaO2. We speculate that the increase in exercise tolerance may be related to other physiologic effects of flow through the catheter.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective incidence cohort study. SETTING: All herpes simplex virus isolates cultured over 1 year from patients followed at a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive herpes simplex virus isolates were collected from 207 patients, including immunocompetent patients, patients with malignancy, neonates, bone marrow and organ transplant recipients, and patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A rapid nucleic acid hybridization method was used to assess susceptibility to acyclovir. Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex viruses were recovered from 7 of 148 immunocompromised patients (4.7%) but from none of 59 immunocompetent hosts. Clinical disease was found in all 7 patients with resistant herpes simplex virus and was more severe in pediatric patients. All resistant isolates were from acyclovir-treated patients and had absent or altered thymidine kinase activity by plaque autoradiography. CONCLUSION: Herpes simplex virus resistant to acyclovir arises relatively frequently in immunocompromised patients and may cause serious disease. Rapid detection of resistance permits antiviral therapy to be individualized. Antiviral susceptibility testing to monitor viral resistance should be encouraged, especially in tertiary care settings.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if image magnification from ametropia or other factors required correction in the photogrammetric diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia, the following variables were studied using two standard 30 degrees field fundus cameras (Zeiss FF-3 and Kowa RC-2): (1) distance between the camera and the subject--variations in this distance do not change the image size; (2) decentration of the camera (i.e., decentration of the optic disc image within the field)--no effect was found using the Kowa camera, but in the Zeiss, a 2% (0.07 mm) increase in disc image size was found for each mm of optic disc decentration in the field; (3) ametropia, refractive experimental (induced in one subject with soft contact lenses, from +8.00 diopters (D) to -8.00D)--no significant change in image size was found (In addition, in 50 healthy adult eyes with various refractive errors, including ten with uncorrected aphakia, there was no significant difference found for the size of the optic nerve in different refractive ametropias. No correction factor was necessary for aphakia or for other refractive ametropias); and (4) ametropia, axial--axial myopia showed minor but significant magnification: a linear increase in the horizontal diameter of the optic disc image of 2% (0.07 mm) was found for each diopter of axial ametropia exceeding 3D. There was insufficient data for axial hyperopia. These magnification factors should be applied when measuring the optic disc on 35-mm transparencies to make a diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen patients were either homosexual men or intravenous drug abusers. Although 13 patients had AIDS-related complex, no patients met the Centers for Disease Control criteria for AIDS before their ophthalmologic examination. In all 18 cases, the diagnosis of severe immunodeficiency suggestive of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was made by the ophthalmologist. These ophthalmologic findings included five patients with asymptomatic retinal cotton-wool patches, two patients with endogenous Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial endophthalmitis, and 11 cases of isolated cytomegalovirus retinitis. All patients were ambulatory outpatients at the time of ophthalmologic examination. Noninfectious retinopathy and intraocular opportunistic infections suggest the diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS, and the ophthalmologist may play an important role in early diagnosis of this disease.\r"

Four of these dogs had the sympathetic cervical trunk (SCT) implanted into the right PCA muscle, and the two remaining dogs served as denervated controls. Four months later all dogs underwent videolaryngoscopy, electromyography, and electrical stimulation of the SCT. The PCA muscles were excised, sectioned, and stained for glycogen and ATPase. All four experimental PCA muscles demonstrated electrically evoked abduction and tonic electromyographic activity. In two of the specimens, staining (ATPase and PAS) revealed areas of reinnervation with fiber type grouping and glycogen depletion. These results are consistent with the successful reinnervation of the PCA muscle. Further refinement of this technique could be of benefit to patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis.\r"

A simple stent was devised to open the nasal valve area during anterior mask rhinomanometry. Three groups of subjects were studied with and without the stent. These groups were 1) patients with anatomic findings of nasal valve obstruction, 2) normal control subjects, and 3) normal control subjects with artificially created midseptal nasal obstructions. At peak inspiration the median decrease in resistance with the stent in place when compared to nonstented values was 0.91 Pa.cm-3.s-1 for group 1, 0.27 Pa.cm-3.s-1 for group 2, and 0.25 Pa.cm-3.s-1 for group 3. Comparisons using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test had a significance level of p less than .001. An easily fashioned, well-tolerated nasal valve stent can be readily incorporated in anterior mask rhinomanometry technique. With use of the stent, nasal valve obstruction can be accurately diagnosed and quantitated.\r"

The clearance rate was significantly lower in ears with effusion than in those without. A significant negative correlation was observed between clearance rate and dynamic viscosity at dynamic viscosities above 2 poise. It is concluded that ears with effusion have significantly lower mucociliary clearance than those without, and that the viscosity of the effusions plays an important role in the mucociliary dysfunction in OME.\r"

Isometric muscle force was recorded from a transducer attached to the section of the thyroid cartilage on which the muscle inserted. Twitch contractions were recorded during supramaximal indirect electrical stimulation by DC pulses for at least 30 minutes. At 5 pulses per second (p/s), potentiation was observed in all records, peaking at an average of 7.5 minutes after stimulation onset. At 10 p/s, the peak of the potentiated average trace was earlier. One third of these records did not show potentiation. Where moderate or large potentiation was observed, the peak twitch tension declined and reached an asymptote above the initial tension, while when potentiation was small or absent, the final force was smaller than initially. Canine vocal fold muscle was observed to be fatigue-resistant, but in phonation other factors may produce fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve patients with photodermatitis for longer than 3 months' duration were identified: 1 patient with chronic photocontact dermatitis, 1 with persistent photosensitivity following exposure to a systemic medication, 6 with persistent light reactivity, and 4 with actinic reticuloid. There were 10 men and 2 women, ranging in age from 27 to 81 years, with a mean age of 62 years. The duration of the eruption ranged from 6 months to 20 years. Persistence of photosensitivity to quinidine, which is analogous to persistent light reactivity, was documented in 1 patient, and evolution from photocontact dermatitis to actinic reticuloid was observed in 2 others. These data, along with those reported in the literature, indicate that chronic photocontact dermatitis, persistent photosensitivity to systemic agents, persistent light reactivity, photosensitive eczema, and actinic reticuloid should be considered as entities occurring along a continuum, and the term \"chronic actinic dermatitis\" is suggested to refer to these entities. Eight (67%) of the 12 patients had skin type VI and 2 others (17%) had skin type V, percentages markedly higher than those of the general patient population, demonstrating that chronic actinic dermatitis is not uncommon among individuals with dark skin.\r"

One hypothesis supports fibroblast stimulation for production of excess amounts of collagen by factors present in the blood or released by cells composing inflammatory tissue infiltrates. Increased numbers of mast cells are present in the involved skin of patients with systemic sclerosis, and histamine has been thought to be a possible mediator of fibrosis in this and other fibrotic conditions. We therefore measured plasma histamine levels in 32 patients with systemic sclerosis and found elevated levels in 18 patients (56%). Elevated plasma histamine levels were more common in patients with diffuse disease (74%), in contrast to limited disease (31%). The degree of clinical activity and the duration of disease could not be correlated with histamine levels.\r"

The results of treatment with topical and intralesional corticosteroids, as well as systemic therapy with corticosteroids, salicylates, aspirin, niacinamide, and chloroquine, have been generally disappointing. We describe five patients with generalized granuloma annulare of several years' duration who were treated with oral psoralen plus ultraviolet A irradiation. Lesions were present on the extremities, buttocks, and trunk in the form of macules, papules, and plaques. One patient also had perforating lesions on her thighs. Flattening of the lesions with decreased erythema and pigmentation was noted as early as 1 month after initiation of treatment. Complete clearance was achieved in all patients. Maintenance therapy has been required, resulting in prolonged disease-free intervals. Although the mechanism of action of oral psoralen plus ultraviolet A irradiation in granuloma annulare is unclear, one possibility is selective elimination of the cells that are responsible for initiating the disease.\r"

Immunohistochemically, biopsy specimens taken from the lesional skin demonstrated an infiltrate of the cells bearing the natural killer cell phenotype, indicating a role of these cells in the development of the abnormal skin reactions to mosquito bites and other systemic manifestations. Our case suggests that natural killer cell lymphocytosis may show severe hypersensitivity to mosquito bites as the most outstanding manifestation.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the incidence of morbidity and mortality after common duct exploration no longer justifies its use in patients with a gallbladder in situ. Therefore endoscopic sphincterotomy has been advocated for removal of common duct stones before cholecystectomy in selected patients. The purpose of this study was to determine our current rate of retained common duct stones and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with common duct exploration. Charts of 100 consecutive patients who underwent cholecystectomy and common duct exploration from January 1982 through December 1986 were reviewed. Indications for duct exploration included jaundice, dilated common bile duct, gallstone pancreatitis, multiple small stones, and abnormal intraoperative cholangiogram. Common duct exploration was done by manual technique or choledochoscopy, as determined by the surgeon's preference. Only two patients required duodenotomy for extraction of difficult stones. There were no deaths in this series of consecutive common duct exploration. The total morbidity rate was 15.7%, which included a 5.3% incidence of retained common duct stones. There was a 7.4% major complication rate, including deep vein thrombosis, bleeding gastric ulcer, and pneumonia. The remaining complications were minor and did not prolong hospitalization. There was one wound infection and no postoperative pancreatitis. None of the complications were directly attributable to choledochotomy or duct exploration. All retained common duct stones were removed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or by angiographic basket and did not require reoperation. It is concluded that operative common duct exploration not requiring duodenotomy is safe and does not appreciably increase the incidence of complications after cholecystectomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy continues to be the preferable alternative to operative common duct exploration for patients with retained common duct stones.\r"

Human breast cancer MX-1, UM-1, and esophageal cancer ES-4 were transplanted to the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice. Human EGF (2 micrograms) was injected locally into the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the tumor. The tumor growth was followed for 7 days after treatment, and the estimated tumor weight, tumor doubling time, tumor growth curve, tumor growth rate, and results from histologic examination were used to evaluate the effects of EGF on the growth of tumors. We investigated the dose effect on the growth of these tumors using various concentrations of EGF. We also studied the EGF receptor status of these transplanted tumors and its effect on the influence of EGF treatment. A growth-inhibitory effect was noted in these three tumors with 2 micrograms of EGF. EGF inhibited growth of ES-4 tumor in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 2 ng of EGF or saline did not inhibit growth. However treatment with 20 ng or 200 ng of EGF inhibited growth in proportion to the concentrations. All tumors were positive by the EGF receptor binding assay. The efficacy of EGF treatment correlated with EGF receptor levels. EGF receptor levels were also influenced by EGF treatment. These results suggest that human EGF showed an anti-tumor effect on MX-1 and UM-1 breast cancer and also on ES-4 esophageal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "To test our hypothesis that supplemental vitamin A would mitigate the impaired healing that occurs in tumor-bearing animals, six groups of C3H mice, eight per group, eating a standard commercial mouse chow ad libitum that supports normal growth, reproduction, and longevity were innoculated with 200,000 C3HBA cells. When tumors measured approximately 6 mm in diameter, the mice were anesthesized and wounded (dorsal skin incisions and subcutaneous polyvinyl alcohol sponges). Twenty-four hours later, two groups (one continued on the chow and the other started on the chow supplemented with 150,000 IU vitamin A/kg chow) underwent local tumor irradiation; two groups, one ingesting the chow, the other the vitamin A supplemented chow, were started on cyclophosphamide therapy; two groups, one ingesting the chow, the other the vitamin A supplemented chow, received neither local tumor irradiation nor cyclophosphamide therapy. An additional two groups ingesting the chow, one group neither innoculated with tumor nor wounded, the other wounded by not innoculated, served as controls. Wound breaking strength and sponge reparative collagen accumulation (assessed by hydroxyproline proline measurement) were used as indicators of wound healing. The mice were killed 12 days after wounding. Tumor presence decreased wound breaking strength and sponge hydroxyproline content; these effects were largely negated by supplemental vitamin A. Local tumor irradiation diminished the adverse effect of tumor on sponge reparative collagen content but to a lesser extent than the supplemental vitamin A. Supplemental vitamin A added to the irradiation effect on healing but irradiation did not add to the vitamin A effect. Cyclophosphamide, a systemic radiomimetic anti-tumor agent, did not alter the impaired wound healing of the tumor-bearing mice. Supplemental vitamin A mitigated the impaired wound healing in the cyclophosphamide-treated tumor-bearing mice. Supplemental vitamin A also moderated the effects of wounding, tumor, and tumor therapies (local irradiation and cyclophosphamide) on the increase in adrenal size, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and thymic involution (except the last was not moderated in the cyclophosphamide-treated tumor-bearing rats). The splenic enlargement in the untreated tumor-bearing wounded rats and in those treated with cyclophosphamide was lessened by supplemental vitamin A. We hypothesize that these anti-stress effects of vitamin A underlie, in part, its action in mitigating the impaired wound healing of tumor-bearing mice, including those treated by local irradiation or cyclophosphamide. These findings have implications for the care of patients with malignant tumors.\r"

The effect of exogenous TGF-beta form 2 on dermal wounds healing by secondary intent was investigated using a sponge composed of collagen and heparin as a delivery vehicle. Longitudinal lenticular-shaped wounds on the dorsum of adult guinea pigs were treated at the time of wounding with delivery vehicle containing 0.5, 1, or 5 micrograms of purified, bovine bone-derived TGF-beta 2, and were compared with wounds that received vehicle only or were untreated. At days 8 and 14 the amount of connective tissue in the wounds and the extent of epithelialization were determined by histomorphometric methods, and wound breaking strength was determined. At day 8, but not at day 14, wounds treated with 1 or 5 micrograms of TGF-beta 2 contained a significantly higher proportion of connective tissue than did wounds treated with vehicle only, and they also exhibited higher wound strength. No effect on wound size or re-epithelialization was detected. The observations provide evidence that a single treatment with exogenous TGF-beta 2 delivered in collagen/heparin sponge vehicle can accelerate repair in guinea pig dermal wounds allowed to heal by secondary intent.\r"

The liver regeneration rate 72 hours after hepatectomy in Groups FA and F, and the plasma FN levels at 24 and 72 hours following hepatectomy in groups with FN, were significantly higher than that of the control group. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA and the phagocytic index of the reticuloendothelial system at 24 hours in Groups FA and F, and the mitotic index at 72 hours after hepatectomy in Group FA were significantly increased as compared to the control. But the supplementation of 20 mg/kg of indomethacin to the 4 groups resulted in significant suppression of 3H-thymidine uptake 24 hours after hepatectomy. Moreover, plasma fibronectin levels in rats correlated well with the phagocytic index and DNA synthesis 24 hours following partial hepatectomy. These results suggest that fibronectin may act as an activator of the reticuloendothelial system, related to prostaglandins, in the process of liver regeneration.\r"

Small-volume hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) resuscitation has been used for effective treatment of several types of shock. In this study isolated coronary perfused guinea pig hearts were used to determine if HSD improved left ventricular contractile response to burn injuries. Parameters measured included left ventricular pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of LVP rise (+dP/dt max) and fall (-dP/dt max) at a constant preload. Third-degree scald burns comprising 45% of total body surface area (burn groups, N = 75), or 0% for controls (group 1, N = 25) were produced using a template device. In group 2, 25 burned guinea pigs were not fluid resuscitated and served as untreated burns; 20 burns were resuscitated with 4 mL lactated Ringer's (LR) solution/kg/% burn for 24 hours (group 3); additional burn groups were treated with an initial bolus of HSD (4 mL/kg, 2400 mOsm, sodium chloride, 6% dextran 70) followed by either 1, 2, or 4 mL LR/kg/% burn over 24 hours (groups 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Untreated burn injury significantly impaired cardiac function, as indicated by a fall in LVP (from 88 +/- 3 to 68 +/- 4 mmHg; p = 0.01) and +/- dP/dt max (from 1352 +/- 50 to 1261 +/- 90 and from 1150 +/- 35 to 993 +/- 59; p = 0.01, respectively) and a downward shift of LV function curves from those obtained from control hearts. Compared to untreated burns, hearts from burned animals treated with LR alone showed no significant improvement in cardiac function. However hearts from burned animals treated with HSD + 1 mL LR/kg/% burn had significantly higher LVP (79 +/- 4 vs. 68 +/- 4 mmHg, p = 0.01) and +/- dP/dt max (+dP/dt: 1387 +/- 60 vs. 1261 +/- 90 mmHg/sc, p = 0.01; -dP/dt: 1079 +/- 50 vs. 993 +/- 59 mmHg/sc, p = 0.01) than hearts from untreated burned animals and generated left ventricular function curves comparable to those calculated for hearts from control animals. Mortality 24 hours after burn was 29% for untreated burns was 0% for control animals, as well as for groups treated with the Parkland formula or HSD plus 1 or 2 mL/kg/% burn lactated Ringer's. The only deaths after treatment occurred in those animals given HSD plus 4 mL/kg/% burn, Parkland formula (17% mortality).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-seven patients with a primary complaint of persistent cough, wheezing, and/or recurrent pneumonia were evaluated for the presence of occult gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fifty-four patients (70%) had increased esophageal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring of the distal esophagus. In 28% of these patients the respiratory symptoms were thought to be due to aspiration because they occurred during or within 3 minutes after a reflux episode. In the other patients, the respiratory symptoms were either induced by or were unrelated to reflux episodes. The number of respiratory symptoms reported by the patients with increased esophageal acid exposure was directly related to the presence of a nonspecific esophageal motility abnormality (p less than 0.05). This suggested that a motility disorder contributes to aspiration by promoting the aboral flow of refluxed gastric juice. Seventeen patients with increased esophageal acid exposure had an antireflux operation to relieve their respiratory complaints. Patients whose respiratory symptoms induced reflux episodes were not helped by the procedure. Of the other patients, symptoms were abolished by the procedure only in those with normal esophageal motility. It is concluded that the majority of patients suffering from chronic unexplained respiratory symptoms have occult gastroesophageal reflux disease, but only a minority of them are helped by surgery. Carefully performed esophageal function studies are needed to select those patients who will benefit from a surgical antireflux procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Dextran of different molecular weight (Dx 40, Dx 60/70) has often been evaluated as adjunct treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis. A beneficial effect has been documented by a decrease in its lethality. However, the mechanism of action is poorly understood. A specific effect on the pancreatic microcirculation generally has not been documented and differentiation from unspecific improvement of pancreatic blood flow due to volume expansion has been difficult. This investigation was designed to quantify the effect of dextran on the impairment of pancreatic microcirculation during acute biliary pancreatitis by means of intravital microscopy. Dextran 60 (Dx 60, molecular weight 60,000) was chosen in light of the increase in vascular permeability in the early stage of pancreatitis as demonstrated previously in the same model. Isovolemic hemodilution, i.e., exchange of whole blood for Dx 60 was used as a mode of administration to achieve instantaneous onset of therapy without changes in intravascular volume. In the control group a progressive reduction of pancreatic capillary perfusion commenced 30 minutes after induction of acute pancreatitis, resulting in cessation of nutritive tissue perfusion after 3 hours. In the animals subjected to hemodilution, stabilization of the pancreatic microcirculation was accomplished throughout the observation period of 6 hours. Because volume-related effects could be excluded by the protocol and by monitoring central venous pressure and hematocrit, a specific effect of hemodilution with DX 60 on the pancreatic microcirculation is indicated by our results.\r"

  ".W": "To apply the potential energy source available from skeletal muscle in cardiac assistance, we developed an implantable counterpulsation assist system. This study reports the results using this implantable counterpulsation assist system in an acute in vivo animal model. Twelve dogs had a dual-chambered, extraaortic counter-pulsation pump anastomosed in parallel to the thoracic aorta. The left latissimus dorsi muscle was used to power the pump. A newly developed implantable stimulator was used to make the muscle contract in synchrony with the diastolic phase. The unique feature of this stimulator is its ability to adjust timing of muscle contraction according to changing heart rates. The stimulator is also able to detect arrhythmias, and as a safety measure, shuts down until a normal rhythm is resumed. During counterpulsation assist with the implantable counterpulsation assist system, diastolic pressure increased an average of 34 mm Hg from baseline, equivalent to a 69% augmentation. Systolic peak pressure decreased an average of 10 mm Hg, equivalent to an 11% unloading. With induced heart rate changes, the implantable counterpulsation assist system readjusted its timing, maintaining optimal counterpulsation without systolic interference. Induced ventricular tachycardia resulted in immediate shutdown of the stimulator until resumption of a normal rhythm. The feasibility of using an intraaortic balloon pump console as back-up was also demonstrated. Excellent counterpulsation was obtained with either muscle power or balloon pump console. We conclude that the implantable counterpulsation assist system can provide effective counterpulsation assist and has the potential for continuous cardiac support.\r"

Twenty-eight patients had chest wall resection for high-grade primary, metastatic, or recurrent sarcoma. In all patients, resection with selective reconstruction of the bony thorax was performed without operative mortality. Since 1980, only patients with four or more ribs resected have had selective bony reconstruction. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 132 months (median follow-up, 42 months). All deaths were related to sarcoma recurrence. The overall actuarial survival rate was 85% at 1 year, 65% at 3 years, and 59% at more than 5 years. The overall actuarial proportion without disease recurrence was 64% at 1 year, 52% at 3 years, and 40% at more than 5 years. There was no significant difference in overall or disease-free survival for patients with primary, metastatic, or recurrent tumors. The most important prognostic factors were positive margins and concomitant pulmonary resection for synchronous lung metastases. These data support aggressive resection to obtain pathologically tumor-free margins for chest wall sarcomas, whether primary, metastatic or recurrent. Reconstruction can be individualized based on the extent of resection.\r"

  ".W": "The porcine bioprosthetic valve was used in 440 patients having isolated mitral valve replacement (MVR), 522 patients having isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), and 88 patients having MVR + AVR between 1974 and 1981. Patients with associated surgical procedures were excluded. Mean follow-up was 8.3 years. At 10 years, there was no difference in patient survival between those having AVR and those having MVR. Reoperations were performed on 192 patients. Endocarditis was the reason for reoperation in 3.7% of patients who had MVR and 10.6% of those who had AVR. Structural valve degeneration was the reason for reoperation in 89.7% of MVR patients and 78.8% of AVR patients (p = 0.04). Hospital mortality among patients having valve reoperations was 4.7%. At 10 years, the freedom from valve reoperation for all causes and from structural valve degeneration was significantly better for the AVR group than the MVR group (74% +/- 3% versus 61% +/- 4%, p = 0.004; and 79% +/- 3% versus 63% +/- 4%, p = 0.0006, respectively). For patients in their 60s, the 10-year freedom from reoperation was 92% +/- 2% for AVR and 80% +/- 6% for MVR (p = not significant). At 10 years, freedom from cardiac-related death and valve reoperation was best for both MVR and AVR patients in their 60s. Patients 70 years old or older rarely had reoperation but died before valve failure occurred. The 10-year freedom from all major valve-related events (cardiac-related death, reoperation, thromboembolism, endocarditis, and anticoagulant-related bleeding) was practically the same for both MVR and AVR patients (48% +/- 3% versus 49% +/- 3%, respectively). The porcine bioprosthetic valve is the valve of choice only for patients 60 years old or older. Patients in their 70s have an extremely low rate of reoperation but a high rate of cardiac-related death and do not outlive the prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred forty-four veterans, with a mean age of 62.4 years, mainly asymptomatic (pulmonary), were admitted generally for other disease or pension evaluation and underwent lobectomy (131), segmentectomy (107), or wedge resection (6) for T1 N0 M0 lung cancer between 1966 and 1988. Conservative resection was preferred during the past decade. The average lesion diameter was 2 cm. Thirty-day mortality was 2.9%, similar for the three procedures. Absolute 5-year survival, 51%, was 78% if only deaths from the initial lesion are considered; 19% died of comorbidity, and 8% died of second lung cancers. Routine preoperative computed tomographic staging and intraoperative sampling of even normal-sized hilar and mediastinal nodes, conducted after 1982, improved survival (p less than 0.006). Patients with lesions less than 2 cm in diameter (146) did better (p less than 0.04), and those with squamous tumors improved similarly (p less than 0.02). Lesions that communicated with a bronchus (88) were more malignant than those (156) that did not (p less than 0.02), because from that locus undifferentiated nonsquamous tumors metastasized widely. These results suggest that the T1 N0 M0 category is not uniform. Histology, size, and location in the lung are significant variables. Results of conservative resection were similar or better than those of lobectomy. The latter was used more in deep-seated lesions, however, when major intersegmental planes were transgressed, and before modern preoperative and intraoperative staging. The T1 N0 M0 category should include lesions 2 cm or less in diameter as a discrete entity.\r"

Changing practice patterns have had a negative impact on surgical results. This evolution in cardiac surgical practice has important implications related to peer review and quality-assurance screening, diagnosis-related group reimbursement, and reporting of surgical outcomes to governmental agencies.\r"

Twenty patients were selected to receive nicardipine cardioplegia and 13 patients received a standard potassium cardioplegia, serving as a control group. Nicardipine cardioplegia provided better cardiac performance in the early postoperative period and reduced release of the MB isozyme of creatine kinase, as determined during a 48-hour postoperative period.

Myocardial protection consisted of cold blood potassium cardioplegia, topical ice slush, and moderate (28 degrees C) systemic hypothermia. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 (18 patients) received verapamil (0.1 mg/kg up to 10 mg) intravenously three to five minutes before aortic cross-clamping; group 2 (22 patients) did not (control). Myocardial injury was assessed by cumulative release of the cardiac-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB) after release of the aortic cross-clamp. Release of CK-MB was significantly lower in the verapamil group (44.9 +/- 6.2 versus 72.2 +/- 9.0 IU at 24.5 hours, p = 0.005). Calculated total infarct size was also lower in the verapamil group (6.0 +/- 0.9 versus 8.9 +/- 1.0 g-Eq, p = 0.035). Individual CK-MB release curves showed either one or two peaks. The two-peak pattern was more frequent in control patients (18 of 21 control patients versus 6 of 18 verapamil patients, p = 0.001) and was associated with a larger infarct size. Atrioventricular pacing was not required in any verapamil patient, but was needed in 1 control patient. We conclude that verapamil administered before aortic cross-clamping protects against myocardial injury during coronary artery bypass grafting with no increase in the incidence of atrioventricular block.\r"

For anticoagulation before cardiopulmonary bypass, we administered a single dose of heparin (300 U/kg) to 193 patients and measured ACT and heparin levels at intervals after administration. No additional heparin was administered to any patient. Clot formation in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and excessive postoperative chest tube drainage were considered outcomes indicating inadequate anticoagulation. Cardiopulmonary bypass averaged 59 +/- 23 minutes (range, 30 to 138 minutes). Activated coagulation time values at every sampling period were normally distributed. In 51 patients (26.4%) ACT values were less than 400 seconds, including 4 less than 300 seconds, at some sampling time after heparinization. Patients with low ACT values did not bleed more postoperatively than those with high ACT values, nor was bleeding related to heparin level. No clots were found in any perfusion circuit. We conclude that a minimum ACT value for adequacy of heparinization is not yet defined but that it is less than 400 seconds.\r"

There were 35 female and 19 male patients with a mean age of 48 +/- 14 years (range, 7 to 68 years). Four patients were asymptomatic; the others were seen mostly with exertional dyspnea, palpitation, signs of systemic illness, and syncopal episodes. Before operation, embolic episodes occurred in 13 patients with a left atrial myxoma. There were two early (3.7%) and two late deaths (3.8). Actuarial survival at 20 years is 91% +/- 4%, and most of the current survivors are asymptomatic at a mean follow-up of 6.5 +/- 5 years (range, 0.2 year to 20 years). Noninvasive reevaluation was performed with echocardiographic studies in 44 patients and 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring in 34. No instances of tumor recurrence were observed, and there was a low incidence of major supraventricular arrhythmias late postoperatively. We conclude that excision of intracardiac myxomas is curative and long-term survival is excellent. The transseptal approach provides adequate exposure and allows complete removal of the tumor regardless of its location.\r"

We noted an association between bacteremias and sternal wound complications in these patients. A review of 835 consecutive coronary bypass patients showed a 3.2% incidence of bacteremia and a 1.9% incidence of deep and superficial sternal wound infection. The sternal wound was the most common source of bacteremia, accounting for 59% of the infections. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was responsible for one half of the sternal wound infections. Often, a positive blood culture was the first manifestation of wound infection, occurring before local signs were manifest. We recommend multiple blood cultures in postoperative coronary bypass patients with pronounced fever. If no source of infection can be identified, sternal wound aspirate may be revealing. Appropriate early wound management can then be carried out, maximizing chances for good recovery.\r"

The overall infection rate was 2.1%, and the mortality rate in the patients with sternal infection or dehiscence was 16.2%. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prolonged intensive care unit stay, respiratory failure, connective tissue disease, and male sex were significantly higher in the group with sternal infection or dehiscence (p less than 0.05). Advanced age and low cardiac output episodes were more frequent in this group, but only approached statistical significance. Although several risk factors may have been interrelated, male sex and the presence of pulmonary disease were statistically independent predictors of sternal wound infection. Risk factors may be helpful in identifying high-risk patients for additional prophylactic measures.\r"

We found previously that in hospitalized men the prevalence of gynecomastia was correlated with body mass index and with age. The mean body mass index and the prevalence of gynecomastia in the cirrhotic subjects (nonedematous) did not differ from those in the overall population. Because more severely cirrhotic subjects with ascites, peripheral edema, or both usually are thin, we examined 18 more severely cirrhotic subjects and 18 nonobese (mean body mass index, 20.9 +/- 0.6 kg/m2), age-matched control subjects for the prevalence of palpable gynecomastia. Total testosterone, free testosterone, total estrogen, and estradiol concentrations also were measured. Fifty percent of the control subjects had gynecomastia. Breast tissue diameter was correlated with body mass index. The prevalence of gynecomastia in the cirrhotic subjects was 44%. In these subjects no significant correlation was noted between breast tissue diameter and body mass index, presumably because the body mass index was increased owing to fluid retention. The results could not be accounted for based on medications. Serum free testosterone concentrations were lower in the cirrhotic patients than in the controls (0.11 +/- 0.02 vs 0.22 +/- 0.03 nmol/L). The total estrogen-free testosterone ratio was higher in cirrhotic patients (10.3 +/- 2.5 vs 2.6 +/- 0.5), as was the estradiol-free testosterone ratio (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs 0.5 +/- 0.1). These ratios did not differ significantly in cirrhotic subjects with and without gynecomastia. Therefore, these data indicate that factors other than the estrogen-testosterone ratio are playing a role in the development of gynecomastia in both cirrhotic subjects and controls or that breast tissue sensitivity to an elevated estrogen-testosterone ratio is highly varible.\r"

This study investigated the reliability and validity of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) for assessing clinical performance of internal medicine residents. Residents were required to take a 17-patient OSCE in their first and second year. Reliability of the OSCE was 0.40. Validity studies indicated second-year students were significantly better than third-year students for five of six OSCE skill scores; first-year students were significantly better for three scores. Resident's scores for diagnosis, plan, and total significantly increased on their second OSCE. Generally faculty overall ratings of residents' clinical performance did not correlate with OSCE scores. American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination scores were consistently positively correlated only with diagnosis. This 17-case OSCE is a feasible method for obtaining moderately reliable, valid data not available from other sources about the clinical performance of residents. More cases should be added to increase its reliability.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of familial dyslipidemia syndromes was determined from blood tests in 33 objectively ascertained families with early coronary heart disease (CHD) (two or more siblings with CHD by the age of 55 years). Three fourths of persons with early CHD in these families had 90th percentile lipid abnormalities (cholesterol level at or above the 90th percentile, triglyceride level at or above the 90th percentile, and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level at or less than the 10th percentile). The HDL-C and triglyceride abnormalities were twice as common as low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol abnormalities. The most common syndromes found were familial combined hyperlipidemia (36% to 48% of families with CHD), familial dyslipidemic hypertension (21% to 54% of families with CHD), and isolated low levels of HDL-C (15%), with overlapping familial dyslipidemic hypertension with familial combined hyperlipidemia and low-level HDL-C. Well-defined monogenic syndromes were uncommon: familial hypercholesterolemia being 3% and familial type III hyperlipidemia, 3%. Another 15% of families with CHD had no lipid abnormalities at the 90th percentile. Physicians should learn to recognize and treat these common familial syndromes before the onset of CHD by evaluating family history and all three standard blood lipid determinations. Failure to recognize and treat them leaves affected family members at high risk of premature CHD.\r"

  ".U": "90179355\r", 
  ".W": "Recommendations for the treatment of insulin reactions are based more on habit than data. We investigated the efficacy in correcting blood glucose levels and alleviating clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia of seven orally administered carbohydrates--glucose in solution, tablets, and gel; sucrose in solution and tablets; a hydrolized polysaccharide solution; and orange juice--each of which provided 15 g of carbohydrate. Forty-one type I diabetic patients recently treated with insulin agreed to submit to artificially induced hypoglycemia by an intravenous injection of insulin. Corrective therapy was given when patients experienced symptoms and asked for treatment. Mean blood glucose levels 10 minutes after ingestion were found to be similar whether correction was dispensed with the tablets and the solutions of glucose, those of sucrose, or the polysaccharide preparation. However, almost no increment was obtained at this time point with the gel or the fruit juice. Fifteen and 20 minutes after carbohydrate intake, blood glucose levels were higher with the tablet forms than with the solutions, although differences only became signifiant for sucrose. Glycemic responses were again consistently lower with the sucrose gel and the orange juice. Clinical symptoms were alleviated in 14.0 +/- 0.8 minutes (mean +/- SEM) with sucrose and glucose in solution or tablets. We conclude that in moderately severe hypoglycemia, ingestion of 15 g of carbohydrate in the form of glucose or sucrose tablets or as a solution provides an effective therapy; both sugars seem equivalent. Even if sucrose lumps are better recommended in terms of cost and availability, they may not be recommendable in terms of palatability. Glucose gel or orange juice cannot be recommended, at least in light of our experimental procedure and at the dosage used therein.\r"

  ".W": "Snoring was investigated in a survey of respiratory disease in Hispanic-Americans of a New Mexico community. A population-based sample of 1222 adults was studied with questionnaires and measurements of height, weight, and blood pressure. The age-adjusted prevalence of regular loud snoring was 27.8% in men and 15.3% in women. Snoring prevalence increased with age and obesity in both men and women. Cigarette smoking was also associated with snoring, but chronic obstructive lung disease and alcohol consumption were not. Snorers more frequently had hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and excessive daytime sleepiness. In contrast to other studies, after adjustment for confounding factors, there was no effect of snoring on hypertension (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.5), but an effect on myocardial infarction was still demonstrable (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 3.6). The association of snoring with sleepiness suggests that respiratory disturbance of sleep related to upper airway obstruction, such as sleep apnea, occurs more frequently in snorers in this population.\r"

The serum albumin level was not affected by patient age and gender, type of myeloma, and the occurrence of Bence Jones protein, lytic bone lesions, or hypercalcemia, and it was not related to changes in body weight or in liver and renal function. The albumin level, lower in patients with proteinuria, was unrelated to severity of proteinuria. Albumin level correlated significantly with the monoclonal IgG levels, hemoglobin concentration, clinical stage of disease, and estimated body tumor burden. Further analysis indicated the disease stage or the tumor burden as the dominant factor in determining albumin level. An albumin level of 29.0 g/L or less identified unequivocally advanced disease. Practically all patients with stage III myeloma had a serum albumin level of 37.0 g/L or less. Thus, hypoalbuminemia is primarily related to the extent of myeloma proliferation and is therefore of diagnostic and prognostic importance.\r"

We examined the effects of 495 sets of potassium chloride infusions administered to a medical intensive care unit population. The infusion sets consisted of one to eight consecutive individual infusions, each containing 20 mEq of potassium chloride in 100 mL of saline administered. The mean preinfusion potassium level was 3.2 mmol/L, and the mean postinfusion potassium level was 3.9 mmol/L. The mean increment in serum potassium level per 20-mEq infusion was 0.25 mmol/L. No temporally related life-threatening arrhythmias were noted; however, there were 10 instances of mild hyperkalemia. Our data endorse the relative safety of using concentrated (200-mEq/L) potassium chloride infusions at a rate of 20 mEq/h via central or peripheral vein to correct hypokalemia in patients in the intensive care unit.\r"

In the 12-year period from 1975 to 1987, 15,398 patients with Graves' disease receiving treatment with antithyroid drugs were seen at our clinic. Of these, 55 (0.4%) were found to have agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis was defined as a granulocyte count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L or less. In only 12 of the 55 patients was agranulocytosis detected after the occurrence of infection (symptomatic; classic agranulocytosis). The remaining 43 patients were asymptomatic when agranulocytosis was detected during routine white blood cell count monitoring. However, 14 of these 43 patients became symptomatic several days after withdrawal of antithyroid drug treatment despite antimicrobial treatment (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Twenty-nine patients who were treated appropriately had no symptom of infection throughout the course of the disease, despite the absence of or an extremely small number of granulocytes in circulation (asymptomatic). These results suggest that a \"routine monitoring\" of the white blood cell count could be the most effective way of predicting and detecting agranulocytosis due to antithyroid drug treatment.\r"

Blood pressure levels were checked longitudinally for a mean of 6.6 years in 230 subjects to determine their relationship to early diabetic nephropathy as monitored by microalbuminuria. High-normal BP level correlated with the presence of microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria was 2.8 times as common in subjects with high-normal BP levels compared with those subjects with BP levels below the 90th percentile for their age. The elevated microalbumin excretion was primarily associated with high-normal diastolic BP levels. Our data suggest that either microalbuminuria or high-normal BP levels can precede the other. In a logistics model, diastolic BP and mean HbA1 (over 6.6 years) entered the model at similar levels, followed by duration of diabetes. When the influence of mean HbA1 was removed using logistic regression, the diastolic BP level remained a significant associated factor for the presence of microalbuminuria.\r"

Prompt sheets were also attached to all charts to remind physicians to perform these same procedures. One hundred seventy-five patients received the card and the physician prompt sheets on their charts. Two hundred forty-eight patients received only physician's prompt sheet. The card group had significant increases in the performance of influenza vaccinations (47% vs 29%), rectal examination and hemoccult tests (59% vs 46%), Papanicolaou's smears, (30% vs 20%), and physician breast examinations (52% vs 29%). There was not a significant increase in the performance of pneumococcal vaccines (22% vs 24%) or mammography (18% vs 19%). We conclude that patient-carried health maintenance reminder cards are useful in increasing the physician performance of influenza vaccinations, rectal examinations and hemoccult tests, Papanicolaou's smears, and breast examinations.\r"

The majority (66%) preferred that their medical decision making be shared with the physician and/or family. Only 38 patients (39%) could correctly define a \"living will.\" After hearing the definition, 59 patients (61%) thought it was a good idea to ask noncritically ill patients at the time of hospital admission, if they had a living will. Fifty-six patients (58%) said they had discussed resuscitation with their physician, whereas 44 physicians (73%) said they had discussed it with the patient. Only 53 patients (55%) said that they thought their physician understood their wishes. Sixty-five patients (67%) wanted involvement in resuscitation decisions. Forty-eight patients (49%) offered \"quality of life\" reasons for not wanting to be resuscitated. Sixty-four patients (66%) did not think discussing resuscitation was cruel and insensitive. Eighteen physicians (30%) said they were uncomfortable discussing resuscitation with patients. We recommend introducing the topic of resuscitation early in the patient-physician relationship before diminished competency occurs.\r"

Persons aged 25 to 74 years at baseline were reweighed a decade after their initial examination (men, 3727; women, 6135). The incidence of major weight gain was twice as high in women and was highest in persons aged 25 to 34 years (men, 3.9%; women, 8.4%). Initially overweight women aged 25 to 44 years had the highest incidence of major weight gain of any subgroup (14.2%). For person not overweight at baseline (men, 2760; women, 4295), the incidence of becoming overweight was similar in both sexes and was highest in those aged 35 to 44 years (men, 16.3%; women, 13.5%).

In the present analysis, 134 monozygotic and 133 dizygotic male twin pairs (mean age, 63 years) were given three cognitive tests: the Mini-Mental State examination, the Iowa Screening Battery for Mental Decline, and, for comparison, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The primary objective of the analysis was to test for a significant heritable component to performance on these measures. A secondary objective was to determine the extent to which shared variance with significant confounders such as education, age, and depression affects the outcome of the heritability analysis. Results indicate that performance on tests intended to measure cognitive decline in the elderly does have a significant genetic component and that these estimates tend to increase after adjustment for covariates. Heritability estimates adjusted for covariates were 30% for the Iowa Screening score, 60% for the Mini-Mental State score, and 67% for the Digit Symbol Substitution score.\r"

Autopsies were performed in 10 cases: 8 demented patients and 2 nondemented patients. Neuropathologically, Alzheimer-type abnormalities were demonstrated in 9 patients, both demented and nondemented, and combined Alzheimer-type abnormalities with infarctions were demonstrated in 1 patient. In the 14 demented patients who did not show evidence of cerebrovascular or systemic vascular disease, dementia had an early onset and was rapidly progressive (mean age at onset, 51.3 years in the moderately retarded patients and 52.6 years in the severely retarded patients; mean duration of symptoms, respectively, 4.9 and 5.2 years). Cognitive and behavioral decline corresponded to symptoms of dementia of the Alzheimer's type in patients without Down's syndrome, but often were not recognized early. In the present group of patients, there was a remarkably high incidence of gait and speech deterioration. Also, the incidence of epileptic seizures and myoclonus was about eightfold, as compared with dementia of the Alzheimer's type in patients without Down's syndrome.\r"

A family with such a myotonic disorder is described with features that are distinctly different from myotonia congenita and paramyotonia congenita. Five members were affected in three generations. The myotonia fluctuated to an unusual degree. It did not worsen with cold but increased markedly with potassium loading. Muscle weakness never occurred. Analysis of the contraction force of the flexor digitorum muscle showed a unique type of myotonia, namely, exercise-induced delayed-onset myotonia. Microelectrode studies done on one muscle biopsy specimen revealed a normal chloride conductance of the muscle fiber membrane.\r"

Histologic examination of their muscle biopsy specimens showed patterns ranging between centronuclear myopathy and type-1 hypotrophy without central nuclei. Regardless of their gender or the appearance of their biopsy specimens, the children all had a poor outcome. The clinical and biopsy findings in these infants suggest that centronuclear myopathy and type-1 hypotrophy without central nuclei do not represent distinct nosologic entities. It seems more likely that the histologic changes represent abnormalities in fiber size distribution and development, which are nonspecific and which reflect a primary defect at one or more sites in the neuraxis.\r"

We reevaluated the usefulness of the MMSE by studying 85 patients with clinically definite MS who also received an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Although scores on the MMSE were negatively correlated with the number of neuropsychological tests on which patients with MS displayed impairment, the MMSE was not sufficiently sensitive to identify precisely defined dementia in these patients. The MMSE was nonetheless a useful predictor of focal cognitive impairment, particularly in relapsing-remitting patients with relatively minor physical disabilities. Additional analyses suggested strategies for minor modifications of the MMSE that may improve its sensitivity and specificity for identifying dementia while preserving its major advantages as a screening examination: brevity and ease of administration and scoring.\r"

Whether these differences reflect an independent influence of disease type on cognitive performance is uncertain. We used multiple regression techniques to determine how well performance on a number of tasks done poorly by groups of patients with multiple sclerosis could be predicted by disease type and its confounds: age, disease duration, and disability status as well as other demographic variables. Disease types were assigned longitudinally, based on serial neurological examinations at 6-month intervals over a minimum of 2 years. None of the demographic or clinical variables predicted cognitive performance with more than minimal accuracy. These findings fail to provide support for the assertion that disease type is an important independent determinant of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Compressive lesions in each case were documented by myelography. The hand sensory loss was often global, and in some patients the involvement extended proximally as far as the elbows. Motor findings in the hands were no more than mild to moderate, as were motor and sensory findings in the legs. Nine patients improved with surgical decompression. The syndrome may result from ischemia to the intrinsic border areas of collateralization between the superficial pial network and the central arterial supply to the cervical cord, although venous stagnation may also play a role. This clinical presentation should always raise the suspicion of a cervical myelopathy, which is potentially treatable.\r"

Long lists of putative causes and associations have arisen, many consisting of individual case reports. We did a retrospective case-control study on 40 patients and 39 age- and sex-matched control subjects to examine the incidence of these associated conditions. Our results are only suggestive due to the small sample size; however, obesity and recent weight gain occurred more commonly in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in control subjects. All forms of menstrual abnormalities, incidence of pregnancy, antibiotic use, and oral contraceptive use were equal in both groups. A larger multicenter study will be needed to more completely characterize the risk factors for this condition.\r"

Surgical foramen magnum decompression considerably reduced the nystagmus and abolished the postural variation of aqueduct diameter.

  ".W": "In about 6% of patients with keratoconus, there is a history of familial disease. High keratometric astigmatism and mildly irregular mires observed by placidois disc have been suggested to represent variable forms of expression of a gene in family members of patients with keratoconus. We used a computer-assisted digital videophotokeratoscope to map the corneas of 28 family members of 5 patients with keratoconus. Abnormalities observed in family members included central steepening, greater steepening of the cornea inferior to the apex, and substantial asymmetry in the central dioptric power between the two eyes of the same individual. These findings were similar to, but less severe than, those found in patients with keratoconus and may represent the variable expression of a gene contributing to the development of keratoconus. Pedigree analysis in these families suggests an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.\r"

The diabetic group consisted of 18 patients without retinopathy and 13 with mild background retinopathy. Oscillatory potentials were measured at low-stimulation energies. Significantly reduced amplitudes and component-specific delayed peak implicit times were found in both diabetic groups compared with the data from the controls. Similar results were obtained in the photopic and scotopic electroretinogram. From these findings, we suggest that retinal dysfunction is already present in juvenile diabetics without photographic evidence of retinopathy after a mean duration of diabetes of 7 years.\r"

Almost half of the traumas (1127 [47%] of 2416 eyes) were sustained by children younger than age 17 years, and mainly between the ages of 6 and 12 years. Most of the injuries happened at home (38.1%) or in the street (26.8%) and during play and sport (65.1%). The male-to-female ratio among the children was 4:1. Blunt injuries accounted for 59.2%; 30.5% were perforating injuries and the rest were chemical and radiation injuries. The visual acuity at the time of hospital discharge was better than 6/30 in the majority of the eyes but 122 patients (11%) had a visual acuity of less than 6/60, and no light perception was the result in 40 eyes (3%). The reasons for the severe outcome were as follows: 23 eyes (2%) owing to phthisis, 22 eyes (1.9%) were enucleated, and 16 eyes (1.4%) suffered from endophthalmitis.\r"

The test was administered to 119 patients with a diagnosis of Horner's syndrome and to 50 normal subjects. We compared the cocaine-induced anisocoria in the two groups by measuring photographs of the pupils. We found the cocaine test to be highly effective in separating normal subjects from patients with Horner's syndrome. The chances of having Horner's syndrome increased with the amount of cocaine-induced anisocoria. Through the use of logistic regression analysis, we determined the odds ratio of having Horner's syndrome compared with not having it for each 0.1-mm increment of anisocoria measured after cocaine administration. A postcocaine anisocoria value of 0.8 mm gave a mean odds ratio of approximately 1050:1 that Horner's syndrome was present (lower 95% confidence limit = 37:1). We found that simply measuring the postcocaine anisocoria provided a better prediction of Horner's syndrome than taking the trouble to calculate the net change in anisocoria. Odds ratios should help the clinician decide if the result of a cocaine test is indicative of Horner's syndrome.\r"

We treated eight patients with persistent nasolacrimal duct obstruction after endoscopic sinus surgery. All patients required dacryocystorhinostomy to achieve a patent lacrimal system drainage. To our knowledge, this is a previously unreported complication in the ophthalmologic literature. The relevant anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct is discussed in addition to surgical procedures for avoidance and treatment of iatrogenic injury to the system. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a highly successful procedure that is rapidly gaining popularity among otolaryngologists. As the number of patients undergoing this type of surgery increases, an increase in the relative number of ocular complications should be anticipated.\r"

Connective tissue area as a proportion of the lamina cribrosa area was significantly less and pores were significantly larger in the superior and inferior than in the nasal and temporal quadrants of the lamina cribrosa. These differences were more pronounced for peripheral as compared with central regions of the lamina cribrosa. Less connective tissue support for nerve fibers in the superior and inferior quadrants of the optic nerve head could contribute to their greater susceptibility to glaucoma damage by allowing greater distortion of these regions at elevated intraocular pressures. The least connective tissue support was present in the inferoperipheral region of the lamina cribrosa, which may be related to the greater frequency of superior visual field defects in glaucoma. Blacks had larger total lamina cribrosa area, indicating a larger optic nerve head, and also a greater number of laminar pores than whites. However, the connective tissue proportion and pore size distribution in the laminae cribrosae of blacks were almost identical to those of whites. We found no evidence suggesting that the greater susceptibility of blacks to glaucoma damage is due to less connective tissue support for nerve fibers passing through their laminae cribrosae than in whites.\r"

In 1956, a rigid Schreck total polymethylmethacrylate anterior chamber lens was implanted in the right eye of a 28-year-old white man 1 year after corneo-scleral laceration with traumatic cataract. The postoperative clinical course was subjectively unremarkable for at least 30 years. In 1988, the patient developed secondary angle closure glaucoma, associated with a cavernous Schnabel optic atrophy that was caused by peripheral anterior synechiae and fibrovascular downgrowth into the anterior chamber. The lens implant was encapsulated \"cocoonlike.\" Secondary proliferation of corneal endothelial cells covered the fibrous membrane and the chamber angle structures. No inflammatory reaction and only a very slight foreign-body reaction in the area of the footplate of the anterior chamber lens were present. Clinical and histopathological findings indicate that polymethylmethacrylate is sufficiently inert and biocompatible to be tolerated by the surrounding ocular tissues for more than 30 years.\r"

In view of the granular and membranous figures reflecting degenerating epithelial cells and secretory granules in the concretions, we argue that the concretions, are mostly composed of the mucinous secretion of the transformed conjunctival glands admixed with the degenerative products of the epithelial cells.\r"

We applied this model to study the effects of (1) inflammation, (2) repeated antibiotic doses, and (3) surgical status of the eye on cefazolin levels in the vitreous cavity after intravenous administration. Intravenous cefazolin sodium, 50 mg/kg, was administered every 8 hours for 48 hours. Eyes were harvested for assay of vitreous cavity antibiotic levels at various intervals from 1 to 49 hours. Drug levels were compared in inflamed and noninflamed eyes under both phakic and aphakic/vitrectomized conditions. At 1 hour, levels in phakic specimens were 3.0 mg/L in inflamed eyes vs undetectable in noninflamed eyes (P less than .01), but progressively increased to 10.6 mg/L at 49 hours (P less than .02) in inflamed eyes only. Levels in aphakic/vitrectomized eyes at 1 hour were 6.7 mg/L in inflamed eyes vs 4.2 mg/L in noninflamed eyes (P less than .1), but progressively increased to 24.9 mg/L at 49 hours (P less than .001) in inflamed eyes only. Levels at 49 hours in inflamed phakic and inflamed aphakic/vitrectomized eyes were well above the minimum inhibitory concentrations for organisms termed sensitive to cefazolin. We would conclude, therefore, that repeated doses of intravenous cefazolin may play an important adjunctive role in the treatment of endophthalmitis.\r"

In addition to the capillary basement membrane components, collagen types I and III and fibronectin were found in the basement membranes of retinal arterioles and venules. The basement membranes of choriocapillaries and retinal pigment epithelial cells in Bruch's membrane also showed a similar distribution of the retinal capillary basement membrane components. Both the inner and outer collagenous layers of Bruch's membrane contained collagen types I and III along with fibronectin, whereas collagen type VI was mostly limited to the central elastic lamina. The precise localization and distribution of various extracellular matrix components in human retinal vessels and Bruch's membrane may be important for understanding their normal function as well as their alteration in disease.\r"

Downward traction on all layers of the lid rather than cicatrization causes lower eyelid retraction. Sixty-one retracted lower eyelids were surgically repaired without a skin graft in 40 patients. In the new technique, the retracted lower lid is repaired by releasing the lower eyelid retractors from their tarsal attachment.

The paper demonstrates only the feasibility of a first step in defining the possible role of ethanol in some miscarriages. It identifies a difficulty encountered from earlier attendance in the miscarrying group so that a later study could circumvent it and perhaps lead to a case for funding of a prospective enquiry into the dose-response relations of any association that might exist.\r"

Decrease of the VMH excitability and abolishing of inhibitory effects of the dorsal hippocampus (HPC) and facilitatory influences of the midbrain reticular formation (MRF) on both motivational hypothalamic centres were found in animals after ethanol administration. Subsequent single injection of substance P (SP) (30 microgram-kg i.v.) just at the height of alcohol manifestations in central mechanisms of feeding and escape led to restoration of the VMH excitability and facilitatory MRF influences on this motivational centre. SP administration was also found to restore the inhibitory hippocampal and facilitatory MRF effects on the excitability of the LH feeding centre. Partial and selective SP restoration of ethanol-induced alterations in feeding and escape which are observed in the present study, as well as the data of some other researchers, led to the suggestion that peptides could be used as factors of enhancing tolerance to ethanol or curing deleterious acute alcohol-induced effects in motivated behaviours in animals.\r"

  ".W": "A single intraperitoneal injection of DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) (4 mmol/kg) to overnight-starved rats caused a 70% inhibition of hepatic gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and induced a decrease in liver-reduced glutathione (GSH) for several hours. There was, however, no difference in hepatic lipid peroxidation, as assessed by malondialdehyde accumulation, between the control and BSO groups. During acute ethanol intoxication (5 g/kg), hepatic lipid peroxidation was increased by approx. 40% within 6 hr. Hepatic [GSH] was also significantly decreased by ethanol. The effect of ethanol on GSH level was not observed in rats pretreated with BSO, though the ethanol-induced enhancement of hepatic lipid peroxidation was potentiated by the BSO pretreatment. Under these conditions there were no apparent effects on blood concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde nor on activities of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, glutathione-dependent detoxifying enzymes, superoxide dismutase or catalase. These results suggest that, although a decrease (by BSO) in GSH by itself does not alter the degree of endogenous lipid peroxidation, it is associated with a potentiation of the enhancement of hepatic lipid peroxidation caused by acute ethanol intoxication.\r"

However, because of ethanol-induced mucosal atrophy, specific absorption (expressed per g dry weight of mucosa) was almost doubled in ethanol-fed rats. In the upper jejunum, the active component of leucine uptake was significantly greater in ethanol-fed rats (72% vs. 52%), whereas in the lower ileum the relative contributions of active uptake and diffusion were unaltered. We propose that the increase in active uptake in the upper jejunum is the result of a higher concentration of aged enterocytes having a greater transport capacity at the villus surface.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were pair-fed either a nutritionally complete liquid diet containing 36% of total calories as ethanol or isovolumetric amounts of the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isocaloric glucose. Chronic ethanol feeding caused a preferential decline in the wet weight of the plantaris (predominantly Type II muscle fibres) which was accompanied by a reduction in the total DNA content. The soleus (a predominantly Type I fibre muscle) was relatively unaffected. Chronic ethanol exposure had no effect on the biochemical index of cell size (protein/DNA ratio) in either the plantaris or soleus. Quantitative histochemistry of Type II fibres in the plantaris demonstrated that ethanol caused an increase in the proportion of fibres with smaller diameters. Similar effects were observed for Type II fibres in the soleus. In contrast, ethanol exposure was associated with an increase in the relative proportion of Type I fibres with higher diameters, in both plantaris and soleus. Light microscopic examination of myopathic muscle sections demonstrated that lesions occurred without evidence of inflammation, fibrosis or other infiltration by non-muscle cells. It is concluded that chronic exposure of rats to ethanol is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. The lesion appears to be specific for Type II fibres, irrespective of the predominant fibre type in the particular muscle.\r"

Activities of both IL-1 and IL-2 in alcoholic hepatitis were similar to those of normal individuals, although in abstinent patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, IL-1 activity was increased and IL-2 activity decreased. Lymphocyte transformation in response to PHA in patients with alcoholic hepatitis was significantly impaired when compared with normal controls, and addition of exogenous IL-2 did not correct this impaired response over a wide range of concentrations of both PHA and IL-2. These observations suggest the underlying defects in cell mediated immunity in acute alcoholic hepatitis, as assessed by blast transformation, could be fundamentally different from those of alcoholic cirrhosis and could be secondary to the metabolic effects of acetaldehyde or altered redox potentials on the behaviour of proliferating cells.\r"

The incidence of ALDH V-A deficiency was not different between the patients with alcoholic liver disease and those with non-alcoholic liver disease, nor between the patients with liver disease and without liver disease in no relation to alcohol misuse. Ac-CHO metabolism was not different between ALDH V-A deficient and non-deficient patients even in the ALDH I-deficient patients. These results indicated that ALDH V-A isozymes play virtually no role in the metabolism of Ac-CHO and its deficiency is not related to the development of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

The parameters were highly correlated (r = 0.915) by orthogonal least squares. Eight of the fasting subjects received four different oral doses of alcohol and fourteen subjects each received three different alcohol treatments. Intra-subject variances of Vm', Km and the ratio Vm' Km were calculated from the multiple treatments. Inter-subject variances were calculated from the 22 mean values of each parameter. Each parameter and the intra-subject variances of the parameters were found to be log normally distributed. The liquid meals (carbohydrate, fat and protein separately) appeared not to affect the parameter values. The computer fittings were all excellent as evidenced by the relatively small standard deviations of the estimated parameters and other statistical measures of fit.\r"

However, much of the evidence used to support this association is anecdotal, or at best, based on descriptive studies. Data calculated from cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies, undertaken in Great Britain, show that individuals who consume alcohol are several times more likely to perpetrate violence, or to be the victims of violence, than individuals who do not consume alcohol. If criteria for causality are used to assess these findings, then it would appear that alcohol is likely to be a causal factor in both violence perpetration and violence victimization. However, the proportion of interpersonal violence caused by alcohol and the levels of alcohol consumption associated with significantly increased risks of involvement in interpersonal violence cannot be identified from the data available to date.\r"

Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded from Cz', T12, and the left popliteal fossa following left posterior tibial nerve stimulation. The latency and amplitude of the corresponding potentials (i.e., P37, N20, and N7) were compared with normal values obtained from age- and height-matched controls. There was no significant difference in the values of N7, suggesting an intact afferent peripheral pathway; in contrast, the amplitudes of P37 and N20 were decreased with normal latencies. The degree of amplitude decrease correlated with the severity of vibration sense impairment in the lower limbs. These results appear to support selective axonopathy of the centrally directed axons of the dorsal root ganglion cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that different degrees of dorsal column involvement in hereditary spastic paraplegia can cause different types of somatosensory evoked potential abnormalities, namely, attenuated amplitudes with no latency shifts, as recorded in this family, and the prolonged latencies, as reported previously.\r"

At the time of the first plasmapheresis, 3 patients were on respirators (Grade 5 on the Guillain-Barre syndrome scale 0-6); 7 were bedridden (Grade 4); and 1 required assisted ambulation (Grade 3). One week after the last plasmapheresis, all but 1 patient had improved by 1 or more grades on the Guillain-Barre syndrome scale. At subsequent examination 6 months later, all patients were ambulatory and 9 of 11 had no significant neurologic findings. Electrophysiologic studies performed shortly before treatment initiation revealed predominant demyelinating neuropathy in 9 and axonal changes in 2. During the 76 plasmapheresis procedures, no severe complications were encountered. Although the number of patients treated is small, the clinical response observed would indicate plasmapheresis to be a safe and effective therapy in children with acute inflammatory polyneuropathy.\r"

In both ADHD-Sz and ADHD groups, the prevalence of learning disabilities (LD) and a variety of behavioral features were similar. Neither seizure disorder nor ADHD was associated with an increased incidence of structural abnormalities or asymmetries of the brain. These findings support the belief that epilepsy adversely affects IQ but does not appear to affect the prevalence of LD or behavioral abnormalities in ADHD children. They further support the accumulating body of data demonstrating normal brain anatomy in ADHD by computed tomography.\r"

There was no significant correlation between verbal intelligence scores and MRI findings, DNA deletion, or the clinical severity of the disease. These first MRI studies of DMD did not reveal any significant anatomic brain alteration, other than mild atrophy in 2 patients.

Local experience has been variable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three factors for their effect on two-dimensional color Doppler display of the apparent area of regurgitant flow. The factors studied were instrument gain setting, pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and carrier frequency. Sixteen regurgitant valves were examined with high quality commercial instrumentation from two manufacturers. Electrocardiographic-triggered image gating was used for recording and planimetry of maximal imaged flow area (IFA). Examinations were performed at two gain settings with constant carrier frequency and PRF, at three carrier frequencies (2.5, 3.5, and 5 MHz) at constant gain, and at differing PRF (3.0 to 12 kHz). Reduction in gain setting made little difference in asthetic quality of regurgitant jets, but their areas decreased by 29%. Carrier frequency was found to greatly affect IFA, with each higher carrier frequency giving significantly smaller IFAs. PRF also affected IFA consistently, with progressively smaller IFAs at each higher PRF. There was no useful correlation between IFA of a single jet evaluated on the two instruments at generally similar settings. It is concluded that instrument gain setting, PRF, and carrier frequency each significantly affects the size of IFA within a single instrument and between different instruments. Given the variety of instruments and settings employed within the cardiology community, it is unlikely that even moderately accurate grading of severity of regurgitation based on IFA can be done unless instrument settings are specified and standardized. There is a clear need for annotation of instrument settings during color Doppler examinations and a need for concensus regarding \"optimal\" settings. Finally, the consistency of reduction in IFA with increasing carrier frequency and PRF within each of the instruments tested suggests investigation of \"normalization\" of IFA displays.\r"

Preoperative EF and ESVI in 13 patients with AR correlated well with postoperative delta %FS and delta mVcf. Similarly, preoperative EF and ESVI in nine patients with AS correlated well with postoperative delta %FS and delta mVcf. Our study demonstrated that preoperative LV systolic function in AR and AS patients closely reflected postoperative LV response to exercise. Preoperative smaller ESVI will be warranted to expect a favorably good postoperative LV response to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a technique to assess regional myocardial perfusion by quantifying echocardiographic myocardial contrast appearance and intensity after aortic root injection of an agitated diatrizoate meglumine solution. The technique was validated by comparing digitized echocardiographic contrast parameters to regional perfusion in the circumflex bed determined by calibrated Doppler flow probe and antemortem monastral blue staining. Regional perfusion was altered by circumflex stenosis, occlusion, and reactive hyperemia. Contrast effects were measured in an initial subset of six dogs by peak intensity change, time to peak intensity, maximal rate of intensity rise, and mean intensity change integrated over 1, 2, or 3 seconds after contrast appearance (MI1, MI2, MI3). MI2 and MI3 best predicted regional perfusion (r = 0.93, standard error of the estimate [SEE] 0.38 ml/gm/min for each). These findings were confirmed in a second subset of six dogs (r = 0.84, SEE = 0.70 ml/gm/min). Although there was a relatively broad standard error for the prediction of absolute perfusion for the pooled data, for individual dogs data were internally consistent so that each had r greater than 0.88 for its varied flow states. The hyperemic ratio calculated by contrast echocardiography correlated well with the Doppler value (r = 0.85). Observer and study-to-study predictive variabilities were small (SEE 0.19 to 0.32 ml/gm/min). No alterations were seen in hemodynamics or reactive hyperemia after 25 consecutive injections over a 90-minute period. Contrast echocardiography with aortic root contrast injection tracks changes in regional blood flow. This approach can assess regional coronary reserve and detect changes in regional myocardial perfusion during acute ischemia and drug intervention.\r"

Albunex is a commercially prepared solution of air-filled albumin microspheres prepared from sonicated 5% human serum albumin. The effects of Albunex on coronary blood flow, left ventricular function, and systemic hemodynamics, as well as contrast enhancement were evaluated in 10 open chest, anesthetized dogs. After an intracoronary injection, Albunex did not alter left atrial, left ventricular systolic or end-diastolic, or mean aortic pressures. It did not cause a coronary hyperemic response, alter left ventricular systolic thickening, or lower the peak positive left ventricular dp/dt. It did not alter these measurements even in the presence of a critical coronary stenosis. The contrast opacification produced by Albunex microbubbles was dose dependent (optimal dose range of 0.033 to 0.5 ml/kg), with attenuation occurring at higher doses. In conclusion, although Albunex provides adequate contrast enhancement, intracoronary injection of Albunex does not significantly alter coronary blood flow, left ventricular function, or systemic hemodynamics. Because of the standardized size and concentration of the microspheres, Albunex may be an ideal agent for myocardial contrast echocardiography.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery pressure is an important component of cardiac ultrasound studies. A number of methods are available for estimation of pulmonary pressure, each with varying degrees of reported accuracy. To assess feasibility and accuracy, noninvasive pulmonary artery pressure estimates were performed in infants and children at the time of catheterization. Patients were examined prospectively until there were 50 patients, in whom each of six methods for estimation of pulmonary pressure had been accomplished. All patients had tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation of less than severe degree and no structural, flow, or electrocardiographic abnormality known to compromise the six methods. Systolic pressure was estimated by the Burstin method and also from peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity. Mean pressure was estimated by acceleration time divided by ejection time from waveforms obtained from the right ventricular outflow tract and main pulmonary artery. Diastolic pressure was estimated by systolic time intervals and from end-diastolic pulmonary regurgitation velocity. Noninvasive estimates were compared with simultaneous or nearly simultaneous catheterization measurements. For systolic pressure Burstin estimates were accomplished in 89% with high accuracy (r = 0.97). Tricuspid regurgitation velocities were recorded in 82%, also with high accuracy (r = 0.96). Waveforms for mean pressure estimation were recorded in 98% to 100% of patients. Those from the right ventricular outflow tract corresponded well with catheterization pressures (r = 0.94), whereas those recorded from the main pulmonary artery offered poor prediction of pulmonary pressure (r = 0.63). Systolic time interval measurements were accomplished in only 65% and did not correlate highly with catheterization (r = 0.84). Diastolic pressure estimates based on pulmonary regurgitation velocity were recorded in 98% of subjects with high accuracy (r = 0.96). Each method had advantages and disadvantages. The Burstin method was accurate but technically demanding and is reported to be limited by heart rate and significant right-sided regurgitation. Peak tricuspid velocities proved unexpectedly difficult to record in some patients but when successful, provided excellent prediction of pressure. Recording of waveforms for ratios of acceleration time to ejection time proved easy, but accuracy was high only for outflow tract waveforms. Peculiarities of main pulmonary artery flow may have led to poor accuracy for ratios measured from that site. For diastolic pressure estimation, systolic time interval records were the most difficult to obtain and did not provide useful accuracy. In contrast, pulmonary regurgitation velocities were easily obtained and provided high accuracy results. This is a selected pediatric series, evaluating methods in nearly ideal circumstances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Pulsed Doppler echocardiography with color Doppler flow imaging demostrated that in 20 of the 22 patients with obstruction, mitral regurgitation occurred mainly during midsystole from the onset to the end of mitral-septal contact. Such midsystolic mitral regurgitation was not observed in patients without obstruction, except in three of 25 patients with mild mitral systolic anterior motion without septal contact. Furthermore, that regurgitation developed or disappeared together with the obstruction during follow-up periods or pharmacologic interventions. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that in 21 of the 22 patients with obstruction, a distal residual portion of the \"anterior\" mitral leaflet moved anteriorly in early systole and protruded into the outflow tract during midsystole to cause the obstruction. In the other patient with obstruction, who had only early systolic mitral regurgitation, a distal residual \"posterior\" leaflet moved similary. These results may indicate that the midsystolic mitral regurgitation is hydrodynamically induced by the midsystolic pressure gradient across the protruding distal residual anterior mitral leaflet.\r"

Technical advances such as the introduction of anular array transducers and digital recording techniques have improved the prospect of obtaining this examination in a reasonable number of patients. It is now possible to detect atherosclerotic disease in the left main and the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery in 70% to 80% of all patients. This echocardiographic technique appears to be a sensitive means of detecting coronary atherosclerosis. Preliminary data suggest that this examination may be helpful in making the differential diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

To maximize the number of patients who can be scanned in one outpatient session and to minimize the facilities needed, we elected to perform the technique on unsedated patients. To assess the tolerance of patients to this policy, we designed a questionnaire to evaluate the patients' own assessment of the technique. Overall, the technique was well tolerated by 79% of 204 patients, although 37% found swallowing the transducer unpleasant. The procedure was not tolerated as well by younger patients. When asked whether they would prefer to be sedated or unsedated, 83% preferred to be unsedated for an outpatient scan, and 73% preferred to be sedated for an inpatient scan. We concluded that the technique is well tolerated by most unsedated patients. Because a few patients preferred sedation, some outpatient facilities for patient recovery were necessary. We now ask young patients, selected inpatients, and patients undergoing repeat studies whether they would prefer sedation, but we otherwise perform the technique on unsedated patients.\r"

Valvular destruction, congestive heart failure, embolic phenomena, failure of medical therapy, and death are all more common in patients with echocardiographically discernible valvular lesions. Transthoracic echocardiography is often unsatisfactory for evaluation of vegetations in patients with chest wall deformities, lung disease, obesity, or prosthetic valves. The transesophageal approach affords uniformly high-quality images with excellent structural resolution. We present a case of suspected subacute bacterial endocarditis in a patient with equivocal diagnoses of vegetations on three separate transthoracic echocardiograms in whom transesophageal evaluation revealed obvious large vegetations that involved the aortic and mitral valves. Subsequent autopsy confirmed this diagnosis. The case illustrates the utility of a new imaging method for the detection of valvular vegetations. In view of the prognostic implications of detected vegetations, transesophageal echocardiography probably should be performed on all patients with suspected subacute bacterial endocarditis and equivocal results by transthoracic study.\r"

Accordingly, the goal of this study was twofold: to derive dimensionless echocardiographic descriptors of left ventricle chamber shape that are independent of chamber volume and to use these descriptors to quantitatively compare the shape of left ventricles that were either of normal size (81 +/- 17 ml, 19 patients) or were enlarged secondary to idiopathic cardiomyopathy (194 +/- 61 ml, 46 patients) or chronic aortic or mitral valve incompetence (196 +/- 67 ml, 14 patients). Two-dimensional and M-mode determined descriptors of left ventricle shape based on its width, length, and area were found to be independent of left ventricle volume. These descriptors were significantly greater in cardiomyopathy compared with the normal or dilated left ventricle secondary to valvular incompetence, indicating that the left ventricle had become nearly spherical. A spherical shape of the left ventricle was not observed with valvular incompetence. The ability to classify a patient as having either a normal or a cardiomyopathic left ventricle by discriminant function analysis was enhanced when both left ventricle size and shape were considered. In a prospective study using discriminant function and fractional shortening, we found that patients with valvular incompetence could be classified as having either a normal discriminant function and fractional shortening, an abnormal discriminant function and normal fractional shortening, or an abnormal discriminant function and fractional shortening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated the use of intravenous injection of saline solution for echo contrast to increase the percentage of quantifiable tricuspid regurgitant signals in patients who have any detectable tricuspid regurgitation at baseline. Patients underwent a standard Doppler evaluation, followed by a contrast study with the injection of 4 to 6 ml of agitated saline solution into a brachial vein. Baseline and contrast tricuspid regurgitant signals were assessed for quality, quantifiability, and reproducibility of the derived pressures by three observers on two occasions. The average absolute pairwise deviation among the three observers was low: 1.6 mm Hg (standard deviation, 1.4 mm Hg). The intraobserver mean discrepancy was low: 0.03 mm Hg (standard deviation, 2.33 mm Hg). Patients who did not have tricuspid regurgitation (n = 10) failed to develop such regurgitation during contrast injection. Only eight of 40 patients (20%) who had trace or mild tricuspid regurgitation had quantifiable baseline signals, but 34 patients (85%) had quantifiable signals with contrast injection. All patients who had mild to moderate, moderate, or severe tricuspid regurgitation (n = 10) had quantifiable signals before contrast injection. Of all patients who had any tricuspid regurgitation, 88% had quantifiable signals with contrast injection. Echo contrast was shown to improve the yield of quantifiable signals in patients who had trace and mild tricuspid.\r"

The first group (18 fetuses) had atrioventricular valve regurgitation and almost all of the fetuses had structural heart disease. No fetus in this group survived the neonatal period; only two of the pregnancies in this first group were terminated. A second group of three fetuses had ventricular volume overload from sacrococcygeal teratomas at 21 to 24 weeks' gestation. These fetuses also had nonimmune hydrops (or it developed), but they did not have structural heart disease or atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Combined ventricular output in this group was calculated by Doppler ultrasound to be greater than twice the normal output for fetuses of the expected gestational weight. The proportion of the combined output to the lower body and the placenta was increased with the increase to the teratoma, exceeding the increase to the placenta. In one fetus, serial study demonstrated increasing output and the development of hydrops. Intrauterine surgery was undertaken to control the high output failure. The abnormal variables tended to revert to normal after replacement of blood loss, and the hydrops disappeared. The pregnancy continued until the spontaneous rupture of membranes at 26 weeks' gestation forced delivery by cesarean section. The infant died from severe hyaline membrane disease. These findings suggest that, in some circumstances, fetal hydrops is a late sign of cardiac failure and heralds incipient death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, estimates of the amount of mitral regurgitation remain semiquantitative, and even severe mitral regurgitation may be underestimated in the presence of markedly eccentric regurgitant jets or acoustic shadowing of the left atrium by mitral or aortic prostheses. This report describes the Doppler findings in 10 patients with severe native valve mitral regurgitation (angiographic grade III or IV) and in 15 patients with severe bioprosthetic mitral regurgitation that required valve replacement. An increase in peak mitral flow velocity above normal values was seen in eight of 10 patients with severe native valve mitral regurgitation (greater than or equal to 130 cm per second) and 11 of 15 patients with severe prosthetic valve mitral regurgitation (greater than or equal to 210 cm per second). One of 10 patients with a native valve and four of 15 patients with a bioprosthetic valve appeared to have only a localized left atrial systolic flow disturbance, incorrectly suggesting that the mitral regurgitation was mild. However, in all patients with severe mitral regurgitation, a low velocity (less than 100 cm per second) flow signal could be recorded in the left ventricle that was directed toward the mitral valve in systole. This flow signal showed a gradual increase in velocity as the sample volume was moved toward the mitral valve, with an abrupt further increase on entry into the left atrium. This signal was continuous with antegrade mitral flow and had the same orientation as mitral regurgitation recorded by continuous wave technique from the apex. A similar flow signal was not recorded in the left ventricle of any individual in a control group of 30 patients who had no mitral regurgitation or who had angiographic grade I or II mitral regurgitation. These findings suggest that acceleration of left ventricle flow toward the mitral valve in systole is only recorded when there is hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation that is approximately equal to angiographic grade III or IV. Recognition of this Doppler finding may help in the estimation of mitral regurgitation severity, especially in difficult diagnostic situations.\r"

In a hydromechanical model we assessed the influence of total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance on the pressure half-time as measured by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography. In a computer model that used the half-time of the pressure gradient between the aorta and the left ventricle as an expression of pressure half-time, we assessed the influence of total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance and also the influence of left ventricular compliance on pressure half-time. In both models, although we found an inverse relation between regurgitant orifice area and pressure half-time, changing total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance (but not left ventricular compliance) within the physiologic range significantly altered the pressure half-times. We concluded that the influence of total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance limits the usefulness of Doppler echocardiographic determination of pressure half-time as a method of assessing the severity of aortic regurgitation.\r"

The subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 consisted of subjects who were younger than 50 years old (n = 61), and group 2 consisted of subjects who were at least 50 years old (n = 57). Mitral regurgitation was detected in 57 (48%) of the 118 subjects: 24 subjects (39%) in group 1 and 33 subjects (58%) in group 2. The severity of mitral regurgitation was trivial to mild.

Oximetry revealed a calculated pulmonary to systemic flow ratio ranging from 2.3:1 in the patient with the largest atrial septal defect by echocardiography to 1:1 (no oxygen saturation step-up) in the patient with the smallest atrial septal defect. In the three patients who underwent cardiac surgery, the operative findings confirmed those of echocardiography. We concluded that atrial septal defects are common after transseptal valvuloplasty. Usually, their relatively small size and the underlying valvular disease that produces high left atrial pressure are responsible for the high pressure gradient between the left and right atria. This results in the high velocity and continuous shunt jet detected by Doppler echocardiography.\r"

The aortic insufficiency was limited to the first half of diastole by prolapse of the intimal flap against the regurgitant orifice. This unusual pathophysiology was well demonstrated by two-dimensional and color flow Doppler echocardiography.\r"
