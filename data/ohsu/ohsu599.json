The rates among the prisoners from 1970 to 1984, although small, increased with a trend similar to that in the general population. Despite increases in the general population we conclude that prisoners are still at high risk for CIN.\r"

The female doctors were more likely than the male doctors to favour salaried practice in local community health centres, to practise in an urban setting and to have an office-based practice. The female physicians had a less diversified type of practice, being less involved in hospital care, emergency care, home care and administrative work. Sex differences were more marked for physicians in fee-for-service practice than for salaried physicians. Given the increasing numbers of women in the medical profession, these findings are of special interest since they indicate distinctive differences in medical practice between women and men.\r"

Of the 55 patients 42 were admitted under the terms of form 1 (application for psychiatric assessment) and 13 under the terms of form 3 (certificate of involuntary admission). All of the former patients and 70% of the latter were admitted under the criteria for dangerousness; however, one-third of these patients had failed to show any evidence of violent or suicidal behaviour. Most of the patients admitted because of their dangerousness had a nonpsychotic disorder, whereas 83% of those admitted because of lack of competence had a psychotic disorder. These findings are discussed in relation to the criteria for involuntary admission in the 1980 Mental Health Act of Ontario. The difficulties encountered in the admission process by physicians appear to be the result of a lack of clinical considerations and a predominant emphasis on dangerousness.\r"

The incidence of tumors developing in rats exposed to total-body gamma irradiation was reduced from 93% to 35% in female rats and from 59% to 7% in male rats after restriction of food intake. In a similar study carried out on mice, the incidence of leukemia in irradiated mice of both sexes was reduced from 50% to 4% after restriction of food intake. Radiation-induced leukemia in mice is caused by a transmissible virus activated by total-body gamma irradiation. In most of the animal species investigated thus far, tumors, leukemia, and lymphomas were found to be caused by transmissible viruses. It appears that activation of some of these latent viruses could be prevented by restriction of food intake. If the results of experiments carried out on mice and rats are extrapolated for humans, it would follow that all of us (particularly those who have had multiple cases of cancer or leukemia among family members) should aim at holding our weight below the limits considered normal for our age, sex, and height. This appears particularly important for persons that have been exposed to large doses of ionizing radiation.\r"

In a retrospective series of node negative or minimally involved patients by radiology, only eight of 28 (28.6%) survived when vascular invasion was detected, compared with 50 of 72 (69%) without vascular invasion. In 1977 a policy of adjuvant cytotoxics (vinblastine and bleomycin) was added to the radiotherapy which was standard postorchidectomy treatment at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. When platinum-based combination regimens were found to be effective, the radiotherapy was discontinued. Only two relapses with the original treatment occurred with one death 10 years later. The modified Einhorn protocol used as primary postorchidectomy treatment has prevented relapse in all six cases in whom it was used. The overall survival rate at 2 to 10 years is 94%. There are important implications in these findings for the \"watch policy\" which is becoming increasingly popular. In our opinion patients should not be merely watched when histologic sectioning of the primary reveals invasion of the vessels, of whatever type, by the tumor. Instead they should be treated.\r"

Ten other rats (controls) were similarly inoculated with saline. Both groups were allowed food and water ad libitum. An additional ten rats (pair-fed) were inoculated with saline and fed the same mean daily food intake as the tumor-bearing rats. Thirty-five days after inoculation the rats were killed by exsanguination. Livers, spleens, and tumors were weighed, and amino acid profiles and biochemical parameters were measured. Liver and spleen weights in tumor-bearing rats were significantly greater than control rats (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Liver weight in pair-fed rats was significantly less than control rats (P less than 0.01), but spleen weight was greater (P less than 0.01). Amino acid profiles of tumor-bearing rats and pair-fed rats were different from each other and from those of control rats. Branched-chain amino acids were lowest in tumor-bearing rats and significantly different from control and pair-fed rats. Lysine was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) and arginine significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in tumor-bearing rats compared with control rats. These different plasma amino acid profiles and changes in serum biochemistry of cachectic tumor-bearing rats compared with malnourished pair-fed rats suggest specific tumor effects on host metabolism not mediated solely by anorexia.\r"

Forty-nine cases were diploid (38%) and 80 cases were aneuploid (62%). There was no correlation between DNA ploidy and histologic type. In aneuploid tumors, incidence of lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and rate of advanced cases were significantly higher than those in diploid tumors. During the follow-up period of 5 to 10 years, 23 of 40 patients (55%) with aneuploid tumors died of disease within 3 to 120 months. Only 13 of 36 patients (36%) with diploid tumors died of disease. The BrdU labeling indices (BrdU LI) ranged from 2.8% to 26.7%, with a mean of 10.4%. There was no correlation between BrdU LI and histologic type or stage. The mean BrdU LI of early cancers was 8.1%. The mean BrdU LI of advanced cancers was 11.9%. The BrdU LI of cancers with lymphatic invasion or lymph node metastasis was higher than those without them. The mean BrdU LI of diploid cancers was 6.0%. The mean BrdU LI of aneuploid cancers was 11.9%. There was a good correlation between BrdU LI and DNA ploidy patterns. These results indicate that DNA ploidy patterns and BrdU LI may possibly be useful prognostic markers for gastric cancers.\r"

The data were compared with 20 cases of intramucosal differentiated (or intestinal type) adenocarcinoma of the stomach, with special reference to their macroscopic shape and frequency of DNA aneuploidy. DNA aneuploidy was found in 77% of the crater-shaped carcinomas and in 17% of the polypoid tumors of the large intestine. The frequencies were significantly different and the frequency gap amounted to 60%. However, 18 of 20 (90%) gastric adenocarcinomas were nonpolypoid in shape, whereas two (10%) were polypoid. DNA aneuploidy was found in 50% of the gastric adenocarcinomas and 56% of the nonpolypoid gastric adenocarcinomas. This value did not differ from the values reported previously for the submucosally invasive and advanced crater-shaped intestinal type adenocarcinomas of the stomach. Biologic characteristics of adenocarcinomas of the large intestine can be compared with those of intestinal type adenocarcinomas of the stomach, because intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma is surrounded mostly by intestinalized mucosa and considered to arise from the epithelium under induction or progression of intestinal differentiation. Therefore, we inferred that the frequency gap in DNA aneuploidy between the crater-shaped and polypoid tumors of the large intestine implies that in the large intestine approximately 60% of the crater-shaped invasive carcinomas develop from the small nonpolypoid carcinomas.\r"

They were fibroadenoma-like by gross examination and biphasic by light microscopy, containing both tubular glands and spindled myoid cells. Immunocytochemical studies revealed cytokeratin and S-100 immunoreactivity in both the spindled myoid cells and in the tubuloglandular cells (S-100 was focal in the latter). In addition, the spindled myoid cells were immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for desmin. Ultrastructural studies showed the tubular glands to be composed of luminal epithelial cells focally surrounded by myoepithelial cells, but the stroma contained spindled myoepithelial cells admixed with occasional fibroblasts. The diagnostic term, \"adenomyoepithelioma,\" is appropriate for biphasic tumors having both glandular and myoepitheliomatous differentiation. Although additional experience is necessary to be conclusive regarding the biologic behavior of these unusual lesions, the authors believe the adenomyoepitheliomas described here are benign. They were well circumscribed without invasion of adjacent breast, contained neither mitotic figures nor cytologic atypia, and have not recurred or metastasized (6 and 10 months after removal).\r"

There were 48 cases (19.3%) with glandular and/or mucus-secreting components, in addition to the usual components of squamous cell carcinoma. Coexistence of intraepithelial carcinoma was observed in 20 cases (41.7%) among 48 with glandular differentiation, as compared with 57 cases (28.4%) without this differentiation. Of the 20 cases with glandular differentiation without preoperative irradiation, there were 16 (80.0%) containing areas of intraepithelial carcinoma. Moreover, among 77 cases with intraepithelial carcinoma, 20 (26.0%) were accompanied by glandular differentiation. Of nine tumors restricted to the mucosal or submucosal layer in 48 cases with glandular differentiation and in 44 of 203 cases without such differentiation, there were eight cases (88.9%) and 31 cases (70.5%) containing the areas of intraepithelial carcinoma, compared with rates of 30.8% and 16.6%, respectively, in the advanced carcinomas. Therefore, in the early carcinomas with glandular differentiation, there often coexist intraepithelial carcinomas. This high incidence of the coexistence of intraepithelial carcinoma and glandular differentiation, particularly in early cancers, supports the theory of a field carcinogenesis of esophageal carcinomas.\r"

Of the 36 tested, comparative CE were evaluable in 29. CE was 0 in both solid tumor and ascites in one patient. CE was 0 in four other ascites samples from four patients. In other 24, the relative CE of solid tumor/ascites from each patient ranged from 0.066 to 435. In the 29 patients with samples of ascites and a solid tumor evaluable for concurrent CE, the median colony counts of solid tumors was more than tenfold higher than ascites. The solid tumors obtained from 31 patients had a significantly higher CE than tumor cells obtained from ascites samples from 32 patients. Solid tumors were significantly better than ascites for in vitro testing based on the data that 75% (27/36) of solid tumors and only 31% (11/36) of ascites formed greater than or equal to 30 colonies. The drug sensitivity profiles of tumor cells from a solid tumor and ascites of the same patient appear similar. Based on these observations, it may be more cost and labor effective to do soft agar in vitro chemotherapy assays using a solid tumor than ascites in ovarian carcinoma.\r"

The cytologic specimens from Tenckhoff catheters from 40 consecutive patients with primary ovarian (39) and tubal (1) cancer who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been reviewed retrospectively. A total of 237 specimens yielded 78 (33%) positive, 138 (58%) negative, and 21 (9%) inconclusive or suspicious fluids. The major diagnostic problem was the marked mesothelial atypia, which may be related to the high concentrations of cytotoxic agents intimately in contact with the peritoneum. Of the 15 patients who had tissue examined after placement of the catheter (mean interval, 5 months), results agreed with those of the catheter cytologic specimens in ten patients. The catheter cytologic specimen was never positive when histology was negative. Of the 36 patients with evaluable follow-up (mean, 19 months), agreement between the clinical course and the catheter cytologic results was found in 27 patients (75%). Again, interpretation of the catheter specimens was never positive in the face of a benign clinical course. Thus, evaluation of catheter specimens by cytologic examination has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 100%, respectively. Tenckhoff catheter cytology has proven to be a rather valuable tool to monitor persistent or recurrent intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma.\r"

After a thorough evaluation, 25 cases (1.1%) fulfilled the histologic criteria for small cell cancer defined by Reagan and coworkers. These patients were computer-matched for age, disease stage, and lesion size to 25 patients with large cell nonkeratinizing cancer and 25 patients with keratinizing squamous cell cancer. Morphometric analyses of nuclear size and maximum nuclear diameter were performed on all cases without knowledge of cell type. Small cell cancers were characterized by a nuclear area of 160 mu 2 or less and a maximum nuclear diameter of 16.2 mu, which was significantly lower than that for large cell tumors. Thirty-three percent of the small cell carcinomas stained positively for the neuroendocrine markers (neuron-specific enolase [NSE] and chromogranin [CGR]), whereas the remainder contained only epithelial markers such as cytokeratin (CYK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Small cell cancers were associated with a high frequency of lymph-vascular space invasion and a diminished lymphoplasmacytic response. Patients with small cell cancer had a significantly higher recurrence rate, particularly to extrapelvic sites, than the matched patients with large cell cancers, and their survival was lower. Clinical trials to determine the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of small cell cervical cancer are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Correlation between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels of peripheral and draining venous blood, and 11 histopathologic and immunohistochemical variables was examined in 83 patients with colorectal cancer. CEA levels of draining blood (mean 34.5 ng/ml and positive rate greater than 5 ng/ml, 60.2%) were significantly higher than those (13.0 ng/ml and 28.9%) of peripheral blood. However, CA19-9 levels (mean 576.1 U/ml and positive rate greater than 37 U/ml, 29.5%) of draining blood were not different from those (568.0 U/ml and 29.5%) of peripheral blood. Immunohistochemically, CEA was observed in all of the 83 specimens and distributed in most of all cancer cells, whereas CA19-9 was found in 52 (62.5%) of the 83 specimens and sporadically distributed in some parts of cancer lesions in general. Elevation of CEA levels in draining and peripheral blood was most highly correlated with venous invasion, although the levels were related to four other histopathologic variables including liver metastasis, invasive layer of colorectal wall, lymphatic invasion, and Dukes' classification. Significant correlation between the CEA localized pattern of cancer cells was not found. Patients with CA19-9 nonlocalized cancer showed no elevation of the antigen levels in both peripheral and draining blood. The elevation of CA19-9 levels in peripheral blood of patients with CA19-9 localized cancer was most highly associated with lymphatic invasion, although the levels were correlated with five other variables consisting of liver metastasis, tumor differentiation, invasive layer of colorectal wall, venous invasion, and Dukes' classification out of 11 histopathologic and immunohistochemical variables. CEA levels of draining blood rose from 18.2 ng/ml and 40.3% to 30.1 ng/ml and 72.6%, respectively, after operative stimuli to cancer lesions, whereas the change of CA19-9 levels in draining blood of patients with CA19-9 localized cancer was not found during the time of operation. These results suggest that CEA may be drained mainly by the hematogenous portal system by the draining vein from the cancer cells in the invasive veins and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system. It is also suggested that the CEA and CA19-9 elevation-relating variables may secondarily affect the CEA and CA19-9 elevation in the blood in association with the venous and lymphatic invasion of cancer lesions, respectively.\r"

The average age of these patients was 62 years. Eleven patients had either leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders (LEMP). The rest had lymphoma (LYMPH). The Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) in the LYMPH patients was 1015 +/- 115 kcal/24 hr. This value in the LEMP group was significantly elevated at 2083 +/- 270 kcal/24 hr (P less than 0.025) despite similar weights and ages between the two groups. Net Protein Catabolism (NPC) in the LYMPH group was 82 +/- 29 mg/kg.hr. In contrast the value in the LEMP group was more than doubled at 174 +/- 30 mg/kg.hr (P less than 0.05). Glucose production in the LYMPH group was 14.1 +/- 2.7 mumol/kg.min, and the percent of glucose uptake oxidized in the LYMPH group was 37% +/- 9%. In contrast, glucose production in the LEMP group was significantly elevated (P less than 0.025) at 41.0 +/- 8.1 mumol/kg.min, and the percent of glucose uptake oxidized was significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) at 20% +/- 4% compared with the value in the LYMPH group. Glucose recycling in the LYMPH group was 9.0% +/- 6%. In the LEMP group the rate of recycling was significantly elevated at 60.3% +/- 4.8% (P less than 0.005). The percent suppression of endogenous glucose turnover during glucose infusion in the LYMPH group was 96% +/- 4%. The value for the LEMP patients was significantly less at 30.2% +/- 5% (P less than 0.0005). The serum cortisol concentration in the LYMPH patients was 285 +/- 74 nmol/l. The value in the LEMP patients was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) at 579 +/- 22 nmol/l. The authors concluded that hematologic malignancy is not a homogeneous group when evaluated metabolically. Lymphoma patients are similar metabolically to normal volunteers, but LEMP patients form a distinct group with major abnormalities in both glucose and protein kinetics and energy expenditure.\r"

The results correspond to an average increase in breast cancer risk of 4.0% for each year of decrease in age at menarche, and an increase in risk of 3.6% for each year of increase in age at menopause. The protective effect of early menopause was strongest for breast cancer diagnosed in patients 80 years of age or older.

Five-year survival was markedly better for Stage B3 (64% versus 11%). Regardless of stage, local recurrence was increased, and 5-year survival decreased for those cancers with carcinomatous adhesions. At surgery, lesions cannot be staged accurately into C3 or B3 cancers. All such lesions should be resected.

Seven hundred twelve patients with first episodes of localized VZ infection (zoster) were analyzed for potential risk factors for dissemination. Significant risk factors after univariate analysis included the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, decreasing age, chemotherapy within 6 months of VZ infection, and extensive tumor at initial tumor diagnosis. Complete tumor remission at the time of infection, previous radiotherapy, and breast or gynecologic cancer were associated with reduced risk in this analysis. After multivariate analysis the following factors were independently associated with increased risk: Hodgkin's disease (P less than 0.001), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (P = 0.016), and head and neck cancer (P = 0.043). Complete tumor remission and previous radiotherapy were again related to a reduced risk of infection. This study identifies risk factors that define specific subgroups of adult cancer patients with zoster infections who are at increased risk for VZ dissemination. These factors may be useful in prospectively defining high-risk groups in the design of antiviral therapy trials and may have a role in deciding which cancer patients with zoster will benefit most from receiving antiviral therapy to prevent dissemination.\r"

The mean age of the patients with gastric lymphoma was 49 years, and 36 years for patients with abdominal mass. The following conclusions were reached: (1) the relative frequency rate of NHL in South Turkey is higher than Turkey averages, but similar to other Middle East countries; (2) extranodal lymphomas account for more than 40% of all lymphomas; (3) gastric lymphoma is more prevalent than intestinal lymphoma in our region; and (4) compared with western gastric lymphomas, our patients were 10 years younger and had a higher incidence of small lymphocytic and immunoblastic lymphoma.\r"

  ".U": "89002636\r", 
  ".W": "In the design of new approaches to cancer prevention, it is important to realize that most cancers develop stepwise over a long period of time with nonmalignant precursor lesions that only slowly evolve toward cancer. With many chemicals and some radiations, as well as some viruses (DNA and some retroviruses), cancer development can be divided into 3 major stages or periods, initiation, promotion and progression. Initiation is frequently associated with a more or less permanent change in the phenotype of a rare target cell, presumably due to a change in base composition in DNA or to gene rearrangements. During promotion, these rare cells expand by proliferation to generate focal proliferations that resemble benign neoplasms. These in turn exercise at least one of two options, regression to normal appearing tissue or slow evolution to cancer. Progression is self generating but can be modulated by dietary manipulations or by other drugs or xenobiotics. The prolonged nature of the promotion-progression stages in most tissues and its modulatability indicate that these stages are vulnerable sites for the development of dietary and other ways to prevent the progression to cancer. This overall pattern is known to occur in the liver, skin and urinary bladder and is probable in several other tissues or organs including the colon, breast and pancreas. What we know about the human suggests that the patterns may be very similar for cancer development in many sites. The best worked out is melanoma. The phenotypic pattern of the precursor lesions in the experimental animals is remarkably similar in any single organ. For example, the hepatocyte nodules are very similar to each other with many different carcinogens and promoting environments even though the ultimate cancers are quite heterogeneous and diverse. The diversity and heterogeneity appears to be an acquisition that is quite late in the step-by-step development of cancer. Although its exact step has not been delineated as yet, it appears to be acquired as malignancy is. Unlike the cancers, the commonality or homogeneity in the precursor lesions offers many opportunities for interrupting the process and thus in preventing cancer. The experience to date in experimental systems with some hormones, drugs and dietary manipulations indicates that inhibition of the development of cancer may be most readily achieved by affecting the promotion and progression sequences in carcinogenesis.\r"

The former is useful in assessing the scope and dimensions of the cancer problem and the latter is used to assess environmental and lifestyle sources of cancer risk. A recent development in descriptive epidemiology is the use of functional measures of disease such as lost life expectancy. In analytical epidemiology, there is new or renewed interest in several lifestyle factors including diet and exercise as well as environmental factors such as involuntary tobacco exposure and radon in dwellings. Review of the evidence should consider the strengths and weaknesses of different research procedures. Each method is inconclusive by itself but, the different research designs of epidemiology collectively may represent a hierarchy of proof. Although the roles of many factors remain to be defined, the aggregate epidemiologic data continue to demonstrate the special importance of personal behavior and lifestyle in affecting cancer risk.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic studies have identified myriad factors related to cancer risk. Risk can be quantified on the basis of demographic factors, genetics, occupation, medical conditions, and lifestyle. Existing evidence suggests that: (1) individuals at risk often are unaware of their risk; (2) physicians may not know well those factors associated with the highest cancer risk; and (3) methods to reduce risk have been under-applied because of lack of knowledge, lack of funds, or lack of motivation among both patients and physicians. Methods to reduce risk do not follow the usual medical model in that those groups requiring risk-modification intervention usually are symptom free. Evidence indicates that elimination of tobacco use would reduce lung cancer deaths by 83% and substantially reduce the incidence of head and neck malignancies. Broad application of mammographic screening would effect a 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality. Dietary modification could potentially reduce cancer mortality by 30%. An effective program to reduce cancer risk will accomplish the following: (1) develop new and refine existing risk factor measurements to improve identification of individuals at risk; (2) apply risk factor identification and modification more completely to populations known to be at risk; (3) use combinations of risk factors to identify subpopulations at the highest risk; (4) apply existing prevention and screening modalities more broadly and uniformly; (5) identify new screening strategies with improved test performance and cost effectiveness to maximize screening efficiency; and (6) provide accurate and rapid means of risk assessment and quantification using the best available multivariate estimates of risk. An emphasis on education of primary care physicians to practice cancer prevention programs focused on personal risk profiles is reasonable since the populations these physicians serve express risk factors which represent 50% of the attributable risk for cancer in the US. A summary of site-specific risk factors which are amenable to intervention by primary care physicians is provided.\r"

Recent declines in lung cancer rates in men reflect a decline in men's smoking prevalence over the past few decades. However, lung cancer is still the major cause of cancer death in men and is now essentially tied with breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in women. The demography of smoking has markedly altered over time, so that current efforts to prevent tobacco use should address young women, ethnic minorities, lower socioeconomic groups, and Third World populations. The tobacco industry's aggressive strategies to promote tobacco use should also be monitored, publicized, and countered. Relevant activities for the individual health-care practitioner are suggested here. Because more than 25% of Americans are still smoking, our priority in cancer prevention must be to continually encourage the reduction of tobacco use.\r"

The physician often laments patient failure to follow directions while the same patient complains that instructions were never given. Health care professionals should strive to \"practice as they preach.\" They need to assure that their patients have clearly understood the recommendations and that patient concerns are assessed and addressed. Similarly, patients need to participate more actively in their own health care and to assume greater initiative in getting their questions answered and their concerns addressed. To increase the likelihood of these actions and their intended health behavior changes, a set of principles derived from theory and research can be followed. These principles represent a way to understand and influence the health behavior of physicians and patients. The principles are interactive and complementary and are based on the elements that appear to be associated with successful educational programs. Consideration of these principles in the conduct of educational diagnoses, interventions, and health education programs increases the incidence and durability of behavior change.\r"

Screening by means of physical examination and mammography can significantly improve the mortality associated with this disease, but the procedures have been underutilized. Surveys indicate that among the major reasons for the failure of utilization are questions concerning efficacy, fear of radiation and costs. The amount of radiation delivered to the breast during mammography no longer poses a significant risk and there is ample documentation that screening mammography can detect occult disease. Although there is an unequivocal benefit for those older than 50 years of age, debate concerning the 40 to 50 age group continues. Objections center primarily about the expense of mammography. Current cost-cutting techniques suggest that the procedure can be justified for all women older than 40 years.\r"

An early oral cancer can appear as an innocuous red or white change, an ulcer, or a lump, mimicking many benign lesions. Additionally, when the discomfort is minimal, professional consultation often is delayed, increasing the chance for local spread and regional metastases. Vital staining with toluidine blue and exfoliative cytologic examination can aid early detection by accelerating the biopsy of lesions that cannot be classified adequately or made to disappear.\r"

In 1980 it was converted to a General Cancer Screening Clinic for men and women. Its goal is to not only detect cancer, but to teach patients about the most current methods of self-examination and surveillance. In addition, there is a thorough assessment of each patient's risk factors for cancer, and attempts are made to assist them in altering life styles and habits by reducing potential for future cancer. Many community physicians perceived the hospital-based Screening Center as a potential duplication of medical services to their private patients. Several methods were used to solve this and other problems. Many innovative projects at the Center were used to promote both professional education and training to physicians and other health professionals, as well as public education for the community. Five thousand nine hundred thirty-four patients have been screened. There were 175 presentations to the community and 508 Clinic classes with 76 training sessions at the Center. A hospital-based Cancer Education and Prevention Center of this type can offer a service to the community and be a rich source of in-depth education for both professionals and for the public.\r"

Age recommendations rarely are made for prevention and early detection of cancer for elderly persons. However, cancer incidence and mortality rates are known to rise rapidly with increasing age. This paper takes a long-term public-health perspective to look toward the year 2030 to discuss the challenges of organizing and implementing prevention and early detection incentives for our nation's current and future elderly population. Cancer prevalence estimates in the context of the geriatric imperative of the 21st century are provided for three cancers--breast, prostate, and lung and bronchus. The sheer magnitude of numbers created by the aged population expansion can greatly increase the number of cancer survivors and newly diagnosed cases. Current efforts in cancer prevention and early detection should anticipate the health-care demands of the elderly in the first three decades of the next century.\r"

  ".W": "The tumors of infants, children, and adolescents are generally deep seated rather than superficially located cancers of epithelial structures. Appropriate mass screening techniques (i.e., pap smear, mammogram, hemoccult test, or chest radiograph) have not been available for the early detection of childhood tumors. It is widely believed that the tumors of children are not suitable for mass screening tests. Therefore, they are diagnosed most often at an advanced stage. An inexpensive urine test has been found to be effective in detecting neuroblastoma at an early, preclinical stage in infants as young as 6 months. The tumors detected in this manner have a high rate of curability. This test appears to be suitable for wide application and has been shown to be both cost-effective and medically effective. Much less is known about the possible causes of the cancers of children than about the cancers of adults, so preventive measures are less well defined. Children in whom cancer develops are more likely to have a genetic predisposition due to one of the rare but numerous heritable genetic defects associated with more than 100 such known syndromes or an acquired genetic defect. Such children are predisposed to cancer because they already have an inherited or acquired somatic genetic lesion and are more susceptible to another genetic insult that results in neoplasia. Such children should be screened regularly for the early detection of cancer. They also constitute a special population to which maximal preventive efforts should be applied, both because they are at high risk and because they constitute a unique population for testing the effectiveness of proposed preventive measures. Cancer is a multifactorial, multistep process that results in the highest incidence of cancer among older adults after a lifetime of exposure to known and presumed cancer risks. Current efforts at cancer prevention are aimed primarily at adults. A greater challenge, which should be even more effective, is to motivate children, their parents, and teachers to prevent the cancers of adults during childhood.\r"

In the last 10 years, nurses have shifted their orientation from tertiary prevention in the acute care setting and have increasingly become involved in primary and secondary prevention in both the hospital and the community. The nursing literature clearly reflects this new emphasis on incorporation of primary and secondary prevention concepts into nursing education and clinical practice. This article will focus on the traditional and nontraditional cancer prevention/early detection activities nurses have instituted in a multitude of settings (occupational, acute care, educational, and community) as well as pointing out the research that documents the effectiveness of these activities.\r"

Because MTC is one of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) tumors, treatment was undertaken with agents active in these diseases. Dacarbazine and 5-fluorouracil, given daily for 5 days every 4 weeks, resulted in complete resolution of pulmonary and subcutaneous lesions and a sharp decrease in tumor marker levels that lasted 10 months. Recurrence of the pulmonary disease lead to her death 21 months after presentation. Thus, the chemo-responsiveness of MTC may be akin to that of other APUD carcinomas (APUDomas) and treatment of metastatic MTC and other APUDomas with the combination of dacarbazine and 5-fluorouracil appears to merit further study.\r"

The antibody NKH-1 reacted strongly and diffusely with all of the SCLC and bronchial carcinoids but with none of the non-SCLC. NKH-1 also strongly labeled peripheral nerves in tissues adjacent to tumor. Two antibodies to cytokeratins reacted with all of the tumors and outlined tumor cells well, distinguishing them from surrounding stromal cells and leukocytes. OKT9, an antibody against transferrin receptor labeled all SCLC and eight of 11 non-SCLC but did not react with bronchial carcinoid. The antibodies Leu-M1, OKT10, Leu-7, and My4 reacted with 67%, 33%, 22%, and 11%, respectively, of the SCLC tested. The remaining 14 antibodies, including several with leukocyte specificity, labeled neither SCLC nor bronchial carcinoid. Thus, SCLC has a distinct immunophenotype (NKH-1 positive, keratin positive, and transferrin receptor positive), which may be helpful distinguishing this tumor from other tumors of lung including non-SCLC. SCLC infrequently expresses other leukocyte-associated antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The histogenesis of renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma is controversial. We compared immunohistochemical profiles of normal kidney, nine carcinomas, and six oncocytomas. Carcinomas and oncocytomas expressed the following antigens respectively: proximal tubule--Uro 3 (56 & 67%), alpha-1-antitrypsin (89 & 50%); proximal and distal tubule--Uro 10 (67 & 83%); distal tubule--B2-microglobulin (100 & 100%); distal/medullary tubule--epithelial membrane antigen (89 & 83%), neuron-specific enolase (78 & 100%), glandular cytokeratin (78 & 100%), epidermal keratin (67 & 67%); and medullary tubule--Uro 8 (89 & 83%). All tumors, except one oncocytoma, had at least one positive reaction for each antigen group. Oncocytomas predominantly stained for distal/medullary tubular antigens; none showed a predominance of proximal tubular antigens. Carcinomas also demonstrated largely distal/medullary tubule antigens; 44% showed prominence of proximal tubular antigens as well. Assignment of an exclusive proximal, distal or medullary tubule origin to renal neoplasms does not appear valid. Divergent histogenesis from a precursor stem cell is likely.\r"

  ".W": "Diffuse defibrination is rarely observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Clinical and immunologic data suggest that it is more likely to occur in T cell derived ALL. The current investigation involved the secretion of plasminogen activators (PA) of tissue type (t-PA) or urokinase type (U-PA) by testing supernatants of 21 permanent human leukemic cell lines originating from various hematopoietic lineages and one induced lymphoblastoid cell line. (LCL) The amount of PA in each supernatant was determined by biologic and immunoenzymologic assays. The correspondence with the expected molecular weight (MW) according to the PA type was checked by zymography. PA secretion of U-PA type was observed in the three myeloid cell lines. Except for the normal LCL, no B-lymphoid lineage related cell lines of various levels of differentiation displayed PA secretion, whereas PA activity was observed in the supernatant of six of nine malignant T-cell lines. The T-leukemic cell lines CCRF CEM, KE 37, HUT 78, and HUT 102 released U-PA-like activity. Peer released t-PA-like activity and CCRF-HSB2 supernatant showed both types of PA activity. These findings are discussed in view of the natural history of these diseases and the stage of differentiation of the cell lines.\r"

The changes, observed in 17 of 32 rats receiving MNNG, were permanent and consistently associated with pronounced histopathologic changes seen 10 months later (17 of 17). Comparable phenotypic changes were observed after 7 days only in MNNG-treated rat chief cell cultures. In human chief cell cultures a decrease of the Pg3 band, which is consistent with the \"carcinogenic\" phenotype, was observed in two of six preparations treated with MNNG. This early preceding change in phenotype preceding tumor formation may be useful as a diagnostic tool for the onset of gastric cancer.\r"

Exposures of 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5 and 30 Gy caused dose-related clinical and histologic changes peaking at 7 to 15 days post-exposure. Rats treated with 20 Gy were colonoscoped and biopsied daily and showed sequential post-irradiation endoscopic changes ranging from mucosal edema and mild inflammatory changes to erosion and ulcers. Histologically, crypt abscess and mural wall necrosis similar to changes found in the human rectum after radiotherapy were noted. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, (aspirin, indomethacin, piroxicam), misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue), or sucralfate (an anti-ulcer agent) did not ameliorate nor exacerbate radiation proctitis in rats exposed to 22.5 Gy. We conclude from these data that the female Wistar rat is a good model for studying radiation proctitis because endoscopic, histologic, and clinical changes seen post-exposure closely resemble those found in man.\r"

The sections were stained with the azure A-Feulgen reaction for nuclear DNA. In each section 200 nuclei of epithelial cells and 20 nuclei of lymphocytes were assessed; all measurements were made blindly. For each nucleus six features related to shape and amount of stain and six features related to chromatin pattern were assessed. For each feature the mean, SD, and interquartile range were determined and used for linear stepwise discriminant analysis. A model of three variables with the most discriminating power was developed. When the jackknifed classification test was applied using this model, the malignant potential of the lesions that later transformed could be predicted with 87.5% accuracy.\r"

Histopathologically, there was good correlation between lymphocytic infiltration and the development and spread of carcinoma. It is believed that lymphocytic infiltration around the tumor is an immunologic reaction induced by antigens from the carcinoma itself, and also that the reaction may progress according to tumor development. Immunocytochemically, we determined what type of inflammatory cells infiltrated the thyroid and demonstrated HLA-DR expression in the cancer cells. These findings are similar to autoimmune thyroiditis in which antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) works as a main immunomechanism.\r"

Three (11%) of the 27 histologically benign, seven (16%) of the 43 borderline malignant, and 59 (66%) of the 90 malignant neoplasms were aneuploid (P less than 0.0001). None of the patients with an aneuploid benign or borderline malignant tumor died from cancer, but in carcinomas the DNA index (DI) was a more important prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis than age at diagnosis, stage, histologic grade or ploidy (diploid versus aneuploid). A DI of 1.3 was the most effective value in predicting prognosis; patients with carcinoma with the DI more than 1.3 had inferior survival compared with those with the DI less than 1.3 (P = 0.002). Carcinomas with the DI more than 1.3 were more common in patients older than 60 years at diagnosis (P = 0.0002), and were associated with a low grade of differentiation (P = 0.008) but not with stage. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy may occur in benign and borderline malignant serous ovarian tumors and that the DI is a highly valuable and objective prognostic parameter in serous ovarian carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and pathologic data of 54 patients with clinically localized transitional cell tumors of the upper urinary tract were reviewed to determine the significance of tumor grade and stage on patient survival. There were 43 tumors of the renal pelvis (one bilateral) and 11 tumors of the ureter. The primary tumor was staged by the new TNM classification into low stage (Ta: limited to mucosa; T1: lamina propria invasion) and high stage (T2: muscularis invasion; T3; invasion beyond the muscularis). Tumors were low stage (Ta/T1) in 28 cases (51.8%) and advanced (T2/T3) in 26 cases (48.2%). Twenty-five of 54 (46.3%) of the patients had low grade (Grades 1 and 2) and 29 of 54 (53.7%) had high grade (Grades 3 and 4) tumors. Median survival for all patients from date of diagnosis was 31 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 45.8%. Grade (low/high) matched stage (low/high) in 45 of 54 patients (83%). Median survival for patients with low grade tumors was 66.8 months compared to 14.1 months in patients with high grade tumors. Median survival for low stage tumors was 91.1 months and for high stage tumors was 12.9 months. These differences in survival related to both tumor stage (P = 0.001) and grade (P = 0.004) were statistically significant by log-rank test. Fourteen of the 54 patients (25.9%) developed local recurrence and 29 (53.7%) developed distant metastases. The lung was the most common site of metastasis. Eighteen patients (33.3%) had or developed transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, which preceded the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper tract in seven cases and developed subsequently in 11 cases. Primary tumor stage by the new TNM classification is a better predictor of prognosis than tumor grade, although both variables are strongly predictive of patient course and survival. The advantages of the new TNM classification are discussed.\r"

Levels of beta carotene and alpha tocopherol varied for prostatic cancer patients by disease stage and by the period in the treatment sequence when blood was collected. This made any assessment of their association with prostatic cancer risk difficult. The mean level of serum retinol was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in prostatic cancer patients than in the controls. For serum retinol this difference did not appear to be attributable to age, stage of disease, period in which the blood was collected, or to several other potentially confounding factors. When the serum retinol level was considered in quintile classes, there was a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) trend of increased prostatic cancer risk associated with decreasing serum retinol levels.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical and histologic review of 25 patients with melanocytic lesions classified as desmoplastic malignant melanoma is reported. All of the lesions were located in sun-exposed sites. The average age was 61.2 years (range, 38 to 83), with a median age of 56. There were 14 female and 11 male patients. Desmoplastic malignant melanoma is a melanocytic and fibroblastic proliferation that occurs predominantly in the head and neck area. The bland constituent cells resemble fibroblasts and are often arranged in bundles or fascicles, which may be arrayed perpendicularly to the overlying epidermis. Enlarged and/or atypical cells are usually scattered among the spindled cells. Most, but not all, of the tumors (24 of 25 in this series) are associated with lentigo maligna or an atypical junctional melanocytic proliferation. Mitotic figures are always found within the constituent cells of the fibrous-appearing mass, and neurotropism may be present. Patients with desmoplastic melanoma typically present with a mass, which is occasionally associated with a pigmented lesion. The lesions in our series were deeply invasive to level IV or V. Lentigo maligna and a dermal fibroblastic-appearing mass containing atypical cells arranged in fascicles are the most common morphologic features found in desmoplastic melanoma. Follow-up data is available for 23 patients. The average length of follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 0.1 to 9 years). Eighteen patients were observed for 3 or more years. Twelve patients developed local recurrences, and five developed metastases; three of the patients with metastases had a local recurrence before the development of metastases. Three of the patients with metastatic melanoma died of tumor between 2 and 4 years after their initial excision. Eight of the 12 locally recurring lesions were either diagnosed initially as a benign lesion or histologic examination was not performed on the initial excision specimen. It appears that recurrence may be related to inadequate initial therapy.\r"

Ninety percent of patients were found to be colonized with Candida, with most of these colonizations present by day 14. The 30 patients exhibiting colonization with pseudohyphae received ketoconazole 400 mg daily by mouth. Of 20 patients in this group treated for 5 or more days, Candida organisms were eradicated in nine. Sixteen patients from the above group with persistent colonization on ketoconazole were treated by independent clinical decision for sustained fever and neutropenia with Amphotericin B, but only one responded by elimination of colonization. Seven of the 15 patients who did not initially receive ketoconazole developed Candida dissemination in contrast to two of 30 who received ketoconazole initially (P = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). No patient who initially had or acquired a negative cytology developed oral or disseminated candidiasis. Clinical oral candidiasis occurred in three patients, all of whom were receiving amphotericin B. Approximately 90% of these patients have or develop oral colonization with Candida organisms as identified by oral cytology. Those with colonization, both with and without pseudohyphae present, are at risk for dissemination. Amphotericin B does not eliminate colonization remaining after treatment with 400 mg of ketoconazole daily. More effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are needed to identify and eliminate Candida organisms and to prevent disseminated candidiasis in this population of patients.\r"

Colposcopically directed biopsies were taken from the cervix and vulva for histopathological diagnosis. 77 specimens were further analyzed immunohistochemically for the presence of HPV capsid antigen. In ten randomly selected cervical biopsies cellular DNA was dot blot hybridized with HPV 6/11 and 16/18 DNA probes. Genital warts were seen in 10 (7%) of the patients. Among the routine cytological smears, HPV infection was only reported in 3 (2%). In 87/142 (61%) of the cervical tissues koilocytes were found. A further 9/142 (6%) associated with CIN. Of the vulvar biopsies 91/145 (63%) contained koilocytes. A further 12/145 (8%) were associated with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV capsid proteins were detected in 35/77 (45%) of the cervical and in 20/41 (49%) of the vulva biopsies. All cervical DNA samples hybridized with probes for HPV 6/11 and two also reacted with the HPV 16/18 probes.

  ".W": "The original diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma (RM) was critically evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy in a retrospective series of 25 patients older than 40 years of age. Only two of the 25 patients (8%) were verified to have RM by strict criteria. By light microscopy, the true RM had a spindle or round cell appearance and were subtyped as embryonal RM, although some pleomorphism was present. Sarcomeric differentiation was revealed by electron microscopy, and desmin and muscle actin by immunohistochemistry. Both of these tumors arose in the urogenital organs, one in the urinary bladder and the other in the prostatic region. Both patients died within 3 months of the diagnosis. The other tumors not verified as RM were pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcomas (n = 17), ten of which were considered to represent malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or had desmin and/or muscle actin, and were verified as leiomyosarcomas by electron microscopy (n = 2). There were single cases of undifferentiated carcinoma, probable neuroendocrine carcinoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. The average survival for the non-RM tumor patients was 32 months. The results show that true RM do occur in the elderly, but they are very rare. Such tumors may have clinicopathologic properties similar to embryonal RM in children both in regard to the site of origin and to the histologic picture. True RM seems to carry a worse prognosis than other pleomorphic sarcomas, and this emphasizes the need for accurate diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1964 and 1987 ten patients with vaginal melanoma were treated at The University of Michigan Hospital. Five of the six patients who underwent radical surgery had adequate information concerning the first site of relapse, and in four of these five, pelvic sites or locoregional lymph nodes were the first sites of recurrent disease. One of these patients developed a 17-cm pelvic recurrence, which responded with a 75% reduction in size 3 months after completion of radiotherapy given in high individual fractions (400 cGy X 11). Three patients were managed with local resection, and all developed recurrent locoregional disease. One patient presented with metastatic disease. We conclude that locoregional control of vaginal melanoma is difficult to achieve with surgery alone. We hypothesize that preoperative radiotherapy to the pelvis (500 cGy X 6 given 3 days a week to the whole pelvis with subsequent consideration for a vaginal boost field) may improve the poor rate of locoregional control of vaginal melanoma that is seen when surgery alone is used.\r"

Due to the lack of sufficient clinical data, 27 patients were excluded from the study. Median time from excision of primary tumor to diagnosis of node metastases was 11 months. In 42 of 85 (49%) patients with truncal melanoma, the primary tumor was placed in the lymphatic water-shed areas. Two patients among this group showed bilateral simultaneous metastases to two different node groups. In the remaining 43 patients with truncal tumors located outside water-shed areas, node metastases developed in unexpected groups in seven (16%) patients. Of 22 patients with head and neck tumors, two (9%) patients demonstrated metastases to distant lymph node groups without metastases to the regional node basins.\r"

Atropine produced a significant increase in heart rate (HR) within 1 min in all patients studied; the HR increases in patients anaesthetized with halothane (37 +/- 11 beats.min-1, n = 37) or narcotic (34 +/- 12 beats.min-1, n = 30) were significantly greater than in those anaesthetized with enflurane (25 +/- 10 beats.min-1, n = 35; P less than 0.01) or epidural anaesthesia. Because of the presence of an acute cardiac sympathectomy, the patients who received cervical epidural anaesthesia were expected to have different responses to the atropine. However, there was no significant difference in the HR increases between the patient groups with cervical (19 +/- 12 beats.min-1, n = 32) and lumbar (22 +/- 8 beats.min-1, n = 35) epidural anaesthesia. Atropine also produced a small but significant increase in arterial pressure in all five groups of patients. These results suggest that the cardiac responses to atropine may differ depending on the individual anaesthetic agent used, and are likely dependent upon the agent's effect on autonomic nervous system activity.\r"

Eight healthy children (five to 14 years old) undergoing strabismus surgery under halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia with spontaneous ventilation were studied. The ORR was evoked by traction on the extrinsic muscles of the eye (four medial recti and four lateral recti). Slowing of the respiratory rate and/or shallow respiratory movements were observed in each patient. One patient developed apnoea of 20 seconds duration which forced the use of manually controlled ventilation. Intravenous atropine (0.01 mg.kg-1) reduced the incidence of positive OCR (to 37.5 per cent) but did not diminish the incidence of the ORR (100 per cent). Since the ORR may lead to hypercapnia and hypoxaemia, controlled ventilation is recommended for patients undergoing strabismus surgery at least immediately before and during the muscular traction. It is now clear that the ORR may be evoked by traction on the extrinsic muscles of the eye, may produce hypercapnia and hypoxaemia and so, may aggravate the consequences of the OCR.\r"

This prompted us to investigate the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone on tourniquet-induced ischaemia using mongrel dogs. After inflation of tourniquets to 600 mmHg on each thigh of the hind legs, one leg received an intravenous infusion of methyl-prednisolone, 3 mg.kg-1 dissolved in 20 ml of autologous blood. The other leg received the same amount of blood only, as a control. During two hours of tourniquet time and until 30 min after tourniquet deflation, venous blood was sampled five times from both hind legs for measurements of blood gas tensions (PvO2, PvCO2) and pH, lactic acid, creatinine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). During tourniquet ischaemia, PvO2 and pH dropped and PvCO2, lactic acid, CK, AST and LDH rose steadily and significantly in both groups of legs, indicating respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and muscle cell damage. However, those changes were significantly smaller in the methylprednisolone-treated legs. The beneficial effect of methylprednisolone could be attributed to its vasodilatory effect, cellular membrane stabilization and direct metabolic effect on skeletal muscle cells. Although the tourniquet-induced ischaemia in our study is slightly different from the clinical paradigm, the results suggest that high-dose methylprednisolone may provide a beneficial effect during tourniquet ischaemia.\r"

Ten animals received the lidocaine bolus and nine a similar volume of saline immediately before MCA occlusion. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded before and after the lidocaine bolus as well as continually after MCA occlusion. After six hours of vessel occlusion and without reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed and the brains fixed for histology. Prior to MCA occlusion, lidocaine caused a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in the amplitude of the major cortical component of the SEP (10 +/- 1.2 microV vs 6.0 +/- 1.3 microV). Latency was unchanged. In the lidocaine group, SEP's persisted in 40 per cent immediately following occlusion whereas they disappeared in all of the control animals (p less than 0.05). Gradual recovery occurred in both groups and there were no differences at the end of the experiment although the amplitudes tended to be greater in the lidocaine group. There were no statistically significant differences in the histological size or severity of the infarcts between the groups. Although infarct size was not reduced, transient sparing of the SEP suggests that further studies of lidocaine by continuous infusion in models of temporary focal cerebral ischaemia may be warranted.\r"

This episode of desaturation subsided with the removal of a 12 french oesophageal stethoscope which had been inserted following induction. Further attempts to re-insert this oesophageal probe led to repeated episodes of desaturation. The most likely cause of this desaturation was a reduction in pulmonary blood flow due to compression by the oesophageal probe of an aorto-pulmonary collateral posterior to the oesophagus.\r"

The Harrington rod was being manipulated at the same time as bone chips were being removed from the iliac crest. Although more common intraoperative events were presumed and treatment initiated, venous air embolism (VAE) was considered the aetiology of these events when a transient decrease in the end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and an increase in the end-tidal nitrogen (ETN2) was noted by mass spectrometry. This transient episode resolved within a relatively narrow window of time, and the case proceeded without further incident, including a wake-up test, to the conclusion of surgery.\r"

In the present study, the effects of Ang II infusion on CO and regional blood flow was determined by the microsphere technique in eight conscious, chronically catheterized dogs. Ang II was infused into both vertebral arteries at 0.33 and 1.0 ng/kg/min, and intravenously at 0.66, 2.0 and 5.0 ng/kg/min. Intravertebral infusion of Ang II at 0.33 ng/kg/min increased MAP by increasing CO without changing TPR or peripheral plasma Ang II concentration. MAP also was increased with intravertebral infusion of Ang II at 1.0 ng/kg/min, but this resulted from small increases in both CO and TPR. In contrast, intravenous infusion of Ang II at 2.0 and 5.0 ng/kg/min increased MAP by increasing TPR in association with a decrease in CO. The increase in CO with intravertebral infusion of Ang II at 0.33 ng/kg/min was distributed primarily to the muscles, kidneys, heart, and brain. Intravenous infusion of Ang II at 5.0 ng/kg/min and, to a lesser extent, 2.0 ng/kg/min decreased blood flow to the skin, splanchnic region, and kidneys. These data indicate that the increase in MAP produced by a low intravertebral dose of Ang II results from an increase in CO, which is distributed primarily to the muscle, kidney, heart, and brain. In contrast, the increase in MAP produced by a higher intravertebral dose of Ang II results from increases in CO and TPR. This latter action is apparently due to a peripheral action of Ang II to increase resistance in the skin, splanchnic, and renal circulations.\r"

Arterial segments with and without endothelium were cannulated and perfused with physiological salt solution. Adrenergic nerves were activated by transmural electrical field stimulation. Neurogenic vasoconstriction was significantly greater in segments without endothelium when compared with that of segments with endothelium. In segments with endothelium only, vasoconstriction was depressed when shear stress was increased by increasing the viscosity of the perfusate with dextran. Perfusion with methylene blue (2 X 10(-6) M), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, increased vasoconstriction in segments with endothelium only. In the presence of methylene blue, vasoconstriction was no longer different between segments with and without endothelium, and perfusion with dextran had no effect. In a perfusion-cascade system, perfusion with dextran of donor segments with but not without endothelium caused further relaxation of a contracted bioassay ring. These results suggest that shear stress on endothelial cells modulates adrenergic vasoconstriction by augmenting release of endothelial cell-derived vasodilators.\r"

Lungs of chronically prepared awake sheep were imaged after infusion of 111In-neutrophils and 131I-fibrinogen. Thrombin (80 units/kg) was administered to induce fibrin sequestration in the lung. One group received tranexamic acid (4 mg/kg i.v.) to inhibit fibrinolysis, and the control group received a saline infusion. Thrombin infusion increased both 131I-fibrinogen and 111In-neutrophils in the lung, but the increases were greater and more prolonged in the fibrinolysis-inhibited group. We examined the adherence of isolated neutrophils to fibrin matrix to investigate how neutrophil-fibrin interactions could mediate neutrophil sequestration. Unstimulated neutrophils showed a 37.5 +/- 3.1% adherence to fibrin in contrast to a 3.9 +/- 0.4% neutrophil adherence to endothelium and a 6.5 +/- 0.5% adherence to agarose. Neutrophil adherence to fibrin increased to 81.7 +/- 6.2% with activation by phorbol myristate acetate (10(-8) M) and was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the beta-chain of the CD18 leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein. The findings indicate that retention of pulmonary fibrin microthrombi is associated with increased lung uptake of neutrophils. Fibrin serves as a substrate for neutrophil adherence, and this adherence is mediated by expression of the CD18 glycoprotein complex on neutrophils. Fibrin sequestration in the lung may contribute to lung vascular injury by inducing pulmonary neutrophil uptake.\r"

Using sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (PAGE), we resolved five isoforms: TnT1, TnT2, TnT3, TnT4, and TnT5. TnT1 had the slowest electrophoretic mobility and TnT5 the fastest. The predominant isoforms were TnT2, TnT3, and TnT4. The relative amounts of TnT2, TnT3, TnT4, and TnT5 were examined in myocardium from three age-groups: 3 days (Group 1), 21-22 days (Group 2), and 99-109 days (Group 3). The amount of TnT2 relative to the total amount of TnT (determined by the ratio of the areas under the densitometric curves) decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) with age from 42 +/- 4% in Group 1 to 25 +/- 3% in Group 3. In contrast, the relative amount of TnT4 increased with age from 23 +/- 2% in Group 1 to 33 +/- 4% in Group 3 (p less than 0.01). The relative amounts of the other two isoforms change biphasically with development: TnT3 decreased from Group 1 to Group 2 and increased from Group 2 to Group 3. TnT5, a minor isoform, increased from Group 1 to Group 2 and decreased from Group 2 to Group 3. These developmental changes in troponin T expression may account for some of the maturational changes observed in the physiological and biochemical properties of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is known to enhance the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine (NE). In the present study, this interaction was investigated using isolated rabbit femoral artery rings mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction. Exposure to 3 x 10(-10) M Ang II caused a contraction that was less than 5% of the maximal response to NE. In the presence of Ang II, the NE dose-response curve shifted to the left twofold and the maximal response was not changed. The calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, 1 x 10(-7) M, caused a modest inhibition of the response to NE in either the presence or absence of Ang II. In contrast, nifedipine abolished the leftward shift of the NE dose-response curve caused by Ang II. Femoral arteries were pretreated with benextramine to cause partial alpha-adrenoceptor inactivation. The maximal contractile response to NE in these tissues was between 20% and 40% of that in control vessels, indicating that alpha-adrenoceptor reserve had been eliminated. In benextramine-pretreated vessels, the presence of 3 x 10(-10) M Ang II caused a modest leftward shift of the NE dose-response curve but increased the maximal responses to all NE concentrations by 200% to 800%. Nifedipine caused a modest inhibition of the response to NE in the absence of Ang II. In contrast, the enhanced response to NE in the presence of Ang II was nearly abolished. These results support our conclusions that 1) Ang II enhances the vasoconstrictor response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, 2) the magnitude of enhancement is greater under conditions of reduced alpha-receptor reserve, and 3) calcium channel activation plays a major role in the amplified response.\r"

Cerebral cortical tissue was allografted into the cheek pouch of the hamster so that cerebral parenchymal vessels could be studied. The vascular morphology was characterized by a large number of looping vessels. The ultrastructural examination indicated viable cerebral tissue containing typical vessels, that is, \"tight\" junctions, not like those of the cheek pouch. Also, the microvasculature was impermeable to 150, 70, and 20 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans. Angiotensin II and norepinephrine caused constriction of the cerebral vessels whereas adenosine caused dilation. Isoproterenol did not affect cerebral arterioles; however, it dilated cheek pouch arterioles. Thus, this preparation provides a satisfactory model for studying the living cerebral microcirculation.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the response of ventricular muscle from adult and neonatal rats to hypercapnic acidosis. In adult muscle, acidosis caused an initial rapid fall of developed tension to 30 +/- 5% of control (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). However, tension recovered slowly to a steady state that was 56 +/- 6% of control. In neonatal muscle, acidosis caused a significantly smaller initial fall in tension to 43 +/- 3% (n = 8, p less than 0.05), but the tension then showed a subsequent slower fall to a steady state that was 29 +/- 4% of control, significantly less than in the adult (p less than 0.01). We have attempted to identify the mechanisms underlying these differences in response. In detergent-skinned myofibrils, reducing the pH from 7.0 to 6.5 caused a reduction in the pCa50 of 0.61 units in the adult muscle, but only 0.27 units in the neonatal ventricular muscle. Myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity in neonatal ventricular muscle is thus less susceptible to the effects of acidic pH than that of adult muscle. Since intracellular pH decreases rapidly on application of increased external CO2, these results are consistent with the finding that, initially, developed tension in neonatal muscles is less sensitive to the effects of acidosis. Sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis of myofibrillar preparations from adult and neonatal rats demonstrated differences in thin filament proteins, including troponin I, which may underlie the observed differences in Ca2+ sensitivity. In adult rat ventricular muscles, the slow recovery of tension during acidosis is associated with an increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients to 263 +/- 34% of control (n = 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the change in the instantaneous diastolic left coronary pressure-flow relation (DPFR) when the pressure surrounding the heart (SHP), right heart pressure (RHP), and left heart pressure (LHP) were systematically varied. Eight excised and maximally vasodilated canine hearts placed in an air-tight chamber were used. To obtain a capacitance-free DPFR, coronary perfusion pressure was slowly decreased (about 2 mm Hg/sec) during a prolonged diastole. The zero-flow pressure (Pf = 0) and the slope of the DPFR were analyzed. The mean values of the slope did not change significantly throughout the interventions. The mean value of Pf = 0 in the control state (SHP = RHP = LHP = 0 mm Hg) was 6.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, n = 8), significantly higher than the venous outflow pressure, RHP (p less than 0.001), and the other two pressures (p less than 0.001). When SHP was raised to 15 and 30 mm Hg, while the other pressures remained at 0 mm Hg, the mean values of Pf = 0 increased to 20.9 +/- 2.4 and 35.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0005, respectively, vs. control). The mean values of Pf = 0 when only RHP was elevated to 15 and 30 mm Hg were 16.0 +/- 1.5 and 29.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0005 vs. control). On elevation of LHP to 15 and 30 mm Hg, the mean values of Pf = 0 were 12.0 +/- 2.8 and 17.3 +/- 3.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01 vs. control). When both SHP and LHP were almost evenly elevated to about 15 and 30 mm Hg, the mean values of Pf = 0 were raised to 22.0 +/- 2.9 and 35.3 +/- 3.2 mm Hg, respectively. These mean values were not significantly different from those when only SHP was elevated to the comparable levels. The observation that Pf = 0 exceeded RHP in the control state and that RHP, which was elevated above the preceding Pf = 0, was identical with the present Pf = 0 supports the vascular waterfall mechanism when RHP is low. Furthermore, the evidence that the degree of DPFR shift was almost linearly dependent on the SHP level rather than on the LHP level indicates that the pressure on the epicardial side is one of the factors that determines the pressure at the top of the vascular waterfall.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular/vascular coupling dynamics and regional hemodynamics of five hypertensive baboons with concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (mean arterial pressure +/- SD, 148 +/- 16 mm Hg; LV mass/body weight ratio 3.42 +/- 0.8) were compared with five normotensive controls (mean arterial pressure 89 +/- 3 mm Hg; LV mass/body wt ratio 2.73 +/- 0.5) at different mean arterial pressures. Ventricular/vascular dynamics were assessed by aortic input impedance, pulsatile/total power ratio, effective arterial elastance and compliance from a three-element Windkessel \"lumped\" model of the circulation. Regional arterial dynamics were assessed by pulse-wave velocities and local reflection coefficients. Systemic arterial compliance was similarly decreased with elevated pressure in both groups but was significantly more reduced for the hypertensive group compared with control animals at control (0.49 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.09 ml/mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and acutely lowered arterial pressure (0.62 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.41 +/- 0.24 ml/mm Hg, respectively). Changes in compliance were paralleled by differences in effective arterial elastance derived from cineventriculographic pressure-volume ratios. Regional foot-foot and apparent phase pulse-wave velocities were significantly increased for distal aortic segments of the hypertensive animals during elevated pressures compared with controls (cff, 17.5 +/- 7.5 vs. 8.7 +/- 3.0 m/sec; p less than 0.05). Histology of the aorta revealed significant increases in collagen content (microgram/mg dry wt) from proximal to distal aortic segments (27 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 6; p less than 0.005) in hypertensive animals but not in controls (27 +/- 2 vs. 32 +/- 6; NS). With pharmacological normalization of systemic arterial pressures, hypertensive baboons developed aortic wave speeds similar to controls but manifested significantly reduced compliance compared with controls. In contrast, with acute elevations of pressure, systemic arterial aortic compliances were similar for both groups, but distal pulse-wave velocities were significantly increased for hypertensive animals compared with controls. We conclude that measures of ventricular/vascular coupling and arterial dynamics are determined by both the level of arterial pressure and the physical characteristics of the cardiovascular system in chronic systemic hypertension and pressure overload ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study in conscious rats, we tested the hypothesis that substance P, a central pressor peptide and a potential transmitter substance of pain pathways, could be involved in the cardiovascular defense reaction that is typically associated with unpleasant sensory stimuli. The hemodynamic responses to centrally administered substance P were pharmacologically characterized. The increases in blood pressure and heart rate after intracerebroventricular injections of substance P were accompanied by mesenteric and renal vasoconstriction and hind limb vasodilation (pulsed-Doppler flow probes). The pressor and vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated by peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin but were not influenced by blockade of vascular vasopressin receptors with d(CH2)5Tyr(Me) arginine vasopressin (AVP). Cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol abolished the tachycardic and reduced the pressor responses. Substance P-induced hind limb vasodilation was not sensitive to intravenous atropine but was largely prevented by peripheral beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118,551. Thus, the substance P-induced pressor effects are mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstriction and beta 1-adrenergic cardiac stimulation, whereas the hind limb vasodilation is mainly due to beta 2-adrenergic stimulation. Substance P dose-dependently (0.01-10 micrograms i.c.v.) released oxytocin but not vasopressin or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. High doses reduced basal ACTH levels. Together with the hemodynamic responses, a behavioral arousal reaction was observed, which included increased locomotion, grooming, scratching, and skin biting. Our results demonstrate that a neuropeptide can induce classic cardiovascular defense reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study was intended to define the interrelation among endocardial flow, endocardial function, and coronary arterial pressure during spontaneous autoregulation in the left ventricle of chronically instrumented unanesthetized dogs. Steady-state sonomicrometric measurements of regional function and epicardial coronary artery pressure were used to determine the lower pressure limit of endocardial autoregulation while global indexes of myocardial demand remained constant. Transmural wall thickening in the circumflex bed remained unchanged (+/- 5% of control values) until coronary pressure fell below 39 +/- 5.6 (SD) mm Hg. Endocardial segment shortening was similarly constant until coronary pressure fell below 42 +/- 7.4 mm Hg. There was no significant change in endocardial flow as coronary pressure was reduced over the autoregulatory plateau from 84 to 49 mm Hg (1.05-0.99 ml/min/g, p = NS). Below the critical pressure limits, small additional reductions in pressure were associated with marked reductions in both endocardial flow and function. The coronary pressure-function relation was linear as well as steep in this range for both wall thickening (r = 0.94 +/- 0.05) and segment shortening (r = 0.96 +/- 0.03). Although the relation between endocardial flow and function showed more variability than pressure-function relations at low pressures, wall thickening reductions and endocardial flow reductions related on a nearly one-to-one basis. The present study establishes that the coronary pressure-function relation can be used to define the lower limit of endocardial autoregulation. It also indicates that the lower pressure limit of endocardial autoregulation is considerably less than in anesthetized animals (40 vs. 70 mm Hg) and that steady-state flow above this limit is controlled more tightly. Although these differences may relate to systemic hemodynamics, it seems likely that general anesthesia and/or acute surgical instrumentation alter coronary autoregulation under at least some experimental circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Epicardial phenol application or transmural myocardial infarction in dogs produces sympathetic denervation of myocardium apical to the site of the intervention. Because efferent denervation is probably postganglionic, reinnervation most likely occurs but has not been shown. We investigated whether 123I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a norepinephrine analogue taken up by sympathetic nerve terminals, could provide a scintigraphic image that would detect apical sympathetic denervation and possible reinnervation. Dogs underwent MIBG scintigraphic imaging at various times after phenol application or transmural myocardial infarction. The results of MIBG scintigraphy were correlated with electrophysiological responses obtained during ansae subclaviae and norepinephrine stimulation to establish the presence of neural denervation and reinnervation. Apical defects in the MIBG scan, which were associated with either normal perfusion by thallium or a smaller-sized defect, were found consistently in dogs that had apical sympathetic innervation. MIBG scintigraphic images returned to normal after 14 weeks (mean) at a time when reinnervation was shown to have occurred. Thus, the results of MIBG scintigraphy correlated accurately with the presence of denervation and reinnervation established by neuroelectrophysiological testing. Supersensitive refractory period shortening in response to norepinephrine infusion was present after denervation and persisted for more than 3 weeks after scintigraphic and electrophysiological evidence of reinnervation. Conclusions are that 1) MIBG can be used noninvasively to determine the presence of regional myocardial efferent sympathetic denervation and subsequent reinnervation, 2) reinnervation occurs after phenol application or transmural myocardial infarction, and 3) denervation supersensitivity persists even after reinnervation occurs.\r"

  ".W": "With standard microelectrode techniques, electrical activity of cells in the epicardial border zones of infarcts in the canine heart were studied. Either automaticity or triggered activity (or both) occurred in each of the 12 preparations studied from 24-hour infarcts. One 24-hour preparation had continuous activity indistinguishable from low-potential (abnormal) automaticity. This automaticity was not effected by flecainide 1-5 mg/l. Two other 24-hour subepicardial muscle preparations also were automatic. However, nine preparations from the subepicardium were not automatic during superfusion with standard Tyrode's solution. Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity could be induced in all of these preparations by treatment with catecholamines. The amplitude of these DADs was directly related to the stimulus rate of the train of impulses used to elicit them, and their coupling interval was inversely related to this rate of stimulation. Triggered activity occurred from maximal diastolic potentials of -58 to -88 mV in the 24-hour infarct zone preparations. In seven preparations from 72-96-hour infarct zones, the epicardial muscle cells did not show triggered activity after treatment with catecholamines. In one preparation from a 72-hour infarct, however, 3-5-mV DADs occurred. No DADs or triggered impulses occurred in subepicardial muscle from normal, noninfarcted hearts. Thus, triggered impulses and low-potential automaticity could contribute to arrhythmias occurring in the canine heart 24 hours after coronary ligation.\r"

Single pulses and multiple pulses required for penetration or perforation of the arterial wall were applied with 16 nsec pulse width and 5 J/cm2/pulse energy fluence. The total fluorescence of irradiated and ablated tissue was analyzed in real-time mode by means of spectroscopy. Each laser pulse produced one spectrum that was characteristic of the composition of the tissue layer, which was ablated. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated a broad-continuum emission between 300 and 700 nm with peak fluorescence of equal intensity at wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm (ratio, 1.004 +/- 0.087) for normal media layers. Atheromas without calcification (lipid, fibrous, and mixed) were found with spectral maxima at the same wavelengths but with significantly reduced intensity at 460 nm (ratio, 1.765 +/- 0.263; p less than 0.001). In contrast to this broad-continuum fluorescence, calcified plaques displayed multiple-line emission with the most prominent peaks at wavelengths of 397, 442, 450, 461, 528, and 558 nm. These fluorescence criteria identified the histologically classified target tissue precisely. Histological examination of the corresponding arterial layers indicated sharply delineated and circumscribed tissue ablation. These results indicate that simultaneous tissue identification (diagnosis) and ablation (treatment) by excimer laser irradiation is feasible under strict laboratory conditions. We conclude that this principle demonstrates the potential for laser beam control by means of target-specific ablation.\r"

In the acute group (17 dogs), platelets were injected 24 hours after thrombus induction. In the chronic group (16 dogs), platelets were injected 4-8 days after thrombus induction. \"Sham\" thoracotomies were performed on seven additional control dogs who did not receive thrombin injections. Analog and blood pool-corrected 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy images were obtained 4-72 hours later. Closed-chest two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before thoracotomy and repeated at the time of scintigraphy. The location and size of each thrombus were verified at autopsy. Two-dimensional echocardiography detected three of 17 acute (mean volume, 1.2 +/- 1.0 cc) and three of 10 chronic (mean volume, 0.4 +/- 0.3 cc; p less than 0.025) left atrial appendage thrombi. 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy detected all 17 acute thrombi but only two of 10 chronic thrombi. The measured radioactivity levels of the excised thrombi were 1,949 +/- 1,665 cpm/clot/dose in group 1 and 228 +/- 213 cpm/clot/dose in group 2 (p less than 0.005). In this model, 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy was able to detect acute left atrial appendage thrombi that could not be identified by two-dimensional echocardiography. Both techniques showed poor sensitivity for detection of chronic thrombi. The decline in sensitivity of 111In-labeled platelet scintigraphy for detection of older thrombi is probably due to diminished labeled-platelet incorporation.\r"

Indo 1-loaded hearts were illuminated at 360 nm, and fluorescence was recorded simultaneously at 400 and 550 nm from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. The F400/F550 ratio was calculated by an analog circuit, which allowed cancellation of optical motion artifact. Resulting calcium transients demonstrated a rapid upstroke and slow decay similar to those recorded in isolated ventricular myocytes. Global ischemia rapidly suppressed contraction, but it produced a concurrent increase in the systolic and diastolic levels of the calcium transients, together with an increase in the duration of the peak. The effects of ischemia were reversed by reperfusion, inhibited by verapamil, and mimicked by perfusion of nonischemic hearts with acidified (CO2-rich) solution. In addition to elevation of the calcium transients, ischemia caused a pattern of intracellular calcium alternans that was discernible after 2-3 minutes. The pattern of alternans was stable at a given epicardial site, but it could be out of phase at different sites. Similar nonuniformities were observed in contraction strength and in the duration of monophasic action potentials recorded immediately adjacent to the fiber-optic probe. Abnormalities in intracellular calcium may be a causal factor in the loss of electrical and mechanical synchrony in the acutely ischemic heart.\r"

  ".W": "The primary role of the heart is to provide energy for the circulatory transport of oxygen (O2) to cells at rates commensurate with their metabolic activity. At rest, even a \"sick\" heart may be capable of transporting O2 adequately. But during exercise, the increase in O2 required by muscle cells demands that their blood flow be increased. The supply of O2 needed to meet the O2 requirement for muscle mitochondrial high-energy phosphate generation during exercise is a critical function of the circulation. Thus, the adequacy of cardiovascular function can be estimated, noninvasively, from the pattern of O2 uptake in response to an exercise stimulus. While arterial O2 tension (PaO2) is dependent on pulmonary function (except for intracardiac right-to-left shunt), the mass transfer of O2 (VO2) between the cells and lungs depends on pulmonary blood flow (i.e., cardiac output) and O2 concentration difference between the pulmonary arterial and pulmonary venous blood, C(a-v)O2 (Fick principle). Thus, VO2 in the first 15 seconds of exercise can be used to describe the initial increase in pulmonary blood flow and stroke volume, while the subsequent rise in VO2 results from the further increase in VO2 in response to work rate increase are used to detect circulatory disturbances. Also, the rate of CO2 output (VCO2) has been valuable in the assessment of cardiovascular function when related to VO2. Inadequate O2 availability results in anaerobic metabolism, causing increased muscle lactic acid production. At the pH of cell water, most of the hydrogen ions produced with lactate are buffered by bicarbonate. The CO2 generated by the buffering reaction (22 ml for each milliequivalent) causes a net increase in VCO2 relative to VO2 at the work rate at which buffering begins. This provides a useful estimate of the anaerobic threshold. Thus, study of the dynamic coupling of external to cellular respiration during a work rate stimulus provides valuable, direct, and noninvasive information about cardiovascular mechanisms in health and disease.\r"

Over a mean follow-up of 6.2 months, there were three early deaths (less than 30 days) and eight late deaths. Nine patients underwent subsequent aortic valve surgery, and four had repeat balloon valvuloplasty. Doppler echocardiography revealed a reduction in aortic valve mean gradient from 48 +/- 18 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg after the procedure (p less than 0.0001) but a return to 46 +/- 16 mm Hg at follow-up (p less than 0.05). The aortic valve area increased from 0.54 +/- 0.15 to 0.85 +/- 0.23 cm2 after the procedure (p less than 0.0001), but there was a significant decrease to 0.67 +/- 0.19 cm2 at follow-up (p less than 0.05). Of patients free of aortic valve operation or death after 30 days after the procedure, 76% were severely symptomatic before the procedure as compared with 38% at follow-up. In patients undergoing percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty, there is a continued high short-term mortality and a significant incidence of restenosis over short-term follow-up. Nonetheless, a subset of patients do experience sustained clinical improvement from this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five consecutive patients with an overt accessory pathway, all but two suffering from arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, reciprocating tachycardia, or both), underwent attempted transcatheter ablation (fulguration) of their accessory pathway. Thirty-three patients had been treated with a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.4 antiarrhythmic drugs. A standard bipolar catheter was positioned on the internal surface of the right or left atrioventricular anulus with 1) a subclavian approach of the right cardiac cavities in 29 patients with right-sided accessory pathway (n = 27) or left posteroseptal accessory pathway (n = 2), 2) a patent foramen ovale in five patients (two with a left posterolateral accessory pathway and three with a left parietal accessory pathway), and a transseptal catheterism (one patient with a left parietal accessory pathway). Cathodic shocks (mean, 4.3 shocks/patient) with a mean cumulative energy of 690 J enabled the ablation (disappearance of both anterograde and retrograde conduction) of the accessory pathway in 32 patients with a follow-up ranging from 1 to 32 months (mean, 10 +/- 8 months). Two of the remaining three accessory pathways were impaired: one pathway became intermittent, the anterograde effective refractory period of the second pathway increased from 260 to 410 msec, and the third pathway was slightly impaired. This latter patient is the only one who still requires therapy, with a single antiarrhythmic drug. All others are free of arrhythmias and require no therapy. Not using coronary sinus catheterism inclusive of its os has led to only a few, benign side effects. Only one third-degree atrioventricular block occurred in a posteroseptal accessory pathway ablation. Three cases of patients with incessant reciprocating tachycardia involving a further successful ablation occurred at the beginning of our experience. The best area for ablation is, in our opinion, the recording site for the Kent-bundle activity (18 of 35 patients), but a meticulous mapping of the atrioventricular anulus during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia makes ablation possible when the shortest ventriculoatrial time (V-A') can be recorded with reliability (mean, 85 +/- 18 msec). Such a procedure is an alternative to surgical ablation regardless of the location of the accessory pathway--not only posteroseptally.\r"

We have examined the relation among BRS, several clinical cardiovascular variables, and subsequent mortality in 78 patients below the age of 65 years who have had a first myocardial infarction. BRS was assessed by calculating the regression line relating phenylephrine-induced increases in systolic blood pressure to the attendant changes in the RR interval. A reduced BRS primarily reflects an impairment in the vagal efferent component of the baroreceptor reflexes. The BRS of the entire population was 7.8 +/- 4.9 msec/mm Hg. BRS was lower among patients with an inferior myocardial infarction (6.1 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 5.8 msec/mm Hg, p = 0.03), with a three- versus a one-vessel disease (4.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 7.1 +/- 3.1 msec/mm Hg, p = 0.04), and with episodes of ventricular tachycardia (5.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 8.3 +/- 5.1, p = 0.03). There was no correlation between BRS and left ventricular ejection fraction or with mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at peak exercise, but a correlation (r = 0.35, p less than 0.001) was present with exercise tolerance.

  ".W": "To improve the performance of exercise stress testing in the diagnosis of effort angina while minimizing risks of serious complications, we evaluated an impulse response of ST changes, which is a transient ST response resulting from a hypothetical, strenuous-impulselike exercise, without actually imposing the strenuous load. To obtain the impulse response, subjects walked intermittently according to a computer-generated random binary sequence on a treadmill for 20 minutes (with a constant speed of 1.7 mph and a slope of 10%). We used Fourier transform for beat-to-beat changes in ST level and the binary sequence of exercise. We then determined the transfer function by taking the ratio of Fourier transformed ST level to exercise over the frequency range of 0.5 through 5.0 cycles/min. Converting the transfer function to the time domain yielded the impulse response of ST change. The subjects consisted of 49 patients (60 +/- 9 years) with effort angina, 13 patients with atypical chest pain (56 +/- 9 years), and 30 healthy, male volunteers (23 +/- 7 years). In 82 subjects (89%), the ST impulse response showed an initial depression followed by a smooth, gradual restoration toward the preexercise ST level (type I response). The average duration of the initial depression was 8 +/- 3 seconds in the healthy volunteers, whereas it was significantly prolonged to 23 +/- 14 seconds in effort angina (p less than 0.05). The depression in patients with atypical chest pain was not significantly different from that in the healthy volunteers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients underwent left ventricular angiography (n = 13), surgery (n = 11), or both angiography and surgery (n = 10). Nine patients had only mitral valve replacement, four patients had both mitral and aortic valve replacement, and one patient had mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valve replacement. There were 16 biological and four mechanical prostheses. The degree of mitral regurgitation was graded by both transthoracic and transesophageal color Doppler according to the area of the regurgitant jet visualized and was compared with a three-point classification of mitral regurgitation by left ventricular angiography judged by observers blinded to the echocardiographic results. All transesophageal studies were performed without complication and were well tolerated. The pathological morphology of the mitral prosthesis was additionally or more clearly visualized by transesophageal two-dimensional imaging and subsequently proven at surgery in three patients with flail leaflets and one patient with a vegetation compared with images obtained by the transthoracic approach. Valvular regurgitation was graded by the transthoracic approach as absent in four patients, mild in two patients, moderate in five patients, and severe in only three patients. The transesophageal assessment showed absence of mitral regurgitation in two patients, moderate regurgitation in two patients, and severe regurgitation in 10 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although other surgical approaches have been proposed, current methods to assess their effect on left ventricular function are not adequate. The purpose of the present study was to quantitatively define regional systolic function in patients with LVA and to assess acute changes in regional function after standard repair. Seven patients underwent resection of an anteroapical LVA. Intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography was performed off cardiopulmonary bypass immediately before and after resection. In all patients, short-axis views at the papillary muscle (apex) level showed anteroseptal paradox and distorted geometry, whereas at the mitral valve (base), symmetric wall motion and geometry were preserved. Videotaped echo images were divided into octants by a floating axis fitted to internal landmarks. Myocardial area and midwall perimeter were obtained for each octant, and wall thickness was calculated at end diastole (ED), isovolumetric systole (IS), and end systole (ES). Wall thickening (delta t) for each segment was calculated as the percent increase in thickness from ED and averaged for all seven patients. At the apex level before resection, isovolumetric thinning occurred in the aneurysm as well as bordering segments, with delta t ranging from -17 +/- 5% (+/- SEM) in the anteroseptal segment to 12 +/- 6% posterolaterally (p less than 0.05). The isovolumetric bulge was followed by late-systolic thickening, however, with delta t ranging from 13 +/- 7% to 27 +/- 8% (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia was inducible in 17 of 18 patients with an accessory connection, and an atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia was inducible in four of six patients without accessory connection. After administration of propafenone, the sinus cycle length decreased. Intra-arterial, intranodal, and His-ventricle intervals and QRS duration increased. The atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and anterograde and retrograde effective refractory periods of the atrioventricular node increased. The cycle length at which nodal second-degree block occurred increased. Of 18 patients with accessory connection, propafenone prolonged retrograde conduction in all, blocked anterograde conduction in five, and prolonged it in six. The drug terminated the orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia in all 17 patients and the atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in three of four patients. In three of four patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and in 15 of 17 patients with orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia, the tachycardia was no longer inducible or nonsustained after propafenone. A follow-up of 26 +/- 10 months revealed that the drug when orally administered to all patients prevented recurrences of tachycardia in 15 of 18 patients with and in four of six patients without accessory connection. The results of short-term drug testing with propafenone predict the response to long-term oral therapy with this drug.\r"

Monitoring was performed after withdrawal of antianginal medications, and prospective follow-up was obtained on routine medical care as prescribed by physicians who were unaware of monitor results. Forty-nine patients (57%) had a total of 426 episodes of ST segment depression; only 60 episodes (14%) were associated with symptoms of angina or an equivalent. During a mean follow-up of 12.5 +/- 7.5 months, there were two cardiac deaths, four myocardial infarctions, four hospitalizations for unstable angina, and 11 revascularization procedures required for new or worsening symptoms in 15 patients. All but one of these events (a hospitalization for unstable angina) occurred in the group of patients with ST segment depression on monitoring (p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, and clinical descriptions of angina, the presence of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring was a significant predictor of outcome, while exercise test characteristics were not. Therefore, ischemia detected by ambulatory monitoring was common in patients with stable symptoms of coronary artery disease, and its presence identified a high-risk group for the development of subsequent unfavorable outcomes while on routine medical therapies.\r"

Eleven episodes of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia began after a single ventricular premature depolarization (VPD), three episodes after two VPDs, and two episodes after five VPDs. By comparison, only four episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia were induced with a single VPD. Each episode of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia was initiated by a late coupled VPD (RR':QT ratio greater than 1.0). The VPD was often morphologically similar to the ensuing ventricular tachycardia (eight of 11 episodes that began after a single VPD). No correlation was found between the modes of initiation of spontaneous and induced ventricular tachycardia. We hypothesize that concealed decremental slow conduction, reflected in the long coupling intervals of VPDs initiating ventricular tachycardia, is of critical importance in initiating ventricular tachycardia. We conclude that major differences exist in the timing and number of VPDs associated with the onsets of spontaneous and induced sustained ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The studies, which were spread over a follow-up period of up to 601 days, were carried out invasively with temporary leads as well as noninvasively with the implanted pacemakers and chest wall inhibition. The overdrive pacing rate was increased in steps of 10 beats/min, and the pacing duration was 2 minutes at each level. Ten out of 11 patients had a reliable ventricular escape rhythm; in the remaining patient, consistently no subsidiary pacemaker function was observed up to 10 seconds. In 83% of the studies, incremental ventricular overdrive stimulation caused progressive suppression of ventricular impulse formation with exponential increase in ventricular recovery time and progressive postrecovery subsidiary pacemaker depression. In the remaining 17%, ventricular recovery time showed a heterogeneous response to overdrive stimulation--as possible cause alterations in the sympathetic tone and limitations attributable to the method used are discussed. The results of this study demonstrate a rate-dependent overdrive suppression of subsidiary ventricular pacemaker tissue. This can be of clinical importance in patients with complete heart block and rate-adaptive pacemakers because sudden pacemaker failure or temporary pacemaker inhibition at high stimulation rates may cause Stokes-Adams attacks not reproducible at lower pacing rates.\r"

Postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP), which increases activator calcium, could lead to further deterioration of LV relaxation. The influence of PESP on LV filling dynamics was, therefore, investigated in normal controls and in patients with LV hypertrophy caused by AS or by HCM. LV hemodynamics and LV hemodynamic relaxation indexes were determined during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and after PESP. LV pressures were recorded by micromanometer tip catheters (controls, n = 10; AS, n = 17; HCM, n = 11). Simultaneous mitral flow Doppler echocardiograms were obtained in patients with LV hypertrophy (AS, n = 8, HCM, n = 5). Despite significant increases of LV dP/dtmax after PESP in all three study groups, PESP affected LV hemodynamic relaxation indexes differently. The time constant of LV pressure decay (TPB) derived from exponential curve fits with nonzero asymptote pressure remained unaltered after PESP in normal controls, rose from 62 +/- 17 to 74 +/- 21 msec (p less than 0.02) in patients with AS, and rose from 74 +/- 18 to 84 +/- 19 msec (p less than 0.02) in patients with HCM. Early diastolic LV pressure decay was measured by phi (phase of the first harmonic of a Fourier transform applied to the diastolic LV pressure waves) and by t (time interval from LV dP/dtmin to LV minimum diastolic pressure). After PESP, phi remained unaltered in normal controls but decreased in AS from 42.8 +/- 19.1 degrees to 24.0 +/- 28.8 degrees (p less than 0.001) and in HCM from 39.7 +/- 15.4 degrees to 26.9 +/- 15.7 degrees (p less than 0.001). Similarly, t was unchanged after PESP in normal controls but prolonged in AS from 146 +/- 48 to 205 +/- 86 msec (p less than 0.001) and in HCM from 168 +/- 40 to 208 +/- 53 msec (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because a given increase in afterload does not consistently produce the same degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, we evaluated several clinical, hemodynamic, and endocrine factors that are prone to modify the adaptation of left ventricular structure in patients with mild essential hypertension (World Health Organization stages I or II). Dietary salt intake assessed by sodium excretion over 24 hours was a powerful determinant of posterior wall thickness (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001), relative wall thickness (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001), and left ventricular mass (r = 0.37, p less than 0.05). In contrast, diastolic pressure, body mass index, hematocrit, and epinephrine were found to be weaker determinants of left ventricular structure (r = 0.31-0.40, p less than 0.05). A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that sodium excretion was the strongest predictor for posterior wall thickness (p less than 0.02) and relative wall thickness (p less than 0.05) independent of the other examined variables. These results identify dietary salt intake as a strong determinant of cardiac structural adaptation to a persistent increase in arterial pressure. Consequently, a high salt intake might aggravate and, conversely, dietary salt restriction might prevent (or at least mitigate) the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

The clinical and pathophysiological implications of our previous findings prompted the present study, which addressed three major questions: 1) Is, indeed, analysis of BRS after MI a specific and sensitive marker for sudden death-risk stratification? 2) Does MI modify BRS? 3) Does analysis of BRS before MI provide information about outcome during ischemic episodes occurring after MI? An anterior MI was produced in 301 dogs, and 4 weeks later, a 2-minute circumflex coronary artery occlusion beginning during the last minute of an exercise stress test could be performed in 192 animals. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 106 (55%) dogs (susceptible to sudden death), whereas 86 (45%) dogs (resistant to sudden death) survived. BRS was assessed by the phenylephrine method and was expressed by the regression line relating RR intervals to blood-pressure changes. BRS was significantly lower among susceptible than among resistant dogs (9.1 +/- 6.0 vs. 17.7 +/- 6.5 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). The risk for sudden death increased from 20% (15 of 73 dogs) for a BRS greater than 15 msec/mm Hg to 91% (62 of 68 dogs) for a BRS less than 9 msec/mm Hg (p less than 0.001). An internal control study in 55 animals showed that BRS was reduced 4 weeks after MI compared with control conditions (13.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 17.8 +/- 6.6 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and that a reduction occurred in 73% of animals. Susceptible dogs and those that spontaneously died after MI had a lower BRS even before the MI (16.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 22.2 +/- 6.2 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.001). The risk for sudden death after MI increased from 35% (nine of 26 dogs) for a BRS before MI greater than 20 msec/mm Hg to 85% (17 of 20 dogs) for a BRS before MI less than 14 msec/mm Hg (p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that the presence of a reduced BRS is associated with a greater susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation during subsequent ischemic episodes. In the majority of dogs, BRS is reduced after an MI. The results in 192 conscious dogs with a healed MI indicate that analysis of BRS is a powerful tool for risk stratification not only after, but even before, the occurrence of an MI.\r"

  ".U": "89003513\r", 
  ".W": "Mitral pressure half-time (T1/2) is widely used as an independent measure of mitral valve area in patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valvotomy. However, fluid dynamics theory predicts T1/2 to be strongly dependent on chamber compliance and the peak transmitral gradient, which are variables that change dramatically with valvotomy. These theoretical predictions were tested in an in vitro model of the left heart where valve area, chamber compliance, and initial gradient were independently adjusted. Measured T1/2 was observed to vary inversely with orifice area and directly with net chamber compliance and the square root of the initial pressure gradient. Theoretical predictions of T1/2 agreed with observed values with r = 0.998. To test this theory in vivo, the hemodynamic tracings of 18 patients undergoing mitral valvotomy were reviewed. Predictions were made for T1/2 assuming dependence only on valve area; these showed some correlations before valvotomy (r = 0.48-0.64, p less than 0.05) but none after valvotomy (r = 0.05-0.28, p = NS). Predictions for T1/2 based on the theoretical derivation (and thus including compliance and pressure in their calculation) were much better: before valvotomy, r = 0.93-0.96, p less than 0.0001; after valvotomy, r = 0.52-0.66, p less than 0.05. These data indicate that T1/2 is not an independent inverse measure of mitral valve area but is also directly proportional to net chamber compliance and the square root of the initial transmitral gradient. These other factors render T1/2 an unreliable measure of mitral valve area in the setting of acute mitral valvotomy.\r"

  ".U": "89003514\r", 
  ".W": "Postsystolic shortening and thickening of ischemic and postischemic myocardium are well-recognized phenomena, but their significance is controversial. To discover whether postsystolic shortening and thickening might represent an active process and to establish their place as possible predictors of functional recovery during and after recovery from ischemia, we examined correlations in severely ischemic dyskinetic myocardial segments in 14 open-chest anesthetized dogs (90 minutes' ischemia, n = 9; 180 minutes' ischemia, n = 5) between the magnitudes of postsystolic shortening and thickening during ischemia and either the magnitudes of systolic shortening and thickening in the same segments before coronary occlusion or the magnitudes of shortening and thickening at 30-60 minutes and at 2-3 weeks after reperfusion. We found positive correlations between preocclusion shortening and postsystolic shortening (r = 0.44, n = 33 myocardial segments; p less than 0.02) and between preocclusion thickening and postsystolic thickening (r = 0.73, n = 13 segments; p less than 0.01), both measured at 5 minutes after onset of ischemia. Strong correlations were found also between postsystolic shortening and thickening measured immediately before reperfusion and systolic shortening and thickening measured after recovery at 2-3 weeks (r = 0.73, n = 28; p less than 0.001 for shortening; r = 0.79, n = 12; p less than 0.01 for thickening). Significant but less-exact correlations were found between postsystolic shortening and thickening measured immediately before reperfusion and early recovery of shortening and thickening at 30-60 minutes after reperfusion (during the \"stunned myocardium\" period). Postsystolic shortening and thickening persisted early after reperfusion in dogs that had had 90 minutes of ischemia, and this predicted further significant return of function at 2-3 weeks. However, dogs that had had 180 minutes of ischemia did not have postsystolic shortening or thickening during early recovery and showed no further return of function at 2-3 weeks. The magnitudes of postsystolic shortening and thickening immediately before reperfusion were better predictors of late return of function than the histological appearance of the ischemic segments at 2-3 weeks or the magnitude of their blood flow during ischemia (15 +/- 3 micron microspheres). From correlations made immediately before reperfusion with those at functional recovery after reperfusion, we conclude that postsystolic shortening and thickening of dyskinetic myocardial segments are markers of their potential for recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mean 12-hour serum GH concentration was significantly lower in patients with TGHD (p less than 0.001), children with PGHD (p less than 0.01), and subjects with ISS (p less than 0.01) than in subjects with FSS and CGD. No overlap was observed between the range of mean concentration values of children with TGHD and that of subjects with FSS. A significant correlation was found between growth velocity expressed as SD from the mean for bone age and GH concentration (p less than 0.001). All patients with a growth velocity less than 3rd percentile for bone age showed a mean nocturnal concentration less than 4 ng/ml.

A maximal dosage of 3 ml of TAC (containing 175 mg cocaine and 7.5 mg tetracaine) was applied to each laceration. The diluted TAC preparation provided complete anesthesia for approximately 95% of the more than 400 sutures placed. No adverse reactions were noted in any patient who received TAC, and in no instance did a complication of wound healing occur. The original formulation of TAC was arbitrarily composed, and the maximum concentration per dosage of the potentially toxic component medications of TAC that can be \"safely\" applied to dermal lacerations in children remains to be defined. Utilization of this diluted preparation will diminish the risk of potential systemic toxicity from the absorbed component medications of TAC without compromising anesthetic efficacy.\r"

At the time of blood sampling, pain intensity, mood, and cognitive performance were assessed. There was large individual variation in the dose-drug level relationship. Seven patients with bone or soft tissue pain and drug levels of greater than or equal to 4 ng/ml had good pain control, whereas 10 did not. None of 15 patients with levels less than 4 ng/ml had pain control, despite drug doses similar to those given patients with higher levels. Thus 60% of the patients without control of their pain had hydromorphone levels below the lowest level that produced pain control. No patient with pain from nerve infiltration or compression had good pain control, irrespective of the drug level or dose. Poor mood correlated with high pain intensity and low drug level. Impaired cognitive performance was not related to drug level. Knowing that there is a low concentration of narcotic in the blood of a patient with chronic severe pain who is receiving high drug doses and who shows lack of both efficacy and side effects may reassure health care professionals that further narcotic dosage escalation is appropriate.\r"

Morphine data for periods 1 and 2 were designated as group A, and morphine data for periods 3 and 4 were designated as group B. Residual analgesic effects were 0.12 for both SPID and TOTPAR in group A and were 0.65 and 0.17 for SPID and TOTPAR, respectively, in group B. In these 55 studies, there was no evidence of significant residual analgesic effects. Thus the crossover design is an appropriate method for the evaluation of selected parenteral analgesics in the postoperative pain model.\r"

The highest drop was in the splenic vein after the H1-antagonist and in the gastric vein after the H2-antagonist. The histamine level was somewhat higher in the splenic compartment. These results suggest that both H1- and H2-receptors are present in the four portal compartments, but their distribution may not be uniform.\r"

Diets consisting of 109 and 259 mEq Na were given for 5 days each before the study drug was given. On days 4 and 9, intravenous verapamil (0.075 mg/kg) and oral verapamil (80 mg) were given, followed by 80 mg at 8-hour intervals for three doses. On days 1, 4, 5, 9, and 10, serum and urine electrolytes, osmolality (urine [Uosm], serum [Sosm], and osmolar clearance [Cosm]), calcium plasma renin activity (PRA), and levels of serum aldosterone, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, atrial natriuretic hormone (atriopeptin), and erythrocyte calcium and electrolytes were measured. On days 5 and 10, serial plasma samples for measurement of verapamil and norverapamil levels were drawn immediately after the last oral dose of verapamil. After verapamil, Uosm and Cosm decreased during both 109 and 259 mEq sodium diets (Uosm, p less than 0.025; Cosm, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.025, respectively), but free water clearance increased during each diet (p less than 0.01). Urine volume and sodium excretion increased with the 259 mEq sodium diet (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.01, respectively). There were no significant changes in measured values of components of calcium metabolism with either diet or after verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In healthy subjects, caffeine and debrisoquin metabolism and the oxidation and acetylation phenotypes were stable. In the patients with diabetes, the two tests showed a significant decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin level and a significant increase in the 24-hour elimination rate of all caffeine metabolites. Most of the values were lower compared with those of healthy subjects during the first test. Because of these variations, caffeine cannot be used to determine the rapid or slow acetylator status in patients with diabetes. In contrast, neither the oxidation of debrisoquin nor the phenotypic expression was disturbed. These results reiterate the need for defining the administration conditions and surveying the drugs used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus complications.\r"

The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of S-9780 (1 mg administered intravenously) and perindopril (8 mg administered orally) was examined in a double-blind, crossover, acute study in eight young (29 +/- 3 years) and eight elderly (71 +/- 3 years) healthy subjects. Mild headache and light-headedness were the only adverse effects and were more common in the younger subjects. Blood pressure fall was greater in the elderly even after correction for starting blood pressure. Bioavailability of S-9780 was increased in the elderly (35% +/- 17% compared with 19% +/- 7%; p less than 0.025) mainly because of increased conversion rather than absorption. Renal clearance of S-9780 was lower in the elderly (67 +/- 31 ml/min compared with 110 +/- 39 ml/min; p less than 0.03). Dose reduction of approximately 50% is suggested for elderly patients with further adjustment proportional to any preexisting diminished renal function.\r"

Forty-one subjects (5.4%) had an MR greater than 12.6 and were classified as slow debrisoquin hydroxylators. The MR was reproducible in urine stored at +8 degrees C for 1 week and at -20 degrees C over a period of 5 years. Collection intervals of 6 or 12 hours gave the same MR. Intraindividual repeatability of the debrisoquin phenotyping test was established in 37 subjects examined twice at least 2 weeks apart. The calculated frequency of the single allele that is believed to control deficient debrisoquin hydroxylation is similar among white Swedish people, as among other white groups examined so far; however, it is significantly different from the frequency in certain Oriental groups. Detailed comparisons of the prevalence of slow debrisoquin hydroxylation in different ethnic groups are not possible due to shortcomings in current epidemiologic techniques used (small materials, the location of the antimode distinguishing rapid and slow hydroxylators unknown, and family studies missing).\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of furosemide and its diuretic effect were studied in six patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and in six age-matched healthy volunteers. Furosemide was given intravenously at a dose of approximately 0.5 mg/kg. Renal excretion of furosemide was decreased in CF because nonrenal clearance was more than twice as high as in controls (p = 0.03). Nonrenal clearance correlated with the volume of distribution (r2 = 0.52, p = 0.01), which makes a difference in the distribution and binding determinants for clearance. Another reason for increased nonrenal clearance could be induction of drug metabolism in CF, but the excretion of furosemide conjugate did not differ significantly between the groups. Although 26% less furosemide was excreted in CF than in controls (p = 0.03), the diuretic response (calculated as excretion of water and electrolytes) did not differ. Thus the diuretic efficiency was higher in CF for Na+ (p = 0.02), Cl- (p = 0.01), K+ (p = 0.07), and volume (p = 0.005). This difference is probably secondary to the different rates of delivery of furosemide into urine.\r"

Administration of NSAIDs increased the AUC and decreased the oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution of the H2-receptor antagonists without modifying their t1/2. Urinary data and observed modifications in ranitidine and cimetidine metabolites seem to justify a greater increase of H2-receptor antagonist bioavailability with indomethacin (p less than 0.05) than with sulindac (NS). The administration of ranitidine significantly reduced the sulindac volume of distribution without modifying its clearance, which caused an increase in the maximum concentration and a decrease in the t1/2 (p less than 0.05). The effects of cimetidine on the two NSAIDs were more intense than the effect of ranitidine: the decrease in sulindac volume of distribution (p less than 0.02) was accompanied by a significant reduction in sulindac clearance (p less than 0.05). AUC and urinary amounts of sulindac's sulfone metabolite were decreased. These results show that NSAIDs increased the bioavailability of H2-receptor antagonists, and that the latter drugs decrease the volume of distribution of NSAIDs. Furthermore, cimetidine modifies the oxidation metabolism of sulindac.\r"

Hepatic clearance and its two biologic determinants, hepatic blood flow and metabolic activity (intrinsic clearance [maximum velocity/metabolite elimination rate constant, or Vmax/km]), were determined from hepatic indocyanine green elimination at steady state in patients with cirrhosis. Acute intravenous administration 10 mg verapamil significantly increased the hepatic indocyanine green blood flow (p less than 0.05), but significantly decreased the hepatic clearance (p less than 0.05), extraction ratio (p less than 0.05) and Vmax/km (p less than 0.05). However, acute sublingual administration of 10 mg nifedipine resulted in no significant change in any parameters of hepatic elimination function. These results show that verapamil, but not nifedipine, might impair the transhepatic extraction activity of hepatocytes in patients with HBsAg-positive cirrhosis and ascites.\r"

Our results suggest that (1) teicoplanin and netilmicin given once daily induced only slight, reversible tubular damage, without any sign of ototoxicity; (2) their combination was not more toxic; and (3) clinical studies can be envisaged to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of once-daily regimens in long-term treatment.\r"

Eight healthy men received oral sustained-release procainamide, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 days, alone and with oral trimethoprim, 200 mg daily for 4 days. Concomitant trimethoprim significantly increased the plasma AUC(0-12) of both procainamide and NAPA (63% and 52%, respectively), with concurrent decreases in their renal clearances (47% and 13%, respectively) and a 39% increase in the mean urinary recovery of NAPA (as percentage of procainamide and NAPA recovery). After trimethoprim coadministration, there was also a trend toward a decrease in the apparent acetylation clearance of procainamide (19%, p = 0.057). The change in procainamide and NAPA renal clearances after trimethoprim coadministration strongly correlated with their baseline renal clearances (r = 0.84 and r = 0.74, respectively, p less than 0.0001). There was small but significant increase in the corrected QT interval with procainamide administration, which increased further with trimethoprim coadministration. We conclude that trimethoprim increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and NAPA by decreasing their renal clearances and allowing more conversion of procainamide to NAPA.\r"

There were small increases in heart rate (72 +/- 6.3 to 82 +/- 5.1 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and mean arterial pressure (88 +/- 8.2 to 93 +/- 10 mm Hg, p = NS), while the plasma nicotine level increased to a maximum of 16 +/- 2.0 ng/ml (p less than 0.001). No changes were seen in either osmolality (283 +/- 3.4 mOsm/kg) or AVP level (4.3 +/- 2.0 pg/ml) in eight of the nine subjects who remained asymptomatic. In one subject whose hemodynamic and plasma nicotine responses were similar to the others but who became nauseated, the plasma AVP level increased from 4.2 to 26 pg/ml. These data suggest that nicotine at the plasma concentrations achieved in this study is not associated with stimulation of plasma AVP secretion in normal man. Other factors in association with nicotine use, in this case nausea, may be required for AVP stimulation to occur.\r"

The renal tubule cells and the accompaniments including myeloid bodies, inflammatory cells, or fibrin permit, in a particular clinical setting, synthesis of a meaningful renal diagnosis. Sequential TEM sediment studies can clarify ambiguities in diagnosis. Precisely, when much difficulty is experienced in distinguishing ATN from aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity in a patient with sepsis who has received aminoglycoside, urinary sediment TEM can facilitate the differential diagnosis with confidence. In another clinical setting, such as hypersensitivity acute interstitial nephritis, TEM urinary sediment has an irrevocable place by exhibiting the characteristic eosinophil granules that will confirm the above diagnosis, or deny it when they are absent. The morphologic features in the renal tubule cells in the sediment reflect similar changes in the tubular cells in renal tissue. Therefore, the severity of tubular changes are commensurate with the clinical outcome in terms of renal function recovery, need of dialysis, and mortality. The degree of correlation is significant. Thus, slight or no TEM sediment tubular changes signifies a good prospect for renal function recovery and low or no mortality. Conversely, severe tubular changes in the TEM sediment denote persistent renal failure accompanied by high mortality. Furthermore, the most severe tubular changes, found in hepatorenal syndrome, are consistent with its dismal prognosis.\r"

The history may indicate admission for AMI exclusion or unstable angina, although these data remain largely subjective. The physical examination provides few clues in subtle presentations of myocardial cell death, and instead identifies patients with left ventricular dysfunction, often with failure. The 12-lead ECG is an insensitive early indicator of AMI, often identifying 50% or fewer of these patients. Currently, thrombolytic therapy or invasive catheterization techniques such as PTCA are based on 12-lead depictions of acute injury patterns. Finally, serum markers of AMI, particularly myoglobin, CPK-MM isoforms, and new monoclonal antibody assays for CPK-MB may allow early identification of patients with AMI with nondiagnostic ECGs.\r"

The study group received oral nonabsorbable antimicrobial agents (i.e., tobramycin, amphotericin B, and polymyxin E) in addition to parenteral antibiotics. Colonization with Gram-negative microorganisms in the oropharynx, and respiratory and digestive tracts increased in the control group during their stay, while the study group did not tend to colonize with Gram-negative bacteria. In the control group, 107 nosocomial infections were diagnosed, vs. 42 nosocomial infections in the study group. Nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria were significantly less frequent in the study group. Mortality due to an acquired infection was significantly less frequent in the study group. We conclude that colonization, infection, and subsequent mortality by nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria can be prevented by a regime of topically applied nonabsorbable antibiotics.\r"

The children ranged in age from 10 months to 8 yr and their height and weight ranged from the third to the 97th percentile. Each child had a thermodilution catheter in place to monitor cardiac output. The bioimpedance monitor used in this study, the NCCOM-3, required the input of a constant (L), which was obtained for each individual patient by adjusting the L setting until cardiac output measured by bioimpedance (COBI) was within 10% of cardiac output measured by thermodilution (COTD). This method of determining L was superior to using either measured thoracic length or the manufacturer's guidelines to obtain L and resulted in an excellent correlation between COTD and COBI (r = .94; p less than .05; n = 59). In children less than 125 cm in height, measured thoracic length alone was inadequate to use for L but provided a good approximation of L when multiplied by 1.25. This study suggests that the use of transthoracic bioimpedance to determine cardiac output compares favorably with thermodilution techniques and it is noninvasive.\r"

Four well-recognized risk factors for ARI were present alone or in combination in all episodes: hypotension, sepsis, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and radiocontrast dye. Hypotension was the most prevalent factor, present in 42 (85.8%) episodes, and was the sole factor present in 18 (36.7%). Patients with ARI but without hypotension all survived their ICU stay, while only 13 (33%) of 40 with hypotension survived (p less than .05). Neither initial, peak nor change in BUN or creatinine predicted mortality; oliguria was marginally associated with poor prognosis. Our findings indicate that: a) ARI was a frequent and important contributing factor to mortality in our critically ill patients, b) hypotension was the most common of well-recognized risk factors, and c) conditions that predisposed to ARI also predisposed to mortality, although mortality did not appear to depend on the severity of renal insufficiency.\r"

We measured the cumulative tissue oxygen debt during and immediately after 100 consecutive high-risk surgical operations in 98 patients and correlated these data with the subsequent development of lethal and nonlethal organ failure complications. The tissue VO2 deficit was calculated as the measured VO2 minus the estimated VO2 requirements corrected for both temperature and anesthesia; the net cumulative VO2 deficit was calculated as the integrated area under the VO2 deficit-time curve. The maximum cumulative VO2 deficit averaged 33.5 +/- 36.9 (SD) L/m2 in nonsurvivors, 26.8 +/- 32.1 L/m2 in survivors with organ failure, and 8.0 +/- 10.9 L/m2 in survivors without organ failure. The time postoperatively to reach the maximal cumulative VO2 deficit and the duration of the VO2 deficit was greatest in nonsurvivors, less in survivors with organ failure, and least in survivors without organ failure. Although many associated clinical conditions as well as innumerable physiologic mechanisms and biochemical mediators play important roles in tissue injury, tissue oxygen debt reflected by insufficient VO2 appears to be the primary event as well as a major determinant of organ failure and outcome.\r"

  ".U": "89004162\r", 
  ".W": "The role of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte in the development of acute lung injury has been the subject of much controversy. Experimental lung injury is associated with peripheral leukopenia and the intrapulmonary sequestration of leukocytes. We have previously shown that ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can improve the hemodynamic alterations of canine endotoxin shock. Ibuprofen has also been found to decrease leukocyte adherence. We investigated the dose response of ibuprofen on the increased neutrophil adherence and the extent of lung injury associated with canine endotoxin shock. Single doses of ibuprofen (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg iv) were administered 15 min after Escherichia coli endotoxin. Endotoxemia resulted in leukopenia and an increased neutrophil adherence in both aortic and pulmonary artery blood. Endotoxin-treated animals exhibited increased neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a marker of lung injury. The 20-mg/kg ibuprofen dose decreased aortic granulocyte adherence at 30 min, while all ibuprofen doses decreased the aortic adherence at 120 min. The increased pulmonary artery neutrophil adherence was not affected by ibuprofen. Histologically, lung injury was manifested by intravascular leukostasis. Ibuprofen treatment did not affect the histologic or morphometric extent of the lung injury. The leukopenia and increased neutrophil adherence occur rapidly after endotoxemia and are associated with subsequent intravascular sequestration of leukocytes. Agents designed to prevent lung injury must either be given before the insult or be able to block the effects of the toxic products released by the activated granulocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial plasma catecholamines were measured in 16 sheep, before and 24 h after surgical induction of peritonitis. Animals were volume loaded with lactated Ringer's solution (8 L/24 h) before and after surgery; non became hypotensive. For analysis, animals were retrospectively divided into those with increased serum creatinine after 24 h of sepsis (group 1, n = 8) and those without (group 2, n = 8). Group 1 showed increased cardiac index and decreased systemic vascular resistance typical of severe sepsis, with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), oliguria, sodium retention, increased plasma renin activity (PRA), decreased urinary kallikrein excretion, and increased urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha excretion. Group 2 showed insignificant hemodynamic disturbance, and no significant renal response. Plasma catecholamines were equal in both groups at baseline. In group 1, there were uniform increases after 24 h in plasma norepinephrine (474 +/- 115 to 1183 +/- 158 [SEM] pg/ml; p less than .01) and plasma epinephrine (108 +/- 8 to 309 +/- 70 pg/ml; p less than .05). In group 2, neither plasma norepinephrine (343 +/- 59 to 330 +/- 56 pg/ml) nor plasma epinephrine (116 +/- 16 to 116 +/- 13 pg/ml) changed significantly. Plasma norepinephrine correlated inversely with GFR; plasma epinephrine correlated with PRA. The sympathetic nervous system may be involved in the renal response to nonhypotensive sepsis, both directly and via effects on other vasoactive hormone systems.\r"

High pressure gas delivered via a jet in the breathing limb of a T-piece, in which there are no valves, drives respiratory fresh gas (RFG), supplied to the tracheal tube from any low pressure source, into the lungs. Observations on anesthetized rabbits showed that after setting up for a PaCO2 of 36 torr at 30 cycle/min, it remained around 36 torr when the ventilation frequency was progressively increased to 200 cycle/min. The mean peak proximal airway and tracheal pressures were 13 and 12, 11 and 7, and 13 cm H2O (PEEP 2.1 cm H2O) and 7.4 cm H2O (PEEP 3.1 cm H2O) at 30, 100 and 200 cycle/min, respectively. In this open valveless breathing system, desynchronized spontaneous and artificial ventilation occurred quietly without any marked variation in the airway pressures. This preliminary study on a new pneumatic system shows its potential for simplifying and improving infant ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "We tested a number of pulse oximeters in a neonatal ICU to assess their performance as continuous monitors. Using a computer-based data acquisition system and a movement sensor, we determined the proportion of time that the oximeter was unreliable as the duration of monitored time that the oximeter heart rate (HR) differed from a \"true\" HR by greater than 10 beat/min using each of the oximeters in both their short and long averaging mode. The tested devices were found to be unreliable for 11.9% to 25% in the short averaging mode, and from 13.8% to 29% in the longer averaging mode. Most of the HR discrepancy was secondary to movement of the extremity. A newer model of one of the devices, which uses ECG R-wave detection to trigger optical pulse scanning, was associated with markedly reduced motion artifact (2.1% to 4.1%) when it accurately interpreted HR. The response of the devices to an acute loss of pulsation revealed differences in design and performance with some oximeters indicating zero saturation and others continuing to display a value while indicating a \"low quality signal.\" Pulse oximeters are a valuable adjunct to clinical oxygen monitoring and, when properly applied and reliably indicating the infant's HR, will accurately reflect arterial saturation (r = .8, p less than .0001). ECG synchronization appears to reduce motion artifact when the ECG R-wave is detected.\r"

Transducers are often referenced to the midaxillary line of the supine patient. We utilized CT of the chest to determine accurately the topographic location of the left atrium to evaluate the accuracy of referencing the transducer in this position and to investigate atrial location in the lateral decubitus positions vis-a-vis external landmarks, so that more accurate referencing could be performed with a pulmonary artery catheter tip in the dependent lung. A prospective group consisting of ten patients referred for chest CT as well as retrospective review of 40 chest CT scans served as the study population. This study demonstrated a discrepancy between the perceived midaxillary line and the true location of the midleft atrium. Lateral decubitus CT scanning revealed a more readily localizable surface anatomic landmark which consistently and accurately predicts midleft atrial location. In addition, the appropriate decubitus position guarantees dependent catheter tip placement (Zone 3).\r"

One patient was treated with ECMO twice. Four perfusions were veno-arterial, the remainder veno-venous. Perfusions ranged from 1 1/2 to 19 days, with a mean of six days. Ten patients died during treatment or soon after it was discontinued. Eight patients improved enough to allow resumption of standard ventilation, and four patients recovered sufficiently to have normal arterial blood gas levels on room air. Three are long-term survivors. Multiple surgical procedures have been performed successfully during use of ECMO including lung lavage, open lung biopsy and three lung transplants. Major complications include hemorrhagic diatheses and sepsis. The technique involves a substantial commitment of time and personnel but remains a tenable option for presumed reversible life-threatening respiratory failure.\r"

To discover whether children of smokers are affected more severely during the cold, wet season, when windows are closed and children are indoors, than during the warm, dry season, when houses are well ventilated and children spend more time outdoors, we compared lung function tests recorded during the two seasons. If seen during the cold, wet season, children of smoking mothers compared with those of nonsmoking mothers had a lower FEV1% (74 vs 86, p = .00), FEF25-75 percent (56 vs 75, p = .00) and PC20 histamine (0.85 vs 1.95, p = .01). There was a highly significant correlation between the number of cigarettes the mother smoked in the house and each of these lung function test results, indicating a dose-response relationship. Those seen during the warm, dry season, by contrast, did not have lower mean spirometric test results if their mothers were smokers than if nonsmokers, and there was no correlation between the number of cigarettes the mother smoked in the house and the result of any lung function test. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that cigarette smoke from the mother aggravates her child's asthma.\r"

Twelve patients with asthma performed EVH for two or four min at 60 percent maximal voluntary ventilation, 30 min, 2 and 4 h after treatment. All treatments (Rx) produced significant bronchodilation after 30 min. The Rx containing a beta-adrenoceptor agonist maintained this bronchodilation for at least 2 h. While all the Rx with a beta-adrenoceptor agonist significantly reduced the fall in forced expiratory volume in one second after EVH at 30 min, only the combination of fenoterol and ipratropium provided significant protection after 2 h. We advise that the duration of protective effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists is short and patients with moderate to severe exercise-induced asthma may be better controlled by combination therapy.\r"

Group A received methylprednisolone, 80 mg/24 h, and aminophylline by continuous infusion. Group B received a comparable dose of a sustained-release theophylline and methylprednisolone, 80 mg in two equally divided doses, by mouth. Assessment of response was based on daily spirometric tests and evaluation of dyspnea and wheezing. Arterial blood gas and serum theophylline levels were also measured. The groups were comparable with respect to age, sex distribution, smoking history, and spirometric evidence of obstruction. Initial spirometric test results showed moderate obstruction, equal in the two groups. Obstruction improved markedly by both spirometric and clinical criteria in the four-day study period. The improvement in FEV1 and dyspnea index was slightly greater for group B, but the differences were not significant. We conclude that oral administration of steroids and theophylline is as effective as intravenous use in treating hospitalized patients with moderate exacerbations of airways obstruction.\r"

We studied the effects of coronary recanalization on the development of arrhythmias in patients receiving thrombolytic agents during the early hours of acute myocardial infarction. Acute cardiac catheterization, assessing perfusion of the infarction-related artery and identifying the arrhythmias, was performed within eight hours of onset of symptoms. Fifty-six of 67 patients (84 percent) studied had total occlusion of the infarction-related artery, 25 of whom had restoration of coronary flow during the 90 minutes after initiation of therapy; 31 had no evidence of reperfusion. Eleven patients had subtotal vessel occlusion that did not change appreciably during therapy, and 20 patients (30 percent) had transient arrhythmias. There were no significant differences in the frequency of arrhythmias: 36 percent of reperfused patients, 19 percent of nonreperfused, and 45 percent of subtotal occlusion patients. Only bradyarrhythmia was significantly related to the restoration of flow of the right coronary artery. Other rhythm disturbances, including accelerated idioventricular rhythm, did not correlate with a change in the perfusion status of the vessel. Bradycardia may be a useful marker for right coronary artery reperfusion. Arrhythmias in general are not specific for coronary reperfusion and should not be used as event markers.\r"

Progression from a normal or minimally narrowed lumen diameter to narrowing greater than or equal to 75 percent (to greater than or equal to 90 percent) in 21 patients) occurred in at least one vessel in 33 patients (69 percent) (group A, type I progression). Less striking progression and progression of initially more severe lesions was seen in 15 of 29 patients without type 1 progression (Group B) and in other vessels in 12 group A patients. Improvement in at least one vessel was seen in eight patients. There was no difference between groups A and B in the incidence of risk factors, intervening myocardial infarction, or recent unstable angina. It is concluded that progression of occlusive coronary disease occurs as commonly in areas of the coronary tree that are minimally diseased as in segments that are initially severely narrowed. Methods to stabilize the endothelium may prevent progression of coronary artery disease.\r"

The studies were retrospective and prospective in design, conducted in referral-based cardiology clinics at a national cardiovascular center. A selected sample of 142 patients underwent exercise ECG and coronary angiography, as did a normal control group of 402 patients who were apparently free from CAD. Sixty three other patients who underwent coronary angiography were also studied prospectively. No limitations of medical treatment were exacted for the test except digitalis treatment. Linear regression analysis, from which ST/HR slope was derived, was done with seven measurements of HR and ST displacement at 60 ms from J point in leads a VF and V5 during 6 min before the end of exercise. MSHS was derived from a multiple regression model with peak HR (% maximum HR), ST index (ST depression + ST slope), and ST/HR slope. Although the usual ST criteria (sensitivity = 63 percent, specificity = 73 percent), ST index (71 percent, 80 percent), and ST/HR slope (70 percent, 97 percent) were equally accurate in detection of CAD, MSHS showed significantly improved sensitivity (88 percent) with similar specificity (81 percent). In identification of three-vessel or left main CAD, when compared with other criteria, ST/HR slope and MSHS provided improved diagnostic accuracy: sensitivity (74 and 78 percent, respectively), specificity (88 and 93 percent) and overall test accuracy (85 and 89 percent). The improved accuracy of ST/HR slope and MSHS was prospectively validated in 63 other patients. ST/HR slope was applicable to computerized ECG data for the standard treadmill test, and showed improved accuracy in detection of three-vessel or left main CAD. The new, modified ST/HR score more accurately predicted not only the presence but also the severity of CAD.\r"

All patients had neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at the time of BAL, were receiving broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, and 15 were also receiving amphotericin B before BAL. The median interval between the detection of pulmonary infiltrates and BAL was seven days (range, 0 to 23 days); the median interval between BAL and autopsy was nine days (range, 1 to 20 days). The diagnostic yield of BAL was 15 percent (3 of 20 specific diseases); all three were Candida pneumonia. The sensitivity of BAL was 75 percent and its specificity 100 percent, for Candida pneumonia. BAL did not result in a specific diagnosis for the 17 remaining diseases, nine of which were Aspergillus pneumonia. In seven patients in whom autopsy was performed within 72 hours of BAL, lavage results correlated with those of autopsy in only one who had Candida pneumonia. All BAL cultures were falsely positive, except in four cases of Candida pneumonia. The therapeutic regimen was not modified according to the BAL results in any of the 22 patients. There were no major complications associated with the procedure.\r"

The PC-IRV resulted in a reduction of minute ventilation from 22 +/- 1.0 L/min (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 0.7 L/min. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was reduced from 66 +/- 2.3 cm H2O to 46 +/- 1.6 cm H2O and positive end expiratory pressures (PEEP) from 15 +/- 1.0 cm H2O to 2.5 +/- 0.5 cm H2O. Mean airway pressure increased from 30 +/- 1.7 cm H2O to 35 +/- 1.7 cm H2O. Oxygenation (PaO2) improved from 69 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 80 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. The PaCO2 and arterial pH were not significantly changed. There were no significant changes in mean hemodynamic pressures. A lung compromise index (FIO2.PIP.10/PaO2) retrospectively distinguished between successful and unsuccessful PC-IRV episodes. These data suggest that PC-IRV can be successfully and safely implemented in critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure over prolonged periods of time resulting in significant improvement in oxygenation at lower minute volume, peak airway pressure and PEEP requirements.\r"

We administered the usual clinical doses of three commonly used bronchodilators to each of six subjects receiving assisted mechanical ventilation in line with the ventilator: two beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonists, metaproterenol, 5 percent solution, and isoetharine, 1 percent solution; and the anticholinergic agent atropine as a control. Each bronchodilator was nebulized over 10 to 15 minutes in random order, four hours apart, and given to every subject. Plasma potassium was measured at five-minute intervals and arterial blood gases at 15-minute intervals, for a total of 50 minutes after administration of each bronchodilator. Following administration of each drug, plasma potassium showed an average decline. The mean decline in plasma potassium from baseline was statistically significant for metaproterenol (p = 0.04) and atropine (p = 0.001) but not for isoetharine (p = 0.09). Although there were no statistically significant differences among the declines in plasma potassium induced by the three drugs, metaproterenol caused the greatest decline (-0.6 mEq/L).\r"

Three of the 13 patients had underlying chronic airflow obstruction (CAO) due to diffuse obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite dyspnea, cough, wheezing, stridor and/or hemoptysis, the diagnosis was delayed because of a normal chest roentgenogram in eight patients and nondiagnostic pulmonary function studies (including maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume loops) in all three patients with CAO and in four of ten patients without CAO. The location of the tumor was extrathoracic in two patients, including one with CAO; intrathoracic in seven patients, including two with CAO; and combined extra- and intrathoracic in four. Tracheal diameter increased from 3.5 +/- 1.0 mm before, and to 9.8 +/- 2.0 mm after single or multiple laser treatments. Increased patency of the trachea after laser surgery was associated with improvement in expiratory and/or inspiratory flow rates and with symptomatic relief in all patients which persisted for 14.1 +/- 8.7 months (range four to 48 months). These results indicate that severe symptomatic narrowing of the extra- and/or intrathoracic trachea to a diameter of 2 to 5 mm may not be detected by conventional chest radiography or even by sensitive physiologic tests, especially in patients with underlying CAO. The resultant delay in diagnosis defers possible relief of disabling symptoms with palliative therapy, including Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation.\r"

In each patient, a single representative CT image was compared with corresponding pathologic specimens of tissue. There was good correlation between the extent of emphysema as assessed by the density mask and the pathologic grade of emphysema. The optimal attenuation level to define areas of emphysema may vary in different scanners, but, once determined for a particular scanner, the density mask accurately assesses the extent of emphysema and eliminates interobserver and intraobserver variability. It has the added advantage of determining the exact percentage of lung parenchyma showing changes consistent with emphysema.\r"

Ten patients had juxtacardiac masses simulating pericardial tumor implants on echocardiographic examination (\"pericardial pseudotumor\") caused by juxtacardiac pulmonary atelectasis or lobar collapse. The atelectatic nature of these masses was based on echocardiographic delineation of pericardial and pleural anatomy, combined with ancillary radiographic and CT studies. Drainage of pleural fluid also led to disappearance of the masses on echocardiographic examination, suggesting that the masses were an ultrasonic manifestation of pulmonary atelectasis resulting from surrounding compressive effusive fluid. Finally, clinical follow-up failed to show development of malignant disease in any patient. The possibility of pericardial pseudotumor should be considered when ultrasound studies show juxtacardiac masses within large collections of pleural fluid, especially in the clinical absence of malignant disease.\r"

Immediately following surgery all patients suffered from frequent bowel actions and soiling. These symptoms improved with time and most patients could enjoy almost normal daily life by the sixth postoperative month. One month after surgery, anal canal resting pressure and maximum squeeze pressure were significantly reduced and rectoanal inhibitory reflex was absent; neither showed a distinct tendency to improve thereafter. Rectal sensation and reservoir capacity, which also were seriously impaired, recovered satisfactorily by the time of the six-month examination. This suggests that an improvement of clinical symptoms following this operation is dependent upon the recovery of reservoir capacity and sensation of the neorectum, and that this operative procedure is a functionally acceptable option for low rectal cancer.\r"

Significantly decreased risks were associated with frequent consumption of raw fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain bread, and significantly increased risks were associated with frequent consumption of white bread, sauces thickened with roux, and bacon or sausages. Risk ratios for consumption of coffee, tea, and alcohol were not significantly different. No statistical associations were found with particular occupational exposures. However, a history of previous anal surgery was reported significantly more often for cases than for controls.

To evaluate the results of resection of pulmonary metastases from patients with colorectal primaries, a retrospective study of all patients who underwent such resection was carried out at the teaching hospitals of McGill University and Universite de Montreal. A total of 345 patients admitted with pulmonary metastases; 27 of them underwent pulmonary resection with the extent of the resection varying from wedge excision of the metastatic nodule to pneumonectomy. In 25 of the 27 patients the resection was considered curative. Eight of the 27 patients had resection of two metastatic lesions while the remaining 19 patients had resection of solitary lesions. The interval between resection of the primary colorectal malignancy and the resection of the metastatic lesion (disease-free interval) varied from 2 to 77 months with a median interval of 35 months. The five-year survival following resection of pulmonary metastases was 21 percent. A prolonged interval between treatment of the primary and resection of the pulmonary metastasis was associated with a longer survival. This retrospective study demonstrates that prolonged survival can be achieved following resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma.\r"

When examined separately, adenomas maintained their significantly higher frequency (27 vs. 10 percent, P less than .001), while no difference was observed as regards carcinomas (9 vs. 7 percent). The odds ratios for adenomas and carcinomas were calculated to be 3.5 +/- 2.5 and 1.4 +/- 1.4, respectively. From the fifth to eighth decades there was a fourfold increase in premalignant and malignant lesions in the patient group and a twofold increase in controls. With relation to sex, a statistically significant difference was reached in men but not in women in the sample examined.

In this series, 42 complications specifically related to the pouch occurred in 36 patients. Stricture was most common, followed by separation of the ileoanal anastomosis, pelvic sepsis, complex fistula, and a leaking pouch. Through judicious application of remedial operations and either delay in closure of the ileostomy or establishment of proximal loop ileostomy, only seven patients required reestablishment of fecal diversion. The authors urge aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic efforts to save the pouch and maintain satisfactory function in most patients.\r"

The mean patient age was 34 years old (range, 18 to 76 years). The causes were obstetrical injury (74 percent), perineal infection (10 percent), operative trauma (7 percent), and unknown (8 percent). Overall, the repair was successful in 83 percent of patients. Success correlated with the number of previous repairs, i.e., none: 88 percent success; one: 85 percent success; two: 55 percent success. There were 25 concomitant overlapping sphincteroplasty procedures. Only minor complications ensued, with no mortality. This repair is recommended for patients with no or one previous repair because of its lack of mortality, minimal morbidity, ease of concomitant sphincteroplasty, and avoidance of a colostomy. For patients with two or more earlier repairs, a muscle interposition should be considered.\r"

Forty-six patients underwent ileodistal sigmoidostomy while five patients underwent ileoproctostomy and five with concomitant rectal prolapse underwent simultaneous proctopexy. A mortality rate of 3.8 percent and morbidity rate of 60 percent were encountered. The most frequently occurring complication was small-bowel obstruction, which occurred in 36 percent, and necessitated laparotomy in 66 percent. Additional procedures were necessary in five patients because of newly discovered rectal prolapse (two patients), rectocele (one patient), unrelieved constipation (one patient), and incapacitating incontinence (one patient). Follow-up data available in 94 percent (mean, 46 months) disclosed that patients had an average of 2.8 bowel movements per day without the use of laxatives (89 percent) or enemas (80 percent). Overall, 79 percent were satisfied with the final outcome. It is concluded that subtotal colectomy constitutes a viable option in the treatment of chronic constipation. However, the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure dictate the need for careful patient selection on the basis of appropriate physiologic testing.\r"

In some cases colonoscopy had been performed initially and, if unsuccessful, these patients were referred for treatment with epidural anesthesia. Seven patients recovered with conservative treatment alone. One patient refused further treatment and died of her underlying disease. Five of eight patients treated by epidural anesthesia responded. There were no recurrences following successful epidural anesthesia. Five of eight patients treated by colonoscopic decompression responded. No patients required surgical intervention. One patient suffered a subendocardial infarction during colonoscopy. There were no significant complications from epidural anesthesia.

Thirty one percent of propositi had negative family histories, 67 percent of observed cancers were in the rectum, three individuals from three families developed cancer under the age of 20. In another family the only cancer was in a 67-year-old patient. Polyp growth rate varied tremendously among individuals and over time within individuals, rectal polyps did not regress after subtotal colectomy, and three patients developed rectal cancer after subtotal colectomy (18 percent). Fifty percent of propositi had cancer on presentation, while only 18 percent of screened family members had cancer. The only extracolonic tumors seen were gastroduodenal polyps and retroperitoneal desmoids in three families. The mode of inheritance of FPC causes this variation and treatment is best tailored to the individual and his family rather than uniformly applied to all patients with FPC.\r"

The patient series included all patients with ulcerative colitis from a colonic cancer surveillance program in a defined area. There were five patients-one who developed colonic cancer, one with high-grade dysplasia, and three with low-grade dysplasia. None of these showed aneuploidy (abnormal DNA stem lines). There were six patients with aneuploidy in one to six locations in the colorectum. On consecutive examinations, there was a high reproducibility of the abnormal DNA pattern for ploidy levels and location in the bowel. In these patients, there was no obvious relationship with definite dysplasia. It is concluded that flow cytometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis may become a valuable complement to evaluation of dysplasia in cancer surveillance, but assessment of the cancer risk in individual patients with aneuploidy needs further investigation.\r"

These venous findings were compared with histologic subserosal venous invasion that was diagnosed with both hematoxylin and eosin and elastica van Gieson's staining. When angiographic findings were compared with histologic subserosal venous invasion, the results of AG-V2, AG-V1, and AG-V0 showed a positive correlation of 92.3 percent, 46.7 percent, and 16.7 percent, respectively. The angiographic findings were also correlated with the degree of fibrosis around the carcinoma of the colon. The incidence rate of liver metastasis in a group of AG-V2 was 46.2 percent. In AG-V1 it was 26.7 percent and in AG-V0 0 percent. In the course of the postoperative follow-up, liver metastases appeared in two cases of AG-V2 and AG-V1, respectively.

In the colonic mucosa with colitis, IgG- and IgM-containing cells were significantly increased in number (IgG: 540 +/- 94/mm2 in experimental group, vs. 120 +/- 54/mm2 in control, P less than .05, IgM: 55.0 +/- 19.7/mm2 in experimental group, vs. 6.7 +/- 2.4/mm2 in control, P less than .05). There was no significant increase of IgA-containing cells either in number or in proportion to the total mononuclear cells. These changes, induced by carrageenan in rabbits, had resembled those in human ulcerative colitis well. These observations suggested an impairment of the IgA-regulated local immune system and an abnormality in the differentiation process of immunoglobulin-secreting cells.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma lipids, apoprotein A-I and B in serum and in lipoprotein fractions (VLDL + LDL, HDL2, and HDL3) obtained by preparative ultracentrifugation, as well as postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity (H-TGL and LPL) were evaluated in 17 subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis (stage II and III) subdivided into two groups according to the presence or absence of lipoprotein X (Lp-X). A reduction in total lipoprotein lipase activity was observed in both patient groups, compared to controls (P less than 0.01); the hepatic lipoprotein lipase was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) only in the Lp-X-positive group. The lipid (477.8 +/- 154.3 vs 239.6 +/- 51.1; P less than 0.01) and protein (147.4 +/- 37.1 vs 83.3 +/- 19.7; P less than 0.01) masses in the VLDL + LDL fraction of the Lp-X-positive group were increased compared to controls. In the same group, the HDL2 fraction also showed an increase in lipid (186.6 +/- 80.0 vs 77.9 +/- 21.6; P less than 0.01) and protein (133.9 +/- 60.0 vs 67.9 +/- 16.5; P less than 0.01) masses; in addition, the HDL2 percent lipid composition was different in the two patient groups, showing a decrease in esterified cholesterol (20.4 +/- 3.6 vs 25.7 +/- 2.2; P less than 0.01) and an increase in phospholipids (59.2 +/- 2.9 vs 54.8 +/- 2.6; p less than 0.01) in the Lp-X-positive group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The serum-ascites albumin difference is reported to be superior to ascitic total protein, ascitic-to-serum total protein ratio, lactic dehydrogenase, and ascitic-to-serum lactic dehydrogenase ratio in differentiating between ascites from liver disease and malignant ascites, S-A greater than 1.1 reflecting portal hypertension. We analyzed ascitic fluid from 46 consecutive patients with chronic liver disease, 28 patients with ascites associated with malignancy, 10 patients with right-sided heart failure, 4 patients with hypothyroidism, and 6 patients with miscellaneous causes of ascites to determine if this albumin difference is indeed a more valuable parameter. Analysis of our data confirms with a larger number of patients that the serum-ascites albumin difference is a more reliable indicator of transudative ascites, better termed portal hypertensive ascites. Malignant ascites without liver metastases had features of nonportal hypertensive ascites, and the serum-ascites albumin difference confirms this. The characteristics of malignant ascites associated with liver metastases, however, resemble those of the portal hypertensive ascites complicating liver disease. This new parameter is also helpful in distinguishing congestive heart failure with high protein ascites and portal hypertensive ascitic features from malignant ascites without liver metastases. Of particular note, myxedematous ascitic fluid, classically categorized as exudative, had an S-A greater than 1.1, indicating the possible role of portal hypertension in the development of ascites in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "89004434\r", 
  ".W": "Selenium deficiency has been implicated as contributing to hepatic injury in alcoholics. The mechanism by which this occurs is most likely lipoperoxidation secondary to decreased activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase. To further assess this relationship, we measured selenium content in autopsy livers in 12 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared to 13 patients matched for age and sex dying from other causes, mostly with cardiopulmonary diseases. The mean (+/- SEM) hepatic selenium content in cirrhosis was 0.731 +/- 0.077 microgram/g dry weight versus 1.309 +/- 0.166 microgram/g in controls (P less than 0.005; Student's t test). Clinical and biochemical indices of significant hepatic dysfunction, including encephalopathy, ascites, and elevations of serum bilirubin or prothrombin time, were only present in the cirrhotic group. A significant inverse correlation between hepatic selenium content and the prothrombin time was noted (r = -0.50; P less than 0.02). No significant relationships between hepatic selenium and the abnormalities of bilirubin, albumin, or aspartate aminotransferase were found. We conclude that significantly decreased hepatic selenium stores are present in patients with severe alcoholic cirrhosis compared to controls. The magnitude of that selenium deficit does correlate with some indices of hepatic function, specifically the prothrombin time. These data lend further support to a true selenium deficiency state in alcoholic cirrhosis. It is highly possible that selenium deficiency represents an important link, synergistically joining the nutritional and hepatotoxic backgrounds of alcoholic liver injury and cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of gastroduodenal lesions has been investigated in 142 patients with liver cirrhosis of various degrees of severity and in 63 patients with mild liver disease (controls) in whom liver biopsy excluded nodular regeneration. Cirrhotic patients were subdivided in three groups according to the Pugh modification of the Child-Turcotte criteria. Although the frequency of peptic ulcer was not different, gastroduodenal erosions were observed more frequently in cirrhotics than in controls (29.6% vs 11.1%, P less than 0.01). The occurrence of erosions was related to the severity of the disease: in Child A and B patients their frequency was 21 and 26% respectively, but rose to 48.4 (15 of 31 vs 7 of 63 in controls, P less than 0.001) in the Child C group. Both mild and severe gastroduodenitis occurred more frequently, although not significantly, in patients with liver cirrhosis. All together one or more endoscopic lesions were observed in almost 60% of cirrhotics but only in 25.4% of controls (P less than 0.001). In conclusion, our data do not show an increased prevalence of peptic ulcer in cirrhotic patients; in contrast, liver cirrhosis is significantly associated with the endoscopic finding of gastroduodenal erosions, especially in the more advanced stages of the disease. These findings would suggest a cautious use, in cirrhotic patients, of drugs which may damage the gastroduodenal mucosa; moreover, long-term administration of antacids or of other drugs with a protective effect on gastroduodenal mucosa might be taken into consideration for Child C patients.\r"

Of the three patients with cholangitis in whom CA19-9 levels were followed serially, all had rapid return of levels to normal after successful treatment.

  ".W": "The pancreatic Schilling test (PST), a noninvasive, sensitive pancreatic function test, was studied to determine its ability to detect pancreatic proteolytic enzyme replacement in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. Seven subjects with well-documented pancreatic insufficiency and an abnormal PST consistent with pancreatic insufficiency were studied with three enzyme regimens: (1) Viokase (four tablets), (2) Pancrease (three capsules), and (3) Pancrease (10 capsules). The effect of cimetidine on the results of the PST with high-dose Pancrease was also determined in two subjects with pancreatic insufficiency and in two normal volunteers. The results of the investigation demonstrate that the PST is a sensitive noninvasive test for the presence of orally administered proteolytic enzymes in subjects with pancreatic insufficiency and in normals. Furthermore, the studies illustrate that the administration of enzymes in a form of enteric-coated microspheres does not enhance the delivery of proteolytic enzymes to the small intestine when compared to conventional high-dose enzyme replacement. Cimetidine appears to decrease the inactivation of the proteolytic enzymes in enteric-coated microspheres, suggesting that a low pH in the small intestine and stomach are responsible for the poor delivery of the enzymes into the small intestine.\r"

Ingestion of a pH-sensitive enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme preparation was accompanied with a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in steatorrhea, as well as a lower mean concentration and recovery of lipase and trypsin activity in the postprandial duodenal samples. Furthermore, the intraluminal duodenal pH was noted to be below 4.0 during the postprandial period in all patients. These data suggest that in cystic fibrosis, the greater therapeutic efficacy of pH-sensitive enteric-coated preparations over conventional preparations may be related to the protection of pancreatic enzymes from the highly acidic milieu in the duodenum, allowing for possible bioavailability in the distal small intestine.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we measured fat absorption from a large test meal in six patients with pancreatic insufficiency after we had instilled Viokase directly into the postcibal duodenum in two doses, one to deliver lipase at about 10% of normal secretory rates and the other at four times this rate. Direct duodenal instillation of neither the low nor the high dose of Viokase, nor the low dose of Viokase plus sodium bicarbonate, normalized fat absorption from the test meal; none of these duodenal instillations significantly improved fat absorption over that after the test meal plus orally ingested Viokase. Despite these various treatments, the patients excreted an average of 25.5 g of dietary fat as opposed to 2.1 g excreted by six normal subjects after the same meal. We conclude that more than just intragastric destruction of lipase underlies the frequent failure of orally ingested pancreatin to normalize fat absorption in pancreatic insufficiency.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed in order to delineate the combined effects of protein deficiency and chronic ethanol ingestion on the rat pancreas. Rats fed ethanol in combination with protein-deficient diets developed marked steatosis, whereas alcohol ingestion with nutritionally adequate diets and protein deficiency alone each were associated with a more moderate degree of pancreatic lipid accumulation. On biochemical analysis, it was found that protein deficiency decreased pancreatic phospholipid content. Furthermore, both protein deficiency and chronic ethanol consumption increased pancreatic cholesteryl ester content, and their effects were additive. Functional changes were studied using isolated pancreative acini. Protein deficiency depressed the tissue content of lipase and the ability of pancreatic acini to secrete lipase. Chronic ethanol feeding increased lipase levels in the acini and also their secretory capacity. Thus, to the extent that enzyme accumulation in the pancreas plays a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic pancreatitis, these results may explain the higher incidence of pancreatitis in well-nourished alcoholics that has been documented in dietary surveys.\r"

Since both the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and hyperparathyroidism, components of the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome (MEN I), are often associated with peptic ulcer, we have studied serum PG I concentrations in members of six well-defined families with MEN I. Serum PG I concentrations in 20 family members with hyperparathyroidism ranged from 35 to 864 ng/ml compared to 21-92 ng/ml in 16 nonaffected MEN I members. However, serum PG I levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in the hyperparathyroid patients with hypergastrinemia (PGI median 192, range 75-864 ng/ml) than in those with normogastrinemia (PGI median 75, range 35-139 ng/ml). In fact, five of seven patients with hyperparathyroidism and hypergastrinemia compared to only one of 13 hyperparathyroid patients without hypergastrinemia had increased serum PG I levels above 130 ng/ml. We conclude that in the MEN I syndrome, increased serum PG I levels are found in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome but not in hyperparathyroid patients with normogastrinemia and not in nonaffected MEN I members. The results indicate that in familial MEN I, hyperpepsinogenemia I is not inherited as a genetic trait but suggest that the elevated serum PG I levels are secondary to chronic hypergastrinemia.\r"

Of the preoperative symptoms, bilious vomiting and heartburn completely disappeared postoperatively in all the subjects. Fasting bile reflux was significantly reduced (bile reflux was annulled in six and considerably lowered in the remaining six subjects), and erythema of the gastric mucosa completely disappeared in all the subjects after diversion. Among histological findings, while a significant regression of foveolar hyperplasia was found both in the perianastomotic area and in the body of gastric remnant, none of the other aspects identifiable in postgastrectomy gastric mucosa (chronic gastritis changes included) were affected by diversion. These results show that biliary diversion is effective in correcting reflux, bilious vomiting, erythema, and foveolar hyperplasia of the gastric mucosa and confirm the suggested relationship between bile reflux and gastric foveolar hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The results of the few studies on the effect of the thyroid status on nitrogen metabolism have been inconclusive and/or contradictory. In an attempt to elucidate this important relationship, we have studied the effect of experimental hypo- and hyperthyroidism on urea biosynthesis and related processes. We have found that the capacity of the liver to synthesize urea was increased in hypothyroid rats, as were the activities of the urea cycle enzymes; there were also changes in the activities of some related enzymes and in the levels of intermediates and amino acids. Isolated hepatocytes from these rats showed an increased capacity for urea synthesis. In hyperthyroid rats the picture was more complicated, since there was no change in the urea-synthesizing capacity of the liver, although there were changes in some enzymes and metabolites. Our results suggest that there may be more endogenous proteolysis in hypothyroidism which would increase ammonia production, the ammonia being used primarily for urea biosynthesis and, to a lesser extent, for glutamate and aspartate synthesis. These overall effects might be the result of an increase in glucagon and/or cAMP, which, as is well known, increase the urea-synthesizing capacity of liver. In hyperthyroidism, on the other hand, the changes in nitrogen metabolism could be the result of an increase in protein synthesis, a decrease in catabolic activity, or both.\r"

Three metabolites were recovered from the liver incubation: 7 alpha-methyl-estr-4-ene-3,17-dione, 7 alpha-methyl-5 beta-estrane-3,17 beta-diol, and 7 alpha-methyl-3-oxo-estr-4-ene-16,17 beta-diol, whereas prostate and epididymis did not perceptibly metabolize the steroid. The kinetics of metabolism in liver differed significantly from those of testosterone or 19-nortestosterone. About 85% of the 7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone added was recovered at the end of 30 min of incubation. We conclude that the androgenic potency of 7-alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone is not dependent on its further conversion to 5 alpha-dihydro-metabolites.\r"

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue or hypothyroid pituitary tissue were incubated with D-[2-3H]mannose for 6 h. [3H]Mannose-labeled TSH or free alpha-subunits were obtained from homogenates using specific antisera and were digested with N-glycanase in their native state or after heat denaturation and reduction in the absence or presence of detergents. Tryptic fragments of the digestion products were then analyzed by reverse phase HPLC so that the effects of N-glycanase at the individual glycosylation sites could be determined. N-Glycanase treatment of native molecules did not cleave oligosaccharides efficiently at Asn56 of alpha-subunits and Asn23 of TSH beta, whereas oligosaccharides at Asn82 of alpha-subunits were more susceptible regardless of whether the alpha-subunits were combined with TSH beta. Heat denaturation, reduction, and the presence of detergents did not substantially increase the cleavage by N-glycanase of the protected oligosaccharides, suggesting that the primary structures of the TSH subunits influenced efficiency at specific sites. Pretreatment of free alpha-subunits with trypsin failed to enable N-glycanase to work fully, as oligosaccharides at Asn56 were cleaved less effectively than those at Asn82. Thus, the susceptibility to N-glycanase differs at the individual glycosylation sites of mouse TSH and free alpha-subunits, and these differences may result from effects of the primary structures of the TSH subunits.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that administration of an orally active competitive aromatase inhibitor 4-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo [1,5a] pyridin-5-yl) benzonitrile monohydrochloride to adult male beagles increases peripheral blood LH and testosterone concentrations, and that testes from treated dogs produce more testosterone when perfused in vitro than age-matched controls. In the present study we posed the question of whether the increased testosterone secretion by testes from these same aromatase-treated dogs was due to Leydig cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia, and if the latter, whether cytoplasmic organelles are increased. Beagles were treated with the inhibitor at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg.day for 25 weeks and were euthanized by an overdose of iv sodium pentobarbital; testes were perfusion-fixed, embedded, and sectioned for stereological analysis. There were no significant differences in testis volume and absolute volumes of seminiferous tubules, blood vessels, lymphatic space, macrophage cells, and mesenchymal cells between the control and treated dogs. In contrast absolute interstitium volume and the absolute volume of Leydig cells per testis were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in treated dogs. This increased Leydig cell volume per testis was due to increased volume of individual Leydig cells rather than to increases in Leydig cell number per testis. Additional studies showed that the surface area per Leydig cell of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, and membranes of lipid droplets per testis were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the treated dogs as compared to the controls. In summary, the results of this study lead us to conclude that aromatase inhibition in the mature dog causes Leydig cell hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia and increased surface area per Leydig cell of subcellular organelles that contain enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis.\r"

Daily injection of T4 (0.1 microgram/g BW) to intact pups starting 3 days before death at 10, 15, and 20 days of age resulted in a precocious increase in pancreatic glucocorticoid-binding capacities. Intact pups made hypothyroid by propylthiouracil feeding exhibited lower glucocorticoid-binding capacities in their pancreata. Scatchard analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of glucocorticoid-binding sites in the pancreata of T4-treated intact rats compared to that in normal intact rats. In hypothyroid groups the number of glucocorticoid-binding sites was much lower than that in normal intact rats. The Kd values, however, were unchanged in hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, and control groups. Rat pups who underwent adrenalectomy at 12 days of age had undetectable plasma corticosterone levels and showed an increase in their pancreatic glucocorticoid-binding capacity 3 days after operation. Replacement of corticosterone resulted in a binding level similar to that in the sham-operated group. However, injection of T4 alone to adrenalectomized pups led to a further increase in pancreatic glucocorticoid-binding capacity above that due to adrenalectomy alone. When both T4 and corticosterone were given together to adrenalectomized pups their pancreatic glucocorticoid-binding capacities increased to levels above those in the adrenalectomized group, but lower than those in pups receiving T4 alone. Our results suggest that T4 modulates the development of rat pancreatic glucocorticoid receptors and, at least in part, acts via pathways independent of adrenal function.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)ergic nerves innervate both the neurohypophysis and the hypothalamus. To test the hypothesis that VIP is a releasing factor for neurohypophyseal hormones, rats were given intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of VIP in doses varying from 0.3 pmol/kg.min to 3 nmol/kg.min for 5 min (0.001-10 micrograms/rat). Serial blood samples were drawn from the vena cava for measurement of oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP), and VIP by RIA. After the VIP infusions mean plasma OT and AVP levels rose in a dose-dependent manner; the rise was significant for both hormones at the dose of 300 pmol/kg.min. Peak levels after infusion of 3 nmol/kg.min were greater for OT than AVP [96.1 +/- 14.7 vs. 33.9 +/- 9 microU/ml (mean +/- SE); n = 6]. In addition, the concentration of plasma OT increased more promptly than that of AVP. Plasma OT was significantly raised over control values at 5 min, whereas plasma AVP was not increased until 15 min after the VIP infusion began. The concentration of VIP in peripheral plasma rose somewhat after icv infusions (maximum, 300 pmol/liter 30 min after 10 micrograms/rat), but the rise was only 5% of that observed after systemic infusions of equimolar doses of VIP (maximum, 6000 pmol/liter 5 min after 10 micrograms/rat). Peak plasma OT levels after administration of 3 nmol/kg.min VIP were significantly higher after icv than after systemic infusion of the same dose of VIP reported previously. Intravenous injection of 0.5 ml VIP antiserum with a binding capacity of VIP of 2.3 micrograms/ml before the icv administration of VIP (1 microgram/rat) did not prevent the VIP-induced rise in plasma OT and AVP. These observations suggest a central site of action for VIP in OT and AVP release, probably in the hypothalamus. The results are in harmony with the hypothesis that endogenous VIP is a physiological regulator of OT and AVP release in rats.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid response of hepatic mRNA-S14 to T3 has made this sequence an important model for studying the mechanism of hormonal induction of gene expression. In previous studies we showed, in the intact rat, that glucagon administration during the peak of the mRNA S14 diurnal rhythm causes a monoexponential fall in the level of mRNA-S14, and that T3 reverses this effect. We have now defined more precisely the mechanism governing this interaction. Measurement of in vitro nuclear transcriptional rates shows that T3 can reverse the glucagon-induced reduction of mRNA-S14 transcription. Reversal can be demonstrated within 5 min after the iv injection of T3. Further, the reversal appears to be related to the occupation of specific nuclear receptors, as inferred from the calculated nuclear occupancy and the effects of various iodothyronine analogs of T3. These results suggest that the effects of T3 are mediated by varying rates of production of the nuclear precursor and not by its stabilization, as previously proposed. Ancillary evidence supporting this conclusion came from the demonstration that the apparent t1/2 of the 4.5-kilobase precursor was not prolonged by T3.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological significance of locally produced prostaglandins (PGs) in the regulation of the functional lifespan of the primate corpus luteum is unknown. In the current study, the PG synthesis inhibitor sodium meclofenamate was administered to adult female rhesus monkeys beginning in the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Meclofenamate was infused continuously for 7 days into the corpus luteum (100 micrograms/h, n = 6) or the jugular vein (100 micrograms/h, n = 3; 1000 micrograms/h, n = 3) via osmotic minipump. As controls, PBS was infused into the corpus luteum (n = 7) or jugular vein (n = 5). In some of the monkeys receiving intraluteal infusions, chronic aortic and utero-ovarian venous catheters were implanted, and blood samples were collected on alternate days for the measurement of PGE and PGF2 alpha by RIA. Saphenous venous blood was collected daily, and progesterone and cortisol levels were determined by RIA. LH levels were determined by the mouse Leydig cell bioassay. Progesterone levels over 5 days preceding treatment were not different among groups. A decline in progesterone levels on day 1 after surgery was observed in all treatment groups and was accompanied by a 1-day elevation in cortisol levels. Thereafter, five of seven monkeys who received intraluteal infusions of PBS displayed normal progesterone patterns during treatment and normal luteal phase lengths of 15.4 +/- 1.2 days (mean +/- SEM). In six monkeys that received intraluteal infusions of meclofenamate, progesterone levels typically fell to less than 1 ng/ml within 72 h after initiation of infusion; progesterone levels during 7 days of intraluteal infusion were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in meclofenamate- vs. PBS-treated monkeys. Meclofenamate infusion into the corpus luteum significantly shortened (P less than 0.01) the luteal phase to 10.5 +/- 1.0 days. In contrast, progesterone levels during 7 days of meclofenamate infusion into the jugular vein did not differ from those in PBS-treated monkeys, and the length of the luteal phase was unaltered. LH levels, measured daily, did not differ among groups either before or during treatment. Although an venous/arterial gradient in PGE was detected at the time of surgery, we were unable to detect a significant gradient across the ovary in PGE or PGF2 alpha at any time after surgery in monkeys treated with either PBS or meclofenamate. The present data suggest an obligatory luteotropic role for locally produced metabolites of arachidonic acid, but a physiological role for either PGE or PGF2 alpha in regulating the primate corpus luteum remains equivocal.\r"

LH concentration measured by RIA in plasma samples obtained at 10 min intervals was analyzed using the PULSAR computer program to identify and characterize pulses observed in the LH profile of each rat individually. Multiple pulses were identified in seven of seven OVX rats but in only two of eight OVX rats primed with EB. Multiple pulses were identified in OVX EB-primed rats pretreated with ketanserin (six of seven), metergoline (three of seven), and methysergide (six of eight). Administration of the serotonin (5HT) agonist quipazine (2 mg/kg iv) to OVX rats inhibited pulsatile LH release and depressed mean plasma concentrations for approximately 45 min. This inhibitory response was antagonized by pretreatment of the OVX animals with ketanserin. These results suggest that 1) quipazine inhibits pulsatile LH release in OVX rats by a serotonin2 receptor mechanism; and 2) the inhibitory effect of estrogen on pulsatile LH release may also be mediated, at least in part, via 5HT2 systems.\r"

Analysis of the purified material by silver staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (with or without reducing agents) revealed a prominent broad band corresponding to a 93K protein and several minor contaminants. That the 93K band represents the LH/CG receptor is supported by the following. 1) This band is absent in material purified from rat luteal tissue in which the LH/CG receptor had been down-regulated. 2) [125I]iodohCG binding to Western blots of both the initial detergent extract and the purified material resulted in binding to a 93K protein. The 93K protein representing the LH/CG receptor was excised after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the purified material and was electroeluted. Half of the electroeluted receptor was incubated with reducing agents. After mixing with nonreduced receptor, this mixture was used to immunize one rabbit. Immune, but not preimmune, serum (or immunoglobulin G purified thereof) recognized a 93K protein on Western blots of partially purified (approximately 10% pure) rat luteal receptor. No other bands were seen. Using this approach it was determined that the antiserum recognized reduced, nonreduced, denatured, and native forms of the receptor. A polyclonal antibody to the LH/CG receptor will be useful for studies on the structure and regulation of this receptor.\r"

Whereas Ao messenger RNA (mRNA) was undetectable in fetal livers, Ao sequences were readily detectable 1 h after birth and reached a peak at 24 h of birth. Levels remained elevated at 5 and 10 days after birth to decrease slightly at 90 days of postnatal life. Poly A+ enriched liver RNA was subjected to a similar analysis demonstrating that fetal liver Ao mRNA levels were 50-fold less than the corresponding adult levels. In contrast to the finding in the fetal liver, Ao mRNA was found in fetal brown fat, brains, and kidneys.

L-T3 uptake was temperature sensitive: the initial velocity of uptake at low substrate concentration was 40 times higher at 37 C than at 0C whereas, at equilibrium, the ratio of cell-associated to extracellular L-T3 was about 7 times lower at 37 C than at 0 C. When [125I]L-T3-loaded erythrocytes were diluted into a serum albumin-containing medium, the efflux of L-T3 proceeded at a rate similar to that of influx. A large excess of unlabeled L-T3 in the medium blocked influx and efflux of labeled L-T3, indicating a saturable carrier-mediated transport process across the plasma membrane. the transport obeyed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 53 nM and a Vmax of 4.3 pmol/min.10(8) cells at 0 C. The Km increased only slightly with temperature whereas the Vmax was 100 times higher at 37 than at 0 C. The Arrhenius activation energy of uptake was 21 Cal/mol. The nonsaturable adsorption of L-T3 to the cells did not exceed 1% of the equilibrium levels at 0 C and 10% at 37 C. Uptake of L-T3 was very specific: unlabeled L-T4, D-T3, triiodothyroacetic acid, rT3, and DL-thyronine inhibited uptake with inhibition constant (Ki) values which were 35, 60, 65, 110, and 250 times, respectively, greater than the Km of L-T3. [125I]L-T4 uptake was negligible. L-T3 uptake and L-T4 inhibition of L-T3 uptake were pH dependent. It is suggested that only the unionized 4'-OH forms of the hormones were recognized by the transport system. At equilibrium, L-T3 was accumulated within the cell (apparent intracellular concentration approximately 50 times higher than that in the medium at 37 C). However, uptake was not dependent on the transmembrane Na+ gradient, suggesting facilitated rather than active transport. Analysis of L-T3 binding to erythrocyte cytosolic proteins suggested that they were implicated in the intracellular trapping of L-T3. At a concentration of 5 x 10(9) erythrocytes/ml (approximately the blood concentration), the amount of L-T3 accumulated in the cells was 13.5 times higher than the extracellular amount. We conclude that L-T3 is solely transported by a saturable, stereospecific, and Na+-independent carrier system. The intracellular accumulation and the rapid transmembrane movements of L-T3 suggest that erythrocytes might play a role in the interorgan transport of L-T3.\r"

  ".W": "Although dopamine inhibits PRL release from the normal anterior pituitary lactotroph, a conclusive demonstration of the mechanisms involved in this response has been impeded by the presence of other cell types in the anterior pituitary. To circumvent this problem, we have isolated a clonal cell line, designated MMQ, from the 7315a rat pituitary tumor. The MMQ cell is an exemplary model for our use because it only secretes PRL. Our studies show that dopamine inhibits secretagogue-induced PRL release from these cells. In addition, dopamine decreases the intracellular cAMP concentration in MMQ cells that have been exposed to forskolin, cholera toxin, or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, each a stimulator of cAMP generation. This inhibition is, in turn, reversed by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol and by pertussis toxin, an inactivator of the GTP-binding coupling protein. Dopamine also decreases the uptake and fractional efflux of 45Ca2+ by MMQ cells that have been exposed to the calcium channel activator maitotoxin. It seems, therefore, that dopamine decreases PRL release from MMQ cells at least in part by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels and calcium uptake. In additional experiments, we have found that MMQ cells are responsive to somatostatin, estrogen, progesterone, and acetylcholine, but not to TRH, angiotensin II, neurotensin, or bombesin. Furthermore, these cells possess a functional protein kinase-C system, as evidenced by the increase in PRL release and decrease in stimulated intracellular cAMP levels that occur in response to treatment with phorbol diesters. We suggest that the MMQ cell line will prove a useful model system for study of the biochemical effects of dopamine and other factors that modify PRL release.\r"

Pregnant mice received a Silastic estradiol implant on day 17 and were ovariectomized on day 19 of pregnancy. Twenty-four hours after ovariectomy 10 prematurely delivered fetuses were each injected with 0.33 microgram/100 g BW [125I]progestin (SA, 2200 Ci/mM). To show specificity of progestin localization two additional fetuses were each injected sc with 20 micrograms R5020, a synthetic progestin, 1 h before the injection of [125I]progestin. The fetuses were frozen 2 h after injection of [125I]progestin, sectioned, and processed for thaw-mount autoradiography. Cells with nuclear uptake and retention of radioactivity were observed in numerous tissues, including certain regions of the oral mucosa and developing teeth, esophagus, larynx, skin, mammary gland, skeletal muscle, kidney, and reproductive glands and ducts. Injection of unlabeled R5020 1 h before [125I]progestin prevented nuclear concentration of radioactivity in all target tissues. The results indicate that progesterone receptors are expressed with a regional, cellular, and subcellular distribution in term fetal mouse tissues and suggest that progesterone is important to the growth and development of certain fetal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported a synergistic effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] and agents that elevate intracellular cAMP to induce the expression of the C5a complement receptor in U937 cells. In this report we examine the mechanism of this synergy, considering the hypothesis that the steroid hormone works by facilitating what is ultimately a cAMP-dependent process. We show that U937 cells cultured with 1,25-(OH)2D alone before culture with prostaglandin (PGE2) alone will express C5a receptor (an average of 55 +/- 4% of the receptors expressed with continuous exposure of cells to both agents; P less than 0.05). The reverse, PGE2 followed by 1,25-(OH)2D, causes very little receptor induction. This demonstrates the ability of 1,25-(OH)2D to induce changes in the state of the cell, such that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase has effects that are otherwise not seen, in other words 1,25-(OH)2D can prime the cell for the subsequent action of the cAMP messenger system. Furthermore, we are able to substitute, during the priming period, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for 1,25-(OH)2D. Cells cultured for 24 h with CHX will express C5a receptor when cultured for a second 2-day period with PGE2 at about 77 +/- 7% of the amount obtained with simultaneous exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D and PGE2. The CHX effect is time dependent and visible after 2 h. CHX is not synergistic with 1,25-(OH)2D. Other agents that can also substitute for 1,25-(OH)2D, but not for cAMP, in facilitating C5a receptor expression include retinoic acid and ionomycin, but with less potency. The 1,25-(OH)2D and PGE2 synergy is sensitive to the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, implicating its dependence on the maintained elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. The synergy does not appear to be sensitive to changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium. We conclude from these results that 1,25-(OH)2D may promote the expression of C5a receptor in these cells in a fashion similar to that by which CHX potentiates other genes, i.e. that 1,25-(OH)2D increases levels of the mRNA encoding the C5a receptor. The mechanism of cAMP's subsequent and necessary action in the induction of C5a receptor expression is not yet clear.\r"

Adult male rats were used to provide tissue, which was homogenized ultrasonically and extracted on C18 minicolumns. The extracts were then assayed in a RIA for digoxin, and the ability of tissue extracts to displace radioiodinated digoxin from its antibody was determined. Consistent displacement was produced by extracts of whole adrenal gland, but not by whole brain and brain regions, anterior or posterior pituitary gland, skeletal muscle, aorta, testis, kidney, spleen, atrium, or ventricle. In some samples, extracts of liver also produced displacement of digoxin tracer. Further experiments were performed to determine whether bilateral adrenalectomy was able to influence plasma levels of the endogenous digitalis-like factor. Forty-eight hours after adrenalectomy, plasma levels of the factor were significantly reduced in whole plasma and ether extracts of plasma and were insignificantly lower in C18 extracts of plasma. These findings suggest that the endogenous factor we have studied previously in plasma may be derived from the adrenal gland.\r"

  ".W": "The specific beta-adrenergic radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) was used to identify and characterize beta-adrenergic receptors in bovine pituitary folliculo-stellate cells (bFSC) grown in culture. Saturation analysis demonstrated the binding of ICYP to bFSC particulate fractions to be of high affinity (apparent Kd = 80 pM) and low capacity (Bmax = 37 fmol/mg protein). The specific beta-adrenergic radioligand [3H] dihydroalprenolol also bound to bFSC particulate preparations with parameters compatible with binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor (Kd = 3.0 nM; Bmax = 52 fmol/mg protein). No specific binding was observed with either the dopamine receptor radioligand [3H]spiperone or the alpha-adrenergic radioligand [3H]dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine. The bFSC beta-adrenergic receptors were further characterized by computer modeling of competition studies with a variety of agonists and antagonists selective for beta-adrenergic subtypes. The pharmacological profiles of ICYP binding obtained from these studies indicated that approximately equal proportions of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic subtypes are expressed in cultured bFSC. Bovine FSC beta-adrenergic receptors are functionally coupled to activation of cAMP. The beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine provoked a rapid and marked stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation. The approximately equipotent effect of epinephrine and norepinephrine indicated that the beta-adrenergic effect on cAMP production is principally mediated via the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. The identification of beta-adrenergic receptors on bFSC positively coupled to adenylate cyclase provides a possible regulatory control pathway for the proposed role of pituitary FSC in the modulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological role of relaxin during pregnancy and at parturition in the rat is not absolutely established. There are limitations to the experimental approach used in the few studies that examined the influence of relaxin in the pregnant rat. These studies were unphysiological, since they involved administration of porcine relaxin as well as progesterone and estrogen to ovariectomized pregnant rats. A more physiological approach is to use antibodies to neutralize the biological actions of endogenous relaxin in the intact pregnant rat. The purpose of the present study was to produce and characterize monoclonal antibodies suitable for this approach. Six stable and rapidly growing hybridoma clones which produced monoclonal antibodies specific for rat relaxin (MCA-rR) were obtained after the fusion of NSO mouse myeloma cells with lymphocytes from the spleen of a BALB/c mouse immunized with rat relaxin. Five MCA-rR (MCA1-5; all immunoglobulin G1 kappa) inhibited the ability of exogenously administered rat relaxin to increase the interpubic ligament length in estrogen-primed mice. Of the five MCA-rR that neutralized rat relaxin's bioactivity in vivo, MCA1 exhibited the highest relative affinity for rat relaxin. MCA1 was also highly specific for rat relaxin. MCA1 demonstrated no cross-reactivity with rat insulin, rat insulin-like growth factor I and II, or porcine relaxin-proteins that are structurally related to rat relaxin. In view of its high affinity and high specificity for rat relaxin as well as its ability to neutralize rat relaxin's bioactivity in vivo, MCA1 was selected for use in subsequent studies aimed at the neutralization of endogenous relaxin in intact pregnant rats.\r"

To that end, a monoclonal antibody specific for rat relaxin, designated MCA1, was used to passively neutralize endogenous relaxin in intact pregnant rats. MCA1 was administered iv to intact rats daily from days 12-22 of pregnancy. Animals were observed for birth continuously from 2100 h on day 22 until 1200 h on day 24. MCA1-treated rats exhibited significantly prolonged durations of straining and litter delivery as well as reduced incidence of live pups compared with controls. Whereas approximately 20-25% of fetuses and placentae were retained in utero at 1200 h on day 24 in MCA1-treated rats, neither fetuses nor placentae were retained in control rats. Passive immunization with MCA1 throughout the second half of pregnancy had no apparent influence on normal ovarian function. The time of occurrence of the antepartum decline in serum progesterone levels (functional luteolysis) as well as the time interval between the attainment of basal progesterone levels and the onset of litter delivery in MCA1-treated and control rats that delivered on day 23 were in close agreement with previous reports. In conclusion, the prolonged durations of straining and litter delivery, reduced incidence of live pups, and increased incidence of retained fetuses and placentae after passive immunization with MCA1 establish the physiological need for endogenous relaxin to attain normal delivery of the young in the rat.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if relaxin enables normal delivery by promoting the growth and modifying the tensile properties of the uterine cervix. To that end, a monoclonal antibody specific for rat relaxin, designated MCA1, was used to passively neutralize endogenous relaxin in intact pregnant rats. MCA1 or PBS vehicle was administered iv to rats daily from days 12-22 of pregnancy. Cervices were removed at 1200 h on day 22. Cervices obtained from MCA1-treated rats were much smaller and far less extensible than cervices obtained from control rats. Moreover, cervices from MCA1-treated rats were less able to accommodate stress created by extension than cervices from control rats. Passive neutralization of relaxin had no influence on 1) the weights of other reproductive tissues (uterus, placenta, and ovary), 2) the number of fetuses, and 3) the viability of fetuses. The present study indicates that in the rat endogenous relaxin is required for promoting cervical growth and softening during the second half of pregnancy. This work supports the hypothesis that the influence of endogenous relaxin on birth is attributable, at least in part, to its effects on the cervix.\r"

The 116,000 Mr protein was comprised of triplet isoforms, while the 81,000 Mr protein was a singlet. By contrast, protein blot analysis of secretory phase samples revealed a doublet isoform at 116,000 Mr and an 81,000 Mr singlet. Organ culture of human endometrium was used to mimic these changes in PR form in vitro. Although the triplet to doublet conversion was not realized in organ culture, time- and dose-related changes in PR form were achieved which were similar to the in vivo state. Furthermore, these changes preceded the progestin-mediated induction of the enzyme estradiol dehydrogenase in parallel cultures, demonstrating that this is a useful system in which to study the relationship between receptor modulation and initiation and maintenance of biological response.\r"

We have also performed a comparative analysis of these results, combined with corresponding kinetic indices of T4, T3, and rT3, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of normal thyroid hormone production, distribution, and metabolism. Tracer doses of 125I-labeled 3,3'-T2, 3',5'-T2, and 3'-T1 were separately injected iv, and blood samples were collected 6-12 times for each iodothyronine in optimized sequential kinetic studies designed to maximize the precision of kinetic parameters. Labeled iodothyronines were separated quantitatively from their metabolites in each plasma sample by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography. Conventional kinetic analysis of the resulting data generated distribution volume, clearance, turnover, and mean residence time indices for each iodothyronine, and concomitant compartmental analysis of the same data provided additional results useful for integration and comparative analysis of the 6 iodothyronines. Kinetic parameters for all but T4 and T3 were similar, suggesting that similar mechanisms are responsible for the transport, metabolism, and distribution of nonhormonal iodothyronines. All but T4 and T3 (and, to a much lesser extent, 3'-T1) were almost completely and irreversibly metabolized, whereas 24-30% of the hormones (and 6% of 3'-T1) were excreted as such in feces only. Three-pool models fitted individual plasma kinetic data sets best in all cases (for all 6 iodothyronines), each with a plasma, a slowly exchanging (slow), and a rapidly exchanging (fast) pool, and kinetic parameters of interest were quantified for each iodothyronine (Ti). Quantitative analysis of an integrated 18-pool model for all 6 Tis revealed several other features of physiological interest. The fractional transport rate of T3 into the fast pool (liver, at least) is about an order of magnitude larger than that for all other Tis, supporting the hypothesis that transport of T3 into fast tissues (e.g. liver cells) is selectively amplified relative to that of the 5 other iodothyronines studied. Simultaneous and direct comparison of the 6 plasma kinetic data sets also supports this result. In addition, composite slow tissue pools, which probably exclude liver and kidney, contained the largest whole body fractions of all Tis (greater than 50%), and these also appear to be major sites of whole body T4 monodeiodinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The enterohepatic circulation (recycling), intestinal (gut) distribution, metabolism, and excretion of enterally infused thyroid hormones were studied in the intact rat under approximately normal physiological steady state conditions. Rats with 7-day osmotic minipumps implanted ip received constant intraduodenal infusions to steady state of very small trace doses of either 125I-labeled T3 (T3*) or T4 (T4*). Enterohepatic and other pathways remained open to normal function, and in particular, there was no biliary diversion or ligation. Complete feces and urine were collected daily, to assess daily distributions of radioactivity and establishment of the steady state, which occurred by day 3. On day 7, rats were anesthetized, blood was sampled, whole intestine and minipumps were removed, and the gut was separated into six segments. Fecal samples and the contents of each gut section were homogenized, ethanol extracted, evaporated, and reconstituted in NaOH for quantitative aqueous chromatography along with infusate, urine, and plasma samples, on Sephadex G-25 columns. No T3* or T4* was found in urine, but feces contained 39% of the T3* infused and 36% of the T4* infused in steady state. Statistically significant amounts of both T3* and T4* in systemic plasma on day 7 clearly indicated absorption of the hormones from the intestine, distinctly demonstrating an enterohepatic circulation of T3 and T4 under experimental conditions closely approximating the physiological steady state. This also establishes the intestine (with its contents) as an exchangeable hormone pool, physiologically internal to the system regulating thyroid hormones and their distribution. Gut contents contained 52 times more T3* and 4.34 times more T4* than corresponding plasma pools in steady state. Kinetic analysis of the data indicated that somewhat more than half of the T3* or T4* infused was absorbed from gut to liver (primary absorption), and up to 34% of the T3* infused and 43% of the T4* infused reached the systemic circulation (secondary absorption/bioavailability). Gut contents longitudinal distribution data 1) confirm existing evidence that thyroid hormone conjugates, formed elsewhere, exist in gut contents and are hydrolyzed there; 2) demonstrate that deconjugation becomes quantitatively significant, and thus may be initiated, at the level of the cecum; and 3) strongly suggest that absorption of unconjugated hormone occurs from at least the small intestine, all under normal physiological conditions.\r"

Given the fact that thymic epithelial cells (TEC) express glucocorticoid receptors and that glucocorticoid hormones are known to modulate the expression of keratins, we decided to study the in vivo effects of hydrocortisone on KL1+ cells in normal and autoimmune mice. Within 24 h after a single injection of this steroid we observed a significant increase in the number of KL1+ cells. Interestingly, this effect was reversible and was no longer detected 7 days after treatment. Parallel studies analyzing the effects of hydrocortisone on the secretion of thymulin, a chemically defined thymic hormone revealed a transient decrease in serum levels of this hormone, but with different kinetics than the effects on KL1+ cells. Ontogenetic studies showed that the responsiveness of TEC to hydrocortisone, in terms of high mol wt cytokeratin expression, appeared late in fetal life and disappeared in aging animals. Importantly, aging, but also young adult, autoimmune mice were not responsive. In vitro experiments using a mouse TEC line confirmed the data observed in vivo demonstrating that the increase in KL1+ cells is a direct effect of hydrocortisone on TEC. The bulk of the data presently reported demonstrates that glucocorticoid hormone can act on TEC modulating the expression of both secretory and cytoskeletal protein families.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA was demonstrated in primary cultures of neuronal and glial cells from rat brain. On Northern blots, a rat IGF-I cDNA probe hybridized to RNA species of 7.5, 1.7, and 0.8-1.2 kilobases in total and poly(A)+ RNA from both cell types. Solution hybridization/RNase protection assays were performed using an antisense riboprobe complementary to the 5'-untranslated region as well as part of the coding region of rat IGF-I mRNA. These studies indicated that two of the previously described three possible alternative 5'-untranslated splicing variants (classes A and C) were expressed in neuronal and glial cells, with class C transcripts predominating. Neuronal cells also possessed extremely low levels of class B transcripts. Treatment of neuronal cell cultures with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduced IGF-I mRNA levels by 60%. Glial cell IGF-I mRNA levels were reduced by dexamethasone by up to 40%. These results suggest that glucocorticoid-induced reductions in IGF-I production could occur at the level of transcription and may underlie some of the actions of glucocorticoids in causing growth retardation and inhibition of cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "89004936\r", 
  ".W": "Gastrotropin (GT), a protein previously isolated from porcine ileal mucosa, with a molecular mass of 14,054 daltons, was extracted from canine ileum and purified to homogeneity. The canine and porcine peptides had similar relative molecular mass, charge, hydrophobicity, and amino acid compositions. Direct Edman degradation yielded no free amino acids, indicating a blocked NH2-terminus, and a partial sequence determination of the CNBr fragments demonstrated a high degree of homology with porcine GT. Previous studies have indicated that GT is a potent enterooxyntin, and to further characterize these observations we have investigated the actions of both porcine and canine GT on isolated enriched preparations of guinea pig and dog parietal and chief cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that GT is present in more than one species and that the cellular response to porcine and canine GT is identical. The efficacies of canine and porcine GT preparations in stimulating pepsinogen secretion and [14C]aminopyrine uptake were identical and equal to those of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) and pentagastrin. GT was 100-fold more potent than either of these two major secretagogues. Maximal [14C]aminopyrine accumulation was observed with 10(-8) M GT, with an ED50 of 2 x 10(-9) M compared to pentagastrin, which caused maximal accumulation at 10(-6) M and had an ED50 of 5 x 10(-8) M. Maximal pepsinogen secretion was observed with 10(-7) M GT, with an ED50 of 10(-10) M, compared to 10(-6) M for CCK8, with an ED50 of 10(-8) M. The maximal chief cell response to GT was unaffected by the addition of CCK8 or carbachol, but responded additively with forskolin, indicating that GT uses the same transduction mechanism as CCK8 and carbachol and does not involve the activation of adenylate cyclase. The ED50 values observed with both parietal and chief cells in these studies were close to the basal circulating levels of GT (3.5 x 10(-9) M) in adult pigs. These results clearly demonstrate that GT is a potent component of the enterooxyntin factor identified in studies of the role of the small bowel in the regulation of gastric secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of chronic glucocorticoid treatment on sympathoadrenomedullary function were assessed in conscious unrestrained Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cortisol (25 mg/kg.day), administered for 7 days using a sc reservoir pump, suppressed activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, as indicated by markedly decreased levels of corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone and decreased adrenal weight. Cortisol also decreased body weight and increased blood pressure to hypertensive levels without affecting plasma sodium or potassium. Basal levels of plasma epinephrine were markedly decreased, indicating suppression of adrenomedullary secretion. Plasma norepinephrine levels also were decreased, but to a smaller extent than epinephrine, and levels of dihydroxyphenylglycol, an intraneuronal metabolite of norepinephrine, were unaffected. Plasma catecholamine responses to nitroprusside-induced hypotension were not altered by cortisol. The results suggest that chronic cortisol treatment suppresses basal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical and basal adrenomedullary activity in conscious unrestrained rats without impairing reflexive activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary system.\r"

  ".W": "Based upon N-terminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog structure-activity relationship studies, position 12 was found to possess a wide structural latitude and was chosen as a site for single amino acid substitutions. Replacement of the naturally-occurring Gly with D-Trp at position 12 in the PTH antagonists [Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 and [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 increased in vitro receptor affinity. The D-Trp12 containing analogs were 12-fold more potent than their unsubstituted counterparts as inhibitors of PTH binding to renal and bone PTH receptors and 13-27-fold more potent as inhibitors of PTH-stimulated renal and bone adenylate cyclase activity. Based upon Scatchard analyses of saturation binding experiments and Schild analyses of adenylate cyclase experiments, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 was shown to interact with PTH receptors in a competitive manner. These studies demonstrate, therefore, that D-Trp12 substitution in PTH antagonists improves inhibitory properties in vitro and is compatible with a helical conformation at this position as a new direction for the design of PTH antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a co-culture system with mouse spleen cells and osteoblastic cells to examine the role of osteoblasts in osteoclast formation. When mouse spleen cells and osteoblastic cells isolated from fetal mouse calvariae were co-cultured in the presence of 10 nM 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3], numerous tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRACP)-positive mononuclear and multinucleated cells were formed within 8 days. Neither the same co-cultures without the vitamin nor separate cultures of either spleen cells or osteoblastic cells with the vitamin produced TRACP-positive cells. Salmon calcitonin (CT) markedly increased cAMP production in the co-cultures treated with 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. Autoradiographic studies clearly demonstrated that [125I]-CT specifically bound to the TRACP-positive cells formed in the co-cultures with the vitamin. When spleen cells and osteoblastic cells were co-cultured on dentine slices in the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, numerous resorption lacunae were formed on the slices. Neither co-cultures of alveolar macrophages and osteoblastic cells nor those of spleen cells and mouse skin-derived fibroblasts induced TRACP-positive cells even in the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. When spleen cells and osteoblastic cells were cultured separately from each other by a membrane filter (0.45 micron), no TRACP-positive cells were formed. These results indicate that osteoblastic cells are required for the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors in splenic tissues into multinucleated osteoclasts.\r"
