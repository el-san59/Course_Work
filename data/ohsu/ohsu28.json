  ".W": "Selenium deficiency has been implicated as contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle myopathy, anemia, increased cancer risk, and deranged immune function. Since these problems may also be associated with renal failure, and the kidney plays an important role in selenium homeostasis, we measured selenium and compared it with nutritional status in 24 stable hemodialysis patients, 12 chronic intermittent peritoneal dialysis patients, and 29 healthy controls. Whole blood and plasma selenium was determined by a spectrofluorometric method. For whole blood the mean (+/- SD) selenium levels were 0.11 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml in controls vs. 0.071 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml in hemodialysis cases and 0.052 +/- 0.006 micrograms/ml in peritoneal dialysis (p less than 0.005). Significant decreases were seen also for plasma and red blood cell selenium in all groups respectively. Pre- and postdialysis plasma and whole blood selenium levels showed no significant changes in both dialysis groups. However, predialysis residual peritoneal fluid did contain selenium (0.029 +/- 0.005 micrograms/ml). Some evidence of protein-energy undernutrition was noted in both dialysis groups compared with controls. However, no significant differences in nutritional parameters were noted between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. When all groups were combined, significant correlations were found between whole blood selenium and serum albumin (r = 0.61; p less than 0.001), triceps skin fold in females (r = 0.62; p less than 0.001), and midarm muscle circumference in males (r = 0.71; p less than 0.001). We conclude that low blood selenium is present in renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis. This abnormality is even greater in peritoneal dialysis cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intermediate uveitis (pars planitis) was the single most frequently diagnosed uveitic entity and accounted for 92 cases (15.4%). We compared our findings with those of previously published studies and found that, as new diseases occur and improved diagnostic techniques become available, the differential diagnosis of uveitis continues to change.\r"

Follow-up was shorter for the eyes treated with endophotocoagulation, but a log-rank analysis to allow for this variable confirmed the benefit of laser photocoagulation (P less than .05). The proportion of eyes requiring surgical removal of the hemorrhage was also significantly lower in the group receiving endophotocoagulation (P less than .05). The beneficial effect of intraoperative laser treatment was independent of the amount of preoperative laser treatment, aphakia, and indications for the original vitrectomy surgery.\r"

During dark adaptation foveal sensitivity and its relation to proportion of cone pigment present were normal, but the kinetics of regeneration of the pigments were markedly abnormal. Measurements were made to consider the possibilities that the disorders of regeneration were associated with altered light-catching capacities of the patients' cone pigments, deranged transport of visual cycle substances between the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, or lingering photoproducts. None of the mechanisms fully accounted for the observed kinetics. The results suggested that abnormal kinetics of regeneration are among the earliest signs of malfunction of the foveal photoreceptor-pigment epithelial complex in some of the retinal degenerative disorders.\r"

All of the patients developed epithelial defects in the postoperative period. The complications included bacterial corneal ulceration (two patients), sterile corneal ulceration and corneal perforation (one patient), and a keratinized corneal plaque with underlying sterile stromal infiltrate (one patient). The use of 5-fluorouracil, which is an antimetabolite with considerable corneal epithelial toxicity, after glaucoma filtering surgery frequently causes corneal epithelial defects that may lead to secondary complications. Patients receiving this drug should have their corneal status closely monitored. In patients with corneal epithelial disease, 5-fluorouracil should be used with caution.\r"

Infants with dilated or tortuous iris vessels were more likely to be intoxicated by cocaine (P less than .01). The presence of dilated or tortuous iris vessels in a neonate should signal the physician to rule out cocaine intoxication.\r"

Although both mechanisms have been shown responsible for experimental blowout fractures, the role of isolated rim trauma in producing clinical blowout fractures with entrapment of orbital soft tissues continues to be questioned. I examined a 69-year-old patient who developed a blowout fracture with clinical evidence of entrapment after isolated trauma to the orbital rim. Five days previously the patient had had a cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens in the ipsilateral eye, which remained undisturbed by the trauma. This case supports the role of a buckling force to the rim in producing orbital blowout fractures. Review of the circumstances of injury in large series of blowout fractures suggests that this mechanism may be operative in the majority of cases.\r"

The possibility was investigated that alterations in the level and composition of plasma lipoproteins may contribute to this phenomenon. The adherence of human mononuclear cells to primary bovine aortic endothelial cells was measured in an in vitro monolayer collection assay. Preincubation of endothelial cells with beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) from cholesterol-fed rabbits or with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) from cholesterol/saturated fat-fed cebus monkeys resulted in a significant increase in the subsequent adherence of monocytes to the endothelial cells. The effect of beta-VLDL was maximal at 100 micrograms protein/ml. The response increased with time when endothelial cells were incubated with beta-VLDL for 0-120 minutes, then remained maximal for up to 4 hours. The adherence of a human monocytic cell line (U937) to endothelial cells was also increased by beta-VLDL. These results suggest that diet-induced alterations in lipoprotein composition may contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions by affecting the adherence of monocytes to the arterial endothelium.\r"

The B10.D2 and DBA/2 mice were given injected methylcholanthrene several weeks later, and immune studies were performed several months after carcinogen treatment. In conventional quarters, DBA/2 fed the POLY diet survived poorly, and many were infected with Mycoplasma pulmonis, even if given the vehicle, tractinoin, only. B10.D2 mice survived well unless on the POLY diet and given methylcholanthrene. Nevertheless, only mice on the POLY diet were significantly immunosuppressed, and only T-cell-mediated cutaneous sensitivity reactions were affected. Antibody, natural killer cell, and natural cytotoxic cell responses were not influenced by the diets. The C3B6F1 mice were assessed for immune functions prior to carcinogen (ethylnitrosourea) instillation into the trachea, and no immunosuppression was detected. After instillation, mice on the POLY and MONO diets were suppressed for T-cell cutaneous responses. Deliberate infection with Mycoplasma pulmonis resulted in suppressed cutaneous T-cell responses in the POLY group of C3B6F1 mice, and aspirin partially reversed the immunosuppression. Mice on the FISH diet were resistant to immunosuppression. It is tentatively concluded that diets rich in w-6 polyunsaturated diets, while not directly immunosuppressive, do predispose animals to suppression of certain T-cell-mediated immune responses. This immunosuppression can be \"triggered\" by infection and/or by exposure to carcinogens.\r"

To evaluate these assays in an experimental situation, the carbon tetrachloride model of hepatic fibrosis was produced in the rat. With affinity-purified antibodies, ELISA assays were developed and used for detecting nanogram quantities of the aminopropeptides of Types I and III procollagen (pro-I and pro-III) in rat serum. Serum SGPT levels were also determined. Routine histologic staining, as well as immunofluorescent staining for localization of Types I, III, and IV collagen and the aminopropeptides of Types I and III procollagen were performed on corresponding livers. It was found that serum pro-III levels were elevated after 45 and 70 days of treatment (28 +/- 15.2 ng/ml and 21 +/- 3.4 ng/ml, respectively) but returned to normal levels after 90 days of treatment (less than 3 ng/ml). Serum pro-I levels were elevated after 45 days of treatment (1028 +/- 504 ng/ml) but were normal at 70 and 90 days of treatment. Serum SGPT values were elevated at 45 and 70 days of treatment but were normal at 90 days of treatment. The decline in serum pro-III levels appeared to parallel the noted decline in SGPT values. Linear regression analysis revealed a good correlation between pro-III levels and histologic inflammation (r = 0.886) but a poor correlation between pro-III levels and histologic fibrosis (r = 0.116). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the pro-III antigen persists extracellularly for at least 45 days. Therefore, serum assays of pro-III might reflect extracellular collagen degradation as well as active collagen secretion. This would limit the clinical utility of the pro-III assay as an unequivocal marker of active hepatic collagen deposition.\r"

  ".W": "For a study of the processes and mechanisms of pulmonary structural remodeling in fibrotic lungs and metaplastic squamous epithelial cells in fibrotic alveoli, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and light-microscopic morphometric observations were made of the lungs in acute and proliferative stages of diffuse alveolar damage (n = 40) obtained from biopsies and autopsies. Morphometry showed that intraalveolar fibrosis developed in the early proliferative stage and was more prominent than interstitial fibrosis. In the early proliferative stage, activated myofibroblasts migrated into intraalveolar spaces through gaps in the epithelial basement membrane. They then attached to the luminal side of epithelial basement membrane and produced intraalveolar fibrosis and coalescence of alveolar walls. This intraalveolar fibrosis was the essential factor in the remodeled lungs. Albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, and surfactant apoprotein were present throughout the hyaline membrane. Fibronectin was not found in hyaline membrane of the lesions in early acute stage but was demonstrated in later stages in outer layers of hyaline membranes and in the areas of intraalveolar fibrosis. Fibronectin may be responsible for the migration and proliferation of myofibroblasts in intraalveolar spaces. Metaplastic single-layered and stratified squamous epithelial cells were keratin-positive and surfactant apoprotein-negative. These metaplastic epithelial cells were frequently found in the alveoli with minimal Type II epithelial cell proliferation and in the grossly scarred alveoli.\r"

LTE4 and its tripeptide precursor, leukotriene C4 (LTC4) were injected subcutaneously in guinea pigs. With LTE4, venular labeling was intense at 1000 and 100 ng and slight at 10 ng, with extinction at 1 ng. LTC4 induced a ring of labeled venules around a blank central area, suggestive of vasospasm. The nonpeptidyl leukotriene LTB4 induced no labeling. Histamine (1000 ng) induced an area of vascular labeling about equal to that by 1000 ng LTE4, but the labeling of individual venules was more intense. By electron microscopy, LTE4 was found to induce gaps in the endothelium of the venules; the endothelial cells adjacent to the gaps bulged into the lumen and showed wrinkled nuclei, consistent with cellular contraction. This ultrastructural evidence suggests that LTE4 increases vascular permeability by contraction of endothelial cells selectively, in the postcapillary venules, as was previously demonstrated for other inflammatory mediators, including histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin.\r"

These monoclonals, which do not react with cultured epithelial cells or sections from normal thymus (except for some cells of Hassall's corpuscles), label a large number of cells in thymoma sections. In addition, they recognize cross-striations from skeletal muscle cells. Immunoblotting studies reveal that the proteins recognized on thymoma and muscle are in the same molecular weight range, suggesting that these proteins, which share a common epitope, are identical. These findings indicate that the production of circulating anti-cross-striational autoantibodies observed in most patients with thymoma could derive from immunization against a protein abnormally expressed by neoplastic epithelial cells.\r"

The authors used biotinylated lectins as probes and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex as visualant to identify and to compare the distribution of carbohydrate residues on paraffin sections from 74 cases. The findings demonstrate a difference in the staining pattern between normal acinar, islet, and ductal cells in each species and small differences in the staining pattern between the species. It is shown that in nodules of regenerative acinar cells and acinic cell carcinomas there is an increased staining intensity with Concanavalia ensiformis agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin-I, and wheat germ agglutinin. The pattern of lectin staining in regenerative cells and malignant acinar cells reflects the degree of cellular differentiation. Intensive apical staining characterizes a higher degree of differentiation, while dispersed staining is a major feature of poor differentiation. These findings suggest that malignant transformation of pancreatic acinar cells is associated with enhanced expression of glycoconjugates, which resembles that seen in a normal immature acinar cells.\r"

The percent B isoenzyme value of samples of normal intima (n = 315), fatty steak (n = 68), or fibrous plaque (n = 64) was used to define monoclonality, expressed as the [Z] score, the number of standard deviations from the mean percent B isoenzyme of samples of underlying media. Intimal thickness increased significantly with type of lesion, such that intima less than fatty streak less than fibrous plaque, and with the age of the patient. The percentage of monoclonal portions also increased with lesion type, such that 1% of samples of normal intima were monoclonal, compared with 4.4% of fatty streaks and 12.5% of fibrous plaques (P less than 0.005). Monoclonality increased with intimal thickness when normal intima, fatty streaks, and fibrous plaques were combined (P = 0.0001). When examined separately, normal intima showed a direct correlation between monoclonality and intimal thickness. In contrast, the monoclonality of fatty streaks was inversely associated with thickness (P = 0.016) and the monoclonality of fibrous plaques not related to thickness. When entered into a multiple regression model, lesion type and age, but not lesion thickness, significantly predicted monoclonality. The lack of association of intimal thickness with monoclonality suggests that it is the type of lesion that determines monoclonality and not merely its thickness. This implies that mechanisms other than clonal selection are responsible for the monoclonal characteristics of human atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "To unravel the contributions of corneal tissue in endocular inflammation, we examined the capability of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) to release leukocyte chemotactic factors (LCFs) following injury induced by the leukocyte product hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was chemically generated by the interactions of glucose and glucose oxidase prepared in serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM). For these studies, endothelial surfaces of isolated bovine corneas were incubated with glucose (1 mg/ml) and glucose oxidase (20 U/ml) for 4, 6, and 10 hours at 37 C/in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Supernatants were then removed and assayed for bovine neutrophil or mononuclear cell chemotactic activity. C5 fragment was our positive control for 100% chemotactic response. Corneas were also fixed in buffered formalin for histopathologic evaluation. Results of these studies indicated that 1) 6-hour interactions of the glucose (G)/glucose oxidase (GO) mixture with endothelial surfaces resulted in both endothelial cell injury (cytoplasmic vacuolization and convoluted nuclei) and production of chemotactic factors (via checkerboard analysis) specific for both neutrophils (58% maximum chemotactic response [MCR]) and mononuclear cells (75% MCR); 2) control corneas treated with either G or GO for 4 and 6 hours produced low levels of LCFs (5-15% MCR); 3) preliminary molecular weight characterization of cornea-derived LCFs obtained from corneas incubated with G/GO for 6 hours revealed the detection of chemotactic activity specific for mononuclear cells in two major fractions, one near the void volume (greater than 130,000 daltons) and one near the elution volume (less than or equal to 10,000-15,000 daltons). Chemotactic activity specific for neutrophils was detected only in one major fraction near the elution volume (less than or equal to 10,000-15,000 daltons); and 4) the production of these LCFs by isolated corneas was significantly inhibited, in a dose-response fashion, when the enzyme catalase (1200-6000 U/ml) was added to corneas incubated with G/GO for 6 hours. To investigate whether isolated CECs were capable of producing LCFs in response to G/GO injury, the authors incubated cultured bovine CECs with G/GO for 3, 6, and 20 hours at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Similar to isolated corneas, cultured CECs incubated with G/GO for 6 hours produced significant levels of LCFs specific for neutrophils (67% MCR) and mononuclear cells (75% MCR). Furthermore, the addition of catalase (3000 U/ml) to corneas incubated with G/GO for 6 hours markedly reduced the production of LCFs. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Four principal cell types involved in the pathophysiologic response of the vessel wall--endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocyte/macrophages--secrete platelet-derived growth factor-like (PDGF-like) mitogenic activities. Extensive structural data on these activities exist only for the mitogen produced by platelets, which is a 30-kd dimeric protein composed of structurally related A and B polypeptide chains encoded by different genes. It was previously demonstrated that normal cultured endothelial cells transcribe mRNA encoding the B chain of PDGF from the c-sis gene. Here several new structural features of the mitogen produced by cultured vascular endothelial cells are shown. Hybridization analysis of RNA from normal cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells revealed that they contain three PDGF A chain transcript species. These RNA species comigrated with and appeared to have the same relative abundance as the three RNA species previously identified in RNA from two human tumor cell lines. A chain transcripts were not identified in RNA from a strain of bovine aortic endothelial cells or in human dermal fibroblasts. The A chain transcripts in HUVE had the same relative abundance as the B chain transcripts. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled endothelial conditioned medium with anti-PDGF antiserum revealed a 31-kd species which was split by reduction and alkylation into two species of 16.5 and 17 kd. Thus, endothelial cells secrete a dimeric mitogen antigenically related to PDGF, with a structure identical to previously isolated PDGF A-chain homodimer. These findings are consistent with the possibility that secretion of PDGF by human endothelial cells may be regulated independently of B-chain expression.\r"

This study shows the existence of topographic differences in the tolerance to ischemia in the mid area, subendocardium, and subepicardium; that the sequestration of Ca2+ by mitochondria is an energy-requiring (active) process that occurs only during reperfusion; the loss of the sarcolemma's ability to bind Ca2+ during ischemia to coincide with increased Ca2+ entry during postischemic reperfusion (this Ca2+ is scavenged by mitochondria as long as sufficient energy remains available; these changes are interpreted as being at the edge of irreversibility); and the lack of additional damage and and lack of Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria during reperfusion in cells that are damaged to such an extent that mitochondria possess flocculent densities already at the end of the ischemic insult.\r"

The medical charts of 101 consecutive patients involuntarily admitted to a university-based acute inpatient unit were reviewed for evidence of violence within the first 72 hours of hospitalization. More than two-thirds of the patients committed as a danger to others engaged in some type of violence, compared with fewer than one-third of other involuntary patients. The findings suggest that the emergency commitment situation permits judgments of dangerousness with a relatively high degree of short-term predictive validity.\r"

  ".W": "Diverse psychological, interpersonal, environmental, and pharmacological factors that appear to trigger the onset of mania could act via their capacity to cause sleep deprivation, a mechanism that has been shown in experiments with bipolar patients to induce transient or sustained switches into mania. Since mania in turn causes insomnia, the development of mania is potentially self-reinforcing and could become autonomous after being initiated by precipitating factors. The sleep reduction model is based on experimental evidence and is a parsimonious explanation for the precipitation of manic episodes by a wide variety of factors. Furthermore, this model has clear implications for the prevention and treatment of mania and provides a conceptual focus and an experimental paradigm for psychological investigations of the causes of mania.\r"

Those who died of natural causes were more likely to have been admitted with medical diagnoses; no specific psychiatric diagnoses were associated with these deaths. It is doubtful that medical illnesses caused psychiatric syndromes such as depression in these inpatients. Psychiatric and medical illnesses combined may increase a patient's likelihood of seeking psychiatric help and entering the hospital.\r"

Since future numbers of adolescents and adults can be estimated on the basis of current population data for children and preadolescents, the epidemiologic patterns for suicide and homicide may be predictable for certain age groups. However, methodologic problems are inherent in using national mortality and population data, and many years are necessary to evaluate such epidemiologic propositions.\r"

The presence of auditory hallucinations was significantly associated with diagnosis, demographic variables, and use of maximal observation and seclusion. However, patients with command hallucinations were not significantly different from patients without commands on demographic and behavioral variables, including suicidal ideation or behavior and assaultiveness. These findings suggest that command hallucinations alone may not imply greater risk for acute, life-threatening behavior.\r"

As a result, the proportion of children having less than or equal to 60 per cent of median weight-for-age is overestimated by five percentage points and the proportion having less than 80 per cent of median height-for-age is overestimated by six points. Loss in sensitivity (proportion of malnourished children correctly identified) for the above cutoff points is 20 per cent for weight-for-age and 28 per cent for height-for-age, compared to the situation in the absence of age error. Although mother's education is not a significant determinant of weight-for-age and height-for-age, age error makes mother's education appear artifactually significant in the analysis of variance.\r"

A total of 7,635 deaths during 225,251 person-years of experience were observed. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios by time after bereavement were computed. The highest relative mortality risk was found immediately after bereavement. For all natural causes, mortality during the first week was over two-fold compared to expected rates. The relative risk was larger for ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.3 for men, and RR = 3.5 for women), an effect found in all age groups. Among men under age 65, excess mortality from IHD was also observed during later years of widowhood. For violent causes, exclusive of accidents simultaneously affecting both spouses, mortality was over two-fold during the first month. Mortality from suicides was greater than expected during the first years of widowhood. While the greatest excess mortality after bereavement seems to be due principally to the acute effects of becoming widowed, there also seems to be some excess mortality in younger persons widowed for a longer time.\r"

Three hundred of these women were participating in a prenatal screening program for neural tube defects. Although theoretical accounts of the effects of behavior on attitude would suggest that participation in a screening program would affect abortion attitudes, evidence in support of such an association was weak. The overwhelming majority of women, regardless of whether they had participated in the screening program, believed that women are justified in having an abortion in the face of fetal abnormality. There was a sharp increase in the number of screening program participants who said they would have an abortion when the probability of the fetus being affected with a neural tube defect rose from 95 per cent to 100 per cent.\r"

Eleven of the 15 nutrition objectives target adults or the public while four address pregnant and lactating women, infants, and children. To determine progress by states toward achieving the nutrition objectives, the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Nutrition Directors conducted a survey in 1985 to which 54 state and territorial nutrition directors responded. Three-fourths of the nutrition personnel focused efforts on maternal and child populations, and were supported largely by federal funds from the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. Only 15 per cent were funded by state and local sources. While most agencies reported using nutrition consultation in adult health programs, only 25 per cent paid for these personnel. Data to monitor progress were commonly available for only five of the 15 objectives. Achievement of the nutrition objectives by states will require a more comprehensive approach to nutrition programming with increased allocation of appropriate resources and expansion of health data systems.\r"

A detailed comparison was performed of the mortality patterns of \"thin\" (decile 1 of Quetelet's index) and \"average\" weight (deciles 4 and 5) cohort members who were age 40-79 years and free of illness at the beginning of follow-up. Thin male (relative risk 1.6, 95 per cent confidence limits 1.0, 2.6) and female (R.R. 2.1, 95 per cent C.L. 1.1, 3.9) current cigarette smokers were at increased risk of mortality compared with average weight smokers. Unmeasured differences between thin and average weight smokers with respect to quantity of cigarettes smoked may have contributed to the apparent association of thinness with mortality in smokers. Thinness was not associated with increased mortality in never smokers and ex-smokers (R.R. 1.0 in men and women). As association of long-term weight loss with mortality was present in thin and average weight men and in thin women.\r"

Those sustaining a severe head or spinal cord injury were at highest risk of not returning to work (only 43 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, had returned within the year). Low one-year employment rates (58 per cent) were also noted for individuals whose most severe injury was to one or more extremities. The extent and rate of return to work was examined in relation to selected socioeconomic and personal characteristics. Findings indicate that after controlling for type and severity of injury, personal income, and educational level of the injured person, as well as the identification of a strong social network as defined by the presence of one or more confidants, were important correlates of post-injury employment status.\r"

Blood cultures were obtained from two patients and Brucella melitensis was isolated. Employees working in areas with open windows above the laboratory air extracting system had an attack rate of 39.5 per cent, substantially higher than those working in other locations. When vaccine was manufactured again, an electric oven reaching 300 degrees C had been installed in the air extracting system just before its exit to the exterior. Appropriate culture medium plates were exposed to the laboratory air before and after passing through the oven. Brucellae were isolated from the plates exposed to the air before passing through the oven but not after doing so.\r"

  ".U": "87125430\r", 
  ".W": "In many countries a spouse, usually the husband, can veto a partner's use of family planning services. Where spousal veto acts as a barrier to family planning services it represents a serious threat to the lives and health of women and children. Removal of spousal authorization requirements has been shown to increase the use of family planning services. The Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, for example, removed their requirement in 1982 and clinic utilization increased by 26 per cent within a few months. Courts of several countries have held that spousal veto practices violate principles of personal privacy and autonomy and the right to health care. The effect of such judgements has been to reinforce rights to sexual nondiscrimination found, for example, in national constitutions and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. This article discusses the nature and application of spousal veto practices, explains how such requirements can violate certain human rights, and explores possible remedies to this problem, including ministerial, legislative, and judicial initiatives.\r"

Varus-valgus joint laxity was quantitatively measured using a device which allowed various degrees of freedom (DOF) of joint motion during application of a varus-valgus bending moment to the canine knee joint. When the knee motion was limited to 3 DOF (varus-valgus rotation, proximal-distal, and medial-lateral translation), valgus laxity increased significantly (171%) after sectioning the MCL. Thus, the MCL was the primary restraint to the valgus bending moment in the 3 DOF mode. However, the effect of sectioning the MCL on valgus laxity became minimal (21% increase) when the DOF of knee motion was increased to 5 (by adding axial tibial rotation and anterior-posterior translation). In this situation, external and internal tibial axial rotation were coupled with the varus and valgus rotation of the knee joint, respectively, and the ACL also functioned to restrain the varus-valgus rotation. The results of this study suggest that under normal knee joint motion, the functional deficit of the MCL in valgus rotation was compensated for by the remaining structures, especially by the ACL.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the healing of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and to detect the various effects of treatment regimens, in vivo animal experiments using a canine model were performed. Thirty-five canine MCLs were surgically transected and treated using three clinically popular regimens, e.g., no repair with cage and farm activities (Group 1), repair with 3 weeks immobilization (Group 2), and repair with 6 weeks immobilization (Group 3). The varus-valgus laxity of the knee joint, structural properties of the femur-MCL-tibia (FMT) complex and the mechanical properties of the MCL substance (healing site) were quantitatively measured at 6, 12, and 48 weeks postoperatively. It was found that Group 1 animals had the best results. The varus-valgus laxity of the knee joint and the structural properties of the FMT complex returned to values comparable with the contralateral control by 12 weeks. The recovery of the mechanical properties of the MCL substance was slower and not complete, even at 48 weeks. In confirmation with previous studies, prolonged immobilization was shown to have deleterious effects on MCL healing. The results of this study indicated that early mobilization is the treatment of choice in cases of isolated MCL injury. Also, this study emphasized the importance and effectiveness of using various biomechanical parameters in addition to the conventional ultimate values at failure to evaluate the progress of soft tissue repair.\r"

The world literature on the biomechanics and physiology of ice hockey was reviewed in an attempt to evaluate the forces and mechanisms involved in the game. The influence of rule and equipment changes on injury patterns was particularly studied. Several studies on the epidemiology of injuries, providing data on the types of injuries and the mechanisms of those injuries, were analyzed to determine the conclusions that could be supported and those that require further study. Possible changes in the patterns and types of injury are outlined.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed cases of 320 athletes with bone scan-positive stress fractures (M = 145, F = 175) seen over 3.5 years and assessed the results of conservative management. The most common bone injured was the tibia (49.1%), followed by the tarsals (25.3%), metatarsals (8.8%), femur (7.2%), fibula (6.6%), pelvis (1.6%), sesamoids (0.9%), and spine (0.6%). Stress fractures were bilateral in 16.6% of cases. A significant age difference among the sites was found, with femoral and tarsal stress fractures occurring in the oldest, and fibular and tibial stress fractures in the youngest. Running was the most common sport at the time of injury but there was no significant difference in weekly running mileage and affected sites. A history of trauma was significantly more common in the tarsal bones. The average time to diagnosis was 13.4 weeks (range, 1 to 78) and the average time to recovery was 12.8 weeks (range, 2 to 96). Tarsal stress fractures took the longest time to diagnose and recover. Varus alignment was found frequently, but there was no significant difference among the fracture sites, and varus alignment did not affect time to diagnosis or recovery. Radiographs were taken in 43.4% of cases at the time of presentation but were abnormal in only 9.8%. A group of bone scan-positive stress fractures of the tibia, fibula, and metatarsals (N = 206) was compared to a group of clinically diagnosed stress fractures of the same bone groups (N = 180), and no significant differences were found. Patterns of stress fractures in athletes are different from those found in military recruits. Using bone scan for diagnosis indicates that tarsal stress fractures are much more common than previously realized. Time to diagnosis and recovery is site-dependent. Technetium99 bone scan is the single most useful diagnostic aid. Conservative treatment of stress fractures in athletes is satisfactory in the majority of cases.\r"

A prospective analysis of club level gymnastic injuries over one season (1982-83) was conducted. Complete responses from 15 clubs (2,558 participants) were obtained. Parameters of clubs followed were: skill level, student, instructor ratio, safety equipment, and conditioning and warm-up exercises. Data obtained from each participant were: injuries sustained, event in which injury occurred, setting of injury, type of injury, and duration of disability. Results were 62 injuries among 542 competitive and 2,016 noncompetitive level athletes (5.3 per 100 competitors and 0.7 per 100 beginners). Of the 62 injuries, 51 were acute and 11 chronic. Twenty-one injuries occurred during floor exercises, 13 on beam, 9 on vault, 6 on uneven parallel bars, and 2 on springboard. Acute injuries included 21 sprains, 16 fractures, 6 contusions, 4 dislocations, and 4 muscle strains. A significant finding was the increased frequency of acute injury seen at dismount. Also there was a positive correlation between duration of frequency of practice (fatigue) and injury rate. We would define a high risk gymnast as one who is performing at an advanced competitive level, performing floor or beam exercises, and practicing more than 20 hours per week.\r"

  ".W": "Competitive swimmers have a high incidence of breaststroke-related knee injuries. Although previous investigators have implicated the terminal phase of the kick in the injury mechanism, athletes often complain of pain during the initial phase of rearward thrust. Disagreement in the current literature surrounds the precise anatomical derangement(s) constituting \"breaststroker's knee.\" The purpose of this investigation was to delineate the epidemiology, anatomy, and pathobiomechanics of breaststroke knee injuries. Descriptive data were obtained by surveying 391 athletes. An extremely high incidence of knee pain was documented both among breaststroke specialists (73%) and nonbreaststrokers (48%). Age, years of competitive swimming, and specific training characteristics were positively correlated with knee pain. Both the medial collateral ligament and the inferomedial patellar border were involved. A further 21 swimmers were assessed in detail using four methods: interview, physical examination, Cybex II isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring testing, and cinematographic analyses. The interview and physical examination data supported the conclusions derived from the descriptive data, while Cybex testing and kinematic film analyses failed to demonstrate statistical differences between the injured and noninjured groups. Although kinematic film analyses did not demonstrate statistical differences between cases and controls, dramatic differences in the injury rate were noted when hip abduction angles at kick initiation were less than 37 degrees or greater than 42 degrees. This bimodal increase in injury rates suggests that modification of hip abduction at kick initiation, in conjunction with altered training regimens, will lead to a reduction in medial knee joint stress and hence fewer breastroke injuries.\r"

Within this group, application of a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 failed to influence the reactivation rate as compared with a placebo. Reactivation of herpes triggered by skiing is common. As application of a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 did not appear to influence the reactivation rate, alternate approaches to the control of recurrent orofacial herpes are needed.\r"

To classify and number the diagnosis, a specific classification of sports injuries and diseases was drawn up. The data were stored and analyzed using a DEC-2060 computer at the University of Tampere. During 6 months a total of 814 visits were recorded. The three most common sports were soccer, long-distance running, and orienteering. Competitive athletes totalled 337 (62%); 43 of these were top-ranking athletes. The most common reasons for visits were problems of the knee (266 visits, 33%), ankle (80, 10%), and low back (71, 9%). Knee sprains accounted for 10% of all visits. Problems related to the musculoskeletal system were the reason for 751 (92%) of all visits. Operative treatment was needed by 49 patients (6%). The continuous coding system of patient visits at an outpatient sports clinic showed great advantages as a basic data bank for scientific research, annual statistics, and patient identification and filing. The system described has been adopted as part of the daily routine at the TRSSM.\r"

Right tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from 30 rabbits were strained to approximately 80% of failure while the left TA muscles served as control. Both injured and control muscles were then tested for ability to generate force. Seven animals were sacrificed immediately after testing and the muscles were examined grossly and histologically. Remaining animals were retested at 24 hours (N = 7), 48 hours (N = 8), and 7 days (N = 8). Contractile ability following injury was 70.5% of control immediately, 51.1% at 24 hours, 74.5% at 48 hours, and 92.5% at 7 days. Immediate histology showed limited distal fiber rupture and hemorrhage. By 24 hours, histology showed fiber necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, edema, and hemorrhage. At 48 hours there was complete fiber breakdown and intense inflammatory cell proliferation. At 7 days inflammation was reduced and collagen fibrosis more advanced. Our findings demonstrate that injured muscle begins functional recovery by 48 hours despite inflammation and active healing. This suggests that decreasing muscle function seen clinically between 24 and 48 hours following strain injury may result from pain due to inflammation. Scarring and fibrosis seen at 7 days may explain the frequent recurrence of injury to strained muscles.\r"

In two laboratory experiments, a Bangkok strain of Ae. aegypti was allowed to feed upon viremic monkeys infected with DEN-2 virus. Blood-engorged mosquitoes were separated into two groups and retained at constant temperatures. Virus infection and transmission rates were determined for Ae. aegypti at intervals ranging from 4 to 7 days during a 25-day incubation period. Results of the first experiment for mosquitoes infected with a low dose of DEN-2 virus and maintained at 20, 24, 26, and 30 degrees C, indicated that the infection rate ranged from 25% to 75% depending on the incubation period. However, DEN-2 virus was transmitted to monkeys only by Ae. aegypti retained at 30 degrees C for 25 days. In the second experiment, the infection rate for Ae. aegypti that ingested a higher viral dose, and incubated at 26, 30, 32, and 35 degrees C ranged from 67% to 95%. DEN-2 virus was transmitted to monkeys only by mosquitoes maintained at greater than or equal to 30 degrees C. The extrinsic incubation period was 12 days for mosquitoes at 30 degrees C, and was reduced to 7 days for mosquitoes incubated at 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C. These results imply that temperature-induced variations in the vector efficiency of Ae. aegypti may be a significant determinant in the annual cyclic pattern of dengue hemorrhagic fever epidemics in Bangkok.\r"

This is especially important in the tropical rabies-endemic areas where simultaneous passive prophylaxis with hyperimmune serum is not practicable in the majority of cases. We compared the rate of production of antibody during the first two weeks, by six vaccine regimens in 118 subjects using two tissue culture vaccines, human diploid cell strain vaccine (HDCSV) and purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV). No antibody was detected on day 5. On day 7, the highest seroconversion rate was seen in subjects given HDCSV intramuscularly at two sites on days 0 and 3 (7 of 15), but this was not significantly different from the group with the lowest rate: the conventional single-site intramuscular regimen. All subjects had antibody by day 14, at which time the highest geometric mean titer was in the group vaccinated with 0.25 ml doses of diploid cell vaccine given subcutaneously at eight sites. This regimen, together with the standard single-site diploid cell vaccine and an eight-site intradermal regimen of the same product gave significantly higher titers than the two-site intramuscular regimens of either product. No single immunization schedule emerges as best, so the speed of antibody response, economy, and the skill needed for intradermal injection should be considered when deciding on the optimum regimen for use in a particular geographic area.\r"

Epidemiological observations were made on at least 10% of the cattle in 4 dairy herds that were located in the vicinity of Grand Junction, Colorado. High rates of neutralizing antibody to the New Jersey serotype were seen in all cattle regardless of whether livestock in the dairy had clinical VS or a decrease in mild production. Antibody titers remained high in these cattle for as long as 2 years after the epizootic. No virus isolations were made from 32 humans with clinical signs compatible with viral disease. Entomological information was obtained during the epizootic from 23 premises in northwestern Colorado. Insect collections yielded 4 isolates from Culicoides spp. midges, 2 from C. variipennis, and 1 each from C. stellifer and C. (Selfia) spp. This is the first report of VS virus isolations from field-collected Culicoides.\r"

Veterinarians, research workers, and regulatory personnel who were exposed to vesicular stomatitis virus were examined for patterns of human infection and prevalence of vesicular stomatitis New Jersey serotype neutralizing antibody. Insight into the mechanism of transmission was sought by comparing activities of antibody-positive and antibody-negative persons. A statistically significant risk factor was a history of infected animals sneezing in the face of serosurvey participants. Elevated odds ratios were also calculated for those who usually examined the oral cavity of affected animals, had open wounds on hands or arms, and had exposure to saliva through the eye or skin. Relatively intimate direct contact was required; a higher risk was associated with examining horses than cattle. Neutralizing antibody prevalence was significantly higher among exposed persons with illness (23%) than in exposed persons without a history of clinical illness (7%). Overall, however, infectivity of VSNJ for humans during the epizootic was low.\r"

A similar antibody prevalence was noted to that of veterinarians and research and regulatory personnel who were involved with the same epizootic. Risk of infection resulted from intimate physical contact with infected horses or cows. Incidence and infection rates in horses were 45%; rates in cows were much lower, only 5%. Some epidemiologic clues were gained by a detailed study of an equine ranch. The pasture was incriminated as the area of highest risk, where 100% infection rates were noted. Horses in open pens and barns were at lower risk. Severe clinical disease in horses resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titers than inapparent or mild infection. Maternal antibody was detected in foals up to 4 months of age, and the level of antibody in the foal was a reflection of the dam's antibody level.\r"

High levels of genetic similarity and low levels of genetic distance were noted among comparisons of local populations of the same Leishmania, and lower levels of similarity and higher levels of distance were noted among intracomplex pairings. The biochemical data suggested that similarities and differences among Leishmania could be quantified as they have been in other organisms.

Primary infections occurred in 87% of exposed gerbils; cyst release peaked during the second and third weeks post-infection; cysts and trophozoites were observed for up to 49 and 87 days post-infection, respectively. Gerbils were refractory to challenge infection with infective human source cysts at 5 months post-infection. Overall, 50% of animals given subcutaneous injections of hydrocortisone acetate, during or following the late stages of their primary infection, showed recrudescence of infection as evidenced by passage of cysts; percentages showing recrudescence were: 80% at 50 days post-infection, 55% at 70 days post-infection, 27% at 7 months post-infection, and 50% (2 of 4) in gerbils challenged unsuccessfully at 5 months post-infection and subsequently injected with hydrocortisone acetate at 7 months post-infection. Both infected animals and uninfected controls injected with hydrocortisone acetate were immunocompromised as evidenced by significantly reduced plaque forming cell responses to sheep red blood cells. We conclude that infections with G. lamblia in gerbils can last longer than standard examinations for cysts would indicate, and that long-term immunity to this organism can be nonsterile.\r"

T. rangeli stocks displayed electrophoretically detectable polymorphism for only a single enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), in contrast with the marked phenotypic heterogeneity previously reported among the T. cruzi stocks.

Thus, defined immunochemical changes occur in microfilariae as they assume functional maturity.\r"

Other groups of mice received different doses of infective eggs, ranging from 5 to 1,250 eggs. Excretory-secretory antigens were collected from culture fluid in which mechanically hatched larvae of T. canis were maintained. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to monitor specific antibody responses. Circulating antigen levels were monitored using a direct ELISA which incorporated an IgG fraction of a rabbit antiserum to the excretory-secretory antigens as a capture antibody and a biotin-conjugated form of the same rabbit IgG as the second antibody. The antigen-specific IgM response was evident the first week of infection and peaked 3 to 6 weeks post-infection. The antigen-specific IgG response first appeared the second week of infection and peaked at 6 to 8 weeks post-infection. Both isotype levels stayed near their peak values for the remainder of the study. In the untreated sera, circulating antigen was initially evident and highest the first week of infection; the antigen concentrations dropped by the third month of infection to low, but significant, levels that persisted for the duration of the study. The administration of greater than 25 eggs produced antigenemias. There appeared to be a positive linear trend between the number of eggs given and the amount of antigen in the circulation.\r"

Nymphal I. dammini were used to infect mammals, and larval ticks were used to diagnose infection (a form of xenodiagnosis). One tick was nearly as efficient as more than 1 in transmitting the spirochete to mice. The duration of the prepatent period was about 1 week. Prevalence of infection approached 100% in ticks that fed as larvae on mice infected 2 or 3 weeks previously. Thereafter, infectivity gradually decreased, but duration exceeded 200 days. Hamsters, too, became infectious for larval I. dammini. This report formally demonstrates the life cycle of B. burgdorferi as it seems to occur in nature. We conclude that the white-footed mouse is a competent reservoir for the Lyme disease spirochete.\r"

The rats were maintained on their respective diets throughout the experiment. After 7 days, half the rats in each group underwent abdominal irradiation (200 rads). Seven days later, all of the rats underwent distal colon division and anastomosis under pentobarbital anesthesia. All rats were killed 7 days postoperatively, the colons excised, and bursting strength and hydroxyproline determinations performed on both the anastomotic segment and a normal proximal segment of adjacent colon. There was a significant decrease in the bursting strength at the colon anastomosis (p less than 0.02) and in the collagen content (p less than 0.02) after preoperative irradiation. This effect was mitigated by dietary vitamin A supplementation.\r"

In 23 patients, at a mean of 24 months postoperatively (range 22 to 26 months), ileal pouch motility was measured using an intraluminal bag and pressure-sensitive catheters. The pattern and efficiency of ileal pouch emptying was determined scintigraphically. A 24 hour stool collection was made and the stool output and stool frequency recorded. The volume of ileal pouch distention at which large amplitude propulsive waves appeared (the threshold volume) correlated closely with stool frequency. The larger the threshold volume, the fewer the stools per 24 hours (correlation coefficient -0.70; p less than 0.01). Also, the greater the 24 hour stool output, the greater the stool frequency (correlation coefficient 0.79, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the efficiency of ileal pouch evacuation was less strongly related to stool frequency (correlation coefficient -0.41, p = 0.05). We conclude that ileal pouch motility and stool output are major determinants of stool frequency after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Inefficient pouch emptying is less commonly associated with frequent bowel movements.\r"

Over a 10 year period, 33 patients were operated on and found to have a duct of Wirsung entering the duodenum through the fibers of the sphincter of Oddi. Recurrent pancreatitis of sufficient intensity to require hospitalization had occurred an average of 4.2 times per patient, and each had experienced numerous episodes of abdominal pain of lesser severity. At least two attacks of pancreatitis that required hospitalization had occurred in all patients. All known causes of pancreatitis, including alcoholism, gallstones, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, drug reactions, and pancreas divisum were excluded. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed no ductal abnormalities. Twenty-eight of the patients had previously undergone cholecystectomy 8 months to 20 years before operation. A sphinteroplasty of the common bile duct and duct of Wirsung resulted in elimination of attacks of pancreatitis in all except two patients. Follow-up has been more than 5 years in 16 patients, more than 4 years in 10 patients, and more than 1 year in 5 patients. There have been no deaths. It appears that the entrance of the duct of Wirsung into the duodenum through a separate orifice through the fibers of the sphincter of Oddi causes recurrent acute pancreatitis. It seems likely that the problem is one of intermittent pancreatic duct obstruction. Normal pancreatic duct caliber is attributed to the intermittent nature of the obstruction. Enlargement of the orifice of the duct of Wirsung and division of the sphincter of Oddi relieved attacks of recurrent pancreatitis.\r"

In experiments on 14 dogs, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery blood flow was maintained at 50 percent of normal flow by occluders and flow probes, and tonometers were placed in the stomach and small bowel to measure intramural pH, a metabolic marker of intestinal perfusion. Intramural pH was determined at 100 percent and 50 percent splanchnic blood flow, at 50 percent flow after instillation of cream into the stomach, and again when cream was placed into the small bowel. Intestinal intramural pH decreased significantly when blood flow was decreased to 50 percent, as expected, but decreased significantly again when cream was placed in the stomach. The hemodynamic explanation of the decrease when cream was placed in the stomach is a steal from the intestinal to the gastric circulation stimulated by food in the stomach. Such a steal could explain the temporal nature of the pain experienced by patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.\r"

The cancers invaded to the muscularis mucosae in 2 patients (1 with aneuploid disease and 1 with diploid disease), into the submucosa in 15 patients (7 with aneuploid disease and 8 with diploid disease), and the muscularis propria in 13 patients (8 with aneuploid disease and 5 with diploid disease).

Six of these seven (86 percent) had aneuploid disease. The aggressive clinical behavior of the tumors with aneuploid DNA content was not otherwise predictable by standard histologic features. Aggressive tumor behavior appears to correlate closely with aneuploidy in locally treated rectal cancers, as opposed to a lack of correlation in our patients treated with major resection. The fact that these cancers are being treated by local excision may allow the prognostic impact of DNA content to reflect the natural history of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the determinants of morbidity and mortality after hepatic lobectomy, we studied 17 potential risk factors in 58 consecutive patients who had right hepatic lobectomy (39 patients), left hepatic lobectomy (10 patients), extended right hepatic lobectomy (6 patients), and left lateral segmentectomy (3 patients). The lesions were benign neoplasm (11 patients), primary malignancy (12 patients), metastatic neoplasm (28 patients), and inflammatory conditions, namely, stones, ductal strictures, and abscess (7 patients). Two patients died (3.8 percent), one from operative hemorrhage and the other from sepsis. Major complications occurred in 29 patients (50 percent). The presence of diabetes or pulmonary disease correlated with the development of complications. Infection occurred in four of five patients with diabetes. The incision was extended into the thorax in nine patients, all of whom had complications. The mean weight of the resected specimen did not differ between patients who underwent thoracotomy and those who did not, but the two largest specimens (over 2 kg) were removed without thoracotomy. Minor complications developed in two patients with benign tumors. Biliary fistulas developed in three of seven patients with inflammatory conditions. Infectious complications were decreased in the presence of adequate perioperative antibiotics and closed drainage of the subphrenic space. These data show that in fit patients, elective liver resection can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality; diabetes, pulmonary disease, and inflammatory lesions increase the risk of hepatic resections; adequate antibiotics and closed drainage decrease the risk of infection; and thoracotomy markedly increases the chance of complications. Finally, since elective resection can nearly always be performed without thoracotomy, it should be avoided in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "During a 10 year period, 69 patients with pancreatic duct dilation of 7 mm or more and intractable pain from chronic pancreatitis underwent Roux-Y drainage either as a lateral pancreatojejunostomy on 48 occasions or as a caudal pancreatojejunostomy in 21 cases. Nine patients (three with caudal pancreatojejunostomy and six with lateral pancreatojejunostomy) were lost to follow-up within the first postoperative year. The residual 60 patients undergoing 64 procedures were followed for an average of 69.3 months (range 10 to 144 months). Four patients with recurrent pain after caudal pancreatojejunostomy were converted to a lateral pancreatojejunostomy, with resolution of pain. Long-term pain relief occurred significantly more often in patients undergoing lateral pancreatojejunostomy than in those who received a caudal pancreatojejunostomy (66 versus 34 percent, p less than 0.01). Accordingly, caudal pancreatojejunostomy has little place in the surgical management of these patients. Since no differences existed in the two surgical populations, long-term pain relief in chronic pancreatitis appears more favorably influenced by the choice of an appropriate surgical procedure, rather than resulting solely from progressive destruction of the gland, as has been claimed. Although successful results in patients with lateral pancreatojejunostomy could not be correlated with anastomotic suture technique (one layer versus two layers or capsule versus mucosa-to-mucosa, p greater than 0.05), the creation of a pancreatojejunal anastomosis of more than 6 cm was found to be critical for success (p less than 0.001). Restoration of either exocrine or endocrine function should not be anticipated after otherwise successful lateral pancreatojejunostomy. However, if ductal dilatation can be demonstrated, recurrent pain after lateral pancreatojejunostomy is best managed by repeat lateral pancreatojejunostomy rather than resection.\r"

  ".U": "87125525\r", 
  ".W": "During a 4 year period, we found no objective evidence that parietal cell vagotomy contributes to the production of gastroesophageal reflux. The fact that patients without reflux preoperatively achieved the same satisfactory clinical results whether parietal cell vagotomy was or was not accompanied by an antireflux procedure supports this view. Therefore, in the absence of reflux, we cannot recommend the prophylactic use of an antireflux procedure in combination with parietal cell vagotomy in the treatment of patients with duodenal ulcer. On the other hand, patients with duodenal ulcer should be evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux before operation because it is desirable to combine parietal cell vagotomy with an antireflux procedure if both conditions exist. Patients who have mild reflux preoperatively but no symptoms of reflux after parietal cell vagotomy alone, as in three of the four patients in Group IV, may have such symptoms subsequently. Therefore, we think that the combined procedure does not increase the morbidity over that of parietal cell vagotomy alone and recommend the combination of parietal cell vagotomy and an antireflux procedure for any patient undergoing operation for duodenal ulcer who also demonstrates an abnormal degree of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

This difference was not statistically significant. No patient died as a consequence of their wound infection, and no intraabdominal infections occurred. Our data suggest that the risk for development of a wound infection after a staging laparotomy for Hodgkin's disease is increased by performing an incidental appendectomy as part of the procedure. Although the differences noted were not statistically significant, this was probably due to the sample size. Based on our data, we do not routinely remove the appendix at the time of staging laparotomy.\r"

Two illustrative case histories are presented.

Limited sensory blockade was achieved in the groups with 40 ml 0.5% and 20 ml 1% during the 30-minute test period. One subject was not fully anaesthetised with any of the dosages used. Recovery was rapid (mean 12-13 minutes) in these two groups. In two subjects given 40 ml of 1%, complete recovery took 90 minutes. At 30 minutes, the degree of flexion remaining in the great toe (control 100%) was 4% in the groups who received 40 ml of 0.5% and 1%, but 34% in those who received 20 ml of 1% respectively. Full motor recovery was achieved in 8-9 minutes. Five of six volunteers who received the 400-mg dose experienced subjective signs of central nervous system side effects when the cuff was released. In this group, the mean plasma level of prilocaine at 2 minutes was 1.22 micrograms/ml, maximum 2.12 micrograms/ml. In a radiological examination, no leak of contrast medium under the tourniquet cuff (300 mmHg) was detected. The development of anaesthesia was fastest following the largest dose, but the large number of central side effects makes that dosage less suitable for clinical work.\r"

Patients received 20 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate orally immediately prior to induction of anaesthesia. The combination of ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate produced marked alkalinisation of gastric contents (mean pH 8.9). The administration of sodium bicarbonate pre-operatively in patients who received ranitidine less than 2 hours before operation led to satisfactory elevation of gastric pH. Only four patients had a gastric pH less than 2.5, one patient refused any medication, two received only ranitidine and one patient had a long interval from administration of bicarbonate to aspiration of gastric contents. Gastric volumes were high in labouring patients (mean 84 ml) despite administration of ranitidine. The effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate as a single dose antacid therapy prior to obstetric anaesthesia requires further study.\r"

Severity of pain was assessed before and after treatment by subjective pain scores and visual analogue scales. Neither of these methods showed a significant difference between the treatments. Nalbuphine was associated with less maternal nausea and vomiting than pethidine, but this possible advantage was somewhat offset by a tendency of the drug to produce more maternal sedation and dizziness. The mean umbilical vein/maternal vein ratio was significantly higher for nalbuphine (0.78, SEM 0.03) than for pethidine (0.61, SEM 0.02), which suggests easier placental transfer of the former. This finding was reflected in significantly lower 2-4 hour neurobehavioural scores for the infants of mothers given nalbuphine, but there was no significant difference between these scores at 24 hours. On the basis of this study, nalbuphine does not offer a substantial improvement over pethidine for pain relief in labour.\r"

Eight dogs, instrumented with pressure and ultrasonic dimension transducers for assessment of left ventricular (LV) performance, were given both NP and ATP. Regional blood flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. After 20 min of infusion, both drugs decreased systemic arterial pressure by 36% with minimal changes in cardiac index (CI), LV end-diastolic pressure, or heart rate. However, hypotension produced by ATP was associated with a greater CI (3.84 +/- 0.32 vs 2.97 +/- 0.35 L X min-1 X m-2) than was NP and also associated with a further decrease in systemic vascular resistance (14.4 +/- 1.4 vs 17.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg X L-1 X min X m2). Left ventricular global function, measured by the slope of the linear regression line of the LV end-systolic pressure-diameter relation (Ees), did not change significantly after either drug. Blood flow to the coronary bed was significantly greater with ATP than with NP (231.6 +/- 30.6 vs 81.7 +/- 6.1 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1). Except for an increase in hepatic arterial blood flow with NP, neither ATP nor NP significantly altered blood flow to the brain, spinal cord, spleen, kidney, jejunum, muscle, and skin. Controlled hypotension by ATP was stable and rapidly reversible without rebound hypertension. The results of this study indicate that ATP is a rapidly acting, effective hypotensive agent that compares favorably with NP.\r"

Monitoring of the diaphragm consisted of measurement of the transdiaphragmatic pressure after bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. Onset time for neuromuscular blockade of the diaphragm was 1.6 +/- 0.3 min (+/-SD) compared to 2.5 +/- 0.3 min in the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.001). The diaphragm recovered earlier and more rapidly than the adductor pollicis. The twitch height (TH) returned to 25% of its control value after 27 +/- 8 min for the diaphragm, compared to 41 +/- 11 min for the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.01). Complete TH recovery was achieved after 49 +/- 14 min for the diaphragm and after 74 +/- 22 min for the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.01). The recovery index of 12 +/- 4 min for the diaphragm was significantly shorter (P less than 0.05) than for the adductor pollicis (20 +/- 9 min.) We conclude that monitoring of peripheral muscles in anesthetized patients given vecuronium provides adequate information about the degree of paralysis of the diaphragm.\r"

After a control period in HEPES-Liley solution, the isolated nerves were exposed to bupivacaine concentrations of 0.1 mM to 1.0 mM. After 30 min exposure, the nerves were stimulated supramaximally and the percent reduction in amplitude of A, B, and C fiber compound action potentials was recorded. Linear regressions were fitted by the least squares method. The A fiber conduction blockade was consistently greater in the nerves from pregnant rabbits (P less than 0.001). The slope of the C fiber dose-response curves was also significantly greater in nerves from pregnant rabbits (P less than 0.01). The results indicate that the response of isolated nerves from pregnant animals to local anesthetic-induced conduction blockade differs from that of nerves from nonpregnant animals. However, it is not certain whether the difference is related simply to a more rapid diffusion and shorter onset of block or an enhanced sensitivity of the nerve membrane during pregnancy.\r"

Another 40 patients, selected at random to receive 3 ml of either hyperbaric or isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%, were then studied. Levels of pin-prick analgesia and motor block were tested during induction, surgery, and recovery. The effects of high spinal anesthesia on peak expiratory flow (PEF) and arterial blood gas tensions were also examined in the last 40 patients. With isobaric bupivacaine, persons with higher than normal BMI [body mass index = weight (kg) divided by height-squared (m2)], or persons who were shorter than normal had higher cephalad spread of anesthesia. With hyperbaric bupivacaine only shorter individuals developed higher levels of anesthesia. Because of considerable interindividual variability, however, these observations are of only limited clinical value in predicting the spread of bupivacaine spinal analgesia. The higher spread of analgesia was associated with a decrease in PEF, whereas, the blood gas tensions remained undisturbed.\r"

The purpose of the present clinical study was to determine the relationship between age and sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside in 16 patients during deliberate hypotensive anesthesia by determining the blood pressure changes in young and elderly patients to incremental increases in dose of sodium nitroprusside. A dose-response curve relating change in mean blood pressure to dose of sodium nitroprusside (microgram X kg-1 X min-1) was constructed for each patient; the slope of this line is a measure of \"sensitivity.\" The change in mean arterial blood pressure per microgram X kg-1 X min-1 nitroprusside dose (i.e., slope), showed a significant correlation with age (r = 0.766, P less than 0.001), demonstrating that sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside increases with advancing years. The maximum change in heart rate produced by nitroprusside showed a reciprocal correlation with age (r = -0.791, P less than 0.001). There was no significant correlation between age and maximum change in plasma norepinephrine or epinephrine concentrations during nitroprusside infusion. The increased sensitivity to nitroprusside might have been due to diminished baroreflex activity, resistance of cardiac adrenergic receptors to catecholamine stimulation, or alteration in sensitivity to the direct vasodilating effects of sodium nitroprusside. Whatever the mechanism, however, this clinical study has shown that lower doses of nitroprusside should be used in elderly patients to achieve the same degree of hypotension achieved in younger patients.\r"

For 29 (64%) of the cases, at least three members concluded that nonanesthetic causes (e.g., hypoxia, sepsis, viral infection) explained the hepatic injury. For 16 cases (36%), two or more members concluded that isoflurane might be one of several possible causes of the hepatic injury. In the latter cases, patients tended to be younger, had undergone anesthesia of shorter duration for operations outside the chest and abdomen, had developed symptoms later, had higher plasma transaminase values but lower bilirubin values, and had a lower incidence of eosinophilia, anemia, transfusions, and congestive heart failure. The committee concluded that current evidence does not indicate a reasonable likelihood of an association between the use of isoflurane and the occurrence of postoperative hepatic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of resuscitation with hypertonic saline on extravascular lung water, seven adult sheep were endotracheally intubated; mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. A 5-French, thermistor-tipped catheter was used to measure extravascular lung water (EVLW). Colloid oncotic pressure (COP), serum electrolytes and osmolality, and arterial and mixed venous blood gas tensions were measured. The COP-PCWP gradient and the shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt) were calculated. After baseline measurements, the animals were bled to an MAP of 50 mm Hg (blood volume removed, 16.2 +/- 3.6 ml/kg), which was maintained for 30 min, measurements then being repeated. Three percent sodium chloride solution was infused at 500 ml/15 min until two of three parameters--cardiac output (CO), PCWP, or MAP--were restored to baseline values. Data were recorded again and then 60 min later. No shed blood was reinfused. The total volume of hypertonic saline infused was 39 +/- 19 ml/kg. Pulmonary artery pressure did not vary throughout the study. PCWP, MAP, and CO were significantly lower than baseline (P less than 0.05) 30 min after bleeding but all except MAP returned to baseline with resuscitation. Throughout the study, EVLW did not vary despite a COP-PCWP gradient less than 4 mm Hg. Serum sodium levels and serum osmolality were significantly above baseline values after resuscitation. In this animal model of hemorrhagic shock, infusion of hypertonic saline effected resuscitation without compromising cardiopulmonary function or increasing EVLW.\r"

  ".W": "The protonation equilibrium and hydrophobic character of lidocaine were characterized by its pKa and the octanol:buffer partition coefficients of the charged (P+) and neutral (Po) drug species. These measurements were accomplished by ultraviolet spectrophotometry of pure lidocaine HCl solutions at different temperatures, ionic strengths, and buffer concentrations. Corroboration of the pKa determination by the potentiometric method and of the partition coefficients by gas chromatography validated the general application of the spectrophotometric technique. The pKa increased with decreasing temperature (7.61 +/- 0.06 at 36 degrees C; 7.94 +/- 0.04 at 26 degrees C, in water; mean +/- SD), increasing ionic strength (8.06 +/- 0.02 at 26 degrees C in 0.165 M NaCl) and increasing buffer capacity (8.28 +/- 0.06 at 25 degrees C in 0.15 M NaCl + 20 mM buffer). Octanol:buffer partition coefficients for both the protonated and the neutral species (expressed as mole fractions) increased upon warning: 0.55 +/- 0.04 and 2666 +/- 202, respectively, at 25 degrees C, and 0.75 +/- 0.09 and 3210 +/- 272, respectively, at 36 degrees C. Ionic strength and buffer concentration had no significant effect on either P value. The increase in pKa at lower temperatures coupled with the decreased partition coefficients resulted in a nearly constant concentration of the protonated species in octanol as the system was cooled, whereas the concentration of the neutral species fell by more than 80%. This finding may explain the large increase in the impulse blocking potency of lidocaine observed upon nerve cooling, if the protonated anesthetic species is the more active form of the drug competing with the neutral species for a common binding site.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the heart rate (HR) response to enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane and the effects of narcotics on this response in 81 healthy patients scheduled for elective surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: one of the three anesthetics (approximately 0.9 MAC) in 60% nitrous oxide, and either 0.15 mg/kg of intramuscular morphine 30-60 min before induction or 1 microgram/kg of IV fentanyl 10 min after skin incision. All patients received diazepam, 10 mg orally, 60-90 min before anesthesia, a rapid sequence intravenous induction, and mechanically controlled ventilation. During inhalational anesthesia and the first 10 min of surgery, no significant change in HR occurred in any group (compared to the preinduction HR), although patients given morphine premedication tended to have a decreased HR and those not given morphine premedication tended to have an increased HR. These trends partially account for significant differences that emerged between groups after induction of anesthesia. Patients given morphine premedication and halothane had lower HR (64 +/- 3 SEM) than patients given isoflurane (80 +/- 3) or enflurane (84 +/- 3) and no morphine premedication. Patients anesthetized with enflurane and morphine premedication had lower HR (71 +/- 3) than patients given enflurane without morphine premedication. Administration of fentanyl 10 min after incision (these patients had received no morphine) significantly decreased HR in the presence of any of the vapors. We conclude that inhalational anesthetics used in the clinical setting we employed do not significantly increase heart rate, and that prior administration of morphine or concurrent administration of fentanyl may significantly decrease HR.\r"

Patients in group 3 received bupivacaine 0.5% in 8% glucose and were placed in the supine horizontal position immediately after injection. Observations of patients in group 3 were observer blind and in groups 1 and 2 double blind. The differences between segmental levels of sensory and temperature loss between groups 1 and 2 and between groups 2 and 3 were statistically not significant. Motor blockade of the lower extremities was more intense in the patients who were kept sitting for 3 min (groups 1 and 2). It is concluded that both solutions are equally suitable for spinal anesthesia, provided patients receiving the plain solution are kept sitting for at least 2 min. When using hyperbaric bupivacaine, posture seems to have no influence on cephalad spread.\r"

Special attention was paid to the ease with which the space opened up and also to the extent of view achieved. In ten cases the space opened up with ease, in four cases with difficulty, and in one case it was not possible to establish the subdural space at all. The bevel of an 18-gauge Tuohy needle introduced into the subdural space could be visualized in eight of 13 cases. An epidural catheter was then passed through the Tuohy needle into the subdural space in eight cases and was visualized in six of them. Although care must be exercised in drawing conclusions for clinical epidural anesthesia from autopsy cases, this study confirms the possibility of placing both the bevel of a Tuohy needle and an epidural catheter in the subdural space. The results reemphasize the need for caution suggested by other reports regarding the possibility of subdural puncture in epidural anesthesia and subsequent injection of anesthetic solution into the subdural space.\r"

Diltiazem at a plasma concentration of 282 +/- 33 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in coronary blood flows, and decreases in coronary and systemic vascular resistances with only little effect on global and regional RV and LV function. However, the PR interval increased by 40%, and three animals developed II degrees atrioventricular block type I. At stable diltiazem plasma levels, administration of isoflurane caused dose-dependent decreases in myocardial segment shortening and stroke volume with unchanged LV or increased RV preload, and little changed RV or reduced LV afterload indicating myocardial depression. Coronary and systemic vascular resistances remained unaffected. At the higher concentration of isoflurane (mean inspired 1.3 +/- 0.2%), seven animals developed intermittent sinus node arrests with pauses up to 12 s followed by intermittent junctional escape or sinus rhythms. Similar interactions might develop in patients on diltiazem receiving isoflurane.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous infusions of verapamil and diltiazem were established in halothane-anesthetized dogs (1.15-1.35% end tidal concentration) with or without a concomitant propranolol infusion to investigate changes: in cardiovascular function, in reflex activation as reflected in circulating catecholamine levels, and in the chronotropic response to the exogenously administered beta agonist, isoproterenol. Verapamil plasma levels of approximately 100 and 250 ng X ml-1, diltiazem plasma levels of approximately 140 and 325 ng X ml-1, and propranolol levels of approximately 70 ng X ml-1 were tolerated individually in the presence of halothane, although atrioventricular conduction was prolonged in the verapamil and diltiazem groups. Catecholamine levels were increased in the high verapamil group. However, when propranolol was combined with the lower levels of verapamil or diltiazem, the result was decreased heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular maximum rate of tension development (dP/dt), and cardiac index with increased systemic vascular resistance. When the attempt was made to proceed to the increased plasma levels of verapamil or diltiazem in the presence of propranolol, 6/6 animals in the verapamil-propranolol group and 4/6 animals in the diltiazem-propranolol group were unable to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of greater than 50 mmHg, and many developed 2 degrees or higher heart block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sufentanil (mean total dose 2 micrograms/kg) was compared with fentanyl (mean total dose 15 micrograms/kg) as a supplement to 60% N2O anesthesia in 30 adult patients undergoing general surgical procedures. Comparisons were made with respect to stability of hemodynamic variables (heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure), changes in stress hormones (cortisol, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine), recovery of alertness and orientation, time to extubation, postoperative analgesia, and measures of respiratory depression (resting end-tidal carbon dioxide tension [PETCO2], CO2 response curve for minute ventilation [delta VE/delta PETCO2]). Hemodynamic variables remained stable and similar in both groups throughout the study. Plasma hormone levels remained similar to baseline in both groups until 1 h postoperatively when epinephrine levels were significantly elevated in both groups (P less than 0.05). Recovery times, including time to extubation, were similar in both groups. Patients given sufentanil had less pain 30 min postoperatively than those given fentanyl, although at 60 min postoperatively pain levels were similar in both groups. Small but significant elevations in resting PETCO2 were seen in both groups postoperatively (P less than 0.05), but postoperative delta VE/delta PETCO2 responses were significantly depressed only in patients receiving fentanyl (P less than 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that sufentanil-N2O anesthesia is as effective as fentanyl-N2O in attenuating the hemodynamic and hormonal responses to the stress of general surgery. Because continuous intraoperative PETCO2 monitoring was not employed in this study, intraoperative hypocapnea cannot be strictly excluded as a possible influence on the postoperative measures of ventilatory drive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clearance in the newborns is less than one-half that found in older infants (6.3 vs. 23.8 ml X min-1 X kg-1). The combination of lower clearance and longer elimination half-life in newborns (0-7 days) may well explain a prolonged duration of action for morphine in very young infants, but other etiologies are needed to explain the respiratory sensitivity believed to persist in older infants.\r"

Measurements were taken with the animals awake and during steady-state low and high concentrations of halothane (1.2%, 2.4%), enflurane (2.4%, 4.0%), and isoflurane (1.6%, 3.0%) with and without at least 2 weeks of oral verapamil, 120 mg, three times per day. Plasma verapamil levels varied widely, with means of 500-700 ng X ml-1 in awake animals and lower (300-400 ng X ml-1) at the time of hemodynamic measurements during anesthesia. Chronic oral verapamil in awake dogs produced predominantly tachycardia. The hemodynamic effects of low-dose halothane and isoflurane before and after oral verapamil were unchanged except for decreased renal blood flow after oral verapamil and no coronary vasodilation nor tachycardia. However, left atrial pressure was increased and cardiac output and coronary blood flow were decreased by low concentrations of enflurane with oral verapamil compared to without. The combination of oral verapamil with low (clinical) doses of enflurane was more depressant to the cardiovascular system of healthy dogs than was the combination of verapamil and halothane or isoflurane.\r"

Eight subjects were studied wearing an inflatable mask, sealed with surgical lubricant. They showed a mean +/- SD 3.5 +/- 6.4% FRC decrease (no significance). Six subjects studied via mouthpiece awake and via endotracheal tube during anesthesia showed a mean 22 +/- 19% reduction in FRC, significantly greater than face mask studies (P less than 0.05). The greatest FRC decrease occurred in subjects with repetitive or protracted coughing after intubation. The serum methohexital level was 6.6 +/- 3.6 micrograms/ml for intubated patients, and 6.0 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml in those with face mask (no significance). The depth of anesthesia was sufficient to produce a 50% reduction in ventilatory response to CO2 rebreathing, from 15.8 to 8.7 l/min/% CO2. Respitrace plethysmography indicated a 38 +/- 12% ribcage contribution to tidal volume during quiet breathing, which increased to 47 +/- 14% with CO2 breathing (end-tidal FCO2 9-10%). There was no dimunition of ribcage contribution during anesthesia in either group, irrespective of CO2 concentration. The authors interpret their findings to indicate that iv methohexital anesthesia does not produce FRC reduction, in contrast to an inhaled anesthetic such as halothane. It is proposed that this difference may be related to maintenance of coordinated ribcage/diaphragm muscle activity, because ribcage activity is markedly suppressed by halothane. In addition, it is proposed that FRC reduction in intubated subjects was the result of a confounding variable, namely coughing in response to the endotracheal tube.\r"

  ".W": "Lung densities (atelectasis) and pulmonary gas exchange were studied in 13 supine patients with no apparent lung disease, the former by transverse computerized tomography (CT) and the latter by a multiple inert gas elimination technique for assessment of the distribution of ventilation/perfusion ratios. In the awake state no patient had clear signs of atelectasis on the CT scan. Lung ventilation and perfusion were well matched in most of the patients. Three patients had shunts corresponding to 2-5% of cardiac output, and in one patient there was low perfusion of poorly ventilated regions. CT scans after 15 min of halothane anesthesia and mechanical ventilation showed densities in dependent lung regions in 11 patients. A shunt was present in all patients, ranging from 1% in two patients (unchanged from the awake state) to 17%. Ventilation of poorly perfused regions was noted in nine patients, ranging from 1-19% of total ventilation. The magnitude of the shunt significantly correlated to the size of dependent densities (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001). Five patients studied during spontaneous breathing under anesthesia displayed both densities in dependent regions and a shunt, although of fairly small magnitude (1.8% and 3.7%, respectively). Both the density area and the shunt increased after muscle paralysis. PEEP reduced the density area in all patients but did not consistently alter the shunt. It is concluded that the development of atelectasis in dependent lung regions is a major cause of gas exchange impairment during halothane anesthesia, during both spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, and that PEEP diminishes the atelectasis, but not necessarily the shunt.\r"

Simultaneous recording of the activity of the neurons of the NTS and the phrenic nerve was done to identify the inspiratory neurons. Cells whose firing activity was synchronous with that of the phrenic nerve were considered inspiratory neurons. Administration of 1% and 1.5% halothane in oxygen induced a dose-dependent depression of the cell activity (spikes/s) with the cervical vagi intact or severed. Five and ten minutes after inhalation of 1% halothane, the cell activity (mean +/- SE) expressed as per cent of the control was 55.3 +/- 9 and 27 +/- 7, respectively (P less than 0.001), before bilateral cervical vagotomy. The corresponding values for 1.5% halothane were 25 +/- 10.1 and 5.6 +/- 3, respectively. Upon termination of halothane administration, the cell activity gradually returned toward the control level. The cell response to halothane was not affected by bilateral cervical vagotomy. Hypercapnia produced by inhalation of 5% CO2 increased the cell activity, but halothane caused profound depression of the cells even in the presence of hypercapnia. Based on these results, it may be concluded that: halothane has inhibitory effects on the activity of the inspiratory neurons of the NTS; and halothane-induced respiratory depression has a central component and that the NTS may serve as a site of action of halothane for its respiratory depressant effect.\r"

  ".W": "Because it has been suggested that histamine H2-receptor antagonists may worsen airway constriction in asthmatic patients, we investigated the comparative effects of three histamine H2-receptor antagonists on guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle in vitro. When tested against resting tone, cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine produced dose-related relaxation with pD2 values (negative log of ED50 for relaxation) (+/- SE, n; eq 5) of 3.20 +/- 0.04, 2.95 +/- 0.16 and 2.97 +/- 0.14, respectively. Concentrations that were below threshold for relaxation, did not elicit contraction. However, when the preparations were precontracted with histamine (10(-5)M), dose-response curves for relaxation were shifted to the right, and low-concentrations of all three histamine H2-antagonists augmented histamine-induced tone. When preparations were pretreated with cimetidine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) and then tested for sensitivity to histamine, dose-response curves for histamine-induced contraction were shifted to the left (potentiated). These results provide further evidence for a modulatory effect of airway H2-receptors on the contractile response to histamine. In addition, since the concentrations associated with potentiation of histamine-induced contraction were about the same for all three H2-receptor antagonists (greater than or equal to 10(-5) M), our studies suggest a greater likelihood of airway constriction for the less potent H2-receptor antagonists that must be administered in higher clinical doses.\r"

  ".W": "The experiments examined the characteristics of analgesia produced by different doses of morphine, meperidine (pethidine), fentanyl, and sufentanil after epidural and subcutaneous injection in rats. The specificity of the analgesia was also determined; other in vivo pharmacologic activities (i.e., blockade of pinna and cornea reflexes and production of skeletal muscle rigidity) were monitored as pharmacologic indices of opiate drug activity in the brain. After subcutaneous injection, the opiates produced dose-dependent analgesia, blocked the pinna and cornea reflexes, and induced muscle rigidity. After epidural injection, all four compounds produced dose-dependent analgesia and had greater potency, earlier onset, shorter duration, and greater specificity of analgesic action than was the case after subcutaneous injection. Specificity is defined here as the ratio of the ED50 dose that blocked the pinna reflex to the ED50 dose that produced analgesia. The gains in potency and specificity, but not the gains in onset time and the losses in duration of analgesia, differed considerably among the compounds that were examined. The subcutaneous-to-epidural potency ratio related in a linear manner with the lipid-to-water partition coefficient. The gain in specificity also appeared to be related to lipid solubility. The microgram X kg-1 doses at which the opiates produced analgesia in rats correlate well with the potency of these compounds in producing analgesia after epidural injection in humans. The rat epidural preparation reflected the doses, onset, and specificity, but not the duration, of analgesia produced by epidural opiates in humans.\r"

Total nerve activity was recorded continuously, and its change was related to drug concentration. The half-time of recovery following drug wash-out was also determined. At pH 7.4, the minimal blocking concentration was 0.5 X 10(-3) mol/l for procaine and 0.05 X 10(-3) mol/l for bupivacaine, the half-times of recovery 1.4 and 3.0 min, respectively. Procaine and bupivacaine reversibly blocked natural spike activity at the same concentrations as they blocked electrically evoked activity. The aortic nerve, whose physiologic spike traffic can be followed continuously for hours, may be used to advantage for studying the long-term effects of local anesthetics in vivo.\r"

This pacemaker system uses a conventional transvenous ventricular electrode, which senses the evoked QT interval after a ventricular paced beat, as an indicator of physiological metabolic demand. Implantation of the TX pacemaker does not differ from that of conventional VVI units, and two special modes are available after implantation: TX and VVI mode. Bicycle ergometer tests showed that significantly higher rate response and exercise ability were achieved during the TX mode compared with the VVI mode (mean maximal heart rate: 115 +/- 13 bpm vs 96 +/- 21 bpm, p less than 0.01, and mean maximal exercise time; 10.7 +/- 3.9 min vs 8.0 +/- 3.8 min, p less than 0.01, respectively). In one patient, cardiac index was measured by a thermodilution method during the bicycle ergometer test, which confirmed that an adequate increase in cardiac index (rest: 3.38 liters/min/m2, vs exercise; 7.34 liters/min/m2) was obtained by an increase of the pacing rate (rest: 72 bpm vs exercise: 128 bpm). Our results show that physiological rate-responsive pacing using the QT interval provides a simple means of increasing the heart rate and cardiac index.\r"

  ".U": "87125959\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, data has become available to support the concept that a selective lengthening of the cardiac action potential (a Class III antiarrhythmic action) by whatever mechanism with an attendant increase in the effective refractory period constitutes a distinct antiarrhythmic mechanism. Such an action is exemplified clinically by hypocalemia and hypothyroidism and pharmacologically by amiodarone, sotalol and bretylium, all of which have other associated features. The N-acetylation of procainamide leads to the pharmacologically active compound, N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA). The loss of propensity to block depolarization with the preservation of the effect on repolarization in the case of NAPA makes the compound a class III antiarrhythmic agent. The process of N-acetylation has also led to longer elimination half-life and predominantly renal excretion with linear kinetics but with the preservation of the antiarrhythmic properties of the parent compound. The electrophysiologic data are consistent with the results of studies which have demonstrated that NAPA has the potential to suppress premature ventricular contractions and prevent spontaneously occurring as well inducible ventricular tachycardia in patients with heart disease. The effects on atria indicate that the drug has the potential to electively reverse atrial flutter and fibrillation to normal rhythm and maintain stability of sinus rhythm. The overall experimental and clinical data warrant further evaluation of NAPA as an antiarrhythmic agent.\r"

  ".U": "87125960\r", 
  ".W": "The inotropic actions of N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) were studied in chloralose-urethane anesthetized dogs. Myocardial contractile force was measured with a Walton-Brodie strain gauge sutured to the right ventricle. A low-dose NAPA infusion (12 mg/kg i.v.) increased myocardial force by a maximum of 11.6 +/- 2.4% (mean +/- SEM), whereas a high dose of NAPA (60 mg/kg i.v.) increased myocardial force by 33.3 +/- 2.6% at the peak of the effect. The high-dose NAPA infusion also caused significant reductions in heart rate and blood pressure, while the low-dose NAPA infusion lacked significant chronotropic or hypotensive actions. Pretreatment with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v. loading, followed by a 10 micrograms/kg/min infusion) did not block the positive inotropic actions of NAPA 12 mg/kg, but these actions were blocked in dogs pretreated with both propranolol and atropine (1 mg/kg). On the other hand, pretreatment with propranolol blocked and reversed the inotropic actions of NAPA 60 mg/kg, and potentiated its negative chronotropic effects. Thus, the positive inotropic actions of NAPA are indirect and more than one mechanism is involved; a component due to direct action related to the lengthening of cardiac repolarization is not discounted. At low doses, the increase in myocardial force seems related to NAPA's vagolytic properties, whereas at high doses the positive inotropic actions appear to be catecholamine-mediated. Furthermore, a negative inotropic action of high-dose NAPA is apparent after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.\r"

The hemodynamic profile of NAPA is compared to and contrasted with other antiarrhythmic drugs, many of which exert significant depressant effects on left ventricular function. The hemodynamic profile of NAPA is favorable for an antiarrhythmic agent but further data are necessary to define its effects in patients with severely depressed myocardial performance.\r"

  ".W": "Shortly after Dreyfus and his colleagues demonstrated that procainamide was metabolized by acetylation to N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), Drayer, Reidenberg and Sevy reported that NAPA had antiarrhythmic activity in an animal model. We confirmed these findings and found that plasma levels of NAPA were high enough to warrant consideration in managing patients requiring procainamide therapy. However, the actual impetus for developing NAPA as an antiarrhythmic drug in its own right was provided by the initial studies of NAPA pharmacokinetics in normal subjects. In these studies, we showed that NAPA has an elimination-phase half-life that is more than twice as long as procainamide and suggested that patient compliance and arrhythmia suppression might be improved if NAPA were used to circumvent the inconvenience of the frequent dosing schedule that has been recommended for procainamide. From the standpoint of managing individual patients with NAPA, the pharmacokinetics of this drug continue to provide the scientific basis for designing dose regimens that will have maximal antiarrhythmic efficacy and minimal toxicity. This review summarizes the salient features of NAPA pharmacokinetics and outlines an approach for individualizing therapy with this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic properties of N-acetylprocainamide, an active metabolite of procainamide, were studied in 15 patients who presented with a cardiac arrest or documented sustained ventricular tachycardia. Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed. All patients tested had inducible ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation techniques while off all antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients were then tested on procainamide 1000 mg administered intravenously, and ventricular tachycardia could be provoked in 8 of 10 patients. Twenty-four to 36 hours later, N-acetylprocainamide was administered, intravenously, and programmed stimulation was performed after 20 minutes. N-acetylprocainamide did not significantly change heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, electrocardiographic intervals, A-H or H-V conduction times. N-acetylprocainamide prevented ventricular tachycardia induction in 6 of 15 patients. The mean serum N-acetylprocainamide levels in the group protected was 15.7 +/- 4 micrograms/ml and 16.2 +/- 4 micrograms/ml in the group not protected. These 6 patients were discharged on N-acetylprocainamide 1.5 grams orally every 8 hours. Three patients have been maintained on chronic N-acetylprocainamide every 8 hours. Three patients have been maintained on chronic N-acetylprocainamide therapy (6 +/- 2 months), two patients had breakthrough ventricular tachycardia on follow-up Holter monitoring and alternative therapy was given. N-acetylprocainamide has antiarrhythmic efficacy in preventing induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation in a high risk group of patients. On chronic oral therapy, N-acetylprocainamide appears to be well tolerated with antiarrhythmic efficacy that may be enhanced with further upward dose titration.\r"

Each Pt-wire has a hemispheric collecting area of about 30 microns. Pressure ischemia by compression of capillaries is prevented by proportioning the weight (2.1 g) of the electrode. Data output is done by continuous pO2 measuring; pO2 histograms. During the continuous pO2 measurement the electrode stays on the tissue measuring point thus enabling the direct record of quickly proceeding reactions. The pO2-histogram exhibits the statistical distribution of the local partial oxygen pressures in a studied organ, a quasi sample inquiry is performed in the tissue, based on minimum 100 single values that are obtained by repeated manual repositioning of the electrode. By this, values are obtained on the level and distribution of local pO2 in the tissue so that condition and function of the microcirculation can be objectively assessed. Immediate alterations in the local tissue pO2 suggest regulatory adjustment after hemodynamic changes. Technical problems connected with pO2 measurement in clinical use (sterilization, data acquisition and presentation) are described. The presented technique gives the chance to exactly assess the effects of vasoactive drugs on the microcirculation and to quantify the results of operations, for example after bypass-surgery.\r"

We studied the exercise electrocardiogram of 20 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease, including greater than or equal to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, who had an ischemic response to exercise but no previous anterior myocardial infarction. Precordial leads V1-6 were taken into account. When all 120 leads were measured, those with ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 2.0mm at peak exercise had a mean resting R-wave amplitude of 19.03 +/- 5.81mm; those with ST-segment depression 2.0-1.0mm, R 11.42 +/- 5.99mm; and those with ST-segment depression less than 1.0mm, R 5.9 +/- 5.21mm (p less than 0.001 between groups). When the R-wave amplitude was correlated with the ST-segment depression in each precordial lead, the correlation was 1.0. In leads V1-6, when 67 tracings with ST-segment depression greater than 0.5mm were measured, the correlation was 0.537 (p less than 0.001). In each precordial lead the t values of R-wave differences correlated very strongly (r less than 0.883) with the differences in ST-segment depression. We conclude that precordial R-wave amplitude significantly influences the magnitude of ST-segment depression.\r"

All measurements were carried out within twenty-four hours of admission. Of these, 35 patients had the diagnosis of AMI confirmed. The remainder (n = 36), who did not have AMI (NMI), were divided into two groups: those (n = 18) with an unequivocal history of previous vascular disease and those without vascular disease (n = 18). Platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) release were significantly increased in the AMI group when compared with those in the NMI without vascular disease group or a healthy control group with similar age and sex distribution. Aggregation and TXA2 release in the NMI patients with vascular disease were greater than those in controls and did not differ significantly from those in the AMI group. Patients in the AMI or NMI with vascular disease groups who were taking beta-blockers or calcium channel antagonists at the time of admission showed significantly less platelet aggregation than those who were not taking these drugs. Heparin, added in vitro at therapeutic concentrations, induced significantly more aggregation in patients in the AMI and NMI with vascular disease groups than in the NMI without vascular disease group. We conclude that: platelets obtained from patients with AMI are hyperaggregable and release more TXA2; platelets from patients with significant vascular disease are hyperaggregable, even in the absence of AMI, although they are not as hyperaggregable as those from AMI; treatment with nifedipine and beta-blockers protects these patients from platelet hyperaggregability; heparin induces significant aggregation of platelets from patients with AMI and NMI with vascular disease. These observations are of importance in considering the pathogenesis and treatment of AMI and ischemic heart disease.\r"

The onset of KS during corticosteroid treatment of temporal arteritis is an extremely rare occurrence, this case being only the second one reported in the literature.

A morphometric index was employed on a coded basis to assess the lymphangiograms. Well before myocardial necrosis was evident, at thirty minutes, a striking reduction was evident in lymphatic filling in the ischemic zone: similar changes were seen three hundred sixty minutes after occlusion. Heparin in doses that rendered blood incoagulable did not prevent the lymphatic occlusion or collapse, but they were prevented by two agents that act as cardiac lymphagogues, hyaluronidase and CLS 2210. Lymph flow from the heart was assessed in another 23 dogs. Lymph flow fell sharply after coronary artery occlusion in placebo-treated dogs but was well maintained in dogs treated with hyaluronidase and with CLS 2210. The reduction in cardiac lymphatic filling and lymph flow occurred too early to be a consequence of myocardial necrosis. To the extent that reduced lymphatic drainage allows the local accumulation of potentially toxic products, it could contribute to the local damage. Treatment with the lymphagogues not only maintained lymphatic patency but also reduced evidence of myocardial damage evident on examination by light and electron microscopy. These studies provide an alternative to commonly held concepts on how hyaluronidase reduces myocardial infarction after coronary artery occlusion and support the concept that lymphatic occlusion or collapse plays a role in myocardial infarction.\r"

Twenty-one paired blood and saliva theophylline levels from 16 patients (group 2) were used to test the formula obtained. The formula predicted the serum theophylline concentration within 1.51 microgram/mL in 76% of the samples and within 1.88 microgram/mL in 100% of the samples. There was an excellent correlation between the predicted and actual serum theophylline concentrations, r = .93; thus under controlled conditions of steady-state pharmacokinetics in patients free of other diseases, salivary theophylline levels can be used to accurately predict serum levels.\r"

We sensitized three groups of guinea pigs with an olive pollen extract. Two of the groups were sensitized before removal of their buffy coat and the third group was sensitized after the removal of their buffy coat. The buffy coat cells were incubated with the same antigen and intracardially reinjected into their respective donors. Subsequent challenges by aerosolized antigen and intracardiac injections were performed. We did a basophil degranulation on random samples of buffy coat of tested and control animals. We skin tested the animals and we examined the histopathology of their lungs. The animals reinjected with the incubated buffy coat prior to sensitization showed a greater protection from aerosolized antigen and the onset of their anaphylactic symptoms was significantly delayed when compared with controls. The results of basophil degranulation studies showed that animals sensitized before removal of their buffy coat had approximately a threefold increase of degranulated basophils as compared with animals that were sensitized after removal of buffy coat and approximately a fourfold increase when compared with controls. This degranulation did not affect the specific skin test. Histopathologic observations did not reveal any characteristics typical of anaphylaxis.\r"

Previous studies suggest that cardiac enzymes are of limited value in identifying patients with acute MI in the emergency department. Such studies have not evaluated the use of cardiac enzyme tests to complement decision making in the population of patients clinically designated for ED release. We studied 773 ED visits by patients age greater than or equal to 30 years presenting with chest pain unexplained by thoracic trauma or radiographic abnormalities. Cardiac enzyme levels were not available to the clinicians at the time of the initial visit and disposition of these patients was determined solely by clinical and ECG evaluation. Of the 291 admitted patients, 46 had an MI; 22 of the MI patients had a normal creatine kinase (CK) level. Of the 482 patients released from the ED, 181 patients had an elevated CK level. Among the released patients were five patients with MI. Four released MI patients had a CK level greater than or equal to 200 IU/L and three had an elevated CK-MB fraction (greater than or equal to 12 IU/L). In the population of patients scheduled for release, an elevated CK-MB had sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for MI of 60%, 100%, and 60%, respectively. Although cardiac enzymes cannot be used in isolation to make admission decisions, selective use of CK-MB for final screening of patients otherwise scheduled for ED release may enhance the initial admission of patients with MI at risk for unintentional release.\r"

In this study, aortic and right atrial pressures were monitored simultaneously during modifications of CPR. Three parameters associated with survival or coronary blood flow during CPR were measured: diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), diastolic arteriovenous difference (DAVD), and mean AV difference (MAVD). Standard advanced cardiac life support protocol was used although vasopressors were given by continuous infusion. In a series of two-minute trials, standard CPR, interposed abdominal compression (IAC) CPR, high-compression force (HCF) IAC-CPR, and HCF standard CPR were performed, with each patient serving as his own control. The DAP increased from 25 mm Hg during standard CPR to 43 during IAC CPR (P less than .001) and 50 during HC-IAC-CPR (P less than .001). The MAVD increased from 4 to 8 mm Hg during HCF-IAC-CPR (P less than .05). IAC-CPR had inconsistent effects on the DAVD. Three patients had a return of spontaneous circulation during the modifications of CPR after a mean of 43 minutes of asystole with standard CPR. In the seven autopsied patients, no significant abdominal injury was found. All forms of CPR studies produced DAVD in the majority of patients well below the minimum DAVD needed for resuscitation in animal models of prolonged arrest. Although the interposed abdominal compression seems to offer some advantages over standard CPR, these hemodynamic data suggest that it would be unlikely to improve survival rates appreciably.\r"

All patients from birth to 16 years with proven or suspected cases of cervical spine injury who had received cervical spine radiographs and who had been treated at either the Children's Memorial Hospital or the Northwestern University Spine Trauma Unit during period 1974 to 1984 also were included. Each child's chart was reviewed, and 84 clinical variables were recorded. All radiographs were reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist. Of 206 children studied, 59 had cervical spine injuries. A clinical algorithm was derived using the following eight variables: neck pain; neck tenderness; limitation of neck mobility; history of trauma to the neck; and abnormalities of reflexes, strength, sensation, or mental status. The following decision rule was selected: Positive findings in any of these eight variables mandates cervical spine radiography. This algorithm correctly identified 58 of 59 children with cervical spine injury, yielding a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 54%. Cervical spine radiographs could have been avoided in 79 children (38% of the entire sample). This algorithm performed better than did models derived from logistic regression analysis of the same data. Validation trials are required prior to the implementation of this or other clinical decision algorithms in practice.\r"

Both specialty types were defined by type of practice, rather than by specialty training or board certification. Ninety-five (38%) emergency physicians and 79 (32%) internists responded. Factor and correlation analyses identified six satisfaction indexes: resources, professional autonomy, administrative autonomy, patient relationships, professional relationships, and status. Physicians practicing emergency medicine were less satisfied, that is, reported more difference between current and preferred conditions, than physicians practicing internal medicine with professional autonomy, patient relations, and status (by t tests, P less than .01 for each). Emergency physicians were more satisfied with professional relationships (P less than .01). Only 40% of emergency physicians, versus 60% of internists, reported no intention to leave their present position within the next two years (P less than .02). Expectation of position change by physicians practicing emergency medicine was predicted by dissatisfaction with professional autonomy, lack of board certification, recency of graduation from medical school, and belief that monetary compensation would be higher elsewhere (R square, 0.35; P less than .01), while variables such as patient load, hours worked per week, and hospital size proved unimportant. We identified areas of dissatisfaction among emergency physicians that differed from those among internists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Very few studies about prehospital care of pediatric emergencies have been published. With new interest in emergency care of the pediatric population demonstrated by the development of Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Advanced Pediatric Life Support, it is imperative to have data that define the different types of problems encountered in the prehospital care setting and their outcomes. Prehospital assessment forms were reviewed retrospectively over a consecutive 12-month period beginning August 1, 1983. Patients under 19 years of age were studied in a service area with a population of 557,700. A total of 3,184 forms were analyzed, representing approximately 10% of all ambulance runs. This contrasts sharply with the fact that the pediatric age group represents 32% of the population. The major users were the youngest and the oldest of the pediatric population. Of the cases, 54.4% were in the trauma category. The largest trauma group was motor vehicle accidents in the adolescent age group. Male patients predominated in the trauma cases. Medical disorders were the major reason for prehospital care in the very young. The demand for emergency medical services (EMS) occurred mainly during the summer months and on weekends. More than 50 percent of all EMS pediatric cases occurred during the hours of 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Advanced life support was associated with prolonged on-scene time and had a relatively low use and success rate in the younger pediatric population. Resuscitation of 23 cases of pediatric prehospital arrest resulted in no survivors to hospital discharge. The appropriateness of prolonged time spent on scene (mean of 18.3 minutes in 1,196 cases) for prehospital pediatric emergencies requires further evaluation.\r"

The purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between the survival rates of patients with presumed hemorrhagic shock due to penetrating injuries and the total prehospital time required to manage and deliver those patients to a single regional trauma center in a large urban area. During a 30-month-period, 498 consecutive victims of penetrating injury, presenting in the field with a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less and transported to a single regional trauma center, were prospectively evaluated in terms of age; initial prehospital trauma score; injury severity score (ISS); TRISS probability of survival; response, scene, transport, and total prehospital times; and survival (discharge from hospital). All patients were managed and transported by a single urban paramedic service that has a fairly uniform response time (5.3 +/- 3 min) throughout its entire service area. The response area is spread out over an approximately 1,000 square-mile region, and transport times to the regional trauma center can exceed a half hour. The total prehospital time (TPT) was calculated as the time elapsed from the receipt of the emergency call to the time of arrival at the regional trauma center. Patients arbitrarily were categorized into four subsets according to the initial prehospital trauma score (1, 2 to 6, 7 to 11, 12 to 15). Patients also were analyzed in terms of four incremental groups of increasing TPT (0-20, 21-30, 31-40, greater than 40 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animal studies of brain ischemia associate brain lactate levels of more than 18 mumol/g with irreversible neuronal injury. Lowering brain lactate therefore may prevent or minimize ischemic brain necrosis. Earlier studies in our laboratory using fasted rats demonstrated that sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) decreases ischemic brain lactate when given either before or immediately after partial global ischemia (PGI). Other investigators have shown that fed animals have more glucose and generate higher lactate levels by anaerobic metabolism during PGI. We evaluated the ability of DCA to lower brain lactate in fed male Wistar rats subjected to PGI. Four groups (n = 6 each) were studied--PGI and control rats with either placebo or DCA treatment. PGI was induced for 30 minutes by combining bilateral carotid artery occlusion with hemorrhagic hypotension. This was followed by release of carotid occlusion, reinfusion of shed blood, and immediate treatment with either DCA (25 mg/kg, IV) or placebo. Thirty minutes later brains were frozen in situ with liquid nitrogen for extraction and measurement of tissue glucose, glycogen, and lactate. Blood glucose and serum lactate were monitored throughout the experiment. No significant differences were found between the two PGI groups in brain glucose, brain glycogen, or ischemia-induced elevations in blood glucose and serum lactate. However, brain lactate was significantly lower in DCA-treated (12.5 mumol/g) than in untreated (22.8 mumol/g) PGI rats (P less than .001). In addition, all untreated PGI rats had levels of more than 18 mumol/g, and therefore were at high risk for neuronal necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro flow was significantly faster than in vivo flow (P = .001). In vivo, mean flow rates were 11 mL/min for the 20-gauge needle and 13 mL/min for the 13-gauge needle by gravity. The mean flows by 300 mm Hg pressure for the same needles were 24 mL/min and 29 mL/min. While the in vivo flow rates were significantly greater for the 13-gauge versus the 20-gauge needle, the differences were not clinically significant (2 mL/min difference by gravity and 5 mL/min difference by pressure). The clinically comparable in vivo rates for the two needles tested indicated that the rates are dependent on flow through the bone marrow rather than the size of the needle. The data suggest that while intraosseous infusion is a rapid technique for gaining vascular access, the flow rates achieved may not be sufficient for the definitive treatment of severe hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock alone.\r"

The cats were sacrificed after two days and their lungs were examined by a pathologist. Mean diazepam levels reached a peak two minutes after the administration of diazepam and remained elevated above therapeutic levels for 90 minutes. There was no significant change in pH, PO2, or PCO2 for either group. Histologic examination of the lungs showed a significantly increased incidence of pneumonitis in the diazepam group as compared to the saline group. This study demonstrates that although diazepam is well absorbed when administered endotracheally, it has adverse effects on the lungs that may preclude endotracheal use in the currently available commercial form.\r"

Patient cooperation with therapy can be achieved using haloperidol by the IM, IV, or oral route. The safety and efficacy of haloperidol in the emergency department setting was examined. Haloperidol was administered to 136 patients to control behavior. Eighty-eight received the drug in the ED; 18 of these 88 were critical patients receiving the drug during resuscitation. Forty-eight of the 136 were crisis intervention center patients. Ninety patients were acutely intoxicated with ethanol. Twenty-three patients had head trauma; 20 of these also were inebriated. Various other drugs were responsible for the behavior of 15 patients. Acute psychosis was involved in 40 cases. Thirty-one patients were thought to have a personality disorder. The route of administration of haloperidol was intramuscular in 110, IV in 19, and oral in seven patients. Disruptive behavior was alleviated within 30 minutes in 113 of 136 (83%) patients. Effect was judged suboptimal in 20 of 136 (15%), and no effect was noted in three of 136 (2%) patients. Four complications (3%) were noted, three minor and one more serious episode of hypotension in a critical patient. Haloperidol is a safe and efficacious drug for use with disruptive patients in the emergency setting. It is a useful tool for management of agitation of diverse etiologies.\r"

Of the 92 patients reviewed, 37 had serious complications including hypoventilation, loss of protective airway reflexes, seizures, hypotension, hemodynamically significant arrhythmias, or death. Patients with complications had increased heart rate, depressed level of consciousness, depressed Glasgow Coma Scale, and prolonged QRS interval, as compared to patients without complications. All 37 patients with serious complications required intubation in the emergency department. A Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8 was the most sensitive predictor of serious complications (sensitivity = .86; specificity = .89). This was significantly better than the QRS interval (QRS greater than or equal to 100 msec; sensitivity = 59; specificity = .76). We conclude that level of consciousness is a better predictor of risk of complications and need for ICU admission than the QRS interval. Patients who are responsive to verbal stimuli on leaving the ED are at very low risk of developing complications.\r"

The pills that were radiodense through water were studied in a human cadaver model, and their densities were quantified by computed tomography (CT). Thirty-five of 312 pills were radiopaque in 15 cm or more of water, and 23 of these pills were radiopaque on a plain radiograph when placed in the stomach of a cadaver. Common mnemonics used to identify radiopaque pills were found to be incomplete and inadequate. Chloral hydrate, iron-containing preparations, calcium carbonate, iodinated compounds, acetazolamide, busulfan, and potassium preparations were consistently radiopaque. Antihistamines, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants demonstrated varying radiopacity. There was varying radiopacity among the same medications made by different manufacturers. The presence of an enteric coating did not assure that the pill would be radiopaque. Merely radiographing a pill that has been placed on a standard radiograph cassette will make pills that are actually radiolucent in the body appear radiopaque. This test cannot be used to predict radiopacity in vivo. Visibility when radiographed through 15 cm or more of water and a CT radiodensity of more than 1,300 Hounsfield units are predictors of the radiopacity of a pill in the stomach of a cadaver model on a standard KUB radiograph. Variables, such as the size of the patient, the arrangement of pills in the stomach, air contrasting a pill, and the specific composition of the enteric coating or the pillmatrix, affect the radiodensity of pills.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess this risk, ionizing radiation exposure was analyzed during a nine-year period for 128 ED personnel. The group consisted of 21 physicians, 92 nurses, and 15 ancillary personnel. Exposure was measured for both penetrating and nonpenetrating radiation using standard film dosimeter badges. Film badge use compliance was 66.7% for physicians, 86.2% for nurses, and 86.7% for ancillary personnel. Penetrating radiation exposure averaged 0.12 mrem/month for physicians, 0.70 mrem/month for nurses, and 0 mrem/month for ancillary personnel, all less than the average natural background exposure. We concluded that if standard radiation precautions are taken, the occupational risk from ionizing radiation exposure to personnel in the ED is minimal, and that routine monitoring of radiation exposure of ED personnel is unnecessary.\r"

This is particularly true in community hospital programs with little funding allocated to research, limited facilities, and few staff members actively involved in research. Our purpose is to describe a research curriculum designed to operate within a community-based residency program. This curriculum identifies a detailed set of educational objectives in research techniques with the expectation that on completion of the residency program, the resident will be able to critically evaluate medical literature and independently design a research project. We have developed a specific plan for meeting these objectives with coordinated seminars, readings, journal clubs, research projects or exhibits, and professional conferences. We suggest some practical methods of motivating residents and attending staff to pursue clinical investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension ideally should cause a proportionately greater reduction of resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed than in the systemic circulation. This should limit the occurrence of systemic hypotension, which can complicate the use of most vasodilator drugs. Urapidil is a new vasodilator that acts by postsynaptic alpha 1-blockade while inhibiting the aortic pressure baroreceptor reflex and reducing central sympathetic tone. We investigated and compared the short-term effects of Urapidil and hydralazine in 10 patients suffering varying degrees of pulmonary hypertension. Each patient received either 0.35 mg/kg hydralazine or 0.75 mg/kg Urapidil intravenously on 2 sequential days in a randomized order. The main effect of Urapidil was to decrease the mean pulmonary artery pressure in all 10 patients from 44 +/- 4 to 37 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). After Urapidil infusion, the mean decrease of resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed (32%) exceeded that in the systemic circulation (25%). In contrast, pulmonary artery pressure remained unchanged with hydralazine, and predominant systemic vasodilation occurred: systemic vascular resistance decreased by 45%, whereas pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 25%. Hydralazine markedly increased the cardiac index and induced tachycardia. Urapidil maintained the heart rate nearly constant and only slightly increased the cardiac index, thereby fostering the diastolic emptying of the pulmonary circulation. No significant change in arterial oxygenation occurred with either drug, although arterial oxygen partial pressure tended to increase with hydralazine. Urapidil may be a promising drug in the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

We investigated whether excess vascular collagen contributes to chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension by administering the proline analogue cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline (cHyp), an agent relatively specific for inhibiting collagen production, to rats exposed to chronic hypoxia. Sprague-Dawley rats (weighting 200 g) were exposed to air or hypoxia (10% O2-90% N2) for 3 wk. Groups studied were: air-exposed injected with saline, air-exposed injected with cHyp, hypoxic injected with saline, and hypoxic injected with cHyp. At the end of 3 wk, we measured mean right ventricular pressure (RVP) of animals breathing room air and hydroxyproline and desmosine contents of the main pulmonary artery trunk. Hypoxia increased RVP from 13 +/- 1 to 27 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); cHyp partially prevented this increase since RVP was 17 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). There was no effect of cHyp on cardiac output. Hypoxia increased collagen from 0.9 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.3 mg/artery (p less than 0.05); cHyp completely prevented this increase since collagen was 1.0 +/- 0.2 mg/artery (p less than 0.05). Hypoxia increased elastin from 1.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.2 mg/artery (p less than 0.05); cHyp had no apparent effect since elastin was 2.1 +/- 0.1 mg/artery. Also, cHyp did not affect RVP or vascular collagen or elastin in air-breathing animals. The cHyp treatment prevented luminal narrowing and thickening of arteriolar walls by hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although no arrhythmias were induced, 5 patients had symptoms (3 presyncope and 2 chest pain) with rapid atrial pacing during but not prior to the aminophylline infusion.

Frequency of GE reflux in the asthmatics was 57%; in the chronic bronchitics it was 56%. Pulmonary function tests did not show any differences between patients with or without reflux. The GE reflux episodes were more numerous but shorter in asthmatics than in chronic bronchitics. Patients with digestive symptoms alone were no different from chronic bronchitics with respect to reflux. The mechanism whereby reflux triggers pulmonary problems was investigated using the following 2 tests: scintiscan for pulmonary aspiration, and esophageal acid infusion (0.1N HCl). Six pulmonary aspirations were detected. Only asthmatics, with or without reflux, showed any significant variations in maximal expiratory flow at 50% and 25% of VC after HCl infusion. Thus, our results show that asthmatics differ from chronic bronchitics by the characteristics of their reflux.\r"

  ".W": "The bronchoconstrictor activity of an aerosol of leukotriene E4(LTE4) was compared with that of histamine in 5 normal and in 6 asthmatic subjects to define the relative potency of LTE4 between the groups using 3 indices of airway response. The FEV1 and the flow rate measured at 30% of vital capacity from partial and maximal expiratory maneuvers (V30-P and V30-M) were measured. The geometric mean (GSEM) concentration of LTE4 required to reduce the V30-P by 30% was 0.30 (1.46) mM in the normal subjects, and 0.058 (1.63) in the asthmatic subjects; LTE4 was 39-fold more potent than histamine in the former and 14-fold in the latter group. Further, we observed that when normal and asthmatic subjects were compared at a degree of bronchoconstriction resulting in a 30% decrement in the V30-P after inhaling LTE4, there was a greater response in the asthmatic group than in the normal group of the accompanying change in the FEV1. The decrements in the FEV1 were not significantly different between the 2 groups after inhaling histamine. This study demonstrates that LTE4 is a potent bronchoconstrictor agonist in humans and suggests that airway responsiveness to this agonist differs substantially with the index of bronchoconstriction used for assessment of airway response.\r"

  ".W": "Because basenji-greyhound dogs have greater bronchial reactivity to a range of inhaled stimuli than mongrel dogs do, and because bronchial hyperreactivity to nonspecific stimuli is characteristic of asthma, we asked whether basenji-greyhound dogs have greater bronchial reactivity to hypotonic and isotonic aerosols than mongrel dogs do. We assessed bronchial reactivity by measuring both the total pulmonary resistance and the bronchial response to an acetylcholine aerosol, before and after delivery of hypotonic and isotonic aerosols. Bronchial reactivity as measured by a change in total pulmonary resistance increased 9-fold after delivery of hypotonic and 5-fold after delivery of isotonic aerosols in 5 anesthetized basenji-greyhound dogs, but not in 3 similarly challenged mongrel dogs (p less than 0.01). Bronchial reactivity as measured by an increased bronchial response to acetylcholine aerosol increased 3-fold in basenji-greyhound dogs but not in mongrel dogs. Thus, hypotonic and isotonic aerosols increase bronchial reactivity in basenji-greyhound dogs. We also asked whether vagal or nonvagal pathways are involved in the increase in total pulmonary resistance induced by a hypotonic aerosol. Both vagal and nonvagal pathways appear to be involved, since blockade of the vagal pathway by intravenously administered atropine only partially inhibited the bronchoconstriction induced by a hypotonic aerosol (54%). Disodium cromoglycate, which inhibits vagal and nonvagal pathways, partially inhibited the bronchoconstriction (57%), but even in combination with atropine, did not completely inhibit it (68%). Our observations in basenji-greyhound dogs are similar to results in asthmatic subjects, suggesting that basenji-greyhound dogs are useful experimental animals in which to study the mechanisms by which hypotonic and isotonic aerosols increase bronchial reactivity.\r"

To evaluate the effects of the pattern and duration of exercise on the response to SO2 exposure, the subjects were then exposed to the same environmental conditions while exercising continuously for 30 min. Specific airway resistance (SRaw) was measured by body plethysmography before each exposure and after each exercise. All SO2 responses were significantly greater than the clean air responses. With intermittent exercise and SO2 exposure, mean SRaw measurements (preexposure and after 10, 20, and 30 min of exercise) were 5.4, 14.7, 12.8, and 11.1 cm H2O/s. After SO2 exposure with continuous exercise, the mean SRaw showed an increase from 5.2 to 17.3 cm H2O/s. This increase was significantly (p = 0.018) greater than the response after the third exercise in the intermittent protocol. It appears that asthmatics show an attenuated response to repetitive exercise in an atmosphere of 1.00 ppm SO2 and that the response to SO2 exposure develops rapidly and is maintained during 30 min of continuous exercise.\r"

Other factors potentially involved in the exercise effect on nasal resistance are: increased alae nasi muscle activity, passive redistribution of blood to exercising muscle and away from the nasal mucosa, increased nasal air flow, and hyperventilation. In order to determine the importance of these factors, 6 healthy adults had nasal pressure/flow data collected at rest and after bicycle exercise at 100 to 160 W. Erect exercise with nose breathing, erect exercise with mouth breathing, voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation at the minute volumes achieved during exercise, and supine exercise were performed. The alae nasi muscles were voluntarily activated during pressure/flow measurements. The pressure/flow data were displayed on a logarithmic plot; parallel rightward shifts of this plot indicate falls in nasal resistance mediated by enlargement of the air passage. The position of the plot was defined by the flow rate at which the slope of the logarithmic plot steepens abruptly (Vtr). Erect exercise with nose breathing caused a fall in nasal resistance in all 6 subjects (mean change in Vtr, +14.4 L/min). Exercise mouth breathing and supine exercise caused similar falls in nasal resistance in all subjects (mean change of Vtr, +14.1 and +14.2 L/min, respectively). Voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation had no effect on nasal pressure/flow properties in any subject (mean change in Vtr, -1.3 L/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

None of the patients with stable or increased flow rate measurements required intubation. The progression of upper airway edema in 14 patients was characterized by obliteration of the aryepiglottic folds, arytenoid eminences, and interarytenoid areas by boggy, edematous tissue that prolapsed to occlude the airway. These changes correlated with an increased size of cutaneous burns (p less than 0.0001), the presence of burns of the face and neck (p less than 0.05), and more rapid intravenously administered fluid resuscitation (p less than 0.04). Anatomic and physiologic changes consistent with upper airway dysfunction occur frequently in burn victims. Progression of these abnormalities correlates with the severity and distribution of cutaneous injury and is influenced by intravenously administered fluid.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that unlike normal subjects patients with cervical cord transection have an increase in VC when changing from the seated to the supine posture. To investigate the mechanism of this paradoxical increase, we measured static lung volumes in both the seated and supine posture in 14 consecutive patients with tetraplegia (C4-C7) and in 4 patients with paraplegia (Th4-Th7). The increase in VC in the supine compared with the seated posture was (mean +/- SE) 0.41 +/- 0.07 L (16.0% of the seated value) in the tetraplegic subjects and 0.40 +/- 0.01 L (11.2% of the seated value) in the paraplegic subjects (p less than 0.001). However, TLC in all subjects was 0.28 +/- 0.05 L smaller in the supine posture (p less than 0.001), thus indicating that the larger VC in this posture is related to a reduction in residual volume (RV) rather than to an increased mechanical advantage of the diaphragm. The reduction in RV in the supine posture was consistent, averaging 0.72 +/- 0.06 L (29.1% of the seated value) in the tetraplegic subjects and 0.62 +/- 0.21 L (37.6 percent of the seated value) in the paraplegic subjects (p less than 0.001). Inflating blood pressure cuffs at the bases of the legs prior to the assumption of the supine posture diminished the reduction in RV with recumbency by only 0.10 +/- 0.02 L. In contrast, the postural dependence of RV was abolished when the abdomen was tightly supported by elastic straps and maintained constant in configuration during postural changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 4 male patients with OSAS, 92 nonrapid eye movement (NERM) sleep apnea episodes and 37 rapid eye movement (REM) sleep apnea episodes were analyzed breath by breath during a one-night study. We calculated the pressure time index of the diaphragm (the product of inspiratory time/cycle duration (Tl/Ttot) and mean transdiaphragmatic pressure swing), evaluated the sleep stages via EEG, and performed frequency spectrum analysis of the EMG of the diaphragm. It was found that with each occluded inspiratory effort the tension time index of the diaphragm (TTdi) increased progressively to reach or slightly exceed the fatigue threshold, 0.15 to 0.18 (during NREM sleep the TTdi of the last occluded breath was 0.195 +/- 0.045 and during REM sleep the TTdi of the last occluded breath was 0.153 +/- 0.037); that a close time relationship was observed as well between the onset of arousal and the opening of the airways. Our data suggest that the airways may be triggered to open by a protective reflex originating in the larynx or the inspiratory muscles upon reaching a certain degree of contraction.\r"

We measured the ventilatory (Vl), diaphragmatic (EMGdi), and genioglossal (EMGgg) electromyographic responses to CO2 in awake and sleeping goats; delta Vl/delta PETCO2 decreased from awake (0.85 +/- 0.087 L/min/mm Hg) to NREM sleep (0.69 +/- 0.069) to REM sleep (0.57 +/- 0.078, p less than 0.005 versus awake). There were minimal decreases in delta EMGdi/delta PETCO2 and EMGdi at a PETCO2 of 55 mm Hg from awake to NREM, but a significant decrease in EMGdi at a PETCO2 of 55 mm Hg during REM sleep (p less than 0.025 versus NREM). Inspiratory EMGgg was only present above a PCO2 threshold, which was similar for each state (49.3 +/- 2.3 mm Hg PETCO2 awake, 48.8 +/- 2.4 during NREM, 49.5 +/- 2.5 during REM), and delta EMGgg/delta PETCO2 tended to be less during both sleep states compared with that while awake (p = 0.10). At any PCO2, inspiratory EMGgg was markedly inhibited during REM sleep when rapid eye movements were present (phasic REM). We conclude that there is disproportionate inhibition of the genioglossus relative to the diaphragm at low CO2 tensions and at any PCO2 during phasic REM sleep. This imbalance may predispose the upper airway to inspiratory occlusion during sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol consistently decreases genioglossal electromyographic (EMG) activity in awake men, but in women this response is more variable, possibly because of the menstrual cycle. To assess the interaction between alcohol and the menstrual cycle on genioglossal EMG activity, we measured ventilation and genioglossal EMG activity in 9 normal women before and after they drank 1 ml/kg alcohol. The effect of alcohol on ventilation and genioglossal EMG activity was studied twice in each subject: once during the follicular phase and again during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Measurements were made while the subjects breathed room air and rebreathed a hypercapnic gas mixture. The ventilatory response to CO2 was significantly greater during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Alcohol had no effect on resting ventilation or the ventilatory response to CO2 during either phase of the menstrual cycle. However, alcohol significantly decreased peak integrated genioglossal EMG activity during the follicular (low progesterone) phase but not during the luteal (high progesterone) phase of the cycle. The relative alcohol resistance of genioglossal EMG activity during the luteal phase may explain in part the low incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in premenopausal women and the benefit that some male patients with obstructive sleep apnea have derived from treatment with progesterone.\r"

The acoustic reflection technique was used to assess pharyngeal size, lung volume dependence, and pharyngeal \"compliance\" in 8 patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea, all of whom were snorers, and in 8 weight-matched, snoring control subjects with normal sleep studies. Patients with central sleep apnea when compared with control subjects exhibited markedly increased specific pharyngeal \"compliance\" (0.12 +/- 0.05 versus 0.03 +/- 0.01 cm H2O-1; p less than 0.001), increased change in pharyngeal area from FRC to RV (0.8 +/- 0.5 versus 0.03 +/- 0.3 cm2; p less than 0.05), and a larger pharyngeal area at FRC (4.7 +/- 0.9 versus 3.8 +/- 0.8 cm2; p less than 0.03).

At the time of the study, all patients were clinically stable and had no recurrent nerve palsy. Measurements of airway area by ART and CT were performed in the supine posture while patients breathed quietly at FRC. We found that there was considerable intersubject variability in area-distance functions determined by acoustic reflections. None of the subjects had a flat tracheal plateau. Once the acoustic and CT data were aligned, we compared cross-sectional areas at various distances from the glottis. Comparison points were separated by 1 cm, and as many as 13 different CT sections were used in some subjects. Mean values for all data points (n = 83) were 2.45 +/- SD = 0.69 cm2 and 2.56 +/- SD = 0.82 cm2 for the acoustic and CT methods, respectively, Z = 0.93; p greater than 0.05. Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92; p less than 0.0001. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the acoustic reflection technique may be used reliably for clinical and physiologic studies of the upper airways in humans.\r"

To evaluate the possible role of a soluble mediator in enzyme induction, the ability of conditioned medium (CM) from Mo-T cocultures to stimulate ACE in fresh Mo was examined. These studies demonstrated that CM promoted a dose-dependent increase in ACE. Generation of the active factor required both Mo and T during culture since neither cell alone yielded active CM. Time course studies revealed that the ACE-inducing activity appeared in CM after 3 to 4 days of culture and increased steadily thereafter. The CM effectively induced ACE in Mo from several donors in contrast to T-dependent induction, which required autologous conditions. The time courses for T-dependent and CM-dependent ACE induction were similar, and the results suggested that the Mo must go through some period of maturation before they respond to CM. We conclude that a soluble mediator derived from Mo-T cocultures enhances Mo ACE production. This in vitro system may be a useful experimental model of the in vivo induction of ACE in the Mo-derived sarcoid epithelioid cell.\r"

Supernatants from specific Blastomyces antigen-stimulated lymphocyte cultures were collected, and treatment with the supernatant to control donors' macrophages resulted in increased phagocytosis and inhibition of intracellular growth.

Repeat bronchoscopy yielded a new treatable diagnosis in 1 (5%) of 21 patients in Group I and in 27 (59%) of 46 patients in group II. Sixty-two percent of patients in Group I died within 1 month. It appears that in patients with AIDS who have persistent or worsening pulmonary infiltrates despite therapy, repeat bronchoscopy after a short interval (i.e., less than 1 month) is unlikely to have therapeutic implications. In contrast, those patients whose pulmonary involvement resolves initially may benefit from an aggressive diagnostic approach if new pulmonary infiltrates appear. In both groups, nondiagnostic bronchoscopies were common (29% overall). The most commonly missed bronchoscopic diagnoses (proved by open lung biopsy) were cytomegalovirus pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, and neither had much therapeutic implication. Further, 12 patients in Group II with nondiagnostic bronchoscopies improved both radiographically and clinically even though no treatment was given.\r"

  ".W": "The local mechanisms that result in the cellular inflammation and bronchial airway hyperreactivity that characterize allergic bronchial asthma are poorly defined. In order to study these processes, we developed a method for local allergen challenge using a fiberoptic bronchoscope and direct observation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assess the airway responses to allergen. In these studies, 11 allergic asthmatics (all of whom had previously demonstrated a late-phase asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenge) and 6 healthy, asymptomatic subjects volunteered to undergo bronchoalveolar lavage after local airway challenge via a bronchoscope wedged into subsegmental airways. These studies revealed that asthmatic airways respond to allergen with an immediate pallor followed by reactive hyperemia, edema, and bronchial narrowing. This site and a control site were relavaged at 48 or 96 h after the immediate response. Neutrophils and eosinophils increased significantly at 48 h after challenge, as did helper T-lymphocytes. Characteristically, at 96 h, neutrophil counts returned to normal values, whereas eosinophiles and helper T-cells remained elevated. Peroxidase-staining cells were also elevated at 48 h after local allergen challenge. Electron microscopy revealed degranulation of mast cells and eosinophils, both immediately and later (48 and 96 h) after local allergen challenge. Macrophages were highly activated and had phagocytized, partially intact granules from both eosinophils and mast cells. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between the concentration of allergen required to produce a visible airway response and a positive end-point skin titration in the asthmatic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lung collagen was decreased 17%, and collagen fragments in lavage fluid were increased 4- to 5-fold in O2-exposed rats compared with those in control rats. No biochemical evidence of elastin degradation was found. Mild emphysematous changes and a leftward shift of fluid-filled, pressure-volume curves were induced within 2 wk after recovery from exposure to O2. Administration of the lathyrogen beta-aminopropionitrile worsened the emphysematous lesion produced by hyperoxia, suggesting that replacement of connective tissue during repair limits the extent of emphysema. We conclude that lung collagen is degraded and an emphysematous lesion is produced by relatively short exposure to toxic amounts of oxygen.\r"

  ".W": "A significant number of asthmatic subjects are provoked by allergic reactions. The underlying pathophysiologic event is mast cell degranulation with the release and generation of the mediators of anaphylaxis. Histamine, one of the major mast cell mediators, causes 10- to 50-fold increases in guinea pig lung cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) through H1 receptor stimulation. Employing monoclonal antibodies directed at cyclic GMP, immunocytochemical techniques were used to identify those specific cells in lung responding to histamine stimulation with increases in cyclic GMP. The most responsive cells were alveolar and parenchymal macrophages, pleural lining cells, and endothelial and epithelial cells. Little or no increases in bronchial or vascular smooth muscle cyclic GMP was noted. At the height of the reaction, a generalized increase in cyclic GMP staining of all alveolar cells was observed. These findings suggest that the lining cells of the lung including macrophages, mesothelial, endothelial, and epithelial cells may be the most responsive cells to histamine released during allergic responses. The absence of muscular staining suggests that cyclic GMP does not participate in histamine-stimulated muscle contraction.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage disclosed a helper T-lymphocyte alveolitis, and transbronchial lung biopsies showed sarcoidlike epithelioid granulomas. These granulomas contained dust identified by mineralogic analyses as consisting mainly of aluminum particles. Nasal and liver biopsies and a Kveim test did not reveal extrapulmonary granulomatous infiltration. An extensive immunologic work-up showed none of the abnormalities classically seen in sarcoidosis, but peripheral blood lymphocytes exhibited blastic transformation in the presence of soluble aluminum compounds. About 1 yr after cessation of exposure, a chest radiograph and lung function tests remained essentially unchanged, but signs of alveolitis disappeared. This observation suggests that aluminum may cause granulomatous lung disease accompanied by a helper T-lymphocyte alveolitis, similar to that of berylliosis and sarcoidosis. Further observations would be necessary to show if this constitutes an early stage of aluminum-induced fibrosis (aluminum lung).\r"

Two of the 4 patients who had MCBN had not received sympathomimetics intravenously or by an intracardiac route. Therefore, mechanisms other than infusions of large doses of catecholamines are probably involved in production of this cardiac lesion in asthmatics.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the role of mediastinal re-exploration in the development of sternal wound complications. From a series of 2,271 patients undergoing median sternotomy for open-heart surgery between 1979 and 1984, 71 (3.1%) were re-explored for excessive bleeding. Nine of these patients died in the early postoperative period of noninfectious complications. The remaining patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (54 patients) were re-explored without subsequent problems. Group 2 (8 patients) developed sternal and costochondral wound complications. Comparison of age, intercurrent and pre-existing disease, total bypass time, crossclamp time, and postoperative hemodynamic status showed no statistical difference. All patients bled an average rate of 247 ml/hr. However, the average time before re-exploration was 7.6 hours in group 1 compared to 13.8 hours in group 2 (P less than 0.001). Sternal wound complications may be minimized by a policy of early re-exploration for excessive postoperative bleeding (greater than 200 ml/hr for 4 hours).\r"

Seven myxomas were left atrial and the other were right atrial in location. The carcinoma was predominantly located in the right ventricle. Eight of the nine patients were female; ages ranged from 32 to 85 years. Of the myxomas, five displayed fever and dyspnea, two congestive heart failure and one transient ischemic episodes. The patient with carcinoma was in right heart failure. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization as well as echocardiography when it became available. Five myxomas were correctly diagnosed preoperatively while three were thought to have mitral stenosis. The patient with carcinoma showed a large right ventricular filling defect and a picture of constriction. All myxoma patients underwent surgery--three via left thoracotomy and five via sternotomy. Seven patients survived; however, the patient with right atrial myxoma was explored via the left chest for mitral stenosis and the myxoma was not discovered. She died of a pulmonary embolism pathologically confirmed as myxoma. All survivors have been followed by yearly echocardiograms and are free of recurrence. The patient with carcinoma died before surgery could be performed. Autopsy revealed almost complete replacement of the right ventricle by tumor and constrictive pericarditis. The terminal event was pulmonary embolus of squamous carcinoma. Although cardiac tumors are a rare entity, a high incidence of suspicion plus modern diagnostic methods can yield the diagnosis and allow a curative operation.\r"

Overall limb salvage was significantly lower in the proximal group (47.8%) than in the distal group (96.6%). A revascularization for healing was required in 12 per cent of hospitalizations. Mortality was significantly higher in the proximal group, but the healing times for open wounds and overall morbidity were not different between the groups. Diabetic foot infections must receive careful and timely treatment by concerned surgeons. The outcome of proximal infections is poor, with major risk of limb loss and mortality, but not hopeless. The treatment of distal infections derives greater limb salvage with nevertheless similar morbidity and healing time.\r"

The operative mortality rate was 5 per cent. Cumulative life-table limb salvage rates for the 40 extremities were 91 per cent at 1 year and 81 per cent at 3 years. Graft patency rates at 1 and 3 years were 88 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively. Survival rates for the 36 patients were 91 per cent and 58 per cent at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Among 134 patients younger than 80 years who underwent 142 distal bypasses during the same 3 1/2-year period, no operative deaths occurred. In this younger group, cumulative life-table rates at 1 and 3 years were 89 per cent and 89 per cent, respectively, for limb salvage, 86 per cent and 85 per cent, respectively, for graft patency, and 93 per cent and 78 per cent, respectively, for survival. There were no statistically significant differences in these figures for the younger group when compared with corresponding figures for the older group. Among the 36 very elderly patients who underwent distal bypass for limb salvage, 24 patients (67%) with 25 revascularized limbs are alive and have a salvaged, functional extremity after follow-up as long as 41 months (mean, 21 months). These results suggest that an aggressive approach using distal bypass is warranted for limb salvage in very elderly patients.\r"

Forty patients with symptoms that suggested intermittent claudication comprised our study group. All had non-arterial cause of their complaint. The nonvascular origin of the symptoms was suggested initially by clinical evaluation in 30 patients and by noninvasive evaluation in 25 patients. The neurospinal origin of symptoms was obscured in 15 patients because of the concomitant presence of significant arterial occlusive disease as demonstrated by noninvasive arterial testing. Twelve of these 15 patients underwent arterial reconstruction, which did not relieve their symptoms. Subsequently, the neurospinal origin of their symptoms was proven by appropriate evaluation and therapy. Forms of evaluation that proved helpful in the differential diagnosis were lumbosacral spine x-rays, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity studies, computerized tomography, Doppler noninvasive assessment and, at times arteriography and contrast myelography.\r"

Twenty-six of these patients had thrombi characterized as free floating, and 13 had thrombi that were adherent to the IVC wall without a free-floating component. The incidence of initial pulmonary embolism confirmed by either pulmonary arteriography or high probability ventilation-perfusion lung scanning was 50 per cent (13/26) in those patients with free-floating IVC thrombi, but 15 per cent (2/13) in those with closely adherent mural thrombi (P less than 0.05). Pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulation occurred in 27 per cent (7/26) of patients with free-floating clots, but in only 17 per cent (1/8) of cases with adherent thrombi (P greater than 0.05). These data strongly suggest that patients with documented free-floating inferior vena caval thrombi are at a significant risk for pulmonary embolism as an initial event and perhaps also as a recurrent embolus, even in the presence of adequate anticoagulation. When such thrombi are identified, the overall incidence of pulmonary embolus is high and conventional anticoagulant treatment with heparin may not be sufficient.\r"

  ".W": "Of 95 patients consecutively diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 52 (55%) had antibodies to human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus, type I. Antibody positivity was strongly associated with skin involvement, leukemia, and hypercalcemia (p less than 0.02). Two patients had systemic opportunistic infections. Neither meningeal nor lung infiltration was detected, and lymph node infiltration was diffuse in all patients. Of 36 patients who received immunophenotypic classifications, 30 had diseases that affected the T-cell system, and the cells of all tested patients with these diseases showed the helper/inducer (T4) phenotype. Twenty-seven of these thirty-six patients were found to have adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, and of the 27, 24 had antibodies to HTLV-I. The median duration of survival in patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma was 17 weeks, but a subgroup of 9 patients had indolent courses and a median survival of 81 weeks, which suggests that the disease has differing expression with courses that range from smoldering and indolent to acute and rapidly fatal. Hypercalcemia was the most important prognostic determinant of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Of 27 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Tucson, Arizona, 7 had concurrent coccidioidomycosis. Early manifestations of infection in 6 patients included diffuse nodular pulmonary infiltrates and Coccidioides immitis in many extrathoracic sites. By comparison, a retrospective review of the cases of 300 patients hospitalized with coccidioidal infection identified only 13 patients without AIDS who had the same extent of infection, and only 3 of these patients had no immunosuppressing conditions. Antibodies for coccidioidal antigens at serum dilutions as high as 1:2048 were detected in 5 of the 7 patients with AIDS. Six had temporary responses to amphotericin B treatment, taken both alone and combined with ketoconazole, but all died within 14 months of their diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis. Because annual rates of coccidioidal infection in the Tucson area are 4% or less, the rate of 27% that we calculated, based on 7 patients having the infection during 26 years of risk for AIDS, suggests frequent reactivation of the infection or enhanced susceptibility to endemic exposure in persons with AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Brain metastases are found at diagnosis in 10% of patients with small cell lung cancer. To clarify the effect of central nervous system metastases on prognosis, the records of 429 patients with small cell lung cancer were reviewed. Forty-three patients (10%) presented with brain metastases. In 18 patients the brain was the only site of metastatic disease, whereas the remaining 25 patients had at least one additional metastatic site. Forty-one of forty-three patients were treated with combination chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy. Systemic response rates were similar for both groups. Twenty-seven patients underwent repeat central nervous system staging: 19 (70%) had a complete response, 4 (15%) a partial response, and 4 (15%) no response. Median survival of patients with only one site of metastatic disease was 11 months; patients with additional sites lived 5 months (p = 0.153). Survival in patients with only one site is similar to that in patients with limited disease (11 compared with 13 months; p = 0.074).\r"
