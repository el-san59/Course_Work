However, the relation between steroid dosage, cumulative dose and type of steroid on one hand and the subsequent formation of cataract on the other is unclear. We carried out a study to determine the incidence of posterior subcapsular cataracts in 64 children who had undergone renal transplantation and to attempt to determine what factors were associated with cataract formation. Cataracts were detected in 17 (26%) of the patients. The steroid dosage, cumulative dose and duration of therapy were not associated with cataract formation. There was a significant difference in the distribution of HLA-CW3 antigen between the patients with cataracts and those without cataracts. The reason for the link between corticosteroid therapy and formation of posterior subcapsular cataracts remains unclear.\r"

The mean onset of action (+/-SEM) of edrophonium (18.1 +/- 2.4 sec) was significantly more rapid (P less than 0.01) than that of neostigmine (47.6 +/- 4 sec), as were the times taken to attain a TOF ratio of 0.25 and 0.5. Nevertheless, the reversal time (time taken from the end of injection of the antagonist until TOF ratio value had reached 0.75) was significantly shorter (P less than 0.01) in the neostigmine than in the edrophonium group (499.3 +/- 62 vs 767 +/- 52 sec respectively). The TOF ratio ten minutes after reversal was greater in the neostigmine group than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01), 0.78 +/- 0.02 vs 0.68 +/- 0.02 min respectively. At that time, 33% (5 out of 15) and 80% (12 out of 15) patients failed to be reversed adequately (TOF ratio of 0.75) after neostigmine 0.06 mg.kg-1 and edrophonium 1 mg.kg-1, respectively. Administration of one additional dose (one-third of the initial dose) of the same antagonist resulted in adequate antagonism in the remaining five patients in the neostigmine group and in nine patients in the edrophonium group. Two such doses were required in the remaining three patients in the latter group. The mean total dose of neostigmine and edrophonium employed in this study was 0.067 +/- 0.002 and 1.3 +/- 0.05 mg.kg-1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group C (Control, n = 10) had received anaesthesia without nondepolarizing muscle relaxant; Group V (n = 25) had received vecuronium; and Group P (n = 29) had received pancuronium. At the end of surgery, each patient had been considered by his anaesthetist to have adequate neuromuscular function on the basis of clinical signs and tactile or visual evaluation of responses to TOF stimulation. However, upon testing in the PACU 15 min later, 45% (13 of 29) of Group P patients and 8% (2 of 25) of Group V patients had a TOF ration less than 0.70. This study indicates that residual curarization may be commonly encountered following long-acting relaxants despite qualitative intraoperative TOF monitoring. The present incidence, detected at a current of 20 mA, is consistent with previous reports which employed supramaximal TOF stimulation. We conclude that despite intraoperative monitoring, residual curarization following long-acting nondepolarizing agents is common and that it may be detected with TOF at a low stimulating current (20 mA).\r"

The drugs were administered via a lumbar epidural catheter one hour before the end of surgery. Efficacy was assessed using visual analogue pain scores and supplementary iv fentanyl requirements; respiratory function was studied with an inductive plethysmograph and arterial blood gas analysis; and plasma nalbuphine levels were measured. Pain scores and fentanyl supplementation were lowest in the morphine group (P less than 0.01). No dose-response effect was apparent in the nalbuphine dose-range studied. Respiratory depression was more common in patients receiving morphine (higher mean PaCO2P less than 0.01, more frequent apnoeas greater than 15 sec P less than 0.05, and incidence of PaCO2 greater than 50 mmHg requiring naloxone P less than 0.01). There were no differences in haemodynamic variables, sedation, or other side-effects among the groups. The pharmacokinetic profile of epidural nalbuphine was similar to that seen with rapid iv injection. The results indicate that, relative to morphine, lumbar epidural nalbuphine is an ineffective analgesic after thoracotomy. Despite the lower incidence of respiratory depression its administration by this route cannot be recommended.\r"

Tracheal anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen, isoflurane, and succinylcholine by infusion. Intraoperatively, patients who received B demonstrated lower pulse rate before and after intubation (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01) and lower diastolic blood pressure after intubation (P less than 0.01). Anesthesiologists judged the maintenance phase as satisfactory more often with B (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively, there were no differences in analgesic need. No major side-effects occurred in either group. Among minor side-effects, patients who received B reported postoperative sedation more often, 77% vs 37% (P less than 0.01), which occurred during the first 45 min of recovery (P less than 0.05). Discharge times were not different. On the first postoperative day, more subjects who received B were satisfied with their anaesthesia experience (P less than 0.05). Butorphanol 20 micrograms.kg-1 is an acceptable alternative analgesic in general anaesthesia for ambulatory laparoscopy.\r"

Each patient had his SaO2 recorded before premedication with placebo (saline), midazolam 0.08 mg.kg-1 or morphine 0.15 mg.kg-1 with perphenazine 2.5-5.0 mg im. From 30-90 min later, prior to anaesthesia SaO2 was repeated, and a sedation score was obtained by a blinded observer using a seven point scale. Median sedation scores were greater for midazolam (4) than for morphine-perphenazine (2) and placebo (1) (P less than 0.0001). As well, there was a decrease in the SaO2 in the morphine-perphenazine group (1.7 +/- 2.7%, P less than 0.001) but not in the midazolam and placebo groups (0.1 +/- 2.3%, -0.8 +/- 2.1%).

Fifteen children with left to right intracardiac shunting of blood (acyanotic group) and 15 children with right to left intracardiac shunting of blood (cyanotic group) were studied and compared with 15 children without CHD (control group). Lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) was injected into a peripheral vein over 30 sec and serial samples of arterial blood were obtained up to 120 min after completion of the infusion. Total and free lidocaine were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. The serum concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) at induction of anaesthesia was measured in the three groups by radial immunodiffusion. The percent free lidocaine (100 x [free lidocaine]/[total lidocaine]) was greater at 30 sec post-infusion in all three groups (35-37%) than it was at any other time but was not significantly different among the three groups (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in either the percent free or the total lidocaine concentration at any sample time or in any of the pharmacokinetic variables among the three groups. The serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP did not differ significantly among the three groups of patients. We conclude that the presence of intracardiac shunts does not alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) in children. The percent free lidocaine is greatest immediately post-injection and this may mitigate against rapid bolus administration of intravenous lidocaine in children.\r"

Esmolol or placebo was administered one minute prior to induction of anaesthesia and exactly two minutes before ECT. Both the 100 and 200 mg bolus doses significantly blunted the maximum increase in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) following ECT in comparison with placebo. Compared with placebo, esmolol 100 mg decreased maximum HR by 23 +/- 3%, maximum MAP by 17 +/- 7% and maximum rate-pressure product (RPP) by 40 +/- 9%. Esmolol 200 mg decreased maximum HR by 25 +/- 3%, maximum MAP by 19 +/- 3% and maximum RPP by 42 +/- 5%. No significant difference was found between the two esmolol doses at corresponding measurement points before and after ECT. Treatment with esmolol 200 mg resulted in a significantly shorter mean seizure duration than with placebo. As the 200 mg dose caused a shorter seizure duration and the haemodynamic effects of 100 mg and 200 mg doses were similar, it was concluded that the 100 mg esmolol bolus dose was the better dose for ECT.\r"

This may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist. We, therefore, investigated the effects of the histamine 1(H1) receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ICU patients. Each patient was studied on two separate days. In a random fashion, they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of diphenhydramine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv. In the non-pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 107.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 86.7 +/- 11.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01) two minutes after cimetidine. Also, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased during the eight-minute observation period (P less than 0.01). In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen. We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine, since the vasodilating activity of cimetidine is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.\r"

In 50 adult volunteers two 22-gauge i.v. catheters and two 24-gauge catheters were placed through the forearm skin into the subcutaneous tissue. One catheter of each size was placed through an entry site created by piercing the skin with an 18-gauge disposable, stainless steel needle. One catheter of each size was inserted through nearby skin without creation of an entry site. Two to three weeks after insertion all catheters, along with 50 catheters of each size that had not been inserted, were examined under a microscope for evidence of damage. Intravenous catheter damage was more prevalent in the 24-gauge catheters than the 22-gauge catheters (P less than 0.05). No differences in frequency of damage were noted for either gauge catheter inserted through an entry site compared with those inserted without a prior skin puncture. Twenty-four-gauge catheters, but not 22-gauge catheters, placed into the subcutaneous tissue were damaged more frequently than were catheters that had never been inserted (control catheters). This study demonstrated that 24-gauge catheters are more likely to be damaged during insertion into the subcutaneous tissue than are 22-gauge catheters. We also demonstrated that creation of a skin entry site by piercing the epidermis with a needle of larger gauge than the catheter to be placed is not efficacious in preventing intravenous catheter damage during insertion.\r"

The surgical correction of microstomia includes separation and cosmetic reconstruction of the fused lips and postoperative oral splinting. Microstomia from lye ingestion may be associated not only with limited mouth opening but also with such severe intraoral scarring that common landmarks guiding either rigid or flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy are obscured, rendering oral and nasotracheal intubation difficult or impossible. We report a case of paediatric microstomia after lye ingestion in which conventional direct laryngoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and multiple blind nasal approaches to tracheal intubation were unsuccessful. However, tracheostomy was avoided and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished using a new rigid tubular pharyngolaryngoscope.\r"

A ten-year-old, previously healthy boy underwent general anaesthesia for detorsion and right orchiopexy.

Twenty-two hours postoperatively he was found unconscious with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Simultaneously obtained serum sodium concentration (121 mEq.L-1) serum osmolarity (265 mEq.L-1), urine sodium concentration (87 mEq.L-1) and urine osmolarity (525 mEq.L-1) suggested inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion which was confirmed by an elevated serum arginine-vasopressin (AVP) level of 14.5 pcg.ml-1 (normal 1-5 pcg.ml-1) measured by radioimmune assay. He was treated with a single iv dose of 30 mg furosemide and fluid restriction, which produced a gradual increase of his serum sodium concentration to normal within two days.

The clinical course is characterized by an unusual presentation with abdominal pain, and manifestations of inadequate haemostasis and excessive bleeding are common. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality are high. We report our experience with 33 patients over a five-year period. The mean gestational age (GA) of the pregnancies was 34 +/- 2.8 wk including 11 patients who delivered 12 neonates of less than 34 wk GA. The most common presenting complaints were right upper quadrant or epigastric pain in 25 patients (76%) and nausea or vomiting in 14 patients (42%). Diagnosis was missed or delayed in 12 patients (36%). Thirty-one patients (94%) were delivered by Caesarean section and a deteriorating maternal condition was the most common indication for operative delivery. Twenty-three patients received general anaesthesia, eight received epidural anaesthesia and there were no complications related to the anaesthetic. There was clinical evidence of abnormal haemostasis: seven patients had excessive blood loss at Caesarean section, two had postpartum haemorrhage, three developed DIC and four developed wound haematoma. The average decrease in haemoglobin concentration was 32 g.L-1 and twelve patients (36%) received blood transfusions. There was one stillbirth. There were no neonatal deaths but morbidity was prominent and related primarily to prematurity. Delayed or missed diagnosis is common in HELLP syndrome and a premature delivery by Caesarean section is usual.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rapid reduction of increased CSF pressure caused CBF to increase to 61.5 +/- 19.1 ml.100 g-1.min-1, whereas MAP, MPAP, PAWP, and SVRI decreased by 22 +/- 11 mmHg, 2.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg, 2.3 +/- 2.0 mmHg, and 1289 +/- 1237 dynes.sec.cm-5.m2 from previous values (P less than 0.01) at 30 min following the decompression. However, cardiac index and pulmonary vascular resistance index remained unchanged during the study period. The present animal data indicate that the decrease in MAP after decompression is mainly a result of a reduction in systemic vascular resistance.\r"

MAC was also determined in five dogs before and during infusion of the drug vehicle (10 microliters.kg-1.min-1). Nimodipine produced a reduction in MAC from 1.47 +/- 0.33% to 1.19 +/- 0.18, 1.15 +/- 0.18 and 1.15 +/- 0.09% during infusions of nimodipine 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, respectively (P less than 0.05). Infusion of drug vehicle alone produced no change in MAC (1.39 +/- 0.15%). This reduction in anaesthetic requirement by nimodipine may be due to its effect on neurotransmission. Adjustments in anaesthetic dosage may be necessary in patients receiving nimodipine.\r"

Greater anticoagulant activity can be achieved in vivo with more specific thrombin inhibitors. Heparin may also increase the risk of bleeding by an effect on platelets that is independent of its thrombin inhibitory activity. METHODS AND RESULTS. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of a novel thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, were examined alone and in combination with aspirin in normal male volunteers. Argatroban induced a dose-dependent prolongation of the thrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). aPTT had returned to its pretreatment value 1 hour after stopping the infusion of argatroban. Six male subjects received an infusion of 1 micrograms/kg/min argatroban after the administration of two doses of 162.5 mg aspirin or a matching placebo. At this dose, aspirin decreased serum thromboxane B2 by a mean of 99% and prolonged the bleeding time (230 +/- 52 versus 320 +/- 113 seconds, p less than 0.01). Argatroban given alone increased thrombin time by 454 +/- 18% and aPTT by 160 +/- 3%. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved at 1 hour and declined exponentially with an elimination half-life of 24 +/- 4 minutes. Neither the anticoagulant effects nor the plasma concentrations of argatroban were altered by aspirin. Furthermore, argatroban did not increase the bleeding time when given alone and did not further prolong the bleeding time when combined with aspirin. CONCLUSION. The combination of aspirin and argatroban may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy in the prevention of coronary thrombosis.\r"

Experimental studies have demonstrated that intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation may induce marked vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries with endothelial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS. To examine the effects of intracoronary thrombus formation on coronary vasomotor tone of human epicardial arteries in vivo, we studied 15 patients who developed intracoronary thrombi adherent to the guide wire during balloon dilatation. Epicardial artery luminal area was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography proximal and distal to the site of intracoronary thrombus formation and in a reference vessel before and after thrombus formation as well as after intracoronary injection of 0.2-0.3 mg nitroglycerin. All artery segments distal to the site of thrombus formation showed vasoconstriction with a luminal area reduction of -27.4 +/- 17.1% (p less than 0.001), whereas proximal vessel segments and reference vessels not manipulated during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty did not demonstrate any significant luminal area changes during thrombus formation. Angiographic measurements after advancing the guide wire with the adherent thrombus (performed in six of the 15 patients) revealed in all patients that vasoconstriction did develop at a new site distal to the thrombus persistence of the initial vasoconstriction now residing proximal to the thrombus. Thus, there was a sequential association between thrombus formation and subsequent distal vasoconstriction. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin abolished the thrombus-induced vasoconstriction. No significant luminal area changes were observed in 20 patients without angiographic evidence of intracoronary thrombus formation. CONCLUSIONS. Intracoronary thrombus formation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty causes focal vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries in patients with coronary artery disease. Although caution must be advised in the extrapolation of this phenomenon, which was observed in a manipulated artery during coronary angioplasty, the vasoconstrictor response to intracoronary thrombus formation in vivo may play an important role in the dynamic mechanisms of acute coronary heart disease syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The efficacy of aspirin for prevention of thrombotic graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depends both on the dosage and time window of administration. Early and late graft patency were therefore assessed in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin, 324 mg daily, given within 1 hour of CABG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Angiographic graft patency was determined at 1 week (231 patients) and 1 year (219 patients) after CABG. The early vein graft occlusion rate was 1.6% on aspirin and 6.2% on placebo (p = 0.004), and late graft occlusion rate was 5.8% on continued aspirin and 11.6% on placebo (p = 0.01). New graft occlusion between 1 week and 1 year was less common in patients on aspirin than on placebo (4.3% versus 7.4%, p = 0.013). The protective effect of aspirin against occlusion persisted in most subgroups of graft type, graft flow, diameter of recipient artery, location of grafted artery, and endarterectomy. Mean chest tube blood loss for the first 24 hours was 571 ml for the aspirin group and 563 ml for the placebo group. Red cell transfusion requirements were 902 ml in the aspirin group and 934 ml in the placebo group (p = NS). The reoperation rate was 4.8% in the aspirin group and 1% in the placebo group (p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. Immediate postoperative administration of aspirin (324 mg) improves early graft patency and, with continued usage, protects against further occlusion up to 1 year after CABG. Postoperative blood loss was similar in the two groups; however, aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant higher rate of reoperation.\r"

To quantify the duration of postexercise hypotension at different exercise intensities, we studied six unmedicated, mildly hypertensive men matched with six normotensive controls. METHODS AND RESULTS. Each subject wore a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor at the same time of day for 13 consecutive hours on 3 different days. On each of the 3 days, subjects either cycled for 30 minutes at 40% or 70% maximum VO2 or performed activities of daily living. There was no intensity effect on the postexercise reduction in blood pressure, so blood pressure data were combined for the different exercise intensities. Postexercise diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were lower by 8 +/- 1 (p less than 0.001) and 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, than the preexercise values for 12.7 hours in the hypertensive group. These variables were not different before and after exercise in the normotensive group. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) for 8.7 hours after exercise in the hypertensive group. In contrast, systolic blood pressure was 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) higher for 12.7 hours after exercise in the normotensive group. When the blood pressure response on the exercise days was compared with that on the nonexercise day, systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 1 versus 145 +/- 1 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (100 +/- 1 versus 106 +/- 1 mm Hg) were lower (p less than 0.05) on the exercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. We found a postexercise reduction in mean arterial pressure for 12.7 hours independent of the exercise intensity in the hypertensive group. Furthermore, mean arterial pressure was lower on exercise than on nonexercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. CONCLUSION. These findings indicate that dynamic exercise may be an important adjunct in the treatment of mild hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Two catheter electrode systems were compared for delivering radiofrequency current for ablation of the atrioventricular junction. Seventeen patients with drug-resistant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were studied. METHODS AND RESULTS. A 6F or 7F catheter with six or eight standard electrodes (1.25 mm wide, 2.5-mm spacing) was used in the first seven patients (group 1). A 7F quadripolar catheter with a large-tip electrode (4 mm long; surface area, 27 mm2) was used in the final 10 patients (group 2). Both ablation catheters were positioned to record a large atrial potential and a small but sharp His bundle potential from the distal bipolar electrode pair. Radiofrequency current was applied between a large skin electrode on the left posterior chest and either 1) each individual electrode on the standard-tip electrode catheter at 40 V (group 1) or 2) the large-tip electrode at 50-60 V (group 2). Radiofrequency current was limited to 40 V in group patients because of the strong potential for an early impedance rise when higher voltage is applied through standard electrodes. Complete atrioventricular block was achieved in six of seven group 1 patients and all 10 group 2 patients. A junctional escape rhythm followed ablation in five or six group 1 patients (mean cycle length, 1,066 +/- 162 msec) and eight of 10 group 2 patients (mean cycle length, 1,281 +/- 231 msec). Atrioventricular block was produced in a mean of 4.7 +/- 4.6 radiofrequency current applications delivered over a period of 42 +/- 45 minutes using the large-tip electrode (group 2) compared with 46 +/- 22 applications using standard electrodes (15.9 +/- 10.2 applications delivered through the standard-tip electrode) over a period of 147 +/- 59 minutes (group 1). For the application producing atrioventricular block, the large-tip electrode used higher voltage (58 +/- 17 versus 38 +/- 5 V, p less than 0.03) and had lower impedance (103 +/- 22 versus 148 +/- 40 omega, p less than 0.01), resulting in greater power (33.0 +/- 13.0 versus 10.2 +/- 0.6 W, p less than 0.003) and shorter time to block (8 +/- 3 versus 22 +/- 3 seconds, p less than 0.001). Current delivery through standard electrodes was limited by an impedance rise occurring 7 +/- 7 seconds after the onset of one or more radiofrequency current applications at 10 +/- 1 W in six of seven patients. Using the large-tip electrode, an impedance rise occurred in five of 10 patients, but at 25 +/- 10 W and after 21 +/- 9 seconds. Atrioventricular block occurred before the impedance rise in three of these five patients. Complete atrioventricular block persisted in 15 of 16 patients at a mean follow-up of 8.7 months. Atrioventricular conduction returned at 1 month in one group 2 patient and was successfully ablated by a second procedure. Three group 1 patients died 0.5-2 months after ablation, and a fourth patient underwent cardiac transplantation after 10 months. Pathological examination of the heart in two of these patients showed necrosis of the atrioventricular node and origin of the His bundle, without injury to the middle or distal His bundle. All 10 group 2 patients are alive and subjectively improved after ablation. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that catheter-delivered radiofrequency current effectively produces complete atrioventricular block (94%) without requiring general anesthesia or the risk of ventricular dysfunction or cardiac perforation. The large-tip electrode allows a threefold increase in delivered power and markedly decreases the number of pulses and time required to produce atrioventricular block.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Conventionally, monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with remote myocardial infarction is believed to originate from the subendocardium. In a previous study, we demonstrated that electrical activation patterns during ventricular tachycardia occasionally suggest a subepicardial rather than subendocardial reentry. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study prospectively evaluated the functional role of the epicardium in postinfarction ventricular tachycardia with complex intraoperative techniques including computerized electrical activation mapping, entrainment, observation of changes in activation pattern during successful epicardial laser photoblation, and histological study. Five of 10 consecutive patients undergoing intraoperative computerized activation mapping had 10 ventricular tachycardia morphologies displaying epicardial diastolic activation These 10 \"epicardial\" ventricular tachycardias revealed the following global activation patterns: monoregional spread (two), figure-eight activation (five), and circular macroreentry (three). Entrainment of ventricular tachycardia using epicardial stimulation was successfully performed from an area of slow diastolic conduction in four tachycardia morphologies. During entrainment, global activation remained undisturbed with recordings showing a long stimulus to QRS interval, unchanged QRS morphology, and pacing capture of all components of the reentry circuit. Neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser photocoagulation was delivered during ventricular tachycardia to epicardial sites of presumed reentry. Epicardial photoablation terminated five of five figure-eight tachycardias, two of three circular macroreentry tachycardias but not the monoregional tachycardias. Electrophysiological recordings during epicardial laser photocoagulation demonstrated progressive prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length and apparent interruption of the presumed reentrant circuit. Histological evaluation of the reentrant region (three patients) showed a rim of surviving myocardium under the epicardial surface. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that 1) chronic postinfarction ventricular tachycardia may result from subepicardial macroreentry, 2) slow conduction within the reentry circuit can be localized by computerized mapping and epicardial entrainment, and 3) ventricular tachycardia interruption by laser photocoagulation results from conduction delay and block within critical elements of the reentrant pathway. Viable subepicardial muscle fibers may constitute the underlying pathology.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an inherited primary cardiac abnormality characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, is the leading cause of sudden death in the young. Recent application of restriction fragment length polymorphism markers has provided provocative results, with localization to chromosome 18 (Japanese studies), 16 (Italian studies), 14 (US and French-Canadian studies), and two (National Institutes of Health studies) indicating genetic heterogeneity. Interpretation remains speculative until at least one of these loci is confirmed in unrelated pedigrees by independent investigators. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied eight unrelated families of varied ethnic origins across the United States. DNA from each individual was digested with restriction enzymes TaqI or BamHI and analyzed by Southern blots followed by hybridization with probes T cell receptor alpha (TCRA), myosin heavy chain beta, D14S25, and D14S26. Multipoint linkage analysis showed a maximum lod score of 4.3, placing the locus 10 cM from D14S26 between D14S26 and TCRA, with an odds ratio of 20,000:1 and 90% confidence limits of 12 cM proximal to D14S25 to 4 cM distal to TCRA. The probability of linkage to 14q1 was more than 99%. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that the loci for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in our families is primarily 14q1 but does not exclude other loci in a small proportion of the families. Thus, 14q1 appears to be the locus for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a significant proportion of the US population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has been shown to adversely affect short-term prognoses in patients with unstable angina, after myocardial infarction, and with chronic stable angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this long-term study, we followed 138 patients (mean age, 59 +/- 9 years) with chronic stable angina and positive exercise tests for cardiac events (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). In 105 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after all antianginal medication was withheld for 48 hours. In 26 patients, the diagnostic tests were repeated while on their usual medication. In addition to the 105 patients, 33 patients had their monitoring performed only while on their usual medication. During 37 +/- 17 months of follow-up, there were nine deaths, nine myocardial infarctions, and 35 revascularization procedures. In patients monitored off medication, Cox survival analysis showed that the occurrence of ischemia on electrocardiographic monitoring was the most significant predictor of death and myocardial infarction in the subsequent 2 years (p = 0.02) and all adverse events for 5 years (p = 0.009). Patients who were monitored on medication and did not have ischemia (n = 18) appeared to have more adverse events than patients who had no ischemia while being monitored off medication (n = 43). CONCLUSIONS. Asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with stable angina predicts death and myocardial infarction for 2 years and all adverse events for 5 years. Monitoring performed while on medication may show no ischemia; however, this may not indicate low risk of future coronary events.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed during dobutamine infusion has been proposed as a potentially useful method for detecting coronary artery disease. However, the safety and diagnostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this study, echocardiograms were recorded during step-wise infusion of dobutamine to a maximum dose of 30 micrograms/kg/min in 103 patients who also underwent quantitative coronary angiography. The echocardiograms were digitally stored and displayed in a format that allowed simultaneous analysis of rest and stress images. Development of a new abnormality in regional function was used as an early end point for the dobutamine infusion. No patient had a symptomatic arrhythmia or complications from stress-induced ischemia. Significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 35 of 55 patients who had normal echocardiograms at rest. The sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine-induced wall motion abnormalities for coronary artery disease was 89% (31 of 35) and 85% (17 of 20), respectively. The sensitivity was 81% (17 of 21) in those with one-vessel disease and 100% (14 of 14) in those with multivessel or left main disease. Forty-one of 48 patients with abnormal echocardiograms at baseline had localized rest wall motion abnormalities. Fifteen had coronary artery disease confined to regions that had abnormal rest wall motion, and 26 had disease remote from these regions. Thirteen of 15 patients (87%) without remote disease did not develop remote stress-induced abnormalities, and 21 of 26 (81%) who had remote disease developed corresponding abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS. Echocardiography combined with dobutamine infusion is a safe and accurate method for detecting coronary artery disease and for predicting the extent of disease in those who have localized rest wall motion abnormalities.\r"

This study examined the value of technetium-99m-Sestamibi tomographic imaging to assess myocardial perfusion in patients during chest pain without ST elevation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Tc-99m-Sestamibi was injected in 14 patients who had chest pain without ST elevation, who subsequently developed enzymatic evidence of myocardial infarction within 24 hours. Tomographic imaging was performed 1-6 hours after injection. Thirteen of 14 patients showed significant perfusion defects indicative of acute myocardial infarction consistent with absent perfusion (20 +/- 15% of the left ventricle; range, 2-53%); one patient had normal images. Because of the absence of definitive electrocardiographic changes, only five patients received reperfusion therapy within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain. Regional wall motion abnormalities were present in nine of nine patients undergoing contrast ventriculography and correlated with the location of the Tc-99m-Sestamibi perfusion defect. At the time of subsequent coronary angiography, total arterial occlusion was present in 11 of the 14 patients. The infarct-related artery could be identified in 13 of the 14 patients. In six of these 13 patients, the left circumflex was the infarct-related artery. CONCLUSIONS. Patients who have chest pain without electrocardiographic ST elevation may have arterial occlusion and significant myocardium at risk. Tc-99m-Sestamibi imaging may be of benefit in identifying these patients early so that they can be considered for acute reperfusion therapy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acceleration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) are still unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. High-resolution epicardial mapping was used to study the mechanisms of VT acceleration by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in a model of sustained reentrant VT in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 40). Three different mechanisms responsible for acceleration of VT were identified: 1) induction of double-wave reentry (n = 6), defined as the occurrence of two successive activation waves circulating in the same direction in the same circuit; 2) change to a functionally determined circuit (n = 4), defined as reentry of the impulse around a functional line of block without involvement of a fixed obstacle; and 3) change of the reentrant circuit to reentry within a different, faster anatomic pathway (n = 3). Analysis of 81 episodes of sustained monomorphic VT induced by PES in 74 patients with clinically documented sustained VT in the setting of chronic coronary artery disease showed that in 22 episodes VT was suddenly accelerated by PES (mean cycle length, from 345 +/- 73 to 277 +/- 71 msec, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. With the observations made in the experimental model, the following tentative classification of the mechanisms of VT acceleration of the 22 episodes was made: 1) induction of double-wave reentry in two, 2) change to a functionally determined circuit in four, and 3) change to reentry within a faster anatomic circuit in 16. Simple criteria suggest that these mechanisms may apply in the clinical situation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Valvular heart disease is associated with a decreased platelet circulating time and a thrombotic tendency. The possibility that these events are related to changes in von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein released from endothelial cells and platelets that mediates platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, has not been examined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured the vWF antigen (vWF:Ag) concentration in 43 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of mitral (n = 17) or aortic (n = 10) stenosis or nonvalvular heart disease (n = 16). Mean vWF:Ag concentration was significantly higher in patients with mitral stenosis than in those without (212 +/- 84 versus 150 +/- 79 units/dl, p less than 0.02); this elevation was associated with a significant elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the patients with mitral stenosis (186 +/- 49 versus 133 +/- 81 dynes-sec-cm-5, p less than 0.02). The vWF:Ag levels in the entire group of patients (regardless of the presence or type of valvular disease) varied directly with PVR (r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001) and with pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001) and inversely with cardiac output (r = 0.64, p less than 0.0001). Changes in PVR, pulmonary artery pressure, or cardiac output could not be correlated with circulating levels of fibrinogen or beta-thromboglobulin, which may be released from activated platelets, nor with the endothelial cell product tissue plasminogen activator. CONCLUSIONS. The association of high vWF:Ag levels with increased PVR and decreased cardiac output in patients both with and without mitral stenosis suggests a hemodynamically induced increase in the endothelial release of vWF, which might contribute to a thrombotic tendency in these patients.\r"

Identification of the spectral and temporal features in ECGs that distinguish patients prone to ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a prerequisite to implementing refinements in methods that increase the diagnostic power of the signal-averaged ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fast Fourier transforms and time-domain reconstructions based on inverse fast Fourier transforms were computed over the entire cardiac cycle of signal-averaged ECGs of sinus beats from 40 patients with myocardial infarction and sustained VT, 41 with infarction without VT, and 20 normal controls. Ventricular depolarization and repolarization were analyzed by procedures that obviate limited resolution due to short data segments and window functions. Spectral magnitudes of ECGs from patients in each group were compared, and the phase data were used for time-domain reconstructions to determine the temporal distributions of distinguishing frequency bands during the cardiac cycle. Magnitudes of 1-7-Hz frequencies were increased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001), and magnitudes of 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequencies were decreased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001) in the spectra of ECGs from patients with VT compared with patients without VT. Time-domain reconstructions demonstrated that 1-7-Hz frequencies were detectable throughout the QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave in ECGs from each group. The 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequency bands not only contributed to the terminal QRS and ST segment but were also detectable throughout the QRS complex of ECGs from patients with VT. CONCLUSIONS. Results define new spectral and temporal features in signal-averaged ECGs from patients with VT that are excluded from analysis by available techniques that limit the bandwidth or restrict interrogation to portions of the cardiac cycle. These findings provide an objective basis for developing new indexes for signal-averaged ECG analysis.\r"

Therefore, we investigated the reasons for failure of presently available criteria, and we identified new, simpler criteria and incorporated them in a stepwise approach that provides better sensitivity and specificity for making a correct diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. A prospective analysis revealed that current criteria had a poor specificity for the differential diagnosis. The value of four new criteria incorporated in a stepwise approach was prospectively analyzed in a total of 554 tachycardias with a widened QRS complex (384 ventricular and 170 supraventricular). The sensitivity of the four consecutive steps was 0.987, and the specificity was 0.965. CONCLUSIONS. Current criteria for the differential diagnosis between supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction and ventricular tachycardia are frequently absent or suggest the wrong diagnosis. The absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads is easily recognizable and highly specific for the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. When an RS complex is present in one or more precordial leads, an RS interval of more than 100 msec is highly specific for ventricular tachycardia. This new stepwise approach may prevent diagnostic mistakes.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Exercise-induced abnormalities during thallium-201 scintigraphy that normalize at rest frequently occur in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are indicative of myocardial ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent exercise 201Tl scintigraphy and, during the same week, measurement of myocardial lactate metabolism and hemodynamics during pacing stress. Thirty-seven patients (74%) had one or more 201Tl abnormalities that completely normalized after 3 hours of rest; 26 had regional myocardial 201Tl defects, and 26 had apparent left ventricular cavity dilatation with exercise, with 15 having coexistence of these abnormal findings. Of the 37 patients with reversible 201Tl abnormalities, 27 (73%) had metabolic evidence of myocardial ischemia during rapid atrial pacing (myocardial lactate extraction of 0 mmol/l or less) compared with four of 13 patients (31%) with normal 201Tl scans (p less than 0.01). Eleven patients had apparent cavity dilatation as their only 201Tl abnormality; their mean postpacing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher than that of the 13 patients with normal 201Tl studies (33 +/- 5 versus 21 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the angiographic presence of systolic septal or epicardial coronary arterial compression and the presence or distribution of 201Tl abnormalities. Patients with ischemic ST segment responses to exercise had an 80% prevalence rate of reversible 201Tl abnormalities and a 70% prevalence rate of pacing-induced ischemia. However, 69% of patients with nonischemic ST segment responses had reversible 201Tl abnormalities, and 55% had pacing-induced ischemia. CONCLUSIONS. Reversible 201Tl abnormalities during exercise stress are markers of myocardial ischemia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and most likely identify relatively underperfused myocardium. In contrast, ST segment changes with exercise and systolic compression of coronary arteries on angiography are unreliable markers of inducible myocardial ischemia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Apparent cavity dilatation during 201Tl scintigraphy may indicate ischemia-related changes in left ventricular filling, with elevation in diastolic pressures and endocardial compression.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Adenosine is an effective hypotensive agent in experimental animals and in anesthetized patients, producing little if any evidence of reflex sympathetic activation. In contrast, adenosine increases systolic blood pressure and heart rate in conscious subjects. To determine whether this response is related to sympathetic activation, we studied the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of adenosine in normal subjects while measuring muscle sympathetic nerve traffic through direct recordings from a peroneal nerve. METHODS AND RESULTS. Adenosine (80 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) increased heart rate (+32 +/- 3 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (+10 +/- 2 mm Hg), and minute ventilation (+7 +/- 1 l/min). This was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (from 198 +/- 52 to 451 +/- 92 units/min). Adenosine also produced a small, but consistent, decrease in diastolic blood pressure (-6 +/- 3 mm Hg). Adenosine produced a greater increase in sympathetic nerve traffic (145 +/- 32% above baseline) than did nitroprusside (65 +/- 16%) at doses that resulted in equivalent decreased in diastolic blood pressure. Arterial baroreceptor unloading, therefore, could not totally explain the increase in sympathetic traffic produced by adenosine. CONCLUSIONS. Given the constellation of findings of increased ventilation and sympathetic activity, we, therefore, propose that adenosine increases sympathetic tone by activating afferent nerves, including arterial chemoreceptors. Contrary to the known inhibitory actions of adenosine on central and peripheral efferent systems, this and other reports suggest that adenosine-induced activation of afferent nerves, leading to sympathetic activation, may be a more widespread phenomenon than previously recognized.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Left ventricular (LV) midwall geometry has been described conventionally as the sum of the chamber radius and half of the wall thickness; this convention is based on the assumption of uniform transmural thickening during systole. However, theoretical considerations and experimental data indicate that the inner half (inner shell) of the LV wall thickens more than the outer half (outer shell). Thus, an end-diastolic circumferential midwall fiber exhibits a relative migration toward the epicardium during systole. As a result, the conventional method provides an overestimate of the extent of the midwall fiber shortening. METHODS AND RESULTS. We developed an ellipsoidal model with a concentric two-shell geometry (nonuniform thickening) to assess midwall fiber length transients throughout the cardiac cycle. This modified midwall method was used in the analysis of LV cineangiograms from 15 patients with systemic arterial hypertension and 14 normal subjects. Study groups were classified according to LV mass index (LVMI): 14 normal subjects (group I), eight hypertensive patients with a normal LVMI (group II), and seven hypertensive patients with an increased LVMI (group III). There were no significant differences in LV end-diastolic pressure or volume among the three groups; the ejection fraction was slightly greater in group II (70 +/- 5%) than in groups I (65 +/- 8%) and III (66 +/- 4%), but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. Values for endocardial and conventional midwall fractional shortening (FS) were also similar in the three groups. By contrast, FS by the concentric two-shell geometry (modified midwall method) in group III (16 +/- 2%) was significantly less than that seen in groups I and II (21 +/- 4% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively; both p less than 0.05). This difference achieves greater importance when it is recognized that mean systolic circumferential stress was lower in group III (151 +/- 22 g/cm2) than in groups I and II (244 +/- 37 g/cm2 and 213 +/- 38 g/cm2, respectively; both p less than 0.01). The midwall stress-shortening coordinates in six of the seven group III patients were outside the 95% confidence limits for the normal (group I) subjects. Thus, despite a normal ejection fraction, systolic function is subnormal in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS. Chamber dynamics provide an overestimate of myocardial function, especially when LV wall thickness is increased. This is due to a relatively greater contribution of inner shell thickening in pressure-overload hypertrophy.\r"

The present study addressed the effect of tobacco use on the formation of two eicosanoids, thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, which have been implicated in both acute and chronic cardiovascular disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 577 randomly sampled 18-19-year-old men, the urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin (Tx-M and PGI-M, respectively) was analyzed and related to the subjects' self-reported use of tobacco. Sixty-five percent of the subjects used no tobacco, 7.5% were cigarette smokers, 22% used wet (oral) snuff, and the rest reported a mixed use of tobacco. The urinary excretion of Tx-M was higher (p less than 0.001) in cigarette smokers than in those not using tobacco (180 versus 128 pg/mg creatinine) and was correlated (r = 0.35, p less than 0.05) with the daily cigarette consumption. Snuff users had no increase in their urinary excretion of Tx-M, despite urinary cotinine levels comparable to those in the cigarette smokers (1,210 and 1,560 ng/ml, respectively). The excretion of PGI-M did not differ between non-tobacco users, cigarette smokers, and snuff users. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that cigarette smoking, but not the use of snuff, facilitates the formation of thromboxane A2. We propose that such an increased formation reflects platelet activation in the absence of vascular injury and that it may be of significance for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Active oxygen species can influence vascular tone and platelet activation through a variety of mechanisms. This study assessed the role of the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide in vasoconstriction and mural thrombosis after coronary artery angioplasty in intact dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Injury was induced by inflation of a balloon catheter 50 +/- 6% above baseline arterial diameter; dogs were followed for 2 hours before death. Epicardial coronary diameters at arteriography and extent of thrombus deposition at serial histological sections were analyzed in controls (n = 20) and in dogs pretreated with superoxide dismutase (SOD, a superoxide radical scavenger, n = 10); other dogs were pretreated with the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase (n = 8), the iron chelator deferoxamine (n = 6), or the hydroxyl radical scavenger 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (n = 9). Angioplasty-induced injury was similar among groups. After angioplasty, control dogs exhibited localized and persistent vessel constriction, which was maximal at the initial 5 minutes (28.9 +/- 6.3% diameter decrease versus baseline). Corresponding arterial diameters of SOD-treated dogs were 24-69% larger (95% confidence interval, p less than 0.001) than controls at 5 minutes and, on average, 32% larger than controls thereafter (p less than 0.01). Vasoconstriction was not prevented by the other treatments. The SOD dose used accounted for inhibition of zymosan-stimulated blood cytochrome c reduction versus baseline (7 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 6 nmol/min/10(6) cells, respectively, p = 0.003); such inhibition occurred in no other group. Prevalence of mural thrombosis was similar among all groups, but large thrombi (greater than 15% of lumen area) were absent in SOD-treated dogs, contrary to control group (p = 0.028); other groups were similar to control. In the absence of injury, SOD alone induced no change in coronary diameter, coronary blood flow, or platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS. These data provide evidence implicating the superoxide radical in the genesis of vasoconstriction after coronary angioplasty in vivo. Such effects seem to be independent of its conversion to hydroxyl radicals and availability of hydrogen peroxide or catalytic iron complexes.\r"

  ".U": "91215763\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Recently, we used a custom designed \"jacket\" electrode with 127 bipolar electrodes in a flexible nylon matrix to map the total atrial epicardial surface in the in situ canine heart. Atrial flutter in dogs with sterile pericarditis was shown to be due to a single wave front circulating around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc of functional conduction block contiguous with one or more of the atrial vessels. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, this model was used to analyze the activation pattern during pacing-induced entrainment and termination of single reentrant loops in a syncytium without anatomically predetermined pathways. Sustained atrial flutter was induced in five dogs with 3-5-day-old sterile pericarditis. Atrial pacing at a cycle length 5-30 msec shorter than the spontaneous cycle length entrained the arrhythmia and could result in a \"classical\" activation pattern, characterized by an antidromic stimulated wave that collided with the reentrant orthodromic wave front of the previous beat at a constant site. However, two variations of this classical activation pattern were also observed: 1) Pacing at short cycle lengths could lead to localized conduction block in antidromic direction, forcing a change in the pathway of the antidromic wave front. This could prevent the expected shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. 2) The stimulated orthodromic wave front could also use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant impulse, so that a different circuit was active during the pacing period. Termination of atrial flutter by rapid atrial stimulation was associated with progressive slowing and finally blocking of the paced orthodromic wave front and a progressive shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. The occurrence of conduction block was determined by the cycle length of stimulation and the number of stimulated beats. A longer train at the critical cycle length or the critical number of beats at a shorter cycle length could reinduce the same reentrant circuit or a different reentrant circuit, respectively, during stimulated cycles following the beat that terminated reentry. CONCLUSIONS. The epicardial activation sequence during entrainment of reentrant arrhythmias does not necessarily follow a standard activation pattern. Instead, the stimulated orthodromic as well as the antidromic wave front might use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant wave front. The mechanisms of termination, failure of termination, and reinitiation of single-loop reentry are similar to those in the \"figure-eight\" reentrant circuit.\r"

Doppler ultrasound has been used to assess abdominal aortic and umbilical blood flows in the human fetus, but the accuracy of this approach has not been demonstrated in an animal model. METHODS AND RESULTS. We compared abdominal aortic and umbilical blood flows determined by Doppler echocardiography in 12 fetal lambs with invasive flow measurements using radionuclide-labeled microspheres and electromagnetic flow transducers. We varied fetal blood flow from 100 to 950 ml/min in the abdominal aorta and from 130 to 610 ml/min in the umbilical vein. Invasive and Doppler echocardiographic flow measurements correlated well at both sites (y = 68 + 1.02x, r = 0.94, and y = 33 + 1.1x, r = 0.91, respectively). A slight overestimation of flow using the Doppler method may require a correction factor to assess actual flow. The degree of overestimation was not systematically related to measurements taken in smaller vessels or at larger angles of incidence. CONCLUSIONS. The present study demonstrates that determination of abdominal aortic and umbilical venous flows by echocardiography and pulsed Doppler ultrasound is feasible. Doppler measurements appear to be suited to serial comparison of actual flow.\r"

Extracellular potentials associated with electrical activity in the SAB and PAVB were identified in electrograms using adult canine atrial preparations in which the AV node (AVN) and distal AV (His) bundle (DAVB) had been exposed. Intracellular potentials and/or electrograms of the sinoatrial node (SAN), SAB, PAVB, AVN, DAVB, and atrial contractions from a pectinate muscle bundle in the high right atrial wall were recorded. The electrograms contained deflections representing discharge of the specific tissues and atrial potentials from the adjacent or overlying atrial contractile myocardium. In superfusates containing 2.7 mM K+, sequential discharge of the tissues resulted in brief SAN-SAB, PAVB-DAVB, and AVN-DAVB intervals and a major delay after discharge of the SAB. The delay was attributed to activation of the PAVB, as reflected in extracellular PAVB potentials of long duration. Atrial potentials and the onset of the contractile event followed discharge of the SAN and SAB but preceded activation of the PAVB, AVN, and DAVB. After transection of the PAVB-AVN connections, the AVN exhibited automaticity, but the SAB, PAVB, atrial potentials in all of the electrograms, and atrial contractions persisted at the sinus rate. During exposure to 10 mM K+, atrial potentials in all of the electrograms and atrial contractions ceased, indicating electrical quiescence of the contractile myocardium; however, the unique pattern of discharge of the SAB, PAVB, AVN, and DAVB persisted at the SA nodal rate. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, the SAB and PAVB can be classified as specialized conducting tissues and are intrinsic components of the internodal conductile pathway.\r"

  ".W": "We noninvasively measured changes in average aortic stiffness in 79 cynomolgus monkeys being fed cholesterol progression, regression, and control diets by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 260 experiments during a 30-month period. Every 6 months, a group of monkeys was studied with invasive aortic PWV techniques and with ultrasonically determined pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep) of the carotid artery, and then the group was killed so that morphometric evaluation of atherosclerosis severity could be made. After 6 months of a cholesterol progression diet, PWV decreased slightly from 6.2 +/- 0.1 to 5.7 +/- 0.1 m/sec, followed by an approximate linear increase to 8.8 +/- 1.2 m/sec after 30 months on the diet. The corresponding ratio of intimal (plaque) area to medial area (IA/MA) measured on perfusion-fixed cross-sections of the abdominal and thoracic aortas increased from 0.16 +/- 0.07 at 6 months to 1.23 +/- 0.22 at 30 months. Monkeys in the regression groups were fed the cholesterol progression diet for 18 months, followed by a chow diet for 6 or 12 months. In the first 6 months of the cholesterol regression diet, PWV continued to increase from 7.0 +/- 0.2 to 8.1 +/- 0.4 m/sec, and IA/MA was 1.24 +/- 0.18. However, after 12 months of the cholesterol regression diet, PWV decreased to 6.8 +/- 0.4 m/sec, and IA/MA was 0.90 +/- 0.18. The variability of the data demonstrates that PWV is not a simple function of atherosclerosis severity, and the best simple correlation was r = 0.69 (r2 = 0.48) between PWV and intimal area. However, multiple regression analysis of aortic PWV, systolic (SP) and diastolic (DP) blood pressures, and total plasma cholesterol concentration (TPC), all of which can be measured with minimally invasive techniques, improved the prediction of the IA/MA ratio through the following equation: IA/MA = 0.127 PWV-0.039 DP+0.023SP+0.0003TPC-0.292 (r = 0.81, r2 = 0.66). These data suggest that arterial stiffness in combination with minimally invasive parameters can be used to predict the severity of diffuse asymptomatic atherosclerosis in monkeys. However, more widespread application of these data to humans is uncertain because of biological variability and differences between animal models and human subjects.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although thrombosis associated with a fissured atherosclerotic plaque is believed to be the most common cause of acute coronary syndromes, the underlying factors that trigger plaque rupture are currently unknown. However, the mechanical behavior of the plaque is probably of critical importance. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of a plaque are dependent on its composition and, in particular, that the stiffness of fibrous caps changes within the range of frequencies carried by a physiological pressure wave, the stress-strain relation was studied in 27 fibrous caps and related to the underlying histological structure of the fibrous cap. Fibrous caps were obtained during 14 autopsies from the abdominal aorta and were classified by histological examination as cellular (n = 7), hypocellular (n = 9), or calcified (n = 11). Hypocellular fibrous caps were 1-2 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005), and calcified caps were 4-5 times stiffer than cellular caps (p less than 0.005). All 27 fibrous caps demonstrated an increase in stiffness with increasing frequencies of stress ranging from 0.05 to 10 Hz; the increase in stiffness was similar in all three histological classes. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the stiffness of fibrous caps from human atherosclerotic plaques is related to the underlying histological structure and that the stiffness increases with frequency in the range of physiological heart rates. The protective benefit of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents in coronary artery disease may, in part, be related to the frequency dependence of atherosclerotic plaque stiffness.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In genetic and acquired hypertension, a structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment of the myocardium, including the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the interstitium and adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries and a medial thickening of these vessels, represents a determinant of pathological hypertrophy that leads to ventricular dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS. To evaluate the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in reversing this interstitial and vascular remodeling in the rat with genetic spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we treated 14-week-old male SHR with oral lisinopril (average dose, 15 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to adenosine (800 micrograms/min) were examined in the isolated heart; myocardial collagen and intramural coronary artery architecture were analyzed morphometrically. In lisinopril-treated SHR compared with 14-week-old baseline or 26-week-old untreated SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, we found 1) a regression in LVH and normalization of blood pressure, 2) a complete regression of interstitial fibrosis, represented by a decrease of interstitial collagen volume fraction from 7.0 +/- 1.3% to 3.2 +/- 0.3% (p less than 0.025; WKY, 2.8 +/- 0.5%), 3) normalization of myocardial stiffness constant from 19.5 +/- 0.9 to 13.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 13.8 +/- 2.2), 4) a reversal of intramural coronary artery remodeling, including a decrease in the ratio of perivascular fibrosis to vessel lumen size from 1.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 0.6 +/- 0.1) and medial thickening from 12.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.5 microns (p less than 0.005; WKY, 7.4 +/- 0.4 microns), and 4) a restoration of coronary vasodilator response to adenosine from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 26.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min/g (p less than 0.005; WKY, 21.8 +/- 2.2 ml/min/g). Thus, in SHR with LVH and adverse structural remodeling of the cardiac interstitium, lisinopril reversed fibrous tissue accumulation and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries and restored myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to normal. CONCLUSIONS. These cardioreparative properties of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be valuable in reversing left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Intracoronary stents may be effective when used as \"bail-out\" devices for acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Furthermore, preliminary reports have demonstrated some promising results with stents with regard to the reduction of restenosis. Several stent devices are available for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The use of these stainless-steel stents has been limited by poor visibility during fluoroscopy and thrombogenicity during the first days to weeks after implantation. We therefore investigated the immediate and short-term effects on arterial patency of a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable coil stent in normal coronary arteries of pigs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 animals, a stent was placed in two of the three epicardial coronary arteries. During the implantation procedure, the animals received heparin; after the procedure, no antithrombotic drugs were administered. After 1 week (five animals and 10 stents) or 4 weeks (five animals and 10 stents), repeat angiography was performed, followed by pressure-fixation of the coronary arteries for light and electron microscopic examination. Angiographic analysis revealed that all stented coronary segments were patent and without signs of intraluminal defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial covering of all stents within 7 days. Light microscopy showed a reduced tunica media locally under the stent wires, which resulted from exerted pressure. The neointima on top of the stent wires measured 56 microns (range, 42-88 microns) after 1 week and 139 microns (range, 84-250 microns) after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that this radiopaque endoprosthesis can be safely placed in normal coronary arteries of pigs. After 4 weeks, all stents were patent and there was no need for additional antithrombotic treatment, whereas neointimal proliferation was limited.\r"

We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects of cocaine administered as a series of 5-mg/kg i.v. boluses coupled with a continuous infusion in anesthetized dogs. Sodium bicarbonate (50 meq i.v.) was administered as a potential antidote in 11 of 15 dogs, and intravenous 5% dextrose was given in the remaining four. In a dose-dependent fashion, cocaine significantly decreased blood pressure, coronary blood flow, and cardiac output; increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals and sinus cycle length; and increased ventricular effective refractory period and dispersion of ventricular refractoriness. No afterdepolarizations were noted in the monophasic action potential recording. Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously in two dogs, and sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced by programmed stimulation at the end of the dosing protocol in five of 11 animals. Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaine-induced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables. In one dog, sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with reversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose cocaine possesses negative inotropic and potent type I electrophysiological effects. Sodium bicarbonate selectively reversed cocaine-induced QRS prolongation and may be a useful treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with slowed ventricular conduction in the setting of cocaine overdose.\r"

Several studies have established endothelin as a systemic, renal, and coronary vasoconstrictor in vivo at pharmacological concentrations. Such concentrations of endothelin were antinatriuretic in association with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recent studies have demonstrated that endothelin is present in the plasma and that its plasma concentrations are increased in various pathological states associated with systemic and renal vasoconstriction. To date, it remains unclear if such increases in circulating endothelin are associated with biological activity. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the biological action of endothelin on cardiorenal and endocrine function through administration of exogenous endothelin, which achieves plasma concentrations that have been reported in various pathophysiological conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Experiments were conducted in two groups of anesthetized dogs. In group 1, endothelin-1 was infused intravenously at 2.5 ng/kg/ml (n = 6), which produced a doubling of circulating concentrations. Group 2 (n = 8) received saline vehicle to serve as a time control. The current studies demonstrate that a twofold increase in plasma endothelin concentrations did not affect mean blood pressure or coronary blood flow. Heart rate and cardiac output decreased in association with increased renal and systemic vascular resistances and antinatriuresis. CONCLUSIONS. The present studies demonstrate that endothelin at pathophysiological plasma concentrations produced by exogenous endothelin has biological action. These studies support a functional role for endogenous endothelin as a potentially pathophysiological vasoconstrictor peptide hormone in the regulation of cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine function.\r"

The time-intensity curves generated by sequential videodensitometric analysis of contrast intensity, which is corrected for myocardial background intensity, resembles the curves used in indicator dilution techniques. Studies done in vitro have demonstrated a direct relation between contrast intensity and amount of microbubbles. In animal studies, measurements derived from these curves correlated with changes in myocardial blood flow assessed by microspheres but with varying controversial results. Differences between investigators in technique of injection and size of microbubbles injected are among the list of factors that will alter the time-intensity curve and explain some of the differences in results between investigators. Several factors limit the application of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to the quantitation of myocardial blood flow. Nevertheless, the results from multiple investigations suggest that the technique is sensitive to changes in perfusion and may be applicable to the evaluation of regional coronary reserve and assessment of the results of revascularization procedures. Peak intensity and area under the time-intensity curve have provided consistent results between investigators; therefore, these measurements have been used to assess regional coronary reserve in experimental studies and patients with coronary artery disease. Although the results are encouraging, they cannot distinguish well between normal and mild impairments in coronary reserve and are subject to larger reproducibility errors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic and acute hypertension have multiple untoward effects on the coronary circulation, several of which may either mimic or markedly worsen the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. Early after the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, coronary vasodilator reserve is significantly impaired. During cardiac hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, the coronary arteries fail to enlarge in concert with ventricular enlargement. This failure results in a relative decrease by approximately 50% in the ratio of epicardial vessel diameter to the mass of myocardium perfused. The lower range of coronary subendocardial autoregulation is altered by chronic renovascular hypertension. A variety of vascular smooth muscle homeostatic mechanisms are abnormal in genetic models of hypertension, as is endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Acute hypertension may enhance constriction to serotonin, most likely through the release of potent vasoconstrictor substances from leukocytes and platelets that adhere to the endothelium as a result of endothelial damage. Finally, many of the consequences of myocardial infarction are worsened in the setting of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Dipyridamole echocardiography testing is a highly feasible, inexpensive, and safe diagnostic tool, with excellent specificity and good sensitivity--especially in patients with multivessel disease and/or resting dyssynergy--for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The test does not offer an \"all or none\" binary result but rather a complex stratification of the ischemic response along the coordinates of time and space, accurately identifying the degree of physiological impairment of coronary reserve, the severity and extent of coronary disease, the geographic location of the area at risk, and the prognostic outlook. It offers highly competitive diagnostic information versus more sophisticated, time-consuming, and costly radionuclide techniques; in comparison with other stress echocardiography techniques, it is more feasible than exercise and less invasive and better tolerated than pacing. The electrocardiogram usefully integrates the information provided by the mechanical marker of ischemia during dipyridamole testing. The finding of echocardiographically silent ST segment depression represents a clue to the identification of angiographically normal coronary arteries. On the basis of this evidence, dipyridamole testing with two-dimensional echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography can be considered a reasonable choice for the exercise-independent diagnosis of coronary artery disease.\r"

In particular, the issues of dilating coronary circulation by either increasing myocardial O2 demand or infusing dipyridamole and of assessing coronary reserve by either flow- or ischemia-related techniques are examined. In addition, the hypotheses of a physiological blood steal during exercise, a decrement of exercise ischemic threshold secondary to additional pharmacological vasodilation, and coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina patients, following the sequence dipyridamole-aminophylline, are discussed on the basis of preliminary studies.\r"

To compare the feasibility, sensitivity, and specificity of dobutamine echocardiography to dipyridamole echocardiography, we conducted both tests, on different days and in random order, on 35 patients with chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease. Dobutamine was administered in scalar doses up to 40 micrograms/kg per minute and dipyridamole up to 0.84 mg/kg for 10 minutes. Dobutamine echocardiography testing was positive in eight of 16 (50%) patients with single-vessel disease and in 11 of 12 (92%) patients with multivessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 68% for the presence of coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed the same sensitivity as dobutamine in patients with multivessel disease but a lower sensitivity (31%) in single-vessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 57%. The specificity of both tests was 100%. An ST segment shift of more than 1 mm compared with baseline was documented in 74% of the positive dobutamine echocardiography tests and in 81% of the positive dipyridamole echocardiography tests. No major complications occurred during both tests. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients with dobutamine and in none with dipyridamole (31% versus 0%, p less than 0.001). Thus, in our selected population dobutamine echocardiography testing demonstrated a similar overall sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared with dipyridamole, with a slightly better sensitivity for single-vessel disease but a greater arrhythmogenic potential.\r"

To assess its safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy in patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, 131 patients had the test before hospital discharge. The results were compared with those of maximum treadmill testing. We found that dipyridamole-induced transient asynergy remote from the infarct zone was more sensitive (74% versus 53%, p less than 0.05) and specific (97% versus 68%, p less than 0.01) than treadmill testing for detecting multivessel coronary artery disease. In a subgroup of 42 patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, dipyridamole echocardiography was able to detect in 27 the presence of jeopardized but viable myocardium in the infarct zone. An excellent correlation was found between dipyridamole echocardiography responses and infarct vessel patency. Finally, the prognostic impact of dipyridamole echocardiography on patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a consecutive series of 151 patients. Eighteen months of event-free survival was significantly different in patients with positive versus negative dipyridamole echocardiography results (76.1% versus 50.8%, p less than 0.01). The test was also superior to treadmill testing in predicting cardiac events. Thus, dipyridamole echocardiography performed early after acute myocardial infarction is safe, feasible, and accurate for predicting the extent of coronary artery disease and 18-month clinical outcome.\r"

We performed DET and exercise testing in 52 consecutive patients both before and after successful PTCA. Criteria of positivity for DET were transient dyssynergy absent or negligible in the baseline examination and exercise testing for an ST segment shift greater than 0.1 mV from baseline. All patients had an angiographically successful PTCA: the percent stenosis went from 78 +/- 7% before to 30 +/- 7% after PTCA. Exercise testing was positive in 49 and 29 patients, respectively, before and after PTCA (94% versus 44%, p less than 0.001).

The overall population consisted of 110 subjects with limited coronary artery disease and no myocardial infarction. Planar dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy was evaluated in 31 patients, computer-assisted exercise treadmill in 28, and high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing in 51. Sensitivity was assessed by rigorous gold standards to define disease severity, such as measurement of minimum cross-sectional area and percent area of stenosis, by quantitative computerized coronary angiography (Brown/Dodge method). On the basis of the results of previous studies, the presence of physiologically significant coronary artery disease was indicated by a stenotic minimum cross-sectional area (MCSA) of less than 2.0 mm2 or a greater than 75% area of stenosis. With MCSA as the gold standard, dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed sensitivities of 52%, 54%, and 61%, respectively, in the three different patient cohorts enrolled. With percent area of stenosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity figures obtained for dipyridamole-201Tl, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing were 64%, 54%, and 69%, respectively. For each of the three tests, sensitivity increased with increasing lesion severity. Sensitivity was also better in patients with left anterior descending coronary (LAD) disease when compared with patients with left circumflex or right coronary artery disease. Results of these studies, which were obtained with more strict patient selection criteria and by more rigorous gold standards than previous studies, demonstrate that in patients with limited coronary artery disease none of the tests evaluated is definitely superior in sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventilatory volumes and gas exchanges were measured during treadmill stress testing in 36 patients (11 with previous myocardial infarction) with electrocardiographic criteria of myocardial ischemia during the test and in 23 healthy, untrained control subjects of equivalent age. The anaerobic threshold was detected in 32 of 36 patients (89%) and in 22 of 23 control subjects (96%). The anaerobic threshold was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (13.5 +/- 1.9 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). In the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the anaerobic threshold was also significantly lower than in the control subjects (13.9 +/- 1.6 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). Among the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the 12 with a low ischemic threshold, which occurred during the first three steps of the modified Bruce protocol, had an anaerobic threshold significantly lower than the other nine patients (13.1 +/- 1.5 versus 14.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.01). However, even in the patients with a moderate to high ischemic threshold, the anaerobic threshold was significantly lower than in the control subjects (p less than 0.001). These data show that the anaerobic threshold can be measured in the great majority of patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The low anaerobic threshold level indicates a relevant functional impairment in these patients.\r"

Whether the right ventricular impairment is dependent primarily on ischemia of the right ventricle or requires a concomitant left ventricular dysfunction remains debatable. To assess the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of RCA-related ischemia, a systematic study of patients with single RCA disease (either vasospastic angina at rest or typical stable angina) was undertaken by radionuclide ventriculography. A high incidence of ischemia-induced right ventricular dysfunction was observed (93% and 95% in angina at rest and on effort, respectively), either alone or associated with left ventricular impairment. These results were compared with those obtained in a control population with isolated left anterior descending artery disease and either primary or secondary angina pectoris. We infer that the impairment of the right ventricle was related primarily to right ventricular ischemia and that left ventricular dysfunction alone did not cause an important depression of right ventricular systolic function. In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of RCA disease can be protean; the right ventricle can be the target of ischemia, and recognition of its impairment poses diagnostic problems. Radionuclide ventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography, together with stressors of coronary flow reserve, are reliable techniques for assessing RCA-related ischemia.\r"

Collateral perfusion must traverse not only these vessels but also proximal and distal coronary vessels. This series of resistances significantly modulates perfusion to collateral-dependent and potentially ischemic myocardium. The collateral vessels themselves possess unique vasomotor characteristics, particularly markedly augmented constriction to vasopressin. The recipient coronary microcirculation develops endothelial dysfunction during collateral development, a phenomenon that may markedly alter neurohumoral regulation of perfusion to collateral-dependent myocardium. Finally, the resistances proximal to the origin of the collateral vasculature, which are negligible at rest, become significant when flow to nonischemic regions (non-collateral-dependent) is increased, predisposing to the collateral steal phenomenon. Although collateral vessels play a crucial role in preventing myocardial infarction and often restore both resting and exercise perfusion to normal, the need to use these vessels is associated with important alterations of regulatory mechanisms in the coronary circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial hypertension can provoke a reduction in coronary flow reserve through several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, namely, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microvascular disease. These different targets of arterial hypertension should be explored with different diagnostic markers. The transient dyssynergy detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and evoked during dipyridamole infusion is a marker of coronary disease that is equally reliable in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. On the contrary, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is frequently elicited in hypertensive patients when angiographically assessed coronary disease is absent. This ischemiclike electrocardiographic response can be found in echocardiographically assessed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, even when left ventricular mass is normal, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is associated with an impaired coronary flow response to pacing, which is consistent with microvascular disease. Whether echocardiographically silent electrocardiographic changes are simply diagnostic noises transmitting a misleading false positive response or a potentially important clinical marker of early myocardial damage remains a pivotal though still unanswered question.\r"

  ".W": "The widespread use of exercise testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients suspected of having coronary artery disease led to the detection of ischemic changes in many subjects who subsequently were found to have angiographically normal epicardial vessels--the false positive response. Such a result is usually interpreted as indicating that the subject's chest pain is of noncardiac origin. For the past several years, we have studied the mechanism of pain resembling angina that occurs in patients with normal epicardial coronary arteries demonstrated by angiography; we believe these studies have shed some light on this problem. Patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries who present because of a history of angina-like pain and/or ischemic changes detected during exercise electrocardiogram testing were evaluated by measuring great cardiac vein flow (under baseline conditions and after cardiac pacing, with and without intravenous administration of ergonovine) and by radionuclide angiography before and during exercise. We found that a substantial number of these subjects showed inadequate coronary vasodilator reserve and had exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction suggestive of myocardial ischemia. We concluded from our results that there is a distinct clinical syndrome of myocardial ischemia caused by abnormal resistance responses of the prearteriolar coronary microvasculature. We now refer to this syndrome as microvascular angina. In a series of 115 patients with documented microvascular angina, we also found that only 10% had ischemic ST changes with exercise testing (2% of the men and 17% of the women developed ischemic ST segment changes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the exercise hemodynamic correlates of coronary flow abnormalities measured in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, 105 patients with microvascular angina (defined as an increase in coronary vascular resistance during pacing stress after ergonovine administration in the absence of significant epicardial constriction and associated with provocation of the patient's typical chest pain) and 27 patients without any coronary flow abnormality (normal) were analyzed. Of the 105 patients with microvascular angina, 75 had normal electrocardiographic responses to treadmill exercise testing, 22 had ischemic responses, and eight had bundle branch block during exercise. All 27 normal patients had normal electrocardiographic responses to exercise. Patients with ischemic electrocardiographic responses (0 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01), and those with bundle branch block (-2 +/- 6%, p less than 0.01) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction responses to exercise compared with the normal group, who demonstrated an 8 +/- 6% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography during exercise, and microvascular angina patients with a normal electrocardiographic response to exercise, who demonstrated a 5 +/- 7% increase in ejection fraction. Although the microvascular response to ergonovine was no different among the three microvascular angina exercise groups, the administration of dipyridamole caused less coronary vasodilation in those patients with apparently ischemic or bundle branch block responses to exercise compared with those with normal electrocardiograms during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The human heart in the fasting state extracts free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketones from circulating blood. The utilization of FFA accounts for most of the oxygen consumed and energy produced at rest. Patients with angiographically demonstrable coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris have a resting myocardial metabolism similar to that of normal individuals. During atrial pacing in normal persons, there is a significant enhancement of glucose uptake but that of FFA is unchanged, and the oxidation of carbohydrates accounts for more than 60% of the energy produced. In patients with stable angina, myocardial perfusion becomes regionally inadequate during stress. Despite the increase of myocardial glucose utilization, carbohydrate oxidation is negligible. Pyruvate will not be oxidized but in the presence of increased amounts of reduced coenzymes will be reduced to lactate. In addition, a greater amount of alanine will be released by the myocardium through the transamination of pyruvate, with a concomitantly greater uptake of glutamate that serves as the NH2 donor. In addition, glutamate may be used as an anaerobic fuel through conversion to succinate coupled with GTP formation. Although coronary hemodynamics, including myocardial perfusion, return to baseline within a few minutes after stress, a longer time course is needed for myocardial metabolism to become normal. In particular, myocardial utilization of exogenous glucose remains higher well after the normalization of hemodynamic parameters. This is more pronounced in postischemic myocardium, but it also occurs in nonischemic muscle, and glucose is presumably used for rebuilding glycogen stores that were depleted during ischemia.\r"

Patients with or without previous myocardial infarction admitted for coronary evaluation and not submitted to any stress testing because of clinical reasons are at a higher risk for subsequent death. For prognostication, no test has been better validated than exercise electrocardiography: it can identify patients at low and high risk for future cardiac events among those without symptoms, with typical chest pain, and with previous myocardial infarction. In patients with triple-vessel disease, the results of exercise also allow those at low and high risk to be recognized. Both exercise radionuclide angiography and 201Tl scintigraphy (the latter in larger patient populations) have also demonstrated significant prognostic value on patients with or without previous myocardial infarction. Neither one has shown superiority to the other in prognostication. So far, they have been considered the only viable alternatives to exercise electrocardiography stress testing for diagnosis and prognostication. However, their costs limit their extensive application. Preliminary data suggest that intravenous dipyridamole echocardiography can be used for both diagnosis and prognostication of coronary artery disease; moreover, the prognostic information derived from dipyridamole echocardiography testing seems independent of and additive to that provided by exercise electrocardiography. Further prospective studies on larger patient populations are needed to better define the prognostic value of dipyridamole echocardiography testing.\r"

These data were obtained from a total of 1,074 such subjects from patient populations at four centers (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio; Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest, Hungary; the university hospitals, Zurich and Basel, Switzerland; and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, Calif.) and used to derive four separate probability algorithms. Each algorithm is based on patient data from study samples at three of the four centers and consists of 272 logistic functions, which are related to linear combinations of 13 variables (age, sex, type of chest pain, systolic blood pressure, resting electrocardiogram, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, achieved exercise work load, achieved heart rate, exercise-induced angina and hypotension, heart rate-adjusted resting ST depression, and exercise ST slope). The four algorithms were cross validated by testing them on the populations not involved in their derivation. The resulting probabilities in the four test groups were then compared with the angiographic findings of triple-vessel/left main coronary artery disease. The discriminatory power of all the algorithms was fair to good (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68, 0.75, 0.82, 0.85) in the test groups.

The possibility of differentiating normal from nonperfused myocardium and measuring the extent of the area at risk and myocardial infarction size has already been demonstrated. The aim of this paper is to review the approaches to quantitation of coronary blood flow by contrast echocardiography. In a series of studies, echocardiographic contrast agents have been treated like \"deposit tracers.\" After an upstream contrast injection, myocardial contrast intensity (according to the partition principle) hypothetically reflects the fraction of contrast, and consequently of flow, distributed to the myocardium. A good correlation was found between changes in peak myocardial contrast intensity and corresponding changes in coronary blood flow (r = 0.83). However, this approach is limited by electronic signal distortion and attenuation artifacts. In other studies contrast agents have been treated as intravascular \"free-passing\" tracers, and (according to the dilution principle) their myocardial transit times hypothetically reflect coronary blood flow. A prolonged myocardial washout halftime with coronary underperfusion has been documented in animal experiments and patients with severe coronary stenosis. However, the majority of contrast agents have intermediate characteristics and do not belong to either category of tracers; furthermore, signal distortion and attenuation phenomena affect the washout phase. The time of myocardial contrast appearance, which is independent of tracer characteristics, permitted the differentiation of baseline conditions from coronary underperfusion but seemed inaccurate in the quantitation of coronary blood flow (r = 0.60).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a Southern Californian cohort of 848 nondiabetic postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, fasting plasma glucose levels positively correlated with levels of the endogenous androgens dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone and negatively with sex-hormone-binding globulin across the whole range of glucose and hormone levels. Mean dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone levels were 16% and 46% higher, respectively, and mean sex-hormone-binding globulin levels 27% lower in the top compared with the bottom quartile of fasting plasma glucose levels. This relationship was independent of age, body mass index, cigarette smoking habit and exogenous oestrogen use. 3. These findings raise questions about the possible physiological role of androgens in the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and, possibly, in the mediation of the some of the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes in women.\r"

In order to determine whether or not the membrane structures probed by these indicators were related to platelet physiological functions, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was determined in parallel. 3. At physiological temperature, the fluorescence anisotropy of 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was decreased in untreated hypertensive patients (0.276 +/- 0.002 versus 0.288 +/- 0.002, n = 23 and 22, P less than 0.001), indicating a lowered microviscosity at the lipid-water interface of cell membrane. It correlated inversely with blood pressure (P less than 0.001) and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.030).

Phosphofructokinase-1, a key glycolytic enzyme, is controlled in the long term via regulation of synthesis and degradation of the protein itself, while in the short term it is regulated by allosteric effectors, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (the most potent). In the present study hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity as well as phosphofructokinase-2 activity and the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were assayed to determine if they might contribute to the derangement of carbohydrate metabolism seen commonly in sepsis. 2. The levels of glycogen and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the activity of phosphofructokinase-1 and phosphofructokinase-2 were determined in hepatic biopsies obtained at laparotomy from six patients with and seven patients without abdominal septic foci. 3. A significant increase in plasma lactate concentration was observed in the septic patients, whereas no significant differences in tissue glycogen content or plasma glucose concentration were seen between the groups. 4. No significant change in plasma insulin concentration was observed. However, levels of the counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol and adrenaline) were elevated in the septic patients. 5. A 60% decrease in hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity was seen in the septic patients. However, no significant changes in hepatic phosphofructokinase-2 activity and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content were observed in the septic patients. 6. The present results demonstrate that the decrease in hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity occurring in sepsis does not appear to reflect alterations in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.\r"

During secondary ischaemia, flaps underwent either total ischaemia (arterial and venous blood supply occluded) or partial ischaemia (vein only occluded). Some of these flaps were treated at the time of reperfusion with the free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and/or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38,485. 2. After 30 min of reperfusion, superoxide dismutase treatment significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels, elevated during ischaemia. Superoxide dismutase also reduced tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and xanthine oxidase, indicators of free-radical damage, and restored the depleted tissue levels of superoxide dismutase. 3. UK-38,485 treatment failed to significantly alter any of these tissue free-radical parameters, although this agent significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels. 4. Combined superoxide dismutase plus UK-38,485 treatment was not significantly better than either treatment alone with respect to any parameter. 5. Partial ischaemia led to consistently higher levels of tissue free radicals and blood thromboxane than did total ischaemia. Thus partial ischaemia appears to result in greater free-radical damage than total ischaemia. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane acts as a mediator for free-radical damage in the ischaemic changes within the flap.\r"

To evaluate whether endogenous peptide release is involved in the airway responses to inhaled platelet-activating factor, we measured lung resistance and airway microvascular leakage in anaesthetized guinea pigs pretreated with inhalation of either saline or a combination of the peptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (0.1 mmol/l: 60 breaths; 7.5 nmol), to inhibit neutral endopeptidase, and captopril (4.6 mmmol/l: 60 breaths; 350 nmol), to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme. 2. Airway microvascular leakage was determined by the albumin marker Evans Blue dye injected intravenously (20 mg/kg) before platelet-activating factor or sham challenge. 3. Inhaled platelet-activating factor induced a maximum increase in lung resistance (1.43 +/- 0.33 cmH2O s-1 ml-1) which was not significantly different after pretreatment with phosphoramidon and captopril (1.44 +/- 0.21 cmH2O s-1 ml-1). 4. Inhalation of platelet-activating factor caused a significant increase in extravasated Evans Blue dye at all airway levels, an effect which was not potentiated by peptidase inhibition. Similar results were obtained with dye extravasated into the airway lumen and absorbed by a filter paper placed on the tracheal mucosa. Approximately 11% of the total tracheal dye was found in the lumen. There was a high correlation between tracheal tissue and tracheal lumen Evans Blue dye (r = 0.91; P less than 0.001). 5. We found a significantly lower dry to wet weight ratio in proximal intrapulmonary airways of animals exposed to platelet-activating factor, suggesting that platelet-activating factor caused airway oedema at this airway level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. The diabetic neuropathic foot exhibits excess arteriovenous anastomotic shunt flow due to a reduced sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Local axon reflexes (mediating postural vasoconstriction, for example) are preserved even in severe diabetic neuropathy. This excess shunt flow and its local neurogenic control may be important in the development of complications of the neuropathic limb. 2. The response of arteriovenous anastomoses to local heating was assessed in 13 diabetic patients with neuropathy (12 insulin-dependent), 10 diabetic control patients (seven insulin-dependent) and 10 normal control subjects. The aim was to study the local reflex control of arteriovenous flow when central sympathetic tone had been largely removed. 3. The change in skin blood flow on local heating to 44 degrees C was measured by using a laser Doppler flowmeter in standard environmental conditions with the foot at heart level. Two sites were assessed: (i) the plantar surface of the great toe (a site in which skin blood flow is dominated by arteriovenous shunt flow) and (ii) the dorsum of the foot (a site without anastomotic flow). 4. It was found that when heat was applied to the plantar surface of the great toe in the diabetic patients with neuropathy a paradoxical decrease in flow through arteriovenous anastomoses occurred, flow declining to 65% (P less than 0.05) of its resting value. This could be compared with an increase in flow over the same time period of 262% and 228% (P less than 0.01) in diabetic control patients and normal subjects, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma concentrations of [3H]dihydroxyphenylglycol, the intraneuronal metabolite of noradrenaline, were examined during intravenous infusion of [3H]noradrenaline in 43 subjects, to assess the nature of its formation. Noradrenaline re-uptake by sympathetic nerves was estimated in 11 subjects from the effects of neuronal uptake blockade with desipramine on noradrenaline clearance and plasma concentrations of [3H]dihydroxyphenylglycol and endogenous dihydroxyphenylglycol. In seven subjects noradrenaline re-uptake and spillover into plasma were examined before and during mental arithmetic or handgrip exercise. 2. During infusion of [3H]noradrenaline, plasma [3H]dihydroxyphenylglycol increased progressively, indicating its formation from previously stored [3H]noradrenaline leaking from vesicles as well as from [3H]noradrenaline metabolism immediately after removal into sympathetic nerves. Thus, to estimate noradrenaline re-uptake, the amount of [3H]dihydroxyphenylglycol derived from [3H]noradrenaline metabolized immediately after removal into the sympathetic axoplasm must be isolated from that derived from [3H]noradrenaline sequestered into vesicles. 3. At rest in the supine position the rate of noradrenaline re-uptake was 474 +/- 122 pmol min-1 kg-1, 9.5-fold higher than the rate of spillover of noradrenaline into plasma (49.6 +/- 6.4 pmol min-1 kg-1). Noradrenaline re-uptake and spillover into plasma were both increased during mental arithmetic and isometric handgrip exercise.\r"

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly at night in orthopaedic subjects but not in quadriplegic patients, and night-time blood pressures were similar in both groups. 3. Cumulative summation of differences from a reference value (cusum analysis) confirmed a markedly diminished diurnal blood pressure variation in the quadriplegic patients. 4. These findings could not be accounted for on the basis of blood pressure variations during chronic postural change. 5. Heart rate fell significantly at night in both groups. 6. The findings suggest that the increase in blood pressure during waking hours in neurologically intact subjects is a consequence of a diurnal variation in sympathetic activity (absent in quadriplegic patients with sympathetic decentralization) which is independent of changes in physical activity.\r"

Contrary to previous reports, benign adhesions were responsible for the obstruction in all patients with a history of benign colon disease, 82.6 percent of patients with a history of adenocarcinoma of the colon without known recurrence, and 30.1 percent of patients with known recurrent malignancy. The morbidity and mortality was more related to the etiology of the obstruction rather than the preoperative delay or operative procedure performed. Considering the high likelihood of adhesive obstruction in patients with a history of, or known, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, it is suggested that these not deter surgeons from aggressive early surgical intervention in these patients who develop small bowel obstruction.\r"

Forty-five tumors had an axial extension between 1 and 3 cm, and 40 tumors had an axial extension of at least 4 cm. Diathermic snare resection was performed to remove large tumoral fragments prior to laser photocoagulation of the residual flat lesions. Treatments were repeated every 15 days until total tumor destruction was achieved. A carcinoma was detected in biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopic treatment of five patients. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Treatment results could be analyzed in 78 patients. Successful treatment was achieved in 67 patients. Tumor destruction was complete in 77 percent of patients who had lesions of at least 4 cm diameter and in 93 percent of patients with smaller lesions. The axial extension of the tumor was the main factor affecting the results of treatment. No major complications occurred. During the average 103-week follow-up period, 21 percent of the patients with total tumor destruction had a recurrence. The risk of recurrence was correlated with the number of initial treatment sessions and previous surgery treatment. It would appear that the treatment with endoscopic resection prior to Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is a safe and effective method in the destruction of colorectal villous adenomas.\r"

Forty-one fistulas, in 33 patients, were treated by conventional fistulotomy (17 subcutaneous, 19 intersphincteric, 5 low transsphincteric fistulas). Thirty wounds (73 percent) healed within 3 months and eight more wounds (93 percent) healed within 6 months. Three wounds did not heal within 12-18 months. Two of these patients subsequently required proctocolectomy. Wound healing was not influenced by the presence of rectal Crohn's disease or granulomatous inflammation in the tract. No change in continence was experienced by 26 of the 33 patients who underwent fistulotomy. Three patients required proctocolectomy and the remaining four patients experienced minor degrees of incontinence postoperatively. Sixteen high transsphincteric, five suprasphincteric, and one extrasphincteric fistula in 22 patients were treated by laying open external tracts and placing a noncutting seton through the sphincter, which was left in place for prolonged periods to maintain drainage. During follow-up (6 months to 10 years, median 2.5 years), three fistulas healed and seven remained quiescent. Nine patients required further treatment by a new seton and three patients required proctocolectomy. Eight of the 22 patients who had a seton inserted had no change in continence, and six patients in this group developed minor changes in continence, mostly related to diarrhea associated with intestinal disease. Anal fistulas in Crohn's disease, which involve minimal sphincter muscle, can be successfully treated by fistulotomy. High fistulas should be treated with seton drainage to limit recurrent suppuration and preserve sphincter function.\r"

Cell proliferation was evaluated in rectal biopsies by in vitro 3H thymidine incorporation by measuring the labeling index and the position of labeled cells along the crypt; polyamines were determined with a chromatographic method. In ulcerative colitis patients the labeling index was significantly increased, and labeled cells were shifted toward the upper part of the crypt when compared with controls. Ileorectal anastomosis patients showed a normalization of the labeling index and a distribution of labeled cells similar to controls. Polyamine levels were also increased in ulcerative colitis patients; in ileorectal anastomosis patients, the level of polyamines was decreased in respect to unoperated patients and return to normal values except for spermine. Because the increased proliferation and higher polyamine levels are related to increased colon cancer risk, our results confirm that ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for the development of carcinoma. Ileorectal anastomosis may reduce this risk through a normalization of mucosal cell proliferative activity and of some polyamine levels.\r"

Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes.\r"

The following study was designed to isolate the pouch and to compare intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing pouch compliance. Thirty-three mongrel dogs underwent rectal mucosectomy and protocolectomy with S-pouch (S) in nine, stapled J-pouch (SJ) in nine, handsewn J-pouch (HJ) in nine and handsewn W-pouch (SW) in six. At 2 weeks, each dog underwent laparotomy, the small bowel 2 cm proximal to the pouch was clamped, and in vivo pouch compliance was measured using anal balloon occlusion and continuous saline infusion manometry. The pouch was then removed and ex vivo measurements were repeated. Mean compliance slopes between 0 and 40 cm H2O were compared by ANOVA and paired t-tests. In vivo and ex vivo compliance in ml/cm H2O was 3.1 +/- 1.2 and 3.8 +/- 1.6 (P = 0.25) for the S-pouch, 3.1 +/- 0.6 and 5.2 +/- 1.7 (P less than 0.01) for the SJ-pouch, 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 4.8 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.001) for the HJ-pouch, 3.6 +/- 0.6 and 6.0 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.001) for the W-pouch. Pearson's correlation coefficient for in vivo and ex vivo measurements of the S, SJ, HJ, and W pouches were r2 = 0.066, 0.001, 0.039, and 0.379, respectively. It is concluded that: 1) Isolated pouch compliance can be accurately measured in experimental animals with proximal and distal occlusion and inflow manometry. 2) In vivo compliance is significantly less in the HJ compared with S, SJ, and W pouches. 3) Differences between in vivo and ex vivo compliance of SJ, HJ, and SW pouches are significant. 4) In vivo and ex vivo compliance determinations correlate poorly. 5) Extrinsic factors contribute significantly to pouch compliance.\r"

  ".W": "Six patients with complete transection of the spinal cord and six healthy volunteers were examined by using anorectal manometry together with electromyographic (EMG) recording of the external anal sphincter composed of striated muscle. Anal pressure and EMG activity of the external anal sphincter were continuously recorded at rest and during gradual rectal distention (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ml) by means of an air-filled balloon eliciting a rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) at the upper part, and an inflation reflex (IR) at the lower part of the anal canal. All patients and controls had a RAIR for each rectal distention volume. A relationship between the duration of the RAIR and the rectal distention volume was present in controls only. In controls the IR was present for each rectal distention volume, whereas it was present in only one patient for a 40-ml volume. During the resting period, all controls showed continuous tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter, but after 30 minutes all the patients showed a decrease and ultimately in five cases a disappearance of the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter. In spinal patients, the presence or absence of EMG activity of the external anal sphincter did not modify the anal canal pressure. These results indicate that: 1) the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter seems to be under the control of supraspinal structures, because in spinal patients it disappears in the absence of sensitive inputs toward the spinal cord; 2) the absence of EMG activity at rest indicates that the external anal sphincter is not implicated in the RAIR disturbances observed in spinal patients; 3) the IR is not a spinal reflex but is under voluntary control, because it is not present in spinal humans; 4) in spinal humans the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter does not play a role in the maintenance of the anal pressure at rest.\r"

In 31 evaluable cases the observation period was at least 12 months (mean 24 months). Esophagitis remained in remission in two thirds of patients despite dose reduction. Relapses of esophagitis occurred in 10 cases within six months, which rapidly healed by increasing the omeprazole dose to 40 mg. No further recurrence with 20 mg omeprazole was found later than six months. Peptic strictures primarily requiring repeated dilatation in six patients during healing with omeprazole did not reappear while on omeprazole maintenance. Major side effects that could be attributed to omeprazole were not observed. Gastrin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range in the vast majority. It is concluded that omeprazole maintenance treatment in severe reflux esophagitis is an effective and safe therapy.\r"

Two hundred eighteen reflux events were detected in the recumbent posture after a meal during a 40-min interval. Both techniques simultaneously detected only 23% of all reflux events. Scintigraphy alone detected 61% of all reflux events as opposed to 16% for pH monitoring. Of those reflux events diagnosed only by scintigraphy, more occurred while the intraesophageal pH was less than 4 (ie, during an acid-clearing interval) than while the intraesophageal pH was greater than 4 (ie, when intragastric contents were neutralized by the meal). Most reflux events occurred during periods of stable, but low LES pressure. While reflux events diagnosed by scintigraphy significantly decreased during the second of two 20-min postprandial intervals, those by pH monitoring tended to increase. That simultaneous scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed on less than 1/3 of all reflux events not only underscores the fact that both techniques measured different physical components of the esophageal refluxate (ie, volume vs acid concentration, respectively), but also were influenced by different physiologic events such as the ingestion of a meal, gastric emptying, and esophageal acid clearance.\r"

Therefore, we prospectively compared these test results in 75 consecutive noncardiac chest pain patients who had both an acid perfusion test and chest pain during 24-hr pH testing. A positive acid perfusion test was defined by the replication of the patient's typical chest pain twice by the acid infusion. Esophageal pH testing identified abnormal amounts of acid reflux and correlated symptoms with acid reflux--the \"symptom index.\" Fifteen patients (20%) had a positive acid perfusion test while 45 patients (59%) had a positive symptom index (range 6-100%). Only 9/34 (26%) patients with abnormal reflux had a positive acid perfusion test. Although it had excellent specificity (83-94%), the acid perfusion test had poor sensitivity (32-46%) when compared to the symptom index regardless of the percent positive cutoff level. The best positive predictive value for the acid perfusion test was 87%, but this occurred when the test sensitivity was 32%. Modifying the end point of a positive acid perfusion test to include heartburn improves the sensitivity (52-67%) while markedly compromising specificity and positive predictive value. Thus, esophageal pH monitoring correlating symptoms with acid reflux is superior to the acid perfusion test for identifying an acid sensitive esophagus in patients with noncardiac chest pain.\r"

We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H. pylori. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured. Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing. Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H. pylori. Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H. pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H. pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively). The children with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001). The reliability of serum anti-H. pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed. These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H. pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs.\r"

A double-blind, double-dummy trial was performed in 270 patients, 241 of whom were studied histologically for the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 10 mg every morning, omeprazole, 20 mg every morning, or ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for four weeks. Endoscopy was performed on entry and at weekly intervals during the study; at least two antral biopsies were taken on each occasion to assess the activity and degree of chronic inflammation, as reflected by the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and mononuclear cell infiltration, respectively. Biopsy specimens also were assessed histologically for H. pylori. The sex, age and maximal acid output were comparable in the three treatment groups. The percentages of patients showing an improvement in the activity of gastritis in the four consecutive weeks of treatment were 9%, 40%, 51%, and 53% for omeprazole, 10 mg (N = 78); 14%, 42%, 49%, and 53% for omeprazole, 20 mg (N = 81); and 2%, 23%, 30%, and 33% for ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day (N = 82) (life table analysis gave P less than 0.01 for both omeprazole regimens compared with ranitidine). The degree of chronic inflammation showed similar changes. The density of H. pylori decreased significantly after treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg or 20 mg, (both, P less than 0.00001) but not with ranitidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pH was monitored throughout a 24-hr period, 2 hr in basal conditions and 22 hr during treatment, with a gastric probe. Basal gastric pH was 2.1 +/- 0.2 in the infused and 2.4 +/- 0.2 in the bolus group (P greater than 0.05). The hydrogen ion concentrations were 25.1 +/- 8 and 20.0 +/- 7 mmol/liter, respectively (P greater than 0.05). After ranitidine administration, mean pH was 6.3 +/- 0.6 in patients treated by infusion and 4.5 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.001) in those who received the drug in bolus; hydrogen ion concentration was 2.5 +/- 2 and 6.9 +/- 6, respectively, (P less than 0.001). Percent of inhibition of acid secretion was 90% in the infused and 68% in the bolus group. Infusion raised pH to values constantly above 4, whereas bolus administration resulted in wide fluctuations. These data indicate that continuous infusion of ranitidine is superior to bolus administration in controlling gastric acidity in critically ill patients.\r"

Severe endoscopic lesions (petechiae, erosions, ulcers, and esophageal candidiasis) were found only in the group taking the soluble formulation of diclofenac (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). The endoscopic healing of biopsies at one week was delayed by both preparations in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). Neither formulation produced significantly more histological inflammation or minor endoscopic lesions (erythema, red striae) than placebo. Both formulations were equally well tolerated and produced no more symptoms than placebo. This study suggests that soluble diclofenac acts topically to delay gastroduodenal healing and produce gastroduodenal injury; it thus provides a model for future studies of the production, perpetuation, and healing of peptic lesions.\r"

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the venoconstriction is mediated by leukotrienes and that inhibition of the venoconstriction would protect against ethanol injury. Intragastric application of the leukotriene receptor antagonist MK-571 inhibited both venoconstriction and gross lesion formation. However, although local submucosal application of MK-571 inhibited venoconstriction, it did not protect the overlying gastric mucosa against ethanol injury. We conclude that leukotrienes play a significant pathogenetic role in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, but while the venoconstriction, mediated by leukotrienes, is one of the factors that promote lesion formation, it is not an essential one.\r"

  ".W": "Our aim is to develop a less costly but accurate test of stomach emptying and small bowel transit by utilizing selected scintigraphic observations 1-6 hr after ingestion of a radiolabeled solid meal. These selected data were compared with more detailed analyses that require multiple scans and labor-intensive technical support. A logistic discriminant analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of selected summaries of scintigraphic transit measurements. We studied 14 patients with motility disorders (eight neuropathic and six myopathic, confirmed by standard gastrointestinal manometry) and 37 healthy subjects. The patient group had abnormal gastric emptying (GE) and small bowel transit time (SBTT). The proportion of radiolabel retained in the stomach from 2 to 4 hr (GE 2 hr, GE 3 hr, GE 4 hr), as well as the proportion filling the colon at 4 and 6 hr (CF 4 hr, CF 6 hr) were individually able to differentiate health from disease (P less than 0.05 for each). From the logistic discriminant model, an estimated sensitivity of 93% resulted in similar specificities for detailed and selected transit parameters for gastric emptying (range: 62-70%). Similarly, combining selected observations, such as GE 4 hr with CF 6 hr, had a specificity of 76%, which was similar to the specificity of combinations of more detailed analyses. Based on the present studies and future confirmation in a larger number of patients, including those with less severe motility disorders, the 2-, 4-, and 6-hr scans with quantitation of proportions of counts in stomach and colon should provide a useful, relatively inexpensive strategy to identify and monitor motility disorders in clinical and epidemiologic studies.\r"

Radionuclide solid-liquid gastric emptying tests were performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month period. Symptoms were assessed monthly by diary and every three months by the investigators; frequency and severity of symptoms were scored in a standardized manner. For the whole group of 21 patients, gastric emptying of both solids and liquids improved significantly after one year of cisapride (P less than 0.05). Among chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients, there was predominantly an improvement in gastric emptying of solids; in contrast, patients with gastroparesis had a greater improvement in liquid emptying. Total symptom score improved significantly in the gastroparesis group (median score: 8 at baseline vs 6 at one year, P less than 0.05) but not in the chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients (median score at baseline 10 vs 9 at one year). Similarly, body weight showed a trend towards improvement in the gastroparesis group. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that during a 12-month open trial, cisapride was effective in improving gastric emptying in patients with gastric stasis and consistently improved symptoms in those with gastroparesis.\r"

Mechanical activity was recorded by means of a multi-pressure sensor probe placed intraoperatively into the jejunum. Abdominal surgery abolished normal motility only for a short period of time. The time for the reappearance of regular recurring activity fronts varied with the type of the surgical procedure from 3 hr after cholecystectomy to the sixth postoperative day after colon resection. The fed pattern occurred after the first postoperative interdigestive motor complex in all experiments. Stimulation was observed with ceruletide, which induced contractile activity in the small intestine during postoperative ileus. No coordinated caudad propagating activity was observed. The postoperative interdigestive motor complex did not correlate in time with the first passage of flatus and stool in our patients. Thus, the restoration of motility in the small intestine did not coincide with the clinical relief from the so-called \"physiological\" postoperative ileus.\r"

Monocyte zinc was significantly decreased in both 12 inpatients and 22 outpatients compared with controls (P less than 0.001) but lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell zinc were normal. When cultured monocytes from 10 outpatients with Crohn's disease were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandin E2 production increased markedly, coupled with a fall in monocyte zinc. In matched controls, prostaglandin E2 production was significantly less and monocyte zinc remained stable. No difference in interleukin-1 release was noted between patients and controls. The addition of prednisolone to cell cultures suppressed prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 synthesis, and monocyte zinc did not change. Zinc chloride augmented prostaglandin E2 production in patients, but not controls, and interleukin-1 remained stable. These results demonstrate a link between low monocyte zinc concentration and excessive prostaglandin production in patients with Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood. Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes. The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors. The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta. It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene. The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development.\r"

Two important growth factors produced in the regenerating liver are discussed, TGF alpha, an autocrine, stimulatory growth factor, and TGF beta, a paracrine inhibitory factor. The balance between the activities of these factors is likely to play an important role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation. The expression of some protooncogenes occurs sequentially during the first few hours after partial hepatectomy and is a marker for the entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle (proliferative competence). As hepatocytes become competent to proliferate, they respond to TGF alpha and other growth factors and enter a proliferative phase. It is possible that TGF beta 1 serves as a stop signal for liver regeneration but the mechanisms by which TGF beta inhibits hepatocyte DNA synthesis are still unknown.\r"

  ".U": "91215990\r", 
  ".W": "Phenobarbital (PB) added to the medium of cultured rat hepatocytes alters epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependent mitogenesis in a biphasic manner; PB concentrations less than 1.5 mM are growth stimulatory but higher concentrations significantly inhibit normal hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the growth of putative preneoplastic cells is inhibited less by high concentrations of PB. Mechanistic studies designed to test the ability of PB to alter the early events of EGF signal transduction demonstrate that PB neither competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor nor alters EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. However, pretreatment with PB (greater than 1 mM) results in a transient inhibition of EGF binding to hepatocytes. The kinetics of this effect are similar to those obtained when hepatocytes are exposed to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a skin tumor promoter and activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. However, several observations suggest that distinct mechanisms mediate the responses to these two tumor promoters. First, the inhibitory effects of PB and TPA on EGF binding are additive. Also down-regulation of EGF receptors in response to TPA occurs with hepatocytes, A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and rat liver epithelial cells, but only hepatocytes are sensitive to PB. Furthermore, translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane occurs in hepatocytes treated with TPA but not in those treated with PB. The chronic treatment of rats with PB further sensitizes hepatocytes to EGF receptor down-regulation by in vitro PB while desensitizing them to EGF receptor down-regulation by TPA. This latter effect is correlated with a decreased ability of TPA to induce translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane. PB significantly increases the intracellular concentration of TGF-beta 1 in periportal hepatocytes but not in putative preneoplastic cells. TGF-beta 1 may therefore have an important function in regulating early stages of cell cycle progression in proliferating hepatocytes.\r"

It has also been demonstrated in dogs, rabbits, and pigs. It is organ specific, both in vivo and in vitro, but species nonspecific. It induces liver growth after a 10- to 12-hr lag period, during which time new protein and RNA synthesis are required. The initial events induced by HSS in HTC hepatoma cells in vitro include a rapid influx of Na+ via the Na+/H+ antiport and a rapid influx of extracellular Ca2+. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ appears to be dependent on the influx of Na+ and the influx of Na+ is necessary, but not in itself sufficient, to stimulate DNA synthesis.\r"

The activity of this highly purified HSS, named Acr-F4, was assessed in two in vivo models. In 40% hepatectomized rats, it produced a fivefold increase in the proliferative rate normally seen following this partial hepatectomy. In Eck fistula dogs, the level of base increase in hepatocyte renewal was amplified threefold by an infusion of Acr-F4 (50 ng/kg/day). Acr-F4 had no influence on the regenerative response of the kidney following a unilateral nephrectomy or of the bowel following a 40% resection of the small bowel. On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that HSS (Acr-F4) has a high biological activity and is organ specific.\r"

Hepatopoietin A is a large (105,000 kDa in monomeric form) heparin binding growth factor that is a heterodimer of two polypeptide chains (70,000 and 35,000 kDa). Another heparin binding growth factor, acidic FGF, also stimulates hepatocyte DNA synthesis but at a level comparable to half that of HPTA. These findings, along with recent observations of stimulation of liver growth and hepatoma formation in mice transgenic for the tat gene of the AIDS virus and overproducers of the heparin binding factor hst/KS3, raise the issue of the overall importance of different heparin binding growth factors in the control of hepatic growth regulation. Hepatopoietin B is a glycolipid that also acts as a complete hepatocytic mitogen. The role of the above substances as well as the role of norepinephrine, acting as a mitogenic trigger for stimulation of the rapid early phenomena associated with liver regeneration, is discussed.\r"

The F-1-P metabolism was slower in PCS dogs (N = 2) as compared to either the normal (N = 2) or PCS + CsA-treated dogs (N = 3) (P less than 0.05). The intracellular pH temporarily decreased from 7.3 +/- 0.05 to 7.0 +/- 0.05 during the fructose challenge. The regenerative indexes were increased in the PCS + CsA group (P less than 0.01). These data obtained in vivo using 31P-NMR spectroscopy in the liver following a portacaval shunt, suggest that: (1) the energy status of the liver and the metabolic response to fructose are reduced in PCS compared to normal animals and (2) CsA treatment enhances the regenerative response of the liver and prevents the reduction in hepatic function associated with portacaval shunting.\r"

Our primary objective was to determine if the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the in vitro culture system would have a positive effect on oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. DESIGN: We studied the effect of different EGF concentrations on both denuded and cumulus-enclosed mouse oocytes cultured in vitro. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of oocytes undergoing germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and polar body one formation over time as a function of EGF concentration was determined. RESULTS: A dose-related positive effect of EGF on both GVBD and polar body one formation over time was observed for mouse oocytes. As well, a similar effect of EGF was seen on immature human oocytes that had not been stimulated with exogenous gonadotropins. CONCLUSIONS: The use of EGF may allow for the performance of successful in vitro fertilization procedures using immature human oocytes retrieved during unstimulated cycles.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective outpatient study of 36 hyperandrogenic women and controls divided into groups based on the presence or absence of significant hirsutism and the presence or absence of moderate to severe acne. Serum levels of adrenal and ovarian derived androgens were elevated but similar in all patient groups. INTERVENTIONS: Measurement of serum androgens including metabolites of 5 alpha-reductase activity: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate and androsterone (A) glucuronide and sulfate. RESULTS: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate were elevated in all groups (P less than 0.05) and could differentiate between hirsute and nonhirsute patients but were similar in patients with and without acne. Serum A glucuronide and sulfate were only significantly elevated in patients with acne (P less than 0.01) and were higher than levels in controls and hirsute patients without acne. Ratios of precursor androgens to A glucuronide and sulfate were significantly higher in patients with acne compared with patients without acne (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Altered peripheral metabolism in acne may favor the formation of A conjugates, which may help differentiate acne from hirsutism among hyperandrogenic women.\r"

In a second session, the subjects were crossed-over to bromocriptine by the alternate route. An additional hyperprolactinemic patient received vaginal bromocriptine only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum bromocriptine and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured hourly for 12 hours in the normal volunteers and for 10 hours in the hyperprolactinemic patient. RESULTS: Circulating bromocriptine levels were significantly higher after vaginal bromocriptine after the 7th hour (P less than 0.05). The reduction in serum PRL was significantly greater after oral administration between 2 and 6 hours.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of oral contraceptive (OC) pills, given for 3 months, on serum gonadotropin, androgen, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 concentrations, and glucose tolerance in seven women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) and in five healthy control subjects. PATIENTS: Seven women with PCOD and five healthy control subjects. INTERVENTIONS: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and after treatment with OC. RESULTS: After treatment with OC, serum luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, and free testosterone levels decreased, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentration increased in the women with PCOD as well as in the control subjects. The cumulative response of serum insulin to OGTT was larger in the women with PCOD than in the control subjects both before and after treatment. Serum IGF-I concentration, which was unchanged during OGTT, decreased from basal level of 326 +/- 70 micrograms/L to 199 +/- 28 micrograms/L after treatment with OC in the women with PCOD, whereas no change was found in the control subjects (from 235 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 226 +/- 11 micrograms/L). Treatment with OC caused an increase of the mean basal IGFBP-1 concentration from 24 +/- 7 micrograms/L to 73 +/- 14 micrograms/L in the women with PCOD. This increase was constant during the OGTT. In the control subjects, treatment with OC did not result in any significant change in IGFBP-1 concentrations (from 44 +/- 11 micrograms/L to 61 +/- 9 micrograms/L). CONCLUSION: The combination of decreased total IGF-I concentration and increased IGFBP-1 concentration induced by OC may decrease ovarian androgen production in PCOD.\r"

We aimed to evaluate the adhesion formation after laparoscopy as compared with laparotomy in a randomized trial. DESIGN: One hundred five patients with tubal pregnancy were stratified with regard to age and risk factors and randomized to surgery by laparoscopy or laparotomy. To evaluate adhesion formation and tubal status, 73 patients with strong desire of pregnancy underwent a second-look laparoscopy. The adhesion status at the ipsilateral and contralateral side at primary surgery was compared with the status at second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: Patients operated on by laparotomy developed significantly more adhesions at the operated side than patients operated on by laparoscopy (P less than 0.001). Substantially more patients in the laparotomy group underwent adhesiolysis at second-look laparoscopy than did patients in the laparoscopy group. Tubal patency did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic treatment of EP results in less impairment of the pelvic status compared with conventional conservative surgery.\r"

DESIGN: We measured plasma lipoproteins in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in 39 infertile women. These women were divided into two groups on the basis of endometrial biopsies; the LPD group had biopsies that were greater than or equal to 3 days out-of-phase. SETTING: All participants were recruited from the Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Clinic at the University of Washington, an institutional tertiary care center. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen women had in-phase and 21 had out-of-phase LPD biopsies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Lipoprotein levels were obtained in a fasted state on the day of the luteal phase on which the biopsy was performed. RESULTS: No difference in covariates that affect lipoprotein levels such as obesity, age, and alcohol use were observed between the two groups. No significant differences between groups were found for triglycerides, total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein, LDL, HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 concentrations. However, LPD was associated with a reduction in the extent to which: age and obesity are associated with higher triglycerides; obesity is associated with a lower HDL2; and alcohol is associated with a higher HDL3-cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Lipoproteins on average are not different in LPD, suggesting reasons other than a deficient plasma lipoprotein cholesterol source as the explanation for decreased P secretion. A lesser interaction between LDL or HDL and obesity, age, and alcohol in LPD could signify an influence of the altered hormonal milieu of LPD on the way lipoproteins interact with covariates and could lead to differences in lipoproteins between normal and LPD subjects at the extremes of the lipoprotein distribution.\r"

A dose-dependent inhibition with and without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) of E2 and P production was observed. The accumulation of pregnenolone was significantly enhanced three to fourfold by 4-OHA in this culture system, as compared with control value. In addition, a sevenfold increase on pregnenolone accumulation was observed in the presence of 4-OHA plus 10 IU of hCG as compared with control values and 2.2-fold as compared with the 4-OHA treatments. These in vitro findings indicate a direct effect of 4-OHA on luteal steroidogenesis. Nevertheless, the suppressive effect of 4-OHA on P and E2 production is located at different sites of the steroidogenic pathway. In addition, the results demonstrate that hCG in the presence of 4-OHA stimulated pregnenolone accumulation, suggesting that the inhibition of P synthesis is in some steps after the formation of pregnenolone. These data indicate that the actions of 4-OHA on P or E2 formation have different inhibitory mechanisms.\r"

DESIGN: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration was delayed by at least 24 hours in patients undergoing superovulation to avoid egg collections on weekends (group 1). Encouraged by the results, a further prospective study in which oocyte retrievals were programmed for only 3 days a week was undertaken (group 2). SETTING: Hammersmith Hospital, a tertiary referral unit. PATIENTS: All patients undergoing IVF treatment were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To schedule oocyte retrievals on either 5 or 3 days per week. RESULTS: Only 4.0% of egg collections (12/303) occurred on weekends compared with 12.6% (22/175) before delaying hCG. In group 2 (n = 215), only four egg collections (2.1%) had to be performed out of schedule. Delaying administration of hCG had no detrimental effects. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed administration of hCG allows scheduling oocyte retrievals on either 5 or 3 days per week, leading to a substantial decrease in out-of-hours oocyte retrievals, reducing cycle costs, and facilitating efficiency. The method is applicable to assisted reproduction specialized units as well as district general hospitals that use gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs in their superovulation regimens before IVF, gamete intrafallopian transfer, or intrauterine insemination.\r"

RESULTS: Overall, the classifications of mean percent normal, small, and amorphous head forms were similar in the two methods. However, the differences between paired values obtained by the two methods were highly variable (range from -20% to +20%). The large differences between the methods were related to the large coefficients of variations present when classifying abnormal sperm morphology even by the same experienced technician. Only the percent normal spermatozoa could be classified by both methods with acceptable precision. In contrast, the variations in the morphometric analyses between the different semen smears were very small. CONCLUSIONS: There was no advantage of the morphologizer over the manual method in sperm morphology classification. The clinical value of morphometric parameters of spermatozoa has to be defined.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sperm morphology was classified both by visual assessment and computer-assisted image analysis. In addition, morphometric analysis of the spermatozoa was measured by the morphologizer. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to evaluate the usefulness of these morphology parameters for predicting the outcome of the zona-free hamster oocyte sperm penetration assay. RESULTS: The manually derived percent of spermatozoa with normal and small head were selected to be of discriminating value in predicting the outcome of the zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test. The accuracy of correctly classifying the outcome of zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test by these two parameters in combination was 84%, whereas assessment of sperm morphology with morphometric analysis by the morphologizer selected a total of eight variables, which together predicted sperm fertilizing capacity with 74% accuracy. Addition of the morphologizer-derived parameters to those derived manually did not significantly improve the predictive value. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the results of the zona-free hamster egg penetration test could be predicted using manual assessment of sperm morphology and computer-assisted morphometric analysis did not add further information.\r"

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A group of 41 men with normal classical semen parameters, included in the IVF program of University of Nice for feminine tubal obstruction (n = 37) or unexplained infertility (n = 4), were evaluated in a prospective study and compared with a control group of 10 fertile donors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of acrosome status (spontaneous and A23187-induced acrosome loss) after 6 hours incubation in Menezo's B2 medium was made by flow cytometry on suspended cells with a new immunofluorescence test recently reported by the authors based on a monoclonal antibody GB24. RESULTS: Spontaneous acrosome loss remained low even after 6 hours capacitation (mean + 1 SD, 6.5% + 4.9%). Response to A23187 increased with the duration of preincubation with a marked response after 6 hours (29.5% + 8.9%). Low spontaneous acrosome loss (less than mean + 1 SD) and high response to A23187 (greater than mean - 1 SD) were observed in 25 out of 26 cases of group A with a high fertilization rate (greater than 50% fertilized oocytes). A high level of spontaneous acrosome loss and/or a lack of response to A23187 was observed in 2 of 7 cases of group B (fertilization rate less than 50%) and 6 of 8 cases of group C (unexplained unsuccessful fertilization). CONCLUSION: Impaired acrosomal status can be associated with unexplained unsuccessful fertilization.\r"

Nondiabetic and diabetic controls and three diabetic groups treated with 10% supplements of corn oil, evening primrose oil (Efamol), or a mixture of 80% evening primrose oil and 20% fish oil (Efamol Marine) for 2 mo were used. Efamol and Efamol Marine increased plasma gamma-linolenic acid levels, but arachidonic acid was elevated only with Efamol. Diabetes resulted in 15-29% reductions in sciatic motor and sensory saphenous nerve conduction velocity. Efamol prevented conduction deficits more effectively than Efamol Marine, and corn oil had no effect. In vitro measurement of sciatic nerve hypoxic resistance revealed a 49% increase in the time taken for action potential amplitude to decline by 50% with diabetes. Corn oil had no significant effect. With Efamol, hypoxic resistance was within the nondiabetic range. Efamol Marine produced intermediate results. Functional improvements may relate to enhanced vasa nervorum perfusion, because endoneurial capillary density increased by 22% with Efamol, angiogenesis perhaps resulting from eicosanoid production from arachidonic acid. Soleus muscle contractions were prolonged by diabetes. This was partially corrected by treatment, Efamol being most effective. Extensor digitorum longus muscle had reduced tetanic tension with diabetes, and this was prevented by all treatments. Soleus showed a modest increase in capillarization with Efamol, which may have contributed to reduced susceptibility to fatigue. The data suggest involvement of abnormal fatty acid metabolism in the etiology of diabetic neuropathy and myopathy.\r"

We examined the effects of modification of matrix by nonenzymatic glycosylation on mesangial cell function. Matrix was generated by growing mesangial cells in tissue culture for 2 wk and removing the cells with a detergent cell-lysis solution. By indirect immunofluorescence and Northern-blot analysis, the remaining matrix contained laminin, fibronectin, and collagens type I and IV. The matrix was modified by incubation for 24 h with 50 mM glycolaldehyde, a highly reactive cross-linking nonenzymatic glycosylation product, or for 2 wk with 200 mM glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Modification was carried out with or without equimolar aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of cross-link formation. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of the matrix by glycolaldehyde or G6P was confirmed by fluorometry and [14C]G6P incorporation and was prevented by aminoguanidine. [3H]thymidine incorporation for 24 h by mesangial cells plated onto unmodified or modified matrix was then performed. Modification of matrix had no effect on attachment of mesangial cells, determined 4 h after plating. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of matrix by glycolaldehyde or G6P significantly inhibited thymidine incorporation by mesangial cells. This effect was partially reversible by aminoguanidine. Aminoguanidine-modified matrix had no effect on thymidine incorporation. Thymidine-incorporation results were confirmed by direct cell counting. We conclude that modification of matrix by nonenzymatic glycosylation influences growth of mesangial cells, which could contribute to the mesangial abnormalities of diabetic glomerulopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations have been identified in the insulin-receptor gene in insulin-resistant patients. We studied two patients with acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance caused by a decrease in the number of cell surface insulin receptors. Patient 1 was an 11-yr-old boy with a fasting insulin level of 2130 pM; patient 2 was a 14-yr-old girl with hyperandrogenism and a fasting insulin level of 580-740 pM. Based on Southern-blotting studies, the structure of both alleles of the insulin-receptor gene in both patients appeared to be grossly normal. There was no evidence of insertions, deletions, or major rearrangements. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of all 22 exons of the gene were normal in both patients. Thus, the predicted amino acid sequences of both patients' insulin receptors were normal. In Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from patient 1, insulin-receptor mRNA levels were so low they could not be detected with an RNase A protection assay, whereas mRNA levels from patient 2 were in the lower half of the normal range. By use of a more sensitive assay based on the polymerase chain reaction, insulin-receptor mRNA could be detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from both patients. Moreover, because of the existence of silent polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences, it was possible to differentiate the two alleles of the insulin-receptor gene in both patients. In patient 2, the two alleles were expressed asymmetrically, with 90% of the mRNA molecules having been transcribed from one allele but only 10% transcribed from the second allele. This suggests that there is an unidentified mutation in the underexpressed allele that acts in a cis-dominant fashion to decrease insulin-receptor mRNA levels. However, in patient 1, both alleles were expressed symmetrically in similarly low levels. Although not proven, it seems likely that the mutations that decrease insulin-receptor mRNA levels in patient 1 also map to the insulin-receptor locus.\r"

After amylin infusion, the contribution of whole-body glycolysis to overall glucose disposal increased from 43-48 to 62-79%, whereas muscle glycogen synthesis decreased significantly at all peptide concentrations greater than 3 x 10(-10) M, completely accounting for the decrease in glucose uptake. Skeletal muscle glucose-6-phosphate concentration rose from 0.219 +/- 0.038 mumol/g (insulin alone) to 0.350 +/- 0.018, 0.440 +/- 0.020, and 0.505 +/- 0.035 mumol/g (insulin plus amylin at 50, 200, or 500 pmol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01).

CIAA+ICA+ first-degree relatives of individuals with type I diabetes have increased numbers of CD4 cells bearing the CD45R antigen and reciprocal depressions of the CD4 cells bearing the CD29 determinant. In addition, depressed CD4/CD8 ratios are present. In this study, we investigated the correlation between autoantibody levels and T-lymphocyte changes in the prediabetic state. The data demonstrate a clear linear relationship between rising CIAA levels, a marker of disease rate, and rising elevations in the CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratio in 37 CIAA+ICA+ and CIAA+ICA- relatives (r = 0.93). In marked contrast, the degree of CD4/CD8 depression found in individuals with prediabetes or long-term diabetes failed to correlate with either CIAA (r = 0.32) or ICA (r = 0.29) levels. The investigation of T-lymphocyte changes in siblings of individuals with type I diabetes with different stable autoantibody patterns (CIAAs and/or ICAs), and thus varying risks for diabetes, revealed differences in the prediabetic groups. Fifteen CIAA+ICA- relatives with high CIAA levels (greater than 80 nU/ml) had high CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratios (P = 0.03) and depressed CD4/CD8 ratios (P = 0.008). In contrast, CIAA+ICA- relatives with low CIAA levels (39-80 nU/ml), and thus low risk of diabetes, had no alteration in their CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.75) or CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratio (P = 0.33).

IDDM patients in NIR remission were recognized when target glycemic control (plasma glucose and mean capillary blood glucose levels less than 7.8 mM before meals) was maintained without administration of insulin for at least 2 wk. In so-called isoglycemic tests, 50 g glucose was administered orally, and the glycemic curve was simulated in a subsequent study by programmed intravenous infusion of glucose. Under these conditions, the subjects with diabetes exhibited obvious glucose intolerance: acute beta-cell responses to intravenous glucose were virtually absent but significant, although subnormal responses were present after oral glucose. The responses of plasma immunoreactive gastric inhibitory polypeptide to oral glucose were normal. After bolus intravenous injections of glucose, the patients with diabetes again exhibited glucose intolerance; acute responses of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide were present, although grossly obtunded. On intravenous infusion of arginine (30 g in 30 min), the patients with diabetes showed substantial but subnormal increases in plasma IRI and C-peptide. Intravenous infusion of arginine elicited increments of plasma immunoreactive glucagon (IRGI) in both groups, and this response was slightly exaggerated in the patients with diabetes. On ingestion of a standard mixed meal (Sustacal) delivering 600 cal, there was a modest but significantly greater increase in plasma glucose levels in the diabetic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) evoked activation of PKC. Basal [Ca2+]i was 65-160 nM. DiC8 induced triphasic increases in [Ca2+]i; phase 2 was the most prominent and consistent one. With 25-150 microM DiC8, [Ca2+]i increased in a dose-dependent manner during phase 2; half-maximal stimulatory dose was 53 microM. TPA did not evoke any increase in [Ca2+]i. Staurosporine, sphingosine, and H7, which are inhibitors of PKC, did not block DiC8-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. DiC8-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was also seen in cells that had been depleted of PKC by prior exposure to TPA. DiC8-induced rise in [Ca2+]i still occurred in the presence of the Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil or when the extracellular Ca2+ had been reduced from 2.5 mM to 30 nM by EGTA. Three immediate metabolites of DiC8, monooctanoylglycerol, octanoate, and glycerol, did not evoke any change in [Ca2+]i. Monooleoylglycerol and R59022, which induce increases in endogenous diacylglycerol (DAG) by inhibiting DAG kinase, evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. DiC8 did not cause any change in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels. DiC8 evoked biphasic increases in insulin release; the second-phase increase in [Ca2+]i preceded the late phase of insulin secretion. Exogenous DAGs should be used with caution in assessing PKC function. Changes in the generation in DAGs must be included among the mechanisms by which Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated in islet cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Whole-body kinetics of 123I-labeled human insulin and five insulin analogues were investigated by scintigraphic studies in rats. The amino acid substitutions and the relative receptor affinities (RAs), determined by binding to HepG2 cells, were: GluB12, des-B30 insulin, RA 0.15%; AspB9, GluB27 insulin, RA 18%; AspB26 insulin, RA 80%; AspB18 insulin, RA 327%; and HisA8, HisB4, GluB10, HisB27 insulin, RA 687%. All analogues were compared with human insulin (RA 100%). The analogue with RA 0.15% showed a significantly slower disappearance in the heart window, no liver uptake, and the greatest kidney radioactivity, the latter probably caused by high plasma concentrations. The low-affinity analogue (RA 18%) reached a surprisingly high hepatic peak value, although significantly lower than insulin. Kidney radioactivity was higher than for insulin. The analogue with RA 80% showed liver and kidney radioactivities that were not significantly different from those of insulin. The two high-affinity analogues (RAs 327 and 687%) showed peak liver radioactivities not significantly different from insulin. However, liver radioactivity after the peaks declined significantly more slowly. Compared with insulin, the kidney radioactivity curves were not significantly different. We conclude that high-affinity insulin analogues will bind to any available receptor that, because of the large number of receptors in the periphery and the distribution of cardiac output, favors extrahepatic elimination. In contrast, low-affinity analogues bind to receptors several times before they are eliminated. This leads to recirculation and, thus, hepatic elimination due to the high receptor density there. It follows that hepatopreferential binding cannot be expected solely by use of an insulin analogue with a particular receptor affinity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute and chronic hyperglycemia on the kinase activity of insulin receptors in vivo were studied in the rat. Skeletal muscle-derived insulin receptors were isolated, with preservation of the in vivo phosphorylation state, from nondiabetic rats subjected to hyperinsulinemic clamps at either euglycemia (mean 5.2 mM) or hyperglycemia (14.4 mM) or from streptozocin-induced diabetic rats at euglycemia (5.1 mM) or hyperglycemia (14.2 mM). Kinase activity toward histone of insulin receptors from nondiabetic animals rendered hyperglycemic for 80-90 min was 50% higher than that of receptors from rats clamped at euglycemia (mean +/- SE 4.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.3 fmol of phosphate into histone, respectively, P less than 0.02), although kinase activity of receptors isolated from animals rendered diabetic for 10-14 days before hyperglycemic or euglycemic clamps showed no such effect. These results suggest that acute hyperglycemia may increase insulin-receptor kinase activity in vivo, possibly augmenting glucose disposal thereby, whereas the chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus results in metabolic derangements that nullify this effect.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of glucose and insulin on the in vitro development of the rat preimplantation embryo was studied by incubating rat blastocysts recovered on days 5 or 6 of pregnancy in the absence or presence of increasing levels of glucose and/or insulin for 24 or 48 h. A differential cell-staining method allowed the separate counting of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells at the end of the incubation period. In a high-glucose medium (17 mM), ICM and, to a lesser extent, TE developments were significantly and irreversibly inhibited. Low insulin concentrations (3 pM) stimulated ICM and TE development in the presence of 1.1 or 6 mM glucose. Higher insulin levels (30-600 pM) in a 6-mM glucose medium, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ICM and, to a lesser extent, TE development after both 24 and 48 h. This insulin-induced inhibition was reversible if insulin was removed from the medium after 24 h. In the absence of glucose in the medium, insulin was neither stimulatory nor inhibitory on ICM growth. Dead-cell occurrence in ICM after a 48-h incubation increased with increasing glucose concentration in the medium. Insulin alone did not increase dead-cell number but enhanced the effect of glucose. These results show that, in the presence of glucose, insulin might be stimulatory (at low concentrations) or inhibitory (at higher concentrations) on ICM development. A high glucose level was also inhibitory and increased dead-cell occurrence. The data suggest that insulin and glucose might interact and modulate blastocyst development as a function of their respective concentrations.\r"

  ".U": "91216593\r", 
  ".W": "The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon remains an enigma. Most evidence favors a local abnormality in the digital arteries as opposed to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The local fault may involve the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which are most important in reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cooling blood vessels increase the sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, increased levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in primary Raynaud's disease, and patients show an increased sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists on finger blood flow. Serotonin has also been implicated, but the evidence is not compelling. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, vasospastic attacks can often be explained by a low arterial distending pressure, a thickened vessel wall, or absence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity. Diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease relies on a typical history and normal physical examination, laboratory studies, and nailfold capillaroscopy. Finger systolic blood pressures during local cooling with ischemia may be helpful to document vasospastic attacks but does not distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is usually conservative. Pavlovian conditioning or biofeedback may be beneficial. When drug therapy is necessary, the calcium channel entry blocker nifedipine or sympatholytic agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and duration of vasospastic attacks in about two thirds of patients, although subjective improvement does not usually correlate with objective testing. Direct-acting vasodilators have not been shown to be of definite benefit. New therapies include prostaglandins, captopril, and the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin. Surgical sympathectomy has not been beneficial.\r"

  ".W": "The present study characterizes cellular calcium stores that are sensitive to norepinephrine and caffeine in arteries from deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rats. Mesenteric arteries from normotensive and hypertensive rats were excised and cut into helical strips for isometric force recording. In calcium-free solution, phasic contractile responses to norepinephrine (5.9 x 10(-9) to 5.9 x 10(-6) M), but not caffeine (0.3-30 mM), were greater in hypertensive arteries. D-600, a calcium channel blocker, or removal of the endothelium did not alter phasic contractions to norepinephrine or caffeine. In contrast, contractions to both norepinephrine and caffeine were inhibited by ryanodine, a drug that depletes calcium from intracellular stores. An inhibitor of phospholipase C (2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate) attenuated contractions to norepinephrine but not those to caffeine. The augmented response to norepinephrine in hypertensive rats did not occur early after implantation of the mineralocorticoid, suggesting that this vascular change may not play a role in the development of high blood pressure in this experimental model. The augmented response to norepinephrine was reduced in mineralocorticoid-treated rats maintained on a low sodium diet, and these rats had blood pressures in the normotensive range. Because contractile responses to caffeine were not enhanced in arteries from hypertensive rats, we conclude that the cellular store for calcium is not enlarged compared with that in normotensive arteries. In contrast, the mobilization of calcium from cellular stores by norepinephrine is augmented in mineralocorticoid hypertension. This augmented response may be linked to altered phospholipase C activity and thus to an augmented action of inositol trisphosphate that releases calcium from intracellular sites.\r"

The reduced acetylcholine response was attributable to inhibition of the NG-monomethyl L-arginine-sensitive but not the indomethacin-sensitive component of relaxation. Relaxation by sodium nitroprusside was not affected by ouabain, suggesting that inhibition of sodium transport, directly or indirectly, must affect synthesis or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor rather than its effector pathway. These results do not support the existence of an additional endothelium-derived relaxing factor other than endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which is dependent on sodium pump activity. The finding that inhibition of sodium transport has a profound effect on vascular relaxation may have implications in the pathogenesis of certain forms of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II, when given in low doses, raises blood pressure slowly. When tested in vitro on vascular smooth muscle cells, it has mitogenic and trophic effects; it is not known if it has these effects in vivo. Our purpose was to determine whether vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II and, if so, whether it is pressure induced. Three experiments were done in rats infused subcutaneously with angiotensin II (200 ng/kg/min) by minipump for 10-12 days. Experiment 1: Angiotensin II gradually raised systolic blood pressure (measured in the tail) from 143 +/- 2 to 208 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), significantly suppressing plasma renin and increasing threefold (NS) plasma angiotensin II. There was no loss of peptide in the pump infusate when tested at the end of the experiment. Experiment 2: In the perfused mesenteric circulation, vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and KCl were enhanced in rats given a slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II, but sensitivity of responses was not altered. This combination of changes suggests that vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II. Experiment 3: Vessel myography was done after angiotensin II infusion with and without a pressor response. Angiotensin II raised systolic blood pressure, increased heart weight, and produced myographic changes of vascular hypertrophy in the mesenteric circulation, increasing media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio. Hydralazine given with angiotensin II prevented the rise of pressure and the cardiac effect but not the vascular changes. Two-way analysis of variance showed that angiotensin II significantly increased media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio, all independent of hydralazine. Thus, although hydralazine inhibits the pressor and cardiac effects of angiotensin II, suggesting a pressor mechanism for the cardiac change, it does not inhibit structural vascular change, which suggests that at least part of the effect has a non-pressor mechanism.\r"

After a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either placebo or 10, 40, or 80 mg fosinopril once daily for 4 weeks. If treatment goals were not met, chlorthalidone 25 mg/day was added for weeks 5 to 8. Thereafter, patients could enter the long-term, open-label phase and receive 10-80 mg/day fosinopril plus chlorthalidone, if needed. After 4 weeks of monotherapy, the average decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure were 9% (10 mg), 11.5% (40 mg), and 12.5% (80 mg) compared with 6% in the placebo group. After 8 weeks, the average decreases, with or without diuretic therapy, were 12.5-18.2%, compared with 10.8% with placebo. Blood pressure continued to be well controlled, and the patients showed no evidence of tachyphylaxis or tolerance through 12-15 months of treatment. Fosinopril was well tolerated. During the short-term phase, no patient withdrew because of adverse events possibly related to fosinopril; during the long-term phase, nine of 148 patients (6.1%) withdrew for that reason. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, once-daily fosinopril (40 and 80 mg) provided significant antihypertensive effects with or without diuretic therapy. The 10 mg dose was effective in some patients and may be considered a starting dose.\r"

  ".W": "Human essential hypertension has more than one cause, but to dissect out subtypes, markers are required. The maximal activity of red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport has been shown to be increased in hypertensive patients in case-control and population-based studies; in the latter, its distribution is a mixture of two overlapping but distinguishable subpopulations. In the present study, we classified 705 participants in the Tecumseh Blood Pressure Study as having either normal (mean, 0.234 mmol/l cells/hr; n = 614) or high (mean, 0.463 mmol/l cells/hr; n = 91) red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport to determine if the red blood cell marker is associated with distinctive physiological characteristics. We found that subjects with elevated lithium-sodium countertransport have higher average blood pressure and a greater prevalence of hypertension than those with normal countertransport and that elevated blood pressure had been present since youth. Hemodynamically, the high countertransport group is characterized by elevated vascular resistance, whereas sympathetic nervous system activity appears to be slightly depressed. Subjects with increased lithium-sodium countertransport, compared with those with normal countertransport, have significantly lower average left ventricular mass index and only very infrequently demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy. Our results support the usefulness of measurements of the maximal activity of red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport as a way of distinguishing subgroups in the population. Our data are consistent with the idea that subjects with an elevated maximal activity for red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport are a subset of the population with a genetic lesion that predisposes them to the development of essential hypertension.\r"

The group with a positive family history of hypertension, in comparison with the normotensive control group, was heavier, had higher blood pressure, increased left ventricular wall thickness, increased left ventricular mass, and signs of changes in diastolic and systolic left ventricular function. There were no differences in these variables between the group with a positive family history and the other two control groups. Data clearly indicated that subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, as well as subjects with mild blood pressure elevation, were heavier than the normotensive control group. It is not possible to judge, with available data, if the changes in left ventricular morphology and function in the two groups with a different family history of hypertension and in the group with mild blood pressure elevation occurred as a physiological response to the increase in afterload or if the neurohormonal and metabolic disturbances leading to the condition of slight overweight also affected left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that dietary intake and obesity stimulate the sympathetic nervous system was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 572 men aged 43-85 years from the Normative Aging Study. Habitus was represented by body mass index, as a measure of overall adiposity, and by the ratio of abdomen-to-hip circumference (abdomen/hip ratio), as a measure of centripetal fat distribution. Sympathetic activity was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion. Increased body mass index and total caloric intake were independently associated with increased 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0055, respectively). In addition, mean urinary norepinephrine excretion was higher in subjects classified as either hyperglycemic (serum fasting glucose greater than or equal to 113 mg/dl) and hyperinsulinemic (serum fasting insulin greater than or equal to 19 microIU/ml) (p = 0.0023) or in subjects classified as either hyperglycemic or hyperinsulinemic (p = 0.0063) than the mean urinary norepinephrine excretion in normal subjects. These relations were demonstrated to be independent of age, smoking status, and physical activity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin mediates sympathetic stimulation in response to dietary intake and increases sympathetic nervous system activity in the obese.\r"

  ".W": "Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure that is thought to be extremely rare among blacks. We demonstrate, however, that in a clinically selected population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension is similar in blacks and whites. We prospectively evaluated 167 hypertensive subjects who had one or more clinical features known to be associated with renovascular hypertension. All subjects had captopril-stimulated peripheral renin measurements and conventional renal arteriography. All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension. Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27). Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25). Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations. Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity. We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography. Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), a potent growth factor in vitro, is present in blood and in multiple tissues and is a major mediator of the effects of growth hormone on postnatal growth. IGF I is internalized and retained largely intact in cultured vascular endothelial cells. Neovasculature transiently expresses IGF I immunoreactivity, but it is not known whether this represents internalization of the circulating growth factor or vascular cell synthesis of IGF I. As an initial approach to defining the role of endogenous production of IGF I in the growth program of the vessel wall, Northern hybridizations were performed with RNA from cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells expressed three primary IGF I messenger RNA transcripts sized 8.2, 1.7, and 0.9-1.2 kb. Bovine aortic endothelial cells expressed one major and one minor IGF I transcript of 2.1 and 1.6 kb, respectively. IGF I gene expression in smooth muscle cells was also demonstrated by ribonuclease protection assays using a rat exon 3 riboprobe. Both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells secreted IGF I, as detected by radioimmunoassay of conditioned medium after separation of IGF I from its binding proteins by gel filtration chromatography. Because IGF I stimulates growth of vascular cells, characterization of IGF I gene expression in blood vessels may be key to understanding developmental as well as abnormal growth in the cardiovascular system.\r"

However, recent data suggest that diaphragmatic afferents are capable of altering ventilatory motor drive as well as influencing perception of added inspiratory loads in humans. This review describes the sensory elements of the diaphragm, their central projections, and their functional significance in the control of respiratory muscle activation. The reflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of phrenic nerve afferents and the contribution of diaphragmatic afferents in respiratory load compensation and perception are considered. There is growing evidence that phrenic nerve afferents are activated under a variety of conditions. However, the significance of this input to the central nervous system is yet to be discerned.\r"

Thirty-two control rats were exposed in the chamber to 1 ATA air. Each rat had 20 sessions in the maze (2 sessions/day for 10 days), and the number of correct (visiting an arm not previously visited to obtain the reward pellet) and incorrect choices (visiting a previously visited arm) were recorded. Statistical analysis showed that the rats exposed to 65 ATA performed significantly better than 1-ATA controls during the first 8 of 20 sessions. This effect was most pronounced in sessions 5-8. Results for sessions 9-20 showed that the pressure-treated rats still made more correct choices but to an extent that did not always reach statistical significance. Possible explanations include the pressure-treated rats performing better because of hunger after a lower food consumption at pressure. Alternatively, pressure itself may enhance proposed mechanisms of spatial memory such as long-term potentiation.\r"

Physiol. 67: 2408-2419, 1989) demonstrated a relatively robust phenomenological relationship between resistance (R) and elastance (E) of lung tissue during external forcing. The relationship can be expressed as omega R = eta E, where omega = 2 pi times forcing frequency and eta is hysteresivity; they found eta to be remarkably invariant under a wide range of circumstances. From data gathered in previous experiments, we have tested the adequacy and utility of this phenomenological description for the chest wall (eta w) and its major compartments, the rib cage (eta rc), diaphragm-abdomen (eta d-a), and belly wall (eta bw+). For forcing frequencies and tidal volumes within the normal range of breathing, we found that eta w remained in a relatively narrow range (0.27-0.37) and that neither eta w nor the compartmental eta's changed much with frequency or tidal volume. Compared with eta w, eta rc tended to be slightly low, whereas eta d-a tended to be slightly higher than eta w. However, at higher frequencies (greater than 1 Hz) all eta's increased appreciably with frequency. During various static nonrespiratory maneuvers involving use of respiratory muscles, eta w increased up to twofold. We conclude that in the normal ranges of breathing frequency and tidal volume 1) elastic and dissipative processes within the chest wall appear to be coupled, 2) eta's of the various component parts of the chest wall are well matched, 3) respiratory muscle contraction increases the ratio of cyclic dissipative losses to energy storage, and 4) R of the relaxed chest wall can be estimated from E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before clonidine (1 microgram in 0.2 ml), contraction-induced reflex increases (n = 10) in mean arterial pressure and ventilation averaged 25 +/- 3 mmHg and 359 +/- 105 ml/min, respectively, whereas after clonidine these increases averaged 8 +/- 4 mmHg and 200 +/- 114 ml/min, respectively (P less than 0.05). Clonidine had no effect on the heart rate response to contraction. Intrathecal injection of yohimbine (10 micrograms; n = 5), an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, but not prazosin (10 micrograms; n = 3), an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prevented the attenuating effects of clonidine on the reflex pressor and ventilatory responses to contraction. Our findings were not due to the spread of clonidine to the medulla, because the reflex pressor and ventilatory responses to contraction were not attenuated by injection of clonidine (1 microgram) onto the medulla (n = 3). In addition, our findings were not due to a clonidine-induced withdrawal of sympathetic outflow, because intrathecal injection of clonidine (1 microgram) did not attenuate increases in arterial pressure and ventilation evoked by high-intensity electrical stimulation of the cut central end of the sciatic nerve (n = 5). Furthermore, our findings were not due to a local anesthetic action of clonidine, because application of this agent to the dorsal roots had no effect on the discharge of group IV muscle afferents. We conclude that stimulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord attenuates the reflex pressor and ventilatory responses to static contraction.\r"

Changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were computed from the pressure waveform using a pulse contour method. To determine possible mechanisms for the changes observed on standing, similar measures were made on passive tilting and a brief (3-s) bout of cycle exercise. Standing elicited a transient 25% (23-mmHg) fall in mean blood pressure as a result of a 36% fall in total peripheral resistance. Head-up tilt elicited a gradual change in haemodynamic parameters, which reached plateau levels in 20-30 s. Cycling elicited a transient 17% (18-mmHg) fall in blood pressure and a 41% fall in total peripheral resistance. In addition, we measured right atrial and esophageal pressures in two subjects on standing and cycling and found a 10- to 15-mmHg rise in right atrial pressure without a corresponding change in esophageal pressure. This points to the cardiopulmonary reflex as the primary effector of peripheral vasodilation, but we cannot exclude the possibility that 1) local metabolic vasodilation and 2) central command-mediated cholinergic vasodilation contributed to the fall in vascular resistance.\r"

Increases in blood pressures during Phe infusions were greater in WT than in UT (100 nM Phe: systolic 36 +/- 3 vs. 25 +/- 3 mmHg, P less than 0.05). The Iso-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure was also more pronounced in WT (0.8 nM Iso: -29 +/- 3 vs. -15 +/- 2 mmHg, P less than 0.01). Iso-induced changes in systolic time intervals showed no consistent differences between training states. Increases in plasma adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate during Iso infusions were smaller (P less than 0.05) in WT than in UT, whereas increases in plasma glycerol were larger (P less than 0.05). Lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor function and binding characteristics did not differ between training states. In summary, the present results indicate that beta-adrenergic vasodilator and alpha-adrenergic vasopressor responses are enhanced in endurance-trained subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A high-speed X-ray scanner (Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor) provided three-dimensional images of the thorax. The contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing was assessed by a comparison of chest wall configuration during relaxed apnea with that at end expiration. We found that expiratory muscle activity was responsible for approximately half of the changes in thoracic volume during inspiration. Paralysis of the abdominal muscles had little effect on the pattern of breathing, including the contribution of expiratory muscle activity to tidal breathing, in most dogs. We conclude that, although there is consistent phasic expiratory electrical activity in both the rib cage and the abdominal muscles of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs lying supine, the muscles of the rib cage are mechanically the most important expiratory muscles during quiet breathing.\r"

To calculate resistances, upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx, and we measured flow with a Fleish no. 3 pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting mask. Both resistances were obtained during a baseline period and during progressive normocapnic hypoxia achieved by a rebreathing method. We collected the breath-by-breath values of upper airway resistances, minute ventilation, O2 and CO2 fractions, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), and changes in functional residual capacity (inductance vest). The central respiratory drive was evaluated by the mouth occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1), and breath-by-breath P0.1 values were estimated by intrapolation from the linear relationship between P0.1 and SaO2. In each subject both resistances decreased during the hypoxic test. The slope of the decrease in resistance with decreasing SaO2 (%baseline/%SaO2) was steeper for pharyngeal resistance than for nasal resistance [2.67 +/- 0.29 and 1.61 +/- 0.25 (SE), respectively; P less than 0.05]. The slope of the decrease in resistance with increasing P0.1 (%baseline/cmH2O) was -0.24 +/- 0.05 for nasal resistance and -0.39 +/- 0.07 for pharyngeal resistance (P less than 0.05). Functional residual capacity progressively increased during the test, but the decrease in resistance was greater than expected from an isolated increase in lung volume. We conclude that nasal and pharyngeal resistances decrease during progressive normocapnic hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 wk old) were divided randomly into two groups: a sedentary control (n = 15) and an exercised group (n = 15). The exercise intensity was 80-90% of maximum oxygen capacity 5 days/wk for 10 wk. Mechanical properties of tibia and second metatarsus (MT) were determined with three-point bending, and contralateral bones were used for geometric and histological analyses. Length and middiaphyseal cross-sectional geometry of the exercised tibiae were significantly less than controls, but material properties were not different. The exercised tibiae had significantly lower structural properties (e.g., loads at the proportional limit and maximum and energy at failure load). The middiaphyseal dorsal cortex of exercised MT was significantly thicker than controls, but tensile stress at the proportional limit and elastic modulus of exercised MT were significantly less than controls. The average number of osteons and osteocytes per unit area of the tibial middiaphysis was significantly greater in the exercised group--especially in lateral and posterior cortices. The number of osteons and osteocytes per unit area in the MT, however, was significantly less in the exercised group. The differential effects of strenuous exercise on tibia and MT suggest that local loading and bone-specific responses have important roles in modulating the response of immature bone to strenuous exercise.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the pulmonary vascular response to endothelin (ET) in rats. In conscious rats, an incremental intravenous bolus of ET-1 (100-1,000 pM) caused, after an initial drop in systemic arterial pressure (Psa), a secondary dose-dependent increase of Psa concomitant with a decrease of cardiac output (CO) and heart rate (HR). Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) remained unchanged, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased significantly only after 1,000 pM (+ 40.0 +/- 10.4 at 15 min). Meclofenamate (6 mg/kg iv) did not alter hemodynamic response to ET (300 pM). After autonomic blockade with hexamethonium (6 mg/kg iv) plus atropine (0.75 mg/kg iv), bradycardia response to ET (300 pM) was blocked, but CO decreased, systemic vascular resistance increased, and PVR remained unchanged as in controls. In anesthetized ventilated rats, bolus injections of ET (10-1,000 pM) induced a transient dose-related decrease in compliance (-10.9 +/- 1.8% after 1,000 pM) but no change of conductance. In isolated lungs, Ppa increased at doses greater than 100 pM, and edema developed in response to 1,000 pM ET. The rise of Ppa in response to 300 pM was not altered by meclofenamate (3.2 x 10(-6) M) but was potentiated by inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) (EDRF), methylene blue (10(-4) M), pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M), and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (6 x 10(-4) M) (3.9 +/- 0.3, 4.6 +/- 0.5, and 5.9 +/- 0.3 mmHg, respectively, compared with 1.5 +/- 0.5 mmHg in control lungs). These results suggest that circulating ET is a more potent constrictor of the systemic circulation than of the pulmonary vascular bed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pressure and flow in the main pulmonary artery were measured in open-chest dogs under chloralose anesthesia (n = 12) with a positive-pressure volume-cycled ventilator. Input impedance was calculated from the pressure and flow waves of heart cycles obtained immediately after the start of inspiration (SI) and immediately after the start of expiration (SE). A lumped parameter model was used to calculate Ca from the input impedance spectrum of the main pulmonary artery. Three levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were used before and after meclofenamate (n = 6) or vagotomy (n = 6). Ca was significantly greater at SE than at SI at each level of PEEP. PEEP increased Ca at SE but not at SI. None of these changes was altered by meclofenamate or vagotomy, suggesting that these differences of Ca were due to passive mechanical effects rather than an active neurohumoral mechanisms. We conclude that Ca is time varying during the ventilatory cycle because it is altered by the dynamic increase of lung volume between SI and SE, but not with the quasi-static increase of lung volume induced by raising the level of PEEP. These changes of Ca were unaffected by vagal feedback or inhibition of cyclooxygenase. We suggest that the increased Ca just after the start of expiration may result from dynamic shifts of blood volume from the extra-alveolar to the alveolar vessels.\r"

We also studied the movement of urea and sodium from blood to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By use of a standard time-cycled pressure-limited infant respirator, mean airway pressure (Paw) was increased from approximately 3 to 17 cmH2O. Urea and albumin transfer into the brain were unchanged with increased Paw. Sodium transport decreased significantly in all brain regions, while sucrose transfer was increased in the cerebrum [transfer constant (Kin) = 3.5 +/- 0.04 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.0 cm3.g-1.s-1.10(6)] at the increased Paw. Transport of urea nd sodium from blood to CSF decreased to half of control values with increased Paw. Thus, in newborn pigs, increasing Paw selectively alters blood-to-brain transport. In addition, movement of tracers from blood to CSF was severely restricted, possibly by a decrease in CSF production. It appears likely that the increased cerebral venous pressure causes the observed changes in tracer transport. Such altered blood-to-brain transport could adversely affect neuronal function.\r"

Two sets of experiments were carried out on groups of five animals. First, one group stayed at rest at 20 degrees C while another group performed exercise for 30 min at the same temperature. Second, one group of animals remained at rest at 20 degrees C for 16 h, a second group was placed at 32 degrees C for the same period, and a third group was subjected to the latter treatment but in addition performed two 20-min exercises. The animals were killed immediately after the experiment. After the small bowel was removed, biopsies were taken for histological examination, and the remaining small bowel tissue was homogenized for biochemical analysis. During exercise performed at 20 degrees C or during exposure to 32 degrees C, the DNA weight (expressed as a function of the protein weight) increased; the specific activity of sucrase, leucine aminopeptidase, diamine oxidase, and maltase decreased; spermine and putrescine content generally decreased; and the weight of mucosal proteins per length of intestine did not vary significantly. When exercise was performed at 32 degrees C, we noted few modifications in the values of the intestinal parameters tested, i.e., changes in only the weight of mucosa expressed as a function of bowel length and, perhaps, the spermine or putrescine content.\r"

Regional measurements were made with positron emission tomography. After hypoxic ventilation of the LCL (n = 11), the LCL-to-right caudal lobe (L/R) PBF ratio fell from 0.94 +/- 0.21 during 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL to 0.46 +/- 0.21 (P less than 0.05). After instillation of either isooncotic (n = 5) or hypooncotic plasma (n = 3) into the LCL, the L/R PBF ratio was similar to that during LCL hypoxia (0.50 +/- 0.27 and 0.64 +/- 0.10, respectively, P less than 0.05 compared with 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL before plasma instillation). The changes in regional PBF due to LCL hypoxia and plasma instillation could be completely prevented (n = 8) by the prior administration of a single dose of endotoxin (15 micrograms/kg iv). In contrast to previous work, these results indicate that perfusion redistribution occurs regardless of the oncotic state of alveolar edema. More importantly, any change that does occur in regional PBF can be completely prevented by blocking regional vasoconstriction, indicating that mechanical compression cannot be the major factor determining the regional response of PBF to alveolar flooding.\r"

These reflex responses of airway smooth muscle have, however, not been clearly characterized during early development. In this study we compared the maturation of reflex pathways regulating airway smooth muscle tone and ventilation in anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated 2- to 3- and 10-wk-old piglets. Tracheal smooth muscle tension was measured from an open tracheal segment by use of a force transducer, and phrenic nerve activity was measured from a proximal cut end of the phrenic nerve. Inhalation of 7% CO2 caused a transient increase in tracheal tension in both age groups, whereas hypoxia caused no airway smooth muscle response in either group. The phrenic responses to 7% CO2 and 12% O2 were comparable in both age groups. Lung deflation and capsaicin (20 micrograms/kg iv) administration did not alter tracheal tension in the younger piglets but caused tracheal tension to increase by 87 +/- 28 and 31 +/- 10%, respectively, in the older animals (both P less than 0.05). In contrast, phrenic response to both stimuli was comparable between ages: deflation increased phrenic activity while capsaicin induced neural apnea. Laryngeal stimulation did not increase tracheal tension but induced neural apnea in both age groups. These data demonstrate that between 2 and 10 wk of life, piglets exhibit developmental changes in the reflex responses of airway smooth muscle situated in the larger airways in response to irritant and C-fiber but not chemoreceptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To do this, we first showed that MK-571 blocked the antigen-induced late response, and then, in a separate study, we determined the effect of MK-571 treatment on airway responsiveness 6 h after antigen challenge (at the start of the late response). MK-571 (5 mg, by metered dose inhaler) given 30 min before and 4 h after Ascaris suum challenge had no effect on the acute response to antigen but blocked (P less than 0.05) the late response compared with placebo (n = 7). In the second study (n = 6), the antigen-induced acute increases in mean specific lung resistance (sRL) were also similar in the placebo (249%) and drug trials (247%). By 6 h postchallenge, however, mean sRL in the placebo trial began to increase (54%, P less than 0.05), whereas in the drug trial mean sRL was baseline. Nevertheless, AHR was apparent in both trials as indicated by a mean twofold leftward shift in the dose-response curves to inhaled carbachol (P less than 0.05 vs. prechallenge). Bronchoalveolar lavage at 6 h showed that MK-571 did not prevent the inflammatory cell influx into the lung. These observations suggest that although LTD4 may be a mediator of the late response in sheep, it is not a primary mediator affecting cholinergic AHR during this period.\r"

Seven untrained women also participated in the 6-wk \"retraining\" phase. In addition, four women from each group volunteered to continue training an additional 7 wk. The initial 20-wk training program caused an increase in maximal dynamic strength, hypertrophy of all three major fiber types, and a decrease in the percentage of type IIb fibers. Detraining had relatively little effect on fiber cross-sectional area but resulted in an increased percentage of type IIb fibers with a concomitant decrease in IIa fibers. Maximal dynamic strength decreased but not to pretraining levels. Retraining for 6 wk resulted in significant increases in the cross-sectional areas of both fast fiber types (IIa and IIab + IIb) compared with detraining values and a decrease in the percentage of type IIb fibers. The 7-wk extension accentuated these trends such that cross-sectional areas continued to increase (nonsignificant) and no IIb fibers could be found. Similar results were found for the nonpreviously trained women. These data suggest that rapid muscular adaptations occur as a result of strength training in previously trained as well as non-previously trained women. Some adaptations (fiber area and maximal dynamic strength) may be retained for long periods during detraining and may contribute to a rapid return to \"competitive\" form.\r"

LDF derives continuous measurements noninvasively, although fiber-optic bronchoscopy is necessary to introduce the LDF probe into the airways. The response of the LDF flow signals at four regions of the airway walls to varying bronchial arterial flow rates was examined in both live and dead sheep by cannulation and subsequent perfusion of the common bronchial artery at different flow rates by use of a roller pump. In the live sheep, variations in bronchial arterial blood flow resulted in variations in LDF signals in the principal bronchus and in lobar and segmental bronchi but not in the trachea. In the dead sheep, variations in bronchial arterial blood flow resulted in variations in LDF signals in all four regions. Within regions, the average response of the LDF signals to varying bronchial blood flow rates was approximately linear in both live and dead sheep, but considerable site-to-site variation in response was observed. In the live sheep, significant LDF signals were observed when the bronchial arterial flow was set to zero and when the bronchial artery was perfused with dextran solution, which would in theory be expected to produce no LDF signal. A small LDF signal was also detected under zero flow conditions in the dead sheep. These observations suggest that the LDF technique, in addition to detecting blood flow from the bronchial artery also detects background noise and/or collateral circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We use this model to calculate the impedance of the respiratory system distal to the carina from impedance data estimated at the airway opening by the forced oscillation technique. Simulations show that the real part of the impedance distal to the carina is uniformly decreased from the impedance at the airway opening, indicating a resistive loss, while the imaginary part is increased as a function of frequency. We estimate parameter values for a six-parameter two-compartment lung model and for a three-parameter reduction of this model before and after the application of the upper airway data to the impedance spectrum. Although compliance terms seem to be minimally affected by the manipulation of the data, resistance and inertance terms are influenced in a fashion that suggests that the resistive contribution of the upper airway to total respiratory impedance is significant. Furthermore it appears that the elastic nature of the walls of the upper airway also impact on estimates of total respiratory impedance at the airway opening.\r"

  ".W": "The electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene muscle (EMGsc) was studied in the supine and upright positions, respectively, during hyperoxic progressive hypercapnic rebreathing (HCVR) in five healthy males. End-expiratory esophageal pressure (EEPes) was quantified on a breath-to-breath basis as a reflection of altered end-expiratory lung volume. There was no significant difference in the slopes of EMGdi, expressed as a percentage of maximum at total lung capacity vs. minute volume of ventilation (VI), between the supine and upright positions [0.79 +/- 0.05 (SE) vs. 0.92 +/- 0.17, respectively]. In contrast, the slope of the regression line relating EMGsc to VI was steeper in the upright than in the supine position (0.69 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04, respectively; P less than 0.005). Positive EEPes at comparable VI at the ends of HCVRs were of greater magnitude upright than supine (3.27 +/- 0.68 vs. 4.35 +/- 0.60 cmH2O, respectively, P less than 0.001). We conclude that altering posture has a greater effect on scalene and expiratory muscle activity than on diaphragmatic activity during hypercapnic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "To provide a better understanding of analysis of arterial (AO) and venous occlusion (VO) tracings, using a constant and nonpulsatile perfusion pressure system, we set up an isolated in situ dog lobe preparation perfused with autologous blood. Four signals were recorded: arterial pressure, arterial inflow rate, venous pressure, and venous outflow rate. The four signals were recorded into the memory of a computer. When flow into the lobe was abruptly stopped (AO), flow out of the lung continued unchanged for approximately 150 ms and then decreased slowly to zero. Likewise, when flow out of the lung was abruptly stopped (VO), the flow into the lung continued unchanged for approximately 130 ms and then decreased slowly to zero. A monoexponential curve was fitted to different stretches of data between 0.1 and 5 s postocclusion and extrapolated to the instant of occlusion (defined here as the instant when flow at the site of occlusion becomes zero). The results indicate that 1) the first 150 ms postocclusion should be avoided because of the oscillatory artifacts generated by the occlusion maneuver, 2) use of a long segment of postocclusion data (5 s) tends to underestimate the middle pressure gradient and overestimate the arterial and venous pressure gradients, and 3) the changes in segmental vascular resistance under different experimental conditions were found to be unaffected by the criteria of analysis. Analysis of the postocclusion (AO and VO) tracings was found to be most compatible with the double-occlusion capillary pressure by fitting a stretch of data between 0.2 and 2.5 s postocclusion and extrapolating back to the instant when flow becomes zero at the site of occlusion but no earlier.\r"

  ".W": "A classical conditioning experiment, in which an auditory stimulus was paired with a hypoxic stimulus, was carried out on 34 normal subjects assigned to two groups (experimental and control). Each subject took part in one session divided into two phases, acquisition and test. In the acquisition phase, eight hypoxic and eight auditory stimuli were paired in the experimental group and unpaired in the control group. In the test phase, which was identical for the two groups, the hypoxic stimuli were suppressed and three purely auditory stimuli were presented. Significant differences between the two groups in ventilatory response to these auditory stimuli provided evidence for conditioning. In the control group, no significant changes were elicited by the auditory stimuli, whereas a conditioned increase in total cycle duration was observed in the experimental group. The conditioned response closely resembled the first component of the hypoxic response. Analysis of the pattern of the conditioned response, along with postexperimental interviews, strongly suggests that this response was not mediated by volitional factors.\r"

  ".W": "This paper examines current concepts concerning \"limiting\" factors in human endurance performance by modeling marathon running times on the basis of various combinations of previously reported values of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), lactate threshold, and running economy in elite distance runners. The current concept is that VO2max sets the upper limit for aerobic metabolism while the blood lactate threshold is related to the fraction of VO2max that can be sustained in competitive events greater than approximately 3,000 m. Running economy then appears to interact with VO2max and blood lactate threshold to determine the actual running speed at lactate threshold, which is generally a speed similar to (or slightly slower than) that sustained by individual runners in the marathon. A variety of combinations of these variables from elite runners results in estimated running times that are significantly faster than the current world record (2:06:50). The fastest time for the marathon predicted by this model is 1:57:58 in a hypothetical subject with a VO2max of 84 ml.kg-1.min-1, a lactate threshold of 85% of VO2max, and exceptional running economy. This analysis suggests that substantial improvements in marathon performance are \"physiologically\" possible or that current concepts regarding limiting factors in endurance running need additional refinement and empirical testing.\r"

The dose was 0.07 U/kg body wt daily. After 6 mo of treatment, significant increases were noted in the rhGH group for total cross-sectional area of thigh muscle (+11.2 +/- 3.1 vs. -0.5 +/- 3.0 cm2; P = 0.015 vs. placebo) and quadriceps muscle (+4.1 +/- 0.8 vs. +0.4 +/- 1.2 cm2; P = 0.031) measured by computerized tomography. Strong correlations were noted between lean body mass (measured as total body potassium) and total thigh muscle area in normal and GH-deficient adults both before and after rhGH treatment. Strength of hip flexors (+1.25 +/- 0.27 vs. +0.25 +/- 0.12 z-scores; P = 0.004) and limb girdle muscles increased (P = 0.02) in the rhGH group. We conclude that 1) rhGH increases lean tissue and skeletal muscle mass in adults with human GH deficiency, 2) this suggests a role for GH in the regulation of body composition of adult humans, 3) the increase in strength of limb girdle muscles after rhGH treatment suggests that adults with GH deficiency may have a proximal myopathy, and 4) the failure to demonstrate an increase in strength in other muscle groups may require the study of larger numbers of patients.\r"

The functional significance of this was examined by incremental cycle ergometry in 24 GH-deficient adults treated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with recombinant DNA human GH (rhGH) for 6 mo (0.07 U/kg body wt daily). Compared with placebo, the rhGH group increased mean maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) (+406 +/- 71 vs. +133 +/- 84 ml/min; P = 0.016) and maximal power output (+24.6 +/- 4.3 vs. +9.7 +/- 4.8 W; P = 0.047), without differences in maximal heart rate or ventilation. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, vital capacity, and corrected CO gas transfer were within normal limits and did not change with treatment. Mean predicted VO2max, based on height and age, increased from 78.9 to 96.0% in the rhGH group (compared with 78.5 and 85.0% for placebo; P = 0.036). The anaerobic ventilatory threshold increased in the rhGH group (+159 +/- 39 vs. +1 +/- 51 ml/min; P = 0.02). The improvement in VO2max was noted when expressed per kilogram body weight but not lean body mass or thigh muscle area. We conclude that rhGH treatment in adults with GH deficiency improves and normalizes maximal exercise performance and improves submaximal exercise performance and that these changes are related to increases in lean body mass and muscle mass. Improved cardiac output may also contribute to the effect of rhGH on exercise performance.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of mean airway pressure (Paw) on gas exchange during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in 14 adult rabbits before and after pulmonary saline lavage. Sinusoidal volume changes were delivered through a tracheostomy at 16 Hz, a tidal volume of 1 or 2 ml/kg, and inspired O2 fraction of 0.5. Arterial PO2 and PCO2 (PaO2, PaCO2), lung volume change, and venous admixture were measured at Paw from 5 to 25 cmH2O after either deflation from total lung capacity or inflation from relaxation volume (Vr). The rabbits were lavaged with saline until PaO2 was less than 70 Torr, and all measurements were repeated. Lung volume change was measured in a pressure plethysmograph. Raising Paw from 5 to 25 cmH2O increased lung volume by 48-50 ml above Vr in both healthy and lavaged rabbits. Before lavage, PaO2 was relatively insensitive to changes in Paw, but after lavage PaO2 increased with Paw from 42.8 +/- 7.8 to 137.3 +/- 18.3 (SE) Torr (P less than 0.001). PaCO2 was insensitive to Paw change before and after lavage. At each Paw after lavage, lung volume was larger, venous admixture smaller, and PaO2 higher after deflation from total lung capacity than after inflation from Vr. This study shows that the effect of increased Paw on PaO2 is mediated through an increase in lung volume. In saline-lavaged lungs, equal distending pressures do not necessarily imply equal lung volumes and thus do not imply equal PaO2.\r"

We used continuous tidal ventilation to obtain dynamic PA-volume loops and used the single-breath-interrupter technique to construct quasi-static pressure-volume loops for the same tidal volume (VT). We used three different VT's (15 and 20 ml/kg and inspiratory capacity) under control conditions and a VT of 15 ml/kg after methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. We found that quasi-static hysteresis was negligible under control conditions for VT of 15 and 20 ml/kg. Quasi-static hysteresis became more important (36 +/- 11% of the corresponding dynamic PA-volume loop) during inspiratory capacity ventilation and after induced bronchoconstriction (27 +/- 12% of the corresponding dynamic PA-volume loop). We conclude that during tidal breathing near functional residual capacity \"true\" static hysteresis is negligible and that purely viscoelastic processes can explain lung mechanical behavior. For higher volume ventilation and after methacholine-induced constriction, quasi-static hysteresis accounted for a more important portion of dynamic tissue hysteresis. This suggests either that a more complex model, e.g., one including plastic processes, should be invoked or that the lung exhibits longer viscoelastic time constants as peak distending stresses become greater.\r"

EELV was increased by applying continuous negative pressure (-10 and -20 cmH2O) around the torso of the standing pony. In all groups, negative pressure produced sustained increases in EELV that were linearly related to the degree of negative pressure. Elevated EELV decreased breathing frequency (f) in N and CBD ponies but increased f in HND and HND + CBD ponies. When EELV was increased, tidal volume was unchanged or above control in N ponies but was below or near control in the other groups. In all groups during elevated EELV, arterial PCO2 initially decreased but then increased relative to control with isocapnia achieved after approximately 1.5 min. In all groups, the elevated EELV was accompanied by increased stimulation of the diaphragm as indicated by increased rate of rise of the integrated EMG (P less than 0.05). During elevated EELV, the duration of diaphragm EMG was reduced, but only in HND ponies was this reduction significant (P less than 0.05). In N ponies, the major effect of elevated EELV on the expiratory transversus abdominis (TA) muscle was an increase (P less than 0.05) in duration of activity and therefore total activity. The work of breathing was thus presumably shifted more to this muscle during elevated EELV. These changes in TA timing were not observed in HND and HND + CBD ponies during elevated EELV. We conclude that elevation of EELV, which presumably places the diaphragm on a less favorable portion of its length-tension relationship, results in compensatory increased stimulation of the diaphragm that is not critically dependent on hilar and carotid chemoreceptor afferents. However, hilar afferents do contribute to the changes in diaphragm and TA duration of activity during elevated EELV.\r"

On separate days before and for 2 h after the 60-s MVC, either a 1-s MVC or electrically stimulated contractions were used as indexes to test muscle performance. Torque at the end of the 60-s MVC was 57% of the initial level, whereas torques from a 1-s MVC and 50-Hz stimulation were most depressed in the immediate recovery period. At this time, muscle biopsy analyses revealed significant decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine and a 19-fold increase in muscle lactate. Conversely, isometric twitch torque and torque from a 10-Hz stimulus were the least depressed of six contractile indexes and demonstrated potentiation of 25 and 34%, respectively, by 4 min of recovery (P less than 0.05). At this time, muscle lactate concentration was still 16 times greater than at rest. An increased phosphate content of the myosin phosphorylatable light chains (P less than 0.05) was also evident both immediately and 4 min after the 60-s MVC. We conclude that the 60-s MVC produced marked force decreases likely due to metabolic displacement, while the limited decline in the twitch and 10-Hz torques and their significant potentiation suggested that myosin phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enhance contractile force under conditions of submaximal activation during fatigue.\r"

To determine whether the hypoxic sensitivity of peripheral chemoreceptors decreases during chronic hypoxia, we measured ventilatory and carotid sinus nerve (CSN) responses to isocapnic hypoxia in five cats exposed to simulated altitude of 5,500 m (barometric pressure 375 Torr) for 3-4 wk. Exposure to 3-4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia produced a decrease in HVR, measured as the shape parameter A in cats both awake (from 53.9 +/- 10.1 to 14.8 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.05) and anesthetized (from 50.2 +/- 8.2 to 8.5 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.05). Sustained hypoxic exposure decreased end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2, 33.3 +/- 1.2 to 28.1 +/- 1.3 Torr) during room-air breathing in awake cats. To determine whether hypocapnia contributed to the observed depression in HVR, we also measured eucapnic HVR (PETCO2 33.3 +/- 0.9 Torr) and found that HVR after hypoxic exposure remained lower than preexposed value (A = 17.4 +/- 4.2 vs. 53.9 +/- 10.1 in awake cats; P less than 0.05). A control group (n = 5) was selected for hypoxic ventilatory response matched to the baseline measurements of the experimental group.

A pre- and postflight paced swim of 182.9 m at an intensity equal to 90% of the swimmers' maximal velocity was completed, and salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), and rated perceived exertion were measured. Blood pressure, HR, muscle soreness, and mood were also assessed at rest on the day before and on the day after travel. Because training volumes for both females and males were greater (P less than 0.001) in the week before W-E than E-W travel, the W-E and E-W data were analyzed separately. Two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed that pre- and postexercise cortisol decreased after E-W travel and increased after W-E travel in comparison to preflight values. Resting and exercise HR responses to air travel were small in magnitude, and their significance depended on the direction of travel. Effort sense was not altered by air travel, but significant (P less than 0.001) improvements in mood and reductions in muscle soreness were observed after E-W and W-E travel for both genders. It was concluded that 1) female and male college swimmers have similar responses to air travel and 2) air travel across four time zones during heavy swim training does not have negative physiological, perceptual, or affective consequences.\r"

The rats were divided into sedentary control (SC), sedentary control with added load (SC+AL), endurance training (ET), and endurance training with added load (ET+AL) groups (n = 10 rats/group). After 6 wk, the SC+AL group had 57% higher (P less than 0.001) beta-glucuronidase (beta-GU) activity and 24% lower (P less than 0.05) citrate synthase activity in white QF than SC. Citrate synthase activity was also decreased in red QF (P less than 0.05) after the added load was used during nontraining hours. The training with added load induced similar but more pronounced changes than normal endurance training, especially in white QF. The ET+AL group demonstrated higher citrate synthase activity in white QF (P less than 0.001) and gastrocnemius (P less than 0.01) and higher malate dehydrogenase activity (P less than 0.05) and beta-GU activity (P less than 0.001) in white QF than the ET group. ET+AL rats also had higher phosphofructokinase (P less than 0.01) and lower creatine kinase (P less than 0.001) activity in white QF than ET rats. In conclusion, the added load without training had minor adaptive influences on muscles. The added load during training hours seemed to be an effective means of influencing the activation and adaptation in muscles that contain fast glycolytic fibers.\r"

This method has the flexibility to fit an appropriate (not necessarily linear) mathematical description of average lung function while concurrently modeling the covariance between measures on the same individual. Differences in lung function growth between girls and boys, pre- and post-puberty, showed that girls had a steadier though less pronounced increase in lung function with height. In boys, before puberty there was deficit in lung volume relative to height (not evident in girls), which was compensated for by rapid growth after puberty. The standard error of FEV1 predictions based on current height and age were more than halved when measurements of FEV1, age, and height taken 1 yr before were incorporated. We found evidence for dysanaptic growth in childhood. Fitted models have application to early detection of departures from healthy lung function.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the fetal pulmonary vascular response to platelet-activating factor (PAF), we studied the hemodynamic effects of the infusion of PAF directly into the left pulmonary artery in 21 chronically catheterized fetal lambs. Left pulmonary arterial blood flow (Q) was measured with electromagnetic flow transducers. Ten-minute infusions of low-dose PAF (10-100 ng/min) produced increases in Q from a baseline of 71 +/- 5 to 207 +/- 20 ml/min (P less than 0.001) without changes in pulmonary arterial pressure. Pulmonary vasodilation with PAF was further confirmed through increases in Q with brief (15-s) infusions and increases in the slope of the pressure-flow relationship as assessed by rapid incremental compressions of the ductus arteriosus during PAF infusion. Infusion of Lyso-PAF had no effect on Q or pulmonary arterial pressure. Treatment with CV-3988, a selective PAF receptor antagonist, but not with meclofenamate, atropine, or diphenhydramine and cimetidine blocked the response to PAF infusion and did not affect baseline tone. Systemic infusion of high-dose PAF (300 ng/min) through the fetal inferior vena cava increased pulmonary arterial pressure (46.5 +/- 1.0 to 54.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and aorta pressure (44.3 +/- 1.0 to 52.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg, P less than 0.01) while also increasing Q. Neither PAF nor CV-3988 changed the gradient between pulmonary arterial and aorta pressures, suggesting that PAF does not affect ductal tone. We conclude that PAF is a potent fetal pulmonary vasodilator and that the effects are not mediated through cyclooxygenase products or by cholinergic or histaminergic effects.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of l-menthol on laryngeal receptors. Experiments have been conducted in 11 anesthetized dogs that breathed through a tracheostomy. We have recorded the activity of 23 laryngeal cold receptors and 19 mechanoreceptors. Constant flows of air, 15-50 ml/s (low) and 100-150 ml/s (high), passing for 10 s through the isolated upper airway in the expiratory direction, lowered laryngeal temperature and activated the cold receptors. This cold-induced discharge promptly ceased upon withdrawal of the airflow. Addition of l-menthol to the airflow evoked, for a similar decrease in temperature, a greater peak activation of the cold receptors than airflow alone (low flows 164%, high flows 111%); statistical significance was reached only for the lower flow. This activity outlasted the cessation of airflow by 30-120 s, even at a time when laryngeal temperature had returned to control (low flow 237%, high flow 307% of similar trials with airflow alone). Four laryngeal cold receptors were also tested with l-menthol added to a warm, humidified airflow that did not change laryngeal temperature; all of them were stimulated with a long-lasting discharge. Nine cold receptors were also tested with d-neomenthol and d-isomenthol; both isomers stimulated the receptors. None of the 19 mechano-receptors tested was affected by l-menthol. We conclude that l-menthol constitutes a specific stimulant of laryngeal cold receptors and could provide a useful tool for the study of their reflex effects.\r"

Two versions of the model were developed. Both incorporated a contractile element that obeyed a Hill force-velocity relationship and a series elastic element. In a quadratic spring version, the series elastic element force was represented as proportional to the square of the stretch; in a cubic spring version, it was represented as proportional to the cube of the stretch. Both versions provided closed-form equations for response predictions that involved four independent parameters. Once the four parameters were chosen, each of these responses could be predicted. Model validity was established by comparing predicted and observed responses in slow and fast hindlimb muscles of rodents. Significant model-predicted responses seldom differed by more than 15% from experimental values. The model can provide insights into how changes in individual properties affect the overall mechanical behavior of muscles in a variety of circumstances and reduce the need for collection of experimental data.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which substance P induces contraction of airway smooth muscle has been the subject of numerous reports. It has been suggested that in rabbit airways the action of substance P is indirect, via the release of endogenous acetylcholine, whereas this is not so in other species. The present detailed study investigated whether substance P-induced contraction in rabbit isolated bronchus and trachea is due to the release of endogenous acetylcholine or in bronchus is due to histamine release and whether substance P is metabolized by the enzymes enkephalinase and acetylcholinesterase. Isometric contraction to cumulative addition of substance P was measured in the presence of 10(-6) and 10(-4) M atropine, 10(-6) M pyrilamine, 10(-5) M phosphoramidon, or 3 x 10(-7) M neostigmine. Neither atropine nor pyrilamine had any effect on the substance P responses. Phosphoramidon, however, produced a 12-fold shift to the left in the response curve with a decrease in the 50% effective concentration from 7.0 x 10(-8) to 6.1 x 10(-9) M (n = 4 control and 5 treated; P less than 0.05). In contrast, neostigmine at a concentration that produced a sixfold shift to the left in the acetylcholine response curve had no effect on substance P responses. We conclude that, in rabbit airways in vitro, substance P-induced contraction is not mediated by release of endogenous acetylcholine or histamine. In addition, endogenous enkephalinase but not acetylcholinesterase may be involved in the degradation of substance P. Our results show that, in contrast to previous studies in rabbits, the mechanism of action of substance P may resemble that described in humans.\r"

In 12 anesthetized dogs hepatic and splenic blood volumes were assessed by sonomicrometry. Vascular pressure-diameter curves were defined by obstructing hepatic outflow. With 10 and 15 cmH2O PEEP portal venous pressure increased 3.1 +/- 0.3 and 5.1 +/- 0.4 mmHg (P less than 0.001) while hepatic venous pressure increased 4.9 +/- 0.4 and 7.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg (P less than 0.001), respectively. Hepatic blood volume increased (P less than 0.01) 3.8 +/- 0.9 and 6.3 +/- 1.4 ml/kg body wt while splenic volume decreased (P less than 0.01) 0.8 +/- 0.2 and 1.3 +/- 0.2 ml/kg body wt. The changes were similar with closed abdomen. The slope of the hepatic vascular pressure-diameter curves decreased with PEEP (P less than 0.01), possibly reflecting reduced vascular compliance. There was an increase (P less than 0.01) in unstressed hepatic vascular volume. The slope of the splenic pressure-diameter curves was unchanged, but there was a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in unstressed diameter during PEEP. In conclusion, hepatic blood volume increased during PEEP. This was mainly a reflection of passive distension due to elevated venous pressures. The spleen expelled blood and thus prevented a further reduction in central blood volume.\r"

The subjects also performed a series of quasi-static muscular actions in a position specific to the bench press movement. A brief perturbation was applied to the bar while these isometric efforts were maintained, and the resulting damped oscillations provided data pertaining to each subject's series elastic component (SEC) stiffness and natural frequency of oscillation. A significant correlation (r = -0.718, P less than 0.01) between maximal SEC stiffness and augmentation to concentric motion derived from prior stretch was observed. Subjects were also observed to perform the SSC portion of the rebound bench press movement to coincide with the natural frequency of oscillation of their SEC. These results are interpreted as demonstrating that the optimal stiffness in a rebound bench press lift was a resonant-compliant SEC.\r"

During the control trial (CT), plasma glucose concentration averaged 4.2 +/- 0.2 mM and plasma insulin remained between 6 and 9 microU/ml. During the hyperglycemic trial (HT), 20 g of glucose were infused intravenously after 8 min of exercise, after which a variable-rate infusion of 18% glucose was used to maintain plasma glucose at 10.8 +/- 0.4 mM throughout exercise. Plasma insulin remained low during the 1st h of HT, yet it increased significantly (to 16-24 microU/ml; P less than 0.05) during the 2nd h. The amount of muscle glycogen utilized in the vastus lateralis during exercise was similar during HT and CT (75 +/- 8 and 76 +/- 7 mmol/kg, respectively). As exercise duration increased, carbohydrate oxidation declined during CT but increased during HT. Consequently, after 2 h of exercise, carbohydrate oxidation was 40% higher during HT than during CT (P less than 0.01). The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain hyperglycemia (10 mM) remained very stable at 1.6 +/- 0.1 g/min during the 1st h. However, during the 2nd h of exercise, the rate of glucose infusion increased (P less than 0.01) to 2.6 +/- 0.1 g/min (37 mg.kg body wt-1.min-1) during the final 20 min of exercise. We conclude that hyperglycemia (i.e., 10 mM) in humans does not alter muscle glycogen use during 2 h of intense cycling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, 22 children (6-12 yr old) and 7 adults (27-40 yr old) performed 6 min of constant-work-rate cycle-ergometer exercise. Sixteen children performed a single test above their anaerobic threshold (AT). In a separate protocol, six children and all adults exercised at low and high intensity. Low-intensity exercise corresponded to the work rate at 80% of each subject's AT. High-intensity exercise (above the AT) was determined first by calculating the difference in work rate between the AT and the maximal Vo2 (delta). Twenty-five, 50, and 75% of this difference were added to the work rate at the subject's AT, and these work rates were referred to as 25% delta, 50% delta, and 75% delta. For exercise at 50% delta and 75% delta, Vo2 increased throughout exercise (O2 drift, linear regression slope of Vo2 as a function of time from 3 to 6 min) in all the adults, and the magnitude of the drift was correlated with increasing work rates in the above-AT range (r = 0.91, P less than 0.0001). In contrast, no O2 drift was observed in over half of the children during above-AT exercise. The O2 drifts were much higher in adults (1.76 +/- 0.63 ml O2.kg-1.min-2 at 75% delta) than in children (0.20 +/- 0.42, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were performed in adults 7-9 mo after surgery and in puppies 18-23 mo after surgery when the dogs reached full maturity. Results were compared with those in age- and sex-matched unoperated controls. Measurements included pressure-volume relationships, pulmonary hemodynamics, rebreathing studies of lung volume, diffusing capacity and its components, lung tissue volume, and pulmonary blood flow. Computerized-tomographic scans were performed in the puppy groups to determine changes in thoracic shape and size. Morphometric analysis of the lungs was performed under light microscopy. There was partial compensation for loss of one lung by functional improvement in the remaining lung. Compensation was greater in those pneumonectomized as puppies than as adults. Volume of the remaining lung was larger than predicted for a given transpulmonary pressure in both groups. Diffusing capacity, pulmonary capillary blood volume, and lung tissue volume were larger than expected for the normal right lung. After pneumonectomy, compliance of the rib cage was greater in puppies than in adults. Weight of the costal diaphragm was reduced in pneumonectomized puppies. Pulmonary hypertension at rest did not develop, and pulmonary vascular reactivity to hypoxia was unchanged after pneumonectomy in both groups. Significant correlations were obtained between physiological and morphometric measurements.\r"

Newborn calves were placed at 4,300 m simulated altitude for 14 days, and control calves were kept at 1,500 m. The HA calves were then reacclimatized to 1,500 m for 24 h so that baseline pressures of the two groups were similar. Open-chest main pulmonary arterial and right ventricular micromanometric pressures, ultrasonic main pulmonary arterial diameter, and green dye flow were measured under baseline conditions and then under moderate and severely hypoxic conditions to make measurements at both baseline and increased pulmonary pressures. At elevated pressures, the pressure-diameter relationship was noted to be nonlinear, and a characteristic late systolic peaking of the right ventricular pressure waveform was seen. The Peterson pressure-strain modulus, pulse wave velocity, characteristic impedance, and global compliance (3 element windkessel) were calculated. The calculated variables were all shown to be pressure dependent, and no intrinsic differences in stiffness were seen between the control and HA animals when mean pressure was taken into account. Pulmonary arterial histology demonstrated, however, a characteristic increase in wall thickness in the HA animals. Thus, in this model of pulmonary hypertension, major changes in elasticity and pulsatile load are primarily due to an increase in pulmonary pressure. The structural changes present in the HA calves' arterial wall did not separately produce any measurable changes in arterial distensibility or the oscillatory load.\r"

The Neb Saline control group had deterioration of the ventilation efficiency index and dynamic compliance values over time as well as pressure-volume curves that demonstrated smaller lung volumes compared with all three surfactant-treated groups (P less than 0.01). Delivery of aerosolized surfactant to the lung was only approximately 2 mg lipid/kg for the nebulized groups, a dose one-twentieth of that previously noted to be effective in instillation protocols.

We found the increase in RL above baseline in response to FMLP to be reduced from 56 +/- 18 to 8 +/- 10% (P less than 0.01) by phosphoramidon (1 mg/kg) and to 15 +/- 6% (P less than 0.02) by thiorphan (3 mg/kg). The geometric mean dose of FMLP producing a 20% rise in RL (PC20RL FMLP) was increased by phosphoramidon from 1.1 to 4.5 mg/ml (P less than 0.05). Enkephalins, which are also NEP substrates, modulate cholinergic neurotransmission in the airway. Inhibition of the FMLP response by phosphoramidon was reversed by coadministration of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg); after atropine (2 mg/kg) the change in RL in response to FMLP was reduced to 7 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01), whereas morphine (0.15 mg/kg) increased PC20RL FMLP to 5.1 mg/ml (P less than 0.05). FMLP-induced bronchoconstriction in the rabbit is vagally mediated, and reduced responses after NEP inhibition may reflect modulation of cholinergic bronchoconstriction by enkephalins. Changes in airway NEP activity may influence the activity of a wide range of its substrates, of which some are bronchoconstrictors and others bronchodilators.\r"

Total pulmonary resistance did not change from baseline with L1 (73 +/- 26 to 71 +/- 25 cmH2O.l-1.s) but increased significantly with L2 (72 +/- 21 to 99 +/- 34 cmH2O.l-1.s, P less than 0.02) secondary to a rise in inspiratory resistance (55 +/- 21 to 109 +/- 55 cmH2O.l-1.s, P less than 0.05). Expiratory resistance did not change significantly with either load. Proximal airway pressure was more negative with L2 than with L1 in every infant (mean -4.5 +/- 0.6 vs. -3.6 +/- 0.9 cmH2O, P less than 0.05). This study shows that the ETA of preterm infants is pressure passive at high but not at low collapsing pressures, and possible explanations include limited \"active\" compensation by upper airway dilator muscles and an overwhelming of the \"passive\" defense offered by the intrinsic rigidity of the ETA to large changes in transmural pressure.\r"

Loading was performed with a continuous flow-resistive load (inspiratory and expiratory), which was approximately threefold greater in magnitude than the intrinsic resistance of preterm infants. VO2, minute ventilation (VE), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtCO2), and transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (PtcCO2) were continuously monitored. Results revealed that VE decreased significantly with loading, from 336 +/- 103 to 231 +/- 58 (SD) ml.min-1.kg-1 (P less than 0.001), while returning to basal levels of 342 +/- 59 ml.min-1.kg-1 after discontinuation of the load. VO2 decreased from 7.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.9 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1 with loading (P less than 0.001) and returned to 7.2 +/- 1.2 ml.min-1.kg-1 at the second basal measurement. PtcCO2 remained unchanged with loading, and PtcCO2 only increased from 39 +/- 8 to 41 +/- 9 Torr (P less than 0.05) with loading, while returning to 40 +/- 9 Torr at the second basal measurement. Results indicate a decrease in the metabolic rate and ventilation with loading, with relatively little increase in PtcCO2. These data can explain prior observations that minimal disturbances in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions occur with hypoventilation during flow-resistive loading in neonates, although the precise mechanism for this reduction remains to be determined.\r"

Cardiac pacemakers were implanted in Yorkshire pigs and set at a rate of 180 beats/min for a period of 35-42 days. Animals were then anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Myocardial blood flow and hemodynamics were determined at three different heart rates (i.e., 120, 180, and 220 beats/min). Tissue samples were then taken for microsphere and biochemical analyses. Chronically paced hearts maintained better cardiac function and had consistently higher left ventricular blood flow with a higher endocardial-to-epicardial ratio. The activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were 23 and 45% greater in the paced hearts, respectively. The sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosinetriphosphatase activity was 55% greater in the paced hearts, whereas the myosin adenosinetriphosphatase was the same as in the control hearts. Polyacrylamide gels of the ventricular myosin isoforms showed only the V3 type to be present in both the control and paced hearts. These findings show that the heart of a large mammal adapts to chronic tachycardia (i.e., 180 beats/min) by elevating the aerobic and calcium-sequestering capacities without altering its myosin type.\r"

In eight experiments, we varied surrounding (pleural) pressure in a dog lung lobe to maintain constant inflation with either positive alveolar and ambient atmospheric pleural pressures (positive inflation) or ambient atmospheric alveolar and negative pleural pressures (negative inflation). Throughout, vascular pressure was approximately 4 cmH2O above pleural pressure. By the micropuncture servo-null technique we recorded interstitial pressures at alveolar junctions (Pjct) and in the perimicrovascular adventitia (Padv). At transpulmonary pressure of 7 cmH2O (n = 4), the difference of Pjct and Pady from pleural pressure of 0.9 +/- 0.4 and -1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O, respectively, during positive inflation did not significantly change (P less than 0.05) after negative inflation. After increase of transpulmonary pressure from 7 to 15 cmH2O (n = 4), the decrease of Pjct by 3.3 +/- 0.3 cmH2O and Pady by 2.0 +/- 0.4 cmH2O during positive inflation did not change during negative inflation. The Pjct-Pady gradient was not affected by the mode of inflation. Our measurements indicate that, in lung, when all pressures are referred to pleural or alveolar pressure, the mode of inflation does not affect perialveolar interstitial pressures.\r"

Subjects received a primed continuous infusion of [6,6-2D]glucose and rested for a minimum of 90 min, followed immediately by 45 min of exercise at 101 +/- 3 W, which elicited 51.1 +/- 1% of the SL maximal O2 consumption (VO2 max; 65 +/- 2% of altitude VO2 max). At SL, resting arterial glucose concentration was 82.4 +/- 3.2 mg/dl and rose significantly to 91.2 +/- 3.2 mg/dl during exercise. Resting glucose appearance rate (Ra) was 1.79 +/- 0.02 mg.kg-1.min-1; this increased significantly during exercise at SL to 3.71 +/- 0.08 mg.kg-1.min-1. On AA, resting arterial glucose concentration (85.8 +/- 4.1 mg/dl) was not different from sea level, but Ra (2.11 +/- 0.14 mg.kg-1.min-1) rose significantly. During exercise on AA, glucose concentration rose to levels seen at SL (91.4 +/- 3.0 mg/dl), but Ra increased more than at SL (to 4.85 +/- 0.15 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than 0.05). Resting arterial glucose was significantly depressed with CA (70.8 +/- 3.8 mg/dl), but resting Ra increased to 3.59 +/- 0.08 mg.kg-1.min-1, significantly exceeding SL and AA values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test the applicability of a dye-dilution method to quantitate total arm blood flow at rest and during arm exercise, indocyanine green was infused at a constant rate into the brachial artery. Eight subjects performed continuous 30-min arm exercises with an increase in intensity every 10 min (30, 60, and 90 W). The loads corresponded to 29 +/- 1, 48 +/- 2, and 78 +/- 4% (means +/- SE) of the maximal O2 uptake (VO2max 2.13 +/- 0.08 l/min) during arm exercise. VO2max during arm exercise was 61 +/- 1.7% of that during leg exercise. The dye concentration was analyzed in blood samples from three arm veins, two ipsi- and one contralateral, at shoulder level. Corresponding dye concentrations in both ipsilateral veins and a stable concentration difference between ipsi- and contralateral veins were achieved. Total arm blood flow was calculated to be 0.21 +/- 0.04 l/min at rest and 2.43 +/- 0.14 l/min at 90 W. Arm O2 uptake rose from 9 +/- 2 to 323 +/- 21 ml/min. Arm blood flow and O2 uptake each correlated linearly with both work load (r = 0.98) and pulmonary O2 uptake (r greater than or equal to 0.98). Mechanical efficiency for the arm and body was 34-44 and 16-19%, respectively. We conclude that arm blood flow can be determined by continuous infusion of indocyanine green.\r"

To investigate lung volumes during low-intensity steady-state cycling, we measured EELV by the open-circuit N2 washout method (MR-1, currently Sensormedics 2100) in eight healthy men while at rest and during unloaded and 60-W cycling. TLC was calculated by adding EELV and IC. Measurement variation of TLC was 142 ml at rest, 121 ml during unloaded cycling, and 158 ml during 60-W cycling. TLC did not differ significantly among the three conditions studied. EELV decreased during unloaded (P less than 0.002) and 60-W cycling (P less than 0.001) compared with rest. End-inspiratory lung volume increased only during 60-W cycling (P = 0.03). The decrease in EELV accounted for 100% of the increase in tidal volume during unloaded cycling. Although minute ventilation was similar in the subjects during unloaded cycling, we noted that breathing patterns varied among the subjects. The increase in respiratory frequency was negatively correlated to the change in tidal volume (R2 = 0.54, P = 0.038) and to the change in end-inspiratory lung volume (R2 = 0.68, P = 0.012). We conclude that TLC does not differ significantly during low-intensity steady-state cycling and that use of IC to estimate changes in EELV is appropriate.\r"

The ergometer generates constant-velocity motion, controlling a force of up to 50 N, over a range of velocity up to 500 mm/s and a distance of 20 mm. This distance corresponds to the range of shortening of the rabbit tibialis anterior muscle from full plantar flexion to full dorsiflexion of the foot, equivalent to approximately 28% fiber shortening. Activated muscles can be allowed to shorten at constant velocity from any point on their isometric force trajectory. Cyclic releases for fatigue testing can be made at rates up to 30 releases/min over a period of 6-8 h. The timing of the release and return strokes of the ergometer is under the control of a digital programmer that also synchronizes the delivery of activating stimuli to the muscle nerve and trigger signals to the recording equipment. An electrohydraulic design was chosen because it is simpler to engineer than an electromagnetic actuator, is reliable in continuous cyclic use, and can be assembled, at least in part, from available industrial components.\r"

Burned animals showed slower weight gains and a 25% to 30% higher resting energy expenditures compared with controls. On postburn day 11, synthesis of secreted hepatic proteins was measured by incorporation of leucine during a 2-hour isolated liver perfusion. Synthesis of total secreted proteins, the seromucoid fraction, and complement component C3 was significantly increased in burned animals, whereas synthesis of albumin was unaltered. In spite of unchanged albumin synthesis, plasma albumin concentrations were 50% lower in burned animals than in control animals throughout the postburn period. These findings suggest that decreased albumin synthesis is not the only mechanism responsible for persistent hypoalbuminemia that follows burn injury.\r"

Therefore no vessel in the major extremity need ever be violated, and muscle function is always preserved. Excision-to-fascia techniques for burn escharectomy should probably be minimized in the elbow region, because if the fascia remains intact, the overlying skin-grafted subcutaneous fat will survive flap transposition as a fasciocutaneous flap. Local flaps allow for earlier rehabilitation, and the donor defect is restricted to the already deformed ipsilateral extremity.\r"

Three groups of mice were randomized to receive water-miscible vitamin E with the resuscitation fluid in doses of 0.5 mg per mouse, 0.167 mg per mouse, or 0.056 mg per mouse. These doses represented approximately nine, three, and one times the murine recommended daily allowance for vitamin E, respectively. Control mice were given saline only. The next day the mice were challenged with 2.5 x 10(5) Pseudomonas aeruginosa beneath the eschar. Administration of vitamin E was continued on a daily basis for a total of three doses and ending the day after bacterial challenge.

  ".W": "For 95 patients with burns the gentamicin dosage regimen necessary to achieve optimal serum concentrations was determined. Individual elimination rates and distribution volumes for gentamicin were determined and correlated with renal function parameters and age. In patients with burns who had normal serum creatinine levels (less than 1.5 mg/dl), gentamicin clearance and thus dosage regimens can be stratified by age. Gentamicin's clearance decreased inversely with age. Initial dosage guidelines were calculated for different age groups of patients with normal levels of serum creatinine. The guidelines were developed to assist the clinician in attaining therapeutic concentrations with initial doses of gentamicin. Therapeutic serum concentrations were reached in most patients with burns dosed by these guidelines. Serum gentamicin concentrations should always be monitored during therapy, and dosages should be adjusted to ensure optimal concentrations during the course of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Longitudinal assessment of the long-term effects of pediatric circumferential truncal burns on subsequent pregnancies is poorly documented. Between December 1967 and August 1985, 75 female pediatric patients with circumferential truncal injuries were admitted to our institution. Twenty-two of these patients were available for long-term follow-up into early adulthood. Seven of these 22 patients had conceived. All seven patients had sustained flame-burn injuries. Mean age at injury was 7.66 +/- 2.12 years. Mean total body surface area of burns was 63.21% +/- 16.69%, with 44.21% +/- 17.54% of the injuries full thickness. Each patient was treated with excision and split-thickness skin grafting during initial hospitalization. In the group of seven patients there were 14 pregnancies. All infants were full term. There were 13 vaginal deliveries and one elective cesarean section. Prenatal complications were limited to one case in which a patient had sustained breakdown of scar tissue during the third trimester of pregnancy. There were no labor and delivery complications in this patient population. Circumferential truncal burns appear to have no impact on prenatal or labor and delivery complications.\r"

  ".W": "We report uncommon neurologic complications of moderate to severe burns in two infants aged 13 and 19 months, respectively. The first patient suffered a 25% total body surface area burn to her lower limbs; 3 days later she became mute and irritable, with increasing rigidity of limbs and trunk. Her face was expressionless and she also had mild dysphagea. Muscle-stretch reflexes were brisk and accompanied by episodes of coarse jitteriness. A diagnosis of an extrapyramidal parkinsonian disorder was made. The infant was treated with amantadine hydrochloride, and she recovered completely over a period of 2 months. The second infant was admitted with an extensive burn to his trunk and limbs; 3 days later he became comatose and had intractable seizures, which were more prominent over his right side. Dysphasia and right-sided hemiplegia became apparent; these conditions were and remained permanent, accompanied by focal seizures and a marked cognitive delay. Although relatively uncommon, central nervous system involvement may be a hazardous complication of burns in infants, who thus represent a high-risk group.\r"

The performance of all of these devices during the behind-the-back reach test was remarkably similar.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the position and size of flotation devices that permit deep-water exercise with the exerciser's thoracolumbar spine in a vertical position and without restriction of movement of the arms and legs. The buoyant force of the flotation device had to be at least 94.0 N to allow the exerciser to be suspended in water with the head above water. The position of the flotation devices had considerable influence on the thoracolumbar angle. When the large pad with a buoyant force of 55.0 N covered the lower abdominal wall and the small pad with a buoyant force at 39.0 N was located over the lower back, the exerciser's thoracolumbar spine assumed an almost vertical position. Anterior placement of the flotation devices resulted in marked extension of the thoracolumbar spine. Conversely, posterior placement of the buoyant devices resulted in flexion of the thoracolumbar spine. On the basis of these results, an ideal flotation device for deep-water exercise can now be developed.\r"

  ".W": "Serial casting is a fast, relatively simple, and inexpensive way to effectively correct burn scar contractures. Plaster casts provide circumferential pressure and a prolonged stretch to contracted tissue and cannot be removed by the patient. When casts are applied well and padded appropriately, there is little risk of pressure areas, since the casts are conforming and do not slip distally. Serial casting may be a successful alternative when low-force dynamic splinting cannot be sized small enough for a child, or when patient compliance is unreliable. A case study of a 2-year-old male patient with severe plantar-flexion contractures of the ankles is presented.\r"

Nurse authors were identified on 18% of all abstracts presented and were primary authors of 7.7% of all abstracts presented. Those who collaborated most frequently with nurse authors were other nurses (41%) and physicians (37%). Descriptive studies were most frequently presented, followed first by reports and then by experimental designs. Fewer than one half of the reported studies possessed statistical support for their findings. Nurse authors are most frequently investigating issues of direct patient care, such as wound management, medications, complications, and psychosocial issues.\r"

A study was designed to measure general knowledge of tap-water injury and awareness of tap-water temperatures in homes. All those surveyed realized the potential for tap-water scald burns in their homes, and few believed that they could tolerate hot-only tap water at home for as long as 30 seconds. Respondents who had previous experience with tap-water burns had not lowered the settings of their water-heater thermostats. Economical but effective programs must be developed to encourage burn-reduction behaviors in high-risk groups.\r"
