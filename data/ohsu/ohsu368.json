  ".W": "In a retrospective analysis of 50 patients with segmental or lobar atelectasis of the lung, chest radiographs and CT studies were compared for their abilities to distinguish whether a centrally obstructing tumor was the cause. This was done to help define the role of CT in evaluating patients with atelectasis. Atelectasis was caused by an obstructing tumor in 27 cases and a variety of other conditions in 23. The chest radiograph correctly identified an obstructing tumor as the cause of atelectasis in 24 of 27 patients on the basis of the presence of a central hilar mass or obvious bronchial abnormality; there was 89% sensitivity and 96% specificity with a 12% false-negative rate and a 4% false-positive rate. CT correctly identified all 27 obstructing carcinomas on the basis of the presence of either a central bronchial abnormality or a central hilar mass; there was 100% sensitivity and 87% specificity with a 0% false-negative rate and a 10% false-positive rate. Absence of air bronchograms or the presence of mucus-filled bronchi within the atelectatic lung were secondary CT findings that also favored the presence of an obstructing tumor. Although the chest radiograph was more specific than CT for tumor as the cause of atelectasis (96% vs 87%, respectively), it was less sensitive than CT for tumor (89% vs 100%, respectively) resulting in missed tumor diagnoses. CT identified all cases caused by obstructing tumor and successfully excluded obstructing tumor in most of the remaining cases, with an acceptable number of false-positive tumor diagnoses (10%). CT should be performed when the cause of segmental or lobar atelectasis cannot be established with certainty on the basis of the chest radiograph.\r"

We performed color-flow Doppler sonography in 16 patients with Graves disease and compared the results with those in 15 normal volunteers and 14 patients with other thyroid diseases (eight with multinodular goiter, four with focal masses, and two with papillary thyroid carcinoma). All 16 Graves disease patients exhibited a pulsatile pattern we call \"thyroid inferno.\" This pattern consists of multiple small areas of intrathyroidal flow seen diffusely throughout the gland in both systole and diastole. In systole, both high-velocity flow (color coded white) and lower velocity flow (color coded red and blue) were noted. In diastole, fewer areas of flow and lower velocity flow were noted. Patients with Graves disease also exhibited color flow around the periphery of the gland. The inferno pattern did not occur in normal subjects or in patients with other thyroid diseases. On occasion, focal areas of intrathyroidal flow were detected in patients with multinodular goiter and focal thyroid masses. High-resolution gray-scale images did not show the small vascular channels from which the flow signal originated. Color-flow Doppler sonography shows promise as a cost-effective, noninvasive technique for diagnosing Graves disease.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic transplantation, performed to avert or delay the long-term complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is sometimes complicated by the development of intraabdominal fluid collections. We performed 33 sonographically guided and CT-guided percutaneous abdominal aspiration and drainage procedures in 22 transplant patients; 25 procedures were done with the pancreatic graft-in-situ, and eight were done after removal of the transplant. All 11 percutaneous aspirations performed in 10 patients were successful in obtaining microbiologic culture material, and there were no complications. Sixteen percutaneous catheter drainages were performed in 13 patients with the graft-in-situ. Subsequent surgical intervention was avoided after only five (31%) of these drainage procedures. However, further intervention was unnecessary after five (83%) of six percutaneous catheter drainages in five patients who had previously undergone transplant pancreatectomy. No significant short-term or long-term complications were identified. Guided percutaneous aspiration of abdominal fluid collections after pancreatic transplantation is a safe and effective means of obtaining diagnostic material, and guided catheter drainage is definitive treatment in approximately one-third of procedures with the graft-in-situ and in most procedures done after removal of the graft.\r"

The scintigraphic studies were performed in 37 recipients of simultaneous renal and pancreatic allografts harvested from the same donor. 99mTc-SC was used as an indicator of thrombotic vasculitis; pancreatic perfusion and blood-pool parameters were monitored with 99mTc-GH. In 11 of the 37 recipients, scintigraphic abnormalities suggested posttransplantation infarction. Recurrent episodes of acute rejection of the pancreatic allograft, which always coincided with acute rejection of the renal allograft, were monitored in 24 recipients. Rejection-induced ischemic pancreatitis was suggested in 12 of the 24 recipients and persisted in 10 recipients for several weeks after improvement of renal allograft rejection. Pancreatic atrophy was suggested scintigraphically in 16 of the 24 recipients with recurrent episodes of rejection. Spontaneous pancreatic-duct obstruction and obstructive pancreatitis were associated with a scintigraphic pattern similar to that of rejection-induced ischemic pancreatitis. We concluded that the specific radionuclides used in this series are useful for the surveillance and assessment of posttransplantation pancreatic infarction, acute rejection, pancreatitis, and atrophy.\r"

In 14 patients with focal splenic lesions, differences between splenic and lesion signal intensities permitted detection of splenic lesions on MR images, either because of cystic or necrotic areas lengthening T2 within the tumor, because of T1 shortening from tumor-associated hemorrhage, or because of T2 shortening of surrounding spleen in two cases of suspected transfusional iron overload. In one spleen, a lesion appeared isointense on both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences and was detected only by gross splenic deformity. In one other case, CT defined splenic metastases not visible on MR images. Measurements of signal intensity of normal spleens and tumor are so similar that spin-echo MR imaging can underestimate the size and extent of focal splenic disease or may miss lesions entirely. We conclude that MR imaging is a less sensitive technique for detecting focal lesions of the spleen than for detecting focal hepatic lesions.\r"

Six of these also had elevated amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein. All fetuses in this series were anatomically normal at time of delivery; one aborted fetus was triploid. Of the 25 pregnancies, 16 had sonographically demonstrable placental hemorrhage, eight retroplacental and eight subchorionic. One had hydropic changes in the placenta associated with triploidy. Of the subgroup of six pregnancies in which both serum and amniotic fluid values were elevated, one had a retroplacental hemorrhage, one had a subchorionic hemorrhage, and one had diffuse hydropic changes in the placenta. A control group of 112 patients with normal alpha-fetoprotein levels yielded four with small (less than 2 cm3) subchorionic hemorrhage. The occurrence rate of placental hemorrhage in women with elevated alpha-fetoprotein and normal fetus was 64%, whereas the control group of patients with normal alpha-fetoprotein had a 3.6% occurrence rate of placental hemorrhage. Sonographically detectable placental abnormalities may be associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein in serum and/or amniotic fluid samples. Such abnormalities may occur because of fetomaternal admixture associated with placental hemorrhage and/or intraamniotic bleeding resulting from subchorionic hemorrhage.\r"

Among our patients the most characteristic sonographic findings of infarction were absence of gyral definition, absence of vascular pulsations, altered parenchymal echogenicity, and territorial distribution. Mass effect, reflected in ventricular size and shift of midline structures, may also be seen and largely parallels the extent of the infarction. Evolution of infarcts was seen sonographically as gradual return of arterial pulsations and concurrent development of cystic spaces. Sonography was found to be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of infarction in infancy and in monitoring its evolution, although CT was necessary for adequate initial evaluation in older infants.\r"

A controlled double-blind trial was conducted comparing the effects of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) and nifedipine in patients with documented transient ischemic episodes. Seventy-five percent of the ischemic episodes were not accompanied by pain. Twenty patients with documented coronary heart disease were included; 15 finished the 4-week study (1 patient had headaches, 1 thyrotoxicosis, 1 hypertensive crisis and 2 unstable angina). On a dual-channel FM-recorded electrocardiogram, ischemic episodes were counted when ST deviation was greater than 1 mm for greater than 1 minute. Patients received IS-5-MN (20 mg 3 times a day or 50 mg in a sustained-release tablet) or nifedipine (20 mg in a sustained-release tablet 3 times a day) in random order over four 1-week periods. At the end of each week, Holter monitoring was repeated and showed reductions of episodes by 67% and 67% after weeks of IS-5-MN therapy and 56% and 58% after weeks of nifedipine therapy (all p less than 0.05). Painful and painless episodes were reduced to a similar extent. Individual responses showed great variability, and in all treatment periods not more than half of the patients were completely free of ischemic episodes. One of the 12 patients did not respond to either way of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio declined 45% after the fat + protein meal. At 180 min, absolute ratio values were twofold higher after carbohydrate (sucrose 0.133 and starch 0.127) than after fat + protein (0.057). Similar results were found with the same meals given in the evening. Our results suggest that high-carbohydrate meals have an influence on serotonin synthesis. We predict that carbohydrates with a high glycemic index would have a greater serotoninergic effect than carbohydrates with a low glycemic index.\r"

One tumor was associated with, and may have arisen from, an adenomyoepithelial type of adenosis. Despite relatively bland cytologic features, one lesion recurred three times over the course of seven years. Follow-up for the other two patients is of short duration.

Unlike the majority of the reported mouse monoclonal antibodies obtained to similar immunogens, these rat monoclonal antibodies showed an unexpected degree of specificity, i.e., they stained only stratified squamous epithelia and not simple epithelia nor urothelia. The potential of using rats and the appropriate immunogen to generate more tissue-specific anticytokeratin monoclonal antibodies is discussed.\r"

Eighteen months later this transformed into acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with disappearance of hemoglobin H, and shortly thereafter he had myelofibrosis develop. Acquired hemoglobin H disease, which is an alpha-thalassemia-like syndrome, results in the formation of an unstable hemoglobin composed of beta chain tetramers. This condition has been associated with preleukemia, sickle cell anemia, and hematologic malignancies. Although idiopathic myelofibrosis also has been described as a setting in which this thalassemic syndrome occurs, the present case is unusual in that the myelofibrosis was preceded by refractory anemia with leukemic transformation.\r"

Six of the live-born infants with abnormal results of antenatal ultrasound examinations had a normal urinary tract after birth. Of the remaining 42 infants, the prenatal diagnosis was confirmed with renal ultrasound and other studies during the first week of life. Twenty-one of 42 infants had bilateral renal disease. We obtained follow-up data on 19 of 21 of these infants. Twelve of 19 had obstructive uropathy that was treated surgically. After one to 51 (mean, 18) months of follow-up, renal function varied. Ten of 19 patients had a calculated glomerular filtration rate greater than or equal to 79 mL/min/1.73 m2. One infant required long-term ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Renal function (glomerular filtration rate, 74 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m2) and growth (height percentile, 41 +/- 8) were unexpectedly good considering the severity of the urinary tract abnormalities. Prenatal detection of bilateral renal disease followed by careful medical and surgical management results in a favorable outcome with good growth and renal function.\r"

At the end of therapy, 91% of patients treated with amoxycillin demonstrated clearance of the organism from the antrum, compared with 16% in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Active antral gastritis resolved in 68% of patients in the amoxycillin group versus only 9% in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). No significant difference was observed when looking at the evolution of chronic only gastritis. No significant improvement was observed in the assessment of clinical symptoms and endoscopic appearance. Reappearance of C. pylori and significant worsening of the histological score of active gastritis was observed after 2 wk in all patients. In a second study phase, 18 patients initially not cleared of their bacteria received amoxycillin single blind for 14 days. Clearance of bacteria associated with improvement or resolution of active gastritis was observed in 72% of the cases. In this subgroup, all patients investigated after 1 month were recolonized with C. pylori and, again, had histological active gastritis. We conclude that amoxycillin is effective in treating active antral gastritis associated with C. pylori, but not in preventing relapses, which occur in all cases within 1 month after therapy.\r"

On the other hand, patients with Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy or external biliary drainage revealed the impairment of fat metabolism, although the response patterns were different. As for the changes in gastrointestinal hormones in the two groups, both gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and insulin levels were reduced, whereas glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) levels rose, especially in the external biliary drainage group. It is considered that the disturbance of fat metabolism, in cases of internal or external biliary diversion, is closely related to change in GIP, insulin, and GLI release, in addition to the impairment of mixed micelle formation by bile and of hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes.\r"

The full endocrine data reported here also demonstrate that reductions in insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide are most significant when guar and acarbose are used in combination. The results are divergent for enteroglucagon when guar and acarbose were given singly. Raised enterglucagon levels seen after acarbose are in keeping with inhibition of proximal absorption resulting in more distal absorption of carbohydrate. However, with viscous fiber, the enteroglucagon response was reduced, and this reduction was maintained even after addition of acarbose. The results demonstrate that the gut endocrine response can be manipulated by pharmacological interventions which alter the pattern of carbohydrate absorption.\r"

As a control, changes of portal venous flow and portohepatic gradient after drinking 227 ml of water, were studied. Portal and superior mesenteric venous flows increased significantly at 30 min after glucose intake, and they returned gradually to the basal values, whereas no significant postprandial change occurred in splenic venous flow. The sum of superior mesenteric and splenic venous flows was greater than the estimated portal venous flow before glucose intake, and the difference widened during post-prandial mesenteric hyperemia, indicating an increase of blood flow into the portal-systemic shunts. After glucose intake, portohepatic gradient elevated immediately, in parallel with an increase of portal venous flow, and these changes persisted for the 30 min studied; however, no significant change occurred in these parameters after drinking water. In conclusion: 1) In patients with cirrhosis, hyperemia occurs in the intestine but not in the spleen after glucose intake, and 2) postprandial mesenteric hyperemia causes an increase of portal venous inflow, portal-systemic collateral flow, portal venous flow, and an elevation of portohepatic gradient.\r"

  ".U": "88161100\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of the gastric mucosa to resist autodigestion has been recognized for over 200 years. Since these early observations, several components of gastroduodenal defense against injury from damaging luminal contents have been identified. The first line of defense is the thick layer of mucus gel into which bicarbonate is secreted by the underlying epithelial cells. The \"mucus-bicarbonate\" barrier sustains a pH gradient between the lumen and cell surface such that epithelial cells are maintained at pH 7 to 8, despite the presence of intraluminal acid. The epithelial cells form a second line of defense; since the pH gradient may be overwhelmed by physiologic concentrations of intraluminal acid, this mechanism may be important in maintaining mucosal integrity. The physical properties of the apical cell membrane and intercellular junctions and the presence of surface-active phospholipids on the membrane may be responsible for preventing hydrogen ions (H+) from diffusing into the mucosa by providing a physical barrier to their movement. Furthermore, epithelial cells are capable of rapid turnover and migration and may breach a defect in the epithelium within hours. The aftermath of mucosal damage may generate a further defense mechanism: a thick layer of mucus containing sloughed epithelial cells together with passive movement of bicarbonate-rich fluid from the damaged mucosa. This may prevent exposure of undamaged cell nests to acid and thus aid re-epithelialization. Finally, mucosal blood flow plays a vital role in maintaining epithelial integrity. Studies have shown that increasing or decreasing mucosal blood flow will, respectively, reduce or enhance susceptibility to damage. Although the precise physiologic control mechanisms for mucosal protection have not been defined, there is evidence that local endogenous prostaglandin metabolism may play an important role [4]. The release of neurotransmitters and hormones may also contribute to or modulate the defense mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases may cause gastric mucosal damage. Although the best-studied agent is aspirin, the mechanisms by which it damages the gastric mucosa are not fully understood. However, it is thought that the drug impairs mucosal defenses by penetrating the protective mucous and bicarbonate layers and damaging the epithelial lining cells. In turn, gastric acid is permitted to pour through the breached defenses. This \"back-diffusion\" of acid further injures cells and destroys capillaries and venules. This local damaging effect is pH dependent and is contributed to by the acid secretion of the stomach. Other mechanisms by which aspirin may induce or contribute to mucosal injury include inhibition of mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, reduction and alteration of mucus secretion, reduction of bicarbonate secretion, interference with cell turnover, as well as systemic effects such as platelet dysfunction. The mechanism by which nonaspirin NSAIDs cause gastrointestinal damage is uncertain. All are known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which could contribute to their toxicity since prostaglandins found in the stomach both inhibit acid secretion and have mucosal defensive effects. Partial protections against aspirin-induced or other NSAID-induced gastric mucosal damage has been demonstrated, at least in some studies, by sucralfate, prostaglandins, omeprazole and histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists. Sucralfate appears to act primarily on local defensive mechanisms; its antisecretory effects are minimal. Prostaglandins exert a protective effect at both antisecretory and nonantisecretory (cytoprotective) doses, indicating that either or both mechanisms may be involved. The most recently studied agent, omeprazole, is the most potent of all acid inhibitors; it may also be cytoprotective, possibly as a result of its effects on sulfhydryl groups. Prostaglandins and omeprazole are not available in the United States and their potential side effects may limit their use in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases. Protection by H2-receptor antagonists is mostly related to reduction of acid secretion, though a cytoprotective effect may occur.\r"

  ".W": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) relieve rheumatic pain and are in extensive use. Symptomatic complications of NSAIDs requiring the discontinuation of their use occur in 2 to 10 percent of patients with rheumatic diseases in sharp contrast to the common asymptomatic problems of gastroduodenal erosions, ulcerations, and bleeding, with resulting anemia in more than 40 percent of these patients. Opinions concerning the clinical significance of these complications are not uniform. The natural history of the effects of NSAIDs on the gastroduodenal mucosa reveals a sequence of initial subepithelial hemorrhage over a 24-hour period followed by gastroduodenal erosions and ulcerations in the next two weeks. From one week to three months, gastroduodenal erosions and ulcerations disappear in about half of the patients as an adaptation to continuing NSAID ingestion occurs. Hemorrhage may occur at any time in most patients and in a small minority (1 percent) it is massive. Non-aspirin NSAIDs (NANSAIDs) exhibit significantly fewer complications than do aspirin. These complications, however, demand considerable clinical attention and are ordered in a constant hierarchy, suggesting variable risks of complications among agents. NSAIDs are a blessing for those who have chronic pain, but that blessing does not prevent significant asymptomatic complications in the same patients. Prophylaxis for high-risk groups, such as women over the age of 65 years, should be subjected to study.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitriol was compared with placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in a double-blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial of 24 months' duration. Adjustment was made in dietary calcium to maximize the dose of calcitriol. The study was completed by 15 patients who received placebo and 12 patients who received calcitriol. The calcitriol group had positive slopes (compared with negative slopes for the placebo group) for total body calcium, bone mineral content of the radius, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, and radiographic absorptiometry of the middle phalanges. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant for each of these measurements. The fracture rate in the treatment group was 250 per 1,000 patient-years as compared with 333 for the placebo group. The mean dose of calcitriol was 0.8 micrograms per day. Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and perhaps nephrolithiasis were observed as complications of treatment. Calcitriol increased bone mineral density by decreasing bone resorption, but not by increasing bone formation. Future studies should concentrate on treatment with oral calcitriol in lower doses. It would also be of interest to examine parenteral administration of calcitriol. It is possible that bone formation can be increased by achieving higher serum levels of the drug, whereas complications may be avoided by using a non-oral route of administration.\r"

Almitrine bismesylate is a peripheral chemoreceptor agonist that improves arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) in patients with COPD during wakefulness. Studies conducted for up to six months suggested the agonist may be useful in the management of nocturnal hypoxemia. In this double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study, patients with COPD received 50 mg of almitrine bismesylate (n = 9) or placebo (n = 11) twice a day for one year. Almitrine bismesylate increased PaO2 by 8.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension by 3.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), and increased minute ventilation by 3.1 +/- 0.5 liters/minute (mean +/- SEM) during wakefulness. All of these changes were statistically significant. Five patients in the almitrine bismesylate group and eight patients in the placebo group completed sleep studies prior to and after 56, 180, and 360 days of almitrine bismesylate or placebo administration. Relative to placebo, almitrine bismesylate significantly increased oxygen saturation during sleep without any significant changes in the quantity or quality of sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium is a component of many metabolic reactions. By blocking calcium transport across cell membranes, calcium channel antagonists can therefore theoretically affect numerous metabolic and hormonal processes. In vitro studies have often documented just such an effect. Because of the expanding use and prevalence of calcium antagonists in clinical practice, a review of their in vivo effects on hormones and metabolism is warranted. The effect on glucoregulatory hormones, calcium regulatory hormones, anterior and posterior pituitary secretion, the renin-angiotensin axis, plasma catecholamines, and plasma lipids and lipoproteins is herein reviewed. The various calcium antagonists, by virtue of their distinct chemical structures, influence metabolism in their own unique manner. Despite the widespread involvement of calcium in hormone action, however, calcium channel antagonists have little dramatic impact on hormone regulation. This is, in part, due to the drug dosage used in clinical practice and to the inherent compensatory mechanisms built into normal endocrine function. The development of agents with greater and more potent metabolic specificity, however, coupled with the ability to target drug action, holds promise for expanded therapeutic application in the future.\r"

  ".U": "88161122\r", 
  ".W": "The epidemiologic link between obesity and hypertension is more clearly emerging to be one between insulin resistance and hypertension. Relative insulin resistance occurs not only in obese hypertensive patients but also in non-obese lean essential hypertensive patients. Although insulin has complex actions on the circulation, plausible mechanisms by which insulin might raise blood pressure include renal sodium retention and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. However, the evidence that insulin can actually raise blood pressure in the long-term is lacking. Since hypertension does not develop in all obese or insulin-resistant subjects, the relationship must be modulated by other genetic or environmental factors. Obesity, diminished physical conditioning, aging, and diabetes are ubiquitous contributors to relative insulin resistance and all are associated with a tendency for blood pressure to rise. Conditions and agents associated with acquired insulin resistance and secondary forms of hypertension include pregnancy, oral contraceptives, acromegaly, and glucocorticoids. Although type 2 non-insulin-dependent diabetes is a state of increased insulin resistance, hypertension is partly sustained by secondary renal mechanisms. Future research should identify the genetic and environmental determinants of insulin resistance in hypertension and utilize these in therapy.\r"

The objectives were to determine whether a broad-spectrum penicillin was as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin and whether two beta-lactam antibiotics were more effective than one. Four hundred and seventy of the 519 febrile episodes entered in the study could be evaluated for response. Ceftazidime plus vancomycin was significantly more effective than piperacillin plus vancomycin, considering all febrile episodes (79 percent versus 61 percent, p = 0.001), documented infections (79 percent versus 57 percent, p = 0.004), gram-negative infections (88 percent versus 47 percent, p = 0.001), and bacteremias (81 percent versus 51 percent, p = 0.01). The addition of piperacillin to ceftazidime (piperacillin plus ceftazidime and vancomycin versus ceftazidime plus vancomycin) did not improve the response rate and was associated with a significantly higher incidence of skin rash. Vancomycin plus ceftazidime provides adequate antibiotic coverage for initial treatment of fever in neutropenic patients. This combination was equally effective, less expensive, and less toxic than the double beta-lactam combination used in this study.\r"

With 400 mg, ketoconazole resulted in 23.2 percent successes, which was similar to 32.1 percent successes with 800-mg treatments (p = 0.29). An additional six of 23 patients in whom initial therapy failed and who later received 1,200 or 1,600 mg per day of ketoconazole also showed improvement. However, among patients completing successful courses of therapy, relapses were more frequent in those requiring higher than 400-mg dosages for their success. From these studies, it is concluded that ketoconazole in doses above those currently recommended offer little or no benefit for most patients with non-meningeal forms of coccidioidomycosis.\r"

A prenatal fetal diagnosis of obstruction was made in 13 patients (12 obstructions located in the duodenum and one in the jejunum). The mean gestational age at prenatal diagnosis was 33.7 weeks (range 27 to 37 weeks). The course of those infants with the prenatal diagnosis made by ultrasound was compared with that of those infants in whom the diagnosis was established after the onset of symptoms of obstruction appeared. Such a prenatal diagnosis resulted in earlier surgical intervention (1.8 versus 3.9 days). Metabolic complications secondary to repeated vomiting were found to be less frequent. The expectant mother in whom such a fetal prenatal diagnosis has been made can be transported to a tertiary level perinatal center where neonatal and specialized surgical expertise are available. After birth, the infant can undergo immediate operation without being separated from its mother.\r"

The 5-year survival rate was 91% for 211 patients with stage I disease and 65% for 60 patients with stage II to IV dysgerminoma. The addition of contralateral adnexectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, and radiation therapy was not beneficial when disease was confined to one ovary. The survival of patients with advanced disease treated with chemotherapy was comparable with that of patients who received radiation. Analysis of the present data suggests that the use of unilateral oophorectomy should be limited to those patients with disease confined to one ovary and no histologic evidence of lymph node metastasis. Abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and adjuvant radiation is currently the treatment of choice for patients with more advanced dysgerminoma.\r"

  ".W": "We first performed a vaginosonic scan and then determined the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) concentration (Second International Standard) in 52 women at an early gestational age to establish criteria for the earliest possible identification of an intrauterine pregnancy by this new ultrasound technique. The smallest diameter of a gestational sac detected was 2 mm, and the lowest beta-hCG concentration was 141 mIU/ml when an intrauterine pregnancy was correctly diagnosed. Between 50 and 280 mIU/ml, six out of eight pregnancies in this range were not seen. However, all pregnancies associated with beta-hCG concentrations greater than 300 mIU/ml were correctly identified. Taking into account the rapid growth of the conceptus and the exponential increase of serum beta-hCG by a factor of 1.7 per day at this early gestational age, we presume that a gestational sac at beta-hCG concentrations of 750 mIU/ml should not be missed by vaginosonography (safety margin of the discriminatory zone), even in instances of a retroverted uterus. No false-positive vaginosonographic findings were observed in this study. A vaginosonographic examination is a short and well-tolerated procedure that can be performed in a physician's office. The use of a 5 MHz transducer placed in the vagina provides better resolution and image quality. This overcomes imperfect anatomy and other physical factors that interfere with good imaging. The vaginosonographic examination provides information on the anatomic location of the gestational sac, with the highest reliability and accuracy around the time a woman misses her menstrual period. It can be very useful in the differential diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Ring preparations of the vessels were prepared and mounted in organ baths, and isometric circular tension was recorded. Norepinephrine, 3 X 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L, produced concentration-dependent contractions, whereas 3 X 10(-7) to 10(-6) mol/L prostaglandin F2 alpha inconsistently produced weak contractions and slightly increased tension induced by 10(-5) mol/L norepinephrine. Prostaglandin I2, 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L, prostaglandin E2, 3 X 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, 10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L, and substance P, 10(-12) to 10(-9) mol/L, induced relaxation of vessels precontracted by 10(-5) mol/L norepinephrine. It is suggested that several mechanisms for the local release of vasoactive compounds may influence cervical blood flow. Thus, sympathetic control of cervical blood flow may be modulated by peptide neurotransmitters such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and substance P and by local synthesis of prostaglandins E2 and I2.\r"

Recent studies of Wilms' tumor, a childhood kidney neoplasm, have detected increased expression of IGF-2 mRNA and protein. The present report describes detection of Type 1 IGF receptors in specimens of Wilms' tumor and adjacent nonneoplastic kidney tissue. These receptors recognize both IGF-1 and IGF-2, and binding of either peptide activates endogenous tyrosine kinase activity of the Type 1 IGF receptor beta subunit. These data indicate that Wilms' tumors contain receptors that recognize and respond to exogenous IGF in vitro, and that autocrine IGF production might contribute to the increased proliferation and abnormal differentiation of these cells in vivo.\r"

If, as has been suggested, the pathogenesis of wound healing and tumor stroma generation is similar and dependent on fibrin deposition, then the types and amounts of fibrin deposited in wounds and tumors might also be expected to be similar. To test this hypothesis, the authors injected homologous tracer fibrinogen (125I-GPF) intravenously into guinea pigs and measured its influx and accumulation in skin wounds and syngeneic carcinomas. In support of their hypothesis, the urea-insoluble product deposited in both wounds and tumors was identified as cross-linked fibrin by gel electrophoresis. Accumulation of both total and urea-insoluble 125I-GPF was quantitatively similar in wounds and tumors. However, influx and initial clotting of 125I-GPF in tumors exceeded that in wounds; given equivalent accumulation, these data suggest that fibrin turnover is more rapid in tumors than in wounds. Fibrinogen influx and fibrin accumulation declined toward normal a few days after wounding but remained consistently elevated in tumors. Thus, the magnitude and the persistence of microvascular hyperpermeability, as well as fibrin turnover, are major points of difference that distinguish tumors from healing wounds.\r"

Their reactivities with basement membranes of normal and cystic segments of the renal tubules were ascertained by indirect immunofluorescence. The tissues were obtained either from kidneys of patients with adult (autosomal dominant) polycystic disease or from rats with renal cystic change induced by administration of 2-amino-4,5-diphenylthiazole HCl. The human and rat tissues that had undergone cystic change exhibited essentially similar results. A loss of reactivity to anti-heparan sulfate proteoglycan antibodies was observed. The reactivity toward anti-Type IV collagen and laminin either remained unchanged or was focally increased. The reactivity toward fibronectin, normally absent, increased dramatically in the peritubular regions and interstitium. The results indicate that there is an imbalance in various antigenic components associated with renal tubular cystic disease in rat and man, which may have a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

Immunocytochemical analysis of the cell line and SQ tumors revealed the high (NFP-H) and middle (NFP-M) molecular weight (Mr) neurofilament proteins (NFPs). Immunoblots demonstrated the presence of molecular species that co-migrated with authentic human NFP-H and NFP-M.

Several proinflammatory activities have been attributed to these cytokines, but their importance in anatomically compartmentalized inflammatory processes is unclear. The current in vitro studies have been designed to examine modulatory influences of these cytokines on O2-. responses of rat phagocytes implicated as effector cells in immune complex mediated lung injury. Purified human IL-1, recombinant human TNF (rTNF), and culture supernatant from zymosan-activated alveolar macrophages significantly amplified O2-. responses of immune complex-stimulated alveolar macrophages but did not enhance the responses of neutrophils. Equivalent concentrations of IL-1, rTNF, and alveolar macrophage culture supernatant had no direct stimulatory effect on alveolar macrophages as measured by O2-. production. Culture media from unstimulated alveolar macrophages exerted negligible effects on O2-. generation by immune complex-activated alveolar macrophages. These data indicate that O2- responses of immune complex alveolar macrophages can be enhanced by the presence of IL-1, TNF, or media from activated macrophages. It is possible that macrophage products may greatly amplify tissue injury through the enhancement of oxygen radical production.\r"

  ".U": "88161292\r", 
  ".W": "In man, lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules (HEVs) involves specific 85-95 kd cell surface glycoprotein(s) recognized by the monoclonal antibodies Hermes-1 and Hermes-3. These putative \"homing receptor\" molecule(s) are believed to play an important role in the normal regulation of lymphocyte circulation. To investigate the possibility that homing receptors also play a role in the biology of lymphoid malignancies, the authors studied over 300 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by immunohistologic staining with Hermes-1 and -3, antibodies that define two distinct epitopes on the gp 85-95 putative homing receptor molecules. Furthermore, they directly compared expression of the Hermes-3 antigen with clinical extent of disease in 57 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma. They found that staining of the various subtypes of lymphoma was heterogeneous, and in general correlated with patterns of expression seen in benign lymphoid populations. Essentially all normal lymphoid populations examined, except germinal center B cells and most cortical thymocytes, bear a high level of homing receptor antigen. Similarly, nearly all peripheral T-cell lymphomas, diffuse small cell lymphomas of B lineage, and plasma cell tumors were positive for homing receptor antigen (95%, 97%, and 100%, respectively). Small noncleaved cell, follicular, and diffuse large cell lymphomas of B lineage, tumors having morphologic or immunologic features resembling germinal center cells, frequently failed to express Hermes-defined epitopes (81%, 41%, 25% Hermes-3-, respectively). Antigen expression in T-lymphoblastic lymphomas strongly correlated with immunophenotypic subtypes: only 8% of CD4+/CD8+ were Hermes-1+ versus 86% of CD4-/CD8- and 43% of CD4+/CD8-. Hermes-3 expression by cases of diffuse, large cell lymphoma which showed generalized lymph node involvement (a pattern strongly suggestive of HEV-mediated spread; 100% Hermes-3+, mean intensity 3.4) was higher than that of cases with localized or multifocal, contiguous involvement (consistent with lymphatic spread; 69% Hermes-3+, mean intensity 2.2), but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. The results indicate that homing receptor antigen expression, although perhaps necessary for wide-spread blood-borne lymphoma dissemination to lymphoid sites, is not in and of itself sufficient to predict such behavior in this subtype of lymphoid malignancy.\r"

By light microscopy, the authors diagnosed 1 botrioid, 1 alveolar, and 7 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, 4 pleomorphic spindle cell sarcomas, and 2 spindle cell sarcomas, one nondistinct, the other with a hemangiopericytomatous pattern. By transmission electron microscopy, 13 neoplasms disclosed rhabdomyoblastic differentiation; the remaining 2, myogenic differentiation. By immunofluorescence microscopy, all neoplasms expressed vimentin and alpha-sr actin, 12 expressed, in addition, desmin, and 1 expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin. Among the 11 neoplasms studied by means of 2D-GE, 7 demonstrated an alpha-actin spot, while 4 showed only beta and gamma spots. One tumor disclosed, in addition to alpha, beta, and gamma spots, a spot with a molecular weight corresponding to actin, but more acidic than alpha-actins. This study demonstrates that alpha-sr actin antibody represents a valuable marker for the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma, because it was present in all neoplasms, including the one negative for desmin. This antibody further allowed the recognition of pleomorphic variants and morphologically atypical forms of rhabdomyosarcomas. The presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin in 1 case of rhabdomyosarcoma suggests that this actin isoform may be expressed during skeletal muscle differentiation.\r"

Immunoreactive renin was found in 23 (82%) cases. Specific staining was always associated with small vessels in the stroma of the tumor or in adjacent areas of inflamed fibrous tissue. Within vessels, renin was localized in the cytoplasm of medial cells. Adenocarcinoma exhibited the most consistent staining (11/12 cases), and this appeared to be independent of the degree of tumor differentiation. Immunoreactive renin was also detected in squamous cell (7/8 cases), undifferentiated large cell (4/4 cases), and small cell undifferentiated carcinoma (1/1 cases), but the number of vessels and intensity of staining were usually less than seen in adenocarcinoma. Staining was not found in the bronchioloalveolar variant of adenocarcinoma (0/3 cases). By means of immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised to kidney renin, both active and inactive renin were extracted from homogenates of surgical specimens. The molecular weight of both forms of renin was approximately 59,000 daltons.\r"

The role of breast-feeding and weaning has received remarkably little attention both in the more biologically oriented studies and in epidemiologic work. This paper reviews endocrinologic data which support the thesis that postpartum psychiatric disorders have a hormonal basis and discusses the possible psychiatric effects of breast-feeding and weaning. The cases of four patients who developed major depressions in close temporal association with weaning are presented and discussed.\r"

Although the primary epidemiology of the disease has been described, much work remains to be done to complete our understanding of the dynamics of transmission and infection with the causative virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). At the state and local level, the highest priorities for epidemiologic research are to understand better the precise populations at risk of prevalent and incident HIV infection, and to use this information to direct and monitor specific prevention programs that are likely to be effective for the populations at risk. These parallel efforts-sophisticated investigative epidemiologic research and applied epidemiologic and serosurveillance studies-must be expanded rapidly and continued for the forseeable future if we are to accomplish the goal of preventing further spread of HIV.\r"

These studies demonstrate rapid, profound, but expectably incomplete alterations in the behavior of both homosexual/bisexual males and intravenous drug users. This is true in the highest risk metropolitan areas such as New York City and in areas with lower AIDS incidence. Risk reduction is occurring more frequently through the modification of sexual or drug-use behavior than through its elimination. In contrast to aggregate data, longitudinal descriptions of individual behavior demonstrate considerable instability or recidivism. Behavioral change in the potentially vulnerable heterosexual adolescent and young adult populations is less common, as is risk reduction among urban minorities. Reports of AIDS-related knowledge and attitudes generally parallel the pattern of behavioral changes. Nonetheless, few studies investigate the relationship of knowledge and attitudes to risk reduction. Future studies should provide much-needed information about the determinants as well as the magnitude of behavioral changes required to reduce the further spread of AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "88161550\r", 
  ".W": "With increasing competition for resources, health departments are faced with the question of whether to target female prostitutes as a high priority component of AIDS prevention strategy. Prostitutes are considered to be a reservoir for transmission of certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, a variety of studies suggest that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in prostitutes follows a different pattern than that for STDs: HIV infection in non-drug using prostitutes tends to be low or absent, implying that sexual activity alone does not place them at high risk, while prostitutes who use intravenous drugs are far more likely to be infected with HIV. Emerging data from heterosexual groups similarly suggest a low rate of heterosexual transmission, particularly from women to men. Prostitutes who do not use intravenous drugs probably face their highest risk from steady partners who may be infected with HIV and other STDs and with whom barrier protection is generally not used. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for health departments to place high priority on prevention efforts directed to prostitutes: 1) prostitutes often have other risky behaviors such as drug use; and 2) prostitutes are reachable, being a group which is already in the health care system administered by health departments.\r"

The state Medicaid programs were surveyed by mail for this research in mid 1987 to determine if the states covered AZT (Retrovir), if limits apply to this coverage, if the states have or are developing AIDS-related policies, and if hospice care is a benefit. Forty-four states cover AZT (two additional states cover AZT only during inpatient hospital care), with most Medicaid programs placing some limit on coverage or reimbursement. Most states do not have special Medicaid coverage for AIDS care nor are they developing proposals or policies for this care. However, a number of states are developing or implementing AIDS-related policies through their Medicaid programs. These policies can become models for other Medicaid programs to follow if the incidence of AIDS increases in their states.\r"

Of these, 29% (N = 555) were admitted to the emergency room for injuries, with drinkers more likely than abstainers to be admitted for injuries. Differences were found in the quantity and frequency of usual drinking and frequency of drunkenness for type and cause of injury and for prior alcohol-related accidents. Little differences was found between the injured and noninjured on social consequences of drinking or experiences associated with alcohol dependence and loss of control over drinking. Both injured and noninjured in this population reported much higher rates of frequent heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems than that found in the general population which may have masked additional associations of drinking patterns and problems with injury status.\r"

  ".U": "88161585\r", 
  ".W": "It is a well-known phenomenon that serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP, EC 2.3.2.2.) activity is increased after chronic consumption of ethanol, and gamma-GTP has been, therefore, widely used as a sensitive marker for detection of alcoholism and its related liver disease. However, the precise mechanisms whereby the chronic ethanol consumption leads to an increase in serum gamma-GTP activity are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the intestinal and serum gamma-GTP activities after chronic ethanol consumption both in rats and humans. Chronic ethanol feeding to rats resulted in a significant increase in serum gamma-GTP activity associated with a significant increment of the intestinal gamma-GTP activity. The histochemical staining of gamma-GTP in the mucosa of the small intestine of these animals demonstrated enhanced gamma-GTP activity at the microvilli of the brush border membrane, lamina propria of the mucosa, and endoplasmic reticulum of the intestinal epithelial cell. The augmented activity in the lamina propria was mainly localized at the submucosal lymphatics. Histology of the small intestine of human alcoholics was, more or less, similar to those observed in alcoholic rats. We further investigated the gamma-GTP activity in the mesenteric lymph using the animal model of lymphorrhea, and found that the gamma-GTP activity was increased by 83% when expressed per unit of lymph in the ethanol-fed rat, accompanied by a marked decrease of serum gamma-GTP activity, suggesting a close relationship between the serum and the intestinal gamma-GTP via the lymphatic channel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Metabolites were measured and the redox state and phosphorylation potential were calculated. Epidermal growth factor alone elevated hepatic content of glucose 1-P, glucose 6-P, fructose 6-P, and 3-phosphoglycerate 1.2-1.3-fold when compared to saline treatment. Ethanol alone decreased hepatic content of 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate 3.2-3.7-fold below saline-treated levels. Ethanol, in combination with EGF, decreased hepatic values for 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate 2.0-2.3-fold from saline treatment but elevated the content of phosphoenolpyruvate 1.6-fold over ethanol treatment alone. Epidermal growth factor inhibited pyruvate kinase activity 1.3-fold when compared to saline controls but ethanol in the presence of EGF facilitated the recovery of activity of this enzyme.\r"

Consistent with \"Fitts' Law\" (Fitts PM: J Exp Psych 47:381-391, 1954), a highly linear relationship between movement time and task difficulty was observed in all four groups. Overall, the alcoholics were slower and made more errors than the controls, although the pattern of deficit differed for males and females. Accuracy, but not speed, was impaired in male alcoholics. The production of undershoot errors was increased more in alcoholics than nonalcoholics in targets of narrower width, whereas the production of overshoot errors was increased more in alcoholics as target separation decreased. Female alcoholics displayed impairment in speed of movement, but not accuracy. However, both alcoholic groups displayed elevated error rates for the more difficult targets. It is thus possible that detoxified alcoholics might mimic the speed functions of nonalcoholic individuals at the occasional cost of an erroneous response at a difficult target.\r"

Several lines of research have suggested that ethanol-induced changes in the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase cascade may be involved in this process. Using an embryonic chick model, it was demonstrated that ethanol exposure during early development caused increases in cellular prostaglandin E2 and cyclic AMP levels that were inversely correlated with brain weight. Paradoxically, basal adenylate cyclase and protein kinase catalytic activities, assayed in vitro, were not altered by ethanol dosing. Ethanol exposure did suppress the responsiveness of brain adenylate cyclase to exogenous PGE2. Furthermore, ethanol treatment significantly lowered the brain cytoplasmic levels of cyclic AMP binding protein.\r"

Liquid Bio-Serv diets were used. Alcohol feeding began on day 5 of pregnancy and ended on day 10 postpartum. The weight gain of the pups after birth was drastically reduced compared with pair-fed and other control groups; however, removal of the alcohol on day 10 postpartum resulted in an upswing of the growth curve that paralleled control groups. Between days 2 and 21 (postnatal) three behavioral tests of motor function were performed. Righting reflex (time for an animal to return to all four feet after being placed on its dorsum) was slightly delayed but the delay was not significant. Negative geotaxis (time for an animal to rotate 180 degrees from a head-down position on an inclined plane), and reflex suspension (time an animal maintained its grip on a crossbar) were significantly delayed (approximately 2 days) in offspring from alcohol-fed mothers. In the frontal cortex the offspring of alcohol-treated mothers, a marked decrease (approximately 25%) in thickness of Lamina VI was found while the other Lamina (I-V) were less altered. These results indicate that the effect of alcohol on the frontal cortex is related to a significant delay in motor development of reflex suspension and negative geotaxis since both of these require frontal integration.\r"

The testis enzyme had similar antigenicity than the liver enzyme as demonstrated by double immunodiffusion and inhibition titration using antibody to the liver enzyme. The concentration of immunoreactive enzyme protein was 1.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/mg of cytosol protein in the testis as compared with 9.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/mg of cytosol protein in the liver. Isoelectric focusing revealed eight isoenzyme bands. Only the three bands with the highest isoelectric points precipitated with antibody to liver alcohol dehydrogenase. By immunohistochemistry using this antibody, the enzyme was localized principally to the Leydig cells which are also the site of steroidogenesis. The presence in the seminiferous tubules of isoenzymes of lower isoelectric point, which do not react with the antibody to the liver enzyme, can not be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Male squirrel monkeys were fed increasing caloric percentages (0, 12, 24, and 36%) of ethanol (ETOH) substituted isocalorically for carbohydrate as part of a chemically defined liquid diet to assess how alcohol dose modifies plasma lipoproteins and liver function. A separate group of primates was used to define the dose at which elevations in plasma apolipoprotein B first occurred and to measure plasma alcohol levels. ETOH caused a dose-related, linear increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol which was primarily the result of increments in coronary protective HDL2 cholesterol. HDL2 total mass (lipid + protein) followed the pattern of HDL2 cholesterol. Animals fed the 12% regimen had plasma ETOH levels of approximately 49 mg/dl, the lowest low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and the highest HDL2/HDL3 cholesterol ratio. Significant elevations in apolipoprotein B first appeared at 18% ETOH while higher doses (24 and 36%) caused increases in LDL cholesterol and HDL3, reduced HDL2/HDL3 ratios, and plasma alcohol levels of 142 and 202 mg/dl, respectively. Liver function tests were normal for all animals. Our results indicate that while a moderate ETOH caloric intake (12%) produces an antiatherogenic lipoprotein profile (decreases LDL/HDL, increases HDL2/HDL3), any coronary protection afforded by continued increases in HDL2 at higher doses may be attenuated by concurrent atherogenic alterations (increases LDL cholesterol, increases apolipoprotein B).\r"

The proliferative response in all patient groups was significantly lower when compared to healthy controls and was independent of the presence or absence of liver disease.

The treated group received ethanol administered as 38% of caloric intake in a liquid diet (Sustacal) for 10 months. The control rats were pair weighted to the ethanol-treated animals throughout the study; the growth curves of the two groups were the same. The controls were given the same liquid diet except that dextrin:maltose (3:1) was substituted isocalorically for ethanol. Ethanol-treated rats did not differ from the pair-weighted controls in mean serum calcium, phosphorous, or creatinine. In contrast, serum magnesium was reduced (p less than 0.02) in alcohol-treated rats. Ethanol treatment also resulted in changes in the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites; serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was increased (p less than 0.001), while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was decreased (p less than 0.01). Tibial length was reduced in ethanol-treated rats (p less than 0.05) but there was no change in femoral length. Medullary area was increased in tibial diaphyses from alcohol-treated rats compared to weight matched control animals (p less than 0.01), indicating a net increase in resorption. The cross-sectional area of the tibial diaphysis of ethanol-treated rats was the same as the matched controls. Trabecular bone was decreased in the tibial metaphysis of ethanol-treated rats compared to the matched controls (p less than 0.05) indicating a net loss of trabecular bone. Ethanol treatment did not have an effect on the organic weight of the femur but the ash weight was reduced (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five alcoholics were studied twice, once shortly after admission to an inpatient unit and the second time 1 month later. On each study day patients were given a tryptophan load of 50 mg/kg. Kynurenine in the urines (which reflects tryptophan oxygenase activity) was measured for a period of 6 hr following the load and showed a significantly enhanced activity of the enzyme shortly after cessation of drinking. This increased activity could explain the lowered tryptophan levels we have previously reported in alcoholics. The increase in enzyme activity may have been mediated by a rise in glucocorticoid hormones. In all instances, plasma cortisol measured hourly for 6 hr after the start of the experiment, was higher shortly after cessation of drinking than 1 month later.\r"

Two pathologists independently analyzed each biopsy and completed a questionnaire including 41 items. Coefficient of concordance between observers was evaluated with the kappa statistic (k). The prevalence of 14 lesions was low, equal to or under 10%, leading to a nonsignificant concordance. For the 27 remaining features, two had an almost perfect degree of concordance (k greater than 0.81): presence of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Three had a substantial coefficient of concordance (k greater than 0.61): fibrous septa, size of cirrhotic nodules, and liver cell regeneration. Nine had a moderate (k greater than 0.41), 11 a fair (k greater than 0.21), and two a slight (k less than 0.21) coefficient of concordance. In terms of final diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease the concordance was substantial for cirrhosis with acute alcoholic hepatitis (k = 0.77), cirrhosis without alcoholic hepatitis (k = 0.75), acute alcoholic hepatitis without cirrhosis (k = 0.65) and normal liver (k = 0.64).

Following treatment with a liquid diet for 7 days, resting Cai and KCl-stimulated increases in Cai were measured in synaptosomes isolated from chronic ethanol-treated and pair-fed animals. Ethanol (350-700 mM) increased resting Cai and reduced KCl-stimulated increases in Cai in synaptosomes isolated from pair-fed animals. Ethanol-induced changes in Cai were reduced in synaptosomes isolated from chronic ethanol-treated animals. The effect of ethanol on synaptosomal Cai in long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differential sensitivity to the hypnotic actions of acute ethanol, was also investigated. In the absence of ethanol, resting values of Cai and KCl-stimulated increases in Cai did not differ between the two lines of mice. Ethanol (200-600 mM) increased resting Cai and reduced depolarization-stimulated increases in Cai in both long-sleep and short-sleep mice to the same degree. Similarly, KCl-stimulated increases in Ca uptake did not differ in synaptosomes isolated from whole brains and cortices of LS and SS mice, in the absence of presence of ethanol. These findings demonstrate that tolerance develops to the effect of ethanol on neuronal Cai following chronic treatment. However, sensitivity to the hypnotic action of ethanol is not related to changes in neuronal Cai in LS and SS mice.\r"

All the alcoholics were first admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital, Lund, during the years 1949 to 1969 and followed up until January 1, 1981. They were systematically rated concerning symptoms and etiological factors at first admission. According to a stepwise logistic regression analysis, the following initial symptoms were positively associated with later compulsory treatment: slight cerebral dysfunction/personality change, antisociality/criminality, and impaired social and work performance. Social pressure/responsibility/conflict, slight depression, and continuous drinking were positively associated with the controls. There were 168 deaths in the compulsory treatment group and 124 in the control group (p less than 0.01). The excess deaths in the compulsory treatment group were mainly caused by accidents, poisoning, and violence (21 cases) and sudden cardiac death (10 cases), while there were no differences concerning alcohol-related neoplasms and liver cirrhosis. The compulsory treatment group had a worse long-term social adjustment. The findings indicate that compulsory treatment was related to behavioral patterns showing a stability over time, supporting the validity of subclassification of alcoholics using social data.\r"

Alcoholics and social drinkers generally did not differ in their physiological responses to alcohol doses and placebo, while some evidence for tolerance to reported euphoric effects of alcohol in the alcoholic subjects was found. The possibility is raised that early physiological responses observed during ethanol ingestion may arise not only from pharmacological effects of the drink, but may also be evidence for conditional predrink responses.\r"

Three week-old male mice (12-16 g) were placed on liquid diet (5% ethanol) while a weight-matched littermate control was fed isocaloric maltose-dextrin in place of ethanol. Animals were sacrificed after 3 weeks and the liver and stomach were excised for biochemical analysis. Although the ethanol feeding did not influence the stomach ADH and ALDH activity levels, these enzymes in the liver were affected. The liver ADH activity was depressed to varying degrees in all mouse genotypes studied. Also, the ethanol feeding altered the liver-ALDH activity, which was highly variable and genotype specific. The mice of C57BL/6J and F1 C57BL/6JxBALB/c, both relatively resistant genotypes, exhibited significant increase in liver ALDH-(cytosolic and whole liver homogenate) activity. The response in the other genotypes were not significantly different from their matched controls. The relative resistance of the C57BL/6J strain may be associated with the increase in liver ALDH activity which is expected to facilitate the elimination of acetaldehyde, the toxic metabolite. The results from the selected F1 crosses indicate a multigene system regulating the inducibility of the liver ALDH. The relative sensitivity of different genotypes may be attributed to inducibility components regulating the liver enzyme activity, particularly liver ALDH following challenges with ethanol. These observations may offer a new approach in explaining extensive variability in response to alcohols in most populations.\r"

Sodium acetate, or sodium chloride in control experiments, was infused i.v. at the rate of 0.033 mEq/kg/min for 60 min. Left ventricular function was examined by M-mode echocardiography and systolic time intervals during infusion and for 60 min thereafter. Blood acetate rose during infusion from 0.19 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SEM) to a maximum of 0.99 +/- 0.08 mmol/liter. Changes in serum free fatty acids, glycerol, and ketone bodies indicate that acetate inhibited peripheral lipolysis. The volume of urine excreted during the acetate experiment (305 +/- 37 ml) was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) than during the chloride experiment (181 +/- 21 ml). Left ventricular function did not differ between the experiments during the infusions even though at 45 min heart rate was increased by acetate (7%; p less than 0.01, between infusions). After the infusion period, at 75 min the treatment by acetate increased cardiac output from the baseline by 17% (p less than 0.05, between infusions), and decreased peripheral arterial resistance (19%, p less than 0.05), and diastolic blood pressure (10%, p less than 0.01). Circumferential fiber shortening velocity was increased during the acetate experiment maximally by 7% (p less than 0.01) from the baseline at 120 min. These data indicate that acetate is an arterial vasodilator and a mild diuretic and may slightly improve myocardial performance in the concentrations encountered during ethanol metabolism in men.\r"

  ".W": "Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce a variety of behavioral and physiological alterations, including changes in sexually dimorphic behaviors. It has been proposed that alcohol alters these behaviors by altering prenatal androgen and/or other steroid levels. This study was designed to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on a sexually dimorphic neuroanatomical structure, namely, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (SDN-POA). This nucleus is larger in males than females and is sensitive to perinatal sex steroid exposure. The SDN-POA was examined in 70-80-day-old male and female rats whose mothers received on days 6-20 of pregnancy either a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) or a 0% EDC isocaloric pair-fed liquid diet. An ad libitum lab chow control group was also included (LC). Both volume and average cell size of the SDN-POA were markedly smaller in alcohol-exposed males relative to 0% EDC and LC controls. In contrast, prenatal alcohol exposure did not appear to affect SDN-POA volume or cell size in females. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not significantly alter the volume of a nearby nucleus, the nucleus of the anterior commissure, in either sex. These findings support the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure alters sexual differentiation in males, perhaps by altering some aspect of the prenatal androgen environment. The absence of any effect in 35% EDC females suggests that males and females may be differentially sensitive to alcohol's effects on this nucleus.\r"

Although alcohol sensitizing drugs and more recently serotonin uptake inhibitors are drug interventions with some following, their long term beneficial consequences have yet to be demonstrated. In recent years, we have demonstrated that manipulating activity in the renin-angiotensin system will dramatically alter voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. Based on these findings, the present study evaluated the ability of a class of drugs known as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to reduce voluntary alcohol drinking in laboratory animals. These drugs prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They have been licensed for use in Europe and North America and are indicated in the treatment of hypertension. Our experiments showed that both captopril (Capoten, Squibb) and enalapril (Vasotec, Merck Sharpe & Dohme) can reduce alcohol drinking in both normotensive and hypertensive animals regardless of whether the pattern of intake is in a bout or of a less exaggerated nature. Furthermore, this change in alcohol intake can occur without concomitant changes in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, overall fluid balance, or the distribution and metabolism of alcohol. Taken together these findings suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be evaluated in a clinical setting for they may prove to be a useful new treatment or treatment adjunct for alcohol abuse in humans.\r"

Furthermore, there appears to be a critical iron concentration necessary for the induction of hepatic fibrosis. Lipid peroxidation induced by ethanol and/or iron would appear to play a major role in hepatic damage in both humans and experimental animals. Although the exact mechanism(s) of induction of lipid peroxidation by ethanol and iron remains to be elucidated, both toxins can exert a synergistic effect upon hepatic lipid peroxidation. Iron overload has also been shown to stimulate directly hepatocyte and hepatic procollagen mRNA expression, which is further stimulated by ethanol. The observed synergism between iron and alcohol with respect to both hepatic lipid peroxidation and collagen biosynthesis offers a possible explanation of the apparent early onset of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with iron overload who have an excessive alcohol intake.\r"

Ethanol treatment as compared to that of isocaloric sucrose decreased maternal weight, and decreased both the litter size and the number of liveborn offspring. Total litter weight was significantly decreased with the low ethanol dose (12% alcohol-derived energy). During pregnancy, low and high doses produced peak blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) of 89 +/- 8 mg/dl (mean +/- SE) and 125 +/- 6 mg/dl, respectively. At the high dose, peak BEC decreased dramatically (about 30%) in both pregnant and nonpregnant animals from treatment weeks 0 to 4; thereafter peak BEC remained depressed up to 8 weeks of treatment, which occurred with a concomitant increased volume of ethanol distribution. With both doses, rates of ethanol elimination and Michaelis-Menten's Vm values were significantly lower among pregnant as compared with nonpregnant guinea pigs during 8 weeks of treatment. These data suggest that the guinea pigs can be a valuable animal model to study the effects of low ethanol doses on fetal growth, the adaptation of peak BEC with duration of treatment and the lower rate of ethanol elimination in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor is coupled with a GABA-receptor chloride-ionophore complex. The BZs augment the GABA-induced increase in chloride conductance, which leads to postsynaptic inhibition. This effect is believed to be responsible for antianxiety, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects, but the mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects are poorly understood. Various other sedative-hypnotics, including ethanol and barbiturates, interact with this system, probably contributing to their behavioral effects. We have recently conducted a selective breeding program to develop lines of mice which are diazepam-resistant (DR) and sensitive (DS) (Gallaher EJ, Hollister LE, Gionet SE, Crabbe JC. Psychopharmacology, 93:25-30, 1987); when tested for the duration of rotarod impairment after 20 mg/kg diazepam the DR line was impaired for 71 +/- 13 min compared with 200 +/- 18 min in the DS line. In the current study we tested mice from the DR and DS lines to determine if BZ sensitivity generalized to ethanol. DS mice became ataxic with lower brain ethanol concentrations, and recovered at later times and with lower blood ethanol concentrations, than did DR mice, indicating that sensitivity differences did extend to ethanol. Following a series of sequential doses over 5 to 6 hr DS mice developed minimal rapid tolerance, whereas DR mice developed considerable tolerance. By the end of the day DS mice were therefore much more sensitive to ethanol than were DR mice; this difference was greater in males than in females. High dose ethanol toxicity was studied by assaying brain ethanol concentrations at the cessation of respiration; no differences were found between lines or sexes.\r"

  ".W": "A computerized tomographic (CT) brain scan and assessments of lifetime alcohol consumption, body size, and cognitive performance were performed in 37 male alcoholics, aged 26-62 years. Hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were also measured. CT data were analyzed using a semiautomated scoring system yielding measures of percentage of fluid at the ventricles and cortical sulci. Normative brain CT data from 57 community controls spanning the adult age range allowed Z-score assessment of deviation from age norms for each alcoholic. Across the entire group, alcoholics had significantly enlarged ventricles and sulci for their age. Enlargement at both sites correlated significantly with lifetime alcohol consumption. Sulcal enlargement in alcoholics was found across all ages. In contrast, ventricular enlargement was apparent only in older alcoholics and became increasingly exaggerated with age. Measures of body size, hematocrit, and MCV correlated with ventricular but not sulcal enlargement, suggesting that nutritional factors play a role in ventricular enlargement. Associations between neuropsychological performance and CT changes or alcohol consumption were less pronounced and at times counterintuitive. The findings support a modest dose-effect relationship between ethanol exposure and changes in brain morphology, and suggest that ventricles and sulci show a different time course of response. The role of nutritional status needs to be more closely investigated.\r"

In addition PI responses in young adult (8 months old) and old (22 months old) rats were compared to investigate the possible interaction between chronic ethanol treatment and aging on stimulated inositide metabolism. Fischer 344 rats were maintained on a nutritionally complete liquid diet containing sucrose or ethanol for 5 months. PI hydrolysis in prelabeled cortical or cerebellar slices was determined by measuring the release of [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence of 8 mM LiCl. Neither chronic ethanol nor aging altered maximal PI responses to carbachol or submaximal responses elicited by 20 mM KCl or 30 microM A23187. The glutamate-induced response was slightly reduced in the aged rats. Concentration-effect curves for norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated PI hydrolysis were similar in sucrose- and ethanol-treated cortex and cerebellum. Ethanol in vitro inhibited NE-stimulated PI hydrolysis in cortical but not cerebellar slices. The ethanol-induced inhibition of the NE-stimulated PI response was not altered by aging or chronic ethanol treatment. These results suggest that aging or chronic ethanol treatment do not cause large changes in the responsiveness of most PI-linked receptors, and thus, any deficits caused by these conditions may not be due to functional changes in receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis.\r"

Five hundred and fifty-five offspring were given a liquid diet containing ethanol as their sole food source for 9 days in an attempt to induce dependence. At 6 hr postwithdrawal on day 10, the mice were given a battery of physiological and behavioral measures designed to assess the symptoms of withdrawal. Littermate data were aggregated separately by sex and the aggregate litter mean data was employed in a multivariate extension of Hayman's diallel analysis. Hypothesis sums of squares and cross-products were tested against pooled-within-cell sums of squares and cross-products using Wilk's lambda as a criterion. For each sex, a highly significant additive effect was found, with some evidence for dominance effects as well, suggesting the raw materials are present for successful genetic selection. There was some evidence for dominance effects as well, but no evidence for maternal and other reciprocal effects was found for the set of seven measures. Composites derived from the additive and general dominance hypotheses correlation matrices and error correlation matrix were compared with a composite index currently being used in a multivariate selection study of ethanol dependence. Total ethanol consumption during the exposure period was positively correlated with low dependence between strains, and negatively correlated with measures of low dependence within cells.\r"

Pulmonary artery disruption from blunt trauma is extremely rare. Two patients both women, older and obese with multiple rib fractures and little pulmonary parenchymal damage are reported. Neither had injury to the aorta, heart or intra-abdominal organs. One patient survived after lateral repair of the left main pulmonary artery and the other exsanguinated from a laceration of the right main pulmonary artery. Intrapericardial exposure of the proximal pulmonary arteries may be necessary for control of hemorrhage. Trauma surgeons should be familiar with this technique. Indications for immediate thoracotomy should include: massive hemothorax (greater than 1000 ml), continued bleeding greater than 300 ml in the first hour, bleeding greater than 200 ml/hr for 5 hours, or increasing hemothorax in spite of tube thoracostomy. Close adherence to these guidelines would have allowed both patients to be explored earlier.\r"

  ".W": "This study consisted of 52 patients admitted for orthopedic surgery and 28 patients admitted for general surgery, who were treated with Sequential Compression Devices (SCD) and Thromboembolic Deterrent Stockings (TEDS) and monitored for the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Coagulation and fibrinolytic profiles were carried out on these patients preoperatively, and on days one, three, and six postoperatively. All patients were followed by I-125-Fibrinogen scanning, Venous Doppler, and Impedance Plethysmography studies for clot detection. In the orthopedic surgery group, six (11.5%) developed DVT, and in the general surgery group, one (3.6%) developed DVT. No patients developed pulmonary embolism. The combined incidence of DVT was 8.8 per cent. A variety of parameters was measured in order to determine whether compression devices prevent a fibrinolytic shut-down commonly seen in the postsurgical patient. A combination of three assays was found to be significant in demonstrating a fibrinolytic response. These parameters were a post-surgical decrease in the plasminogen level, an increase in the level of free protease activity postoperatively, and an increase in the level of tissue plasminogen activator after surgery. 56.3 per cent of all patients treated with SCD and TEDS showed a fibrinolytic response on postoperative day one by a combination of all three of these parameters. In the group of patients that developed DVT none showed an increase in free protease activity, and five of seven showed no significant decrease in plasminogen and no increase in tissue plasminogen activator. Patients who developed thrombosis had measurable differences in their fibrinolytic system compared to those without postoperative thrombosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all cases, patients were febrile and leukopenic (granulocyte count, less than 500 cells/mm3), and were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics at onset of the skin rash. Erythematous macules and papules were distributed primarily over the chest, shoulders, and upper back, and pustules and crusts developed in some cases. Granulocyte counts of more than 500 cells/mm3 were associated with resolution of the rash. Pityrosporum infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skin rashes in marrow graft recipients.\r"

We evaluated 27 trials of bone marrow autotransplants in 172 patients who received single or multiple drug chemotherapy, radiation, or both. The overall response rate was 58%. Response rates were highest in trials involving multiple alkylating agents (76%) or previously untreated patients (81%). These data suggest that high-dose therapy and bone marrow autotransplants can produce remissions in patients with advanced breast cancer unresponsive to conventional therapy. A critical evaluation of this approach will require controlled trials in high-risk persons.\r"

Patients often have hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies, rashes, thrombocytopenia, or hemolytic anemia. Diagnosis requires a lymph node biopsy that shows architectural effacement, absence of germinal centers, arborization of postcapillary venules, and a polymorphous infiltrate that includes immunoblasts. Early in the disease, activated T cells in blood and lymph nodes stimulate B cells to proliferate and produce antibody. However, late in the disease, immune suppression may result from increased suppressor function. Clonal rearrangements, which are seen in all patients with regard to either the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene or immunoglobulin genes, have been followed by malignant transformation and frank lymphoma in some patients. Thus, this disorder stands partway between benign lymphoid proliferation and clonal lymphoid transformation. The prognosis of this disorder is poor; 75% of patients die within 2 years or develop a lymphoid malignancy. The rest usually go into a sustained remission. Current treatment with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive agents is unsatisfactory, especially because of late immunosuppression and predisposition to infections.\r"

Cytomegalovirus retinitis, colitis, esophagitis, and gastritis are the commonest manifestations of severe cytomegalovirus end-organ disease. Extensive trials with intravenous ganciclovir, a nucleoside analogue with myelosuppressive toxicity, have shown that ganciclovir halts the progression of cytomegalovirus retinitis and gastrointestinal disease. Since relapse is common when therapy is discontinued, most patients with AIDS need life-long maintenance therapy. The clinical response to ganciclovir therapy is usually accompanied by diminished shedding of the virus. Based on limited data, foscarnet, a pyrophosphate analogue, also appears to have some efficacy in treating cytomegalovirus infection. Unlike ganciclovir, foscarnet does not cause myelosuppression. An important direction for future clinical research is the development of more effective and less toxic therapy, as well as orally bioavailable drugs for maintenance therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A progressive encephalopathy occurs in 30 to 50% of infants and children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The expression of HIV antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid appears to correlate with the clinical occurrence of progressive encephalopathy. The signs of progressive encephalopathy in children with HIV infection, including loss of developmental milestones, impaired brain growth, and progressive motor dysfunction, indicate a poor prognosis and almost invariably a fatal outcome. Neuropathological findings in these children, including virus-laden macrophages and multinucleated giant cells are unique to this condition. Opportunistic or reactivated latent infections and neoplasms of brain occur in children with HIV infection but are uncommon. These findings support the hypothesis that the progressive encephalopathy observed in HIV-infected children is caused by primary infection of the brain with this virus. Epidemiological data predict increasing numbers of HIV-infected women and children. Research aimed at an understanding of the mechanism(s) of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV infection is urgently needed so that strategies for the prevention and treatment of such infection in children may be planned.\r"

  ".W": "A neurotropic retrovirus causes a naturally occurring lower-limb paralysis in wild mice, characterized by a noninflammatory spongiform change located primarily in the lower spinal cord. The causative agent is an ecotropic murine leukemia virus, unique to certain wild mice in southern California. The disease is readily transmitted to newborn susceptible laboratory mice. The paralytogenic property is attributed to direct viral injury to motor neurons and glial cells and is associated with unique amino acids in the murine leukemia virus envelope gp70. This murine model may have relevance to both human T-lymphotropic virus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus infection of human brain. It presents a practical model for testing antiviral agents aimed at retrovirus infection of the mammalian central nervous system. Simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome type D retrovirus causes a silent infection of the brain in infected macaques. Viral nucleic acids are detected in the brain parenchyma in the absence of viral antigen, neurological symptoms, and neuropathology. Infected choroid plexus epithelial cells are the source of cell-free virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of viremic monkeys. This model adds yet another example of retroviral infection of the central nervous system and points to the choroid plexus as a potential source of infectious virus.\r"

Although the exact incidence of clinical and subclinical neuromuscular diseases in HIV-positive and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients is unknown, estimates vary from 15 to almost 50% of such individuals. The type of neuropathy or myopathy related to the specific stage of HIV infection, the pathogenetic mechanisms involved, and effective therapies are discussed. A neuromuscular disease not only occurs in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex, but it can coincide with HIV seroconversion or it can be the only clinical indication of a chronic silent HIV infection. Chronic asymptomatic HIV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of certain acquired inflammatory polyneuropathies or myopathies. Precautions needed when doing electromyographic studies are discussed.\r"

HIV encephalitis initially is associated with myelin pallor and gliosis of the centrum semiovale, which is found in more than 90% of brains from patients dying with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. With increased severity of disease, multiple glial nodules with the multinucleated cells characteristic of HIV encephalitis are present throughout the cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex, and also may be found in cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. HIV has been demonstrated in monocytes and multinucleated cells by electron microscopy, immunohistochemical techniques, and in situ hybridization. Vacuolar myelopathy occurs in approximately 30% of patients and is characterized by vacuolation of the white matter of the spinal cord that is most prominent in the posterior and lateral columns at thoracic levels. The severity of the pathological lesions correlates not only with symptoms and signs of spinal cord disease but also with dementia. Although the incidence of vacuolar myelopathy is increased in patients with HIV encephalitis, its etiology is not yet established.\r"

Six of the patients showed improvement in their neurological dysfunction on being administered AZT, as assessed by clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, nerve conduction studies, and/or positron emission tomographic scans. Three of these 6 patients showed sustained improvement 5 to 18 months after the initiation of AZT therapy. These results suggest that certain human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological abnormalities are at least partially reversible following the administration of antiretroviral therapy and provide a rationale for further studies using antiretroviral chemotherapy.\r"

The majority of these disorders resemble diseases occurring in HIV-seronegative patients and include inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies, multiple mononeuropathies, and polymyositis. In HIV-seronegative patients, these diseases are believed to be immune system-mediated. It is likely that similar pathogenic mechanisms are present in HIV-seropositive patients and reflect an altered immune system caused by viral infection and the loss of CD4 cells. Therapy is similar in both seropositive and seronegative patients with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies, but plasmapheresis is preferred in seropositive patients as it is less likely than corticosteroids to induce further immunosuppression. Distal sensory neuropathy is characteristic in patients infected with HIV, especially those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex, and may be a consequence of HIV infection. Therefore, antiviral agents may have a therapeutic role for this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The biological properties of the ruminant animal lentiviruses, visna and caprine arthritis-encephalitis viruses, closely resemble those of their human counterparts, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). All of these viruses are morphologically identical and are disseminated from host to host in nature during exchange of body fluids. Artificial conditions that favor excess exchange of such fluids precipitate epidemics by these viruses. The strategy of replication of the animal viruses in tissue culture and in vivo are very similar to that of the human virus. Virus replication is highly productive in tissue culture and leads to cytopathic effects characterized by fusion. In vivo, the rate of virus replication is restricted and lesions, suggestive of an immunopathological origin, develop after prolonged periods of subclinical infection. Similar to the animal viruses, the human viruses have a tropism for macrophages in vivo, and this leads somehow to a loss of T helper lymphocytes and proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, the viruses are highly neurotropic and this results in acute fulminating disease in neonatal hosts and chronic encephalopathy in adults. Both animal and human viruses cause persistent infections and have similar strategies for eluding host immune responses. These include sequestration of neutralizing epitopes, induction of low titers of neutralizing antibodies, and antigenic drift during persistent infection. Despite close homology between genetic sequences of HIV-I and -II, these two viruses seem to have as much biological disparity from each other as does visna virus from caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus. The latter two viruses induce neutralizing antibodies that are highly strain specific and show no cross protection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This review has focused primarily on their mechanisms of action, favorable pharmacologic properties, and spectra of activity against a broad range of systemic pathogens. Itraconazole and fluconazole show much promise as orally active agents, with less potential for toxicity than the currently available azoles. Fluconazole and, to a lesser degree, itraconazole are especially promising therapies for cryptococcal meningitis. In addition, fluconazole may prove to be highly effective in urinary tract infections caused by Candida species and other fungi. Ongoing and future clinical trials will more clearly define the specific roles of itraconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of systemic mycoses.\r"

Administration of the antibiotics for 12 days reduced the number of bacteria in livers and the mortality of C57BL/6 mice significantly. Ciprofloxacin was considerably more effective than ampicillin in prolongation of the mean survival time of these mice. Similar to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, ciprofloxacin did not prevent fatal disease in most C57BL/6 mice when the treatment lasted 12 days only. On the other hand, ciprofloxacin cured lethal S. typhimurium illness in immunocompromised mice after long-term oral chemotherapy for 26 days at a dosage of 100 mg/kg twice a day. This was not achieved by either ampicillin or chloramphenicol. In normal mice, 12 days of therapy with ciprofloxacin was sufficient for a significant decrease in both the number of viable bacteria in livers and the mortality of lethally infected mice. The results provide a basis for an alternative antibiotic treatment by the oral route in immunocompromised hosts with systemic infections.\r"

  ".W": "A new procedure for determining the susceptibility of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum to antimicrobial agents was developed, utilizing a tissue culture system which promotes the in vitro multiplication of this organism. In the absence of antibiotics, T. pallidum (Nichols virulent strain) multiplied an average of 10-fold when incubated for 7 days in the presence of Sf1Ep cottontail rabbit epithelial cell cultures. Varied concentrations of penicillin G, tetracycline, erythromycin, and spectinomycin were added to triplicate cultures to determine their effects on treponemal multiplication, motility, and virulence. The MIC of each antibiotic was defined as the lowest concentration which prevented treponemal multiplication, whereas the MBC was defined as the lowest concentration which abrogated the ability of the cultured treponemes to multiply and cause lesions in rabbits. The in vitro culture technique provided highly reproducible MICs and (in parentheses) MBCs of each of the antibiotics tested: aqueous penicillin G, 0.0005 (0.0025) microgram/ml; tetracycline, 0.2 (0.5) microgram/ml; erythromycin, 0.005 (0.005) microgram/ml; and spectinomycin, 0.5 (0.5) microgram/ml. The significance of these results in light of the in vivo activities and the previous in vitro evaluations of these antibiotics is discussed. The T. pallidum in vitro cultivation system shows promise as a method for studying the interaction between T. pallidum and antimicrobial agents and for screening new antibiotics for syphilis therapy.\r"

The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases.

Almost immediate improvement in oxygenation was seen in the treated group so that oxygen concentrations could be reduced and remained significantly lower than those of control babies for the first seven days of life. Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients were also significantly different for the first five days after treatment. More babies in the treatment group survived (79% v 40%) but the difference was not significant. The incidence of pneumothorax and of intraventricular haemorrhage, however, was significantly lower in treated babies compared with controls.

They were followed up until December 1985. Ninety eight children were initially treated by haemodialysis in hospital and 15 by renal transplantation. The average wait on dialysis was seven months (range 0.1-43 months). One hundred and six children were given 129 renal transplants, 32 of which were from living related donors. At the end of 1985 94 of the 113 patients (83%) were alive, 81 (72%) with functioning grafts, 11 (10%) were receiving haemodialysis in hospital, two (1%) were being treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and three had been lost to follow up. The 14 years actuarial survival was 81%. Four patients receiving dialysis and 12 who had received transplants died, a mortality of 14%. The main complications of treatment were retardation of growth in 49 (43%), hypertension in 75 (66%), and osteopathy in 36 (32%). Retardation of growth could not be reversed by successful renal transplantation. Seventy two patients (88%) assessed their health as good to excellent, and 9 (12%) as poor. Patients with a functioning graft did much better than those receiving dialysis. Treatment of end stage renal failure led to full rehabilitation in most patients, and renal transplantation was more effective than dialysis.\r"

All infants with synchronous respiration at fast rates were correctly identified by clinical observation. The clinical signs used to identify 'high risk' interactions--that is, active expiration and asynchronous breathing--were obvious respiratory efforts and a failure of improvement in oxygenation at increased rates. These criteria enabled correct identification of 'high risk' respiratory patterns on 15 (88%) of the 17 study occasions. These clinical criteria were then used as criteria for selective paralysis; no infant developed a pneumothorax during ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "A clinic for diabetic children was established in 1983 in a district general hospital to coordinate the changeover to a standard 100 unit insulin regimen. The children's progress was monitored for the next three years. Glycated haemoglobin A1 (HbA1c), measured at the same time each year, fell from a mean (SD) of 15.8 (4.7)% to 9.9 (2.6)% over the three years. A similar degree of improvement was seen when newly diagnosed patients were excluded from the analysis. This improvement was associated with a rise in mean (SD) insulin dosage from 0.89 (0.29) U/kg/day to 1.17 (0.35) U/kg/day. Good control was achieved more easily in children who had been diabetic for less than two years and in those who were prepubertal (particularly boys). A combination of isophane and soluble insulin appeared to be more effective than zinc and soluble insulin in maintaining good control. Ten complications of diabetes were noted in eight patients from 5.2 to 12.4 years after diagnosis. These results show that setting up a diabetic clinic for children in a district general hospital had a beneficial effect on the quality of diabetic control and such improvement may help to reduce the incidence of diabetic complications.\r"

In all cases the ventilation pressures had to be further increased for 12 hours but rapid improvement followed on the second day so that all four were spontaneously breathing air after a few days. It is postulated that collapse of the airways resulted from oligohydramnios, and that the resulting 'dry lungs' would only respond to high inflation pressures.\r"

Including the patient in the present report, a total of 18 patients have been reported. The most common site of cardiac metastasis was the right atrium. Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain were the most common symptoms associated with cardiac metastases. The median time from the initial diagnosis of primary chondrosarcoma to death was 36 months, and the median time from the initiation of cardiac symptoms to death was 2 months. Treatment of primary chondrosarcoma included local radical resection in 14 patients. Treatment of cardiac metastases consisted of palliative support in 13 patients and surgical resection in 5 patients. Median survival following the development of cardiac symptoms was 2 months for patients treated nonsurgically and 18 months for those who underwent resection of cardiac metastases. The longest survival (24 and 28 months) was obtained in 2 patients with metastases confined to the heart that were successfully resected soon after development of cardiac symptoms. These results suggest that surgical resection of cardiac metastases in patients without widespread other metastases can result in substantial prolongation of life.\r"

Although RPE generally is believed to occur only when a chronically collapsed lung is rapidly reexpanded by evacuation of large amounts of air or fluid, in this review 15 of 47 cases of RPE available for assessment occurred when the pulmonary collapse was of short duration or when the lung was reexpanded without suction. The pathogenesis of RPE is unknown and is probably multifactorial. Implicated in the etiological process of RPE are chronicity of collapse, technique of reexpansion, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, airway obstruction, loss of surfactant, and pulmonary artery pressure changes. Since the outcome of RPE was fatal in 11 of 53 cases reviewed (20%), physicians treating lung collapse must be aware of the possible causes and endeavor to prevent the occurrence of this complication.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic pain patients share many characteristics, but there is important prognostic variability among them. By selecting for certain characteristics, different recruitment methods and entry criteria for clinical or research programs may influence the likelihood of success regardless of treatment efficacy. This was demonstrated when subjects (n = 55) were recruited through lay publicity for a clinical trial of therapy for chronic back pain. In comparison to routine pain clinic patients (n=61), subjects in the clinical trial were better educated, were more often employed, had more favorable personality profiles, and were less likely to have had surgery or narcotic use (all p less than 0.004). Pain relief was significantly better for clinical trial subjects, apparently due to baseline prognostic differences rather than uniquely efficacious therapy. We conclude that chronic pain patients vary in prognostically important ways; that recruitment methods and criteria strongly influence these characteristics; and that greater attention to these details is needed when interpreting and reporting clinical research.\r"

This paper introduces and relates the presentations made in a symposium entitled \"Myofascial Pain Syndromes: Where are we? Where are we going?\" at the 47th Annual Assembly of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Kansas City October 2, 1985. It summarizes a number of recent research advances and key research issues related to myofascial pain syndromes: 1. Thermography appears valuable for imaging the reflex thermal tracks of previously identified TrPs. 2. Three new devices are reported to measure reliably the pressure threshold for pain of TrPs and tender points (TePs). 3. Fibrositis/fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndromes may or may not be separate entities. The question needs to be resolved. 4. New evidence strongly supports previous indications that a TrP is a region of increased energy consumption with an inadequate oxygen supply. 5. A foundation has been established for investigating the sensitizing agent(s) responsible for the increased sensitivity of TrPs and muscular TePs. 6. At least four mechanisms can account for the pain referred by TrPs in muscles. The convergence-projection mechanism appears to be consistently present in visceral pain pathways and to be likely in mammalian muscle nociceptive pathways.\r"

Within T1, diameter was highly significant. Cell type and time of operation (before or after Dec 31, 1980) were also significant. Under T2, only scarring and differentiation were significant. Veterans in this group live longer if they have small squamous cell tumors.\r"

Twenty-four hours later a sublethal intraperitoneal inoculation of Escherichia coli was given after core body temperature regulation at 32 degrees C to 40 degrees C, which was maintained for 30 minutes. Killing of the rats at 1, 3, or 6 hours later allowed evaluation of peritoneal white blood cell and bacterial counts. Results demonstrated that MDP (independent of core body temperature) caused an increased peritoneal white blood cell response at one and six hours and an increased peritoneal bacterial clearance at three hours. Increasing core body temperature adversely affected peritoneal bacterial clearance. High-dose MDP was clearly significant in acceleration of peritoneal bacterial clearance. No interaction between MDP and core body temperature was seen.\r"

The sensitivity of Doppler ultrasound was 86%, of laser Doppler flow velocity 85%, of laser Doppler index 94%, and of perfusion fluorometry 95%. Though the sensitivity of Doppler ultrasound is significantly less than that of laser Doppler and perfusion fluorometry, this is not unexpected since the latter two techniques are more quantitative than Doppler ultrasound. Clinically, Doppler ultrasound compares favorably with laser Doppler and perfusion fluorometry, and its low cost and simplicity suggest its adjunctive use in the operative setting.\r"

However, actual or impending perforation constitutes an absolute indication for prompt operative intervention. To discriminate these cases from those undergoing observation with conservative treatment, clinical and ultrasonographic findings were reviewed and analyzed in 17 patients with acute cholecystitis. Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of ultrasonography in discriminating cases of acute cholecystitis, in terms of timing of operative intervention, were calculated retrospectively based on the operative findings. The risk score for each ultrasonographic finding was determined, and the total risk score was calculated for each patient. The calculated total risk score was found to be well correlated with the macroscopic appearance of the gallbladder at operation in cases of acute cholecystitis. Therefore, this score should be useful in determining the timing of operative intervention for acute cholecystitis. However, the usefulness of the variables should further be established prospectively in other patient populations.\r"

Mild leukopenia (3 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), and elevated transaminase levels (8 patients) resolved with temporary drug discontinuation. No patient withdrew due to drug toxicity. Liver biopsy specimens in 17 patients after 24 months of treatment showed no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. A significant increase in the percentage of T3 and T4 blood cells and increases in lymphocyte proliferation to concanavalin A and purified protein derivative of tuberculin were found after 2 years of therapy. Our findings indicate that methotrexate has remained effective over 36 months of therapy, with acceptable toxicity levels and no evidence of systemic immunosuppression.\r"

The coexistence of a lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis with a radicular syndrome should therefore encourage early investigation by computed tomography scan, so that conservative treatment would not be unnecessarily prolonged.\r"

This process is inhibited by neutral serine protease inhibitors. This suggests that the desmosome-tonofilament complex, more precisely the desmosomal dense plaque, is the primary target of activated proteases during cantharide acantholysis, and can be disrupted by a specific epidermal protease-anti protease system. Cantharide acantholysis may be useful model for studying desmosomal turnover.\r"

Positive sera from five adult LAD patients, 15 CBDC patients, three BP patients and two EBA patients were studied, using skin and mucosal tissues of humans and animals as substrates. The tissue distribution and phylogenetic distribution of adult LAD antigen and CBDC antigen were the same, suggesting that they are identical diseases. The antigens were both demonstrable only in stratified squamous epithelia and amnion of mammalian species. They were absent from transitional and columnar epithelium. The EBA antigen was not expressed in pig tissues or human placenta, unlike adult LAD and CBDC antigens. Expression of adult LAD, CBDC and BP antigens was observed in all tissues except bladder, which lacked LAD and CBDC antigens. These results suggest that the antigens in adult LAD and CBDC are the same and differ from EP and EBA antigens.\r"

Within 4 weeks the mean reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) in 10 patients receiving CyA (mean dose 5.5 mg/kg/day) differed significantly from the mean reduction in 10 patients receiving placebo. In eight patients given placebo a switch to CyA therapy resulted within 4 weeks in a mean reduction in PASI of 90%. In a total 15 out of 18 patients given CyA (83%) (mean dose 5.6 mg/kg/day) there was an improvement of greater than or equal to 75% in PASI within 4 weeks. In a 2-month tapering off phase a lower mean CyA dose (3 mg/kg/day) was effective in maintaining the reduced PASI scores in seven of nine patients. Four out of five CyA treated patients who entered a post-treatment observation phase had a relapse (PASI score greater than or equal to 50% of score at baseline) after a mean interval of 6.5 weeks. The most important side-effects were mild reversible hypertension in 5 of 18 patients (28%), and reversible elevated serum creatinine levels in 7 of 18 patients (39%). We consider that further studies are justified in severe chronic psoriasis to establish suitable regimens for maintenance of remission in psoriasis with low-doses of CyA or a combination of CyA with other anti-psoriatic agents.\r"

Biopsies from clinically uninvolved bulbar conjunctiva were taken for direct immunofluorescence and blood was taken for indirect immunofluorescence using normal human conjunctiva, oral mucosa and skin as substrates. On direct immunofluorescence, in vivo bound immunoglobulins were found along the basement membrane in 10 of the 17 patients with cicatricial pemphigoid, one of the five with pseudopemphigoid and two of the seven with a cicatrizing conjunctivitis associated with other diseases. Circulating anti-basement membrane zone antibodies were found only when conjunctiva was used as a substrate. These were present in seven of the patients with cicatricial pemphigoid, three of those with pseudopemphigoid and two of those with a cicatrizing conjunctivitis caused by other diseases. These results indicate that direct immunofluorescence is a useful, but not absolute diagnostic marker for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. The results in the pseudopemphigoid group argue that this is an immunologically mediated disorder indistinguishable from spontaneous cicatricial pemphigoid and probably triggered by the drugs. The presence of circulating antibodies should allow for precise identification of the antigen involved in cicatricial pemphigoid using SDS electrophoresis and Western blot analysis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of ultrasound in hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) and to analyse the correlation between the dimensions of the pyloric muscle and the age and the weight of the child, 34 children with suspected HPS and 34 controls were examined. An overlap between the dimensions of the pyloric muscle in the HPS group and in the controls stresses the need to assess the muscle length, the muscle diameter, and the muscle wall thickness in establishing the sonographic diagnosis of HPS. We found the following criteria useful: muscle length greater than or equal to 19 mm, muscle diameter greater than or equal to 10 mm, and muscle wall thickness greater than or equal to 4 mm. The results did not confirm previous reports of increasing dimensions of the pyloric muscle with age and weight.\r"

Numerous evaluations of the performance of these systems have been reported in the literature. However systematic evaluations of the processing functions of DSA image processors have not been widely reported. Such an evaluation for one commercial system is presented in this paper. Functions evaluated include linear transformation, logarithmic transformation, integration, subtraction and temporal filtration. The observations indicate that image processing results are frequently achieved by indirect routes which compromise the fidelity of the image data.\r"

These consist of bilateral, asymmetrical widening and irregularity of the distal radial growth plates with an ill-defined cystic appearance, sclerosis and flaring of the metaphyses in all eight cases. Similar but less marked changes were present in the distal ulnar growth plates in five cases. The aetiology is thought to be that of a Salter Type I stress fracture of the growth plate due to chronic repetitive shear forces applied to the hyperextended wrist joint. Rapid healing of the stress fracture will occur with cessation of the sporting activity but continued strenuous use of the wrists will result in further widening and irregularity of the growth plate. The differential diagnosis of the radiographic appearances and previous literature are discussed.\r"

An attempt was made to define optimal sequences in the evaluation of both normal and pathological transplants. Three sequences were found to be of value; a T1 weighted sequence (IR2180/700/40) to assess corticomedullary differentiation and its loss in acute rejection and acute tubular necrosis, a T2 weighted sequence (SE2000/80) for assessment of renal vessels and disturbances in blood supply, and a STIR (short tau inversion recovery) sequence (IR800/100/40) to define further the distended collecting system in obstruction and the presence of any perirenal collection. Encouraging results have been obtained, particularly in cases of acute rejection. It is suggested that the MRI scan is a useful screening test in cases of clinical doubt and may even obviate biopsy in some cases.\r"

A series of 452 symptomatic women examined by both ultrasound and conventional X-ray mammography was reviewed to determine whether these ultrasonographic images could predict the breast parenchymal pattern defined mammographically. A very strong correlation was demonstrated between the breast pattern on ultrasound and the volume of the breast replaced by either dysplasia (Kendall's tau-b = 0.731 +/- 0.026, p less than 0.0001) or ductal prominence (Kendall's tau-b = 0.641 +/- 0.049, p less than 0.0001). This was seen both on initial reporting and on a blind re-reading of a random sample of 100 cases. The strength of correlation was similar for subgroups defined by family history of breast cancer, age, menopausal status, and history of benign breast disease, and the breast parenchymal pattern assessed by mammography or ultrasound showed similar associations with these variables. Ultrasonographic parenchymal patterns of the breast can predict the tissue patterns defined mammographically and may therefore be useful as a marker of breast cancer risk.\r"

Because the regimes considered involved fairly closely-spaced fractions, delivered at dose rates in the range 1.2-72 Gy h-1, it was necessary to further develop previously established forms of the model in order to carry out the evaluation. The magnitude of the recovery half-life has been deduced for each of the regimes and found to be in the approximate range 0.1-0.6 h. For any given fraction number, the half-life appears to be markedly dependent on dose rate, increasing with dose rate up to approximately 25 Gy h-1, falling off thereafter. Tentative reasons for this behaviour are given, together with an assessment of the possible shortcomings of the analytical method.\r"

Features consistent with a primary colonic neoplasm were reported in 35 patients. In 14 patients, ultrasound indicated the possibility of a colonic neoplasm in the absence of a clinically palpable mass. An intraabdominal mass was confirmed in 12 patients (86%), and was a primary colonic neoplasm in 11 patients (79%). In one patient a metastatic malignant mass had been misinterpreted as arising from the colon. In two patients no lesion could be demonstrated to account for the ultrasonographic abnormality. In a further 21 patients in which an abdominal mass had been evident on clinical examination, ultrasound was performed for further elucidation and indicated the mass to be arising from the colon. In this group, a primary colonic neoplasm was the cause in 11 patients (52%), while other primary or metastatic malignancy was found in six patients (29%) and benign disease in four patients (19%). We conclude that ultrasound is a useful primary diagnostic technique for colonic neoplasms, with a predictive value of 79% in detecting clinically non-palpable lesions. In our experience, false positive results due to scanning artefacts are rare. We consider that examination of the bowel is a worthwhile addition to the routine scan in patients with non-specific abdominal complaints.\r"

The use of an undercouch tube in DSA and an increased focus-lens distance, when compared with the conventional angiographic approach were considered the major factors contributing to the difference in lens dose.

Satisfactory operative cholangiograms were a prerequisite to evaluation of the statistical method and were obtained in 90.4 per cent of cases. Using the computerized method a common bile duct stone would have been overlooked in only 1 patient but 17 unnecessary explorations would have been carried out. The overall accuracy of the computerized method was 92.5 per cent. When the method was applied to a further study of 97 patients from a separate centre the overall accuracy was 85.6 per cent. If the method was used to aid selective use of operative cholangiography, cholangiograms would be performed in 20 per cent and stones would be overlooked in less than 1 per cent.\r"

Over 100 patients have been reported in whom both processes have occurred concurrently, but doubts have been expressed as to whether or not this association is due to chance. We report 10 new cases of hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism associated with different types of pancreatitis. Seven patients had primary hyperparathyroidism and three had hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation. Two experienced acute pancreatitis after parathyroidectomy. Of the remaining eight patients, five had hypercalcaemia equal to or above 120 mg/l. The prevalence of pancreatitis in our series of 86 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism is 8 per cent. Acute and chronic calcifying types of pancreatitis were observed. Three patients died of the disease, two of them after renal transplantation. It is suggested that pancreatitis may complicate the clinical course of hyperparathyroidism, particularly when hypercalcaemia is moderate to severe and/or there are other risk factors such as treatment with steroids and azathioprine after renal transplantation.\r"

Splenectomy results in increased susceptibility to infection with encapsulated organisms but its effect on the resistance to postoperative Gram-negative infection has been little studied. We have investigated the effect of splenectomy on RES function by measurement of plasma fibronectin concentrations and bacterial clearance in the presence and absence of sepsis. In experiment 1, rabbits underwent splenectomy (n = 8) or laparotomy only (n = 8) 4 weeks before a second laparotomy. In experiment 2, animals had either splenectomy (n = 8) or laparotomy only (n = 8) followed 4 weeks later by devascularization of the appendix (sepsis). Plasma fibronectin concentrations and the blood clearance and organ distribution of an intravenous injection of 75Se-labelled viable Escherichia coli (2-3 X 10(8) colony forming units (c.f.u.] were measured 24 h after the second operation. Splenectomy resulted in: (1) a persistent reduction in plasma fibronectin concentration in the presence and absence of sepsis, and (2) a delay in the bloodstream clearance with reduced hepatic (Kupffer cell) uptake of E. coli which was exaggerated in the septic splenectomized animal. It is concluded that the spleen may be important for Gram-negative bacterial clearance, possibly related to its influence on plasma fibronectin concentration and Kupffer cell function.\r"

With the development of sapphire probes capable of transmitting neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd: YAG) laser light, it is now feasible to perform direct-contact low-power laser surgery. In a small randomized controlled trial, we have compared cholecystectomy performed by conventional methods (n = 11) with the same operation performed by contact laser (n = 10). Operative time, blood loss, operative stability, analgesic requirement, mobility and response to the trauma of surgery were compared. The only differences between the two groups were a significantly increased wound infection rate (P = 0.051) in the laser surgery group and a significantly increased length of operating time (P = 0.001). Thus, the laser did not confer any advantage over conventional surgery.\r"

An unequivocal indication as to the presence or absence of a testicular torsion was obtained in 31 patients (76 per cent), an equivocal result was obtained in 5 patients and in 5 patients the examination was unsatisfactory. The sensitivity and specificity of the investigation for the diagnosis of testicular torsion were 67 per cent and 83 per cent respectively, and the predictive value of either a positive or negative result was 100 per cent. Our results suggest that the use of Doppler ultrasonography could reduce the incidence of unnecessary operations without incurring the risk of reduced testicular salvage.\r"

A prospective study was devised to determine whether this accuracy could be translated into improved management of patients with breast carcinoma. A total of 223 patients with palpable breast masses were assessed by clinical examination, imaging (X-ray and ultrasound mammography) and aspiration cytology. Each was scored on a five-point scale and treatment was planned according to the total score. According to the protocol, an adequate total score would permit definitive surgery avoiding frozen section. By using sonography rather than radiology, the number of correct diagnoses could be improved by 25 per cent. This was because the greater sensitivity of ultrasound (92.8 per cent) compared to X-ray mammography (82.5 per cent) was reflected in a higher total score, which was sufficient to allow definitive surgical treatment without prior histological confirmation of diagnosis.\r"

The study was performed to clarify the relative merits of the two techniques. Our results show that ultrasound and a plain abdominal radiograph should be the examination of first choice in most circumstances. This is particularly so in vague abdominal pain and in recurrent urinary tract infections where intravenous urography can usually be omitted or used only as a secondary investigation for further evaluation of abnormal ultrasound findings. In acute renal colic, intravenous urography should be the primary investigation. In macroscopic haematuria, initial examination by ultrasound would reliably diagnose mass lesions, show whether the lesion is cystic or solid and assess possible spread. Normal ultrasound does not exclude haematuria due to ureteric lesions or bladder lesions and intravenous urography is recommended.\r"

Therapy was initiated within 90 days of resection of all evident tumor and continued until 2 years of disease-free survival or the occurrence of unresectable dissemination of melanoma. Known prognostic variables were similarly distributed in the treatment and control groups, documenting the randomization efficacy. Three endpoints were analyzed: disease-free interval, time to Stage III metastasis, and survival. After a median follow-up period of 24.75 months, there was a trend in favor of the placebo group with regard to all three endpoints and this was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) for time to Stage III metastasis.

The subcutaneous transplants of each tumor conserved the morphological characteristics of one component of the primary tumor, namely an embryonal carcinoma in one case and a yolk sac tumor in two. The latter maintained the capacity to synthesize alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). After intraperitoneal injection of cell suspensions, tumors, either attached to or even invading abdominal organs or in the form of free-floating tumor spheroids, were observed. AFP could be localized within the attached growths but not in the spheroids. A critical tumor volume and/or vascularization seemed to be necessary for AFP production in tumor cells. In spheroids from one tumor, cytogenetic analysis revealed both human and murine cells. Thus, these spheroids, apparently composed of tumor cells in the center and murine cells at the periphery, can not be considered to be embryoid bodies.\r"

A leukemic peripheral blood (leukocyte count 24.5 x 10(9)/l) composed predominantly of cerebriform cells was found in a 75-year-old man presenting with weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy but without skin lesions. Cell suspensions studies and immunohistochemistry of peripheral blood revealed that the cerebriform cells were B-cells (IgM+ Kappa+, HLA DR+, Leu 1+, CALLA-, B1+, and OKT 10+). A variety of T-cell markers (other than Leu1) was negative. Computer-assisted morphometry confirmed a nuclear profile typical of CTCL (mean nuclear contour index, 7.47). A lymph node that underwent subsequent biopsy revealed a follicular malignant lymphoma of small to intermediate cells with similar morphologic and immunologic characteristics to the circulating cerebriform cells. The findings of a leukemic presentation of a cerebriform B-cell lymphoma extends the recent observation of nodal B-cell lymphomas composed of cerebriform cells and indicates that circulating cerebriform cells should not be considered to be exclusively of T-cell origin.\r"

Its plasma levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (E-1023) using an anti-DCP monoclonal antibody in 514 patients with various diseases. Of 120 patients with HCC, 76 (63%) had abnormal DCP levels greater than 0.1 arbitrary unit (AU)/ml and 58 (48%) showed levels greater than 0.3 AU/ml. When a diagnostic minimum level of 0.3 AU/ml was applied for DCP, false-positive cases of HCC were virtually eliminated. In some patients with HCC, plasma DCP levels normalized after surgical resection of the tumor. However, they rose again later with recurrence of the disease. The sensitivity of DCP in the diagnosis and monitoring of HCC was increased by serial and simultaneous determinations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), because high DCP levels were observed more often in low AFP-producing HCC patients. Elevated plasma DCP levels were not related to low vitamin K concentration in the serum. In fact, in many patients vitamin K administration resulted in only a moderate reduction of DCP levels. These results suggested strongly that DCP was synthesized by the hepatoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "The study was designed to compare the frequency and severity of postoperative vomiting in paediatric out-patients receiving controlled ventilation (IPPV) or breathing spontaneously (SV) during anaesthesia for strabismus repair. One hundred and twenty unpremedicated children (ages 2-12 years) were studied in a randomized fashion. After intravenous induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation, patients breathed halothane 1-1.5 per cent inspired and N2O 66 per cent in O2 spontaneously (n = 60), or received IPPV, halothane 0.5-1 per cent, N2O 66 per cent, and pancuronium 0.05 mg.kg-1, which was reversed with neostigmine and atropine (n = 60). The incidence of vomiting with SV was 50 per cent (95 per cent confidence limits: 34.5-65.5 per cent) compared with 40 per cent (24.5-55.5 per cent) with IPPV (p greater than 0.25). Patients in the SV group experiencing emesis had longer operations than those not vomiting (mean +/- SEM = 1.5 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 hours, p less than 0.005). This was not the case with IPPV. There was no correlation between age, sex, duration of surgery, or number of extraocular muscles repaired, and frequency or severity of vomiting or time to discharge. No significant advantage was afforded by IPPV over SV in the present study.\r"

AII neither stimulated proliferation of cells made quiescent in a defined serum-free media nor augmented cell proliferation induced by serum or platelet-derived growth factor. However, AII did induce cellular hypertrophy of postconfluent quiescent cultures following 4 days of treatment, increasing smooth muscle cell protein content by 20% as compared with vehicle-treated controls. AII-induced hypertrophy was maximal at 1 microM, had an ED50 of 5 nM, and was blocked by the specific AII receptor antagonist Sar1,Ile8 AII. The cellular hypertrophy was due to an increase in protein synthesis, which was elevated within 6-9 hours following AII treatment, while no changes in protein degradation were apparent. AII was even more effective in inducing hypertrophy of subconfluent cultures, causing a 38% increase in protein content after 4 days of treatment (1 microM) and showing a maximal response at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. Interestingly, in subconfluent cultures, AII treatment (1 microM, 4 days) was associated with a 50% increase in the fraction of cells with 4C DNA content with the virtual absence of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, consistent with either arrest of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle or development of tetraploidy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After drug washout, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-carnitine (2 g bid, orally) for a period of 3 weeks and were then crossed over to the other treatment for an additional 3 weeks. The effect on walking distance at the end of each treatment period was measured by treadmill test. Absolute walking distance rose from 174 +/- 63 m with placebo to 306 +/- 122 m (p less than .01) with carnitine. Biopsy of the ischemic muscle, carried out before and after 15 days of L-carnitine administration in four additional patients, showed that treatment significantly increased total carnitine levels. An additional goal of this study was to ascertain the effects of L-carnitine on the metabolic changes induced by exercise in the affected limb. In six patients under control conditions, arterial and popliteal venous lactate and pyruvate concentrations were determined at rest, when the maximal walking distance was reached, and 5 min after the walking test. Twenty-four hours later, L-carnitine was administered intravenously (3 g as a bolus followed by an infusion of 2 mg/kg/min for 30 min) and metabolic assessments were repeated. Five minutes after the walking test, popliteal venous lactate concentration increased by 107 +/- 16% before treatment and by only 54 +/- 32% (p less than .01) after carnitine. Furthermore, carnitine induced a more rapid recovery to the resting value of the lactate/pyruvate ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of oral nifedipine and diltiazem were compared in 20 patients with stable angina pectoris with use of a placebo run-in, randomized, double-blind titration to maximal effect crossover protocol. The effects of treatment withdrawal were also analyzed. All patients received placebo for 2 weeks and were then randomly assigned to receive either diltiazem or nifedipine. A 2 week drug titration phase in which patients received either diltiazem (180 to 360 mg/day) or nifedipine (30 to 120 mg/day) in three divided doses was followed by a 1 week maintenance phase. Patients then received placebo for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by crossover to the other treatment regimen and a second placebo washout period of 1 week. Patients (n = 13) who remained symptomatic on both diltiazem and nifedipine during the monotherapy periods entered a 3 week combination treatment phase, followed by a final 1 week placebo washout period. Frequency of angina, nitroglycerin consumption, exercise tolerance (Naughton protocol), and frequency of daily episodes of ST segment deviations on the electrocardiogram (1 mm of ST segment depression persisting for at least 1 min with and without chest pain) on an ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor were assessed during the baseline placebo, active monotherapy, placebo withdrawal, and combination treatment phases. Plasma drug levels were also measured. Compared with initial placebo values, the frequency of angina and the amount of nitroglycerin treatment were reduced by both diltiazem (p less than .001) and nifedipine (p less than .02). Diltiazem was more effective than nifedipine in reducing angina (p less than .02). Exercise duration increased with both drugs (p less than .0001). Diltiazem was significantly better than nifedipine in reducing the episodes of ST segment depression on the ambulatory monitor (p less than .01). Diltiazem reduced the resting heart rate (p less than .01); both drugs reduced the resting blood pressure and rate-pressure product. Overall, combination therapy was more effective in patients who did not maximally respond to diltiazem or nifedipine alone with respect to anginal and exercise variables and in reducing blood pressure at rest and during exercise. Plasma drug levels could not predict an individual patient's treatment response. Diltiazem may increase nifedipine drug levels when the drugs are combined. Fewer side effects were observed with diltiazem than nifedipine; the most side effects were seen with combination treatment. There were no apparent withdrawal effects observed with either treatment regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Improved survival rates with internal mammary artery grafts were noted at hospitals in which these grafts were performed infrequently as well as those in which the internal mammary artery graft was used frequently.

The internal mammary artery bypass graft was an independent predictor of survival (p = .0004) and reduced the risk of dying by a factor of 0.64. It was concluded that the internal mammary artery graft is the bypass vessel of choice and should not be denied any subgroup.\r"

Abnormalities of disc, bone, muscle, and collagen do not appear to be etiological factors but, rather, reflect the effects of scoliosis on normal tissues. Although most patients with idiopathic scoliosis are thought of as tall and slender, it has not yet been proven that growth in this condition differs from normal. It is possible that idiopathic scoliosis is caused by multiple factors rather than a single factor. Perhaps there are different factors for curve initiation and curve progression. It appears that a brain stem or equilibrium abnormality does exist in patients with idiopathic scoliosis, although more research is needed to confirm and define the problem. There also may be a genetic basis for idiopathic scoliosis, as it does seem to occur within patients' families more frequently than in the general population. Whether these two factors form the basis for a multifactorial etiology of idiopathic scoliosis remains to be proven.\r"

Intraoperatively, six patients (2%) demonstrated significant changes in evoked potentials, consisting of either marked increase in latency or a loss of wave form during instrumentation of the spine. The instrumentation was removed immediately and the evoked potentials returned to base-line tracing within 15-30 minutes in all six cases. Five patients who had instruments refitted to maintain a lesser amount of correction had no subsequent change in the evoked potentials. One patient had spinal fusion without instrumentation. Postoperatively, all patients are neurologically normal.\r"

The most common pathogen responsible for late prosthetic joint infections was staphylococcus (54%; both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), even when infection was of dental origin. The three most common origins of infection were skin and soft tissue (46%), dental (15%), and urinary (13%). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen when the source was the urinary tract. Mortality and cost calculations indicate that chemoprophylaxis is justified for dental procedures and probably also for other surgical procedures in organs containing microflora. Prophylaxis must include antistaphylococcal drugs. The first generation cephalosporin antibiotics are recommended.\r"

The current information on its natural history indicates that a large number of patients have minor degrees of curvature (approximately 100 per 1000 individuals), although only about two per 1000 individuals warrant treatment because of curve progression. A large number of these curves do not increase even without treatment. Prognostic indicators such as growth, menarch, Risser sign, age at diagnosis, and sex are useful for predicting curve progression but are not always precise. Nonpredictive factors include family history, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, lumbosacral transitional anomalies, and trunk balance. Future growth potential and curve severity remain the most reliable considerations in predicting the course of the disorder and in devising suitable approaches to treatment.\r"

In 14 animals, the profundus tendon of the long toe on both feet was lacerated and repaired in zone 2. In the right foot, the sheath was repaired, and on the left foot, the sheath was excised. Segments proximal and distal to the laceration site were studied at six weeks postrepair compared to control segments. Sheath excision versus sheath repair had no effect on the net matrix formation of the healing flexor tendon. A higher DNA content and lower hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents were present in the healing tendons, indicating the healing process was not complete at six weeks. Sheath excision versus sheath repair had no effect on net matrix formation in the healing tendon. There is no difference in DNA content or glycosaminoglycan content in the proximal versus distal segments. There was a significantly greater net hydroxyproline content in the proximal segment versus the distal segment of the healing tendon, which was not present in similar control segments. These results support the concept that the zone 2 flexor tendon does not respond to injury as a homogeneous structure.\r"

The Wisconsin system is currently the instrumentation of choice at the authors' clinic for routine idiopathic scoliosis. The quest for the ideal spinal instrumentation system will probably never end. Further improvements on the current systems will inevitably appear, and new concepts will be developed. Spine surgeons will continue to be faced with the need to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different systems.\r"

  ".W": "By combining surgical and anesthetic techniques that minimize blood loss with the use of autotransfusion, it should now be possible to complete a routine posterior spinal fusion without using allogeneic blood transfusions. Surgical efforts should include careful preoperative planning, positioning with the abdomen hanging free, use of topical hemostatic agents, and decortication late in the procedure. Preoperatively donated autogeneic blood or reclaimed red cells from suction can take the place of allogeneic transfusions. Blood loss during scoliosis surgery correlates closely with left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI), a measure of blood flow calculated from systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, and heart rate. All of these parameters are under the anesthesiologist's control, making him the primary determinant of blood loss in scoliosis surgery. Induced hypotensive anesthesia may be ineffective in controlling blood loss if the cardiac output or heart rate is high. Halothane, a commonly used hypotensive agent, is not very useful for scoliosis surgery because spinal cord monitoring and wake-up testing are not possible. Rebound hypertension has been noted with the use of sodium nitroprusside. Trimethaphan works well clinically but experimentally it reduces spinal cord blood flow, which may increase the risk of spinal cord injury.\r"

They were studied retrospectively in order to determine the pseudarthrosis rate, the quality of fusion mass obtained, the rate of infection, volume of blood lost, and operative time. The results showed that it is likely that the graft material used is not as important as the fusion technique. Strict adherence to facet obliteration, posterior element decortication, thorough removal of all soft tissue, and stable, well-planned instrumentation are probably the most important factors in preventing pseudarthrosis. With the complications associated with iliac crest graft and the potential benefits of reduced operative time and blood loss, use of allogeneic bone appears justified.\r"

Patients with hip pain were initially evaluated by plain radiographs of the pelvis and hips. If no diagnosis was reached, the hips were studied for effusions by real-time hip ultrasonography. If an effusion was present, the joint was aspirated for diagnosis. If no effusion was present by US or if no diagnosis was reached by aspiration, triple phase radionuclide bone scans were performed. Fifty patients were evaluated by this prospective protocol, and the diagnosis was reached in 48 of the 50 cases (10 by plain radiographs, 16 by US, and aspiration of the joint, and 22 by triple phase bone scans). Hip effusions were found in 20 patients by US, with no false positives or false negatives. Previous studies for detecting effusions by US have emphasized absolute measurements of the capsular width, but we report a typical appearance of the hip capsule when fluid is present (a bulging convex capsule). When no effusion is present, the capsule is concave and parallels the long axis of the femoral neck.\r"

A positive correlation between the concentration of SLS and SBF was found. Compared with control sites, SBF in weak (+) and strong (++) positive allergic and irritant reactions was increased approximately 5-10 fold 1 and 2 days after application, and decreased towards normal 7 days after application. At day 7, the mean SBF was higher in allergic reactions than in irritant reactions. However, no consistent differences were found. It is concluded that although LDF can be used to quantify the strength of allergic and irritant skin reactions, this method cannot be used solely to separate these 2 types of reaction.\r"

Dopamine increased cardiac output at 16 to 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05) and increased heart rate (HR) at 4 to 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05). Dobutamine produced an increased cardiac output at doses of 16 to 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05), and increased HR at 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05), decreased systemic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance at 16 to 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05), decreased renal vascular resistance at 16 to 32 micrograms/kg.min, and increased renal blood flow at 4.8 and 32 micrograms/kg.min (p less than .05). We conclude that dopamine and dobutamine increase cardiac output in healthy, conscious piglets primarily by increasing HR. Neither agent was effective in increasing stroke volume, although a positive inotropic effect obscured by tachycardia cannot be ruled out. Dobutamine was the superior agent for renal vasodilation, whereas neither agent produced significant pulmonary vasodilation.\r"

Esmolol obtained an initial therapeutic response in nine (60 percent) patients. Mean heart rate for the 15 patients was reduced from 139 +/- 12 beats/min before therapy to 106 +/- 21 beats/min during esmolol infusion (p less than 0.01). The mean time to a therapeutic response after initiation of therapy, using a multistep titration regimen (500 micrograms/kg/min loading infusions over one minute, prior to incremental titration steps from 50 to 300 micrograms/kg/min over 4 to 14 minutes), was 22 +/- 9 minutes, and therapy was continued for 17 +/- 9 hours in responders. Esmolol significantly lowered blood pressure in the group studied and resulted in mild supine or orthostatic hypotension in ten (67 percent) patients. Side effects, including hypotension (10/15 patients), gastrointestinal disturbances (2/15), and weakness or somnolence (6/15), were transient and were not associated with serious clinical sequelae. We conclude that esmolol is effective for rate control in a majority of postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Side effects, although mild, occur relatively frequently, limiting prolonged infusions and warranting close surveillance of patients.\r"

The system consisted of a solid-state pressure sensor connected with plastic tubing to the side port of the nasal CPAP mask, a power supply, and a strip chart recorder. The device was validated against standard polysomnography in ten patients with obstructive sleep apnea undergoing overnight nasal CPAP trials. A total of 397 apneas and hypopneas were observed in the ten patients. The PSS device detected 386 events (sensitivity, 97.2 percent). In addition, there were 29 false positive events noted by the device (positive predictive value, 93 percent). The device was then tested at home in 23 patients on nasal CPAP. Eight of these patients had persistent apneas requiring adjustment of their CPAP pressure. The PSS device allowed for accurate reevaluation of nasal CPAP settings in the patient's home without necessitating expensive, time-consuming in-hospital laboratory polysomnographic studies.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference between the mean pulmonary function test results of the control vs the HMD group. The mean N2 delta of the five HMD patients who required assisted ventilation was significantly different from that of the control group. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, as estimated by the dose of methacholine aerosol necessary to provoke a 35 percent fall in SGaw did not differ between the control and HMD groups. In the absence of prematurity, low birth weight (less than 1,500 g), and requirement for positive pressure ventilation, HMD is not associated with an increase in nonspecific airway reactivity or abnormal pulmonary function in adulthood.\r"

  ".W": "To minimize work of breathing, airway pressure should not fluctuate during spontaneous breathing with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, flow resistance in the inspiratory limb of the breathing circuit and an inadequate continuous gas flow rate result in airway pressure fluctuation and increased work of breathing. Flow resistance of the expiratory pressure/exhalation valve also directly affects the level of airway pressure during spontaneous inhalation with CPAP (the greater the resistance of the valve, the greater the decrease in airway pressure and work of breathing). We compared this effect with three types of expiratory pressure valves: a threshold resistor with low resistance to flow, an inflatable balloon (mushroom) valve with moderate resistance to flow, and a variable-orifice flow resistor with a high resistance to flow. Work increased up to threefold with the balloon valve and more than tenfold with the flow resistor compared with the threshold resistor. To apply CPAP, expiratory pressure valves with low resistance to flow should be used to minimize fluctuations in airway pressure and, thus, in the work of spontaneous breathing.\r"

The convenience of oral dosing, combined with avoidance of the significant toxicities associated with AMB, make ketoconazole an attractive alternative for the treatment of selected forms of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. Although high-dose (800 mg/day) ketoconazole is generally more effective than low-dose (400 mg/day), therapy should be initiated at the lower dose due to significantly more adverse effects at higher doses; the daily dose should be increased in patients with progressive disease. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole is used to treat patients with GU tract disease and in patients with naturally occurring or pharmacologically induced achlorhydria. Thus, AMB remains the drug of choice for difficult to treat cases of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis; however, recent studies have established ketoconazole as the drug of choice in immunocompetent patients with non-life-threatening, non-meningeal H capsulatum and B dermatitidis disease.\r"

In this study, a canine preparation was used to compare the immediate results of three different techniques of ileal J-pouch construction. The three methods studied were two-layer hand-suturing (HS), stapling through enterotomies placed laterally on the ileal limbs (LS), and stapling via an apically placed enterotomy (AS). All three techniques resulted in watertight reservoirs. Ease of construction was scored significantly differently among the pouch variations (AS greater than LS greater than HS). Construction time was significantly less for both of the stapled reservoirs than for the HS pouch. Capacity of the AS pouch was significantly greater than the HS reservoir. This study suggests that stapling the ileal J-pouch through a single apical enterotomy should be the preferred technique during colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.\r"

The contents of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in adenocarcinomatous tissue (11.94 +/- 1.77 pmol/g wet wt) and colon polyps without focus of carcinoma (10.71 +/- 1.50 pmol/g wet wt) were found to be significantly higher than those in the mucosal layer (6.86 +/- 0.64 pmol/g wet wt) and muscle layer (8.30 +/- 0.68 pmol/g wet wt) of normal colon. These data suggest that the production of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity is specifically increased in some adenocarcinomas and adenomatous polyps and may be related to the alteration of bowel habits. Gel exclusion chromatography of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity revealed three peaks corresponding to beta-endorphin, beta-lipotropin, and an immunoreactive form between the two. In the mucosal layer and muscle layer of the colon, a broad major peak was eluted at the position of beta-endorphin, and minor peaks were eluted at the position of beta-lipotropin and between beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin. In adenocarcinoma and polyp, the peak size corresponding to authentic beta-lipotropin was greater than that of beta-endorphin. This study demonstrated that beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity existed at a high concentration in some colon adenocarcinomas and polyps whose elution patterns were different from those of normal colon tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and complications of esophageal tamponade as the first procedure in the routine management of acute variceal hemorrhage were evaluated in 151 consecutive bleeding episodes treated at a specialized unit. The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube was employed in the 118 cases in which emergency endoscopy demonstrated bleeding esophageal varices, and the Linton-Nachlas balloon in the 33 cases with bleeding from gastric varices. Hemostasis lasting at least 24 hr was obtained in 91.5% of cases treated with the Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon and in 88% of those treated with the Linton-Nachlas balloon. Permanent hemostasis was obtained in 47.7% of all cases. The only severe complication noted in these 151 episodes of bleeding treated by tamponade was pulmonary aspiration, which was detected in 10% of cases. This complication was related to the presence and degree of encephalopathy (P less than 0.001) and was prevented by orotracheal intubation prior to tamponade. These results indicate that balloon tamponade continues to be a reliable and valuable method to arrest bleeding from esophagogastric varices.\r"

  ".U": "88166337\r", 
  ".W": "In order to evaluate the diagnostic potential of liver ultrasonography (US), the charts of 23 cases with normal liver, 424 patients with chronic widespread, and 60 patients with focal hepatic diseases, who had undergone both US and liver biopsy, were reviewed. The positive predictive value of US was good in all hepatic disorders (range 86.9-96.5%), while its negative predictive value was very low (range 14.1-42.5%) in the various forms of widespread liver disease and suitable for screening purposes (74%) in focal lesions. Of the 507 cases, 39 with an ultrasonically suspected liver mass also underwent an echo-guided fine-needle aspiration, which showed a high sensitivity (85%) in the 27 biopsy-proved malignant lesions and excluded tumor cells in the remaining 12 cirrhotic cases. As regards US tissue diagnosis, hepatic tumors, fatty infiltration, and fibrosis were detected in 88%, 60%, and 49% of cases, respectively. Fat and fibrous content on biopsy were similarly and significantly correlated with both echo pattern and sound attenuation. Overall results suggest that in the group of widespread hepatic disorders the usefulness of US is greatly reduced by the fact that the patient's actual condition is not likely to be negative if US examination is normal and by the impossibility of differentiating fat from fibrosis. In focal lesions, the diagnostic value of US appears high and the method may frequently provide conclusive proof of the tumor if a positive cytodiagnosis on echo-guided aspirated material is done.\r"
