Preliminary data suggest that black uremic diabetics fare less well than whites following a kidney transplant. Planning treatment for the diabetic with progressive renal insufficiency requires an allowance for the high probability that coincident multisystem disease will develop. We now understand that the mysterious concept of unmanageable \"brittle diabetes\" was a myth derived from flawed interaction between patient and physician. By establishing a team approach, the patient is protected from the stress of having conflicting treatment protocols prescribed by physicians concerned with only one organ or system. Black diabetics who may often have less family income than whites may require more intensive support from social workers and diabetes educators to understand and cope with the burden of kidney failure. The majority of uremic diabetics, both black and white, can survive at least the first 3 years of dialysis or renal transplantation with preserved sight and intact limbs. It may be anticipated that the proportion of nephropathic diabetics who attain rehabilitation will continue to increase.\r"

Gonadal embryonal carcinoma developed in 1 child with Turner's syndrome (1 of 71). Four cases of nephroblastoma occurred, 1 in a child with MGD (1 of 18) and 3 in male pseudohermaphrodites (3 of 35). The nature of the defect linking male pseudohermaphroditism with Wilms tumor remains to be established.\r"

Discrimination analysis was performed in order to distinguish patients with new stone formation (non-responders) from those without stone recurrence (responders) during the treatment. The discriminant function classified 16 out of 18 responders as such and 5 non-responders as such by using a combination of the three initial variables urinary pH, 24-h urine volume and serum phosphate. Eighteen other analysed variables and patient factors did not contribute to this discrimination. By using \"leaving-one-out-technique\", the probability for erroneously classifying a patient increased from 9 to 17%. Applying the discriminant function on the group receiving placebo, 92% of these patients were classified as responders to thiazide. It is concluded that discrimination analysis may give valuable information in characterizing patients who will benefit from a special therapy.\r"

The effect of treatment on digital blood pressure during local cooling was assessed using the Nielsen-Lassen method. Symptomatic improvement was reported by 5 patients during placebo treatment and 17 during nifedipine treatment (p less than 0.01). The symptomatic improvement was significant in the total group of patients and in the group of patients with idiopathic vasospastic disease. The digital blood pressure during local cooling improved significantly with nifedipine at 5, 10, 15 (p less than 0.001) and 20 degrees C (p less than 0.05) for the total study population and for the two subgroups except for the change at 20 degrees C in the IDIOP group. At a digital temperature of 10 degrees C, 2 patients reached normal digital blood pressure during placebo treatment compared to 16 during nifedipine treatment (p less than 0.001). The number of side-effects increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during nifedipine treatment. We consider the use of nifedipine in patients with cold-induced digital vasospastic disease to be of great value, especially in patients with digital vasospastic disease of idiopathic origin.\r"

The double-dummy technique was employed. Endoscopy was performed after 4 weeks treatment and, if the ulcer had not healed, after 8 weeks treatment. When ulcer healing had occurred, the patient entered a 1 year follow-up study. The cumulative healing rates after 4 and 8 weeks treatment were 83 and 97% vs. 69 and 94% in the antacid and cimetidine groups respectively. No significant differences were observed between the treatment groups regarding ulcer healing, symptom relief or compliance. Adverse reactions were few and only 3 (9%) patients in the antacid group had to discontinue the treatment due to diarrhoea. Of the cimetidine treated patients, 61% had symptomatic relapse during the 1 year follow-up compared to 71% of the antacid treated patients. There were no significant differences in recurrence rate or time to relapse. The moderate dose antacid treatment used here is efficient, well tolerated, safe, convenient and is a good alternative treatment of the duodenal ulcer patient.\r"

Digital subtraction angiograms were acquired on a 512 X 512 X 8 bit pixel matrix at 8 frames/second. Fifteen segments from nine human cadaver coronary arteries, with lesions ranging from 0% to 97%, were analyzed. Hand injections of radiopaque dye were made during the pulsatile infusion of saline solution at physiologic pressures and flows. Individual frames best demonstrating a lesion were digitally magnified and the stenosis was measured; the operator identified only the segment of interest. The artery was then injected with a rapidly hardening gel during the same rate of infusion as that used during image acquisition. Histologic sections were cut at 2 mm intervals after fixation and elastic stains applied. Photographs of the section comparable to the site determined from the angiogram were taken, and hand planimetry by a blinded investigator was performed. There was an excellent correlation between histopathology and videodensitometry (r = 0.93; p less than 0.0001). The two geometric algorithms studied also had very good correlations (r = 0.90 and 0.84) with pathology. Two experienced angiographers, despite excellent agreement with each other, had lower correlations with pathology than any of the three computer algorithms studied (r = 0.79 and 0.83, respectively), although this difference did not attain statistical significance. This in vitro model simulating in vivo conditions validates the use of automated videodensitometric and geometric computer algorithms to interpret coronary angiography and assess severity of stenosis.\r"

Both methods were tested against valve area data from catheterization performed within 24 hours after Doppler echocardiography. Ten readers analyzed each of 10 Doppler profiles by methods A and B, in random order. After decoding, each of the 200 Doppler readings was compared to the catheterization result. Method B proved more accurate than method A by repeated measures analysis of variance (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, method B took less than half as long to perform (p less than 0.0001). The methods presented herein provide a simple alternative means to follow the progression of mitral stenosis noninvasively and to determine optimal timing for surgery.\r"

Additionally, we sought to determine if mean and peak velocity recorded from the descending aorta (DAo) were similar to velocities in the AAo. Twenty-eight consecutive individuals who had normal hearts were studied. AAo velocities were measured with four transducers including a nonimaging device that transmitted Doppler at right angles to the transducer handle, a 30-degree angled continuous wave transducer, an imaging transducer that transmitted Doppler in line with the transducer handle, and a second imaging transducer that sectored at 25 degrees to the transducer handle. DAo was studied with a standard in-line imaging transducer. Results showed that mean and peak AAo velocities recorded by transducers that transmitted off the axis of the transducer handle were similar, but the transducer that imaged along the transducer handle axis produced significantly lower peak and mean velocities. The problem that caused lower velocity for the on-axis transducer was inability to image the area immediately posterior to the sternum to permit alignment in the azimuthal dimension. The continuous wave transducer provided a wide spectral dispersion. Mean DAo velocity was similar to mean AAo velocity, but variability was large.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine which of these indices of LV performance relates best to the extent of LV ischemic mass at risk. Studies were performed in 24 open-chest anesthetized dogs. Acute ischemia was produced by occlusion of various levels of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. LV ischemic mass, measured as a percent of total LV mass, was delineated by injection of Evans blue dye into the nonischemic zone. Acc and Vel were measured with continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. EF was measured angiographically. All parameters were measured during a control period and within 6 minutes of coronary occlusion. The percent change during ischemia of each parameter relative to control (% delta) was calculated. The correlation coefficient between the percent ischemic mass at risk and % delta Acc was 0.88. It was 0.84 for % delta EF, 0.77 for % delta Vel, and 0.17 for % delta SV. These results indicate that among the various global indices of LV performance that have been used noninvasively, Acc correlates most closely with the extent of LV ischemic mass at risk.\r"

Reduced oral glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemic responses to both oral glucose challenge and to a glucose infusion test were present in a substantial number of the young patients. The very low density lipoprotein triglyceride concentration tended to rise progressively with increasing severity of glucose intolerance in both patients and control subjects. The magnitude of the early insulin response during the glucose infusion test, along with the high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, correlated inversely and independently with degree and extent of coronary atheromatosis, whereas the low density lipoprotein cholesterol level showed a positive correlation with severity of coronary atheromatosis. The present data argue against the concept of direct atherogenic action of high plasma insulin levels. In contrast, a low and delayed early insulin response might be a marker of enhanced liability to evolution of severe diffuse coronary atheromatosis.\r"

Considerable clinical data on C. pyloridis infections was available in older literature concerning gastritis and gastric urease. C. pyloridis causes a form of type B gastritis. In some individuals the acute infection is associated with abdominal pain and transient hypochlorhydria. C. pyloridis infection is difficult to eradicate with current therapies. The mechanisms by which C. pyloridis infection may lead to development of peptic ulcers, nonulcer dyspepsia, or atrophic gastritis are discussed. Recent technological advances, such as the 13C-urea breath test, provide rapid noninvasive methods of identifying active C. pyloridis infection. These methods will permit the rapid execution of definitive investigations of the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and possible reservoirs of C. pyloridis infection and will delineate the spectrum of C. pyloridis-associated disorders.\r"

Tissue-specific genes are usually in the late-replicating G-bands and therein almost always replicate late. Within the G-bands, however, a tissue-specific gene does replicate early in those cell types that express that particular gene. While the condition of late replication may simply be coincident with gene repression, we review evidence suggesting that late replication may actively determine repression. As mammals utilize a developmental program to Lyonize (facultatively heterochromatinize) whole X chromosomes to a late-replicating and somatically heritable repressed state, similarly another program seems to Lyonize individual replicons. In frogs, all genes begin embryogenesis by replicating during a very short interval. As the developmental potency of embryonic cells becomes restricted, late-replicating DNA gradually appears. This addition to the repertoire of gene control--i.e., repression via Lyonization of individual replicons--seems to have evolved in vertebrates with G-bands being a manifestation of the mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Although there is much circumstantial and some direct clinical evidence suggesting that a high consumption of salt predisposes patients to the development of essential hypertension, the mechanism by which such consumption causes high blood pressure is not clear. It has been suggested that due to an inherited abnormality in renal sodium excretion, high salt intake triggers an increase in the levels of sodium transport inhibitor. Although this may help to restore sodium balance, it may also increase the concentration of intracellular sodium in arteriolar smooth muscle and, thereby, stimulate smooth muscle reactivity. It has been shown that intra-arterial infusion of calcium channel blockers into the forearm produces an enhancement of forearm blood flow that is proportional to the degree of hypertension. Other studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between the degree of hypertension and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction following treatment with a calcium channel blocker. These clinical findings, combined with evidence from studies in animals, suggest that a functionally abnormal response of smooth muscle cells to calcium channel blockers occurs as blood pressure increases. Whether this functional abnormality is related to an increased level of intracellular calcium and/or inhibition of the sodium pump is not known. The short-term blood pressure lowering effect of nifedipine appears to be enhanced when sodium intake is increased.\r"

  ".W": "Although the cardiovascular actions of calcium antagonists have been studied extensively, it is only recently that attention has focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function. Variable actions of calcium antagonists on renal hemodynamics have been observed when these agents are used in experimental animal models. In contrast, when administered in vitro to the isolated perfused kidney, calcium antagonists demonstrate more predictable actions. Calcium antagonists do not affect the vasodilated isolated kidney, but they do dramatically alter the response of the kidney to vasoconstrictor agents. In the presence of norepinephrine, calcium antagonists produce a modest improvement in renal perfusion and significantly augment glomerular filtration rate. This preferential augmentation of glomerular filtration rate may be attributable to a selective vasodilation of pre-glomerular vessels. Although the clinical implications of such observations are not yet clear, preliminary studies indicate that calcium antagonists may exert salutary effects on renal function in clinical settings that are characterized by impaired renal hemodynamics. The possible benefits of calcium antagonists in ameliorating the development of renal dysfunction in patients in whom there is increased risk for the development of acute renal insufficiency remain to be evaluated.\r"

Since calcium is involved in these and other events, considerable data exist on the effects of altering calcium influx in experimental atherosclerosis. Interventions that increase calcium deposition tend to increase the severity of experimental atherosclerosis, whereas interventions that reduce calcium entry into cells tend to reduce its progression. Using rabbits, researchers have recently focused on the ability of calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, to attenuate the development of experimental atherosclerosis. Studies also suggest that although calcium channel blockers may protect against the development of experimental atherosclerosis, they are less effective in inducing its regression. Further, studies with calcium channel blockers in rabbits deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptors did not show protection against the development of atherosclerosis. However, no clinical studies are yet available to judge the potential protective effects of calcium channel blockers in humans. Since many patients are now receiving long-term calcium blocker therapy for hypertension, these findings may be relevant in the selection of antihypertensive therapy, provided that protective effects can be demonstrated.\r"

The changes in cytoplasmic ionized calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]) that occur during a contraction-relaxation cycle of vascular smooth muscle are reviewed, as is recent evidence indicating that vascular smooth muscle tone can be increased by increasing the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium without a necessary change in [Ca2+]i levels. Data obtained using intracellular calcium indicators suggest that agonists that produce similar force profiles often produce very different profiles in [Ca2+]i. The amount of force produced at a specific level of [Ca2+]i is a variable of intact vascular smooth muscle, i.e., some agonists produce sizable tonic contractions with little elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca2+], whereas other agonists require much larger increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] to produce comparable increases in tone. These data also indicate that very small changes in [Ca2+]i can cause large changes in vascular tone. Designing therapeutic agents that would decrease [Ca2+]i or decrease the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to ionized calcium would directly decrease intrinsic myogenic tone. Although a causative role for abnormal [Ca2+]i in the etiology of hypertension is controversial, it is obvious that a decrease in these levels in the vascular smooth muscle cell could be therapeutically beneficial.\r"

Case-control studies may give accurate survival estimates, but to be valid, selection biases must be taken into account. A matched case-control method was used to compare survival patterns in patients treated medically or surgically during the 1980s. Fifty medical patients with potentially operable coronary disease and 46 surgical patients were matched for significant three-vessel disease and abnormal ventricular function. These two groups had no significant differences with regard to 24 variables, including age (64 +/- 8 versus 63 +/- 10 years), chest pain class, congestive heart failure signs, ejection fraction (36 +/- 8 versus 37 +/- 9 percent), segmental wall score, or a coronary score evaluating lesion site and severity. There were slight differences between the two groups with regard to congestive heart failure symptoms (p = 0.04). Patients undergoing bypass surgery had improved four-year survival rates compared with the medical group (89 versus 55 percent; p = 0.01). Thus, this study used an effective case-control method to suggest that, in the 1980s, coronary surgery improves prognosis substantially in surgically approachable patients with severe coronary disease and ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Runners had less physical disability than age-matched control subjects (p less than 0.01) and maintained more functional capacity (p less than 0.001) as measured by a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index. Runners sought medical services less often, but one third of the visits that they did make were for running-related injuries. No differences were found between groups in conditions thought to predispose to osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disability. Ligamentous laxity and family history of arthritis were similar in both groups. Runners demonstrated better cardiovascular fitness and weighed less. Differences persisted after adjustment for age, occupation, and sex, and after inclusion or exclusion of subjects with major medical problems. Musculoskeletal disability appeared to develop with age at a lower rate in runners (0.003 units per year versus 0.028) than in community control subjects, and the decreased rate was observed with both lower extremity and upper extremity functions. These data suggest positive effects of systematic aerobic running activity upon functional aspects of musculoskeletal aging.\r"

Definitive guidelines concerning proper patient selection for prophylaxis against duodenal ulcer recurrence are lacking. Persons likely to benefit from maintenance therapy include those who smoke and those with a long duration of symptoms or prior history of an ulcer complication. Although not an approved indication, maintenance therapy to prevent recurrent gastric ulcer is appropriate for elderly persons receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or in patients with poor cardiopulmonary status who may not tolerate surgery for an ulcer-related complication. The role of long-term H2-antagonist therapy in reflux esophagitis is not defined but may be appropriate in scleroderma and Barrett's esophagus. Finally, several miscellaneous conditions, including cystic fibrosis, Menetrier's disease, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, may benefit from long-term H2-antagonist therapy. Currently, clinical trials document the efficacy of maintenance therapy in duodenal ulcer for up to a three-year period; however, for gastric ulcer and chronic reflux esophagitis, the duration and benefit of long-term therapy is not established, and treatment regimens need to be individualized. Therapy may be required indefinitely in the miscellaneous states mentioned previously.\r"

Review of the literature revealed 14 prior cases of balloon dilatation of the hepatic venous system: 10 of the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava, three of the right hepatic vein, and one of the left hepatic vein. Follow-up ranged from six months to 37 months. No serious complications were reported. All attempts at dilatation were successful, but reocclusion occurred in six patients, three of whom had occlusion of the hepatic vein. All but one patient with reocclusion, however, underwent repeated angioplasty, which was successful in all cases attempted. Two patients who had repeated angioplasty required no further therapy, but two patients required a total of three angioplasties and two patients required four angioplasties. Successful angioplasty was accompanied by resolution of clinical symptoms in all patients described. It is concluded that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is a safe and effective mode of therapy in the management of the Budd-Chiari syndrome due to membranous obstruction of the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava or the hepatic veins.\r"

Tf has specific membrane receptors on the surface of the cells that require iron. Tf-receptor binding is followed by internalization through a system of coated pits and vesicles. The rapid decline of pH of these vesicles leads to release and sequestration of iron by the cell. Apotransferrin-receptor complex returns to the cell surface, where, under neutral pH conditions, apotransferrin is dissociated. Other models for cellular uptake of iron include extraction of iron from Tf on the cell surface without internalization, uptake by adsorptive mechanism, and fluid-phase endocytosis. Recent advances in cellular and molecular biology, gene cloning, and monoclonal antibody technique have elucidated many features of these processes at a molecular level. These advances are reviewed and prospects for future work discussed.\r"

In the present studies, three maneuvers were performed: perfusion of the isolated, blood-drained rat liver with plasma containing ANRL and delivery of the plasma into the jugular vein of a hypertensive rat; injection of captopril, establishment of a RPS of a hypertensive rat (one-kidney, one-clip) followed by unclipping; and establishment of a RPS in a normal rat. The blood-drained liver was capable of decreasing significantly the lag period of ANRL. Captopril did not potentiate the antihypertensive action of the kidney when RPS was coupled with unclipping. Following the RPS, the BP of the normal rat dropped modestly over a 3-hour period. These results further support the concept of reno-hepatic axis of BP control.\r"

The improved distance visual acuity observed in the ketorolac treatment group (8/13 patients) was statistically different from the improved vision observed in the placebo treated group (1/13 patients) (P = .005). No patient on a regimen of ketorolac therapy had a significant decrease in Snellen distance visual acuity while on treatment, but two patients in the placebo group demonstrated a decrease in visual acuity of two lines or more. Fluorescein angiography was consistent with changes in visual acuity.\r"

Intraocular pressure, pupil size, and anterior chamber cellular reaction were measured in a masked fashion on the first day after surgery. A significant increase in intraocular pressure was found in all groups postoperatively when compared with baseline values (P less than .001). Eyes treated with pilocarpine gel had an average intraocular pressure increase of 4.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 S.E.), eyes treated with pilocarpine 4% eyedrops had an average increase of 9.8 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, and eyes treated with timolol demonstrated an intraocular pressure increase of 8.25 +/- 3.19. The intraocular pressure in untreated eyes (controls) increased by an average of 12.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg. Only the difference in intraocular pressure change between the eyes treated with pilocarpine gel and control eyes was statistically significant (P = .025). Postsurgical intraocular pressure exceeding 25 mm Hg was observed in three of 20 pilocarpine gel treated eyes (15%) and 11 of 20 control eyes (55%). Pilocarpine treatment was not associated with noticeable changes in intraocular inflammatory response, nor were significant ocular or systemic adverse reactions observed. A single administration of pilocarpine gel is effective in reducing increased intraocular pressure for the first 24 hours after extracapsular cataract extraction.\r"

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, the authors determined the distribution of S in human renal tissue and its relationship to C5b-9, immunoglobulins, C3, albumin, and fibronectin. They examined normal and diseased human kidney tissue from patients with several forms of glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and arterionephrosclerosis. S and C5b-9 were found in all diseased tissues; their amounts and distribution directly correlated with severity and location of injury. S and C5b-9 were colocalized in all immune deposits and in all injured glomeruli, tubular basement membranes, and vessel walls. Other than within immune deposits, S and C5b-9 were usually not colocalized with C3. This study demonstrates that S is deposited in areas of tissue injury and thus may participate in the pathogenesis of renal damage. Because in tissue S and C5b-9 are always associated, the attack complex in tissue must either be derived from the circulation as SC5b-9 or it must be capable of binding S after the formation in situ of C5b-9.\r"

  ".W": "Mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive mutation \"viable motheaten\" (mev) are severely immunodeficient, show polyclonal B-cell activation, and express multiple autoantibodies over a maximum life span of 25 weeks. Lymphoid tissues from these mice contain large numbers of atypical plasma cells in which discrete glycoprotein inclusions are found within the endoplasmic reticulum. Such plasma cells are termed \"Mott cells,\" and the inclusions are called \"Russell bodies.\" Dense accumulations of Mott cells are present in the marginal zones of the spleen and in the lymph nodes of mev/mev mice. Russell bodies in Mott cells from mev/mev mice contain immunoglobulin (Ig) as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy at the light-microscopic level and by indirect protein A-immunogold localization at the electron-microscopic level. Ultrastructural analyses reveal the presence of amorphous, lamellar, and crystalline Russell bodies. These Ig crystals have a periodicity of 150-190 A. Lymph node cell preparations which were enriched in Mott cells by velocity sedimentation failed to secrete Ig in a polyclonal reverse plaque assay. An obligate role of the thymus in Mott cell development is evidenced by the absence of Mott cells in neonatally thymectomized mev/mev mice and in mice doubly homozygous for the nude (nu) and mev mutations. These data suggest that Mott cells in mev/mev mice are thymic-dependent plasmacytoid cells resulting from chronic B-cell activation accompanied by impaired Ig secretion.\r"

Limited available data suggest that the mainly schizophrenic subtype has a poorer prognosis and includes cases more closely related to schizophrenia. Schizoaffective mania also overlaps with proposed categories such as reactive and cycloid psychosis. It is premature to assume that all schizoaffective manic disorder represents a bipolar variant. Further studies that differentiate patients according to subtype, drug response, and course are needed.\r"

Intestinalization of the fragment resulted in the survival of eight of nine animals (89 percent) in which recovery was uneventful, whereas animals with pancreatitis in situ or in a mobilized fragment without intestinalization had a mortality rate of 100 percent within 2 days. We conclude that intestinalization ameliorates the outcome of hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the pancreatic fragment by effectively draining toxic products. The procedure may also be useful in pancreatic transplantation since no reintervention is necessary if graft failure or rejection occurs because the pancreas is accessible by endoscopy.\r"

  ".W": "Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are major structural components of the brain and through their effects on membrane properties can influence nerve conduction, transmitter release, and transmitter action. Prostaglandins (PGs) derived from EFAs have profound behavioral effects and are also able to modify conduction and transmitter function. Effects of alcohol on EFAs and PGs are therefore good candidates for explaining at least some of the actions of alcohol on brain function. Ethanol has three main known actions on EFA and PG metabolism: it reduces blood linoleic acid levels and induces or exaggerates EFA deficiency states; it blocks metabolism of linoleic acid to EFA metabolites which are known to be important in brain structure; and it enhances conversion of the linoleic acid metabolite, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, to PGE1. This review demonstrates that some of the short-term behavioral effects of ethanol and some of its long-term adverse effects on brain, liver, and other tissues may be partly explicable in terms of ethanol actions on EFA and PG metabolism. Modification of such metabolism by dietary and other means has already been shown to influence the effects of alcohol and alcohol withdrawal in both humans and animals. This promises to be a fruitful source of investigation with substantial implications for the understanding and treatment of alcoholism.\r"

All measurements, birth weight, length and head circumference were below -2 SD. All had congenital heart disease. Chromosome analysis confirmed 21 trisomy in every case. Down syndrome and FAS may occur together, at random, in 1 in 525,0000 newborns in United States but 1 in 200,000 in our institution. Estimated incidence of FAS and Down syndrome in our institution was 1 in 6,600, a 30-fold increase over the chance occurrence of these two conditions together. Mean age of mothers at delivery was 29.6 +/- 9.3, statistically similar to the mean ages of mothers who delivered Down syndrome and FAS babies in our two hospitals, but was significantly higher than the mean age of mothers in our general population (p less than 0.001). All study cases had chronic alcoholic mothers as well as maternal grandmothers, suggesting that there is an increased incidence of trisomy 21 in children of second generation of alcoholic mothers.\r"

HBV-positive and negative HCC patients were further subdivided into four subgroups based on the history of drinking more than one small bottle of Japanese \"sake\" or its equivalent per day for more than 10 yr and the history of smoking more than one cigarette per day for more than 10 yr. Among HBV-positive HCC patients, the average age of those with a drinking and a smoking habit (50 +/- 10 yr) was younger compared with that of patients with a drinking habit but without a smoking habit (56 +/- 14 yr, not significant, NS), of those who were smokers and nondrinkers (55 +/- 10 yr, NS) and of those who did not drink nor smoke (59 +/- 8 yr, p less than 0.005).

Abnormal chemoreceptor function is therefore unlikely to be an important factor in the development of abnormal respiratory events during sleep in abstinent alcoholic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The reinforcing properties and subjective effects of alcohol were assessed in 29 normal volunteers using a seven-session choice procedure. On the first four sessions, subjects sampled an alcohol (0.5 g/kg) and a placebo beverage twice each. On three subsequent choice sessions, subjects chose the drink they preferred. The number of times they chose alcohol was the measure of its reinforcing properties. On all sessions subjects completed mood questionnaires before and several times after consuming the beverage. Other dependent measures during the experiment included a cognitive performance task, drug liking and identification questionnaires, and breathalyzer alcohol determinations. Demographic and personality data also were obtained. Approximately one-third of the subjects chose the alcohol-containing beverage on all three choice sessions, one-third alternated in their choices of alcohol and placebo, and one-third consistently chose the placebo. When the subjective effects of alcohol (determined during sampling sessions) were compared across the three choice groups, qualitative differences in response to alcohol were observed. For example, alcohol increased elation and vigor scores in the consistent choosers of alcohol, whereas it decreased scores on these measures in the consistent placebo choosers. Consistent alcohol choosers did not differ from placebo choosers in gender or age but they reported more marijuana use and slightly more alcohol use outside the laboratory. They also scored higher on certain measures of arousal and depression, on the Sensation Seeking Scale and on the Psychopathic State Inventory. The results are discussed in terms of individual differences in vulnerability to excessive use of alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "Human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) exists in multiple molecular forms. Two different isoenzymes of ALDH have been purified which will oxidize acetaldehyde to acetate. ALDH1 is localized principally in hepatocyte cytosol and exhibits a Km for acetaldehyde of about 0.1 mM at pH 9.5. ALDH2 is mitochondrial in origin and exhibits low Km for acetaldehyde, about 1 microM. We have developed rapid purification procedures for ALDH1 and ALDH2 by use of agarose-AMP affinity chromatography and high-performance anion-exchange liquid chromatography (HPLC). The method takes less time and affords higher yields of the labile ALDH isoenzymes than conventional column chromatography methods. A previously uncharacterized ALDH form has been identified by anion-exchange HPLC which exhibits high Km for acetaldehyde, about 1 mM, and is very labile. Polyclonal antibodies to the purified ALDH1 and ALDH2 isoenzymes have been prepared. As evidenced by immunoblotting of starch gels containing the purified isoenzymes, anti-ALDH1 does not crossreact with ALDH2 and anti-ALDH2 does not crossreact with ALDH1. The anti-ALDH2 antibody identifies the \"inactive\" variant of ALDH2 in Japanese livers exhibiting the \"deficient\" ALDH2 phenotype. The sensitivity of detection of ALDH isoenzymes in liver homogenate-supernatants by immunoblotting of starch gels is about 10-fold greater than that by activity staining.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic protein synthetic activity in vivo was measured by the incorporation of [3H]puromycin into elongating nascent polypeptides of rat liver to form peptidyl-[3H]puromycin. Our initial experiments showed that saturating doses of [3H]puromycin were achieved at 3-6 mumol/100 g body weight, and that maximum labeling of nascent polypeptides was obtained 30 min after injection of the labeled precursor. Labeled puromycin was found to be suitable for measuring changes in the status of protein synthesis, since the formation of the peptidyl-[3H]puromycin was decreased in fasted animals and was increased in rats pretreated with L-tryptophan. [3H]Puromycin incorporation into polypeptides was then measured after acute ethanol administration as well as after prolonged consumption of ethanol which was administered as part of a liquid diet for 31 days. Acute alcohol treatment caused no significant change in [3H]puromycin incorporation into liver polypeptides. In rats exposed to chronic ethanol feeding, peptidyl-[3H]puromycin formation, when expressed per mg of protein, was slightly lower compared to pair-fed controls, but was unchanged compared to chow-fed animals. When the data were expressed per mg of DNA or per 100 g body wt, no differences in protein synthetic activity were observed among the three groups. These findings indicate that neither acute nor chronic alcohol administration significantly affects protein synthetic activity in rat liver. They further suggest that accumulation of protein in the liver, usually seen after prolonged ethanol consumption, is apparently not reflected by an alteration of hepatic protein synthesis.\r"

To test this hypothesis, EFA profiles in blood-lipid fractions, serum liver enzymes, cognitive function, and alcohol craving were measured in 27 acutely abstinent alcoholics before and after a 3-week double-blind trial of EFA supplementation. Upon entry into the study, alcoholics had significant differences in EFA levels as compared to normal controls, and serum levels of liver enzymes tended to correlate with these EFA levels. After 21 days, cognitive function, alcohol craving, and liver enzymes all improved in both the EFA and placebo groups; most EFA levels also approached normal values. There were no treatment effects of EFA supplementation at the dose used.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal injections of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and guanfacine in rats was determined to establish their dose-response curves. Spinal cord tissue concentrations were also determined in a separate group of animals. Guanfacine was found to be more potent than clonidine and had a considerably longer duration of action. Thus, whereas the analgesic effect of clonidine declined to baseline by 4 hr after injecting doses of up to 50 micrograms, guanfacine still showed a considerable effect 18 hr after injecting both 25 and 50 micrograms. With both compounds, concentration gradients existed within the spinal cord. In the experiments with guanfacine, the region in the spinal cord tissue with the highest concentrations 10 min after injection contained around 30 pmol/mg wet weight. At 3 hr, this figure was around 20 pmol/mg. With clonidine, on the other hand, the concentration decreased from the maximal level of 200 pmol/mg at 10 min to 10 pmol/mg at 3 hr. On all occasions, except 10 min after injecting clonidine, it was found that the maximal tissue concentrations for both drugs remained below the cervical spinal cord, i.e., the rostral spread was less than expected, especially with drugs with such a long duration of action. The present investigation demonstrates analgesic effects of both clonidine and guanfacine after intrathecal administration, with guanfacine proving more potent and longer acting; the difference in duration of action is probably attributable to differences in rates of elimination of the drugs from spinal cord tissue.\r"

The final index selected for testing contained information on a history of \"asthma,\" \"wheeze,\" \"episodes of cough with sputum,\" and \"pneumonia.\" It had a sensitivity ranging from 5% to 67% and positive predictive value from 67% to 28% depending on the cutoff point chosen as indicative of increased airway reactivity.

We administered aerosols of HCl and H2SO4 at pH 2.0 in an unbuffered state and buffered with glycine. The buffered acids were given in order of increasing titratable acidity (defined as the number of ml of 1 N NaOH required to neutralize 100 ml of acid solution to pH 7.0). Each set of buffered or unbuffered acid aerosols was given on a separate day and each aerosol was inhaled through a mouthpiece during 3 min of tidal breathing. Bronchoconstriction was assessed by measurement of specific airway resistance (SRaw) before and after inhalation of each aerosol. SRaw increased by more than 50% above baseline in 1 of 8 subjects after inhalation of unbuffered HCl and in no subjects after inhalation of unbuffered H2SO4, even at pH 2.0. In contrast, SRaw increased by greater than 50% in all 8 subjects after inhalation of HCl and glycine at pH 2.0 and 7 of 8 subjects after inhalation of H2SO4 and glycine at pH 2.0. The mean titratable acidity required to increase SRaw by 50% above baseline was calculated for each challenge by linear interpolation; these values for H2SO4 and glycine (5.1 ml of 1 N NaOH) and HCl and glycine (2.2 ml of 1 N NaOH) were slightly, but significantly, different (p = 0.01) and were considerably higher than the titratable acidity of the unbuffered acids at pH 2 (1.0 ml of 1 N NaOH).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Airway responsiveness to methacholine aerosol decreased 2- to 3-fold within 8 wk of SO2 exposure. In contrast, airway responsiveness to intravenous administration of methacholine did not change. The data suggest that the decreased airway responsiveness observed during persistent pulmonary inflammation in SO2-exposed dogs is not due to an altered state of airway contractile elements but likely reflects expression of an inhibitory influence of the mucoepithelial barrier.\r"

Design: Nonrandomized, nonconcurrent cohort study. Setting: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, conducted in 68 institutions in North America. Patients: Women were included if they had breast cancer with positive nodes and were aged 49 years or less with both estrogen and progesterone receptor levels of 10 fmol or more, aged 50 to 59 years with progesterone receptor levels of 10 fmol or more, or aged 60 to 69 years. Two cohorts were compared: patients who were randomly assigned to the tamoxifen arm of the adjuvant chemotherapy trial (randomized patients) and women who were added to this arm after randomization had ceased (registered patients). Three hundred seventy-seven women in each group who were disease free at the end of the initial 2-year treatment period were followed for an additional 3 years. Interventions: All received melphalan, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily by mouth) for 2 years. Registered patients (but not randomized patients) were offered tamoxifen for a third year after the initial 2-year treatment period, and 273 (72%) agreed. Measurements and Main Results: Women receiving a third year of tamoxifen had a better disease-free survival rate (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 2.07; p = 0.004) and survival rate (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% Cl, 1.02 to 2.37; p = 0.04) through their fifth postoperative year. Women aged 50 years or more benefited, but those aged 49 years or less did not. Conclusions: The benefit of tamoxifen given to tamoxifen-responsive patients in conjunction with melphalan and fluorouracil appears to be enhanced when the tamoxifen treatment is continued beyond cessation of treatment with these agents.\r"

Design: Randomized trial with a median follow-up of 57 months. Setting: A single government institution--the National Cancer Institute. Patients: Consecutive sample of 96 patients with histologically confirmed small cell lung cancer that was confined to the hemithorax of origin or mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, and which could be encompassed within a tolerable radiation portal (\"limited stage\"). All patients were followed until death or the end of the study period. Interventions: Chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and lomustine in 6-week cycles alternating with vincristine, adriamycin, and procarbazine in 6-week cycles, for a total of 48 weeks. Radiation therapy: Chest irradiation to 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks, given simultaneously with the first chemotherapy cycle. Measurements and Main Results: The combined therapy led to a significantly higher response rate (complete responses, 81%, compared with partial responses, 43%; 95% Cl for the difference, 20% to 56%), significantly improved local control of the chest tumor (p less than 0.001), and significantly longer survival (p less than 0.035) (median, 15.0 months, compared with 11.6 for chemotherapy alone). The combined therapy produced significantly more myelosuppression, weight loss, esophagitis, and pulmonary dysfunction. There were more infections and deaths from toxicity in the combined treatment group, but the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion: A regimen of combined chemotherapy and chest radiation therapy given concurrently is superior to chemotherapy given alone in inducing remission and prolonging survival in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer, and the benefit of combined therapy is reduced by its greater toxicity.\r"

Over a 3-month period, 2707 consecutive serum samples referred for confirmatory testing for human T-lymphotrophic virus type III (HTLV-III) antibodies were evaluated by both Western blot and CBre3-EIA. On a single determination for each sample, the CBre3-EIA was found to have an estimated sensitivity (99.9%) and specificity (99.1%) similar or superior to the more cumbersome Western blot method. This study shows that all HIV-seropositive subjects have antibodies to the virus envelope protein; no other virus antigens are required for construction of highly sensitive immunoassays.\r"

We reviewed vitamin B12 assays on 1599 consecutive patients and prospectively studied all patients with low serum B12 levels (n = 75) and a random sample of patients with normal levels (n = 68). Of 96 evaluable patients, 7 had clinical deficiency. All 7 deficient patients had urinary methylmalonic acid levels greater than 5 micrograms/mg creatine (sensitivity, 100%; confidence interval, 65% to 100%). Of the 89 patients who were not clinically deficient, 88 had urinary methylmalonic acid levels less than or equal to 5 micrograms/mg creatinine (specificity, 99%). The overall test accuracy in this population was 99%. If the high sensitivity and specificity of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for urinary methylmalonic acid is supported by other clinical studies, the methylmalonic acid assay may become the reference standard for the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.\r"

These drugs act at sequential steps to inhibit the formation of tetrahydrofolate in the parasite. Recently, their use for malaria prophylaxis has been associated with severe, at times fatal, cutaneous reactions including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. These reactions have necessitated a major reassessment of the indications for pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine use and increased the search for pharmacologic, immunologic and behavioral approaches to the prophylaxis and treatment of infection with P. falciparum. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine may be effective in preventing recurrent pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, but life-threatening cutaneous reactions have also been reported in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "Kidney transplantation using either kidneys from living or nonliving donors is now generally regarded as the primary therapy for most patients with end-stage kidney failure. In 1984, 32% of all kidney transplantations done in the United States involved living donors. Reasons justifying the use of kidneys from living donors are the higher success rate and the inadequate supply of cadaveric kidneys. In addition, with a living donor, it is easier to arrange for kidney transplantation before dialysis therapy needs to be started. An analysis of 2495 donor nephrectomies reported in the literature, and 5698 donor nephrectomies reported from the 12 largest centers that do kidney transplantation with living donors, indicates an approximate incidence of 1 donor death per 1600 nephrectomies. Although long-term follow-up in kidney donors has shown only that mild, nonprogressive proteinuria develops in about 33% and that the frequency of hypertension may increase, we advise that the kidney donor have a careful long-term follow-up and avoid a high protein intake because of its potential to lead to progressive glomerular damage.\r"

With declining mortality and morbidity from infections, and the advent of major antimicrobial drugs, interest in infectious disease flagged in clinical and microbiological departments. Several factors have caused a new interest in infectious disease, including the appearance of newly recognized infectious disease syndromes; advances in microbiologic, immunologic, virologic, and epidemiologic understanding; increased societal interest; proliferation of effective therapeutic and preventive agents; and the general thrust toward specialization. This interest led to the formation of societies, subspecialty boards, and journals, and accounts for the prominence of infectious disease in clinical departments and in national thought. Similar developments are taking place at various rates in other countries, with renewed attention to the toll of infectious diseases in developing countries.\r"

There has been dispute over the relative effectiveness of different approaches. This study was undertaken to compare direct nerve implantation with the transfer of a neuromuscular pedicle using denervated strap muscles in a rabbit model. Reinnervation was carried out both immediately after denervation and after a delay period. Evidence of return of function was obtained by a method of long-term electromyographic monitoring and was confirmed electrically by evoked electromyography and muscle tension measurement and histologically by brain stem uptake of horseradish peroxidase. Both methods of nerve transfer produced consistently functional neuromuscular units, with physiological activity and muscle strength comparable with those in normally innervated controls. Return of function was apparent within 6 weeks of both nerve implantation and neuromuscular transfer; with this model, neither method showed a clear advantage over the other.\r"

After approximately 1 year of alpha-IFN treatment, five patients were clear, and the rest continued to have disease: seven mild, two moderate, and two severe. A second course of alpha-IFN was administered to eight patients, all of whom had a decrease in the volume of the papilloma. The reduction in anatomic distribution was variable. During the observation period all patients either cleared (50%), improved (25%), or continued with severe disease (25%). In summary, the response of recurrent respiratory papilloma to alpha-IFN therapy is dramatic in some patients and slight in others.\r"

There are multiple techniques available for reconstruction of the subglottic larynx, but most of them have a high rate of complications or graft failure. We have found the sternocleidomastoid myoperiosteal flap to be an ideal means of reconstruction. In an experimental study, we performed subglottic reconstruction using the sternomastoid myoperiosteal flap on 15 mongrel dogs to determine the presence of bone formation versus calcified fibrous scar. Radiologic studies suggested apparent metaplastic bone formation at the graft site, and histologic studies confirmed this. Functionally, 12 dogs had stable airways without stridor or subglottic narrowing. Three dogs died of complications. With successful reconstruction of large defects in the canine subglottis, attempts to repair large subglottic and tracheal defects in the human are feasible.\r"

The prosthesis was passed through the round window membrane in one ear. In the other the prosthesis bypassed the round window via an opening anteroinferior to the round window niche. Before death, horseradish peroxidase was administered as a tracer for possible pathways of infection. Results showed that group A streptococci were pathogenic to the cat and caused inflammation in the bulla. The unimplanted round window membrane and the seals around the electrode entry points prevented infection from entering the cochlea. The seals around electrodes inserted either through the round window membrane or an opening drilled anteroinferior to the niche were equally effective. The horseradish peroxidase tracer studies showed, however, that a gap existed between the electrode and membranous seal, and this could be a potentially vulnerable site under certain conditions. Drilling an anteroinferior opening into the cochlea resulted in bony sequestra entering the cochlea. This can be avoided by blue-lining the opening and removing bone with picks before making an opening through the endosteum.\r"

The appearance of antiviral activity depends on active milk lipases and correlates with the release of free fatty acids in the milk. A number of fatty acids which are normal components of milk lipids were tested against enveloped viruses, i.e., vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus, and visna virus, and against a nonenveloped virus, poliovirus. Short-chain and long-chain saturated fatty acids had no or a very small antiviral effect at the highest concentrations tested. Medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, on the other hand, were all highly active against the enveloped viruses, although the fatty acid concentration required for maximum viral inactivation varied by as much as 20-fold. Monoglycerides of these fatty acids were also highly antiviral, in some instances at a concentration 10 times lower than that of the free fatty acids. None of the fatty acids inactivated poliovirus. Antiviral fatty acids were found to affect the viral envelope, causing leakage and at higher concentrations, a complete disintegration of the envelope and the viral particles. They also caused disintegration of the plasma membranes of tissue culture cells resulting in cell lysis and death. The same phenomenon occurred in cell cultures incubated with stored antiviral human milk. The antimicrobial effect of human milk lipids in vitro is therefore most likely caused by disintegration of cellular and viral membranes by fatty acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the studies reported here, we examined the inoculum effect observed with chloroquine and Plasmodium falciparum. The 50% effective doses observed with both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant parasites increased five- to sevenfold from their baseline values as the inoculum was increased from 2 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(7) parasitized erythrocytes per ml (parasitemias of 0.1 to 10% with a hematocrit of 2%). Increasing the inoculum also decreased the chloroquine uptake per parasitized erythrocyte 15- to 20-fold with both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant parasites. However, because of the 100-fold increase in the inoculum, the total amount of chloroquine taken up actually increased sufficiently to reduce the extracellular chloroquine concentration in vitro by 60 to 90%. These studies suggest that a chloroquine uptake of greater than or equal to 2.0 pmol/10(6) parasitized erythrocytes is necessary for chloroquine to inhibit parasite growth. More marked reductions in the amount of chloroquine uptake per parasitized erythrocyte were observed with a hematocrit of 40% using similar parasitemias of 0.1 to 10% (inocula of 4 X 10(6) to 4 X 10(8) parasitized erythrocytes per ml). Thin-layer chromatography of [3H]chloroquine taken up by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum revealed no evidence of drug alteration by the parasite. These studies define the mechanism responsible for the inoculum effect observed with chloroquine and P. falciparum in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Eight antifungal agents were examined for effects on lipid biosynthesis and membrane integrity in Candida albicans. Lipids were labeled in vivo or in vitro with [14C]acetate and analyzed by thin-layer and gas chromatography. Membrane integrity was measured by a recently developed [14C]aminoisobutyric acid radiolabel release assay. The imidazole antifungal agents miconazole, econazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole, at concentrations inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis (0.1 microM), decreased the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in vivo but not in vitro. Similarly, naftifine, tolnaftate, and the azasterol A25822B, at concentrations inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis (10, 100, and 1 microM, respectively), decreased the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in vivo only. This suggests that the effect on fatty acids observed with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors may be secondary to the effect on ergosterol. With imidazoles, oleic acid antagonized inhibition of cell growth but not inhibition of ergosterol. This suggests that, with the C-14 demethylase inhibitors, decreased unsaturated fatty acids, rather than decreased ergosterol, are responsible for growth inhibition. Cerulenin, previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of both fatty acid and ergosterol biosynthesis, was found in the present study to inhibit the former (at 5 microM) but not the latter (up to 100 microM). Of the antifungal agents tested, econazole and miconazole (at 100 microM) produced complete release of [14C]aminoisobutyric acid, which is consistent with membrane damage.\r"

Fluconazole penetrated freely into both inflamed and uninflamed eyes. The presence of inflammation improved penetration of all three compounds into ocular fluids and tissues. Penetration of these azoles into the anterior chamber of uninflamed eyes and into the cerebrospinal fluid was similar. All three azole compounds reduced the number of yeasts found in the eye in hematogenous Candida albicans endophthalmitis in rabbits when therapy was initiated within 24 h of inoculation. However, only ketoconazole significantly reduced yeast counts in the eye when therapy was postponed for 7 days.\r"

All but one of the patients were Laotians. The intensity of clonorchiasis was light in 85% (63 of 74) and moderate in 15% (11 of 74) of the patients. Cure based on our established criteria was noted in 67 of 67 patients (100%) treated with praziquantel at a dose of 75 mg/kg per day. In contrast, four patients (20%) in the placebo group, each with light infection, ceased passing eggs and were, according to our established protocol, considered spontaneous cures (P less than 0.0001). Adverse effects of praziquantel were transient and included nausea and vomiting (15%), vertigo (12%), hepatomegaly (4.5%), headache (1.5%), rash (1.5%), and hypotension (1.5%). Of 20 patients who received placebo, 1 (5%) developed transient skin rash, fever, and chills. Clinically minor and transient, but statistically significant, changes in hemoglobin, total protein in serum, and levels of uric acid, cholesterol, and bilirubin in serum were noted. Results of this study showed that praziquantel is safe, well tolerated, and effective and should be considered as the drug of choice for treatment of clonorchiasis. In moderate infections, a second course of praziquantel therapy may be necessary to eliminate infection.\r"

  ".W": "Roxithromycin (RU 965), a new macrolide antibiotic, was shown to be effective for therapy of active syphilis in rabbits. Dark-field-positive lesions were produced in adult male rabbits by intradermal inoculation of approximately 10(6) Treponema pallidum organisms at each of 11 sites. Beginning 7 days after infection, six animals per group were treated with benzathine penicillin G (200,000 U, intramuscularly, weekly for 2 weeks) or roxithromycin (15 mg/kg of body weight, orally, twice daily for 15 days); six animals were not treated. Chancres in untreated animals were dark-field positive throughout the 16-day observation period; all benzathine penicillin-treated rabbits were dark-field negative 1 day after the initiation of therapy. Five of six animals treated with roxithromycin were dark-field negative on day 3 following the initiation of therapy; the sixth animal was dark-field negative by day 6. Lesions in untreated animals reached a mean (+/- standard deviation) maximum diameter of 14.7 +/- 1.91 mm compared with 8.4 +/- 3.6 mm for benzathine penicillin-treated (P less than 0.005) and 10.4 +/- 1.2 mm for roxithromycin-treated (P less than 0.001) animals. Ulceration occurred at 62 of 66 lesions in untreated animals compared with 0 of 66 lesions in each treated group. At 3, 6, and 12 weeks postinfection, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory antibody titers were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in untreated than in treated animals. Titers in penicillin-treated versus roxithromycin-treated animals were significantly different at 6 weeks postinfection but not at 3 and 12 weeks postinfection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87183436\r", 
  ".W": "In a prospective randomized study, ceftazidime monotherapy was compared with a combination of ceftazidime plus cephalothin in 102 febrile neutropenic patients. Thirty bacteriologically documented infections, of which 23 were bacteremias, in 48 clinically assessable patients were treated with ceftazidime alone. Twenty-four bacteriologically proven infections, of which 18 were bacteremias, in 42 clinically assessable patients were treated with a combination of ceftazidime and cephalothin. The clinical response rates in assessable patients were 77% for ceftazidime monotherapy and 88% for the combination. The bacteriological clearance rate was 70% for ceftazidime monotherapy and 79% for the combination. Efficacy against gram-negative pathogens appeared to be excellent, with 93% clearance for ceftazidime monotherapy and 100% clearance for the combination. The bacteriological clearance of gram-positive infections was only 60% for both regimens, with failures mainly due to Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis, which are primarily resistant to both ceftazidime and cephalothin. After addition of vancomycin to those infections which did not respond to empiric therapy, bacteriological clearance rates of 94% (ceftazidime plus vancomycin) and 90% (ceftazidime and cephalothin plus vancomycin) were achieved. Three superinfections were registered in the ceftazidime group and two were seen in the combination group. Other adverse effects of ceftazidime were minimal and were not enhanced by combination with cephalothin. It is concluded that ceftazidime is an effective drug for the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, especially if one is prepared to modify therapy if resistant gram-positive strains or mycotic infections are encountered. Neither the clinical nor bacteriological cure rates could be substantially improved by adding cephalothin to ceftazidime in initial empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.\r"

Comparison drugs such as amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor were less efficacious, especially in infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms. In localized infections, tigemonam also demonstrated excellent in vivo activity. In acute pyelonephritis in mice caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus sp., tigemonam was very effective. In a rat lung model with Klebsiella pneumoniae, tigemonam was active with a median effective dose of 46 mg/kg compared with 160 mg/kg for cefaclor and over 200 mg/kg for amoxicillin. Tigemonam was well absorbed in laboratory animals and with its excellent gram-negative spectrum of activity should prove of value in oral antibiotic therapy in humans.\r"

Electron spin resonance spectra indicated that increasing concentrations of cations competitively displaced probe from LPS aggregates. Polymyxin B and other cations displaced less probe from LPS of polymyxin-resistant strains than from LPS of the parental strains, whereas the same amount or more probe was displaced from isolates of the mutants by the structurally similar antibiotic, EM 49 (octapeptin). In general, the differential affinities of these antibiotics for LPS correlated with their antibiotic activity in vivo, suggesting that resistance results from a decrease in antibiotic permeability across the outer membrane due to alterations in the LPS which affect antibiotic binding. The alterations in the structure of LPS from the polymyxin-resistant mutants of E. coli were characterized using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results suggested that esterification of the core-lipid A phosphates is responsible for increased resistance to polymyxin B and that this alteration is different from that previously proposed for the S. typhimurium strains. In both cases, however, resistance was the result of modifications that result in a less acidic lipid A.\r"

The cells rapidly and markedly concentrated the drug: 30% of the final 80-fold intracellular concentration was attained in less than 1 min, and greater than 60% was attained in 10 min. Penetration of [3H]KTZ at an extracellular concentration higher than 0.1875 microM (0.1 microgram/ml) occurred by a simple diffusion mechanism. At lower concentrations, accumulation of the drug was an active, energy-requiring process, dependent at least in part on glycolysis, and pH dependent (optimal pH, 6.6). The active transport system had a high binding affinity (Km = 50 nM) and a high maximum velocity of uptake (Vmax = 1.4 mumol min-1 10(-7) cells). It was not possible to displace intracellular [3H]KTZ with high concentrations of unlabeled KTZ or other antifungal agents. These findings suggest that KTZ is rapidly taken up, highly concentrated, and tightly bound to cellular components of C. albicans.\r"

AZT also had bactericidal activity against Vibrio cholerae and the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. AZT had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria, or most fungal pathogens. Several lines of evidence indicated that AZT must be activated to the nucleotide level to inhibit cellular metabolism: AZT was a substrate for E. coli thymidine kinase; spontaneously arising AZT-resistant mutants of E. coli ML-30 and S. typhimurium were deficient in thymidine kinase; and intact E. coli ML-30 cells converted [3H]AZT to its mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Of the phosphorylated metabolites, AZT-5'-triphosphate was the most potent inhibitor of replicative DNA synthesis in toluene-permeabilized E. coli pol A mutant cells. AZT-treated E. coli cultures grown in minimal medium contained highly elongated cells consistent with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. AZT-triphosphate was a specific DNA chain terminator in the in vitro DNA polymerization reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Thus, DNA chain termination may explain the lethal properties of this compound against susceptible microorganisms.\r"

With the Escherichia coli ampC gene as a hybridization probe it was shown that the genomic arrangement of the ampC region was the same in both strains. To gain more insight into regulatory phenomena, the ampC genes were cloned, and their expression was studied in E. coli K-12. The ampC gene from MHN1 behaved normally and conferred inducible beta-lactam resistance. A regulatory region of at least 800 base pairs involved in controlling repression-induction was located immediately upstream of ampC. Surprisingly, when present in E. coli the ampC gene from MHN2 no longer overproduced the cephalosporinase, and inducible expression was observed. This indicates that in MHN2 stable cephalosporinase overproduction is controlled by another factor which is not linked to the ampC gene.\r"

This was especially established with a clone derived from plasmid R6-5, in which transposon mutagenesis showed that expression of sulfonamide resistance was completely dependent on the linked streptomycin resistance gene.

At least 80% of this blood flow is considered to perfuse the brain. At the same time mean blood velocity in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries was measured by Duplex Doppler scanning. While blood flow to the head and arms remained substantially constant in both groups over the first 48 hours of life (60 ml/100 g brain weight/min), blood velocity doubled in both cerebral arteries in the preterm group. The term infants had higher blood velocities in both arteries at all times, but the velocities also increased over 48 hours, although to a lesser extent than in the preterm group. These findings imply that the major intracranial arteries are themselves vasoactive, being dilated at birth and subsequently constricting, possibly as an autoregulatory response to rising arterial blood pressure. While vasodilated, the cerebral arteries will be less efficient at damping pressure transients, placing preterm infants at particular risk of periventricular haemorrhage during the early hours of life. The implications for possible approaches to the prevention of cerebral haemorrhage are discussed.\r"

There were no differences in these sleep variables when the first and last (fourth) week of treatment with drugs were compared.

There was no mortality and no allograft loss from these complications, which tend to occur late and be amenable to prompt repair. Since the complications of external ureteroneocystostomy differ from those of the internal ureteroneocystostomy, a discussion of their treatment is provided. A review of literature shows that the external repair is growing in popularity because of its good results. The good results are attributable to the use of a short length of ureter, to the use of a continuous monofilament suture that produces an anastomosis less likely to leak, and to the need of a very small cystostomy.\r"

After satisfactory samples were obtained, both needles were withdrawn in the control group, but in the treated group, the outer sheath was used to inject 0.5 ml of isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate to seal the needle track. Pneumothorax was present in 7 (87.5%) of 8 dogs in the control group and in 2 (25%) of 8 dogs in the treated group (p = .0147). Lung tissue exhibited an apparent foreign-body granulomatous inflammatory reaction. This technique could extend the benefits of transthoracic needle biopsy to mechanically ventilated patients, but further studies to prove the safety of isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate are necessary.\r"

Diagnosis is always (99%) possible by two sets of blood cultures, but occasional exogenous causes of bacteremia may cloud the diagnosis, as will culture-negative cases of PVE and skin contaminants. With obvious exogenous sources of bacteremia, achieving sterile blood cultures after eradication of the noncardiac source permits discontinuation of antibiotics after two weeks. When skin contaminants are suspected, withholding antibiotics and obtaining two sets of blood cultures is recommended, because the bacteremia with PVE is continuous. Preventive measures, including perioperative antibiotics, are warranted but will probably not significantly reduce the low incidence of infection already achieved. The major cause of improved survival in recent years is earlier operation (valve rereplacement). This has been demonstrated in the last ten years and is absolutely indicated for major heart failure, ongoing sepsis, fungous etiology, valve obstruction, new-onset heart block, and unstable prosthesis by fluoroscopy.\r"

Moreover, among the total group of depressed patients, there were significant negative correlations between the beta max values and plasma cortisol levels at 4 PM (n = 41) and 11 PM (n = 41) following dexamethasone administration. These negative correlations between beta max and cortisol levels were strongest among melancholic patients both at 4 PM before dexamethasone administration (n = 14) and at 11 PM after dexamethasone administration (n = 15).

We assessed agoraphobic patients for panic and avoidance at these time points: baseline (week 0), midcourse (week 13), and termination (week 26). The causal sequence model was tested by path analysis. Imipramine was superior to placebo in lowering panic and avoidance at both postbaseline time points. Exposure was superior to office-based treatment in lowering avoidance only at week 13. Exposure appeared to produce quicker improvement of avoidance than office-based therapy, but relapse occurred if this improvement was not supported by medication. Exposure did not benefit panic. We believe patients should be informed that imipramine is superior to exposure in inducing a panic-free state. Exposure without imipramine is of benefit only in reducing avoidance, but adding imipramine to exposure is necessary for panic control and substantially improves exposure and exposure maintenance.\r"

A peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was employed using a rabbit anti-apo B antiserum. All 27 liposarcomas examined were positive for apo B, and 23 of these tumors showed at least 2-plus staining on a scale of 0 to 3 plus. Of the ten myxoid liposarcomas within this group, seven showed 2-plus or 3-plus staining, while the other three stained 1 plus. By contrast, 11 of 13 malignant fibrous histiocytomas were negative for apo B; the remainder showed 1-plus staining. Myxoid areas present in three of these cases were negative for apo B. Five of seven rhabdomyosarcomas stained at least 2 plus for apo B. Both benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors showed no consistent pattern of staining. We conclude that apo B immunocytochemical staining tends to be high in tumors whose normal tissue counterparts exhibit relatively large numbers of low-density lipoprotein receptors. Furthermore, immunoperoxidase staining for apo B should be a useful adjunct in the evaluation of soft-tissue sarcomas, particularly in cases with myxoid differentiation.\r"

Strong beta-EP immunoreactivity was present in Leydig's cells of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors; weaker sporadic staining was present in cells of granulosa cell tumors, and faint staining was present in occasional, luteinized theca cells of fibrothecomata. These findings suggest that cells with the sex cord-stromal phenotype that are capable of steroid production can also produce beta-EP. The latter may be a component of the \"functional\" status associated with some ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors and may serve as a helpful marker in distinguishing this type of tumors from germ cell or epithelial neoplasms.\r"

The presence of thyroid follicular epithelium was conclusively proved by the presence of follicular cells immunohistochemically positive for thyroglobulin, and by the ultrastructural identification of non-neuroendocrine cells with features of thyroid epithelium lining the follicles. Progressive replacement of thyroid epithelial cells by carcinoid cells accounts for the predominance of neuroendocrine granule-containing cells and the scarcity of thyroid epithelial cells lining many of the follicles. A variety of neuroendocrine hormones and other immunoreactive substances was demonstrated within carcinoid cells, including somatostatin (five cases), chromogranin (five cases), serotonin (five cases), glucagon (four cases), insulin (two cases), and gastrin (one case). Only one case contained calcitonin-positive cells. None were carcinoembryonic antigen-positive or had amyloid deposits. The carcinoid element in five cases stained positively for prostatic acid phosphatase. While strumal carcinoid shares some features with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, it has sufficient differences to warrant a separate designation.\r"

All malignant melanomas expressed S100 but lacked reactivity for KER and EMA. Conversely, all of 49 carcinomas (12%) that displayed S100 also exhibited positivity for both epithelial markers. The latter group of tumors included 17 carcinomas of the breast, 16 eccrine sweat gland carcinomas, five high-grade salivary glandular adenocarcinomas, four lung cancers, three pancreatic ductal carcinomas, two serous ovarian carcinomas, one clear cell adenocarcinoma of the bladder, and one uterine cervical squamous carcinoma. None of 32 epithelial neoplasms that lacked both KER and EMA (19 testicular seminomas, four hepatocellular carcinomas, eight adrenocortical carcinomas, and one Merkel's cell carcinoma) contained S100 protein. These results suggest that S100 protein is relatively nonspecific as a single immunodeterminant in the diagnostic separation of melanoma and anaplastic carcinoma. The concomitant use of stains for EMA and KER, however, obviates this problem. Finally, since it is somewhat restricted in distribution, S100 reactivity in a known carcinoma may be of some use in predicting possible primary sources for a metastasis of unknown origin.\r"

  ".W": "Two different types of amyloid deposits in pituitary adenomas are described herein. The deposits of the first type are stellate and perivascular masses, with fibrillary inclusions occurring in the intercellular space. No immunoreactive cytokeratin can be detected in the deposits, and the masses are secreted by the adenoma cells. A second, rarer type is characterized by spheroids (40 to 1500 micron in diameter) in which immunoreactive cytokeratin fibrils are present. The fibrils originate in the adenoma cells adjacent to the deposits. The amyloid nature of both types of deposits can be proved by intense red staining with Congo red, green dichroism, and positive immunostaining with antibodies raised against serum amyloid P component. Adenomas with amyloid spheroids are very rare, and most have been proved or suspected prolactin-producing adenomas.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English-language literature of pulmonary choriocarcinoma documented by immunoperoxidase staining for human chorionic gonadotropin, and shown to be primary in the lung by a thorough autopsy. Extragonadal, nongestational choriocarcinoma rarely occurs in the lung; less than 15 cases interpreted as primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma have been reported. This tumor exemplifies expression of a fetal gene in a malignancy of somatic cell origin. We propose that primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma arises from epithelial cells which may undergo metaplasia or divergent differentiation. Such differentiation may occur in visceral carcinomas as a focal change, and rarely as the sole pathway of tumor differentiation in extragonadal organs, where it has been termed primary choriocarcinoma or giant cell carcinoma with ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin production.\r"

The liver was exposed at laparotomy, and tumors were subjected to three cycles of freezing (eight minutes each) and thawing. Freezing was monitored by IOUS, which visualized frozen tumor as a hyperechoic rim with posterior acoustic shadowing. Frozen normal liver appeared hypoechoic after thawing compared with normal unfrozen liver. There were no significant complications. The follow-up ranged from four months to 17 months (median, 7.5 months). Tumor response was documented by pathologic findings (coagulative necrosis), progressive fall of carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and computed tomographic scan evidence of necrosis and shrinkage of tumor. One patient underwent repeated laparotomy five months after cryosurgery and had the frozen lesions resected; there was no residual tumor. This study establishes the technical feasibility and antitumor response of hepatic cryosurgery and the use of IOUS for precise localization and monitoring of cryoablations.\r"

Recently, we developed a series of monoclonal antibodies directed toward specialized differentiation antigens expressed on endocrine cells. Since many of these monoclonal antibodies displayed exquisite specificity for cell surface molecules on the parathyroid cell, we used these reagents as probes to investigate signal recognition/transduction mechanisms associated with abnormal calcium-regulated PTH secretion. Depending on their binding site on the respective target antigen molecules, these monoclonal antibodies either stimulated or inhibited hormone secretion. Thus, defects in membrane-associated structures may contribute to deranged calcium-regulated PTH secretion in abnormal parathyroid cells.\r"

In 50 survivors of shunting or general surgical procedures, the mean (+/- SEM) CPCR-AA was 201 +/- 17 mL/m2/min; in 39 subsequent deaths, the mean ratio was 87 +/- 14 mL/m2/min. Comparing Child's classification with CPCR-AA reveals the following values: class A (mortality, two of ten patients) survivors, 152 +/- 23 mL/m2/min; class A deaths, 96 +/- 54 mL/m2/min; class C (mortality, 13 of 19 patients) survivors, 214 +/- 47 mL/m2/min; class C deaths, 101 +/- 13 mL/m2/min. The preoperative CPCR-AA of 46 patients receiving liver transplants was 91 +/- 9 mL/m2/min; 69% of these patients survived. Preoperative CPCR-AA values correlated significantly with rates of hepatic protein synthesis in incubated liver slices obtained by biopsy at operation in 22 patients. Thus, CPCR-AA determination is a true liver function test, valuable in predicting surgical mortality and selecting transplantation or other operations for cirrhotic patients.\r"

However, Langerhans cells were not found on most corneas after the second to third week in culture. The absence of Langerhans cells was found to be directly related to the condition of the corneal epithelium. During the second and occasionally as late as the third week in culture, the superficial layers of epithelium are sloughed. Examination of the corneas lacking Langerhans cells disclosed Langerhans cells in the sloughed epithelium. The results demonstrate that most corneas preserved in organ culture at 34 degrees C do not contain Langerhans cells at the time of transplantation.\r"

Clinical response was assessed by a patient-kept diary of symptoms and finger systolic pressure that was measured at room temperature and during cold challenge. In vivo platelet activation was determined by measuring plasma levels of the platelet-specific proteins, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. When treatment with placebo was compared with treatment with nicardipine, no significant differences were found in the number of Raynaud's attacks per day, the severity of attacks, change in character in Raynaud's phenomenon, use of hands in winter months, patient assessment of medication or objective measurements of finger systolic pressure, and critical closing temperature. There was a reduction of plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 in the overall study group while taking nicardipine compared with that during the placebo period (mean change 5.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml, P = 0.054, and 1.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, P less than 0.01, respectively). These results demonstrate that while nicardipine was not effective in reducing the episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon, it did inhibit in vivo platelet activation. These findings suggest that platelet activation is not the primary event in the pathogenesis of acute vasospasm in Raynaud's phenomenon, since reduction of platelet activation by the drug did not change the severity of vasospasm.\r"

This result contrasts with the results of previous studies. Similarly, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we detected no significant increase in antibody binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in HLA-B27 positive patients with AS. Low levels of antibody binding were detected by a fluoresceinated antibody binding assay; however, normal rabbit serum, which was used as a control, was shown to have a binding affinity for PBMC that was significantly greater than that of specific K pneumoniae antisera. The results of our present study do not support the concept of a specific cross-reactivity between antibodies to K pneumoniae and the PBMC of patients with AS who are HLA-B27 positive.\r"

These methods rely on the binding of specific antibodies to cellular antigens in order to better define the tumor according to cell type. We treated six patients in whom a definitive pathologic diagnosis could not be obtained without the use of immunohistologic stains. In each case, the definition of a specific tumor category altered patient management. The approach to the evaluation of patients with undifferentiated head and neck neoplasms is important. Close cooperation between the clinician and pathologist is necessary in such cases; this is assisted by a knowledge of the uses and limitations of the current diagnostic modalities being used, as well as proper tissue handling and processing.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension and pronounced disability who were unresponsive to oral vasodilators were treated with intravenous epoprostenol (prostacyclin). All had been referred for heart and lung transplantation. Short term administration of epoprostenol (mean dose 5.5 ng/kg/min) increased the mean cardiac index from 1.8 to 2.2 1/min/m2, improved pulmonary artery oxygen saturation from 48% to 57%, and increased calculated tissue oxygen delivery from 10 to 11.8 ml/kg/min. The mean pulmonary vascular resistance fell by 18% while mean systemic artery pressure fell by 32%. Pulmonary artery pressure rose in only two patients. Continued intravenous infusion of epoprostenol for 1-25 months was associated with subjective and clinical improvement. Exercise tolerance improved as measured by an increase in the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during progressive exercise testing. In those six patients who were able to exercise before treatment it rose from a mean of 7 to 15 ml/kg/min. Those who had been unable to exercise before treatment achieved comparable rates of oxygen consumption after treatment. Two patients died on treatment, three have undergone heart-lung transplantation, and in five the treatment is continuing. Complications included episodes of septicaemia and ascites. In this uncontrolled study of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension epoprostenol seemed to offer a means of optimally dosing the patients with a vasodilator to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and thus increasing cardiac output and oxygen tissue delivery. There was no evidence to suggest that this treatment influenced the progress of the disease.\r"

Direct immunofluorescence was done using suction blisters raised in two patients with LAD and one with CCP. The circulating IgA antibodies in LAD and CBDC bound mainly to the roof of the blister but also to the base, and in CCP they bound only to the base of the blister. The circulating IgG antibodies in BP bound to the roof and base of the blister. These results demonstrate that the antigens in the various linear IgA dermatoses are heterogenous and are localized at different sites. The LAD and CBDC antigens are present in the lamina lucida, and the antigen in CCP is associated with the basal lamina.\r"

Moderate clinical improvement occurred, associated with a statistically significant improvement in skin rash (P less than 0.01).\r"

Ki-M8 antigen is detectable on almost all known tissue macrophages and monocyte/macrophage-related cell lines after appropriate stimulation. In functional terms Ki-M8 significantly impairs the generation of oxygen radicals during an induced respiratory burst. Applied to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias, a clear-cut differentiation of the monocytic phenotype and differentiation is possible on the basis of Ki-M8 immunoreactivity. Ki-M8 represents a reagent specific for the monocyte/macrophage system with regard to antigen distribution in normal and neoplastic cells as well as with regard to its influence on a typical monocyte/macrophage-related function.\r"

In the current study, we have utilized an avidin-biotin immunoadsorption procedure to obtain a population of highly enriched Ia-positive cells for autologous bone marrow transplantation in dogs given lethal irradiation. Dog marrow cells (2.4 to 7.0 X 10(9) cells) that contained 8.6% to 19.9% Ia-positive cells were treated successively with monoclonal antibody 7.2, which reacts with a framework determinant of Ia-antigen, and biotin-conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin. These treated cells were passed over a column of avidin-Biogel (polyacrylamide) and the adherent cells removed by mechanical agitation. Seven lethally irradiated dogs were transplanted with 5.9 to 33.4 X 10(6) recovered adherent cells per kilogram of which 69.0% to 88.0% were Ia-positive. All dogs had hematologic recovery; six are alive and well with durable engraftment and one died on day 15 posttransplant. They are immunologically normal as determined by lymph node and bone marrow biopsies, lymphocyte function, and immunophenotyping of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. These data provide further evidence that canine hematopoietic stem cells express Ia-like antigens and that these cells are capable of complete hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution in an autologous model.\r"

After one hour of incubation, the fate of the ingested plasmid DNA was examined. No DNA degradation was detected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation or agarose gel electrophoresis. Moreover, when pBR322 recovered from ingested minicells was transformed into E coli, no mutations in either of the antibiotic resistance genes carried by the plasmid were detected out of many thousand transformants screened. These findings confirm the surprisingly limited effect of neutrophils on ingested DNA.\r"

Immunocytochemical studies of normal human peripheral blood showed that 7D5 bound to neutrophils and monocytes but not to lymphocytes or erythrocytes. The neutrophils of male patients but not of a female patient with chronic granulomatous disease lacked the antigen of 7D5 as well as the absorption spectrum for cytochrome b558. A mosaic of the antigen-positive and -negative neutrophils was observed in mothers of the male patients.

Of the four assays (platelet suspension immunofluorescence, PSIFT; 51Cr release; microlymphocytotoxicity; and a monoclonal anti-IgG assay, MAIA), the MAIA was most predictive of platelet transfusion outcome (predictability, 74% for one-hour posttransfusion platelet recovery and 76% for 24-hour recovery). The only other assay to reach statistical significance was the PSIFT (63% predictability for one-hour posttransfusion recovery). The degree of HLA compatibility between donor and recipient (exact matches v those utilizing cross-reactive associations) was unrelated to the ability of the MAIA to predict transfusion results. The MAIA may be capable of differentiating HLA antibodies, ABO antibodies, and platelet-specific antibodies responsible for failure of HLA-matched and selectively mismatched single-donor platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".U": "87185834\r", 
  ".W": "Human plasma kallikrein, a product of contact-activated plasma proteolysis, is moderately inhibited by aprotinin, a small polypeptide from bovine lung that has been used as an experimental drug in human disease states. Aprotinin has a Lys residue in the P1 (reactive center) position occupying residue 15. Since kallikrein is an arginine-directed serine protease, we hypothesized that an altered form of aprotinin, Arg15-aprotinin, might be a better inhibitor. Kinetic evaluations were performed in 96-well microplates. We found that the KL (loose or Michaelis-Menten complex) was unchanged by the modification. However, the association rate constant was increased from 1.14 X 10(4) (mol/L)-1s-1 to 1.5 X 10(5) (mol/L)-1s1, thus indicating that the inhibition rate was increased 14-fold for the modified protein. The Ki (at equilibrium) was decreased from 3.2 X 10(-7) mol/L to 1.5 X 10(-8) mol/L after substituting Arg for Lys in the P1 position. Therefore, the modified inhibitor binds to plasma kallikrein more tightly than the natural protein. We also investigated the effect of Arg15-aprotinin on tissue kallikrein, plasmin, factor XIIa, factor XIa, and thrombin and found that the Ki slightly decreased from 5.1 X 10(-7) mol/L to 1.2 X 10(-7) mol/L for tissue kallikrein and slightly decreased from 2 X 10(-8) mol/L to 1 X 10(-8) mol/L for plasmin. Arg15-aprotinin did not inhibit thrombin or factor XIIa, even though both enzymes are arginine-directed serine proteases. However, factor XIa, although it was not inhibited by aprotinin, had a Ki of 3.4 X 10(-8) mol/L for Arg15-aprotinin. Therefore, Arg15-aprotinin is a more effective inhibitor of plasma kallikrein as well as factor XIa but shows minimal preference for plasmin and tissue kallikrein. This study also indicates that it is possible and practical to perform kinetic analyses directly in microplates.\r"

Additionally, all patients were randomized to receive or not to receive cotrimoxazole antibacterial prophylaxis during the remission induction phase. Neither an increase in intensity of chemotherapy nor the antibacterial prophylaxis increased the remission rate above the 53% for patients treated with the standard \"7 + 3\" regimen. The second part of this study addressed the issue of the utility of long-term maintenance chemotherapy. To this end, patients were randomized to discontinue all treatment after 8 months of maintenance chemotherapy or to continue maintenance therapy for a total of 3 years. Although there was a transient increase in the relapse rate for patients who discontinued therapy, the proportion of long-term remitters was identical in the two patient groups. Additionally, there is a suggestion of a survival advantage for patients randomized to discontinue all therapy at 8 months.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions were studied between human neutrophils and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells invaded by Candida albicans. In the absence of neutrophils, progressive Candida germination and hyphal growth extensively damaged endothelial cell monolayers over a period of 4 to 6 hours, as determined both by morphological changes and release of 51Cr from radiolabeled endothelial cells. Monolayers were completely destroyed and replaced by hyphae after 18 hours of incubation. In contrast, when added 2 hours after the monolayers had been infected with Candida, neutrophils selectively migrated toward and attached to hyphae at points of hyphal penetration into individual endothelial cells (observed by time-lapse video-microscopy). Attached neutrophils spread over hyphal surfaces both within and beneath the endothelial cells; neutrophil recruitment to initial sites of leukocyte-Candida-endothelial cell interactions continued throughout the first 60 minutes of observation. Neutrophil spreading and stasis were observed only along Candida hyphae and at sites of Candida-endothelial cell interactions. These events resulted in 58.0% killing of Candida at 2 hours and subsequent clearance of Candida from endothelial cell monolayers, as determined by microcolony counts and morphological observation. On introduction of additional neutrophils to yield higher ratios of neutrophils to endothelial cells (10 neutrophils:1 endothelial cell), neutrophil migration toward hyphal elements continued. Despite retraction or displacement of occasional endothelial cells by invading Candida and neutrophils, most endothelial cells remained intact, viable, and motile as verified both by morphological observations and measurement of 51Cr release from radiolabeled monolayers. From these studies, we conclude that neutrophils are capable of killing Candida hyphae selectively within human vascular endothelial cell monolayers and may have protective rather than detrimental effects on endothelial cell integrity.\r"

We tested these recombinant factors for their effects on the blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Culture methods are available that support both colony formation by AML blasts and the growth of blast stem cells in suspension. Recombinant GM-CSF is active in both culture systems, although to a varying degree. We found that recombinant G-CSF was also effective; however, the two recombinant factors showed striking synergism for the stimulation of blast growth of cells from five of eight AML patients. In these cases, the combination was equivalent to the stimulating activity of supernatants from the continuous cell line 5637. This conditioned medium (HTB9-CM) is considered the standard for blast growth. Blasts from one of the patients grew without added factor. In another instance, recombinant GM-CSF alone was almost as effective as HTB9-CM. In the third case, both recombinant factors were active, but synergism was not observed and their combined effect was not equivalent to that of HTB9-CM. Both GM-CSF and G-CSF were active on normal bone marrow granulopoietic progenitors, but synergism was not observed. We conclude that the marked heterogeneity observed when AML blasts are examined by other criteria is also observed when their response to growth factors is evaluated.\r"

Previously, platelet activation was also shown to be blocked by plasmin formed by endothelium-derived tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). We have now studied interactions between PGI2 and plasmin in the control of platelet function. PGI2 and plasmin cause synergistic inhibition of thrombin- and ADP-induced aggregation of washed platelets. Inhibition by PGI2 is similarly potentiated by TPA added to platelet-rich plasma to generate plasmin. Thrombin-stimulated rise in platelet cytosolic Ca2+, measured by fura2 fluorescence, and thromboxane A2 formation, measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), are likewise synergistically inhibited by PGI2 and plasmin. Plasmin neither increases nor potentiates PGI2-stimulated increases in platelet cyclic AMP. Thus, PGI2 and plasmin cause synergistic inhibition of platelet activation by both cyclic AMP-dependent and independent mechanisms. This interaction between two different endothelium-derived products may play an important role in localizing the hemostatic plug to a site of vascular injury by preventing further thrombin-mediated accrual of platelets.\r"

Recent reports suggest that the malaria parasite can adapt itself to grow in these variant RBCs by producing its own G6PD, but studies on parasite G6PD are very limited. In this report, we define the properties of the parasite G6PD. G6PD was partially purified from infected and uninfected variant RBCs associated with severe G6PD deficiency. G6PD from infected RBCs contained two components separable by starch gel electrophoresis: a major component (approximately 90% activity) with a very slow anodal electrophoretic mobility and a minor component (approximately 10% activity) with the same mobility as the host G6PD. Parasite G6PD exhibited much higher affinity (low Km) to G6P and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) than did human G6PD. Southern blot hybridization indicated that the parasite genome contained nucleotide sequences that were hybridizable with the human G6PD cDNA. These data indicate that the parasite is capable of adapting to G6PD-deficient RBCs by producing its own G6PD.\r"

  ".W": "The total-body irradiation (TBI) technique at St Bartholomew's Hospital has been developed to improve dose homogeneity within the patient. Using a standard 6 MV linear accelerator in an orthodox-sized treatment room, the midpoint doses in head, neck, shoulders, mid-mediastinum, pelvis, knees and ankles are +/- 5% of that of the umbilicus in our current technique. This homogeneity has been achieved by a four-field technique, a reproducible patient set-up, careful use of a new bolus material and an additional beam-flattening filter mounted near the machine head. In addition, thermoluminescent dosimetric data collected at a test irradiation before TBI are used to influence field weightings and further improve dosimetry. This individualised and empirical TBI technique has dosimetric advantages over theoretical TBI dosimetric considerations in reducing dose gradients within the patient. These advantages are discussed.\r"

A survey of the radiosensitivities of human leukaemic cells indicate that they are highly radiosensitive with little fraction size dependence (median D0 = 0.74 Gy; median Dq = 0.14 Gy). These properties, when considered alongside the high repair capacity of lung, suggest that TBI schedules of the \"accelerated hyperfractionation\" type are optimal. The antileukaemic effects of alternative schedules, chosen to be isoeffective for lung damage to a reference schedule of 6 X 2 Gy in 3 days, were compared. A modestly hyperfractionated schedule of 10 fractions of 1.3-1.5 Gy in 5 days has theoretical advantages while retaining practicality of clinical administration.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretic-enhanced 99mTc DTPA renal scanning aims to determine whether or not a kidney is obstructed. In the presence of gross renal tract dilatation the validity of this technique is questioned. Twenty-eight patients (51 kidneys) with the prune belly syndrome, characterised by gross dilatation and tortuosity of the ureters, were studied. These patients underwent diuretic 99mTc DTPA scanning at the time of diagnosis and at yearly intervals thereafter. Long-term clinical follow-up (3 years) with serial serum creatinine was available in all children. In all cases renal function remained stable and on this basis urinary tract obstruction was excluded. Analysis of the first 99mTc DTPA scan included differential function, whole kidney mean transit time (WKMTT) and the time taken for tracer activity to fall to 75% of peak activity after diuretic stimulus (T75). Using the 99mTc DTPA scan, obstruction can be excluded if the WKMTT is less than 5 min or, in the presence of a prolonged WKMTT, if the diuretic stimulus results in a T75 of less than 5 min. A T75 of between 5 and 10 min is considered equivocal and a T75 exceeding 10 min means that obstruction cannot be excluded. 99mTc DTPA scanning, using these criteria for diagnosis, provided false positive information in 22 kidneys (43%). There were no false negatives. 99mTc DTPA scanning with diuretic washout, using WKMTT and T75 criteria, is not appropriate for the detection of renal tract obstruction in the presence of marked upper renal tract dilatation, since the false positive rate of 43% is unacceptably high.\r"

Forty-six patients (83%) in the D-Trp-6-LHRH group and 40 (82%) in the orchiectomy group had a partial remission or stable disease at 3 months or later. There was no significant difference between the groups for response or survival. Three patients in the D-Trp-6-LHRH group had a disease \"flare\" in the first 10 days of treatment. The flare symptoms resolved by the end of 4 to 8 weeks. The incidence of flushing, decreased libido and impotence was similar in both groups. Although there was less psychological morbidity in the D-Trp-6-LHRH group the difference did not reach statistical significance.

The results were not as precise as expected. An improvement from group 1 to group 2 was noticed in both methods (P less than 0.01), but from group 2 to 3 there was improvement only in the method where jiggling was allowed (P less than 0.01). All groups showed a tendency to overshoot the target (P less than 0.01): a shift towards the surgeon in group 1 (P less than 0.05) and towards the opposite side in groups 2 (P less than 0.01) and 3 (P less than 0.05). Jiggling significantly reduced the inaccuracy, and it was concluded that pinpoint accuracy improved with surgical experience. However, the experienced surgeons improve their accuracy by jiggling, with the potential danger of tissue damage by needle adjustment.\r"

Elevation of the total triglyceride and VLDL levels showed a direct relationship to hyperinsulinaemia. Insulin binding to cultured MyD fibroblasts under optimal conditions was significantly reduced but there was no difference in receptor affinity between MyD and control cells. In contrast to insulin binding, LDL binding to MyD fibroblasts was normal although there was a tendency to reduced LDL binding at 37 degrees C that may reflect mildly reduced lipid metabolism. The alterations in lipids and insulin in MyD are compatible with insulin resistance. Laboratory and clinical findings in MyD were compared with other inherited insulin-resistant diseases. MyD showed marked similarity to a group of disorders that have mild insulin resistance and mildly elevated plasma insulin in contrast to others with severe hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance. It is suggested that at least some clinical features of MyD may be due to diminished overall effect of insulin or other trophic factors on cell metabolism.\r"

We describe three patients with a history of mood swings associated with menstruation in whom major affective disorders developed, necessitating intensive psychiatric treatment or admission to hospital. Among women who manifest menstrual mood changes, manic-depressive illness may develop only in a subgroup with genetic predisposition.

The population at risk consists of people with allergic conditions who are given a beta-blocker for an unrelated condition. Anaphylaxis under these conditions may be severe, protracted and resistant to conventional treatment because of the beta-adrenergic blockade. Severe or fatal attacks have been triggered by insect stings, the ingestion of allergenic foods or drugs, and injections of radiocontrast media, antisera or immunotherapy antigens. These occurrences are probably infrequent, but their incidence is unknown. At least two fatal cases have recently occurred in Canada. Clinical allergists, internists and family practitioners in particular should be aware of the need for aggressive and prolonged support in patients who experience anaphylaxis while receiving beta-blocker therapy and should report all such occurrences to the federal registry of adverse drug reactions. Allergy skin testing or immunotherapy is inadvisable in patients who take a beta-blocker orally or in the form of ophthalmic eyedrops. The list of relative contraindications to beta-blocker use should be extended to include susceptibility to recurrent anaphylaxis, whether it is idiopathic or due to an identifiable cause.\r"

Postoperative infection developed in 6% of the treatment group, compared with 10% of the placebo group, a difference that was not statistically significant, although a clinical significance may have been masked by the small sample size. A large multicentre trial is needed to determine the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of postoperative VP shunt infections.\r"

Patients were treated according to two protocols, depending on the stage of the tumor: (1) Patients with T1, 2, 3-NO, 1, 2 tumors were randomized to four different regimens: 4000 cGy split course (2000 cGy in five fractions, per 1 week, 2 weeks rest and additional 2000 cGy in five fractions, per 1 week) or 4000, 5000, or 6000 cGy continuous courses, five fractions per week. (2) Patients with T4, any N or N3, any T stage tumors were randomized to be treated with 3000 cGy tumor dose (TD), ten fractions in 2 weeks, 4000 cGy split course (described above), or 4000 cGy continuous course. In the patients with less advanced tumors (Study 1) the intrathoracic failure rate within the irradiated volume was 48% with 4000 cGy continuous, 38% with 4000 cGy split course or 5000 cGy continuous, and 27% for patients receiving 6000 cGy continuous course. The failure rate in the nonirradiated lung ranged from 25% to 30% in the various groups. Patients with adenocarcinoma or large cell undifferentiated carcinoma had better intrathoracic tumor control (35%) than those with squamous cell carcinoma (20%). The incidence of distant metastases was 75% to 80% in all histologic groups. Distant metastases appeared sooner after therapy in the patients with adenocarcinoma or large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. The initial failure rate in the brain was 7% in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 19% with adenocarcinoma, and 13% in patients with large cell carcinoma. The ultimate incidence of brain metastases was 16% in squamous cell carcinoma, and 30% for adenocarcinoma or large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Higher doses of irradiation will be necessary in order to improve the intrathoracic tumor control. Clinical trials by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, some of them involving multiple daily fractionation, are in progress. Furthermore, because of the high incidence of distant metastases, effective systemic cytotoxic agents are critically needed to improve survival of lung cancer patients. The high frequency of brain metastases suggests that, as in small cell carcinoma of the lung, elective irradiation of the brain may be necessary, if not to improve survival to enhance the quality of life of patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic criteria for the two variants of small noncleaved follicular center cell (SNC FCC) lymphoma in the Lukes-Collins classification, Burkitt's (BL) and non-Burkitt's variants (NBL), were evaluated and related to the results of multiparameter laboratory and clinical studies. Forty-two patients were studied: 25 cases were classified as BL according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Seventeen cases were classified as NBL on the basis of greater variability in nuclear size and shape, more prominent nucleoli, and greater variation in the amount of cytoplasm. Neoplastic follicles were present in three cases of BL and two of NBL, indicating an FCC origin for this lymphoma. Electron microscopic examination confirmed the light microscopic features. Immunoglobulin (Ig) monoclonality, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (surface Ig) and/or immunoperoxidase staining for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (CIg), was demonstrated in 21 of 24 (87.5%) of BL and 13 of 16 (71%) of NBL. Clinically, BL presented more frequently in extranodal sites and with gastrointestinal involvement than NBL. Bone marrow involvement was more common in NBL patients. Both groups had advanced stage disease at diagnosis. The median survival was 10.5 months in BL and 7.7 months in NBL. The results of this study indicate that BL and NBL are biologically related variants of SNC FCC lymphoma but have different presentations, which may be clinically significant.\r"

  ".W": "A 1-year-old male infant developed a classic Wilms' tumor of the left kidney. Treatment consisted of a left nephrectomy, chemotherapy, and irradiation to the left flank and associated abdomen. Two years later, a mass in the right kidney was discovered; open renal biopsy demonstrated a mature Wilms' tumor consisting entirely of rhabdomyomatous elements in the biopsy specimen. The patient was given a second course of chemotherapy and 2000 rad to the right flank. Over the next 8 years, the mass continued to grow without evidence of metastatic spread. Renal function deteriorated secondary to compression of the surrounding normal renal parenchyma by the enlarging tumor; creatinine clearance from the solitary kidney decreased from 120 ml/min to 40 ml/min during the 12 months prior to removal of the lesion. Via a nephron-sparing procedure, the 3400 g tumor measuring 19 cm X 16 cm X 9 cm was enucleated from the right kidney without compromise to the remaining normal tissue. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a mature Wilms' tumor with a malignant anaplastic sarcoma arising in the central portion. Postoperatively, the patient received a third course of chemotherapy with no irradiation to the tumor bed. Currently, he is disease-free with normal renal function more than 20 years after diagnosis of the metachronous bilateral Wilms' tumor. This is the first reported case of an anaplastic sarcoma arising within a Wilms' tumor; this individual also is the longest surviving patient with metachronous Wilms' tumor. The various possibilities regarding the development of the anaplastic sarcoma within the Wilms' tumor of the right kidney are discussed, including the possible role of chemotherapy and irradiation in the development of a second malignancy.\r"

Supernatant from 5F4 was used as a primary antibody preparation for avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase staining of multiple cases of renal cell carcinoma, normal tissues, and other tumors. 5F4 produced IgG which reacted with a cytoplasmic structure in paraffin-embedded sections of all renal cell carcinomas tested. There was occasional, weak, granular, cytoplasmic staining of isolated tubular lining cells in adjacent normal kidney.\r"

  ".U": "87188087\r", 
  ".W": "This review leads us to a number of conclusions and suggestions for further study. First, we find wide differences in the meaning of flow heterogeneity, arising as a result of the different methods used. These differences will have to be reconciled to form a comprehensive view of the role of heterogeneity in determining vascular function. Second, in the future, the meaning of heterogeneity must be clearly defined and related to a particular microvascular component, and it is imperative that the differences in scale of heterogeneity be appreciated when comparing data from various laboratories. These heterogeneities have different implications for function, and failure to distinguish among them leads to confusion. Third, the degree to which perfusion heterogeneity is regulated in the microcirculation remains in doubt. Reports of variations in flow heterogeneity in response to physiological stimuli are for the most part based on highly questionable indirect methods. Fourth, the heterogeneity that can be demonstrated at the capillary level within striated muscle does not appear to be large relative to the capacity for the microcirculation to exchange most diffusible solutes. Thus, the inferences regarding heterogeneity, as evidenced by diffusible indicators, are likely to be the result of different preparations, damage to the preparations, or perhaps large-scale heterogeneities in the tissue. An alternate possibility would be that the heterogeneity occurs at the microvascular level but reflects some other aspect of microcirculatory function, such as length or hematocrit heterogeneities, but not flow heterogeneities. Fifth, flow heterogeneity within microvessels implies important consequences for capillary exchange and tissue oxygenation. Heterogeneities of velocity of a magnitude comparable to those observed by direct visualization of microcirculation can clearly produce reductions in oxygen supply to small tissue regions of a degree that may limit oxygen delivery, and thereby, tissue function. Sixth, flow heterogeneity may also influence capillary hematocrit and/or red cell spacing by producing cell separation at bifurcations and a resultant reduction in mean capillary tube hematocrit. There is as yet no agreement on why and how these hematocrits influence tissue oxygenation and function. Although several hypotheses are advanced to explain the distribution of blood flow and red cells within microcirculation, each lacks a critical experimental test at present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac tamponade is a spectrum ranging from pericardial effusions with minimal hemodynamic impairment to effusions causing circulatory collapse. In this study, we examined the roles played by the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system in controlling the distribution of blood flow in chronically instrumented conscious dogs during progressive cardiac tamponade. Fifty-one episodes of acute cardiac tamponade were induced to decompensation (decline in mean aortic blood pressure to 70% of the level present when the pericardium was free of fluid) in 6 dogs by intrapericardial infusion of warmed saline solution. Cardiac output (electromagnetic flow probe), intrapericardial pressure, aortic and right atrial blood pressures, and renal, coronary, and mesenteric artery blood flows (Doppler flow probes) were recorded during tamponade in the absence of blockade (control), during alpha-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine), beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol), or angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade (captopril). Aortic and mesenteric artery blood flow decreased progressively during cardiac tamponade regardless of the presence or absence of blockade. Coronary artery blood flow did not significantly change during alpha-adrenergic blockade, suggesting that the continuous decline observed during cardiac tamponade in the absence of blockade was at least in part mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. Renal artery blood flow, in contrast, was well maintained in all situations, confirming the importance of autoregulation in this vascular bed during cardiac tamponade.\r"

The 5-HT-LI fibers, however, were not detected in these arteries when fixed either in vitro or in situ after first being perfused with Krebs solution in situ to flush the blood component from the lumen prior to dissection. In these arteries, 5-HT-LI nerve fibers with intense immunofluorescence, however, reappeared following incubation with 5-HT in vitro. The intensity of the 5-HT-LI fibers seemed to be proportional to the duration and 5-HT concentration during incubation. Following chronic surgical sympathectomy, 5-HT-LI fibers were not detected in arteries before or after incubation with 5-HT. Transmural nerve stimulation elicited constriction in 50% of the control arterial segments examined. The constriction was not affected by ketanserin but was prevented by guanethidine and chronic surgical sympathectomy. The remaining arterial segments that did not respond on transmural nerve stimulation, however, became constrictive on transmural nerve stimulation following incubation with 5-HT in vitro. The constriction was blocked by ketanserin and clonidine. These results demonstrate that the large cerebral artery of the rabbit brain has extremely sparse or no authentic 5-HT-LI nerves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, we investigated in seven healthy male volunteers the effect of a low-dose aspirin regimen (35 mg acetylsalicylate per day for 7 days) on the formation of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in blood emerging from a standardized injury of the microvasculature made to determine skin bleeding time. When subjects were treated with placebo, there was rapid and substantial generation of TxA2 and PGI2 at the site of platelet-vessel wall interaction within the first 2 min after vascular injury. This was reflected by a greater than 100-fold and greater than 10-fold increase in thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) in blood obtained from incisions made to determine bleeding time as compared with the corresponding plasma values. Low-dose aspirin caused a significant inhibition of both TxA2 and PGI2 generation in blood sampled from the skin incisions, represented by a 85% and 92% and 81% and 84% inhibition of TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, respectively, as compared with controls. We therefore conclude that rapid activation of both platelet prostaglandin metabolism and vascular PGI2 biosynthesis occurs at the site of platelet-vessel wall interaction, and low-dose aspirin results in a significant inhibition of both platelet and vascular cyclooxygenase activity. Thus, our data fail to confirm the concept of a differential effect of low-dose aspirin on platelet and vascular prostaglandin synthesis in man in vivo.\r"

Responses of mean arterial pressure, forearm vascular resistance, and plasma norepinephrine were assessed during lower-body negative pressure and the cold pressor test. Reflex increases in forearm vascular resistance (1.5 +/- 1, 5.0 +/- 1.4, and 6.4 +/- 2.1 vs 14.5 +/- 4.5, 20.3 +/- 6.5, and 34 +/- 11 units) and plasma norepinephrine (42 +/- 12, 58 +/- 15, and 62 +/- 13 vs 49 +/- 14, 94 +/- 25, and 173 +/- 36 pg/ml) during lower-body negative pressure (at -10, -20, and -40 mm Hg) were strikingly smaller in cardiac transplant patients than in normal subjects. The impaired responses of the cardiac transplant patients were not the result of a nonspecific depression of cardiovascular reflexes, since increases in mean arterial pressure (12 +/- 3 vs 10 +/- 2 mm Hg), forearm vascular resistance (19.5 +/- 3.4 vs 18 +/- 5.8 units), and plasma norepinephrine (56 +/- 8 vs 42 +/- 11 pg/ml) during cold pressor test were not significantly different in the two groups. Furthermore, the impaired responses were not caused by the immunosuppressive agents used to treat the cardiac transplant patients, since patients with renal transplants on similar regimens had augmented forearm vasoconstrictor responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whether this precedes the development of clinical disease and therefore may be important in the pathogenesis of pregnancy-induced hypertension or is a secondary event is unknown. We prospectively determined prostacyclin biosynthesis in pregnant subjects at risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension by use of noninvasive approach, measurement of the urinary metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Patients were recruited at less than 20 weeks gestation. After delivery, patients were retrospectively allocated by use of preset criteria, to one of four groups: pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 12), hypertension in labor (n = 22), chronic hypertension (n = 9), and normotension (n = 24). There was a significant increase in prostacyclin biosynthesis in all study groups during gestation. However, patients who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension exhibited a lesser increment and this difference persisted throughout gestation. These results are consistent with a pathophysiologic role for altered prostacyclin biosynthesis in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension. In addition, decreased prostacyclin formation identifies a population at risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension. Such information would assist the design of clinical trials of drugs, such as aspirin, that might prevent the development of this disease.\r"

  ".U": "87188161\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past several decades, pharmacologic advances have made it possible to markedly alleviate symptoms in most patients with congestive heart failure. However, the prognosis for these patients remains poor. Five years after the onset of congestive heart failure, only approximately 50% of patients are alive; when cardiac failure develops after myocardial infarction mortality is even higher. Survival rates are only 40% to 60% after 1 year in patients with advanced symptoms who are followed in referral centers. Thirty to fifty percent of deaths are sudden and unexpected. Mortality is highest in patients with severe or progressive symptoms, but it appears to be unrelated to the cause of heart failure or its duration. In general, rate of survival is lowest in patients with the most severe depression of left ventricular function, but no hemodynamic index is capable of providing prognostic information in individual patients. Survival is also reduced in patients with frequent ventricular arrhythmias, marked electrolyte disturbances, and elevated plasma catecholamines, but again, none of these measurements are powerful discriminators between survivors and nonsurvivors. A number of pharmacologic and other interventions have the potential to alter the prognosis of congestive heart failure, either by improving or perhaps even by worsening survival. The pooled data from several short-term controlled trials have raised the possibility that the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The high mortality of heart failure is associated with hemodynamic abnormalities, depressed cardiac function, and reduced exercise capacity. That these factors can be modified by drug treatment is of potential prognostic significance. Hemodynamic variables are related to survival, and long-term prognosis is better in patients with only midly abnormal cardiac output or ventricular filling pressures. Indexes of left ventricular function such as ejection or shortening fraction tend to be higher in patients who survive for longer periods. The relation between exercise capacity and survival, however, is unclear. Those patients with severe exercise intolerance (maximal oxygen uptake below 10 ml/min/kg) or with severe symptoms are at great risk of dying. However, exercise capacity and functional class are not related to prognosis when all classes of patients are considered together, especially if class IV patients are excluded. Most of the available data derive from retrospective analyses of trials involving heterogeneous patient populations and aimed at improving left ventricular performance or functional capacity. Large prospective trials aimed primarily at affecting mortality in a broad spectrum of patients are needed to learn more about determinants of survival in heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with congestive heart failure have a high incidence of sudden cardiac death that is attributed to ventricular arrhythmias. The mortality rate in a group of patients with class III and IV heart failure is about 40% per year, and half of the deaths are sudden. Half of the patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure have unsustained ventricular tachycardia detected on a 24 hr continuous electrocardiographic recording. The presence of ventricular tachycardia in patients with congestive heart failure increases the probability of dying; in class III or IV heart failure, the presence of unsustained ventricular tachycardia on a 24 hr continuous ECG recording increases the odds of dying about threefold over a 1 to 2 year follow-up period. Many electrical, mechanical, humoral, and electrolyte abnormalities may promote ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure. Correction of these predisposing factors could reduce the risk of lethal ventricular arrhythmias and therefore every effort should be made to do so. Because there has been no definitive study of the impact of antiarrhythmic drug treatment on the survival of patients with heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, the role of therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs remains uncertain at the present time.\r"

  ".U": "87188164\r", 
  ".W": "A series of neurohumoral systems are activated in congestive heart failure that contribute to the increased vascular resistance and sodium retention that characterize this disorder. Abnormalities in baroreceptor function are intrinsic to the pathophysiology of heart failure and may subserve the vasoconstrictive and volume overloaded state that defines patient morbidity. Blunted baroreceptor responses to high cardiac filling pressures or depressed cardiac function reduce afferent signals that normally inhibit sympathetic efferent activity, vasopressin release, and indirectly, renin secretion. The resulting increase in neurohumoral activity mediates the redistribution of blood flow that occurs in this disorder. Limb blood flow is usually reduced and may be responsible for exercise intolerance. Decreased renal blood flow and altered intrarenal hemodynamics contribute to sodium retention. In addition, renal vasoconstriction and elevated circulating levels of angiotensin II and vasopressin may contribute to hyponatremia by influencing free water intake and excretion. Hence, baroreceptor dysfunction may be a principal mechanism that contributes to neurohumoral activation and subsequent alteration in vascular resistance and sodium and water balance in congestive heart failure. It may not be coincidental that two principal markers of an unfavorable prognosis in patients with heart failure, high plasma norepinephrine levels and hyponatremia, share baroreceptor dysfunction as a common theme.\r"

Among the 642 patients entered into the study, 273 were randomly assigned to placebo, 186 were randomly assigned to the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, and 183 patients were randomly assigned to prazosin; all patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 5.7 years. Treatment with hydralazine-nitrate produced a 28% reduction in mortality compared with that in patients receiving placebo (95% confidence interval, 3% to 46%), whereas prazosin exerted no apparent beneficial effect. Data were further examined to determine if any baseline variables had an impact on the response to treatment. Mortality in the placebo group was higher in those with coronary artery disease, with a history of antiarrhythmic drug use, and with values lower than the median for ejection fraction and exercise tolerance. A reduction in mortality with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate was observed in all of the above pairs of subgroups as well as in those above and below 60 years of age and those with and without a history of hypertension or excess alcohol ingestion. The benefit of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate was particularly prominent in younger patients with a lower ejection fraction and those with a history of hypertension and without an alcoholic history.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most of the evidence that suggests a detrimental effect of positive inotropic therapy on survival remains circumstantial. The pooling of data from long-term studies of patients after an acute myocardial infarction suggests that use of digitalis may be associated with an unfavorable effect on survival. The prolonged administration of intravenous or oral catecholamines is associated with a high mortality rate, which may not be seen in similar patients treated conventionally. The presence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appears to neutralize the benefits of beta-blockade during the first year after an acute myocardial infarction; treatment with such agents after the first year may increase mortality. Long-term treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitors is associated with a high mortality rate, which exceeds that reported in earlier years with vasodilator therapy. Nevertheless, most of these studies of positive intropic agents were not performed to evaluate the issue of survival and did not randomly assign patients to treatment groups. Hence, we do not know that the patients entered into these studies were truly comparable to their proposed control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore administration of antiarrhythmic agents to these patients to prevent lethal ventricular arrhythmias is theoretically appealing.

Moreover, the use of antiarrhythmic agents in patients with heart failure has two potentially serious side effects: worsening of ventricular pump function and exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmias. Such information suggests that the use of antiarrhythmic agents to treat patients with heart failure who do not have symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias is currently not indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Support for the concept that neurohormonal mechanisms play an important role in determining the survival of patients with severe chronic heart failure is derived from two lines of evidence: circulating levels of neurohormones are markedly elevated in patients who have a poor long-term prognosis and the survival of high-risk patients may be favorably modified by treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists. Plasma norepinephrine is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the most markedly elevated levels being observed in patients with the most unfavorable long-term prognosis. Data from uncontrolled studies suggest that low-dose beta-blockade may improve the survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Similar trends were noted in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, in which patients with congestive heart failure before or accompanying their acute myocardial infarction experienced a significant reduction in sudden death when treated with beta-blockers. In contrast, there appeared to be little selective benefit in patients without heart failure, who presumably had low circulating levels of catecholamines. Similarly, serum sodium concentration is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the shortest survival being observed in patients with the most severe hyponatremia. The poor long-term outcome of hyponatremic patients appears to be related to the marked elevation of plasma renin activity in these individuals, since (in retrospective studies) hyponatremic patients appeared to fare significantly better when treated with converting-enzyme inhibitors than when treated with vasodilator drugs that did not interfere with angiotensin II formation. In contrast, there appeared to be no selective benefit of converting-enzyme inhibition on the survival of patients with a normal serum sodium concentration, in whom plasma renin activity was low. These data suggest that neurohormonal systems may exert a deleterious effect on the survival of some patients with severe chronic heart failure, which may be favorably modified by long-term treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "Increased ventricular volume is one of the most powerful predictors of reduced survival in patients with heart disease. Despite its well-documented prognostic significance, the magnitude of the progression of ventricular dilatation from the acute to the chronic phase of myocardial infarction has only recently been appreciated. In an experimental preparation of myocardial infarction in rats, left ventricular cavitary volume increased progressively even after histologic resolution of the infarct region. We hypothesized that this remodeling of the infarcted left ventricle was a response to an increase in both systolic and diastolic wall stresses and that captopril, by reducing wall stress, would attenuate the process. For comparably sized infarcts, the captopril-treated rats had smaller ventricular volumes at common distending pressures, yet they had maintained or improved cardiac output. Most importantly, long-term captopril therapy also prolonged the survival of these rats with experimental myocardial infarction. The implication of these animal studies is that the potential exists for the attenuation of progressive ventricular enlargement and improvement of survival of patients recovering from a myocardial infarction. At the present time, no information is available in patients as to the therapeutic potential of interrupting this insidious process of ventricular dilatation in order to improve survival. Clinical trials are required to determine whether salutary benefits similar to those observed in animals can be provided to patients recovering from a myocardial infarction.\r"

The most important pretreatment predictor of mortality in these patients was the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, followed by echocardiographic fractional shortening, a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and duration of treadmill exercise. The finding of hypokalemia and hyponatremia in these patients at the time of entry into the study was associated with a poor prognosis by univariate analytical methods, but these electrolyte abnormalities did not provide independent prognostic information. The presence of ventricular arrhythmias was related to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, and neurohormonal activation, suggesting that such arrhythmias are multifactorial in origin and may not simply be related to electrolyte abnormalities.\r"

The relations of narrowings of the IMSA to myocytic hypertrophy, myocardial fiber disarray, and fibrosis were also examined. The external caliber and the ratio of the luminal area to the total vascular area (percent luminal area, % lumen) were calculated by an image analyzer in 85 to 203 IMSAs from each patient. The external calibers of the IMSAs were similar among groups of hearts with HCM, hypertensive hearts, and normal hearts but were greater in those with DCM-like HCM. The mean % lumen of the IMSAs was similarly reduced in the hearts with HCM (29 +/- 5% in the ventricular septum and 31 +/- 5% in the left ventricular free wall) and in hypertensive hearts (30 +/- 8% and 31 +/- 7%) compared with that in normal hearts (40 +/- 5% and 38 +/- 5%) and was the lowest in the ventricular septum of hearts with DCM-like HCM (17 +/- 3%). The mean % lumen of the IMSA was inversely correlated with heart weight (r = -.59), the mean size of myocytes (r = -.66 in the ventricular septum, r = -.63 in the free wall), and percent fibrotic area in the septum (r = -.68). The mean % lumen values of the IMSAs in the tissues with and without disarray in the hearts with HCM were similar. Thus IMSA disease is of pathophysiologic importance in patients with HCM, DCM-like HCM in particular, or with hypertension.\r"

On follow-up, it appeared that those persons who developed cardiac lesions did so soon after infection, since the incidence of right bundle branch block and other ventricular conduction defects (VCDs) was also highest before age 20 years. The progressive nature of these lesions was demonstrated by frequent development of additional electrocardiographic abnormalities and high mortality among infected adults with VCDs. In contrast, mortality was low and approximately the same for seropositive and seronegative adults under 60 years who had normal electrocardiograms. Electrocardiography during the early asymptomatic stage of infection was able to distinguish persons with potentially lethal cardiac lesions from those with a benign prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between the quantitatively assessed coronary artery dimensions and the regional coronary flow reserve as measured by digital subtraction cineangiography, we investigated 17 coronary arteries with a single discrete proximal stenosis and 12 normal coronary arteries before and after intracoronary administration of papaverine. Coronary flow reserve was found to be curvilinearly related to minimal luminal cross-sectional area (r = .92, SEE = 0.73) and to percentage area stenosis (r = .92, SEE = 0.74). Normal coronary arteries had a coronary flow reserve of 5.0 (+/- 0.8 [SD]), which differed significantly from the coronary flow reserve of the coronary arteries with obstructive disease, in which values ranging from 0.5 to 3.9 were found. Coronary arteries with a percentage area stenosis between 50% and 70% and a minimal luminal cross-sectional area between 2 and 4.5 mm2 differed significantly (p = .001), with respect to the coronary flow reserve, from coronary arteries with a percentage area stenosis in excess of 70% and a minimal luminal cross-sectional area less than 2 mm2. With the use of hemodynamic equations that describe the pressure loss over a stenosis, a theoretical pressure-flow relationship can be inferred that characterizes the severity of the stenosis. Based on this theoretical pressure-flow relationship, coronary arteries that have a limited coronary flow reserve and critical stenosis (distal coronary perfusion pressure below 40 mm Hg at coronary flow of 3 ml/sec) can be identified with high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (82%). Thus, in coronary artery disease the consequent reduction in coronary flow reserve can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by quantitative assessment of coronary artery dimensions.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have demonstrated an abnormal beta-adrenergic reflex vasodilation during orthostatic tilt. Baroreflex modulation of vascular resistance in patients with CHF was investigated during therapy with a vasoselective calcium antagonist, felodipine. Eight patients on conventional therapy for severe CHF were studied after a 3 week course of additional felodipine or placebo treatment under randomized, double-blind, and crossover conditions. Forearm subcutaneous vascular resistance (FSVR) was estimated with use of the local 133Xe washout. Aortic pulsatile stretch, expressed as the systolic distension in percent of diastolic diameter, was calculated from echocardiographic measurements of aortic root diameters. At 3 weeks, felodipine reduced the arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and FSVR, preserved cardiac filling pressures and heart rate, and increased cardiac output, stroke volume, and aortic pulsatile stretch. Upright tilt (45 degrees) was used to study baroreflex-mediated cardiovascular responses. The unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors during upright tilt was substantial and about equal during both treatment courses, but the pulse pressure was maintained during the placebo and decreased during the felodipine period. During tilt, the patients on placebo failed to increase heart rate and their FSVR, systemic vascular resistance, and arterial mean pressure were decreased, whereas during tilt after felodipine, heart rate and systemic vascular resistance increased to maintain arterial mean pressure and FSVR also tended to increase. Both the stroke volume and aortic pulsatile stretch increased during tilt in patients on placebo but they decreased in those on felodipine. The tilt caused increments in circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine levels during both treatment regimens. Regulation of FSVR during the sympathetic stimulation of orthostatic stress was further elucidated. Proximal neural blockade caused an increase in FSVR during tilt in patients on placebo and a decrease in FSVR during tilt in those on felodipine. Local beta-adrenoceptor blockade caused similar increments in FSVR during tilt in patients on both treatments. Combined proximal and local blockade still increased FSVR during tilt in those on placebo, but caused no change in FSVR during tilt in those on felodipine. This study demonstrates that felodipine normalizes baroreflex control of vascular resistance in patients with CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The American Heart Association recommends that all adults be examined periodically for the presence of silent cardiovascular disease and coronary risk factors. The major risk factors for CHD are smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. Additional factors associated with CHD are high blood triglycerides, reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins, diabetes mellitus, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and certain behavioral characteristics. Available data suggest that the predominance of CHD among Americans can be attributed to these risk factors, and increasing evidence indicates that appropriate modification of these factors will markedly reduce coronary risk. The purpose of this report is to identify the risk factors, indicate their relation to coronary disease, and recommend an approach to their detection in adults during periodic health examinations.\r"

Patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction and those with early postinfarction ischemia share a prognosis similar to that of patients with crescendo angina or with acute coronary insufficiency. Unstable angina after coronary angioplasty and after coronary artery surgery also form particular subsets of patients. Pathologic, coronary angiographic, and coronary angioscopic studies have extended the role of the obstructive atherosclerotic plaque to include a dynamic component to explain the unstable state. Recognized dynamic components are rapid progression of the disease, active vasomotion, plaque fissuring, and thrombus formation. Activation of platelets and blood coagulation factors may play a major role in triggering the syndrome. Our therapeutic approach has also become more specific for the correction of the cause of the disease. Our understanding of unstable angina now appears to be at a turning point, and a pathophysiologic basis for its clinical classification and for its management may soon be available.\r"

D-SR and V-SR prolong treadmill capacity and reduce frequency of angina in patients with stable effort angina. Improvement is mediated primarily by a reduction in resting and submaximal exercise heart rate.

Of note is the individual patient response to the various calcium-entry blockers when combined with propranolol. Although of theoretic concern with combination therapy, no deleterious effect on left ventricular function or increased adverse clinical effects were noted in our studies.

Such patients have been shown to benefit from the application of combined treatment with beta-blockers and nitrates or, more recently, beta-blockers plus calcium-channel blockers. There have been few studies evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the combination of calcium blockers and nitrates, but available evidence suggests that symptoms of excessive vasodilation such as orthostatic hypotension may limit the usefulness of this approach. Recently, the additional benefit of adding a calcium blocker to therapy of patients with chronic stable angina who remain symptomatic on beta-blockers and nitrates has been demonstrated. Side effects related to vasodilation were the major limiting feature of this triple therapy. Thus, a triple therapy regimen may be of value in selected patients who do not respond to the combination of beta-blockers and nitrates or beta-blockers plus calcium blockers. However, caution must be exercised in patients with reduced left ventricular function and conduction system disease, since such patients have been excluded from the reported studies.\r"

  ".W": "Scientific rationale suggests a potentially important role for the calcium-channel blockers in the treatment of patients with coexisting systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease. Clinical investigation confirms the usefulness of these drugs as monotherapy in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina and mild-to-moderate hypertension. There are several therapeutic effects of the calcium-channel blockers in coronary artery disease. Beneficial actions on the major determinants of oxygen consumption, i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility, are generally seen. The potent coronary vasodilating actions of these drugs allow for increased coronary blood flow and alleviation of coronary vasospasm. The effectiveness of the calcium-channel blockers in hypertension appears to be primarily due to their ability to induce systemic vasodilation. Improvements in ventricular compliance, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardioprotection appear to be additional beneficial effects of the drugs. Calcium-channel blockers compare favorably with beta-blockers; they appear to be more effective than some beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly and black population and can be given to patients with bronchospasm or peripheral vascular disease. Calcium-channel blockers are a welcome addition to existing drug regimens available for the management of patients with concomitant coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The use of calcium-channel blockers to treat essential hypertension is increasing, and in the United States several new drug applications for this indication are under consideration by the Food and Drug Administration. Although the ability of the calcium-channel blockers to lower blood pressure has been established, their efficacy and safety in relation to current therapy require further clarification. This article reviews studies in which calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been compared, including seven with verapamil, four with nifedipine and nitrendipine and two with diltiazem. These studies indicate that the two classes of agents produce similar antihypertensive effects and are associated with a comparable incidence of adverse reactions. In addition, the preliminary findings of a multicenter trial in which 50 subjects with mild or moderate hypertension were treated with diltiazem (60 to 180 mg bid) or propranolol (80 to 240 mg bid) for 4 to 6 months are presented. Both medications significantly lowered blood pressure (from 148 +/- 17/101 +/- 5 to 133 +/- 25/88 +/- 9 mm Hg on diltiazem and from 154 +/- 22/104 +/- 6 to 146 +/- 23/91 +/- 11 mm Hg on propranolol). Fifty-nine percent of the patients on diltiazem and 40% of those on propranolol achieved the treatment goal of a supine diastolic blood pressure under 90 mm Hg together with minimum 10 mm Hg reduction. In a similar study, exercise blood pressure and exercise capacity were also examined, with the most important finding being a reduction in maximal oxygen consumption and exercise duration on propranolol without a significant change on diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This review compares the calcium antagonists with diuretics in the management of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy of calcium antagonists appears comparable to that of oral diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide when used as monotherapy. Peripheral vascular dilation appears to be the principal mechanism of the long-term blood pressure-lowering effects of both calcium antagonists and diuretics. Peripheral vasoconstrictor responses to cardioreflex-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation is attenuated by calcium antagonists but not by diuretics. Long-term calcium antagonist therapy is generally not associated with reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system or of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, whereas diuretic therapy results in considerable activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Calcium antagonists appear to have a greater beneficial effect than diuretics with respect to maintenance of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Calcium antagonists, because of their effects on coronary blood flow and heart rate-blood pressure product, offer advantages over diuretics in the treatment of hypertensive patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease. Metabolic abnormalities associated with diuretic antihypertensive therapy, such as hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, lipid changes, and hyperglycemia, are generally not observed with calcium antagonists. Many of these deleterious metabolic changes observed with diuretic therapy may be minimized by the use of smaller doses of these agents than have generally been employed in the past. Diuretics are less expensive and require less frequent dosing than calcium antagonists. Thus, they continue to be preferable first-line antihypertensive agents in many patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.\r"

Prompt reduction of blood pressure can be achieved after either intravenous administration of diltiazem or verapamil or sublingual/oral administration of nifedipine. Effects on cardiac hemodynamics with these drugs are variable. Effects on the kidney are predictable; administration is associated with prompt diuresis and natriuresis. Effects on the cerebral circulation are more complex; although cerebral vasodilation may occur, the potential exists for uneven cerebral perfusion and an increase in intracranial pressure. Precipitous decreases in mean arterial pressure may decrease cerebral blood flow below the lower limit of autoregulation, inducing cerebral ischemia. Because of the complex interaction of these drugs on the heart, kidney, and brain, short-term therapy should be instituted only in the hospital setting, with appropriate supervision and hemodynamic monitoring.\r"

We therefore assessed the concomitant use of calcium-entry blockers and cardiac glycosides, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, and other chemical types of calcium-entry blockers from a standpoint of clinical relevance. We also evaluated reported drug interactions with H2-receptor antagonists, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, general anesthetics, cytostatic drugs, rifampin, and sulfinpyrazone with regard to clinical implications, along with the modification of calcium-entry blocker dose for concurrent social drug use, such as cigarette smoking and ethanol intake. Although a myriad of potential drug interactions exists for these agents, combination therapy is still a reasonable alternative if doses are adjusted appropriately.\r"

  ".U": "87188217\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years therapy with the calcium entry-blocking drugs nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem has made a major impact on the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Although all three of these drugs are approved for the treatment of angina pectoris, some are effective in treating supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and all appear to be effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Reports of their therapeutic potential, however, are not confined to the cardiovascular system, which reflects the ubiquity of calcium ions as stimulus-effect couplers in a wide variety of organ systems. Although chemically heterogeneous, all three drugs produce similar negative inotropic effects in the myocardium and similar relaxant effects in vascular smooth muscle. From a review of the excitation-contraction coupling process in cardiac and smooth muscle it is apparent that \"calcium blockade\" could occur at any one of several loci. Our present understanding is that the effect of nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem is confined to an inhibitory one on channel-mediated membrane calcium influx. There is, in fact, a close parallel between their ability to decrease slow-channel calcium influx in the myocardium and the negative inotropic action of the drugs. Similarly, in vascular smooth muscle their ability to inhibit voltage- or receptor-mediated calcium influx parallels their vasorelaxant properties. With the use of radiolabeled ligands, particularly of the dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nitrendipine, nicardipine, nisoldipine) it has been shown that the drugs show high-affinity stereospecific binding to vascular smooth muscle channels in the same concentration range as their relaxant properties. In contrast, it was originally thought that myocardial binding was of a lower affinity and correlated poorly with the negative inotropic effect. More recent data, however, have cast some doubt on the validity of these observations. Attempts to define specific drug receptors are incomplete at this time. It appears that the dihydropyridine receptor is a 30-60 K D peptide subunit of the calcium channel. Distinct receptors for verapamil and diltiazem are poorly defined, but appear to be allosterically related to the dihydropyridine receptor. By their interactions with the calcium channel, the calcium entry-blocking drugs modulate excitation-contraction coupling, which produces their negative inotropic and vasorelaxant effects. They also interact with other slow channel-dependent functions in the specialized conducting tissues of the heart to slow the spontaneous sinus rate and decrease atrioventricular conduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These factors are reviewed in the context of steady-state coronary pressure-flow relationships, emphasizing the complexities induced by coronary artery disease. Limitations of currently available approaches for the measurement of coronary reserve, examination of flow heterogeneity, and the calculation of coronary vascular resistance are also addressed. Calcium entry-blocking agents have a number of hemodynamic effects that are likely to augment coronary flow favorably. However, parodoxical and potentially deleterious effects on local flow also seem possible in selected situations.\r"

The major mechanisms through which the kidney influences blood pressure are renin release and sodium retention, either together or separately, but additional mechanisms may also contribute. When sodium intake is restricted or a diuretic is used, the reactive increase in plasma renin activity makes a substantial contribution to limiting the decrease in blood pressure. When vasodilators or agents that block the sympathetic nervous system are used, sodium retention plays an important role. Among newer agents, the effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and perhaps dopamine analogs reflects, for reasons that differ from one class of agent to another, a special action on the kidney that limits the reactive renal response to the reduction in blood pressure. Treatment strategies that address the problem of the renal response are more likely to be effective than approaches that avoid or ignore it.\r"

While qualitatively similar, the currently available agents (diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil) differ considerably in relative negative inotropic, vasodilator, and reflex properties. The hemodynamic actions of a particular calcium blocker also critically depend on the baseline cardiocirculatory status. Current information regarding these issues from basic and clinical investigations is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Because vasodilator therapy has become an established approach to the treatment of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there has been increasing interest in the use of the calcium channel-blocking drugs in the management of this disorder. This approach has particular appeal because approximately 60% of patients with heart failure have severe left ventricular dysfunction associated with coronary artery disease, and left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance in these patients may improve after interventions directed at improving myocardial blood flow. Unfortunately, all available calcium channel-blocking drugs possess potent negative inotropic effects; these are normally offset in patients without heart failure by activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, however, are exquisitely dependent on the transmembrane transport of calcium for maintenance of contractile function and show marked attenuation of adrenergic reflexes, which can no longer serve a homeostatic support function; hence, such patients are likely to experience notable cardiodepressant effects after calcium-channel blockade. In clinical trials, although some patients with severe chronic heart failure have been reported to benefit from short-term calcium-channel blockade, the hemodynamic benefits seen are modest compared with those from conventional vasodilator drugs, and little long-term improvement has been observed in randomized, double-blind trials. In addition, 10% to 40% of patients who receive short- and long-term therapy with verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem show evidence of serious hemodynamic or clinical deterioration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with CAD have episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic ST segment depression during routine daily activities. Rubidium-82 positron-emission tomographic studies have provided evidence for decreased myocardial perfusion during these episodes of ST segment depression. The prognostic importance of asymptomatic ischemia has been shown in patients with unstable angina to be a marker for early unfavorable cardiac events. Preliminary results suggest a poorer outcome for those patients with chronic stable angina who show episodes of ischemia as well. Ambulatory monitoring studies suggest that total ischemic activity may be underestimated by conventional testing. Whether all ischemic activity detected by ambulatory monitoring requires treatment awaits further study.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews controlled trials of medical therapy for coronary artery spasm. The calcium antagonists, either alone or in combination with long-acting nitrates, are effective therapy for patients with coronary artery spasm. These drugs definitely decrease angina and the frequency of ischemic ST shifts recorded during continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Therapy is still relatively nonspecific, however, since the mechanism(s) that lead to spasm remain unknown. Interestingly, the initial response to therapy is similar regardless of the presence or absence of severe coronary artery disease accompanying spasm. Drugs that block adrenergic or serotonin receptors or that alter platelet aggregability or prostaglandin production have been ineffective in relieving angina or decreasing the frequency of ischemic ST shifts. Patients with resting angina syndromes are a heterogeneous group; many do not have coronary spasm since other mechanisms also precipitate ischemic episodes at rest. Prevention of angina or ischemic ST shifts may not necessarily prevent acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Both initial and long-term therapies should be individualized according to a detailed clinical and angiographic assessments of each patient.\r"

  ".U": "87188468\r", 
  ".W": "Quantitative correlative investigations by means of light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy carried out in the early phase of the disease on 58 patients (children and adults) with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis (APGN) formed the basis of subtyping APGN into a starry sky type, a mesangial type and a garland type [Sorger et al. 1982 and 1983]. The subtypes also showed differences in the clinical picture. The garland type was of special interest since most patients had severe proteinuria. This caused us to follow-up the patients with these three subtypes (up to 10 years and 7 months). Proteinuria proved to be the most reliable follow-up parameter. A comparison of the three groups showed that proteinuria rapidly declined as a rule in the patients with the starry sky and the mesangial patterns. In the garland pattern there were also cases with a complete disappearance of proteinuria, especially in younger patients, but other patients still had a distinct proteinuria after months to years indicating a protracted or chronic course. The morphological findings of the rebiopsies correlated with the clinical courses, especially with the course of proteinuria. The three morphological subtypes are thus significant for estimating the prognosis of APGN, which is favorable as a rule in patients with the starry sky and mesangial types, but much more unfavorable in patients with the garland type. Even if fewer cases with demonstrated streptococcal etiology were found in the garland pattern group, i.e., among patients with the most uncertain prognosis, than in the remaining groups, these differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, our investigations do not provide any indications that different etiological factors are responsible for the three subtypes. The individual immune response of the host body is likely to be very much more decisive.\r"

  ".W": "IgA nephropathy (IgA N) is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis (27.5%) in South Korea and leads to renal failure in a significant number of cases. To evaluate the possible prognosticators of this disease, renal biopsy material from 142 Korean patients with IgA N was studied by light-, electron- and immunofluorescent microscopy, and a clinicopathologic correlation was made. Modified classification of Meadow et al. [1972] for Henoch-Schoenlein nephritis was adopted for the histologic grading of glomerular lesions. Twenty-three biopsies (16.2%) exhibited histologic grades IV and V lesions in association with high levels of proteinuria, serum creatinine and blood pressure and a low frequency of gross hematuria when compared to the remaining 119 biopsies with histologic grades I to III lesions. Ninety-one patients were followed for one to 6.5 years (mean, 3.4 years). Seventeen patients (18.7%) had chronic renal insufficiency, of whom eleven eventually showed endstage renal failure. More than 70% of the patients with histologic grades IV and V exhibited progressive renal disease, whereas patients with grades I to III lesions had a benign course (p less than 0.0005). These results suggest that histologic grading may be the best index to predict the present state or the subsequent progression of the lesion in IgA N.\r"

By 65 years of age, 50% of women will exhibit bone mineral below the fracture threshold; by age 85, 100%. Trabecular bone loss, which occurs before cortical bone loss, is characteristic of postmenopausal osteoporosis, while cortical bone loss, which increases with age (especially after the age of 70), is characteristic of senile osteoporosis. Estrogen treatment is reasonable for early postmenopausal osteoporosis, less so for the senile variety. The elderly often lose the renal ability to 1-alpha hydroxylate 25-OH vitamin D and thus lose the ability to absorb calcium; they are refractory to D3 therapy, and may require more expensive therapy with 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. \"Trivial\" trauma with falls caused by loose rugs, electric cords, and the like may often be the primary cause of proximal femoral fractures. Sedative drugs are also hazardous. The polyfactorial problem of proximal femoral fractures requires treatment by a multidisciplinary medical team.\r"

Blood flow within the \"avascular\" segment was lower than that of the normal cancellous bone of the intertrochanteric region. A surrounding zone of hyperemia was noted in four of the five patients. Laser Doppler flowmetry was easy to use and is a reproducible method for direct estimation of bone-blood flow.\r"

The reconstructions were studied in vivo with the use of serial radiography, scintigraphy (99mTc-MDP), and bone mineral determination. After sacrifice at 16 weeks, the ulnar specimens were analyzed with the use of high-resolution radiography, autoradiography (45Ca), and histologic study. Scintigraphically, the uptake was significantly higher in the DABM-supplemented implants during the entire investigation. Bone mineral content was significantly higher at four and eight weeks in the DABM-supplemented implants, compared with the nonsupplemented implants, but later it equalized. New bone formation, as reflected by 45Ca incorporation, still occurred at 16 weeks in both types of implants, but it was more intense in the DABM-supplemented ones. Radiography and histologic analysis showed more new bone in the DABM-supplemented reconstructions than in the nonsupplemented ones. High-resolution radiography showed complete incorporation of all seven DABM-supplemented implants, whereas there was nonunion in five of seven nonsupplemented reconstructions. The current study indicates that resected, autoclaved, and reimplanted diaphyseal segments supplemented with demineralized allogeneic bone matrix incorporate better than nonsupplemented implants of autoclaved autologous bone.\r"

Storage at 4 degrees for 12 or 24 hours had little effect on cartilage viability but decreased bone viability to 40% and 10% of controls, respectively. Storage at -80 degrees for five days resulted in nonviable bone in all cases but showed an either/or response of cartilage, with high viability in two cases and nonviability in the other eight cases. In a second set of experiments, femurs from rats were stored in situ at 4 degrees for 12 or 24 hours or were harvested and stored at -80 degrees for five days, after which they were transplanted into rats of a different strain. The antibody response to each set of femurs was measured at two, six, and 12 weeks after operation. The 4 degrees storage resulted in a moderately decreased immunogenicity, whereas the storage at -80 degrees resulted in significantly reduced immunogenicity.\r"

  ".U": "87188523\r", 
  ".W": "The quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon (ligament) were repaired with a Dacron vascular graft used as a tension suture material. In cases of quadriceps tendon ruptures, the Dacron graft is passed transversely through the patellar ligament just below the patella and crossed transversely at the level of the musculotendinous junction with two loops applying tension to the tendon, which brings the tendon ends together by creating a solid structure. In cases of patellar ligament ruptures, the Dacron graft is passed through a hole in the tibia posteriorly to the tibial tuberosity instead of through the patellar ligament below the patella. This technique enables early mobilization on the first day after surgery. The technique was first tested on six dogs with severed quadriceps tendons and patellar ligaments that were repaired with this suture method. All of the animals recovered from surgery and walked and ran normally on the repaired legs within 27 days and with only mild limping after 17 days. The technique was then used on six patients, four with complete quadriceps tendon rupture and two with complete tear (avulsion) of the patellar ligament (tendon). In all of the patients, excellent surgical results were obtained and leg immobilization was virtually eliminated. Physical therapy was prescribed the first day after surgery. The rehabilitation period was significantly reduced.\r"

The drugs were given in randomized order. Each active drug period was preceded by a placebo phase. Endurance tests were performed during both placebo periods and treatment with verapamil and propranolol by bicycle ergometry. Both drugs were equally effective in decreasing resting blood pressure. Verapamil and propranolol reduced exercise heart rate, the effect of propranolol being more pronounced. With placebo, endurance time during exercise was 57 +/- 11 minutes; with propranolol it was 32 +/- 7 minutes (P less than 0.05). Verapamil had no influence on endurance time. The study demonstrates that in contrast to propranolol, verapamil has no influence on exercise tolerance during submaximal work in patients with hypertension.\r"
