Base analogue substitutions that preserve the sequence-dependent conformational motif of the GAATTC site permit deletion of single sites of protein-base contact at a cost of +1 to +2 kcal/mol. However, the introduction of any one incorrect natural base pair costs +6 to +13 kcal/mol in transition state interaction energy, the resultant of the following interdependent factors: deletion of one or two hydrogen bonds between the protein and a purine base; unfavourable steric apposition between a group on the protein and an incorrectly placed functional group on a base; disruption of a pyrimidine contact with the protein; loss of some crucial interactions between protein and DNA phosphates; and an increased energetic cost of attaining the required DNA conformation in the transition state complex. Eco RI endonuclease thus achieves stringent discrimination by both \"direct readout\" (protein-base contracts) and \"indirect readout\" (protein-phosphate contacts and DNA conformation) of the DNA sequence.\r"

A factor, RF-S, was partially purified from human S phase cells based on its ability to activate DNA replication in extracts from G1 cells. RF-S contained a human homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe p34cdc2 kinase, and this kinase was necessary for RF-S activity. The limiting step in activation of the p34 kinase at the G1 to S transition may be its association with a cyclin since addition of cyclin A to a G1 extract was sufficient to start DNA replication. These observations suggest that the role of p34cdc2 in controlling the start of DNA synthesis has been conserved in evolution.\r"

Immature B cells expressing membrane-bound immunoglobulin M (mIgM) are sensitive to antigen-induced tolerance, whereas mature B cells are activated by antigen. Previous studies have established an association between Egr-1 gene induction and antigen receptor (mIgM)-mediated activation of mature B cells. Here it is shown that the immature B cell line WEHI-231 and tolerance-sensitive bone marrow-derived B cells do not express Egr-1. It is further shown that lack of inducible expression in these cells is due to specific methylation of the Egr-1 gene. Thus, covalent inactivation of an activation-associated gene may explain tolerance sensitivity at specific stages of B cell development.\r"

Regional induction was assayed by combining dorsal mesoderm with competent ectoderm. Anterior notochord from the early neurula induced En-2 frequently, while posterior notochord induced En-2 less frequently. Presumptive somitic mesoderm and presumptive head mesoderm, though they induced neural tissue, were not strong inducers of En-2. Thus, anterior notochord may be the primary mesodermal tissue responsible for the patterning of the anterior neural plate.\r"

Freshly isolated human T lymphocytes (G0 phase) were found to have very low amounts of p34cdc2 and cdc2 messenger RNA. Expression of cdc2 increased 18 to 24 hours after exposure of T cells to phytohemagglutinin, coincident with the G1 to S transition. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides could reduce the increase in cdc2 expression and inhibited DNA synthesis, but had no effect on several early and mid-G1 events, including blastogenesis and expression of interleukin-2 receptors, transferrin receptors, c-myb, and c-myc. Induction of cdc2 required prior induction of c-myb and c-myc. These results suggest that cdc2 induction is part of an orderly sequence of events that occurs at the G1 to S transition in T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the human T cell receptor (TCR) alpha gene is regulated by a T cell-specific transcriptional enhancer that is located 4.5 kilobases (kb) 3' to the C alpha gene segment. The core enhancer contains two nuclear protein binding sites, T alpha 1 and T alpha 2, which are essential for full enhancer activity. T alpha 1 contains a consensus cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element (CRE) and binds a set of ubiquitously expressed CRE binding proteins. In contrast, the transcription factors that interact with the T alpha 2 site have not been defined. In this report, a lambda gt11 expression protocol was used to isolate a complementary DNA (cDNA) that programs the expression of a T alpha 2 binding protein. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that this clone encodes the human ets-1 proto-oncogene. Lysogen extracts produced with this cDNA clone contained a beta-galactosidase-Ets-1 fusion protein that bound specifically to a synthetic T alpha 2 oligonucleotide. The Ets-1 binding site was localized to a 17-base pair (bp) region from the 3' end of T alpha 2. Mutation of five nucleotides within this sequence abolished both Ets-1 binding and the activity of the TCR alpha enhancer in T cells. These results demonstrate that Ets-1 binds in a sequence-specific fashion to the human TCR alpha enhancer and suggest that this developmentally regulated proto-oncogene functions in regulating TCR alpha gene expression.\r"

The relative roles of afferents and targets in forming neocortical maps in higher mammals can be examined in ferrets in which retinal inputs are directed into the auditory pathway. In these animals, the primary auditory cortex contains a systematic representation of the retina (and of visual space) rather than a representation of the cochlea (and of sound frequency). A representation of a two-dimensional sensory epithelium, the retina, in cortex that normally represents a one-dimensional epithelium, the cochlea, suggests that the same cortical area can support different types of maps. Topography in the visual map arises both from thalamocortical projections that are characteristic of the auditory pathway and from patterns of retinal activity that provide the input to the map.\r"

In contrast, deletion of nucleotides occurs equivalently in B cells at different stages of development and at different points in B cell ontogeny. Finally, the bias in murine immunoglobulins for one DH segment reading frame occurs at the DHJH intermediate.\r"

An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome. Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia. Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man. Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas. These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation. A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes.\r"

Liberation of Ca2+ was restricted to within a few microns of the site of InsP3 release and, in response to agonist activation, localized regions of the oocyte showed asynchronous oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ release. Results obtained with this technique provided direct evidence that InsP3-induced Ca2+ liberation was quantized and suggest that the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool may be a collection of independent, localized compartments that release Ca2+ in an all-or-none manner.\r"

Both PLC gamma 1 and GAP contain two adjacent copies of the noncatalytic Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The SH2 domains of PLC gamma 1 synthesized individually in bacteria formed high affinity complexes with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)- or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-receptors in cell lysates, and bound synergistically to activated receptors when expressed together as one bacterial protein. In vitro complex formation was dependent on prior growth factor stimulation and was competed by intracellular PLC gamma 1. Similar results were obtained for binding of GAP SH2 domains to the PDGF-receptor. The isolated SH2 domains of other signaling proteins, such as p60src and Crk, also bound activated PDGF-receptors in vitro. SH2 domains, therefore, provide a common mechanism by which enzymatically diverse regulatory proteins can physically associate with the same activated receptors and thereby couple growth factor stimulation to intracellular signal transduction pathways.\r"

  ".W": "A cytoplasmic protein has been identified that inhibits the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of bacterially synthesized, cellular H-Ras protein. This GTPase inhibiting protein is able to counteract the activity of GTPase activating protein (GAP), which has been postulated to function as a negative regulator of Ras activity. The potential biological importance of the GTPase inhibiting protein is further supported by its interaction with lipids. Phospholipids produced in cells as a consequence of mitogenic stimulation increase the activity of the GTPase inhibiting protein, as well as inhibit the activity of GAP. The interaction of such lipids with each of these two regulatory proteins would, therefore, tend to increase the biological activity of Ras and stimulate cell proliferation.\r"

Expression of this chemoattractant in lateral cells of the neural plate and neural tube was induced by an ectopic notochord, and midline neural tube cells did not express the chemoattractant after removal of the notochord early in development. These results provide evidence that a local signal from the notochord induces the functional properties of the floor plate.\r"

Expression of WIT-1 and WIT-2 was restricted to kidney and spleen. RNase protection revealed divergent transcription of WIT-1 and WIT-2, originating from a DNA region of less than 600 bp. Both transcripts were present at high concentrations in fetal kidney and at much reduced amounts in 5-year-old and adult kidneys. Eleven of 12 Wilms tumors classified as histopathologically heterogeneous exhibited absent or reduced expression of WIT-2, whereas only 4 of 14 histopathologically homogeneous tumors showed reduced expression. These data demonstrate a molecular basis for the pathogenetic heterogeneity in Wilms tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation. The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods, each with specific limitations. Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded (ds) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner. Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line. Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer. The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral, immunosuppressive, or other therapeutic effects.\r"

Of specimens with positive results from fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS), 6.3% were HIV-1 seropositive compared to 0.8% of those that had negative results from FTA-ABS. Among specimens positive for syphilis, HIV-1 seropositivity was found almost exclusively among those from persons 20 to 39 years of age and more often among those from men than those from women (9.9% vs 1.3%). Of syphilis-positive specimens from 20- to 39-year-old men, 17.6% were HIV-1 seropositive. In Oklahoma, an area with a relatively low overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection, targeting prevention efforts to young adults who test positive for syphilis should be an efficient way to reach some persons at high risk for HIV-1 infection.\r"

But such recommendations are not supported by the literature, in that there is little information about the independent effect of obesity on survival in subjects who are more than 70 years old. We studied body weight, as assessed by Quetelet's index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), in 162 men aged 75 to 98 years (mean age = 81 +/- 5.3). Length of follow-up averaged 28.6 months. Early deaths (those occurring within the first year of the study) were attributed to preexisting morbid conditions. Cox regression was determined for the entire group, and then for the same group with early deaths excluded. Covariates were Quetelet's index, age, race, history of cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance, and hypertension. Two variables, a low Quetelet's index and glucose intolerance, were significantly associated with decreased survival for the entire group. When early deaths were excluded, however, the only variable significantly related to survival was age. These data suggest that the inverse relationship of body weight to mortality in aged men is due to preexisting morbid conditions and that when these morbid conditions are accounted for, body weight is not significantly related to survival. Hence, the relationship between body weight and mortality risk in aged men differs substantially from that in younger adults.\r"

All residents with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism and 54 (87%) of the 62 with subclinical hypothyroidism had been under medical observation for 1 year or longer. The institutionalized elderly should be screened for hypothyroidism because this abnormality may otherwise remain undiagnosed.

Technical complications encountered included catheter-related problems, mechanical complications of the pump apparatus, and hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic complications were the most frequent and devastating complications encountered. Intracranial hemorrhage accounted for six deaths associated with bypass. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is successful in significantly improving survival of neonates whose predicted mortality approaches 100% with conventional treatment. The rate of infant mortality using the membrane oxygenator is not affected by technical complications related to catheter position, mechanical problems with the circuit, or hemorrhage, excluding intracranial hemorrhage. The major cause of death of infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is the underlying disease process leading to cardiopulmonary failure.\r"

In each case, the referring physician's specialty and his findings on cardiac physical examination were recorded. All patients had M-mode echocardiography, and half of the patients had two-dimensional echocardiography. Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios for the physical examination were calculated using echocardiography as the comparison standard. The combination of a systolic click and a systolic murmur was the physical examination finding most predictive of echocardiographic MVP, with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.43. Other combinations of physical findings yielded likelihood ratios close to 1. No differences were found based on the specialty of the examining physician. We conclude that when practicing physicians find a systolic click and murmur, MVP is likely to be present on echocardiography, though one third of the patients will have normal echocardiograms. Other combinations of physical findings are of little help in predicting echocardiographic MVP.\r"

Those patients who did not have a complete workup were assigned to one of three categories: (1) no mention was made of abnormal liver enzyme values; (2) liver enzyme values were ascribed to some condition other then hemochromatosis and no definitive workup was done; and (3) the condition of the patient was so poor that assessment did not seem indicated. Ninety of 100 patients were not given a workup to exclude hemochromatosis. Physicians often ignore mild elevations in liver enzyme values.\r"

We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction.\r"

This is the first documented case of the above entities induced by the agent. We would recommend, based on our report, that otherwise healthy patients, when maintained on the drug for extended periods of time, have periodic determinations of renal function and hematologic status. As drug-induced erythroid hypoplasia typically occurs after a relatively long period of dosing, it may be prudent in certain individuals to monitor the CBC at approximately bimonthly intervals after initiation of therapy. Recommendations regarding monitoring of renal function are more difficult, as acute allergic interstitial nephritis can occur after either short- or long-term exposure to certain drugs.\r"

Recognition of this connection did not decrease the frequency of episodes. Both persistently refer to the episodes as \"hypoglycemia\" despite recognition that no glucose level below 70 mg/dL has been recorded during an episode. Recurrent episodes of derealization and depersonalization in both patients appear to be sequelae of adolescent incest experiences, but these patients cling to the label \"hypoglycemia,\" perhaps in part because they are unwilling to accept a psychiatric diagnosis for their episodes.\r"

The progression of jaundice in a patient suspected of having acute obstructive hemobilia should prompt rapid operative intervention. At laparotomy, cholangiography or common bile duct exploration should be done. Persistent bleeding should be managed initially with angiographic localization and transcatheter embolization; its failure would necessitate surgical control of the source.\r"

  ".U": "91048237\r", 
  ".W": "An experimental model of the L4-L5 lumbar motion segment was developed that allowed precise manipulation of sagittal translation, rotation of L5 relative to L4, tilt of L4 on L5, and control of roentgenogram quality (image clarity) by placing a water bath between the tube and the vertebral body. A series of experiments were designed to systematically assess the consistency and accuracy of sagittal translation measurements from roentgenograms of varying quality, using different measurement protocols and various rater combinations on models with varying degrees of concomitant motions (rotations and tilts). Study 1 assessed the effects of roentgenogram quality, raters, and seven measurement methods on the consistency and accuracy of evaluating translations in the sagittal plane. Results indicated very high reliabilities across roentgenogram quality, raters, and measurement. As expected, high-quality roentgenograms were more accurately evaluated than lower-quality roentgenograms. However, closer inspection of the consequences of errors in measured translations indicated surprisingly high false-positive and false-negative rates, with significant differences observed between measurement methods. Study 2 assessed the effects of concomitant motions and measurement methods on the consistency and accuracy of evaluations. Within-rater consistency and accuracy indices were remarkably high and similar across measurement methods and degrees of concomitant motions. However, important differences in the false-positive and false-negative rates were again observed. Method 2, described by Morgan and King, demonstrated the overall best performance and the least interference due to concomitant motions. Study 3 assessed the effects of raters and measurement methods on the consistency of measuring translation in clinical roentgenograms, where concomitant motion factors may be present, but not explicitly considered. Results indicated substantially lower within- and between-rater consistency estimates relative to consistencies obtained from the model, although these magnitudes were similar to those reported by others evaluating clinical roentgenograms. The implications of lower consistency estimates relative to increased false-positive and false-negative rates must be more closely examined. These studies present evidence suggesting that high consistency and accuracy indices do not ensure acceptable false-positive and false-negative rates and, thus, provide empirical evidence supporting the view that using roentgenograms as a basis for diagnosing instability often can lead to errors in classification. This is less so when observed translations are relatively large (+/- 5+ mm) on roentgenograms that are relatively clear, with little obliquity, and when concomitant motions are minimal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In vivo creep-recovery and disc pressure measurements were performed on the lumbar spine of immature and mature swine. The creep-recovery measurements were performed using a custom materials testing apparatus designed to apply static or dynamic loads to the spine of anesthetized animals. A series of three separate experiments were performed to assess the effects of: (I) animal death, (II) graded injury to the disc anulus, and (III) respiratory mechanics on the biomechanical response of the porcine L1-L3 vertebral unit (VU). In Experiments I and II, creep rate, modulus, and viscosity parameters were computed using a three-parameter solid rheological analysis of the displacement-time response recorded during the application of a 300-N load. In Experiment III, the effects of respiratory volume and frequency changes on disc pressure were assessed in the unloaded, statically loaded, and immobilized porcine VU. Our results indicated that the adult VU tended to be stiffer, deform or creep more slowly, and had a significantly higher viscosity than the VU of immature pigs. The results of Experiment I demonstrated that the biomechanical response for the VU was significantly altered by the death of the animal; the VU of the living animal (adolescent or mature) was more compliant and deformed at a faster rate than the VU of the same animal after death. Disc injury produced changes in stiffness, viscosity, and creep rate analogous to that of aging, and on the basis of the graded injuries created in this study, it appears that a small defect in the annulus is just as deleterious as removing a large section of anular material. The results of Experiment III indicated that respiration plays an important role in the normal, in vivo mechanical and nutritional behavior of the porcine VU. Altogether, these results demonstrate that, in the absence of normal physiologic conditions, one may not be able to reliably predict the mechanical response of the lumbar spine, and suggest that standards for the testing, handling, and storage of biologic tissue should be established.\r"

  ".U": "91048239\r", 
  ".W": "An animal model was developed to test the hypothesis that discrete peripheral tears within the anulus lead to secondary degenerative changes in other disc components. In 21 adult sheep, a cut was made in the left anterolateral anulus of three randomly selected lumbar discs. The cut was parallel and adjacent to the inferior end-plate, and had a controlled depth of 5 mm. This left the inner third of the anulus and the nucleus pulposus intact and closely reproduced the rim Lear lesion described by Schmorl. Animals were randomly allocated to different groups in relation to the length of time interval between operation and death, varying from 1 to 18 months. At death, the lumbar spine was cut into individual joint units and each disc sectioned into six parasagittal slabs. After observation of the slabs under the dissecting microscope, two of the six slabs, the one containing the anulus lesion and a contralateral, were processed for histology. The results of this study suggest that, despite the great care taken at operation to ensure that the inner anulus was left intact, progressive failure of the inner anulus was seen in all sheep and occurred in the majority of discs between 4 and 12 months after the operation. Although the outermost anulus showed the ability to heal, the defect induced by the cut led initially to deformation and bulging of the collagen bundles, and eventually to inner extension of the tear and complete failure. These findings suggest that discrete tears of the outer anulus may have a role in the formation of concentric clefts and in accelerating the development of radiating clefts. Peripheral tears of the anulus fibrosus therefore may play an important role in the degeneration of the intervertebral joint complex.\r"

A flexion analyzer was used to register trunk movements, and analysis of postures and lifted weights was done from video recordings. The load on the spine at the L3 level was calculated through a biomechanical model, meant for analysis of static, sagittally symmetric postures and lifting tasks. Maximum lift tests were performed before and after a full work day. The peak load on the L3-L4 level when lifting corresponded to an average 22% of the load at the lift test. The mean load during a work cycle was 818 N. It was concluded that the many complaints of back pain could not be attributed to high peak loads, repetitivity of the lifts, or large load doses. Monotony, stress, and low job satisfaction are more likely factors of greater importance.\r"

To evaluate the results, three outcome variables were formed: work, subjective, and disability outcome. The inappropriate signs (IAS) recorded before injections had the best predictability for a good outcome. The mode of injection or duration of symptoms had no significance as a predictor. It was concluded that the outcome after facet joint injection depends on the patient's biopsychosocial chances of self-facilitated improvement. If abnormal illness behavior and distress are found, it helps to estimate the response for treatment and to choose a realistic method of treatment.\r"

Conversely, vertebral fractures were radiographically shown in 43% of the hip fracture patients and in 22% of the controls. Thus, the major explanation for longstanding back pain in the elderly does not appear to be related to spinal osteoporosis.\r"

Results were related to the composition (investigated by standard histologic techniques) and gross structures (investigated by light microscopy) of the ligaments. More importantly, the results were related to the mechanical properties of the ligaments, which include stiffness, failure conditions, stress relaxation, and hysteresis. Where necessary, results were supplemented by or compared with those obtained from pig ligaments. Mechanical properties were related to postural changes by ligament strains induced in cadaveric specimens, using results from the literature. Thus, ligament structures could be related to their physiologic functions.\r"

New methods are described for 1) measuring growth of the instrumented segment of the spine and 2) calculating the predicted growth of the instrumented segment. Eight of the 13 had more than 50% of predicted growth, three had 30-50% of predicted growth, and two had less than 30% of predicted growth.

The spinal radiographs were evaluated by Cobb angle, end-vertebra angles (EVAs), vertebral rotation, and by a new method using the tilt of the surgically fused spinal block in the frontal plane. Spinal growth was measured. Using the conventional criterion for Cobb angle progression, 83% of the lower curves and 50% of the upper curves progress. The use of EVAs shows that progression occurs mainly in the middle (thoracolumbar) segment of the spine. Curve progression occurs in the frontal plane without any significant change in vertebral rotation. The progression of the upper curve Cobb angle is not related to the progression of the Cobb angle of the lower curve; but it is related to 1) tilt of the spinal block, 2) growth of the spine below the block and 3) overall linear spinal growth (T1-S1). Progression of the upper EVA of the upper curve is associated with skeletal immaturity. The key features leading to curve progression after the Zielke operation appear to be spinal asymmetry in the frontal plane, linear spinal growth, and concave lumbar muscle tether (myostatic contracture). The surgical implications of the findings are outlined.\r"

The procedure resulted in immediate deviation of the spine in the frontal and sagittal planes, with moderate scoliosis, convex to the left, and a significant decrease in the normal cervicothoracic lordosis and thoracolumbar kyphosis. Moreover, computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated rotation of vertebra about the longitudinal axis relative to the anterior midline of the body, and deviation of the spinous process toward the convex, left side, of the scoliotic deformity. Rib hump developed on the right side--that of the elongated rib. These changes, which occurred simultaneously in the three planes, were less pronounced in the group of older animals. Two weeks after the operation, the distorted configuration of the spine remained unchanged. The observed changes in the alignment of the vertebrae--changes that, except for their direction on the horizontal plane, resembled those associated with idiopathic scoliosis in man--support the earlier proposed link between the early stage of development of this condition and asymmetry of rib growth.\r"

In one group of these animals, a mechanically produced increase of 1 cm in the length of one rib on the side of the convexity resulted in an immediate correction of the scoliotic deformity, an improvement that was still evident 3 weeks after the operation. In two other groups of rabbits, a further resection of three intercostal nerves, this time on the left convex side, 1 and 2 months after the first operation, resulted in regression of scoliosis or halted its progression. These results further support a new concept in which the precipitating factor in the development of scoliosis is ascribed to asymmetric longitudinal growth of the ribs. They also suggest that regulation of the rib length could be a promising approach to the effective correction of progressive scoliosis at an early stage in man.\r"

Ninety-seven patients underwent needle localization mammographic biopsy of the breast between 1985 and 1987. Indications for this procedure included the presence of microcalcifications or a mass shown on mammographic examination, or both, in conjunction with physical examination which did not define a discrete abnormality in the area. Mammographic, demographic, pathologic, hormone receptor data and staging information were recorded and processed on the MicroVax II computer (Digital Equipment Corporation). Twenty-four per cent of lesions with needle localization mammographic assisted biopsy proved to be malignant. Sixteen lesions were diagnosed as an infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ten of these had an accompanying intraductal carcinoma. Over-all, intraductal carcinoma was present in 16 of the 23 specimens diagnosed as malignant. At biopsy, the margins were clear in 17 of 23, and vascular invasion was present in only one patient with an infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Five were tumor in situ, 12 were stage 1 and five were stage 2 (staging information was not available in one instance). Hormone receptor data were available in 17 of 23 specimens. Estrogen receptors were positive in 13 and progesterone receptors were positive in six. The smallest preinvasive malignant lesion was 4 millimeters, as seen on the mammogram, and the smallest free-standing invasive lesion was 8 millimeters. Preinvasive lesions (intraductal) presented as microcalcifications in 80 per cent. Invasive lesions presented as either a mass (n = 9) or as a mass and microcalcifications (n = 5) in 81 per cent. All five lesions presenting as both a mass and microcalcifications on mammogram proved to be malignant. Multifocal lesions on mammographic examination which proved to be malignant were multifocal pathologically in only 50 per cent. Needle localization mammographic biopsy is useful in detecting early carcinoma of the breast. Biopsy should be done on lesions presenting on mammogram as both a mass and microcalcifications and not observed. Focality of lesions on mammogram does not correlate with focality on biopsy and may be misleading as criteria for operative planning.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and ninety-eight critically ill patients at risk for the development of postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding were randomized into three groups. The first group comprised 85 patients who received meciadanol, a new bioflavonoid, 500 milligrams every six hours through a nasograstric tube; the second group comprised 100 patients who received sucralfate (crushed tablets), 1,000 milligrams every six hours through a nasogastric tube, and the third group comprised 113 patients who received an antacid (Maalox [magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel]) through a nasogastric tube at an initial dose of 15 milliliters every hour. The gastric pH was measured hourly and titrated to a pH greater than or equal to 4.0 in patients in the group receiving the antacid. The gastric pH was measured every two hours in the other two groups. Bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was determined visually (frank blood in gastric contents) or by guaiac testing. Bleeding occurred in seven patients receiving meciadanol, nine receiving sucralfate and six receiving the antacid. The difference in rates of bleeding was not statistically significant. Correlation between the severity of illness index and the development of bleeding was poor, at least in the low and intermediate index range. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between the age of the patient and the development of bleeding. Only one patient younger than 50 years had bleeding develop. Apparently, meciadanol exerts its action by a mechanism other than pH control. It may, therefore, fill an important gap in the ability to prevent postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding.\r"

S. Surgical Corp.) circular stapler has been compared with single layer sutured anastomoses. Only patients in whom either technique was feasible were included in the analysis. The operative techniques were largely standardized. Patients were studied by means of a limited barium enema on the ninth or tenth postoperative day. The data have been analyzed for leakage rate (clinical and roentgenologic), other complications and degree of experience of the surgeon. Eleven patients were excluded from the analysis because the selected technique could not be carried out; of these, eight were in the stapled group in which it was possible to perform a sutured anastomosis. There were no instances in which it was possible to staple but not possible to suture. The remaining three exclusions were patients in whom either a coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure was performed. There was no over-all difference in the leakage rate--roentgenologic, clinical or total--between the two groups. However, when analyzed by the surgeon, the clinical leakage rate for surgeons in training was greater for sutured anastomoses than for stapled anastomoses (p = 0.053). Thus, it appears that the benefits of experience are more pronounced for sutured anastomoses but that, in experienced hands, neither technique is superior.\r"

Four patients underwent segmentectomy and five required lobectomy for removal of the tumors. Two patients had an intraoperative biopsy only. The patients in whom the tumor was diagnosed preoperatively underwent computed tomography and arteriography routinely.

Two months later, at the conclusion of the study, the testes were examined. Histologic degeneration after vascular obstruction was graded by a modified Johnsen's tubular biopsy score (TBS). The testicular concentrations of enzymes (lactic dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase), known to decrease with testicular injury, were measured. TBS and seminiferous tubule diameter (STD) were found to decrease significantly after two hours of vascular occlusion and were similar regardless of whether the obstruction was produced by occlusion of arterial inflow or venous drainage, or both. Testicular concentration of enzymes decreased significantly after permanent ligation of the spermatic artery and vein, but decreased minimally when the vascular obstruction lasted less than 120 minutes. Testicular injury produced by venous occlusion was equally severe and occurred as rapidly as injury produced by arterial or combined arteriovenous occlusion. No significant injury was noted in the contralateral testes in any group.\r"

We describe two patients in whom intraoperative scintigraphy accurately identified active sites of bleeding in the small intestine when other modalities failed.

A retrospective study of 216 patients with a primary cutaneous malignant melanoma that recurred was conducted to clarify this relationship and investigate possible independent relationships between age at diagnosis and sex of patients to time to recurrence. The results of analysis of linear regression revealed an inverse linear relationship between thickness and time to recurrence (p less than 0.001). Patients more than 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis were shown to relapse sooner than those less than 50 years of age (p = 0.014). Sex was not a significant factor in predicting time to recurrence (p greater than 0.10). These results suggest that thickness of tumor provides an indication of time to recurrence in those patients destined to recur and stress the need for long term surveillance in patients with a history of malignant melanoma because of the possibility of late relapse even with thin lesions.\r"

In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap. Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea. In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma. A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three. In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap. However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap. Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea.\r"

The mean over-all survival time was 11.7 months (range of one to 60 months) after surgical treatment of a first metastasis to the GIT and 3.6 months (range of zero to 12 months) postoperatively for a second GIT metastasis. Forty-four of the patients reported complete relief of their symptoms postoperatively.

During his career, he was associated with both Rush Presbyterian and Northwestern Medical Schools. He was responsible for popularizing the use of an artificial pneumothorax as an effective adjunct in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. This modality was not, however, his original concept. In addition to all of the fields of general surgery, Murphy undertook the management of empyema and lesions of the chest wall and also performed thoracoplasty procedures. Although he had done several thoracotomy procedures in his laboratory, he rarely undertook this operation in a clinical setting. Drop ether anesthesia was used for all surgical procedures. Murphy did not use closed water seal drainage of the chest. His oration on thoracic surgery, given at the annual meeting of the AMA, in 1898, was an excellent monograph on the subject and undoubtedly contributed to the increased interest and progress in this field of surgery. Murphy was a wise surgeon, an able technician and a scholarly teacher. The high regard in which he was held by his contemporaries is best expressed by the remark of William Mayo, \"...he was the surgical genius of our generation\".\r"

Until recently, cataract surgery in such eyes was regarded as a hazardous procedure that yielded unpredictable and often discouraging results. Recent evidence from a number of reports suggests that newer surgical techniques and careful medical management allow a significant number of patients with uveitis to undergo cataract extraction successfully. Intraocular lens implantation using in-the-bag posterior chamber lens technique has been successful in selected cases. Careful patient selection, coupled with the use of an appropriate surgical technique, appear to be of major importance. Herein we review the current literature on cataract extraction in uveitis and provide guidelines for patient and technique selection based on the type of inflammation present. The management of common surgical problems and complications is discussed, as is the role of the intraocular lens. Specific surgical techniques useful in the management of eyes with cataract and uveitis are discussed.\r"

These entities include oculoglandular syndrome, conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis, uveitis, choroiditis, retinitis, papillitis and ophthalmoplegia. While EBV-specific serologic tests can now document recent and past primary infection with EBV and also identify patients manifesting atypical immunologic reactions to EBV, the lack of an animal model, the absence of clear-cut response to therapy and the paucity of documentation by culture render the pathogenesis uncertain or the association questionable in many of these cases.\r"

Important parameters of tear analysis with respect to antibody content are the method of tear collection and the laboratory techniques used to detect specific antibodies in the lacrimal fluid. Normal tears contain antibodies directed against both bacteria and viruses, and the antibody response in lacrimal fluid during immunization of animals and humans has been studied to some extent. This response has also been analyzed in humans during and after natural infection with certain viral and bacterial pathogens. It has become clear that local antibody synthesis takes place in the lacrimal gland, but at least some of these antibodies appear in tears because of lymphocyte sensitization in the common mucosal immune system. A certain degree of transudation of serum antibodies to tears is also often encountered, especially in severely inflamed eyes. Much of the data currently available needs to be confirmed, and more extensive studies need to be carried out for many pathogens. Potential benefits of such studies include development of new diagnostic techniques as well as a better understanding of when and how antibodies confer protection or may be potentially damaging.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital craniofacial abnormalities frequently require ophthalmic evaluation and surgical management. Called upon to perform as part of the craniofacial team managing the often severely deformed craniofacial patient, the ophthalmologist must bring a basic knowledge of craniofacial syndromes and developmental anatomy, as well as clinical acumen to help preserve or improve ocular and adnexal function. As an introduction to this area of ophthalmology, the clinical features, classification, appropriate facial embryology, assessment and surgical considerations of the various congenital craniofacial abnormalities are reviewed. The expanding availability of craniofacial surgeons and surgical teams along with improved surgical results will ultimately require an increasing involvement by many more ophthalmologists in the evaluation and management of these congenital abnormalities.\r"

  ".U": "91048403\r", 
  ".W": "In 13 of 398 patients who underwent hepatectomy, tumor thrombi of the remnant portal vein was concomitantly removed by the balloon catheter method in 8, an open method under hepatic vascular exclusion in 1, and resection of the occlusive portal segment followed by portal reconstruction in 4. In 8 of these patients the liver was cirrhotic. The mode of hepatectomy consisted of bisegmetectomy or trisegmentectomy in 11, segmentectomy in one, and partial resection in one patient. Two patients died of portal thrombosis or hepatic failure in the hospital. The mean survival in four patients was 12 months. Seven are still alive (mean, 16 months). In the corresponding period, nine patients with occlusive tumor thrombi of the portal confluence were hospitalized without operation and survived up to 4 months (mean, 64 days) after detection of the tumoral occlusion. The causes of death of the nine patients were bleeding esophageal varices, rupture of the tumor, or hepatic failure. It was revealed that removal of tumor thrombi in the remnant portal vein contributes to (1) portal decompression, (2) feasibility of arterial embolization, and (3) increase in resectability of the main tumor. At present, this procedure might be regarded as an emergency procedure for the avoidance of the above lethal impendence, but it may open the door to an adjuvant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The 19 patients who underwent 22 postoperative repairs of bile duct stricture in our institution between 1973 and 1984 were evaluated to assess whether the recognition of the tenuous blood supply of the supraduodenal bile duct in 1979 had improved the results thereafter. Thirteen of these 22 operations followed a previous biliary tract repair; in 10 of the operations a low anastomosis had been performed without taking blood supply into account. Follow-up was complete and ranged from 5 to 15 years. There were no operative deaths and minimal morbidity. There were three deaths at a later time. Five of the 11 patients treated by surgery to 1979 had a clinically unsatisfactory result: recurrent strictures developed in all five patients. All but one of the eight patients receiving a high hepaticojejunostomy from 1980 had a clinically satisfactory result with no recurrent strictures. The one exception was the patient who had a second repair with separate high right and left hepatic duct anastomoses and who has ongoing symptoms from preexisting secondary sclerosing cholangitis. The results in the five high repairs performed for low strictures were particularly striking: All five were asymptomatic. This study lends support to the hypothesis of an ischemic basis for biliary strictures and to the recommendation that strictures be repaired with a high hepaticojejunostomy.\r"

The incidence was 1.4% in a population of 350 patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The condition was indicated clinically on the basis of a symptom triad of jaundice, fever, and pain with cholelithiasis in a small contracted gallbladder. In addition, proximal intra- and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, calculus in the common duct, and normal-caliber (or unprofiled) distal common duct on ultrasound scan were present in all the patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography proved to be the most useful means of investigation, and it confirmed the diagnosis in four patients before surgery. A modified antegrade cholecystectomy was performed with the gallbladder opened inferiorly at the fundus, and the stones were evacuated. A partial cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty were accomplished with gallbladder flaps whenever feasible. Other useful operative procedures are side-to-side hepaticodochojejunostomy and hepaticodochoduodenostomy. In the presence of high benign bile duct stricture, an approach to the left hepatic duct is now preferred for biliary bypass.\r"

This procedure was followed by arterial chemoembolization or intraportal infusion chemotherapy or both. Follow-up celiac angiography confirmed that the long-term decollateralization was achieved by shielding the liver with silicone rubber sheeting. This technique resulted in partial responses without serious complications in all the patients including two who had no responses to chemoembolization before the procedure. The response durations were 5, 21, and 27, months, respectively. One patient died of gastrointestinal bleeding 7 months after the decollateralization. The other two patients are still alive, and the survivals after the procedure are 28 and 30 months, respectively. This therapy is considered promising and may be worth choosing as an adjuvant treatment for advanced hepatic malignancies uncontrolled by arterial chemotherapy or chemoembolization.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients with necrotizing fasciitis were treated from 1980 to 1988. This study evaluates how the addition of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to surgical treatment has affected mortality and the number of debridements required to achieve wound control in these patients. Two groups of patients were viewed: group 1 (n = 12) received surgical debridement and antibiotics only; group 2 (n = 17) received HBO (90 minutes at 2.5 atm, average 7.4 treatments) in addition to surgery and antibiotics. Both groups were similar in age, race, sex, wound bacteriology, and antimicrobial therapy. Body surface area affected was similar, however, perineal involvement was more common in group 2 (53%) than in group 1 (12%). The admitting conditions of patients in group 1 (non-HBO) were diabetic, 33%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 50%; and shock, 8%. The admitting conditions of patients in group 2 (HBO) were diabetic, 47%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 59%; and shock, 29%. Although group 2 patients receiving HBO were more seriously ill on admission, mortality was significantly lower (23%) compared to group 1 (66%) (p less than 0.02). In addition, only 1.2 debridements per group 2 patient were required to achieve wound control versus 3.3 debridements per group 1 patient (p less than 0.03). The addition of HBO therapy to the surgical and antimicrobial treatment of necrotizing fasciitis significantly reduced mortality and wound morbidity (number of debridements) in this study, especially among nonclostridial infections. We conclude that HBO should be used routinely in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.\r"

However, the motility effects of stapled occlusion are unknown. Myoelectric activity and histologic features were studied after stapled occlusion of the small bowel in a canine model. A 35 cm \"recirculating loop\" was created with a side-to-side anastomosis, beginning 25 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Serosal electrodes were placed at 5 cm intervals on the loop; at a second operation in one dog and simultaneously in three dogs, the bowel was occluded midway between two electrodes with 4.8 mm staples. Fasting recordings were obtained at weekly intervals to 6 months after surgery and were analyzed for slow wave frequency proximal and distal to the staple line and for propagation time of phase 3 of the migrating myoelectric complex across the staple line. The side-to-side anastomosis did not alter myoelectric activity. However, after stapled occlusion of the small bowel, the slow wave frequency dropped from a mean of 18.2 +/- 0.4 cpm proximally to 15.4 +/- 1.0 cpm distally (p less than 0.05). This correlated with loss of myogenic continuity in three of four animals. Propagation of phase 3 slowed across the staple line (115 +/- 27 seconds versus 47 +/- 9 seconds) (p less than 0.02). The bowel lumen recannulated in all animals. Stapling across the small bowel alters myoelectric activity, and occlusion of the bowel lumen may not be permanent.\r"

One patient had massive leakage from the aneurysm after aortography and died during surgery. All patients suffered from multiple injuries. Eighty-three percent of the patients had major operations in addition to the aortic repair. \"Clamp and sew\" technique was used in 18 patients (75%), two of whom had multiple tears of the aortic arch. Heparin-coated shunts were used in five patients (20.8%), and a cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in one patient who had multiple tears. Three postoperative deaths were related to polytrauma, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis. Paraplegia developed in three patients, two of whom had multiple aortic lesions necessitating longer ischemia time during the repair. Only one patient had complete neurologic deficit at the 1-year follow-up. In our series, neither surgical procedure proved superior. We conclude that the \"clamp and sew\" technique for repair of the disrupted thoracic aorta may allow for a more favorable outcome.\r"

However, some ulcers persist despite appropriate management. A randomized study was undertaken to compare two regimens of treatment for such patients. Both regimens included ulcer debridement, cleaning, nonadherent dressing, and graduated compression stockings. In one regimen, sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for 4 hours each day. Only one of 24 patients in the control group had complete healing of all ulcers compared with 10 of 21 patients healed in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The median rate of ulcer healing in the control group was 2.1% area per week compared to 19.8% area per week in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The results indicate that sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression is beneficial in the treatment of venous ulcers.\r"

Rats receiving isografts had indefinite survival with maintenance of weight. With multivisceral allografts (from Brown-Norway donors), the intestinal component was rejected more severely than the companion liver and with about the same severity as when intestinal transplantation was performed alone. Intestinal rejection in either circumstance was a lethal event, causing death in 10 to 12 days. The earliest (by day 4) and most intense cellular rejection was in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This was associated with or followed by cryptitis, epithelial cell necrosis, focal abscess formation, mural necrosis, and eventual perforation. Liver allografts transplanted alone or as part of multivisceral grafts also had histopathologic evidence of rejection, but this was self-limiting and spontaneously reversible when the liver was transplanted alone. Thus the Achille's heel of multivisceral grafts is the intestinal component that is not protected by the presence of the liver in the organ complex. Better immunosuppression should permit successful experimental and clinical transplantation of such grafts.\r"

Syngeneic, male Lewis rats (200 to 400 gm) were used. Preservation for 9, 12, 18, or 24 hours in UW or EC with RR (through the inferior vena cava) was used. The 9- and 12-hour groups experienced a significant decrease in the weight of the grafts preserved in UW. The 3-week survival rate after 9 hours of preservation (n = 6) in UW was 66%, and the survival rate with EC was 0% (p less than 0.025). After 12 hours of preservation, recipient survival rate was 70% (n = 10) with UW versus 0% (n = 4) with EC (p less than 0.025). RR of the graft with cold lactated Ringer's solution immediately before reimplantation significantly improved 3-week survival in the 12-hour group to the level of the control group (no preservation time, 69%). Preservation for 12 hours in UW followed by AR yielded a 3-week survival of 14%; 3-week survival for the RR group was 70% (p less than 0.025). Furthermore, RR allowed a 3-week survival of 33% and 20% after 18 and 24 hours of UW preservation, respectively. In the 24-hour RR/UW group, donor pretreatment with SRI 63-441 (20 mg/kg, intravenously) and recipient treatment with SOD (15 mg/kg, intravenously) or SOD + catalase (15 mg/kg and 5000 units/kg, intravenously) produced a 3-week survival comparable to preservation in UW followed by RR alone. These studies show that UW is a profound improvement over EC for cold preservation of liver and that the new application of RR to rat orthotopic liver transplantation improves survival. However, the addition of free-radical scavengers or PAF does not improve organ function or recipient survival in this model.\r"

This hernia results from the disruption of the musculotendinous elements of the abdominal wall as they insert into the pubis. This disruption is brought about by either the destruction of these musculotendinous tissues at their lower end or the resection of portions of the pubic bone as is sometimes done in suprapubic radical prostatectomies for easier access to the prostate. Seven cases have been identified and reported. Men and women were seen to make up a clinical picture that is suggestive of the diagnosis, namely, multiple previous operations through the lower abdominal wall, procedures of a gynecologic or urologic nature, a herniation that mimics an incisional or inguinal hernia, and a defect that cannot possibly be corrected without the use of a prosthesis. When the diagnosis is accurately established, the polypropylene mesh is inserted in the preperitoneal space and anchored laterally to the ligaments of Cooper and in between to the arcuate pubic ligament and the periosteum of the posterior aspect of the pubis. Excellent results have been obtained, and the success must be ascribed to the recognition of the parapubic hernia as a distinct entity.\r"

To study the independent and additive influences of hypoxia and of cytokines in vitro, human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were perturbed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), by heat shock, and by the cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha alone and in combination. H/R induces new patterns of protein synthesis and secretion that are indistinguishable from those induced by heat shock and independent of the acute-phase response mediated by the cytokines. The H/R (heat-shock) response has priority over and will extinguish gene expression supported by the cytokines. This previously unrecognized hierarchy of stress gene expression could well form the molecular basis of shock-related cell and organ failure.\r"

We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease.\r"

  ".W": "A pancreatic cancer cell line was grown in orthotopic and heterotopic positions in young Swiss/NIH nude mice, which were tested with adoptive immunotherapy. Mice were injected with 1 x 10(7) human cancer cells in the subcutaneous tissue and duodenal lobe of the pancreas. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: group IA (LAK + IL-2) (N = 25) received 2 X 10(7) human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors by tail vein injection followed by 10,000 units of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) given intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 28 days; group IB (IL-2) (N = 27) was given the same dose of IL-2 alone; group IC (RPMI-1640) (N = 18) received a placebo consisting of 1 ml of RPMI-1640 intraperitoneally every 12 hours; and group ID (LAK) (N = 14) received 2 X 10(7) LAK cells but no IL-2. Toxicity was significantly higher in group IB, with a mortality rate of 45.5% (10/22 animals) versus a 0% mortality (0/25) in group IA. None of the group IA or IB animals died of pancreatic cancer during the experiment. The animals that did not receive IL-2 died before 28 days in 14.2% of group IC and in 16.7% of group ID. The area under the growth curve of subcutaneous tumors during the course of treatment and the pancreatic tumor weight at the end of treatment were compared in each group. Subcutaneous tumors had a reduced rate of growth in group IA animals compared to all the other treatments. Pancreatic tumor growth was slowed in group IA. The animals treated with IL-2 alone (group IB) showed some slowing of tumor growth that was intermediate between group IA, group IC, and group ID. A similar experiment was done with irradiated (375 rad) mice. Nine nude mice with tumors were treated with LAK + IL-2 (group IIA), eight received IL-2 alone (group IIB), and seven received placebo (group IIC). The antitumor effect of IL-2 alone was not present in the irradiated mice. A highly significant difference persisted between group IIA and all other groups. There was no difference in the histologic characteristics of tumors in control mice and in mice with inhibited tumor growth treated with IL-2 or IL-2 and human LAK cells. These results show that adoptive immunotherapy with human LAK cells and human recombinant IL-2 is effective against human pancreatic cancer growing in nude mice. This effect is independent from antitumor activity from IL-2 administrations alone.\r"

At the time of operation, all four of the parathyroid glands were markedly enlarged, and their total weight was 900 mg. Part of the resected parathyroid tissue was cryopreserved for further autotransplantation should hypoparathyroidism develop. Two years six months after surgery, the infant was well and had normal levels of serum calcium and immunoreactive parathyroid hormone in the absence of any supplementary treatment. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia in the presence of abnormally low fractional excretion of calcium was found in the father. Based on our experience and review of the literature, we recommend total parathyroidectomy, autotransplantation, and cryopreservation for the neonate with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

We recorded ethanol consumption, history of hypertension, liver disease, cigarette smoking, and mild or severe coagulation disorder in each case of intracerebral hemorrhage and in 48 control patients matched by sex and age. In univariate matched analyses, the frequencies of high ethanol intake (p = 0.009), hypertension (p = 0.05), and coagulation disorder (p = 0.05) were higher in the cases than in the controls. After controlling for possible confounding factors, we found that high ethanol intake and hypertension were the only independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively). The hemorrhagic lesion found in cases with a high ethanol intake tended to be located in the cerebral lobes (p = 0.01), contrasting with the typical basal ganglia location of hypertensive hematomas (p = 0.009). We conclude that chronic, high ethanol intake should be considered as an important risk factor for lobar hematomas in young and middle-aged people.\r"

Cerebral infarction was noted in eight, cerebral hemorrhage in two, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in three. In seven (54%) of these 13 patients, stroke occurred less than or equal to 5 years after systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed. Among the predisposing risk factors for stroke, hypertension was the most important. Lupus anticoagulant was detected in three (38%) and anticardiolipin antibody in three (43% of seven investigated) of the patients with infarction. Evaluation of the clinical manifestations and autoantibodies indicated that renal involvement and high titers of anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody were more frequent in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group. Autopsy studies on six of the patients with stroke revealed small infarcts and hemorrhages in all, but in no case was true angiitis observed. Libman-Sacks endocarditis was found in two of the three patients with infarction. In conclusion, the important contributory factor to the development of stroke in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is considered to be hypertension mediated by immunologic abnormalities. Antiphospholipid antibodies and Libman-Sacks endocarditis are closely associated with occlusive cerebrovascular disease.\r"

We noted intracardiac thrombus in 15 patients; nine of the 15 were started on anticoagulant therapy with warfarin potassium to maintain the prothrombin time between 2.5 and 3.5 (international normalized ratio). Serial two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained for these nine patients before and after anticoagulation, with the plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42, and D-dimer measured at the same time. In eight of the nine patients the intracardiac thrombi gradually decreased in size while the plasma level of fibrinopeptide A fell to within the normal range and the plasma levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 and D-dimer remained above the normal ranges. In the other patient the thrombus disappeared, with embolization to the right arm immediately after starting anticoagulant therapy. Mobile or small thrombi regressed earlier than nonmobile or large ones. We conclude that regression of intracardiac thrombi after anticoagulation may be based on the relative predominance of plasma fibrinolytic activity over anticoagulation-inhibited thrombin activity.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can present as lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in an elderly person, presumably due to increased fragility of the vessels affected by amyloid deposition. For this reason, patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage and suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy have often been treated nonsurgically. Since 1983 we have evaluated 11 patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (nine women and two men, mean age 73 years) who have undergone either intracerebral hematoma evacuation or brain biopsy. Nine of the 11 patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, which was unilobar in three patients and multilobar in six and involved the parietal lobes seven times, the frontal lobes four times, the temporal lobes four times, and the occipital lobes twice. These nine patients underwent hematoma removal, with no cases of abnormal intraoperative bleeding or recurrent hemorrhage. Six patients improved neurologically, and two were unchanged after hematoma evacuation; the remaining patient had a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest during the immediate postoperative period. During follow-up in seven patients (median 11 months, range 1 week to 74 months) none experienced a recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage and four continued to improve. Two of the 11 patients had cerebral amyloid angiopathy diagnosed by brain biopsy as part of an evaluation for dementia, also without surgical complications. This series suggests that patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy may safely undergo operative procedures, and patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage may show neurologic improvement following evacuation of the hematoma.\r"

Their single lesions (43 infarcts and 17 hematomas) were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region, sparing the cortex. Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20. Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients (ipsilaterally in 34, bilaterally in 10, and contralaterally in two). Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe, particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area. The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion, considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances. As a rule, the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional (p less than 0.001) and analytic (p less than 0.05) motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion. Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow, we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis. Interpretation of the clinical consequences and pathogenesis of this phenomenon requires further sequential and pathologic studies.\r"

Among the remaining 805 patients with symptoms and signs suggesting some central nervous system disorder other than stroke, computed tomography revealed a cerebrovascular lesion in 38 (4.7%); 35 of these lesions were ischemic. The computed tomographic findings was compatible with the final clinical diagnosis in 192 (84.2%) of the 228 patients with lesions. In the entire sample of 1,191 patients, a cerebrovascular disorder would have been missed in 38 (3.2%) without computed tomography. On the other hand, computed tomography failed to visualize a cerebrovascular lesion in 40 patients in whom such a lesion was clinically obvious. Our results emphasize that both careful neurologic assessment and a policy of early computed tomography are of crucial importance in the diagnosis of stroke and for therapeutic considerations.\r"

High-resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonography was performed to determine the extent of atherosclerosis, and it was quantified by using a scoring system. The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis was 49%, 59%, and 41% in all 232 patients, the 100 symptomatic patients, and the 132 asymptomatic patients, respectively. Although carotid lesions were detected frequently (87%) in the 30 patients with cervical bruits, bruits were noted in only 30% of the 88 examined patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in these patients were found to be age, male sex, and hyperlipidemia; diabetes mellitus was a possible risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis. Our study did not show a close association between hypertension and carotid atherosclerosis, and this might be caused by the high prevalence of hypertension in our patients. Our findings suggest an increasing prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in the Japanese, though this should be confirmed in a population-based study. Our study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography for the evaluation of early carotid atherosclerosis.\r"

We hypothesized that waveform intensity is directly related to the rate and quality of successful recording and may be compared quantitatively among groups of patients. Among a large group of patients recorded at 800 mW/cm2 emitted power, intensity was strongest in white men, weakest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. It declined with age in women of either race, but not in men of either race. Analysis of the effect of emitted power on intensity predicted that significant numbers of waveforms recorded at 800 mW/cm2 could not be recorded at the current clinical standards of 100 mW/cm2, the difference being most pronounced in elderly black women. Temporal bone window thickness measured in a series of adult cadaver skulls was least in white men, greatest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that temporal bone window thickness is an important determinant of recording difficulty and suggest that increased emitted power can significantly increase successful recording, particularly in black and elderly patients. Increased power alone, however, cannot completely solve the recording problem within safe limits.\r"

To evaluate their relative accuracies in assessing intracranial collateral blood flow, we prospectively compared transcranial Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler of the cervical carotid arteries combined with compression of the common carotid artery in 28 consecutive patients before carotid endarterectomy. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. Three patients (11%) were excluded from compression of arteries because of diffuse disease in the common carotid artery. A total of 199 compressions were performed without complications. Lack of a suitable transtemporal window precluded the performance of transcranial Doppler in three patients (12%). The anterior communicating artery was identified in all the normal volunteers and 80% of patients by both methods. The posterior communicating artery was identified by both methods in 16 of 20 attempts in controls. Continuous-wave Doppler identified the posterior communicating artery in 30 of 50 attempts in patients; transcranial Doppler identified the posterior communicating artery in 20 of 44 attempts in patients (p greater than 0.5). Detection of intracranial collaterals correlated with intraoperative carotid artery back pressure measurements in 23 of 25 patients (92%). We conclude that continuous-wave Doppler of the extracranial arteries combined with common carotid artery compression is a safe and easy way to detect intracranial collaterals, with an accuracy equivalent to transcranial Doppler.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of treatment with the inner ester derivative of the monosialoganglioside GM1 on cortical electroencephalographic activity and hippocampal CA1 morphology after transitory, near-complete cerebral ischemia in rats. Ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method, and we studied only the 58 rats that showed flattening of the cortical electroencephalogram for the entire 30 minutes of occlusion. The ganglioside (n = 30) or saline (n = 28) was administered intravenously immediately after release of the carotid clips and then intramuscularly for 21 days of observation. Cortical electroencephalographic activity was monitored throughout the experiment. After 21 days of recirculation we assessed hippocampal CA1 damage by light microscopy. The results indicate that treatment with the ganglioside reduces postischemic secondary damage to the cortical circuitry (as indicated by significantly higher cortical electroencephalographic activity late after reperfusion) and limits neuronal loss in the CA1 region. Our results lend support to the possible therapeutic use of ganglioside in human pathologic conditions associated with cerebrovascular insufficiencies.\r"

  ".U": "91048694\r", 
  ".W": "Acute cerebral ischemia increases the generation of free radicals, causing cell damage, and theoretically may decrease the activity of the scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase. To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase in cerebral ischemia, we used a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In this model an infarct is produced in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, extending into the lateral basal ganglia. We measured superoxide dismutase activity by using the xanthine oxidase cytochrome c reduction assay in these areas of rat brains. Tissue samples were analyzed 20 minutes, 2, 6, or 24 hours, or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 2 or 24 hours or 7 days after sham operation (n = 8-10 at each time). There was no significant change in superoxide dismutase activity relative to control values in any brain area at any time up to 24 hours after surgery. However, 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion a significant decline in superoxide dismutase activity, to 55%-68% (p less than 0.05) of that in unoperated controls, was observed in all brain areas. Our results do not support an important role for changes in the activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. However, the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity 7 days after ischemia could indicate ongoing additional damage to peri-infarct tissue.\r"

Concentrations of leukotriene C4 as low as 10(-7) M constricted the arterioles. The leukotriene C4-D4 receptor blocker ICI 198615 (10(-8) M) inhibited the response. Endothelial injury by helium-neon laser/Evans blue technique eliminated the constriction and unmasked a slight but consistent relaxation that was not inhibited by 10(-8) M ICI 198615. Since leukotrienes are produced by the brain and enter the cerebrospinal fluid in ischemia, head trauma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, the possibility that leukotrienes C4 and D4 contribute to decreases in cerebral blood flow during these conditions should be considered. However, the present data makes such a possibility far less likely because the endothelium is frequently injured in these conditions, and therefore the ability of leukotrienes to constrict vessels would be severely curtailed.\r"

Neurologic morbidity and mortality were higher in the two hyperglycemic groups than in the three normoglycemic control groups. The neurologic deficit progressed according to the duration of severe hyperglycemia. In the three normoglycemic control groups neurologic status stabilized 120 minutes after the onset of ischemia, in the brief hyperglycemia group stabilization occurred at 210 minutes, and in the prolonged hyperglycemia group neurologic deficit progressed for approximately 360 minutes, coinciding with the death of all but one gerbil, in which the neurologic deficit remained stable until death 23 hours after ischemia. We suggest that hyperglycemia is another cause of progressing cerebral infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral ischemia produces a disruption of calcium homeostasis in neurons. This may explain the extreme sensitivity of these cells to ischemic insult. Prolonged increases in calcium levels may produce irreversible damage to the cell by altering important calcium-dependent enzyme systems such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Five minutes of acute forebrain ischemia in the gerbil produced a significant decrease in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity as early as 10 seconds postischemia and persisting up to 7 days after insult. Because hypothermia protects against ischemia-induced cell death in the gerbil, we examined the effect of ischemia on cell death and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II at different intracerebral temperatures: hyperthermia (39 degrees C), normothermia (36 degrees C), and hypothermia (32 degrees C). In ischemic animals, hyperthermia produced severe loss of neurons in CA1 and moderate loss in CA3-CA4 subregions. Normothermia in ischemic animals produced severe loss of neurons in the CA1 subregion. Hypothermic ischemic animals showed no significant loss of neurons in any hippocampal region. Ischemia produced a severe decrease (17 +/- 6% of control) in calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity in hyperthermic animals, a moderate decrease (55 +/- 15% of control) in normothermic animals, and no decrease of enzyme activity in hypothermic animals. Thus, lowering and raising intracerebral temperature decreased and increased, respectively, the extent of ischemia-induced damage in the gerbil. Because ischemia-induced effects on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity are rapid and long-lasting, hypothermia may protect through preservation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity.\r"

It is probable that alterations of these substances during central nervous system ischemia are involved in the processes that cause irreversible neural damage. Calcium regulates several protein kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation of proteins vital for many central nervous system functions. Using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, we found protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase were severely affected during the first hour of ischemia. Protein kinase A was not significantly affected. The time course of lost protein kinase C enzyme activity closely corresponded to irreversible loss of neurologic function, and there is evidence that protein kinase C inhibitor activity is generated. Also, drugs that inhibit protein kinase C increased neurologic damage when administered during the early phases of ischemia. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation, particularly by protein kinase C, is critical to maintenance of neurologic function.\r"

Among warfarin-eligible patients, the event rates were 1.6%/yr for those receiving active antithrombotic therapy (warfarin or aspirin) and 8.3%/yr for those receiving placebo (p less than 0.00005) (risk reduction 81%, 95% confidence interval 56-91). Ironically, we did not find a beneficial effect of aspirin in warfarin-ineligible patients. On the basis of these results, the study has been reshaped to directly compare these two antithrombotic agents. Insight into the apparent aspirin unresponsiveness noted in some patients also is being sought. Interpretation of the preliminary results and the reshaping of the study have been made more complex by the continued blinding of the investigators to certain portions of the data.

After infarction of the lateral cerebral cortex in the mature rat brain, we found a twofold to threefold increase during the first 3 weeks after stroke in levels of fibroblast growth factors in tissue surrounding infarcts. This increase persisted for at least 2 months and appeared mainly to be due to increased levels of basic, but not acidic, fibroblast growth factor. Because of its gliotrophic, angiogenic, and neuronotrophic properties, basic fibroblast growth factor may play an important role in the cascade of cellular reactions that contributes to wound healing and functional recovery after stroke.\r"

For high density lipoprotein metabolism measurements, high density lipoprotein 3 was isolated, purified, and labeled with iodine-125. The radiolabeled high density lipoprotein 3 was reinjected, and daily blood samples were taken for 10 days. Synthesis rates and fractional catabolic rates were determined from the specific activities and daily decrements. Preliminary data indicate that stroke-prone individuals' fractional catabolic rates for high density lipoprotein 3 are twice those of normal individuals. Also, the conversion of high density lipoprotein 3 to high density lipoprotein 2 is reduced in these individuals, suggesting that high density lipoprotein may be abnormally processed in individuals prone to atherothrombic brain infarctions. We surveyed more than 100 patients with carotid stenosis using a 2.2-kb probe for the apolipoprotein A-I gene. A subset of these patients displays polymorphism with restriction enzymes SacI or PstI. These preliminary findings suggest that gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I may provide a molecular clue of atherothrombic brain infarction.\r"

Following placement on a high-salt diet containing 8% NaCl at 35 days of age, F1 rats reared by SHR mothers had shorter survival times and were more likely to die with cerebral hemorrhage than F1s reared by SS/Jrs. Across reciprocal F1 female groups, enhanced susceptibility to stroke was associated with greater elevations of systolic blood pressure, but this association was not seen across reciprocal F1 male groups. There was also an association between blood pressure and stroke within each F1/gender subgroup: Rats eventually suffering strokes developed higher blood pressure after placement on the high-salt diet than rats that did not suffer stroke. Lower day 35 body weights (before exposure to the high-salt diet) were associated with greater likelihood of stroke both across the reciprocal F1 groups, and within three of the four F1/gender subgroups. The differences in stroke susceptibility between the reciprocal F1 groupings may be due to systematic differences in the prenatal and/or postnatal environments of SHR and SS/Jr mothers and may be mediated by variations in the nutritive capacity of the two inbred mothers.\r"

Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, mild atrophy appears in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Long-term diazepam administration greatly enhances this degeneration, extends the degeneration into the thalamus, and severely disrupts recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Following unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, progressive degeneration of neurons occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and efferent targets in the thalamus. This degeneration can be prevented by chronic infusion of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist. Unexpectedly, this treatment did not facilitate recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Recovery in muscimol-treated animals was impaired relative to saline-treated controls. Thus, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists either may enhance or prevent neural atrophy secondary to brain damage, but the behavioral outcome appears to depend importantly on the excitatory and inhibitory characteristics of the affected networks.\r"

Treated rats received a 4 mg/kg intravenous injection of d-amphetamine 1 hour before unilateral vibrissae stimulation and 2-deoxyglucose study. In nontreated normal rats, metabolic activation was restricted to the major relay stations of the vibrissae-barrel circuit. In amphetamine-treated rats, stimulation-induced increased glucose utilization was widespread, including ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions outside the barrel field circuit. For example, an 84% increase in glucose utilization above control was seen in cortical areas anterior to the barrel field region. Increased glucose utilization induced by stimulation was severely depressed in nontreated rats that had undergone infarction of the left cortical barrel field 2 weeks previously. Vibrissae stimulation failed to increase glucose utilization significantly in cortical areas remote from the infarct. In contrast, bilateral increases in glucose utilization were observed within cortical regions of treated infarcted rats. For example, a 50% increase in glucose utilization was detected in cortical areas bordering the infarct. Thus, in the normal and infarcted rat, amphetamine appears to promote alternate circuit activation--a pharmacologic property that may be advantageous for recovery after injury.\r"

In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex. In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery. Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6. Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing. After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb. Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing. In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery. Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits. The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection. These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage.\r"

Facial contact stimuli governed the degree and recovery rate of contralateral tactile/proprioceptive forelimb placing reactions. Contralateral forelimb placing recovered, whereas hind limb placing was resistant to recovery. Infarcted rats displayed marked recovery of spontaneous limb usage (beam traversing). However, deficits in isolated tactile/proprioceptive hind limb placing reactions endured. Posttreatment with the class IV calcium antagonist flunarizine after neocortical infarction protected sensorimotor function in a dose-dependent manner. This protective effect may be due to the peculiar ionic channel blocking profile of flunarizine. Scopolamine hydrobromide reinstated contralateral placing errors in infarcted rats at a dosage that did not affect neurologically intact rats. The cognitive enhancer sabeluzole, a novel benzothiazol derivative, dose-dependently blocked the anticholinergic-induced deterioration of a sensorimotor deficit in rats.\r"

Denervation did not alter basal cerebral blood flow or the duration of hyperemia, nor did it impair the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia.

Male rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain were anesthetized, the middle cerebral artery was occluded, and the fastigial nucleus was stimulated for 1 hour. Twenty-four hours later, rats were reanesthetized and T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. Rats were killed and the volume and distribution of the lesion was established by histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging estimates of the lesion volume were 271 +/- 41.0 mm3 (middle cerebral artery, n = 5) and 148 +/- 8.4 mm3 (middle cerebral artery + fastigial nucleus stimulation, n = 6; 45% reduction, p less than 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed a lesion of 229.8 +/- 15.4 mm3 involving somatosensory cortex, lateral caudate putamen, and lateral hippocampus. Fastigial nucleus stimulation resulted in a 36% reduction in infarct volume to 146.0 +/- 10.3 mm3. The retrieved zone was largely in the cortex dorsal and ventral to the lesion and mostly posterior to the lesion. The estimates of lesion volume by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology did not differ and were highly correlated (r = 0.90; p less than 0.001). This study confirms our previous finding that fastigial nucleus stimulation reduces the volume of a focal ischemic infarct and demonstrates that magnetic resonance imaging not only accurately estimates the volume of the lesion but also can detect changes as small as 50-100 mm3.\r"

After reoxygenation, recovery of synaptic transmission correlates inversely with the time spent in spreading depression. Recovery occurs more frequently in dentate gyrus than in CA1. Chlorpromazine and the gangliosides GM1 and AGF2 promote recovery from hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission in CA1. Prevention of irreversible loss of function correlates closely with a shortening of the time spent in spreading depression. If Ca2+ is withdrawn before hypoxia, then synaptic function recovers upon restoration of oxygen and [Ca2+]o, despite prolonged spreading depression. When spreading depression lasting more than 6-9 minutes is induced in fully oxygenated slices by superfusion with high-K+ solution, then transient recovery is followed by long-lasting loss of synaptic function. In intact brain of anesthetized rats, synaptic transmission in CA1 recovers after spreading depression-like depolarization lasting more than 30 minutes, but is lost irreversibly after 60 minutes. We conclude that entry of Ca2+ into neurons caused by spreading depression-like depolarization is important in the selective vulnerability of neurons; the duration of depolarization is critical to cell survival; and in the presence of a normal blood supply, neurons resist protracted spreading depression-like depolarization.\r"

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these changes could lead to new abilities to promote regeneration and retard neural degeneration after ischemia. Because ionic changes occur after nonneural cells are exposed to mitogens, we have begun to examine the ionic changes that may trigger reactive gliosis. We showed that two changes thought to be important for mitogenesis, elevation of interstitial potassium or intracellular pH, are correlated with reactive gliosis as indicated by increased immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein. This relation was seen after activation of cerebral cortex by recurrent spreading depression but not by physiologic stimulation. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis occurs in fibroblasts only when intracellular potassium exceeds 90 mM, a level seen in astrocytes only during spreading depression. Thus, our results support the contention that a threshold level of potassium (and pH) must be exceeded in eukaryotic cells before proliferation or anabolism will proceed.\r"

In previous studies using the gerbil carotid occlusion model, we demonstrated that CA1b pyramidal cell degeneration is preceded by a period of enhanced excitatory transmission. Experiments with hippocampal slices prepared after 5 minutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion show that ischemia enhances excitatory synaptic transmission and reduces pyramidal cell excitability before it abolishes synaptic function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that these effects require the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors during the postischemic period. Hippocampal slices were prepared 20-30 minutes after carotid occlusion, and Schaffer collateral-commissural input-output curves were constructed from recordings made every 30-60 minutes for 11-14 hours. Inclusion of the selective, reversible N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 3-((+-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid in the superfusion medium completely prevented the progressive loss of pyramidal cell excitability that normally follows this ischemic insult. This antagonist also prevented the postischemic increases in the duration and initial slope of the focally-recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential. The antagonist could still partially block the effects of transient forebrain ischemia when treatment was delayed for 4 hours. Our results confirm that the deleterious electrophysiologic changes in area CA1b depend on the continuing activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Delayed ischemic neuronal death may result, in part, from excessive synaptic excitation during the postischemic period. However, other factors that are eliminated by preparing hippocampal slices appear to play an important role as well.\r"

Calcium-calmodulin binding was graded by an immunohistochemical assay after 2 and 24 hours of reperfusion (n = 5-6 at each time period), and histologic damage was graded by light microscopy after 72 hours of reperfusion (n = 6). Calcium-calmodulin binding correlated with the severity of delayed histologic damage in various brain regions.

  ".W": "Excessive release of glutamate is thought to play a major role in the susceptibility of neurons to ischemia. In the present study, we evaluated whether differences in the magnitude of glutamate release resulted in some regions being vulnerable to ischemia, but others being spared from irreversible histopathologic damage. Specifically, we compared the temporal profile of ischemia-induced changes in extracellular levels of glutamate in a region selectively vulnerable to 10 minutes of transient ischemia (CA1 sector of the hippocampus) to the changes occurring in regions that, although rendered ischemic, are usually unaffected by a 10-minute insult (i.e., thalamus, cortex, and dorsolateral striatum). In an attempt to correlate the regional changes in glutamate release to the magnitude of the ischemic insult, the degree of ischemia (e.g., ATP depletion, lactate accumulation, and local cerebral blood flow reduction) and the final histopathologic outcome were also evaluated in these regions. Blood flow reduction and energy depletion were severe and uniform in all regions. However, the histopathologic outcome illustrated a different pattern. Although the CA1 sector of the hippocampus was severely damaged, all other brain regions were unaffected by the 10-minute insult. Extracellular glutamate levels, measured by microdialysis, were significantly elevated during ischemia in all four regions. These levels continued to increase during the early recirculation period and gradually returned to baseline by 30 minutes of reperfusion, with a similar temporal changes in all four brain structures. These results, taken with our previous findings, demonstrate that elevated intraischemic glutamate levels are insufficient to independently engender ischemic damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, these drugs are also potent and effective in vivo anticonvulsants. The present experiments compared the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists phencyclidine and MK-801 with the anticonvulsant phenytoin in a model of focal brain ischemia. Fisher F-344 rats were subjected to tandem occlusion of the middle cerebral and ipsilateral common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia. Compounds were administered intravenously 30 minutes and 24 hours after arterial occlusion; infarct size was assessed at 48 hours after occlusion. Phencyclidine had no effect on infarct volume at 1 mg/kg, significantly reduced (by 36%) infarct volume at 3 mg/kg, and produced a nonsignificant 26% decrease at 10 mg/kg. The more potent and selective noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 reduced (by 32%) infarct volume significantly at 0.1 mg/kg, produced a nonsignificant 23% decrease at 0.3 mg/kg, and had no effect at 0.5 mg/kg. Phenytoin, which is not a glutamate antagonist, reduced the infarct volume by 45% at 28 mg/kg. A single dose of phenytoin (28 mg/kg) administered 30 minutes after occlusion was neuroprotective, but delaying drug administration for more than 2 hours was ineffective. These data suggest that blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is effective in reducing the infarct size after focal cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective activity of phenytoin suggests that this may be related to the common anticonvulsant action.\r"

  ".W": "White matter of the mammalian brain is susceptible to anoxic injury, but little is known about the pathophysiology of this process. We studied the mechanisms of anoxic injury in white matter using the isolated rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white-matter tract. Optic nerve function, measured as the area under the compound action potential, rapidly failed when exposed to anoxia. Postanoxic recovery was variable, depending on duration of the anoxic insult; after a standard 60-minute period of anoxia, the compound action potential recovered to 28.5% of control. Irreversible anoxic injury was critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+; maintaining the tissue in zero [Ca2+] solution throughout the anoxic period resulted in 100% compound action potential recovery. Increasing perfusate [Ca2+] during anoxia from zero to 4 mM resulted in progressively less recovery. Anoxic damage to the optic nerve appears to depend on the gradual accumulation (over tens of minutes) of Ca2+ in a cytoplasmic compartment. The inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers Mn2+ (1 mM), Co2+ (1 mM), or La3+ (0.1 mM) had no effect on recovery of the compound action potential after anoxia; only Mg2+ (10 mM) significantly improved recovery. Treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1-10 microM) or nimodipine (1-40 microM) also had no effect on recovery from anoxia. Thus, Ca2+ influx during anoxia does not occur via conventional Ca2+ channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that this Ca2+ influx may occur via other cation channels that are imperfectly selective for Ca2+ or via the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is a net movement of calcium into brain cells during anoxia and ischemia. This communication examines the mechanisms of this movement in rat hippocampal slices by analyzing changes in 45Ca2+ distribution. The CA1 pyramidal cells are the most sensitive to anoxic/ischemic damage; therefore, our measurements of Ca2+ and high-energy nucleotides are restricted to this region. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels during anoxia is not blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker cobalt, nor is it blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists kynurenic acid, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, or ketamine. Kinetic measurements show that the rate of Ca2+ efflux across the plasmalemma during anoxia is sufficiently decreased to account for the increase in intracellular Ca2+. It thus appears that the net increase in calcium does not result from the opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, nor from flux through the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. Rather, it results from inhibition of the adenosine triphosphate-dependent extrusion mechanism for Ca2+. The relation of this conclusion to mechanisms of anoxic cell damage is discussed.\r"

Our observations in these models revealed a pattern of injury that involved some anatomic structures outside the areas of direct ischemic or traumatic insult. Such foci of injury revealed conspicuously abnormal uptake of 45Ca associated with slight or moderate neuronal alteration, whereas severely injured areas showed no 45Ca uptake. Electron microscopic observations revealed a characteristic presence of calcium in swollen dendrites, closely resembling pictures obtained in neuroexcitatory conditions such as epileptic seizures. Abnormal uptake of 45Ca was associated with apparent blood-brain barrier changes characterized by intracytoplasmic uptake of extravasated albumin into the neurons. Protein synthesis assayed by in vivo [3H]leucine incorporation was reduced in regions showing calcium accumulation. Our observations suggest that neuroexcitation may play an important role in development of secondary and chronic changes after ischemic or traumatic brain insults.\r"

Primary cortical neuron cultures were developed from 15-day-old fetuses of both transgenic mice and their normal littermates. Both human copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase and host mouse copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase activities in cultured neurons were identified by native gel electrophoresis followed by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Cultured neurons grown for 10-12 days in vitro were exposed briefly to 0.5 mM glutamate for 5 minutes, followed by biochemical and morphological examinations at 2, 4, and 24 hours. Our data have demonstrated that glutamate neurotoxicity is significantly reduced in transgenic neurons at 2 and 4 hours following exposure to glutamate, as measured by the efflux of lactate dehydrogenase, the 3-O-methyl glucose space, and by phase-contrast and bright-field trypan blue staining. These data indicate that transgenic neurons containing twofold to threefold the normal amount of copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase activity as the result of expression of the human copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase transgene are protected against glutamate neurotoxicity in vitro. Our results suggest that oxidative stress, at least in part, plays an important role in the biochemical pathways amplifying N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity.\r"

U78517F inhibited 200 microM FeCl2-initiated lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates by 50% at a concentration of 0.6 microM compared with 8 microM for U74006F, 28 microM for alpha-tocopherol, and 43 microM for the ring portion of alpha-tocopherol (i.e., trolox). U78517F is devoid of hypothermic or antiexcitotoxic actions or interactions with known neurotransmitter receptors. When administered intraperitoneally to male gerbils at 10 minutes before and again at the end of a 3-hour period of unilateral carotid artery occlusion, U78517F decreased 24-hour postischemic cortical neuronal necrosis. Neuronal density in the medial portion of the cortex was increased from 34.2% of normal in vehicle-treated animals to 86.3% in the U78517F-treated animals. In the lateral cortical area, the vehicle group showed only 3.3% neuronal survival versus 48.2% in the drug-treated group. In a separate series of experiments with the same focal ischemia model, identical dosing with U78517F enhanced the postischemic recovery of cortical extracellular calcium without any effect on ischemic or postischemic cortical blood flow. The effect on calcium recovery was observed at intraperitoneal doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg. The compound also was effective in partially attenuating 1-week postischemic hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss in a gerbil global ischemia model involving brief (15-minute) bilateral carotid occlusion, but sustained dosing was required. These results document the anti-ischemic efficacy of a novel and potent inhibitor of iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation and further support a key role of oxygen radicals in postischemic brain damage.\r"

Platelet-activating factor is produced by cerebellar granule cells in culture and has been extracted from brain tissue. Multiple platelet-activating factor receptors have been demonstrated in brain tissue. Activation of platelet-activating factor receptors in transformed neuronal cell lines involved increases in intracellular calcium. Platelet-activating factor has potent actions on cerebral vessels and cerebral metabolism when administered in vivo, but may not have direct effects on brain microvessels. Excessive platelet-activating factor production in pathological states of the nervous system such as neurotrauma and stroke has been shown in only a few models (e.g., spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion or focal repercussion brain injury). In multiple studies using highly specific and potent platelet-activating factor antagonists, reversal or prevention of key consequences of brain injury such as hypoperfusion following ischemia, reperfusion and edema, inflammatory cell accumulation, neurologic/motor deficits, and neuronal salvage were demonstrated. This review provides and analyzes evidence in support of the role that platelet-activating factor might have in modulation of brain function and pathophysiological processes in brain ischemia and trauma.\r"

Systemic administration of GM1 appears to be efficacious in reducing acute neuronal damage and in facilitating medium- and long-term functional recovery after brain injury. We propose that GM1 protective effects in the acute injury phase results from attenuation of excitotoxicity, whereas the functional recovery seen at longer term could reflect GM1 potentiation of neuronotrophic factors. The potential therapeutic efficacy of GM1 administration in humans is suggested by clinical studies demonstrating improved neurologic outcome in stroke patients.\r"

Bilateral carotid occlusion induced an acute (less than 2 minutes), transient increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine level. After 15 minutes of ischemia, recirculation evoked an immediate (less than 1 minute) increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine concentration that progressed over a 15-minute period. A small rise in spermidine and spermine also was observed. A secondary increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity and the levels of putrescine and spermidine commenced after 6 hours of recirculation. Pretreatment with a-difluoromethylornithine, a specific suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, abolished all early and delayed increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels. This is the first demonstration that both ischemia and postischemic recirculation evoke rapid, transient increases in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase and the levels of polyamines, most notably the ornithine decarboxylase product, putrescine. Our results indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation (by an ischemically induced elevation of extracellular glutamate) is responsible for initiating the early and the delayed stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity. Ornithine decarboxylase activation causes the rapid rise in the levels of putrescine and higher polyamines observed in the acute response to ischemia and the acute and delayed response to postischemic recirculation. These polyamine changes may be involved in the pathophysiology of Ca2+ entry and neuronal death after brain ischemia.\r"

Concentrations of FN from 25 to 100 micrograms per 250 microL of culture consistently depressed phytohemagglutinin (PHA) responses. To exert an inhibitory effect, FN must be present within 20 hours after the addition of PHA to cells, and, therefore, it appears to interfere with early events in the transformation process. Increasing the concentration of PHA failed to reduce the inhibitory effect of FN, which suggests that the depressed response was not the result of FN-PHA complex formation, which would reduce the amount of mitogen available for stimulation. This possibility was supported by the finding that FN also inhibited the mixed lymphocyte response (MLR), in a reaction that was not dependent on the activity of soluble antigen or mitogen. In contrast, the stimulation of lymphocytes to undergo transformation that is induced by the nonlectin mitogen, sodium periodate, was unaffected by FN. Periodate-treated cells are, however, already stimulated to undergo transformation, prior to their exposure to FN. FN did not interfere with the activity of interleukin-2, nor did it indirectly regulate lymphocyte responses by modifying the production and/or effect of humoral regulatory factors released from the adherent accessory cells (macrophages). These studies show that FN is a potent immunosuppressive agent in vitro.\r"

Responses of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were depressed in the presence of a plasma concentration above that required for maximum DNA synthesis, and this concentration must be present in cultures prior to lymphocyte activation. The removal from the plasma of heparin-induced cryoprecipitate, a complex consisting of FN, heparin, and fibrinogen, resulted in a significant reduction in the inhibitory effect of the plasma on the PHA response. Plasma specifically depleted of FN by affinity chromatography on gelatin-agarose beads was 32 percent less inhibitory to the PHA-induced stimulation of cells than untreated plasma; the remaining inhibitory activity in the FN-depleted plasma samples was attributed to the presence of other normal immunosuppressive factors. The inhibitory capacity of FN in plasma was similar to that obtained with purified FN alone, which indicates that, unlike that of other known plasma inhibitors, the immunosuppressive activity of FN was not altered by the presence of other components of plasma. Cryoprecipitate used in the treatment of hemophilia contains high levels of FN, and, as anticipated, PHA-induced lymphocyte transformation was markedly depressed in the presence of solubilized cryoprecipitate. The contribution of FN to the T-cell abnormalities in patients chronically receiving cryoprecipitate and/or factor VIII concentrates derived from cryoprecipitate warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "For 9 months, 38 transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassemia, ranging in age from 3.4 to 19.1 years, were observed for serologic evidence of viral infections, by the collection of serial serum samples. Seventy-six age-matched healthy subjects, two for each patient, were followed as controls. Samples taken at the beginning, middle, and end of the study were tested against 18 viral antigens by complement fixation (CF). In addition, tests for antibodies to HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A virus, and markers for hepatitis B virus were performed. When changes in the antibody titer on CF tests (greater than or equal to 2-fold increase or decrease) or persistently high titers (greater than or equal to 64) were revealed, specific enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for IgM and IgA antibodies were performed concomitant with CF tests in all sera. When symptomatic infections occurred, viral cultures and/or direct detection of antigens were carried out by immunofluorescence methods, EIA, or latex agglutination tests. Thalassemic patients and controls had similar (p greater than 0.05) overall rates of serologically confirmed viral infections (53 versus 132), but the former group had a higher (p less than 0.01) incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (9 versus 4). CMV infections were associated in the thalassemic patients with hepatitis (2 cases), lymphadenitis (2 cases), and upper respiratory tract infection (1 case), while the remaining cases of CMV had a subclinical course. Moreover, the thalassemic patients had a lower (p less than 0.01) incidence of symptomatic infections (27 versus 110) than controls. Therefore, this study showed that both symptomatic and subclinical CMV infections may occur often in thalassemic patients, who otherwise have subclinical viral infections at an overall rate similar to that in healthy subjects.\r"

Seventy-nine blood samples from 68 patients were tested. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) using monospecific reagents and the DPT were performed, and a concentrated ether eluate was tested. The DAT was positive in 62 (78%) of 79 patients and negative in 17 (22%). There is a good correlation among DAT, eluate, and DPT in demonstrating the presence of immunoglobulin on the red cell surface. In contrast, the DPT does not detect C3d and is often negative in cases of AIHA in which C3d alone is demonstrated by the DAT. In DAT-negative cases, DPT results correlated with reactive eluates. However, in four cases of steroid-responsive, DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, the DPT supported the diagnosis of AIHA when the eluate did not react. The DPT is a useful additional screening test for the investigation of AIHA, but it is not recommended as a replacement for either eluate testing or the DAT.\r"

Parentage was not excluded with 23 kinds of standard blood group markers and HLA, but the putative father requested more-affirmative evidence of paternity. Seven kinds of DNA probes that recognize hypervariable loci were applied. On the basis of the allelic frequencies and their confidence intervals previously reported among unrelated Japanese individuals, as well as confirmed codominant segregation of the polymorphism, the exclusion probability and paternity index were calculated for this case. The cumulative paternity index from the seven DNA probes was 1.4 x 10(6), which was 316 times higher than that from the 23 standard blood group markers and HLA. Accordingly, DNA polymorphism is considered to be informative enough for paternity testing.\r"

The leukapheresis product contained 1.5 x 10(10) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and was divided into two aliquots that underwent either automated or manual density gradient separation with ficoll-hypaque and subsequent washing. In the automated process, recovery of MNCs was 85 percent, reduction in platelet content was 64 percent, and the final hematocrit (Hct) was less than 1 percent. The manual separation resulted in 76-percent MNC recovery, a 79-percent reduction in platelet content, and a final Hct of less than 1 percent. The purified MNCs were then placed in methylcellulose culture at a concentration of 4 x 10(5) MNCs per mL. Quadruplicate 1-mL aliquots were cultured, and colonies were counted and classified on Day 14. Comparison of automated and manual ficoll-hypaque separations demonstrated no differences in the total, erythroid, or granulocyte-macrophage colony numbers. The cell processor used is fast, reliable, uncomplicated, and provides a sterile product containing progenitor cells that are not adversely affected by the automated ficoll-hypaque separation.\r"

HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to blood that was subsequently filtered by using different white cell (WBC) filters (cellulose acetate and polyester). The average log reduction of infected cells with polyester filters was at least 2.5 as measured by ID50 titration and polymerase chain reaction. In two WBC filtration experiments with blood from seropositive donors diluted 1:4 with seronegative blood, log reductions of 2.4 and greater than 2.5 were observed. No cell-free virus was retained by the filter used. A freeze-thaw procedure applied to HIV-1-contaminated blood resulted in a minimal log reduction. These results indicate that the reduction of HIV-1 infectivity as a result of filtration is mainly due to the removal of HIV-1-infected WBCs, and that complete removal of infected WBCs cannot be achieved by the current filtration or freeze-thaw procedures. However, the development of filters with enhanced ability to remove (possibly infected) WBCs may have the added benefit of improving the safety of donor blood, especially in multiply transfused patients.\r"

He failed to respond to corticosteroids, multiple plasma exchanges, and cyclophosphamide; he required 54 transfusions in 10 days to maintain a hemoglobin concentration of 6.0 to 10.0 g per dL. He improved dramatically after a splenectomy was performed. The wide-thermal-amplitude cold agglutinin proved to be an IgG1 kappa antibody with Pra specificity. The patient's serum exhibited normal complement activation. When the DAT was carried out at 0 to 4 degrees C, the result was strongly positive for IgG; the indirect antiglobulin test at 0 to 4 degrees C was positive with the patient's serum diluted 1 in 640. Within 6 months, he was in complete remission and receiving no therapy. As compared with eight patients with CAHA that was exclusively IgG-mediated, this patient is remarkable for his requirement for many transfusions and for DATs that were consistently negative for C3d.\r"

  ".U": "91049146\r", 
  ".W": "Present-day whole bladder photodynamic therapy (WBPDT) is cumbersome and time consuming because cystoscopic and ultrasonic manipulations are necessary to position the light emitter within the bladder. More important, WBPDT is inherently unsafe and often ineffective since neither uniform photoirradiation nor accurate light dosimetry can be achieved with the techniques employed to photoirradiate the bladder wall. The intravesical laser catheter (IVLC) eliminates the need for cystoscopy and ultrasonography because passage of the treatment fiber into the catheter's central lumen automatically positions its light-diffusing tip within the center of the bladder. Use of the IVLC delivery system also assures accurate photoirradiation of the bladder wall since inflation of the catheter's balloon transforms the asymmetric bladder into a sphere of known diameter. The light sensor incorporated in the balloon wall provides a method to monitor light fluence and measure total light dose. When provided the parameters of bladder volume, laser energy output, and desired light dose, the computerized control system calculates treatment time and automatically adjusts the period of photoirradiation to compensate for variations in laser light production, energy losses during transmission, and for variations in light intensity resulting from the integrating sphere effect of the bladder wall. This delivery system also increases the safety of WBPDT since the monitor automatically discontinues treatment if any unsafe situation, with respect to light fluence, develops during photoirradiation.\r"

The dissection of the retropubic space helped to form postoperative adherences which fixed the bladder neck and the urethra firmly to the pubic symphysis. The technique is simple, it does not require vaginal surgery, and the incidence of complications is minimal.\r"

In both patients metastatic disease has developed within six months of surgery. LASA demonstrated progressive increase following surgery, most likely due to associated inflammatory reaction.

No occult pulmonary or mediastinal nodal disease was found during initial staging, and none of the patients manifested recurrence of tumor in these sites as a first event. Review of the literature corroborates our finding of a very small thoracic failure rate in early stage seminoma. Routine use of CAT or TOM is not indicated in staging these patients.\r"

In this study of a random sample of noninstitutionalized elderly, 258 self-reported continent and 198 self-reported incontinent women sixty years and older, who participated in a household survey, underwent a clinic evaluation (history, physical examination, and urinalysis); of these 67 continent and 100 incontinent female respondents underwent urodynamic testing. The uroflowmetry, cystometry, and supine static urethral pressure profilometry (UPP) findings did not differ significantly between continent and incontinent subjects (whether based on a self-report or a clinician's diagnosis of urinary continence status). Standing static and dynamic UPP and lateral cystography showed significant differences between self-reported continent and incontinent respondents. The provocative stress test significantly distinguishes continence from incontinence, and stress incontinence from other types. The sensitivity of the provocative stress test was 39.5 percent, whereas its specificity is 98.5 percent. Urodynamic testing including uroflow study, static UPP, and lateral cystography should not be used as a screening test but rather selectively as a confirmatory test, and to determine the therapeutic approach, and to assess the outcome of therapy.\r"

Subcutaneous 3-d murine bladder cancer (MBT-2) in C3H mice were exposed to HESW alone (250 to 1,500 shocks) or in combination with cisplatin (5 to 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Although HESW alone showed no influence on tumor growth, HESW/cisplatin combination therapy suppressed tumor growth more than cisplatin alone. Subsequent studies revealed that an air-fluid interface relative to tumor location played a pivotal role for the chemosensitizing effect of HESW. HESW treatment was able to enhance the cisplatin cytotoxicity only when the tumors were placed adjacent to the air-fluid interface.\r"

The role of transrectal ultrasonography in patients with nonpalpable disease or as a screening tool has yet to be determined.

Pharmacologic treatment using alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists may be used appropriately to manage patients with prostatism who are poor surgical risks but who could benefit from reduced sympathetic tone. In addition, alpha blockers are used to relieve acute retention, and to prevent retention when increased sympathetic discharge is expected. Thus far, nonsurgical therapy aimed at reducing the mechanical obstruction associated with BPH by prostatic size reduction has failed to produce consistent objective improvement. However, several drugs are now being investigated and may be effective for reducing prostatic size in patients with BPH. Clinical trials are complicated by a number of factors, especially very variable symptoms. Moreover, reduction in prostatic size induced by drugs is not permanent and regrowth occurs with drug withdrawal, necessitating chronic treatment. Ideally, future research should be aimed at the prevention of BPH at an early age. However, this presupposes a better understanding of the pathogenesis of BPH. BPH may not be a single, variable disease but a family of diseases with a number of predictable clinical courses. In the future, we should pay particular attention to histologic variability, to see if in fact different pathologic forms of BPH follow different clinical patterns. If urologists are to keep their predominant position in managing the patient with BPH, they will have to keep informed of medical treatment trials and of potential alternative treatment strategies to prostatectomy.\r"

Immunization policies for physician's offices should ensure that all office staff have acquired measles immunity and that a triage policy separating patients with rash from those with other illnesses is utilized.

Systemic hemodynamic variables, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) in the subepicardium and subendocardium, and regional systolic function (systolic segmental shortening) of the area perfused by the circumflex coronary artery (CX) were measured in eight anesthetized dogs. After baseline measurements, the CX coronary artery was occluded with a silk snare and measurements were repeated after 5 minutes of ischemia (occlusion No. 1). The snare was released and 1 hour later the snare occlusion was repeated after placement of a perfusion catheter in the CX coronary artery. After 5 minutes, measurements were repeated (occlusion No. 2). To determine the long-term effectiveness of the catheter, hemodynamic variables and regional function measurements were then obtained every 15 minutes for a total of 60 minutes. During occlusion No. 1, RMBF decreased from 1.30 +/- 0.20 to 0.41 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01), and subendocardial RMBF decreased from 1.44 +/- .24 to 0.34 +/- 0.15 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01). After insertion of the perfusion catheter (occlusion No. 2), subepicardial RMBF was maintained at 0.97 +/- 0.16 and subendocardial RMBF was maintained at 0.78 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1; during occlusion No. 2 subepicardial RMBF was greater (p less than 0.05) than occlusion No. 1 and was not different from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because perfluorochemicals (PFC) can potentially saturate the reticuloendothelial system and decrease carbon clearance as well as cause a transient elevation in liver enzymes, the present study was conducted to determine the lowest effective dose. New Zealand White rabbits (n = 73) were randomly selected prior to infarction to receive 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 ml/kg PFC or an equivalent volume of 5% dextran (control) intravenously. Animals underwent 30 minutes of coronary artery occlusion with PFC or dextran infused over a 30-minute period starting at 20 minutes into the occlusion. Animals were put to death at 24 hours and infarct size was determined histologically and quantitated by computerized planimetry. Neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic myocardium was evaluated semiquantitatively. No hemodynamic differences were noted within groups. Infarct size was similar to that of controls in animals treated with 10 or 15 ml/kg PFC. Significant infarct size reduction, however, was noted in animals treated with 20, 25, and 30 ml/kg PFC versus controls; (p = 0.05, 0.04, and 0.02, respectively). Maximal infarct size reduction was seen with 30 ml/kg PFC (35%). Neutrophil infiltration was significantly decreased in all groups treated with PFC. These results show that intravenous Fluosol-DA significantly reduces infarct size at a minimal dose of 20 ml/kg.\r"

  ".U": "91051176\r", 
  ".W": "There is a marked heterogeneity of myocardial wall thickening within the left ventricle and among different individuals. It is therefore difficult to detect regional myocardial dysfunction from absolute values of systolic wall thickening. We tested whether the extent of left ventricular asynchrony during ischemia and reperfusion can be used to quantify the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction when nonischemic baseline function is not known. In six anesthetized, open-chest dogs regional myocardial wall thickness was measured by means of sonomicrometry under control conditions, at three degrees of ischemic dysfunction (mild, moderate, and severe), and after release of a 15-minute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, when degrees of moderate and mild reperfusion dysfunction similar to the preceding ischemic dysfunction were present. Two indexes of left ventricular asynchrony were calculated: (1) postejection thickening (PET) and (2) the phase difference of the first Fourier harmonic of posterior versus anterior myocardial wall motion (PD). Systolic myocardial wall thickening was decreased from 15.3 +/- 3.1 (standard deviation) % (control value) to 9.7 +/- 1.4% (mild ischemia), 4.2 +/- 1.6% (moderate ischemia), and -3.7 +/- 3.1% (severe ischemia). Conversely PET increased from 0.02 +/- 0.04 mm (control value) to 0.15 +/- 0.22 mm (mild ischemia), 0.19 +/- 0.15 mm (moderate ischemia), and 0.50 +/- 0.26 mm (severe ischemia). PD increased from 9 +/- 28 degrees (control value) to 22 +/- 19 degrees (mild ischemia), 54 +/- 18 degrees (moderate ischemia), and 107 +/- 21 degrees (severe ischemia). After release of the 15-minute left circumflex coronary artery occlusion, PET and PD recovered to 0.34 +/- 0.19 mm and 36 +/- 24 degrees (moderate dysfunction) and 0.25 +/- 0.31 mm and 29 +/- 8 degrees (mild dysfunction), respectively. There were inverse linear relationships between systolic wall thickening and PET (r = -0.86, p less than 0.001) and between systolic wall thickening and PD (r = -0.87, p less than 0.001). Inotropic stimulation by postextrasystolic potentiation increased regional systolic myocardial posterior and anterior wall thickening but did not alter the extent of left ventricular asynchrony. Thus, when normal baseline function is not known, the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction at a given inotropic state can be determined by analysis of left ventricular asynchrony. There was no significant correlation between the extent of PET and PD during ischemia and at early reperfusion and the recovery of contractile function at late reperfusion. Thus PET does not provide a prospective marker for the functional outcome of reperfusion.\r"

Presence of coronary artery disease was defined as more than 50% measured diameter stenosis. Wall motion abnormalities in regions perfused by stenotic vessels were most common in early diastole (76%). Sensitivity of this method at rest in patients with coronary artery disease was 79.7% (p less than 0.0001) and overall accuracy was 84.2% (p less than 0.0001). Abnormalities in both systole and diastole were more common in regions perfused by severe lesions (greater than 75%) than in those perfused by moderately stenotic (less than 75%) vessels (p less than 0.05).

After angioplasty, an intimal tear was identified by angioscopy and ultrasound but it was not seen by angiography. The intravascular ultrasound image showed the tear to extend to the adventitia. In the second case, an apparently smooth intimal surface as imaged by angiography was found by angioscopy and ultrasound to have extensive damage, including subintimal hemorrhage, intimal flaps, and arterial dissection at the angioplasty site.

From January 1987 to December 1988, 149 symptomatic post CABG patients underwent coronary angiography at our institution. Ninety were treated with medical antianginal therapy, 14 had repeat surgery, and 45 underwent PTCA. Complications of repeat CABG included one death, two perioperative myocardial infarctions, and four patients with postoperative supraventricular arrhythmia. PTCA was performed on 42 lesions in 37 native vessels (88% success rate), and on 24 lesions in 23 vein grafts (91.7% success rate). Complications included acute reocclusion (one patient), peripheral artery occlusion (one patient), hematoma formation (one patient), and periprocedure myocardial infarction (one patient). No deaths occurred. At a mean follow-up of 5.9 +/- 3.8 months, 10 patients had recurrent symptoms, six of whom were found to have restenosis. Repeat PTCA was successfully accomplished in four patients; the other two were treated medically. It is concluded that PTCA is a feasible alternative to repeat CABG in selected patients and can be achieved with a high success rate and minimal complications.\r"

In 11 men patients who underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery, a dipyridamole echocardiography stress test was carried out before (1 to 3 days), early after (68 to 130 minutes), and 1 week after surgery. The first and third tests were performed using a standard transthoracic approach, while the second was performed by a transesophageal approach. Dipyridamole was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.56 mg/kg body weight (low dose) and eventually adding 0.28 mg/kg body weight (high dose), always in the absence of antiischemic therapy. An arbitrary wall motion score (0 = eukinesia; 1 = hypokinesia; 2 = akinesia; 3 = dyskinesia) was assigned to the seven different myocardial regions in which the left ventricle was divided in order to have a semiquantitative score. Under basal conditions wall motion score per patient in the three series of tests did not change significantly (1.6, 1.4, and 1.5, respectively), while the mean score during dipyridamole administration showed significant differences (3.6, 1.9, and 1.9, respectively), indicative of the results obtained by surgical repair. The test, positive in all patients before surgery, showed wall motion abnormalities and ischemic ECG changes in two patients immediately after surgery by the transesophageal approach. One patient who had a normal basal contraction pattern and an abnormal response after the test developed in the following days a perioperative myocardial infarction, while a second patient in the follow-up period developed low-level effort angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During exercise, heart rate, a multilead electrocardiogram, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were recorded. The sensitivity and accuracy of the delta ST/delta HR criteria (greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min) were significantly greater than the conventional analysis of ST segment depression criteria (greater than or equal to 0.2 mV) for detecting three-vessel coronary artery disease at a matched specificity of 72% (100% versus 46%, 81% versus 64%, p less than 0.01). A significant linear correlation was found between maximum pulmonary artery wedge pressure increments during exercise (delta PAWP) or Gensini score and the delta ST/delta HR (delta PAWP: r = 0.51, p less than 0.001; Gensini score: r = 0.47, p less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the delta PAWP or Gensini score between patients with three-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min and those with one- or two-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min (delta PAWP: 18.1 +/- 2.0 versus 21.9 +/- 3.3, p = NS; Gensini score: 68.5 +/- 6.6 versus 66.3 +/- 11.3, p = NS). These findings demonstrate that delta ST/delta HR is more useful than a conventional analysis of ST segment depression for identifying not only anatomically severe coronary artery disease but also functionally severe coronary artery disease.\r"

Under control, normoxic conditions, 10 mmol/L PCr significantly increased the action potential duration (measured at 90% of repolarization) in ventricular muscle by 14.6 +/- 3.3 msec and the effective refractory period by 11.5 +/- 3.8 msec (both p less than 0.01). Under ischemic-like conditions (hypoxia, lactic acidosis, elevated [K+]o, zero substrate) PCr had no effect. Phosphocreatinine, a related compound that is not a direct substrate in the creatine kinase reaction, acted similarly to PCr suggesting that alterations induced by PCr did not involve a change in the energy state of cells. However, PCr reduced free [Ca2+]o by nearly 20%, and its electrical effects under normoxic conditions could be largely reversed by a concomitant 20% increase in [Ca2+]o. In Purkinje fibers superfused with low [K+]o-Tyrode's solution to elicit conditions of Ca2+ overload, delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered responses were reversibly inhibited by PCr. These data suggest that the antiarrhythmic effects of PCr in situ may involve prolongation of the effective refractory period in nonischemic tissue or attenuation of membrane changes elicited by Ca2+ overload in ischemic cells. The mechanism by which PCr produces these effects may be related in part to changes in extracellular Ca2+ composition.\r"

  ".W": "The deranged autonomic control of heart rate was studied in 34 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II to III) by examining the carotid sinus baroreflex. The carotid sinus baroreceptors were stimulated by graded suction. The slope of the regression line between increases in cycle length and the degree of neck suction was taken as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. The reflex response is mediated by a selective increase of vagal efferent activity. Baroreflex sensitivity therefore represents a measure of vagal reactivity. Using multiple regression analysis, baroreflex sensitivity (BS) correlated positively to stroke volume index (SVI) and inversely to plasma renin activity (PRA) and to age: BS = 0.47 SVI - 0.38 PRA - 0.23 age + constant (r = 0.74; p less than 0.0005). In addition to digitalis and diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) were given to 16 patients for a mean of 17 +/- 3 days. The patients with hemodynamic improvement (group A) exhibited improved baroreflex sensitivity (1.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.2 msec/mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Baroreflex sensitivity remained unchanged (3.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.4 +/- 1.0 msec/mm Hg; n.s.) in the patients without hemodynamic improvement (group B). The increase in reflex sensitivity did not correlate with hemodynamic alterations. Baroreflex sensitivity during ACE inhibition (BSD) was only related to the baseline baroreflex sensitivity (BSB): BSD = 2.8 BSB - 0.46 (r = 0.84; p less than 0.005). In patients with heart failure, reflex bradycardia decreases with age and with PRA and increases with stroke volume. Chronic therapy with ACE inhibitors enhances vagal reactivity in patients with hemodynamic improvement.\r"

Twenty-five patients received ioxaglate (group 1) and 25 patients received iopamidol (group 2). All patients underwent 48 hours of continuous ECG recording beginning 24 hours before the cardiac catheterization. Left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, peak positive dp/dt, and dp/dt/P ratio were measured immediately before and after left ventriculography and 3 minutes later. Left ventricular systolic pressure did not change after injection of either contrast medium. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased by 30% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and by 22% in group 2 (p less than 0.01) immediately after left ventriculography. A further increase by 45% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and by 24% in group 2 (p less than 0.01) was observed 3 minutes later. No differences were observed between values obtained in the two groups. Peak positive dp/dt did not change immediately after injection of either contrast medium but decreased by 5% (not significant) in group 1 and by 7% (p less than 0.02) in group 2 three minutes after left ventriculography. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Analysis of continuous 48-hour ECGs showed that both ioxaglate and iopamidol induced a slight increase (by 8% and 7%, respectively; p less than 0.05) in heart rate during injection with early and complete recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In prosthetic or paravalvular prosthetic mitral regurgitation, transthoracic color Doppler flow mapping can sometimes fail to detect the regurgitant jet within the left atrium because of the shadowing by the prosthetic valve. To overcome this limitation, we assessed the utility of color Doppler visualization of the flow convergence region (FCR) proximal to the regurgitant orifice in 20 consecutive patients with mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation documented by surgery and cardiac catheterization (13 of 20 patients). In addition, we studied 33 patients with normally functioning mitral prostheses. Doppler studies were performed in the apical, subcostal, and parasternal long-axis views. An FCR was detected in 95% (19 of 20) of patients with prosthetic mitral regurgitation. A jet area in the left atrium was detected in 60% (12 of 20) of patients. In 18 of 19 patients with Doppler-detected FCR, the site of the leak was correctly identified by observing the location of the FCR. A trivial jet area was detected in eight patients with a normally functioning mitral prosthesis; in none was an FCR identified. Thus color Doppler visualization of the FCR proximal to the regurgitant orifice is superior to the jet area in the diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Moreover, FCR permits localization of the site of the leak with good accuracy.\r"

During the subsequent 41-month follow-up (range 10 to 50 months), the yearly cardiac mortality rate was 1.3% in patients with LVH, 2.9% in patients with VPBs, and 8.0% in patients with LVH plus VPBs but only 0.6% when none of these factors was present (p less than 0.05 chi 2 test). The patient groups did not differ with regard to age, time elapsed since operation, underlying valve lesion, and coronary artery disease. Both LVH and VPBs occurred more frequently in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that after aortic valve replacement cardiac mortality is markedly increased in patients with LVH and repetitive VPBs, since they are noninvasive markers of left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The most frequent clinical indications were to investigate the source of emboli, assess valvular regurgitation, and identify valvular vegetations. In 72 patients (82%) TEE significantly influenced management decisions. In selected patients TEE avoided the use of more invasive diagnostic procedures. Adverse effects included occasional premature atrial or ventricular beats (11 patients), sinus bradycardia (six patients), and protracted nausea (one patient). We conclude that in elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases, TEE plays a significant role in the decision-making process without adding a significant risk.\r"

To investigate the change in ventricular size resulting from postural change, seven patients with this malformation were examined. Ventricular volumes were calculated by computed tomography, integrating areas of computed tomographic cross sections measured at 1 cm intervals from the cardiac apex to the aortic arch. In the right lateral position, right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) volumes were no different from those of five control subjects. With a change in the lying position to the left, the increase in the ventricular volume was significantly greater than that in the control subjects (35 +/- 11 versus 3 +/- 3 ml in the right ventricle and 15 +/- 13 versus 3 +/- 8 ml in the left ventricle). The increases in RV and LV end-diastolic pressure, however, were almost the same as those in the 11 control subjects. It is concluded that the cardiac ventricle, especially the right ventricle, dilates significantly with a small increase in preload in patients with congenital absence of the pericardium. It may be a clue for clarifying the ventricular distensibility being freed from physiologic restraint of the pericardium for a long period.\r"

The subjects were divided into three groups: 10 children with no intracardiac shunts, nine children with predominant left-to-right intracardiac shunts, and seven children with predominant right-to-left intracardiac shunts. Positive correlations between impedance and Fick-derived cardiac output determinations were obtained in the non-shunt group (r = 0.84), with lower correlations in the left-to-right shunt group (r = 0.70). In the right-to-left shunt group, the impedance derived cardiac output correlated with Fick pulmonary flow (r = 0.82), but the variability was unacceptably large. Although further study is needed, impedance cardiography appears to have validity as a methodology in pediatric critical care and cardiovascular health research.\r"

  ".W": "Six children with cyanotic congenital heart defects, aged 6 to 60 months, underwent percutaneous balloon angioplasty of a narrowed Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt to improve arterial oxygen saturation. The indication for angioplasty was a cyanotic heart defect not amenable to total surgical correction, either because of the age and size at presentation or because of anatomic complexity, but at the same time requiring palliation of pulmonary oligemia. Following balloon angioplasty, there was an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 71 +/- 8% to 81 +/- 6% (p less than 0.05). In one child with long segment narrowing, there was no significant improvement in oxygen saturation, and this child underwent an additional BT shunt on the contralateral side. On follow-up 3 to 12 months after balloon angioplasty, the oxygen saturations remained improved (78 +/- 10%) in the remaining five patients. In two children with either complete or almost complete blockage of the BT shunt, we were unable to advance any catheter across the shunt but we were able to advance a 2 or 3 mm balloon on a wire and dilate the shunt, followed by introduction of a catheter carrying a larger balloon for angioplasty. This has permitted us to obtain the pulmonary artery pressure directly (this information was of obvious value in patient management) and resulted in an improvement in the arterial oxygen saturation. It is concluded that (1) balloon angioplasty of narrowed BT shunts is feasible, effective, and safe and (2) even completely occluded shunts can be cannulated and the balloon dilated with the newly available balloon-on-wire devices.\r"

A retrospective review was conducted to assess the accuracy of diagnosis, the morbidity and mortality of digoxin intoxication, and its incidence in hospitalized patients with heart failure. We reviewed the medical records of 219 patients discharged with the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication between 1980 and 1988. Patients were classified as follows: (1) Definite intoxication--patients with symptoms and/or arrhythmias suggestive of digoxin intoxication that resolved after discontinuation of digoxin; (2) possible intoxication--patients with symptoms and/or arrhythmias suggestive of digoxin intoxication in the absence of documented resolution after discontinuation of digoxin, or the presence of other clinical illnesses that could possibly account for those findings; (3) no intoxication--patients whose symptoms or ECG abnormalities were clearly explained by other associated clinical illnesses and persisted after withdrawal of digoxin. We identified only 43 patients (20%) with definite intoxication. The majority of patients discharged with the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication (133 or 60%) were classified as possibly digoxin intoxicated, and 43 patients (20%) had no clinical evidence to support this diagnosis. To estimate the incidence of digoxin intoxication, we also reviewed the medical records of 994 patients admitted in 1987 with heart failure. Of these, 563 were receiving digoxin and in 27 the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication was made by their clinicians. Our review showed that only four were definitely intoxicated (0.8%), and the diagnosis could not be excluded in another 16 (4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 5209 participants were also classified by age, cigarette smoking, and antihypertensive treatment at each of four baseline examinations with 8-year follow-up periods. Over the period of follow-up, there were 978 cardiovascular events in men and 836 in women. Risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in general and of CHD in particular was as strongly related to hypertension at all levels of body mass index. This was also found to apply when adjustment was made for possible confounding by cigarette smoking. Age and smoking-adjusted absolute risks of cardiovascular events were found to be higher in hypertensive individuals with high than with low BMIs. Furthermore, the relative risk of cardiovascular disease did not vary significantly with BMI. Thus hypertension is at least as dangerous in obese as in lean persons at all ages in either sex, providing no support for the hypothesis that hypertension in the obese is more benign. This is important, since obesity predisposes to hypertension and most who have hypertension are obese. This report examines the hypothesis for CVD outcomes considered by previous reports and also the subcategories of CVD disease such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and includes data on both men and women and on young and old.\r"

Mean coronary flow velocity at rest was similar (14 +/- 8, 10 +/- 7 cm/sec, p = ns), but was higher during hyperemia for the Judkins-Doppler (41 +/- 8 versus 32 +/- 14 cm/sec, p less than 0.05). Coronary flow velocity reserve, calculated as the ratio of mean velocity at rest to mean velocity following papaverine, was 3.3 +/- 1.4 and 3.7 +/- 1.2 units (p = ns) for the Judkins and intracoronary Doppler techniques, respectively (r = 0.801, p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "Acute renal failure after contrast media injection has been recognized for at least 35 years but the exact mechanism responsible for the renal injury remains an enigma. The clinical characteristics of contrast-induced nephropathy (CAN) are well-known although more recently the nonoliguric presentation has occurred at an increased frequency--in 70 to 90% of cases. For nonoliguric presentation of CAN, one can expect an asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine, the mean peak occurring at 4.2 days. If oliguric, the fractional excretion of sodium will be less than 1% and resistant to either fluid challenge or loop diuretics. Preexisting renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus, increases the risk of CAN 6- to 10-fold but recovery is expected, with less than 10% of all patients requiring dialytic support. Despite the growing body of published reports, the lack of a suitable animal model to evaluate various proposed mechanisms of renal injury has compromised our ability to devise a technique for preventing CAN. A popular scheme has been proposed to describe the possible sequence by which ischemia or nephrotoxins, or both, induce acute renal failure. In particular, a vascular mechanism (i.e., ischemia), is an appealing explanation for CAN since acute changes in renal hemodynamics after contrast media injection have been confirmed by several animal experiments. Unlike other vascular beds in which contrast media induce acute vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation, the initial effect on the renal circulation is acute vasodilatation, followed by progressive vasoconstriction, increasing renal vascular resistance and a concomitant decrease in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lower the chemotoxicity and osmotoxicity of the CM, the less animal toxicity and higher clinical tolerance in humans will be achieved. Nonionic monomers such as iohexol and iopamidol in iodine-equivalent concentrations have approximately half the osmolality and therefore half the osmotoxicity of ionic monomers such as diatrizoate, iodamide, iothalamate and metrizoate. Absence of carboxyl groups in nonionic CM, as opposed to the presence of carboxyl groups in ionic CM, results in a lower chemotoxicity in nonionic CM. Similarly, a larger number of hydroxyl groups in nonionic CM than in ionic CM result in a lower chemotoxicity. The lower chemotoxicity of nonionic CM is reflected as a higher subarachnoid and intravenous tolerance both in animals and in the clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "While ionic contrast media (CM) are stronger anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, both nonionic and ionic CM retard clotting, fibrinopeptide A generation and platelet aggregation (at least by Born-O'Brien aggregometry). Thus, nonionic CM do not cause clots and thrombi. Rather, the driving force for clot or thrombus formation, when it occurs, is blood contact with and activation by the foreign surface of a syringe or catheter itself. A marked enhancement of clotting by glass syringes in comparison to plastic ones supports this view. Blood in any syringe or catheter, therefore, will clot more slowly in the presence of nonionic or ionic CM, the inhibitory effects of the latter being more profound. With respect to models of thrombosis at sites of vascular injury or stenosis, the antithrombotic effects of CM may either be transient owing to the dynamic nature of blood flow (local endothelial cell denudation model), or as in the case of ionic CM, actually to enhance local platelet aggregation (stenosis model). In these situations, preservation of the antithrombotic functions of endothelium with nonionic CM may be quite critical.\r"

  ".W": "The evolution of contrast material for intravascular use has been directed toward the development of better-tolerated agents. Currently, a variety of such \"dyes\" are available for coronary angiography and left ventriculography. Considerable animal and human investigation suggests that significant differences exist between the families of contrast agents that relate to patient tolerance. The newer low osmolality agents (especially the nonionic agents) produce less perturbation of the homeostatic state, which is clinically manifested by a lessened incidence of side effects, including those of a hemodynamic and electrophysiologic nature. While controversy continues over the cost/benefit ratio of the low osmolality contrast agents compared to traditional high osmolality agents, the former are rapidly becoming the community standard for diagnostic and especially therapeutic cardiologic procedures. Accepting the advantages of the low osmolality contrast agents, differences between the ionic dimers and the nonionic agents have been examined. Both experimental and clinical data suggest superiority of the nonionic agents. Although controversy still surrounds the issue of thromboembolism with the nonionic agents, accumulating evidence fails to support a clinically significant relation. The choice of contrast material is the responsibility of the invasive cardiologist. While the benefits of low osmolality agents are most obvious in high-risk patients, experience with large-scale intravenous studies suggests that the choice of contrast agent is a better discriminator of adverse reaction than is preprocedural risk stratification.\r"

  ".W": "Use of an intravenous injection of a water-soluble iodine compound (sodium iodide) for visualizing the urinary tract was first described by Osborne in 1923. However, sodium iodide was accompanied by a high incidence of side effects and the image quality was not good. As newer, improved contrast agents were introduced, a number of investigators reported on the incidence of death and side effects incurred by their use. In 1975, the first large-scale, multicenter, prospective study on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal reactions was reported by Shehadi. In this series, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 5.65%, of which 3.77% were mild, 1.77% were moderate, 0.02% were severe, and 0.0007% were fatal. Shehadi also noted that a history of allergy doubled the risk of adverse reaction and a history of a previous adverse reaction to contrast material trebled the risk; also, the risk of a reaction to an intraarterial injection was half that of the risk associated with an intravenous injection. With the introduction of low osmolar nonionic agents, other large-scale studies were performed because these agents appeared to cause significantly fewer adverse reactions. However, they were from 10 to 15 times more expensive than their predecessors. In 1987, Lasser reported on the increased safety of ionic agents when patients were pretreated with steroids. Palmer in Australia and Katayama in Japan collected 120,000 and 335,000 patients, respectively, and compared the incidence of adverse reactions of the ionic versus the nonionic agents. Wolf recently reported a study that included a direct comparison of ionic agents with pretreatment with steroids versus nonionic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Over the past several decades, there has been an evolution and proliferation of catheterization laboratories. During the latter half of the 1980s, these changes have resulted from the development of a number of catheter-based therapeutic techniques. In general, it would seem reasonable to predict that the 1990s will continue to show expansion of laboratory services in both traditional hospital and nontraditional settings. In the latter, the free-standing laboratories will probably grow substantially. The types of patients studied in this new era will continue to be largely those with suspected or known coronary artery disease. The most dramatic changes in laboratory configuration will be in the image system. High-definition systems will become the standard. Images will be recorded direct to solid-state memory using fluoroscopic techniques. Resolution will be increased at reduced noise and enhanced contrast. Higher resolution video monitors and video recorders will be the cornerstones of the laboratory. The image information for an entire day's work will be stored first on a digital tape system, probably a rapidly accessed reel system, and by the late 1990s in solid-state memory. Individual case data will then be copied to smaller cassettes for patient reports. An entirely digital system will provide rapid electronic acquisition, processing, storage and transmission of information. In addition, physicians will be able to call up previous studies that have been copied to this format for storage. Storage space will be reduced considerably. Access of information will be relatively rapid compared with cine equipment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
