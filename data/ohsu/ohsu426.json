  ".W": "We studied 1,273 patients with ischemic cerebral infarction who were entered into the Stroke Data Bank, a prospective, observational study involving four university hospitals and the Biometry and Field Studies Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Forty patients had noniatrogenic recurrent stroke within 30 days after the index cerebral infarction. Using life tables, the 30-day cumulative +/- SE risk of early recurrence for all infarctions was 3.3 +/- 0.4%. The risk of early recurrence was greatest for atherothrombotic infarction (7.9 +/- 2.2%, eight of 113 patients) and least for lacunar infarction (2.2 +/- 1.2%, eight of 337 patients). Both cardioembolic infarction (4.3 +/- 0.9%, 10 of 246 patients) and infarction of undetermined cause (3.0 +/- 0.5%, 14 of 508 patients) had intermediate risks. History of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as diastolic hypertension and elevated blood sugar concentration at admission, were associated with early recurrence. Logistic regression analysis estimated the risk of early recurrence to be 8.56% in those with coexisting hypertension and a glucose concentration of 300 mg/dl versus 0.77% in the absence of these two abnormalities. Early recurrence was associated with longer median duration of initial hospital stay (27 vs. 14 days) and a higher 30-day case-fatality rate (20% vs. 7.4%). Increased weakness scores were associated with early recurrent stroke. Identification of the determinants of early recurrent stroke may lead to better secondary prevention and may help select high-risk patients for further study.\r"

Symptomatic lacunes presented most commonly as pure motor hemiparesis (31%), aphasia plus right hemiparesis (20%), or sensorimotor dysfunction (11%); none presented as pure sensory stroke. These results suggest that the spectrum of lacunar infarction is more heterogeneous than previously thought. Most lacunes are asymptomatic, and the majority of symptomatic patients do not present with \"classical\" lacunar syndromes.\r"

Postinfarction angina was absent in 19 (group I) and present in 26 (group II). The groups were similar in age, left ventricular function, incidence with which each coronary artery was involved, as well as stenosis diameter (1.0 +/- 0.3 vs 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm [mean +/- standard deviation], respectively, difference not significant), stenosis area (0.9 +/- 0.4 vs 0.8 +/- 0.8 mm2, respectively, difference not significant), percent diameter narrowing (65 +/- 5 vs 66 +/- 9, respectively, difference not significant), and stenosis eccentricity. However, those with postinfarction angina had longer stenoses (group I, 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm; group II, 10.3 +/- 4.0 mm; p less than 0.001). Thus, patients with postinfarction angina and residual anterograde flow in the infarct artery may have angina due to a marked reduction in anterograde flow, caused by a long stenosis. There is no apparent relation between stenosis eccentricity and postinfarction angina.\r"

To assess whether alpha-adrenergic mechanisms play a role in the genesis of ST-ischemic changes in syndrome X, 12 patients with this syndrome (2 men and 10 women, mean age 50 +/- 6 years) underwent exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. They were done off treatment and after alpha blockade with prazosin and clonidine on 2 separate weeks. Despite treatment, all exercise tests remained positive and patients were stopped because of progressive angina pain. Compared to the off-treatment tests, exercise duration and heart rate-blood pressure product at 1 mm of ST-segment depression did not change significantly after prazosin (617 +/- 203 vs 663 +/- 203 seconds and 23,857 +/- 6,125 vs 22,098 +/- 4,816 beats/min X mm Hg, respectively) and clonidine (684 +/- 148 vs 649 +/- 80 seconds and 25,514 +/- 2,386 vs 24,567 +/- 2,001 beats/min X mm Hg, respectively). Ambulatory monitoring showed similar results regarding number of episodes of ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV during control and after prazosin (39 vs 38) or clonidine (26 vs 23) treatment. None of the 8 patients who also underwent provocative testing with phenylephrine had ischemic electrocardiographic changes; only 2 experienced chest pain during the test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89333456\r", 
  ".W": "Thallium-dipyridamole imaging is a very sensitive test for predicting cardiac events after noncardiac surgery, but it lacks specificity. To improve specificity, a semiquantitative scoring system was developed that combined dipyridamole-induced reversible left ventricular dilatation with scintigraphic indexes for severity and extent of reversible perfusion defects. Using this scoring system, patients were classified into low, intermediate and high risk subgroups. Thallium-dipyridamole imaging was performed in 66 patients before major general and vascular surgery. Thirty-nine patients classified as low risk (30 with normal scans and 9 with fixed defects) underwent surgery uneventfully. Surgery was cancelled in 6 patients with extensive thallium redistribution and coronary angiography was performed because of severe coronary artery disease in 5 and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 1. In the remaining 21 patients with thallium redistribution, a positive statistical correlation (p = 0.001) between scintigraphic indexes of severity and extent, and cardiac events was noted. Using cutoff values for the scintigraphic indexes, patients with reversible defects could be classified into intermediate and high risk subgroups. Only 1 of 11 patients at intermediate risk developed a complication, whereas 8 of 10 patients at high risk had a postoperative event (7 deaths and 1 myocardial infarction). Thus, using scintigraphic indexes for severity and extent, patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can safely undergo surgery and a high risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography.\r"

A retrospective study of the prognostic utility of stress-redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy was performed in 190 such patients. A second group of 203 patients with typical angina and a positive exercise electrocardiogram were analyzed for comparative scintigraphic purposes. The cardiac event rate for the 144 negative exercise electrocardiogram patients with normal thallium results was 5 vs 15% in the 46 patients with abnormal thallium results (p = 0.01). These patients were further stratified into high (14 to 18%), intermediate (9%) and low (less than 2%) risk groups for future cardiac events based on combining the thallium results with the percentage of maximal predicted heart rate achieved. A multivariate analysis revealed that an abnormal thallium result was the only significant correlate of future cardiac events. Mechanisms responsible for the discordant finding of a negative exercise electrocardiogram in patients with typical angina include (1) false-positive angina symptomatology in low prevalence coronary artery disease groups in whom the thallium test is negative, and (2) \"electrocardiographically silent\" ischemia in patients in whom the thallium test is positive. These findings reveal that thallium stress-redistribution scintigraphy can be used to stratify 1-year prognosis in this subgroup of patients with typical angina and negative exercise electrocardiograms.\r"

  ".W": "To study the determinants of late restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) performed in patients with unstable angina pectoris, a prospective study was undertaken in 90 patients. Primary PTCA success was achieved in 84 (93%) patients, dilating 116 of 118 coronary narrowings (1.4/patient), while major complications during PTCA occurred in only 1 patient (1 death). Eighty-two patients (114 dilated arteries) were followed for 25 +/- 11 months: 68 (83%) were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II, 11 (13%) in class III, and there were 3 deaths. Late restenosis was found in 16 (25%) of 65 lesions (29% of 49 patients) studied by angiography 9 +/- 7 months after PTCA. Restenosis was more frequent in left anterior descending coronary artery lesions (p = 0.07) and in those which at the time of PTCA had multiple irregularities (67 vs 14%, odds ratio 12.5, p = 0.002), decreased coronary perfusion (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade less than 3) (50 vs 15%, odds ratio 5.7, p = 0.02) or intraluminal thrombus (67 vs 19%, odds ratio 8.7, difference not significant). Multiple irregularities (p = 0.003) and decreased flow (p = 0.02) remained independent predictors of restenosis (goodness of fit 0.88) after adjustment for 12 pre- and peri-PTCA clinical and angiographic variables by logistic regression analysis. These data underline the feasibility of early revascularization by PTCA in patients with unstable angina pectoris. Careful follow-up should be instituted in patients with multiple irregular lesions, decreased coronary perfusion or intraluminal thrombus at the time of PTCA. In such patients, late restenosis may be the rule rather than the exception.\r"

Upright bicycle exercise was performed with the legs first, followed 2 days later by arm testing. Exercise was stopped when typical anginal pain and greater than 1-mm ST horizontal depression occurred during leg testing, and when greater than 1-mm ST horizontal depression was noted during arm testing. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product for leg and arm testing, either at the beginning of anginal pain or at the time when 1-mm ST depression was noted, were similar. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that the L group had higher (p less than 0.01) end-systolic volume at rest and decreased (p less than 0.05) ejection fraction during exercise. Coronary angiography showed that the L group had a greater (p less than 0.001) number of patients with 3-vessel disease, a decreased (p less than 0.001) ejection fraction and less patients with 1-vessel disease. In these patients, absence of anginal pain during arm exercise suggests defective segmental transmission of pain sensation related to severe coronary artery disease. Thus, arm testing, in addition to leg testing, seems to be a simple and useful tool for the detection of severe coronary disease.\r"

This model, derived from the clinical and noninvasive test results of 303 patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, was applied to a group of 425 patients undergoing angiography at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, Hungary (disease prevalence 38%); 200 patients undergoing angiography at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, California (disease prevalence 75%); and 143 such patients from the University Hospitals in Zurich and Basel, Switzerland (disease prevalence 84%). The probabilities that resulted from the application of the Cleveland algorithm were compared with those derived by applying a Bayesian algorithm derived from published medical studies called CADENZA to the same 3 patient test groups. Both algorithms overpredicted the probability of disease at the Hungarian and American centers. Overprediction was more pronounced with the use of CADENZA (average overestimation 16 vs 10% and 11 vs 5%, p less than 0.001). In the Swiss group, the discriminant function underestimated (by 7%) and CADENZA slightly overestimated (by 2%) disease probability. Clinical utility, assessed as the percentage of patients correctly classified, was modestly superior for the new discriminant function as compared with CADENZA in the Hungarian group and similar in the American and Swiss groups. It was concluded that coronary disease probabilities derived from discriminant functions are reliable and clinically useful when applied to patients with chest pain syndromes and intermediate disease prevalence.\r"

  ".W": "To define the independent variables predictive of early versus late mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 420 consecutive patients were studied and divided into 3 groups: the 45 patients who died within the initial 3 months (group 1), the 45 patients who died greater than 3 months and less than or equal to 3 years after AMI (group 2) and the 330 greater than 3-year survivors (group 3). The stepwise logistic discrimination method was applied to clinical and laboratory variables recorded during hospitalization to distinguish among the 3 groups. Six independent variables were found to be predictive of early mortality: left ventricular function score (chi-square 26.2; p less than 0.00001), ventricular fibrillation (chi-square 9.3; p = 0.002), bundle branch block (chi-square 9.0; p = 0.003), history of previous AMI (chi-square 8.7; p = 0.003), age (chi-square 5.8; p = 0.02) and atrioventricular block (chi-square 3.8; p = 0.05). Three independent variables were found predictive of late mortality: age (chi-square 13.8; p = 0.0002), anterior location of the AMI (chi-square 4.0; p = 0.04) and a low peak creatine kinase-MB level (chi-square 3.8; p = 0.05). Only 2 variables were able to distinguish between early and late nonsurvivors: peak creatine kinase-MB level (chi-square 8.7; p = 0.003) and ventricular fibrillation (chi-square 4.6; p = 0.03). Thus, the sets of independent risk factors for early and late mortality after AMI are substantially different--suggesting that differing mechanisms are responsible for outcome.\r"

A further 98 patients with first inferior wall AMI were now studied by body surface mapping on admission to coronary care to confirm that both the spatial distribution or map pattern of ST-segment potentials and the precise measurement of the maxima and minima are of prognostic significance. Each ST-segment map was compared by correlation coefficient to the average map pattern of the 4 groups derived in a previous study and placed in the group with the highest correlation coefficient. Analysis of these groups against outcome confirmed that the group dominated by a large area of marked anterior ST depression was associated with a high rate of complications and a significantly lower survival free of coronary artery bypass grafting (p less than 0.01). Patients in this group had more extensive and severe coronary artery disease than patients in the other groups. Increasing values of maximal ST depression correlated with mortality and complication rates. The extent by which the magnitude of ST-segment depression exceeded the magnitude of ST-segment elevation correlated with mortality and incidence of left ventricular failure. The results confirm the findings of the original study. Body surface mapping is of prognostic significance in inferior wall AMI.\r"

Each of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries was divided into 5-mm long segments and a histologic section was prepared and stained by the Movat method of each of the 6,461 segments in the 129 patients and in the 1,849 segments in the 40 control subjects. In the 129 patients, 35% of the 5-mm segments were narrowed 75 to 100% in cross-sectional area (3% in controls) and the group with unstable angina had the highest percent (48%) of segments severely narrowed compared to the groups with sudden coronary death (36%), acute myocardial infarction (34%) and healed myocardial infarction (31%). Thus, of the 4 subsets of patients with fatal coronary artery disease studied at necropsy, those with unstable angina pectoris had the most severe and extensive coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

After 4 +/- 2.3 drug tests, complete suppression of VT inducibility (defined as less than 6 consecutive beats, mean 1.4 +/- 1.6) was achieved in 86 patients (66%), whereas in 44 patients (34%) nonsustained VTs (greater than or equal to 6 consecutive beats, less than 30 seconds in duration) were still inducible. There was no statistical difference between both groups regarding age, sex, underlying heart disease, ejection fraction or entry arrhythmia. After a mean follow-up period of 19 +/- 17 months, 24 patients (18%) had died, 8 (6%) suddenly. Eight patients (6%) experienced recurrent sustained VT. Symptomatic recurrences (sudden death or VT) occurred in 10 (11%) and 6 patients (13%, difference not significant), respectively. Probability of arrhythmia-free survival was comparable for patients with 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15 and 16 to 32 inducible ventricular complexes with discharge medication. The negative predictive value of electropharmacologic drug testing was about 89%, irrespective of the maximal number of inducible complexes used for the definition of a negative test result. It is therefore concluded that conversion of sustained into nonsustained VT during therapy assessment by programmed ventricular stimulation indicates a positive drug effect.\r"

A minimum of 12 and a maximum of 26 consecutive episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal AF were recorded from the 8 patients during 66 to 332 days. Methods developed in industrial reliability theory were used to show that, for the overall group of 8 patients, the interevent times between successive occurrences of symptomatic AF were not independent. However, for a subgroup including 6 of the patients, the interevent times were independent and governed by an exponential probability distribution. Differences in observed behavior of symptomatic AF may relate to differences in underlying mechanism within patients.\r"

The subjects underwent graded treadmill testing while taking pindolol (a beta blocker with ISA), propranolol (a beta blocker without ISA) and placebo, in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2), cardiac output and stroke volume were determined at 25, 45, 60 and 75% of each subject's VO2 max. Heart rate was significantly lower with pindolol compared with placebo at all stages of exercise, but significantly higher compared with propranolol at all stages of exercise except at 75% of VO2 max and at VO2 max (no significant differences between the 2 beta blockers were recorded at these stages). Mean arterial pressure was statistically equivalent with pindolol and propranolol at all stages of exercise and significantly lower while beta-blocked compared with placebo conditions at 45, 60 and 75% of VO2 max. Cardiac output and VO2 were statistically equivalent across all 3 treatments at all submaximal levels of exercise. It was concluded that, although heart rate was significantly higher with pindolol compared with propranolol at the 3 lower rates of work, cardiac output and VO2 were not different between the drugs, thus making little impact on exercise performance.\r"

Patients underwent weekly BP evaluations for 1 month to ensure that they had persistently elevated BP and then completed a maximal treadmill exercise test to exclude those with overt coronary artery disease. The low- and moderate-intensity groups trained at 53 and 73% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), respectively; however, total caloric expenditure per week was similar in both groups. VO2 max did not increase in the low-intensity group with training, but increased 28% in the moderate-intensity group. Diastolic BP decreased 11 to 12 mm Hg in both training groups. Systolic BP decreased 20 mm Hg in the low-intensity group with training, which was significantly greater than the change in the control and the moderate-intensity groups. Although systolic BP decreased 8 mm Hg in the moderate-intensity training group, this reduction was not significant. Training resulted in a somewhat lower cardiac output at rest in the low-intensity group, whereas total peripheral resistance decreased slightly in the moderate-intensity training group. Plasma and blood volumes, plasma renin levels and urinary sodium excretion did not change in either group with training. Both groups manifested lower plasma norepinephrine levels after training during standing rest, but not while supine. Thus, low-intensity training may lower BP as much or more than moderate-intensity training in older persons with essential hypertension, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear.\r"

Of the 71 conduits studied, 19 were aortic and 52 were pulmonary homograft valved conduits. Two aortic homograft valved conduits were inserted in the aortic position, whereas all remaining homografts were placed in the pulmonary position. On the immediate postoperative echocardiogram, 25 (35%) of the conduit valves had no regurgitation and 44 (62%) had 1+ (mild) regurgitation. Two pulmonary valved conduits (3%) in the pulmonary position had 2+ (moderate) regurgitation and right ventricular dimensions greater than 95% for body surface area. The peak velocity across the homograft valve was normal (less than 1.3 m/s) in 58 valves (82%). In the remaining 13 valves, peak velocity ranged from 1.4 to 2.6 m/s. No homograft valve had a peak velocity greater than 2.6 m/s in the immediate postoperative period. To assess the fate of homograft valved conduits in the intermediate-term follow-up period, 38 children with 38 conduits had a repeat echocardiogram at 6 to 25 months (mean 15 +/- 6) after surgery. Of the 38 conduits examined, 10 (26%) had no regurgitation, 25 (66%) had 1+ regurgitation and 3 (8%) had 2+ regurgitation. Progression of the amount of regurgitation occurred in 11 (29%) patients. At the follow-up examination, peak velocity was less than or equal to 1.4 m/s across 34 conduit valves, between 1.4 and 2.6 m/s across 3 valves and greater than 2.6 m/s across 1 valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The left ventricle was studied noninvasively by means of echocardiography, whereas the distribution of body fat was determined by computed tomography. The end-diastolic left ventricular dimension and stroke volume were greater in obese patients than in non-obese control subjects. Not only the absolute values of these parameters, but also the diastolic left ventricular dimension index (calculated as end-diastolic dimension/cube root of body surface area) and stroke index were greater in obese patients. When the obese patients were divided into 2 groups according to the intraabdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio (V/S) determined by computed tomography, the diastolic dimension index and the stroke index were significantly greater in visceral-type obesity (V/S greater than or equal to 0.4) than in subcutaneous-type obesity (V/S less than 0.4) (43.2 +/- 2.9 vs 40.3 +/- 3.1 mm/m2/3, p less than 0.01 and 49.3 +/- 6.1 vs 40.3 +/- 5.6 ml/m2, respectively). Multiple regression analysis with independent variables of age, body weight, duration of obesity and V/S ratio showed that diastolic dimension index and stroke index significantly correlated with the V/S ratio. Thus, the alteration of cardiac function in obese patients is attributable not only to excess body weight and duration of obesity but also to intraabdominal fat accumulation.\r"

Its influence on color Doppler imaging was evaluated in a flow model study and in a clinical study. In the flow model, increasing attenuation (up to 11.4 dB/MHz) impaired the signal to noise ratio and decreased the sensitivity for detecting flow velocities. Thus, flow signals were obtained with flow velocities greater than 3 cm/s (0.1 dB/MHz), greater than 9 cm/s (5.7 dB/MHz) and greater than 17 cm/s (11.4 dB/MHz). After injection of SH U 454 (200 mg/ml), velocities down to 3 cm/s were detected even with high attenuation (11.4 dB/MHz). Color Doppler imaging was performed before and after intravenous injection of 2 ml, 3 ml and 4 ml of SH U 454 (200 mg/ml) in 22 adult patients, and the maximal color-coded areas of diastolic blood flow were determined in the right atrium and ventricle. In 19 of 22 patients, the displayed color-coded areas increased after injection of SH U 454. The diastolic blood flow was imaged on 14 +/- 8% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) of the cross-sectional area of the right ventricle (4-chamber view) without SH U 454, compared with 39 +/- 15% with 3 ml of SH U 454 (p less than 0.001). For the right atrium, the area displayed by color Doppler increased from 9 +/- 13 to 62 +/- 25% (p less than 0.001). The variability of the measurements from patient to patient after injection of SH U 454 was 5.9 +/- 4% as compared with 10.7 +/- 6.9% without SH U 454 (p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that the intravenous injection of SH U 454 increases the sensitivity of color Doppler imaging for detection of blood flow by improving the signal to noise ratio.\r"

Radii to the systolic and diastolic boundaries of the right anterior oblique ventriculogram were measured at 18 degrees intervals; isointegral voltages were tabulated for early and late halves of the QRS complex at 35 definitive electrode sites. Multivariate analysis showed all ray lengths depended on all 70 voltage values. Linear transformation matrices to predict ray length from voltage distribution were calculated for a training set which was successively expanded from 80 to 160 at increments of 20 patients. Training set expansion led to a progressive decrease in the error of reproduction of the ray lengths for patients outside the training set. There is a strong relation between ventriculographic contours in patients with coronary artery disease and body surface potential values during early and late QRS complexes. Even in simplified linear formulation, the relation is detectable throughout a large population despite interindividual variations in anatomic geometry.\r"

Preliminary experimental and clinical studies support this possibility and suggest that the multipolar content of QRST area distributions on the body surface is a marker of vulnerability.\r"

Studies of children and young adults in the Bogalusa Heart Study have provided evidence that might account for this race-gender contrast. A variety of anthropometric and metabolic parameters influencing serum lipid and lipoprotein levels places white boys and young white men selectively at high risk for the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Obesity and greater central body fat, subtle aberrations in carbohydrate-lipid metabolic relations and variability in sex hormone profiles appear to underlie a trend to adverse lipoprotein changes in white men. A lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and apolipoprotein A-l at puberty and a dramatic increase of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are seen in young white men; such adverse changes identify them to be at greater risk. It is noteworthy that children whose fathers had myocardial infarction tend to be white. These children also have relatively high ratios of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-l and apolipoprotein B/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Studies of risk factors in children emphasize their importance in the early natural history of coronary artery disease. These findings show the need for beginning prevention of adult heart disease in childhood.\r"

I131-albumin was injected into the jugular vein of controls or into the left renal artery or in retrograde manner into the left ureter of female dogs. Experimental groups included those with no obstruction, occlusion of left renal veins or left renal lymphatics, or both. Collections were made from the right femoral artery, both renal veins, thoracic duct and both ureters at frequent intervals for 2 to 4 hours. Data analysis included I131 concentration, specific activity, rate of recovery and selected ratios. After renal arterial injection, the percentage of I131 recovered in thoracic duct lymph of dogs without renal venous obstruction was 5 to 10 times that recovered in those that received injections into the jugular vein. In dogs with renal venous obstruction, recovery from the thoracic duct was 10 to 1,000 times that in control dogs. Most of the differences occurred during the first hour, after which time as recirculation and redistribution occurred the rates of appearance in thoracic duct lymph in each group were similar. The differences in the ratios of concentration in thoracic duct lymph to concentration in femoral arterial blood were also much greater when the renal vein was obstructed than in dogs with no obstruction. The greater return of albumin through the thoracic duct in those with impeded renal venous outflow was probably related to both sequestered concentration and increased intrarenal pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fat-free mass (FFM) and percent body fat (%BF) were obtained from densitometry. The resistance of the whole body was determined almost entirely by the resistances of the arm and the leg. The accuracy of the prediction of FFM from arm length2/arm resistance and of %BF from weight x arm resistance/arm length2 was only marginally less than that obtained by using whole-body measurements. Thus, measurements of the resistance and length of the arm can be used in place of the whole-body methods for estimating body composition from bioelectric impedance.\r"

Daily measurement of nitrogen excretion is usually included in the calculation of EE, dCH, and dF but it is difficult to perform in the clinical setting and is not necessary for accurate determination of EE. In this paper new equations, which are suitable for use with critically ill patients, are given for calculating EE, dCH, and dF without N-excretion measurements. With these equations the maximum errors for EE, dCH, and dF were 56, 179, and 306 kcal/d, respectively. The mean errors in 38 measurements of 26 critically ill patients were 27, 86, and 143 kcal/d, respectively. Measurement of EE by these equations is very accurate and suitable for both research and clinical use. Although the calculation of dCH and dF is much less precise, it can still given an indication of fuel utilization.\r"

The roles of lipid, carbohydrate, and caloric load on the inhibition of pancreatic secretions by jejunal infusion of nutrients was investigated in six other healthy volunteers. Carbohydrate, lipid, and the mixed meal inhibited pancreatic secretions whereas the carbohydrate solution was the only one that inhibited biliary secretion. These studies indicate that the mechanism of jejunal brake seems mainly related to the jejunal caloric load. In malabsorption or in the short bowel syndrome, a high caloric load or unabsorbed nutrients in the jejunum further inhibits pancreatic secretion, contributing to the loss of nutrients from the intestinal tract.\r"

Meals eaten with others contained more carbohydrate, fat, protein, and total calories; had smaller deprivation ratios; and had larger satiety ratios than meals eaten alone. The number of people present was positively correlated with meal size even when meals eaten alone were excluded. Adding the number of people present as a factor in a multiple-regression prediction of meal size more than doubled the variance accounted for, without altering the influence of other predictors, suggesting that social factors are associated independently with an increase in meal size. Meal size was positively correlated with the postmeal interval for meals eaten alone but not for meals eaten with other people. This suggests that social factors increase amounts eaten and disrupt postprandial regulation.\r"

Eighty-seven adults varying widely in body composition (range: 8.8-59.0% body fat) underwent measurement of bioelectrical impedance and underwater weighing (density). Fat-free mass determined from density (FFMd) was compared with FFM estimated from bioelectric impedance according to previously published regression equations. Correlation coefficients were high at all levels of body fat (0.94-0.99) but impedance equations overestimated FFM compared with FFMd in subjects greater than 42% body fat. This effect was greatest in subjects greater than 48% body fat and a regression equation was derived for determination of FFM for these subjects. These data confirm the excellent agreement between body composition determined from bioelectrical impedance and density but suggest that caution should be used in applying existing regression equations to very obese subjects.\r"

Mean breast-milk output ranged from 682 to 744 g/d in the age period of 2 wk to 7 mo. There was no difference in milk output between the two experimental groups. In all cohorts, breast-feeding frequency influenced milk output positively. Only at age 18-22 wk did the mothers' prepregnancy or 4-wk postpartum body mass index play an additional role. The results confirm that breast-milk output of mildly undernourished women is comparable with that of well-nourished women. Short-term energy supplementation during pregnancy did not increase breast-milk output, probably because the sample studied was not at nutritional risk.\r"

The LOV diet had a significantly greater cholesterol-lowering effect than did the LM diet (10% vs 5% decrease) but blood pressure reductions were similar.

The proportion of saturated fatty acids was highest in the perirenal adipose tissue and lowest in buttock adipose tissue. The proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids in the three sites were in the reverse order. Linoleic and linolenic acids were similar in the three adipose-tissue sites, an important finding for those concerned about the essential fatty acids, which are solely derived from the diet. The results clearly show that the fatty acid composition of the two subcutaneous fat depots differ significantly. We conclude that abdominal fat is more saturated than buttock fat.\r"

After correcting for potential confounding variables, reduction of a measure of dietary cholesterol and saturated fatty acids assessed by two simple questions was a significant independent predictor of reduction in total cholesterol in serum (p less than 0.005). Initial body mass index (BMI) and change in BMI were highly significant predictors of initial values and changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol in serum. Reduction of dietary saturated fatty acid and cholesterol was significantly correlated with initial serum cholesterol levels, which suggest that serum cholesterol screening may be an important motivating factor for dietary change. Important public health and research implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

In adults plasma carnitine concentration and urinary carnitine excretion of strict vegetarians and lactoovovegetarians were significantly lower than those in the mixed-diet group but were not different from each other. In children significant differences were found between all three diet groups for both plasma carnitine concentration and urinary carnitine excretion. The differences in plasma carnitine concentrations were greater in children than in adults, possibly reflecting the effects of growth and tissue deposition. Small differences between diet groups in adults do not suggest a nutritionally significant difference in carnitine status.

The fat supplement (987 +/- 55 kcal/d) did not alter 24-h energy expenditure (2783 +/- 232 vs 2820 +/- 284 kcal/d) and failed to promote the use of fat as a metabolic fuel (fat oxidation 1032 +/- 205 vs 1042 +/- 205 kcal/d). The overall energy balance was closely correlated with the fat balance (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001) but not with the carbohydrate balance (r = -0.12, NS). These data indicate that substantial imbalances between intake and oxidation are much more likely for fat than for carbohydrate.\r"

The serum levels of vitamin A in the diabetic patients as well as in the control subjects showed a significant linear regression with serum concentrations of RBP. Unlike vitamin A, serum concentrations of vitamin E were not significantly different between the two groups of subjects. These findings suggest that the reduced serum vitamin A levels in the diabetic patients reflect reduced mobilization of vitamin A from the liver.\r"

Multiple-regression analysis was used to adjust for effects of age, gender, indices of the protein nutritional status, and infections. Retinol was significantly associated with hematocrit, serum Fe, transferrin, ferritin, and saturation of transferrin (%ST). To obtain further evidence as to whether this observed association is a causal one, an intervention trial was carried out. After collection of the baseline data of 300 children, 166 children with a hemoglobin concentration less than 7.5 mmol/L were selected. A random sub-sample of 78 children received vitamin A capsules; the other children served as control subjects. Two months after supplementation significant differences, adjusted for age, were found for retinol, retinol-binding protein, serum Fe, and %ST between the supplemented and the control group. After 4 mo none of the indices were found to be significantly different between the supplemented and the control group. Periodic massive doses of vitamin A may play a role in improving the Fe status as well.\r"

Vitamin B-6 intakes were determined from 3-d diet records; supplementation was based on self-reported brand and frequency data. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for PLP. Subjects were primarily low-income Caucasians. There was no linear relationship between dietary vitamin B-6 intake, age, sex or health status, and PLP while accounting for supplemental vitamin B-6 use. PLP, however, was negatively correlated with age (p less than 0.001) in individuals with PLP values between 32 and 90 nmol/L. Vitamin B-6 status was low (PLP less than 32 nmol/L) in 32% of this elderly population (n = 198) and could be attributed to low dietary vitamin B-6 intakes and/or the presence of health problems reported to alter vitamin B-6 status. This research suggests that low vitamin B-6 status is prevalent in low-income, elderly persons, especially those with multiple health problems.\r"

Vitamin E deficiency enhanced the antimalarial action of QHS against Plasmodium yoelii, both in terms of decreased parasitemia and improved survival but Se deficiency did not. A vitamin E-deficient diet containing 5% cod-liver oil had such strong antimalarial activity in itself that no additional therapeutic benefit of QHS could be demonstrated. Hematocrit values in parasitized mice treated with QHS or fed the cod-liver-oil-supplemented, vitamin E-deficient diet were normal. Nutritional manipulation of host antioxidant status may provide a promising prophylactic and/or therapeutic tool for the control of malaria.\r"

Serum folate declined with aging; however, neither the total folate level nor the distribution of hepatic folate coenzymes was affected by the aging process. The level of liver folate monoglutamates was not significantly different in any group. The initial rate of uptake of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu was significantly decreased in hepatocytes from the 24-mo-old rats, as was the ability to concentrate this folate from the medium. Aged rats maintain apparently normal levels of hepatic folates despite decreased serum levels and decreased ability to take up folates, suggesting that membrane transport of folates may not be a limiting factor in hepatic folate assimilation.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups (A and B), both receiving a diet from which tryptophan, Zn, and niacin were excluded. Patients in group B, however, received 220 mg Zn sulfate orally. Upon admission the pellagra patients had low plasma Zn levels and low urinary excretion values of N'methylnicotinamide (N'MN) and N'methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-PYR) in relation to the control subjects (p less than 0.01). During the experimental period there was an increase in plasma Zn levels (p less than 0.005) and in urinary N'MN (p less than 0.05) and 2-PYR (p less than 0.05) excretion in the patients receiving Zn supplementation (group B).

Based on a cutoff point of 2.02 for AST-AC, approximately 9% of the elderly people not using vitamin B-6 supplements had a marginal vitamin B-6 status. About 7% were using vitamin B-6 supplements. Dietary intake of vitamin B-6 per gram protein was negatively related to AST-AC. Vitamin B-6 intakes per gram protein higher than 0.020 mg were necessary to ensure an AST-AC value less than 2.02.

Examination of 76 primary and 4 metastatic lung carcinomas in primary lung carcinoma KP16D3 showed immunohistochemical positivity only to mucin-nonproducing papillary adenocarcinoma (27/28) and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (2/2), except for one case of large cell carcinoma. All other primary lung carcinomas such as squamous cell carcinoma, acinar adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma had negative results. From these findings, KP16D3 seems to be an effective immunohistochemical marker of mucin-nonproducing papillary adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung and it appears to be useful to investigate both the histogenesis and functional expression of primary lung adenocarcinoma.\r"

The discrepancy in the immunofluorescence findings resulted from the cross-reactivity of the polyclonal anti-HBcAg antiserum because it contains both anti-HBcAg and anti-HBeAg activities. Mesangial deposits of HBsAg were detected in 40% and 21% of renal biopsies from HBsAg carriers with mesangial IgA nephropathy by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The authors' study confirms that HBeAg is the predominant HBV antigen deposited in HBV-associated membranous nephropathy, and glomerular HBsAg deposits are detected in some HBsAg carrier with mesangial IgA nephropathy. Careful testing and evaluation of each antibody are necessary to prevent misinterpretation.\r"

Three of these cases were also studied with frozen tissue sections. The biotinylated probe readily detected calcitonin messenger RNA (mRNA) in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue section within 24 hours. Northern hybridization and other control studies demonstrated the specificity of the calcitonin probe. Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes for other mRNAs present in high abundance such as adrenocorticotroipic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and growth hormone also detected the respective mRNAs in pituitary tissues. These result show that biotinylated oligonucleotide cDNA probes can be used to detect specific mRNAs present in large amounts in some endocrine cells and tumors by ISH. This approach offers an alternative that does not require the use of molecular cloning or radioactive probes for this investigative and diagnostic technique.\r"

A missing sex chromosome was also observed in four of the ANLL-M2 patients but not in the three M1 patients. An increased number of dyspoietic myeloid cells and/or basophils was present in four patients in day 14 or 21 marrows after induction therapy, but this feature did not appear to adversely affect prognosis. Previous reports have stated that t(8;21) occurs almost exclusively in ANLL-M2. However, by revised French-American-British criteria for classification of ANLL, the M1 subtype may also be observed with significant frequency.\r"

The assay was validated and gave reproducible results over a wide range of absorbance values. The sensitivity of the assay for THP was 2-5 micrograms/L, the coefficient of variation between assays 7.5%, and the day-to-day variability 11.1% for THP concentrations between 6.25 and 200 micrograms/L.

The authors have capitalized on this feature to directly and simultaneously measure the absolute numbers of all lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes per microliter of peripheral blood. The study group consisted of 42 hospital patients, 12 former blood donors seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 12 HIV-seronegative donors. Regression analysis revealed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.97) between Spectrum lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte counts determined by a Coulter Counter S-Plus IV. Similarly, Spectrum CD4 cell counts were significantly correlated (r = 0.98) with CD4 cell counts calculated from the Coulter lymphocyte counts and % CD4+ lymphocytes determined by flow cytometry. These findings indicate that the absolute numbers of lymphocytes and subsets of lymphocytes in peripheral blood can be rapidly and simultaneously measured by flow cytometry. Such an assay should prove useful in studies of HIV infection, where total lymphocyte and CD4 cell levels are important parameters for clinical staging and assessing responses to treatment.\r"

It is important for clinical coagulation laboratories to measure protein C. For this purpose, a simple functional assay is needed. This article describes an automated assay for functional protein C with activation by copperhead venom. The authors have automated this assay for a centrifugal analyzer (COBAS Bio) and have proved the specificity of the assay by comparing values obtained amidolytically with those obtained with a radioimmunoassay for protein C.\r"

  ".W": "Patients on chronic hemodialysis who are treated with reusable dialyzers sterilized with formaldehyde are known to have antibodies develop with N-like specificity. These sera have been shown to also react with formaldehyde-treated N-negative cells. This latter specificity has been referred to as antiformaldehyde (anti-Form). Because anti-Form develops presumably in response to formaldehyde-treated cells that gain access to the patient's circulation, the authors reasoned that recipient anti-Form once established might be capable of binding to cells exposed to formaldehyde during dialysis, resulting in a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) result and an eluate reacting only with formaldehyde-treated reagent cells. The authors studied 96 patients on chronic hemodialysis who were exposed to formaldehyde-sterilized equipment. Both anti-N-like and anti-Form specificities were found. Anti-Form was detected in the serum of 16% of patients when tested against 0.37% (w/v) formaldehyde-treated cells. Nineteen percent of patients demonstrated a positive DAT result. The presence of a positive DAT result was significantly associated with the presence of anti-Form in the patient's serum (P less than 0.05). Red blood cell eluates from two patients with a positive IgG DAT result and serum anti-Form demonstrated anti-Form in the eluate. Increasing the concentration of formaldehyde treatment of red blood cells resulted in increasing strength of reactions with anti-Form serum, suggesting that the sensitivity of serum and eluate testing could be modified by the method of cell preparation. As expected, the reactivity of anti-Form with formaldehyde-treated cells could not be neutralized by formaldehyde. The authors conclude that patients treated with formaldehyde-sterilized reusable dialysis equipment may on occasion have a positive DAT result and have an eluate that is nonreactive with the use of standard reagent cells but reactive with formaldehyde-treated cells.\r"

However, this technique is cumbersome for analysis of multiple samples. In order to simplify detection of HDV RNA, the authors have tested a spot-hybridization method with a new HDV cDNA probe. Their method has proved to be rapid, sensitive, and specific for HDV RNA even when less ultracentrifugation was used for recovering serum RNA. Results for HDV RNA were concordant by both spot and Northern blot hybridization in 12 serum samples from patients with known delta hepatitis, whereas in seven cases spot-hybridization was superior in detecting liver HDV RNA. The concordance between HDV RNA by spot hybridization and delta antigen was complete, whereas that between delta IgM (44% overall) or IgG (67% overall) was less strong. The authors' observations indicate that this new technology permits detection of HDV RNA with relative ease and could be applicable to the evaluation of large numbers of cases with delta hepatitis.\r"

Evidence for the diagnosis was provided by Warthin-Starry stain and electron microscopic demonstration of the presumed CSD bacillus. Empiric treatment with antibiotics brought about clinical improvement. This case demonstrates the altered lymph node pathologic characteristics with CSD that may occur in a patient with AIDS.\r"

We studied 86 infants who were born to women with a history of cocaine and/or heroin use during pregnancy. The newborns were observed over a 5-day hospital period using a standardized abstinence scoring system and urine drug screening of both mother and infant. Of these, 35 had maternal and/or newborn urine test results that were positive for cocaine only (cocaine group), 14 that were positive for heroin only (heroin group), 17 that were positive for both cocaine and heroin (cocaine/heroin group), and 20 that were negative for both, although the mothers admitted to cocaine use during their pregnancy (cocaine history group). In approximately half of the mother/infant pairs, the results of the urine drug tests were discordant. Microcephaly and growth retardation occurred most frequently in the infants in the cocaine group (17% and 27%, respectively). Microcephaly was also found to be significant in the infants in the cocaine/heroin group. Signs of drug withdrawal occurred in all four drug-exposed groups. Mild withdrawal occurred in 26% of infants in the cocaine group, 21% of the infants in the heroin group, 47% of the infants in the cocaine/heroin group, and in 30% of the infants in the cocaine history group. Withdrawal requiring treatment occurred in 6% of the infants in the cocaine group, 14% of the infants in the heroin group, 35% of infants in the cocaine/heroin group, and 5% of the infants in the cocaine history group. The use of heroin with cocaine has a synergistic effect on the behavior of the newborn.\r"

This study examined, among male and female adolescents, which beliefs about condoms are associated with intentions to use them if they have coitus in the next year. Teenagers attending adolescent health clinics completed self-administered surveys. Although most adolescents knew that condoms prevent sexually transmitted diseases, an increasing belief in the preventive effects of condoms was not associated with an increased motivation to use them. Instead, other immediate, short-term consequences, such as the ease with which they can be used and discomfort associated with their use, were most strongly associated with adolescents' intentions to use condoms. To encourage condom use, messages from physicians and other health care professionals must focus on adolescents' beliefs that are most likely to encourage or inhibit use of condoms. Health considerations should not be the sole emphasis of such communications if the goal is to increase the use of condoms among sexually active adolescents.\r"

Community leaders attempting to recruit health care providers and pediatricians considering locating their practice in a specific community need a method by which they can evaluate a community's potential for supporting a new primary care practice. A detailed survey was conducted in early 1988 of pediatric practices geographically dispersed throughout the state of Oklahoma. Data collected from the physicians and their administrative staff reflected the volume of office and hospital visits and practice costs over the prior 12 months. Using the capital costs and direct operating cost data with information obtained on the number of patient visits and revenue generated collected in this survey, we designed a model to project the economic feasibility of establishing a pediatric practice in a specific community. This model can be used to project the number of annual pediatric primary care visits a community can generate, the direct and indirect costs to establish and maintain a clinic, and the gross revenue and net income of the practice.\r"

The following four factors bear directly on the present and future status of the office-based pediatric practice: (1) size of the office-based pediatrician population, (2) size of the pediatric patient population, (3) the frequency of patient visits, and (4) the pediatric market share. Results indicate that the pediatricians' market share of young children has continued to grow. However, the pediatricians' share of young children has not grown fast enough to offset an increase in the pediatrician population. Continued growth of the pediatric practice may depend on developing effective marketing strategies and providing more primary care to the adolescent population.\r"

Despite the absence of a clinical vomiting history in 14 of 16 patients with ALTE, the incidence of GER was similar in both groups (patients with ALTE vs control subjects, 95% vs 100%). Significant arterial oxygen desaturation (less than 90% for greater than 3 minutes) was monitored during 60 episodes in 14 of 16 infants with ALTE, compared with no episodes of reduced arterial oxygen saturation in control subjects. Fifty-four of 60 of these desaturation events commenced within 3.9 +/- 0.4 minutes (mean +/- SD) of onset of a drop in esophageal pH to less than 4.0. Linear regression analysis indicates a significant correlation between duration of esophageal acidification and length of individual hypoxemic episodes (r = .39). Pneumocardiograms were normal in all patients. These data suggest that unsuspected GER is common in infants presenting with ALTE and, in these patients, GER may be directly associated with reflex hypoxemic episodes. Prolonged intraesophageal pH monitoring, performed simultaneously with evaluation for apnea, should be considered in all infants presenting with ALTE.\r"

Pilot studies within 96 families showed that parents' concerns about their children's development took the form of value judgments, could be classified into commonly accepted developmental domains, and related to performance on screening tests. In our study, 100 families seeking pediatric care were asked to list any concerns about their child's development while their children received developmental screening. Eighty percent of the children who failed screening had parents with concerns about articulation, language, fine-motor skills, or global development. Ninety-four percent of the children who passed screening had parents with no concerns or concerns in other developmental areas. The types of concerns parents raised did not vary significantly with level of education, experience in child rearing, or other demographic variables. These results suggest that parental concerns may be a helpful adjunct to standardized developmental screening.\r"

There are data that suggest that iron absorption is increased with exocrine pancreatic deficiency and that administration of pancreatic enzymes may impair oral iron absorption. We compared oral iron absorption over a 3-hour period in the presence and absence of exogenous pancreatic enzymes in 13 stable young-adult patients with cystic fibrosis and 9 age-matched control patients. Although none of the patients with cystic fibrosis had a hemoglobin level less than 119 g/L, serum ferritin levels were less than 25 micrograms/L in 5 of the 13 patients, and the mean corpuscular volume was significantly lower in the patient group (86.1 +/- 2.7 vs 90.9 +/- 5 fL). Baseline mean serum iron levels were higher in controls (18.9 +/- 5.9 mumol/L) than in patients (11.9 +/- 6.3 mumol/L). There was no difference in iron absorption in the absence of exogenous pancreatic enzymes. Significant impairment of iron absorption was detected in both patients with cystic fibrosis and controls after administration of a preparation of pancreatic enzymes. There was an inverse relationship between iron stores, as measured by serum ferritin, and iron absorption. These findings suggest that long-term consumption of pancreatic enzymes by patients with cystic fibrosis may contribute to iron deficiency.\r"

The median duration of documented neutropenia was 13 days (range, 1 to 491 days). Infectious complications occurred in 4 of the 36 patients who had neutropenia for more than 30 days (2 with stomatitis, 1 with cellulitis, and 1 with pneumonia) but in none with shorter durations of neutropenia. There were no significant associations between the development of an infectious complication and either the initial absolute neutrophil count or the lowest documented absolute neutrophil count, nor was there a correlation between the initial absolute neutrophil count and the duration of neutropenia. These data indicate that infectious complications occur in otherwise well children with unexplained neutropenia that persists, but these infections are infrequent and usually are superficial.\r"

After long-term treatment with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and oxygen, and coincident with improvement in the airway disease, there was catheterization-proved diminution of pulmonary hypertension. Whether asthma and pulmonary hypertension were causally linked is unknown, but further work seems indicated to elucidate the relationship between bronchoconstriction and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Furthermore, aggressive management of even mild reactive airway disease may be warranted in patients with pulmonary hypertension, regardless of apparent cause.\r"

Increased bilirubin production at 3100 m vs 1600 m was shown by increased levels of corrected carboxyhemoglobin. This finding was supported by increased erythropoietin and bilirubin values in cord blood and increased hematocrit values at day 3 among infants at 3100 m vs 1600 m. The sustained elevation in bilirubin for breast-fed vs formula-fed infants at 1600 m was observed for both feeding types at 3100 m. The findings suggested that there is a hematologic response to decreased oxygen availability at high altitude, resulting in increased bilirubin production accompanied by delayed bilirubin clearance.\r"

Affective and anxiety disorders were determined with a structured interview and standard diagnostic criteria. Symptoms were reported by the subsets of subjects with and without neuropathy, ranging in prevalence from 8% to 35%. Log-linear analysis indicated that each group of symptoms (upper gastrointestinal symptoms, altered bowel habits, and abdominal discomforts) was more significantly associated with psychiatric illness (p less than 0.01 for each) than with peripheral neuropathy (p greater than 0.2 for each). In this study, where anxiety and depression were prevalent, no symptom group was significantly associated with autonomic neuropathy once the effects of psychiatric illness on the analysis were taken into account (p greater than 0.2 for each). These findings suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms occurring in diabetic patients are poorly related to neuropathic complications and may often represent gastrointestinal syndromes commonly associated with psychiatric illness.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary angioedema is a familial disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling and abdominal pain. Whereas most patients are successfully treated with androgenic steroids, some have abdominal pain unresponsive to therapy. To determine whether acid-peptic disease could account for the abdominal pain unresponsive to androgen therapy, we performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and determined basal acid output in 21 consecutive patients with hereditary angioedema and abdominal pain. Mean basal acid output of this group was 6.0 +/- 5.9 mEq/h, with five patients having gastric acid hypersecretion (defined as a basal acid output of greater than 10.0 mEq/h). The abdominal pain in 18 responded to stanozolol, whereas the pain in three patients did not change. Acid-peptic mucosal disease (esophagitis or duodenal ulcer) was present in these three patients with abdominal pain unresponsive to androgen therapy, all of whom had gastric acid hypersecretion (basal acid outputs of 13.7, 19.1, and 21.5 mEq/h, respectively). These three patients were treated with ranitidine but required increased doses to control their gastric acid hypersecretion, and to promote complete relief of abdominal pain and healing of their esophagitis or ulcer disease. These results indicate that there is a subset of patients with hereditary angioedema whose abdominal pain may be secondary to acid-peptic disease and gastric acid hypersecretion. Such individuals may require increased therapeutic doses of antisecretory medication to promote complete healing of esophagitis or ulcer disease. Basal acid output and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are important determinants when evaluating abdominal pain in patients with hereditary angioedema that fails to respond to standard therapy.\r"

In a preliminary investigation, all patients showed a prolonged whole gut (oroanal) transit time as measured with radiopaque markers. Mouth-to-cecum transit time was studied through the serial determination of breath H2 after administration of 12 g lactulose diluted in 120 ml water. Breath H2 was measured with a gas analyzer and was determined in parts per million (ppm). Breath H2 after lactulose was also determined in the group with constipation after a 10-day diet that included either glucomannan (1 g tid orally) or placebo administered in a double-blind manner. The results show a statistically significant increase in mouth-to-cecum transit time in the group with constipation, compared with controls, and a return to within the normal range after the 10-day treatment with glucomannan. With placebo, no difference in transit time was noted. We therefore suggest that chronic idiopathic constipation is a disease that involves the whole gut.\r"

Significantly lower rectal distention volumes were required for rectal sensation, critical volume, and to induce rectal contractility in patients with active disease compared to controls or patients with quiescent disease. Rectal compliance was significantly reduced in patients with active and quiescent disease. The increased rectal sensitivity and contractility in patients with active colitis appear to be related to active mucosal inflammation and ulceration. Episodes of mucosal inflammation may be responsible for chronic changes in the rectal wall resulting in fibrosis and decreased compliance in patients with quiescent disease. The frequency and urgency of defecation and the fecal incontinence may be due to a hypersensitive, hyperactive, and poorly compliant rectum.\r"

Forty-eight polyps greater than or equal to 3.0 cm were identified in 46 patients. Twenty polyps were entirely benign, 20 polyps contained noninvasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma was present in eight polyps. Four of the invasive cancers were associated with residual adenoma; the remaining four were polypoid carcinomas. Among the eight cases of invasive carcinoma, four had tumors that did not extend through the submucosa. Invasive cancer was more prevalent in left-side sessile lesions but was absent in all 10 right-sided polyps. Thirty-two polyps were removed by colonoscopic polypectomy. Four patients required colectomy after polypectomy for the following reasons: incomplete excision (N = 1), presence of invasive carcinoma at the resection margin (N = 1), and inability to define the level of carcinoma on pathologic examination (N = 2). Two polyps with cancer confined to the submucosa were successfully excised colonoscopically. Complications of polypectomy included three cases of minor hemorrhage. Sixteen polyps (the majority located in the right colon) were removed by primary surgical colectomy. We conclude that colonoscopic polypectomy is oncologically and technically successful for most large colorectal polyps. A minority of large polyps require colectomy because of incomplete removal or the presence of invasive cancer that is not curable with colonoscopic excision.\r"

  ".U": "89333648\r", 
  ".W": "Adenomatosis coli (or familial polyposis of the large bowel) and related syndromes are relatively rare diseases characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. In these diseases, the entire colorectal mucosa is covered by hundreds (often innumerable) polyps of various dimensions. In addition, several extracolonic abnormalities have been reported. In the present study, we describe the clinical features of eight families from northern Italy fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of adenomatosis coli. Information was available on 123 unaffected and 30 affected family members. The most relevant findings of the study can be summarized as follows. 1) Gene frequency was calculated to be between 1:7,300 and 1:19,000. Segregation ratio in affected branches was 0.57, with a gene penetrance of nearly 60% and a male:female ratio of 1.73. 2) Extracolonic manifestations were present in all families and in 15 of 30 affected patients, the most frequent being cutaneous cysts and retinal lesions. No case fulfilling the classical criteria of Gardner syndrome was observed. 3) When the diagnosis of adenomatosis followed the appearance of symptoms, colorectal cancer had usually already developed, whereas no malignant changes were observed in individuals diagnosed in the asymptomatic stage. When colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was the treatment of choice, polyps tended to recur in the rectal stump, and long-term endoscopic follow-up was necessary. In conclusion, adenomatosis coli may account for a definite proportion of colorectal neoplasms observed in the general population. Taking into consideration the genetic base of the disease, it follows that individuals at risk should be closely monitored for several years. Moreover, clinical investigations should not be limited to the large bowel, but should be extended to the skin, upper digestive tract, fundus oculi, bones, and probably other organs.\r"

The patients were randomized into a control group (no pyloroplasty) and a study group (pyloroplasty). Gastric emptying was delayed in both groups, postoperatively; however, the delay was greater in the control group than in the study group. Therefore, vagotomy delays the emptying of the thoracic stomach, and this delay is not completely corrected by pyloroplasty.\r"

The 30-mm balloon achieved a 70% satisfactory result, and the 35-mm balloon, 93%, including two patients who did not achieve a good response to the smaller balloon. No complications occurred. Dilation pressure, which averaged only 7 +/- 2 (SD) lb/inch2 (psi), was determined by insufflating 1-2 psi more than needed for complete gastroesophageal waist expansion at fluoroscopy. The mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) of 39 +/- 11 (SD) mm decreased by 68% with the 35-mm balloon and 60% with the 30-mm. Solid food emptying by radionuclide scintiscan, which pretreatment averaged 62 +/- 36% (mean +/- SD) retention at 20 min, was highly variable both before and in response to dilation. A decrease in scintigraphy of less than 25% retention was present in two of three unsatisfactory treatment responses. A decrease of LESP of greater than 50% and scintigraphy greater than 25% corresponded well with a satisfactory response from the dilation. The excellent results obtained with this system, as well as the distinct advantages of durability, presence of three reliable sizes, and ease of use, make this an attractive alternative to other dilating systems in the treatment of achalasia.\r"

  ".W": "Although lower esophageal sphincter (LES) dysfunction has been reported in patients with diffuse esophageal spasm, recent changes in manometric criteria for spasm and for LES relaxation suggested a need for reassessment. Moreover, LES relaxation in reflux-associated spasm has not been reported previously. On clinical criteria and independent of manometric findings, 22 patients with spasm were assigned to either idiopathic (I-DES, N = 9) or reflux-associated spasm (R-DES, N = 13) groups. Patients who underwent manometry for chest pain (C-NL, N = 10) or reflux (R-NL, N = 10) and had normal peristalsis served as control groups. Percent LES relaxation was significantly reduced in both spasm groups, and R-DES had significantly lower percent relaxation than I-DES. Post-deglutitive nadir sphincter pressure was significantly greater in R-DES than in I-DES. Duration of relaxation was normal in I-DES, but was significantly decreased in R-DES. This study indicates that 1) LES relaxation may be impaired in I-DES patients meeting current criteria for spasm, 2) the impairment in I-DES is primarily in \"amplitude\" of relaxation, i.e., percent relaxation and nadir pressure, but not duration, 3) LES relaxation may also be impaired in R-DES, and 4) the impairment in R-DES is to a greater degree than in I-DES patients and may be seen in both \"amplitude\" and duration of relaxation. This study shows that there is a spectrum of sphincter dysfunction in patients with esophageal spasm. It also suggests that there may be separate mechanisms for LES relaxation in R-DES patients, one with impaired relaxation and the other with near complete relaxation, \"transient\" or otherwise, to allow for reflux.\r"

Liver biopsy specimens taken during treatment revealed predominantly decreased hairy cell infiltration in the dilated sinusoids and enlarged or vacuolar nuclei of hepatocytes, compared with those in the liver before treatment. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes in specimens taken during treatment showed cytoplasmic vacuoles, weakly stained glycogen particles, and conspicuously decreased endoplasmic reticulum. Liver tests revealed decreased serum cholinesterase and total cholesterol levels in the early stage of treatment, low levels of total protein and albumin during treatment, and a very low value in the [13C]aminopyrine breath test. No clinical reports have been made on the decreased microsomal function during treatment with interferon. alpha-Interferon damaged the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, although it was effective for the reduction of hairy cells in the liver of hairy cell leukemia.\r"

Immunohistochemistry applied for the tumors clarified the epithelial, hormonal, and metaplastic character. Epithelial tumor markers, i.e., carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), were positive in these tumors. The neuroendocrine nature was demonstrated by positive results of chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Hormonal activities were not confirmed in the tumor cells.

Known toxicities of metronidazole are discussed, as well as potential mechanisms by which metronidazole may have induced pancreatitis in our patient. Since metronidazole is used to treat a host of infectious and inflammatory conditions, its causal relationship with pancreatitis must be carefully considered.

A survey of more than 450 patient-years' experience with CPD revealed 23 episodes of Acinetobacter peritonitis (AP), making this the second most common form of gram-negative peritonitis. Concomitant break in sterile technique and exit-site/tunnel infection were infrequent. AP appeared as the first peritonitis episode in five cases and as the second in six cases, and the duration of CPD at the time of AP ranged from less than 1 to greater than 56 months. However, AP was noted to appear shortly after treatment of another peritonitis episode or shortly after CPD access placement, within 2 months in 11 cases (47%) and within 3 months in 14 cases (61%). Treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics succeeded in 21 cases (91%) without CPD interruption or catheter removal, with tobramycin or gentamicin alone in 16 cases, and with combined aminoglycoside and penicillin or cephalosporin in six cases. In two cases intraperitoneal antibiotics alone were insufficient therapy: one case with concomitant tunnel infection and dialysate leak and one case with bacteremia while receiving corticosteroids. The time-dependent incidence of AP suggests opportunistic infection during a vulnerable period in the first 2 to 3 months following another peritonitis episode, but AP also appears amenable to intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy alone without interruption of the CPD routine in the majority of cases.\r"

However most of these studies have been performed in symptomatic patients with significant AI bone disease. Whether this test may provide similar data at an earlier stage of AI toxicity is not known. The present study evaluates prospectively 28 patients with mild AI load. Patients studied ranged in age from 21 to 65 years; duration of dialysis was 5.6 +/- 3.2 years; deferoxamine, 40 mg/kg body weight, was infused at the end of dialysis. Serum AI was measured before DFO administration and before the next dialysis treatment. Bone biopsies were performed in all patients. Cortical bone AI was determined biochemically; trabecular and cortical bone AI were also determined histochemically. Mean basal serum AI (43.2 +/- 30.8 micrograms/L) and cortical bone AI (25.7 +/- 35.2 micrograms/g) were moderately increased. Basal serum AI correlated (r = 0.77) with the increment in serum AI after DFO infusion. After DFO, stainable trabecular and cortical bone AI correlated in a similar manner with both basal serum AI and increment in serum AI. Only biochemically determined cortical bone AI was not significantly related to basal serum AI. Nineteen of the 28 patients had evidence of osteitis fibrosa on bone biopsy. Stained AI surfaces but not trabecular AI were different in patients with low and patients with high bone formation rates. The bone findings, assessed as bone formation rates and resorption surfaces, did not correlate with biochemically or histochemically determined bone AI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the series, glomerular immune complexes were identified in 6 of 17 patients who initially presented with anti-GBM disease. In four cases, glomerular immune complexes were noted in renal biopsies obtained at clinical presentation; in the other two, they were first demonstrated seven and 28 months after presentation, when circulating anti-GBM antibody levels were undetectable. Circulating immune complexes were detected in only two of six patients, either 28 months before or 17 months after the demonstration of the glomerular membranous lesion. The association of glomerular immune complexes and anti-GBM disease may be coincidental with immunologically-unrelated immune complexes localizing in the GBM for physico-chemical reasons; or the presence of glomerular-bound anti-GBM antibodies may predispose to the deposition of molecules with particular affinity for these antibodies. One patient with glomerular immune complexes used heroin, which may be associated with immune complex formation and the development of glomerulonephritis; and one patient was subsequently thought to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An antecedent infection was found in two of the four patients who had glomerular complexes at presentation, but in only three of 13 with uncomplicated anti-GBM disease. Three of 6 patients with superimposed glomerular complexes had a history of exposure to organic solvents before the onset of disease, while none in the group with anti-GBM disease alone had.\r"

Three cultures yielded gram-positive organisms without clinical peritonitis becoming evident. Fourteen of the 20 episodes of peritonitis had received antibiotics prophylactically. System contaminations were classified into tears or holes of the catheter at the adapter on the Tenckhoff catheter or at the tubing connection to the dialysate bag and breaks of the connecting devices from either dialysis catheter to dialysis tubing or dialysis tubing to dialysate bag. System contaminations accounted for 20 of the 333 episodes of peritonitis that occurred during this time. Identifying system contamination is useful because prophylactic antibiotic therapy may prevent peritonitis.\r"

  ".W": "While examining protein metabolism in hemodialysis patients, we noted that lengthening the interdialytic intervals from two to three days reduced the dialysate nitrogen waste excretion (D-N2; mg/min) and lowered the patient's protein catabolic rate (PCR; g/kg/d). D-N2 was measured in the spent dialysate and PCR derived from urea kinetics while patients maintained a constant dietary intake. In the basal state (B), D-N2 decreased from 5.43 to 4.32 mg/min when the interdialytic interval was increased from two to three days (P less than 0.001). Similarly, PCR was reduced from 0.96 to 0.82 g/kg/d when the interdialytic period was extended. The same phenomenon was observed when subjects were taking either thyroid hormone (T3) or ipodate (lp) to increase or decrease body metabolism. In the T3 period, D-N2 was 6.12 and 5.06 mg/min and PCR was 1.08 and 0.92 g/kg/d, respectively, when the interdialytic intervals were two and three days (P less than 0.001). During the lp period, N-D2 was 4.78 and 4.03 mg/min and PCR was 0.88 and 0.76 g/kg/d, respectively, for the two- and three-day intervals (P less than 0.05). These data are consistent with dialysis-related protein catabolism. It appears that the longer interdialytic interval allowed the body to shift to a more anabolic state.\r"

All patients experienced an increase in hematocrit level. The mean hematocrit level in the study population was 19.8% before therapy and 31.5% after therapy. Eighty-four percent of patients reported an increase in their sense of well-being. Better appetite was subjectively noted by 81% of patients. Improvements in sexual function (62%), socializing (70%), sleep (68%), and skin color (51%) were also noted. An increase in exercise capacity was reported by 78% of patients; objective measurements showed that the mean value of VO2max in a subgroup of 11 patients increased by 50% after treatment. The Karnofsky score calculated in 29 patients showed improvement in all patients except those aged greater than 70 years. The group mean Karnofsky score increased from 76 before to 86.6 after therapy, indicating that with r-HuEPO treatment subjects were able to exert themselves to perform ordinary activities. Before therapy 14 of the patients were unemployed; after therapy only two did not work. Those side effects that occurred, predominantly iron deficiencies, hypertension, and hyperkalemia, were controlled by appropriate clinical management. Treatment with r-HuEPO does improve the quality of life and ability to work of uremic patients and does not adversely affect their transplant potential.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO; EPOGEN [epoetin alfa], AMGEN Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) rapidly corrects the anemia associated with end-stage renal disease during the acute phase of therapy and supports hematocrit levels throughout the maintenance phase. However, during the acute phase of therapy, iron deficiency will develop in most patients; it is therefore initially essential to monitor body iron stores monthly. A plasma ferritin level of less than 30 ng/mL or a transferrin saturation level of less than 20% confirms the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Microcytic, hypochromic red cell morphology appears only after prolonged iron deficiency due to inadequate monitoring and insufficient iron supplementation; alternatively, microcytosis in the presence of adequate iron stores suggests aluminum toxicity. In all patients except those with transfusional iron overload, prophylactic supplementation with ferrous sulfate (325 mg up to three times daily) is recommended. When oral supplements, which are poorly tolerated at high doses, are insufficient to meet the extraordinary needs resulting from r-HuEPO-induced erythropoiesis, intravenous iron dextran (500 to 1,000 mg administered in five to ten doses) may be required. During the maintenance phase of therapy, it may be necessary to continue iron supplementation to counteract ongoing loss of iron associated with blood loss through dialyzers and gastrointestinal bleeding. At the other extreme of iron balance, iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients, recent studies suggest that the ability of r-HuEPO to mobilize iron stores can be harnessed with therapeutic phlebotomy to reverse transfusional iron overload.\r"

Leukocyte and muscle DNA from individuals with optic atrophy, microangiopathy, or normal fundi from maternal lineages were studied by Southern blot analysis, using mouse mtDNA as a hybridization probe. The mtDNA mutation, detected as SfaNI site polymorphism, was seen in 10 of the 19 families. In one family, the mutation was seen only in the two affected individuals, indicating recent origin for the mutation. Nine families and 28 maternally unrelated controls did not show the mutation. The results imply that alternative mtDNA mutations are associated with LHON and that this genetic heterogeneity may be the cause of the interfamilial variation in the clinical expression of LHON. In the families showing the SfaNI site mutation, the mutation was homoplasmic in all individuals irrespective of their disease status, suggesting that the intrafamilial variation in the clinical expression is not due to different ratios of mutant versus normal mtDNA.\r"

Either an increase or a decrease in risk may be observed for a relative of a proband, according to whether there is a causal relationship between liability to disease and age at onset. Likelihood formulas are given for pairs of relatives under a number of different sampling schemes, and it is shown how data collected from relatives enable maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters of a linear model relating disease liability and age at onset. A genotype-environment extension of this model was fitted to data on age at onset for schizophrenia that were obtained from the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Twin Registry. Age at onset is correlated between twins, but this correlation appears to be associated with factors that are separate from those which affect liability to disease. However, even this relatively large sample of twins is too small to draw firm conclusions about any causal relationship between disease liability and onset.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic and environmental influences on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were examined in 371 French-Canadian families by using path analysis. Familial environment was estimated with environmental indices constructed from as many as 14 (of a pool of more than 100) correlates of blood pressure (BP). Approximately 20% of the variance in BP can be accounted for by the composite index, and the types of variables and the direction of their effects vary as a function of age and of the multivariate context. Path analysis of the family data suggests that genetic heritability is relatively high in children (from 0.49 for SBP to 0.56 for MBP) but much smaller in adults (from 0.08 for DBP to 0.18 for SBP). The proportion of variability explained by familial environment is estimated to be the same in children and adults and is much higher than reported to date (from 0.30 for SBP to 0.42 for DBP). In addition, sibships share significant nontransmitted environmental effects, and there is no evidence to suggest specific maternal effects in the aggregation of BP. Two unique findings emerge from this study. First, unlike in most earlier studies, we were able to arrive at the same parsimonious model for each of the BP variables. Second, the familial environment accounts for a substantial proportion of the variability in BP, which has been considerably underestimated in earlier studies.\r"

  ".W": "Nonpenetrance of the inherited mutation responsible for retinoblastoma has been reported. By DNA analysis in families with hereditary retinoblastoma, it is possible to identify healthy individuals in whom the mutation is nonpenetrant. This requires the use of DNA markers both within and flanking the retinoblastoma gene. We have analyzed the segregation of several markers in 19 families (69 meioses) with hereditary retinoblastoma. In two families a carrier was identified who showed nonpenetrance of the mutation predisposing to retinoblastoma. The intragenic markers were informative in 15 pedigrees. The use of flanking markers from the same chromosomal region caused an increase of the number of informative families to 18. No crossing-over within the gene was observed. In one family an inherited deletion involving one of the RB1 alleles was detected. Our findings emphasize the use of a combination of both intragenic and flanking markers to obtain both the highest reliability of carrier detection in families with hereditary retinoblastoma and an accurate estimate of the frequency of nonpenetrance.\r"

As part of genetic-epidemiologic studies of the impact of HLA on fertility, HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ typing was performed on a total of 650 Schmiedenleut Hutterities in South Dakota. An extraordinary degree of homogeneity was found. HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A24, and -A26 accounted for 83%, HLA-B8, -B27, -B35, -B51, -Bw60, and -Bw62 for 75%, and HLA-DR1, -DR2, -DR3, and -DR4 for 66% of the antigens at the respective HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci. All Hutterites characterized for HLA were descendants of no more than 78 ancestors. However, family analysis identified only 45 unique HLA haplotypes thought to reflect the original gene pool. Eight haplotypes were particularly frequent, accounting for nearly 50% of all observed haplotypes; four of these were consistent with a European ancestry. Coefficients measuring linkage disequilibrium were computed from haplotypes identified by family analysis. Overall, HLA analysis portrayed the Schmiedenleut Hutterities as a homogeneous and unique population, with disequilibrium among particular alleles and a spectrum of common and uncommon European haplotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorylase kinase (PHK), the enzyme that activates glycogen phosphorylases in muscle, liver, and other tissues, is composed of four different subunits. Recently isolated rabbit muscle cDNAs for the larger two subunits, alpha and beta, have been used to map the location of their cognate sequences on human chromosomes. Southern blot analysis of rodent x human somatic cell hybrid panels, as well as in situ chromosomal hybridization, have provided evidence of single sites for both genes. The alpha subunit gene (PHKA) is located on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome in region Xq12-q13 near the locus for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1). X-linked mutations leading to PHK deficiency, known to exist in humans and mice, are likely to involve this locus. This hypothesis is consistent with the proximity of the Phk and Pgk-1 loci on the mouse X chromosome. In contrast, the beta subunit gene (PHKB) was found to be autosomal and was mapped to chromosome 16, region q12-q13 on the proximal long arm. Several different autosomally inherited forms of PHK deficiency for which the PHKB could be a candidate gene have been described in humans and rats.\r"

One clone also contained a gene for U1 RNA, and so the organization of the two multigene families could be directly compared. The majority, and perhaps all, of the human tRNAAsn genes map to the same chromosome bands as do the U1 RNA true genes and class I pseudogenes located on the short and long arms, respectively, of chromosome 1. These two gene clusters were independently isolated using a somatic-cell hybrid minipanel, and use of repeat-unit DNA polymorphisms showed that one tRNA gene clone maps to the short-arm gene cluster and the other to the long-arm gene cluster. Electron microscopy of heteroduplexes between these two clones showed duplex formation along the proposed region of overlap between them, indicating that the short- and long-arm gene clusters are structurally related. I suggest that the split into two distinct loci was facilitated by a pericentric chromosome inversion. This would have had the effect of positioning the genes currently on the long arm adjacent to the centromeric heterochromatin, perhaps resulting in a \"position effect\" on transcription of these genes. Restriction fragments of different sizes were found that were common to a majority of repeat units, depending on the restriction enzyme being used. Pulsed-field electrophoresis revealed that fragments of molecular weight of 180 kb were common to each unit (or multiples of units). These fragments also contained U1 RNA gene sequences. I therefore propose that these two gene families are closely linked on repeat units (or multiples of units) of 180 kb in size, which are probably organized in tandem arrays.\r"

One recombination event was observed between DXS304 and the fragile-X locus in 36 informative meioses. Combined with information from other reports, our results suggest the following order of the examined loci on Xq: cen-F9-DXS105-DXS98-FRAXA-DXS304-(DXS52-F8 -DXS15). The locus DXS304 is closely linked to FRAXA, giving a peak lod score of 5.86 at a corresponding recombination fraction of .00. On the basis of the present results, it is apparent that U6.2 is a useful probe for carrier and prenatal diagnosis in fragile-X families.\r"

We have analyzed data from Hungary and Czechoslovakia together with published data from five additional countries--Denmark, Switzerland, Scotland, Germany, and France--representing a broad geographic and ethnographic range. The data include 686 complete chromosomal haplotypes for eight RFLP sites assayed in 202 unrelated Caucasian families with PKU. Forty-six distinct RFLP haplotypes have been observed to date, 10 unique to PKU-bearing chromosomes, 12 unique to non-PKU chromosomes, and the remainder found in association with both types. Despite the large number of haplotypes observed (still much less than the theoretical maximum of 384), five haplotypes alone account for more than 76% of normal European chromosomes and four haplotypes alone account for more than 80% of PKU-bearing chromosomes. We evaluated the distribution of haplotypes and alleles within these populations and calculated pairwise disequilibrium values between RFLP sites and between these sites and a hypothetical PKU \"locus.\" These are statistically significant differences between European populations in the frequencies of non-PKU chromosomal haplotypes (P = .025) and PKU chromosomal haplotypes (P much less than .001). Haplotype frequencies of the PKU and non-PKU chromosomes also differ significantly (P much less than .001. Disequilibrium values are consistent with the PAH physical map and support the molecular evidence for multiple, independent PKU mutations in Caucasians. However, the data do not support a single geographic origin for these mutations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

More than 10 RFLP sites have been reported within the PAH structural locus in Caucasians. With information from affected and unaffected offspring in PKU families it is often possible to reconstruct complete RFLP haplotypes in parents and to use these haplotypes to follow the segregation of PKU within families and to determine the distribution of PKU chromosomes within populations. To establish the utility of these RFLPs in characterizing Asian families with PKU, we typed eight DNA sites in 21 Chinese families and 12 Japanese families with classical PKU. The eight RFLPs were chosen for their informativeness in Caucasians. From these families we reconstructed a total of 91 complete PAH haplotypes, 44 from non-PKU chromosomes and 47 from PKU-bearing chromosomes. Although all eight marker sites are polymorphic in both Chinese and Japanese, there is much less haplotypic variation in Asians than in Caucasians. In particular, one haplotype alone, haplotype 4, accounts for more than 77% of non-PKU chromosomes and for more than 80% of PKU-bearing chromosomes. Haplotype 4 is also relatively common in Caucasians. The next most common Asian haplotype is 10 times less frequent than haplotype 4. By contrast, in many Caucasian populations the sum of the frequencies of the five most common haplotypes is still less than 80%, and several of the most common haplotypes are equally frequent. Even though the extent of haplotypic variation in Asians is severely limited, the few haplotypes that are found often differ at a number of RFLP sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a project sponsored by a local community hospital, we conducted a telephone survey to determine unmet health-care needs of low-income families living in Orange County, California, and made recommendations to address those needs. METHODS: The survey assessed demographic characteristics and access to medical care of 652 adults and their families. RESULTS: In general, we found that the poor (incomes below 125% of the poverty level), the uninsured, and the Latino respondents had lower access measures than the nearly poor (incomes between 125% and 200% of the poverty level), insured, and Anglo subjects. However, insurance status was the strongest predictor of access in this low-income population. Important unmet health-care needs included prenatal care and preventive care. In response to our findings, the sponsoring hospital has instituted new health-care programs to help meet these needs. CONCLUSION: This community-oriented approach for improving problems of access to medical care for the poor may be appropriate for other localities.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We compared the long-term outcome of patients with lupus nephritis in whom normalization of complement levels (CH50) was sustained by adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy to those patients with persistently low complement levels despite similar immunosuppression in whom therapy was adjusted solely on the basis of clinical disease activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine female patients with lupus nephritis recruited from 1972 to 1979 were prospectively studied (mean follow-up, 116.7 +/- 11 months). Entry criteria included initial renal biopsy, low CH50, and elevated anti-DNA antibody levels. A second biopsy was performed in 24 patients after an interval of 40.6 +/- 5 months. Treatment was started with prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg/day was added if complement was not normalized by prednisone alone. Twenty-five of 39 patients had normal complement levels within six months (Group 1), and immunosuppressive therapy was tapered but continuously readjusted to the lowest dosage that preserved normal CH50 and maintained clinical remission. Eight of these 25 patients subsequently became persistently hypocomplementemic due to inadequate drug intake (Group 1B), whereas the complement levels continued to be controlled in the other 17 patients (Group 1A). Despite similar therapy, the remaining 14 patients did not achieve normalization of complement within the initial six months of therapy, and therefore future treatment decisions were based solely on clinical symptoms (Group 2). Renal pathologic lesions were classified according to World Health Organization criteria and a semi-quantitative chronicity index. RESULTS: During the first six months, there were no significant differences in clinical or histologic features between patients in whom complement levels were controlled and patients in whom complement levels were not controlled. After a mean observation period of 10 years, however, patients with consistent normalization of complement (Group 1A) did much better than patients with only short-term complement control (Group 1B) or persistent hypocomplementemia (Group 2). Both groups with low complement levels had a similar outcome with significantly worse kidney and patient survival. Life-table analysis demonstrated that the differences in outcome between complement-controlled and complement-uncontrolled groups became apparent only after five or more years of follow-up. Patients with a low chronicity score on initial biopsy whose complement level was controlled did uniformly well with no renal failure or death. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the relation of bleeding to prothrombin times and important remediable lesions in outpatients treated with warfarin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An inception cohort of 565 patients starting outpatient therapy with warfarin on discharge from a university hospital was assembled. Detailed records of outpatient prothrombin times were obtained for 103 of 130 case subjects with major or minor bleeding and for 117 control patients without bleeding. A nested case-control design was used to evaluate the association of bleeding with temporally related prothrombin times; odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression analysis to control for known predictors of major bleeding. The relation of bleeding to important remediable lesions was determined in all 130 cases of bleeding. RESULTS: For each 1.0 increase in the prothrombin time-to-control ratio, the odds ratio for major bleeding during the week after a prothrombin time measurement increased 80%; the odds ratio for minor bleeding increased 50%. These odds ratios were lower during the first month of therapy and higher thereafter. Bleeding was related to important remediable lesions in 49 of 130 cases (38%), but these lesions were unknown before bleeding in only 22 cases (17%). The mean prothrombin time rose sharply at the time of bleeding in patients without important remediable lesions, but not in patients with lesions. New, previously unknown lesions (including nine malignancies) were discovered in 20 of 59 case subjects (34%) with gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria, but in only two of 71 case subjects (3%) with other bleeding (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results provide a valid quantitative basis for estimating the odds of bleeding in relation to the prothrombin time and the yield of diagnostic evaluation in patients with bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To further the understanding of diabetic heart disease, we tested the hypothesis that an asymptomatic group of normotensive diabetic patients between 20 and 50 years old had a restrictive cardiomyopathy independent of clinically significant coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography and stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy were performed to detect and characterize the cardiac abnormalities in this study group comprising 88 patients with rigorously classified diabetes and 65 volunteer control subjects. RESULTS: Diabetic patients were shown to have a mildly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume index: 50.1 +/- 8.2 and 52.1 +/- 14.7 mL/m2 for patients with type I and type II diabetes, respectively, versus 58.9 +/- 11.7 mL/m2 for control subjects. The left ventricular diastolic filling was also impaired in diabetic patients as reflected by a lower atrial emptying index: 0.73 +/- 0.24 and 0.76 +/- 0.3 for type I and type II diabetics, respectively, compared with 1.14 +/- 0.24 for control subjects. Exercise tolerance was normal in subjects with type I diabetes and slightly reduced in subjects with type II diabetes. Only one patient developed regional ischemia on thallium exercise testing. CONCLUSION: Using a comprehensive, noninvasive approach, we have shown that asymptomatic normotensive patients with type I or type II diabetes who were between 20 and 50 years old had a restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by mildly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume and altered left ventricular compliance independent of critical coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Lymphoma cells usually show cytogenetic abnormalities, but their relationship to prognosis has not been as extensively studied as in leukemia. A group of previously untreated cases of lymphoma with evaluable metaphases was examined for the association between cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 104 patients, from whom fresh tumor samples were obtained for cytogenetic tests. Because of the complexity of lymphoma karyotypes, the cases were divided into four patterns according to the type of abnormality of chromosome 17 or 7 present. Treatment of patients was given based on histologic grade and stage of disease. Response to treatment was evaluated according to previously described methods. RESULTS: Patients with true abnormalities of chromosome 17 or 7 (defined as those with either structural abnormalities of the short arm of these chromosomes or monosomy of these chromosomes with no associated unidentified markers) were observed to have an adverse prognosis. The overall response rate and tumor-related mortality were less favorable for patients with these cytogenetic abnormalities. By applying multivariate analysis, we found that this observation was independent of the effect of serum lactic dehydrogenase level, histologic grade, or tumor burden. CONCLUSION: True abnormalities of chromosome 17 or 7 in patients with lymphoma are associated with a poor response to chemotherapy, short time to treatment failure, and high tumor-related mortality rate. These findings raise the question of the potential involvement of some gene or oncogene, perhaps the p53 oncogene, which might impart a survival advantage to the malignant cells.\r"

In addition, we review the seizure type, neurologic examination, and other clinical features to better address diagnostic and management issues in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 100 cases of new-onset seizures in HIV-infected patients who underwent complete evaluations at the University of California, San Francisco, hospitals. RESULTS: Seizures were the presenting symptom of HIV-related illness in 18 patients, six of whom developed no other HIV-related illness until at least four months after the first seizure. Common causes in the 100 patients included mass lesions, HIV encephalopathy, and meningitis. No cause for the seizures was found in 23 patients despite a complete evaluation. An underlying cause was found in all patients with focal neurologic deficits but in only two of 24 who had normal results on an interictal neurologic examination. Focal ictal features were not predictive of cause. A cause was found in all 12 patients with status epilepticus or medically refractory seizures. A total of 12 of the 87 (14%) patients who received phenytoin developed a hypersensitivity reaction. Despite the brevity of follow-up in some patients, many patients, including those with no definable cause, had multiple seizures prior to the administration of anticonvulsants. CONCLUSION: The direct effects of HIV on the brain may be the single most common cause of seizures in this population. We favor treatment of a single seizure in patients with HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Secondary failure to treatment with oral antidiabetic agents frequently occurs in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the search for causes of such failures, we examined patient- and disease-related factors in nonresponders and in responders to treatment with oral antidiabetic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of three groups: (1) 34 nonresponders to treatment with sulfonylureas; (2) 25 patients who still responded to treatment with sulfonylureas; and (3) 10 age-matched healthy control subjects. In addition to patient-related factors such as adherence to diet and knowledge of diabetes, we examined insulin response to a test meal and hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity during a euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3H-3-]glucose. RESULTS: Patient-related factors such as daily nutrient intake, activity score, knowledge of diabetes, and \"stress level\" were similar in both groups. However, nonresponders had a higher rate of basal hepatic glucose production (4.60 +/- 0.14 versus 3.63 +/- 0.26 mg/minute/kg of lean body weight; p less than 0.001), which was less suppressed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (about 100 microU/mL) than was that of the responders (p less than 0.001). In addition, total insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism was reduced (5.07 +/- 0.22 versus 7.09 +/- 0.56 mg/kg.LBM.minute; p less than 0.001), and this was mainly accounted for by a reduction in non-oxidative glucose metabolism (glycogen synthesis and anaerobic glycolysis) (1.78 +/- 0.22 versus 3.54 +/- 0.49 mg/kg.LBM.minute; p less than 0.001). The severity of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance correlated with the plasma glucose concentration but was unrelated to insulin secretion. In a multiple linear regression analysis, glucose overproduction in the liver (26.1%), impaired peripheral glucose metabolism (17.3%), and insulin deficiency (12.6%) could explain only 56% of the causes of secondary drug failure. CONCLUSION: Secondary failure to treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents is determined by the disease itself rather than by patient-related factors. Treatment of secondary drug failure should therefore aim at ameliorating both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance.\r"

In seven of nine eyes a cone was identified. Large amounts of corneal distortion were seen in selected patients even though they had excellent spectacle-corrected visual acuity and little or no distortion of the keratometer mires. These findings suggest that corneal topography analysis systems are useful in the detection and description of corneal irregularity in the early stages of keratoconus. The radial keratotomy surgeon should be aware that normal results on slit-lamp examination and normal keratometry and refractive data do not rule out the presence of early keratoconus.\r"

We also compared the results before and after inversion within each group. Intraocular pressure increased to approximately two times normal in each group. Significant improvement in visual acuity and reduction in central keratometry were noted only in Group 1. By multiple regression analysis, visual improvement correlated with the number of incisions but not the time since surgery. Our study provides evidence that increased intraocular pressure may account for transient changes in vision and corneal curvature after radial keratotomy.\r"

Fifty-one patients were tested four times within a four-week period; the severity of disease varied from incipient to advanced. We determined the dependence of threshold variability on defect depth and test point location. In areas of the visual field initially found to have moderate loss of sensitivity, variation in follow-up measurements ranged from normal sensitivity to absolute defect, with little dependence on distance from fixation. Conversely, large changes were considerably more unusual in locations initially showing normal or near-normal sensitivities, and variability was lowest in the most central portion of the field. Our findings suggest that differentiation between true progression and random variation will be facilitated if these factors are taken into account, as well as if comparisons are based on more than two tests. The complex nature of interest variation in glaucoma makes it natural to approach this problem with the help of computer-assisted analyses.\r"

Two patients had optic neuropathy, one had intermittent subluxation of the globe, and five had symptoms of exposure or increased pressure in the orbital area. In our eight patients, the two with optic neuropathy improved, the patient with subluxation of the globe became asymptomatic, and the other five had less exposure and were more comfortable. The amount of decompression ranged between 4 and 7 mm. The lacrimal sac was injured in one patient; temporary silicone intubation avoided any permanent sequela.\r"

One week after injection, endothelial cells and pericytes of the capillaries near the inner surface of the optic disk and rays were labeled; fibroblast-like cells, which were also labeled, migrated and formed vitreous strands. By the second week after injection, the fibrovascular tissue proliferated most actively, and traction medullary ray detachment and peripapillary retinal fold formation were observed. The cellular proliferation was accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration. Glial cells within the optic disk, as well as retinal pigment epithelial cells beneath the detached retina, were labeled by 3H-thymidine. These results demonstrate that the fibrovascular proliferation originates from the vessel complex of the optic disk and medullary rays in this experimental model of retinal detachment.\r"

Earlier diagnosis of retinoblastoma and refinements in conservative methods of management are believed to be the main reasons for this trend away from enucleation.\r"

In normal liver laminin transcripts were detected in vascular endothelial, in bile duct epithelial, and in portal tract mesenchymal cells as well as in perisinusoidal cells of the lobule. In fibrotic liver, expression of laminin RNA was increased in proliferating bile duct epithelial cells, stromal cells of fibrotic septa, and in perisinusoidal cells of the regenerating nodules. Although recently suggested as a major source of laminin, hepatocytes in none of our samples showed evidence for significant laminin B1 gene transcription. Thus laminin synthesis does not appear to be a function of hepatocytes, but rather of mesenchymal, endothelial, and bile duct epithelial cells in the liver. This pattern of laminin expression underlines the importance of the mesenchyme in conditioning the function and differentiation of the hepatic parenchymal compartment.\r"

In serial sections analyzed with the two probes, hybridization signals were obtained from both, and in similar proportion, irrespective of CIN grade. The distribution and character of hybridization signals suggests that the morphologic progression of precancers is not associated with either cessation of HPV 16 early transcription or a change in the general character of the transcripts produced.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that endothelial cell-derived oxidants could contribute to neutrophil-mediated endothelial cell injury and cytotoxicity has been a subject of speculation. Rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs) were examined for the presence of xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, a well-known source of O2-. Using a sensitive assay based on measurements of radioactive xanthine conversion to uric acid by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), RPAEC extracts were found to contain both XO and xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) activities. Extracts from early passage cells have 55.3 +/- 11.7 (mean +/- SE) units/10(6) cells of total (XO + XD) activity, one unit of activity being defined as the conversion of 1% of substrate to product in 30 minutes of incubation. XO comprised 31.6 +/- 3.1% of this total activity. Addition of human neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in RPAEC XO activity from 31.6 +/- 3.1% to 71.7 +/- 4.8% of total without altering total (XO + XD) activity. The neutrophil dose-response curve for increase in XO paralleled closely the curve for neutrophil-mediated RPAEC cytotoxicity. The basal XO and XD activities and the neutrophil-induced increase in XO activity were inhibited by treating RPAECs with allopurinol, oxypurinol, and lodoxamide, which also inhibited cytotoxicity, but not by catalase, superoxide dismutase, or deferoxamine. Addition of H2O2 failed to cause an increase in RPAEC XO activity or XD to XO conversion. The results suggest that during neutrophil-mediated injury, rapid conversion of RPAEC XD to XO occurs, resulting in increased XO, catalyzed endogenous oxidant production, which may contribute to the oxidant burden in the killing mechanism initiated by activated neutrophils. Although the mechanism for conversion of XD to XO is uncertain, it appears that neutrophil-derived H2O2 is not sufficient to cause this phenomenon. Furthermore, neither O2- nor chelatable iron is required for neutrophil-induced XD to XO conversion. Supernatant fluids from activated neutrophils failed to induce XD to XO conversion in RPAECs. This in vitro system provides an opportunity to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo phenomenon of XD to XO conversion associated with ischemic/reperfusion or inflammatory tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "Complement-activating bovine serum albumin (BSA)-anti-BSA immune complexes (ICs) were injected into rabbit knee joint cavities; the contralateral control joint was injected with BSA together with normal rabbit serum. The migration of leukocytes from the synovial venules into the joint cavity was analyzed with light microscopy (LM), scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. EM autoradiography was used to study the endocytosis of ICs by leukocytes. The shape, orientation, and distribution of migrating polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNGs) were analyzed by LM morphometry. PMNGs accumulated in the joints injected with ICs. The peak of the number of PMNGs in the synovial tissue was reached after 4 hours, in the joint cavity after 6 hours. PMNGs in the synovial tissue were concentrated in the intimal layer. Migrating PMNGs were polarized, as judged by the ratio between the long (D max) and short (D min) axes of the cells. There was a close association between the migrating PMNGs and the collagen fibers. The morphometric data showed that the nonflattened, cylindrically-shaped PMNGs were oriented along the collagen bundles, running parallel to the synovial surface, and did not migrate in the straight direction of a theoretic leukotactic gradient originating in the joint cavity after IC deposition. SEM and TEM showed that the PMNGs were aligned along the collagen fibers and interacted activity with the collagen by pseudopods and cytoplasmic projections. EM autoradiography showed that the PMNGs in the joint cavity had ingested 125I-labeled ICs and were degranulated. In contrast, the PMNGs within the synovial membrane did not show any signs of IC endocytosis or any apparent degranulation. Synovial type A cells were found to contain ICs. This study indicates that the response of PMNGs in IC-induced synovitis consists of two distinct phases: an initial, mainly migratory phase in the synovial membrane where the PMNGs appear to use the collagen fibres as a climbing framework, and a second phase, in the joint cavity, characterized by PMNG metabolic activation, endocytosis of ICs, and degranulation. The apparent inability of PMNGs in the synovial membrane to ingest ICs and become degranulated might be due to not only concentration differences of ICs and leukotactic factors between the joint cavity and the synovial tissue but also might be related to the apparently active interaction with collagen.\r"

In this study GSA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (GSA-FITC) was used to purify cultures of murine cerebral microvascular endothelium. Cultures were stained with GSA-FITC, then sorted using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). GSA-positive endothelial cells were collected, re-cultured, and subsequently re-analyzed by FACS using GSA-FITC. Cultures that initially contained 80 +/- 3 to 89 +/- 3% (X +/- SE) GSA-positive cells were purified to 98 +/- 1% positivity. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-muscle-action antibody confirmed that FACS sorting of GSA-FITC-stained cells effectively removed contaminating smooth muscle cells from endothelial cell cultures. Viability, proliferation, and prostaglandin production of the cells was unaltered by lectin staining and FACS sorting. Thus, GSA-FITC can be used in conjunction with flow cytometry to enhance the purity of murine endothelial cell cultures without adversely affecting cell viability, growth, or metabolism.\r"

Exposure of rats to aerosols of respirable cristobalite for 8 days led to a rapid influx of neutrophils and macrophages into alveolar and tissue compartments of the lung followed by a more gradual accumulation of T lymphocytes. This inflammatory response persisted throughout 52 weeks after the end of the exposure. For some variables studied there appeared to be a cyclical nature to the response. Statistical analysis of alveolar cell populations and lung tissue weight, protein, and hydroxyproline showed significant time-dependent fluctuations. Histologic analysis revealed a progressive deposition of collagen and type II cell hyperplasia centered on airways, however, there appeared to be some correlation between fluctuations in alveolar cell populations and overall tissue pathology. The observed cellular and biochemical fluctuations and the persistence of the inflammatory response may be due to the presence of silica in the lung, which serves as a source of repetitive stimulation of lung cells.\r"

All rats that survived over 8 weeks exhibited liver fibrosis with portal-portal, portal-central, and central-central bridging. In all rats that survived over 16 weeks, micronodular cirrhosis of the liver or extensive liver fibrosis was observed. The copper content of the cirrhotic/fibrotic liver was above 250 micrograms/g dry weight. Electron-microscopic x-ray analysis at day 93 revealed that copper stored in secondary lysosomes was always accompanied by a proportional amount of sulfur (correlation coefficient, 0.98; P less than 0.005). An experimental model of copper toxicosis in terms of copper-induced cirrhosis of the liver was established with exogenous copper chelated by nitrilotriacetate.\r"

  ".W": "Newborn respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) results from a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant has three ultrastructural forms: lamellar bodies, which, when secreted from Type II pneumocytes, transform into tubular myelin; tubular myelin in turn gives rise to the phospholipid monolayer at the air-fluid interface in the alveolus that constitutes functional surfactant. It has been shown previously that the lungs of infants dying from RDS lacked tubular myelin despite the presence of abundant lamellar bodies, whereas the lungs of control infants dying from other causes had both tubular myelin and lamellar bodies. An abnormality in the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin in RDS was proposed as a possible explanation for this finding. To evaluate the role of surfactant proteins (SPs) in this conversion, the authors re-examined the lungs of 11 RDS infants and 10 control infants for reactivity with antisera to high and low molecular weight SPs. In control infants, abundant intense staining with antisera to both types of SPs was found, but in the RDS lungs, staining was weaker than that in controls and less intense for high molecular weight compared to low molecular weight SPs. In lungs from patients with RDS, although staining increased with increasing gestational and post-natal ages, the intensity was less than control levels at all ages. The correlation of deficiency of SPs in RDS with lack of tubular myelin suggests that SPs may be involved in the conversion of normal lamellar bodies to tubular myelin and that the deficiency of SPs could explain the persistent respiratory distress in the presence of surfactant phospholipid synthesis.\r"

A casual observation that bone marrow biopsies of HIV-infected individuals seem to exhibit an unusually large number of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei (DN-MK) prompted a study comparing MK of 20 HIV-seropositive individuals with those of 10 patients with HIV-negative idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and 10 hematologically normal subjects. In normal marrows the number of DN-MK average 2.1 +/- 0.5 SE per 10 low power field. In patients with ITP the average number was 6.5 +/- 1.4 SEM, whereas HIV-ITP marrows had an average of 42.5 +/- 3.7 SEM. Electron microscopy of AIDS megakaryocytes exhibited ballooning of the peripheral zone to an extent not seen by us in any other myelodysplastic syndromes. These observations support the concept that the pathophysiology affecting MK/platelets in HIV-infection should not be equated with the destructive process underlying other immune thrombocytopenias.\r"

By indirect immunofluorescence using anti-SAA/AA antibodies the initial deposition of SAA/AA was recognized in the marginal zone of spleen at 20 days after azocasein injection. Indirect immunofluorescence using anti-fibronectin antibodies also showed meshwork positivity in the corresponding area more intensely than that in controls. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-SAA/AA revealed the presence of positively stained flocculent materials on cell surfaces of macrophages in the marginal area in addition to amyloid fibril. The tissue fibronectin rapidly increased in the spleen and maintained 10 times more than that of controls until the 20th day. Binding assay of SAA on frozen sections revealed the presence of SAA-binding substances in the perifollicular area. Affinity chromatographic assay showed fibronectin have a binding capacity to SAA1 and SAA2. By binding assay on the microtiter plate, SAA had more affinity to fibronectin than those of heparan sulfate, collagen type I, or serum amyloid P component. These results indicate that fibronectin plays an important role in the development of amyloidosis by working as a linking protein between SAA and the cell surface of macrophages.\r"

The present study used immunohistochemical methods to examine LNT and NeuAc2----3LNT expression in normal human tissues, 29 germ cell tumors, and over 200 tumors of other histologic types. In addition, their distribution was compared with that of Lex, a previously characterized cell surface carbohydrate antigen. Our results show that LNT and NeuAc2----3LNT are consistently expressed in germ cell tumors and that each has a distinct, highly restricted distribution in normal tissues. LNT and NeuAc2----3LNT expression in germ cell tumors is predominantly localized to embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac components, whereas Lex is found primarily in teratoma components with intestinal and bronchial differentiation. Areas of seminoma variably express NeuAc2----3LNT and LNT but are Lex-negative. Immunohistochemical results obtained with different fixation procedures suggest that some cell types in vivo express NeuAc2----3LNT, LNT, and Lex determinants only on glycolipids, whereas other express them on both glycolipids and glycoproteins or only on glycoproteins. Thus, the tissue distribution of these antigens may be controlled by differential expression of the requisite glycosyltransferases as well as the availability of different classes of carrier molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied thymus specimens taken at autopsy from eight acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and compared these with those taken from four patients with congenital immunodeficiency (unrelated to an intrinsic thymus defect) and seven patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. In all cases, histology showed a severely involuted architecture, compatible with a debilitating disease before death. There were no major differences between thymus tissue in AIDS patients and in the other patients studied. This argues against the claim expressed in the literature that the epithelial microenvironment incurs particular HIV-1-induced injury in AIDS. This conclusion is substantiated by immunohistochemistry for HIV-1 gag and env proteins, and by hybridohistochemistry for gag/pol and env mRNA of HIV-1. Positive cells were observed only in low numbers, both inside the epithelial parenchyma and in the (expanded) perivascular areas. An interesting finding was the labeling of subcapsular/medullary epithelium in normal uninvoluted thymus by a number of antibodies to HIV-1 gag p17 and p24 proteins. Compatible with this labeling was the staining of epithelial stalks in hyperinvoluted thymuses irrespective of disease category. The previously reported cross-reactivity between HIV-1 core protein and thymosin alpha 1 cannot fully explain this observation, because the epithelium in the hyperinvoluted state is negative for thymosin alpha 1. This study confirms and extends previous reports on the endogenous presence of epitopes of retroviral antigens in thymic epithelium.\r"

The antibody is an IgG1 antibody and it recognizes an antigen with a molecular weight of 200 kd, corresponding to that of leukocyte common antigen. OPD4+/CD4+ T cells provided better help for pokeweed mitogen-stimulated polyclonal IgG production than OPD4-/CD4+ T cells. OPD4 recognized the H/I T cell subset even in paraffin-embedded tissue sections, but did not recognize nonhematopoietic cells, suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, B cells, monocytes in the peripheral blood, or other normal hematopoietic cells as examined by the flow cytometric and immunoperoxidase methods. Besides the lymphoid cells, OPD4 reacted with a number of histiocytes (epithelioid cells) in tissues from sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. For the neoplastic lesions, OPD4 reacted with approximately half of the cases of T cell lymphomas.

Arthroscopy was done on eight knees at the time of screw removal, eight for knee pain, two for giving way, and three for recurrent effusions. The degree of synovial joint reaction, graft synovial ingrowth, and graft rupture was graded. Microscopic examination was carried out on all biopsies of the GORE-TEX ligament. The average patient age was 30 years and the average time interval from original implantation to second look was 11 months. The GORE-TEX was intact in 11 knees, 10% ruptured in 6, and completely ruptured in 4. There was no correlation between number of GORE-TEX strands ruptured and synovial reaction. No particles of the graft were noted in the synovium if the implant was intact, but particles were noted with graft rupture. We conclude that the intact GORE-TEX ligament is an inert substance and does not cause significant joint reaction. Impingement in the intercondylar notch appeared to be the most common cause of graft failure. Further study is critical to determine the natural history of the GORE-TEX ligament and the knees' response to this prosthetic device.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral vertical ruptures of the medial (N = 24) and the lateral (N = 4) meniscus were repaired in 28 patients (mean age, 27 years). They all had an ACL lesion, combined in 26 cases with a MCL tear. These injuries were reconstructed or sutured during the same session as the meniscus repairs. Approximately 1 year later, meniscal healing was proven arthroscopically in 20 and the other 8 had no clinical signs of meniscal rerupture. All patients were reexamined between 6 to 8 years after the initial repair. Instrumented stability testing, the Lysholm knee function score and an activity score (Tegner) were used. The patients' subjective evaluations were also recorded. In spite of the previous reconstruction, all knees were quite unstable (mean +5 mm increased laxity compared with the uninjured side). At followup, 3 of the 28 repaired menisci (11%) had reruptured in connection with a minor trauma during sports or daily activity. The knee function score averaged 88 points, the activity level dropped 2 steps compared with activities before injury (from 7 to 5). Twenty patients were satisfied with the results, 5 partly satisfied, and 3 not satisfied. A healed meniscal tear has a good chance of survival in an unstable knee. The most critical period of meniscal repair probably lies in the healing period just after surgery.\r"

Repair methods included standard suture (control), reinforced suture [expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch and polydioxanone (PDS) tape augmentation] and stapling (nonarthroscopic and arthroscopic soft-tissue staples). The average strength of intact rotator cuff tissue (supraspinatus tendon) was also determined. The different rotator cuff repairs, including at least one control, were performed on fresh-frozen human cadaver shoulder pairs. Repairs were tested to failure in pure tension with the shoulder fixed in 60 degrees of abduction. Load and displacement data were normalized to controls, grouped according to failure modes, and statistically analyzed. The two basic failure modes observed were 1) bone failure, or suture tearing through the bone (indicating weak bone stock) and 2) tendon failure, or suture tearing of the rotator cuff. Gross comparisons between intact and repaired tendons indicated that the intact tendon was two to three times stronger than the repaired tendon. Based on the mode of failure and lack of increased strength after repair, the use of staples for cuff attachment is discouraged. PDS tape suture reinforcement did not increase fixation strength. In contrast, PTFE patch suture augmentation demonstrated statistically higher initial failure loads than did the control and was of specific benefit for shoulders with weak bone stock.\r"

A limited number of clinical and laboratory studies currently document the effectiveness of bracing. The purpose of this project was to determine if commercially available bracing could be shown to produce objective evidence of medial stabilization of the knee. Our model involves the use of a cadaver lower extremity with a fixed foot and suspended femur with a free knee and a lateral impact load applied simulating a clipping injury. Force transducers were placed on the ACL and medial collateral ligament (MCL) and an electrogoniometer was attached to the extremity. The prophylactic braces studied had a limited capacity to protect the MCL from direct lateral stress with the knee in full extension. In flexion or with a change in direction of the load, the protective effect is greatly reduced. The functional braces had a capacity to limit abduction and rotational stresses on the MCL in flexion and extension.\r"

Eight muscles were evaluated for the serve, forehand, and backhand strokes. The serve was divided into six stages and the ground strokes into four stages. EMG tracings were subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and a relative measure of quantity was obtained. Analysis of variance and Turkey tests were then done to assess statistical significance (P less than 0.05). The ground strokes showed low activity in all muscles tested during the preparation phase. During the acceleration phase, both the backhand and forehand showed a generalized increase in all muscle activity. Both strokes showed marked activity of the wrist extensors and, in addition, the forehand showed high activity in the brachialis and biceps. In the follow-through phase, there was a generalized decrease in muscle activity. The serve showed low activity in all muscles tested during the wind-up phase. The wrist extensors increased their activity in the cooking phase, with marked activity in late cooking. The pronator teres and the triceps showed increased activity in the acceleration phase. Follow-through phase showed low muscle activity except for the biceps, which increased in late follow-through. In conclusion, the muscles of the elbow help stabilize the elbow as a unit during the ground strokes in these high level players. Power in the serve comes from increased activity in the triceps and pronator teres. The predominant activity of the wrist extensors in all strokes may be one explanation for predisposition to injury.\r"

  ".W": "Treadmill walking/jogging in water is a potentially useful therapeutic modality. Since energy costs of this activity are unknown, we compared oxygen consumption (VO2) of treadmill walking/jogging in water to a dry treadmill at speeds of 40.23 to 160.9 meters/min (m/m) in 13.4 m/m increments in 11 subjects. At speeds greater than or equal to 53.6 m/m, ankle depth, below knee, midthigh, and waist depth walking/jogging in water significantly elevated VO2 and heart rate (HR) above dry treadmill walking (P less than 0.05). At speeds greater than or equal to 134.1 m/m, VO2 of waist depth jogging was not significantly greater than dry jogging. These findings showed no gender specificity. Treadmill walking/jogging in waist depth water at temperatures of 30.5 degrees C and 36.1 degrees C was compared to dry treadmill walking in five subjects. The rate of increase of HR compared to VO2 was significantly greater at 30.5 degrees C than dry walking, and greater at 36.1 degrees C than 30.5 degrees C (P less than 0.05). Treadmill walking in water can double the oxygen cost of movement depending on the depth and speed, and the response to increasing speed is nonlinear. Water temperature affects the relationship of HR to VO2 at waist depth, suggesting that water temperature can add a significant thermal load to the cardiovascular system. Metabolic and cardiovascular demands of treadmill walking/jogging in water must be considered when using this modality since greater external work results at much lower speeds than on land.\r"

Medical coverage for the 1985 Junior Olympic Games was provided by certified athletic trainers (ATC), physicians, and other health care personnel. This study assessed the services of the 30 attending ATCs who managed 121 significant injuries. Standard injury information was collected by the ATCs and separately collected by their physicians. Nine months after the Games, phone interviews were conducted with the injured participants and assessment questionnaires were given to the attending physicians. Results revealed that young, injured, Junior Olympic participants generally did not inform their parents about their injuries or medical contact while at the Games. Athletes and physicians overwhelmingly agreed that they were positively impressed with the capabilities of the ATCs with whom they had contact. About 70% recovered from the symptoms and limitations of injury, as determined by the athlete, within the month following the Games. About 17% sustained some type of injury recurrence to the same body part, and at 9 months about 97% of the athletes had fully recovered from their injuries. These data not only indicate that athletic trainers can accurately identify minor athletic injury but signify the importance of long-term followup in our athletic populations. Multisport events, such as the Junior Olympic Games, impose considerable problems to a communication effort. The athletic trainer, as an ever-present figure in collegiate and professional circles, can be the central focus of an adequate communication effort regarding the patient care of other athletic populations.\r"

The results revealed that male dancers demonstrated significantly more negative personality traits and psychological distress than female dancers or men in the general population. In addition, physical stress and personality traits, characteristic of the \"overachiever,\" distinguished injured dancers. It is suggested that classical ballet's emphasis on the ballerina may be at odds with a masculine identity in male dancers. Furthermore, the qualities that lead to success in this profession may contribute to injuries if carried to an extreme.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic posterior shift test, a clinical method for evaluating both straight posterior instability and posterolateral rotatory instability, (PLRI), is a simple, dynamic, and reliable (reproducible) test that serves as an adjuvant to other clinical tests designed to evaluate an injury or insufficiency of posterior structures in the knee. The examiner maintains the hip at near 90 degrees of flexion to control rotation of the femur while slowly extending the knee passively. The hamstrings should be stretched to maintain their tightness. The tightened hamstrings assist gravity in subluxating the tibia posteriorly; they also provide dynamic axial loading to the joint as the knee is extended. In knees with posterior instability, the posteriorly subluxated tibia suddenly reduces as the knee joint nears full extension, and a jerk or \"clunk\" is felt by both the patient and the examiner. Thus, the patient's feeling of instability is reproduced by the test. We have used the dynamic posterior shift test for 5 years (as an adjuvant in our physical examination) to evaluate signs of posterior instability of the knee. Not only is the test reliable, but it is more definitive than other tests in evaluating straight posterior instability and PLRI. It is easy to perform and the results are reproducible. Because this test is dynamic rather than passive, it enhances the accuracy of evaluating posterior instability of the knee.\r"

The extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) have been implicated as primary culprits in this pathology. Tennis elbow has been treated using a constrictive band placed several centimeters distal to the origin of these two muscles. Aircast (Aircast Inc., Summit, NJ) has developed a new style of band that employs an air-filled bladder as the counterpressure element. This study tested the effect of both standard and Aircast bands on EMG activity of the EDC and ECRB proximal to the band compared to control values. Ten normal subjects, ranging in age from 20 to 43 years, were tested. Right upper extremities were tested in all cases. The subjects' forearms were stabilized in the CYBEX II forearm stabilization V-pad. The ECRB and EDC were then impaled with monopolar EMG needle electrodes. The CYBEX data were recorded using the HUMAC system and the EMG data were recorded and analyzed using the Cadwell 7400. EMG data were recorded at 80% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) with no band, the standard band, and the Aircast band. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures of integrated EMG (IEMG) and Duncan's multiple comparison tests revealed that the Aircast caused a significant reduction in IEMG of the ECRB and EDC when compared with control values and the standard band. The decrease in IEMG with the standard band was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nerve conduction velocity studies confirmed the diagnosis in the five patients on whom the test was performed; other studies served primarily to exclude other causes of pain. All patients were treated surgically by neurolysis of the peroneal nerve as it travels under the sharp fibrous edge of the peroneus longus origin. Seven of eight had excellent results and returned to their previous level of physical exertion without further symptoms. We think entrapment of the peroneal nerve at the fibular neck is a more common entity than previously recognized, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of exertional lateral leg pain.\r"

Twenty-two of 25 patients (88 percent) underwent diagnostic arteriography. Twelve patients (48 percent) with 9 occlusive and 3 minimal injuries were observed. Seven patients (28 percent), three with exsanguinating hemorrhage, were treated by operative exploration and VA ligation. Six patients (24 percent), two with a VA pseudoaneurysm and four with an arteriovenous fistula, were managed by percutaneous transcatheter embolization. The neurologic status was unchanged or improved in 22 patients (88 percent) at discharge. Two patients developed Horner's syndrome after VA ligation. Transient posterior circulation ischemia occurred in a single patient after percutaneous transcatheter embolization. There was no mortality. The majority of VA injuries are best managed by nonoperative methods. Untoward neurologic sequelae are rare. Operative intervention and VA ligation should be reserved for patients with active hemorrhage or large pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas which cannot be embolized.\r"

The total duration of intraoperative silent myocardial ischemia, the percentage of intraoperative time silent myocardial ischemia was present, the number of intraoperative episodes of silent myocardial ischemia, and the intraoperative heart rate in the treated patients were compared with those in 152 similar but untreated peripheral vascular surgery patients. The patients treated with oral metoprolol had significantly less intraoperative silent ischemia with respect to relative duration and frequency of episodes, a significantly lower intraoperative heart rate, and less intraoperative silent myocardial ischemia in terms of total absolute duration. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic activation may play a major role in the pathogenesis of silent myocardial ischemia during peripheral vascular surgery.\r"

Average tube graft insertion time was 17 minutes and required 0.9 units of transfused blood. There were two postoperative deaths (6 percent), both secondary to myocardial infarction. None of the patients with ruptured or suprarenal aneurysms died. No patients had permanent renal or neurologic deficits, and no instances of postoperative bleeding, wound infection, pseudoaneurysm formation, or graft migration were encountered. The sutureless intraluminal graft can be implanted easily and quickly and is safe for use in the abdominal aorta. It is particularly helpful in the management of suprarenal or ruptured abdominal aneurysms, in which speed is important, and in effecting technically difficult anastomoses to friable aortic tissue.\r"

Infection or gangrene that compromises the plantar skin flap may preclude a standard transmetatarsal or midfoot amputation, thereby culminating in a below-knee amputation. We report a series of forefoot infections with loss of the distal plantar skin. Open or guillotine amputation at the mid-metatarsal level led to a high rate of healing and a durable stump, provided that the level of infection did not extend beyond the metatarsal heads. Wound closure was obtained by wound contracture alone or by use of partial-thickness skin grafting. Rehabilitation was dependable. The association of diabetes mellitus or gangrene did not adversely affect outcome. Open transmetatarsal amputation is a safe surgical option preferable to midfoot or below-knee amputation for the treatment of severe forefoot infection that does not extend proximally beyond the metatarsal heads.\r"

Subclavian vein thromboses showed no side or sex predilection and were due to anatomic abnormalities, intravenous lines, or radiation. Iliofemoral venous thrombosis showed poor response to lytic therapy, whereas subclavian vein thromboses were effectively lysed in those patients in whom it could be used. Massive venous thromboses of the extremities, although similar in presentation, have different characteristics depending upon the extremity affected.

Eight other patients developed compartment syndrome requiring delayed fasciotomy. In seven of them, vein was either ligated or the repaired vein became occluded. In the eighth patient, peripheral venous hypertension was caused by massive swelling of the thigh. In the laboratory, compartment pressure was monitored by wick catheter in 24 hind limbs of 12 dogs subjected to experimental conditions simulating vascular injuries and their management. There was a significant increase in compartment pressure in a group that simulated arterial and venous injuries managed by arterial repair and venous outflow obstruction. Based on our study, we suggest that obstruction to venous drainage and venous hypertension are major factors in the development of compartment syndrome in dual vascular injuries of the lower extremity.\r"

In order to determine the short- and long-term limb salvage and graft patency rates achieved in these patients, the records of 35 patients undergoing 38 attempted femoral-tibial bypasses to a calcified recipient artery were reviewed. Two patients were unreconstructable at the time of surgery. Thirty-one of the 36 operations (86 percent) were performed using in situ saphenous vein bypass techniques, 3 were performed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 1 with a composite sequential, and 1 with a composite vein graft. Immediate limb salvage was achieved in 31 of 36 limbs (86 percent). Five early below-knee amputations (14 percent) were required, two due to graft thromboses and three due to progressive foot necrosis despite patent grafts. One patient (3 percent) died secondary to sepsis. Three-year primary graft patency and limb salvage rates did not differ significantly from bypasses to noncalcified vessels. Femoral-distal bypass in the presence of overt calcific arterial disease may be successfully accomplished and offers an excellent prognosis for long-term graft patency and limb salvage.\r"

Twenty-two patients had lower-extremity and 15 had upper-extremity injuries. No deaths occurred. Five delayed amputations were performed for limbs left denervated by associated soft tissue or neural injuries. No late vascular insufficiency was recorded in patients who underwent reconstruction with autogenous tissue. Whenever possible, the precise site of vascular injury was identified angiographically to help plan an approach that would provide adequate exposure for vessel repair as well as orthopedic stabilization. Vascular reconstruction typically preceded osseous stabilization. We conclude that improved outcome requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, expeditious limb revascularization, fasciotomy as indicated, rapid fixation of osseous injuries, and adequate soft tissue coverage of the underlying repair.\r"

A series of 17 patients is presented to illustrate the utility of this approach. There was one operative death in an emergent patient; the cause of death was not related to the method of aortic exposure. The remaining patients recovered quickly. The anatomic advantages and limitations of this exposure are discussed. We believe that retroperitoneal aortic exposure is superior to midline transperitoneal exposure. Aortic exposure utilizing a right retroperitoneal approach is a useful option in the surgical armamentarium.\r"

The cause of ascites was hepatic in 29 patients (Group 1, 54 percent), malignant in 13 (Group 2, 24 percent), and nephrogenic in 12 (Group 3, 22 percent). The peritoneovenous shunt failed in 11 patients (20 percent): 6 in Group 1, 3 in Group 2, and 2 in Group 3. Shunt outflow obstruction (thrombosis) was the principal cause. Systemic sepsis in five patients and variceal hemorrhage in three were the factors responsible for most of the deaths (22 percent). Of the 42 patients who survived operation, the peritoneovenous shunt was effective in controlling the massive ascites in 37 (86 percent). Eight patients (15 percent), four with hepatic and four with nephrogenic ascites, survived 3 years or more without ascites. Removal of at least 50 to 70 percent of ascitic fluid at the time of shunt insertion was considered an important factor in decreasing morbidity and mortality. A peritoneovenous shunt can be effective for a long-term period in controlling massive ascites with an hepatic or nephrogenic cause in a selected group of patients; however, in patients with malignant ascites, although the benefit was substantial in half, the survival period did not exceed 6 months.\r"

Banded and unbanded grafts were implanted in a paired fashion. Hemodynamic studies included Reynolds number and phonoangiography as measures of turbulence. Intimal-medial thickness was measured 8 weeks after implantation. Reduction of the volumetric flow rate by 50 percent resulted in significant changes in flow velocity, flow pulsatility, pressure, and turbulence at the venous anastomosis. Hyperplastic lesions developed in a reproducible manner at the venous anastomosis of the unbanded but not the banded grafts, as evidenced by combined intimal-medial thickness measurements: unbanded grafts 0.68 +/- 0.13 mm (p less than 0.01 versus control), banded grafts 0.25 +/- 0.03 mm (p greater than 0.05 versus control). Stepwise regression analysis indicated Reynolds number had the best correlation with the development of hyperplasia (r = 0.915, p less than 0.005), this being the first time this correlation has been quantitatively determined. We conclude that flow disturbance or turbulence is a major factor in the development of venous intimal-medial hyperplasia in arteriovenous loop grafts.\r"

We developed an animal model using contralateral carotid artery ligation, which produced ipsilateral carotid blood flows (640 +/- 44 ml/min) and internal carotid stump pressures (52 +/- 4 mm Hg) over a range commonly seen in carotid artery surgery. Seven shunts were tested and included Javid; 10F and 8F Brener; and 14F, 12F, 10F, and 8F Argyle shunts. The hemodynamic features evaluated for each shunt included maximum shunt flow, the pressure gradients occurring across each shunt, the increase in cerebral perfusion pressure over occlusion pressure associated with shunt placement, and the distal pressure pulse waveform. The larger diameter shunts were consistently better than the smaller diameter shunts. The correlation between shunt flow and the increase in distal pressure produced by shunt placement was high (r = 0.98, p less than 0.05), confirming that high flow rates maintained high perfusion pressure. By relating maximum shunt flow and the pressure gradient to the change in the pressure pulse contour for each shunt, it could be demonstrated that at the larger diameters, straight shunts displayed superior hemodynamic characteristics compared with tapered shunts, whereas at smaller diameters, tapered shunts were superior.\r"

Twenty-four adult patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: Group A (n = 12) received bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 (pH 3.9) 2 mg/kg, while Group B (n = 12) received alkalinised bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 (pH 6.4) 2 mg/kg. Increasing the pH of the local anaesthetic solution significantly reduced block latency from 25 minutes in Group A to 12.5 minutes in Group B (p less than 0.001) and prolonged the duration of useful analgesia from 14.1 hours to 18.3 hours (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in plasma bupivacaine levels between the two groups. The results indicate that alkalinisation of bupivacaine reduces time to onset and prolongs the duration of useful analgesia when used for sciatic nerve blockade, without significantly increasing systemic absorption.\r"

We judged one-third of the anaesthesia-related morbidity to be preventable. Anaesthetists are faced with an increasing number of patients who are at high risk, and who undergo increasingly extensive surgical interventions. Concomitant with the increasing complexity of care and increasing demands on the anaesthetists may be an expected increase in the incidence of errors.
