  ".W": "1. We studied, in a random sample of 385 nonsmoking men born in 1968-1969 and 31 men born in 1913 or 1923, whether inheritance and environmental factors influenced platelet activity and vessel wall prostacyclin formation, as reflected non-invasively by the urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor-metabolites of thromboxane A2 (2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, Tx-M) and prostacyclin (2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, PGI-M), respectively. 2. Fathers of young men with high platelet activity did not excrete more Tx-M than fathers of young men with low platelet activity. Men born in 1913 or 1923 displayed higher Tx-M (563 versus 128 pg/mg of creatinine, P less than 0.001) and PGI-M (163 versus 130 pg/mg of creatinine, P less than 0.01) excretion than those born in 1968-1969. Excretion of both Tx-M and PGI-M was correlated to the urinary output of noradrenaline and adrenaline. 3. Well-trained subjects did not differ in their excretion of Tx-M or PGI-M from those who did not exercise regularly. A recent acute infection was also unrelated to the excretion of Tx-M or PGI-M. PGI-M excretion was, however, significantly correlated to Tx-M excretion (r = 0.51, P less than 0.001). 4. This study provides the first non-invasive evidence that advancing age and sympathoadrenal tone are positively correlated to platelet activity in randomly sampled men, and that paternal inheritance, physical fitness and recent infection lack correlation to platelet activity.\r"

The primary aim of the study was to determine whether the stimulatory effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and endotoxin on hypothalamic prostaglandin E2 production was influenced by dietary fats containing different amounts of linoleic acid.

A subsidiary part of the study examined the effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha on the ability of the calcium ionophore A23187 to stimulate prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 production by hypothalami from chow-fed rats. 3. While tumour necrosis factor-alpha enhanced prostaglandin E2 production in response to A23187, neither agent had an effect on leukotriene C4 production. 4. Hypothalami from rats fed maize oil exhibited increased prostaglandin E2 production in response to both pyrogens. This did not occur with hypothalami from rats fed coconut oil. 5. Coconut oil might exert its modulatory effect by bringing about a reduction in membrane phospholipid arachidonic acid content.\r"

The activities of nine peptide hydrolases and three non-peptidase brush-border marker enzymes have been quantified in crude homogenates prepared from the proximal, mild and distal regions of small-intestinal mucosa for sham-operated (n = 9) and uraemic (n = 14) rats. Abnormalities in enzyme activities were observed in all regions studied in the uraemic group, although no reduction in food intake occurred. 2. The proximal region of the small intestine from uraemic rats showed a general fall in enzyme activities associated with the brush-border. This fall was combined with a decline in mucosal protein content. In contrast, the mid and distal regions showed increased activity against the dipeptide tyrosyl-glycine. 3. It is proposed that the fall in brush-border enzyme activities in the proximal small intestine of uraemic rats is a response to the increased water intake associated with this, and presumably other, rat models of uraemia. The increased enzyme activity against tyrosyl-glycine found in the mid and distal regions of the small intestine of uraemic rats may be caused by an increased small-intestinal transit rate, but could be an attempt to maximize tyrosine absorption in response to decreased plasma tyrosine levels. 4. This study casts doubt on specific activities being the most useful units of enzyme activity, when measured in crude homogenates prepared from the proximal small intestine of uraemic rats. It also demonstrates that enzyme activities measured at a single site in the small intestine of uraemic rats may not be representative of the enzymatic changes occurring in the small-intestinal mucosa as a whole.\r"

In such cases, cytochemical stains can provide an inexpensive and available diagnostic tool. M1 is positive for SBB and MPO. M5a is usually NSE positive, whereas SBB and MPO are negative. M7 usually is ANA esterase, PAS, and AP reactive, and do not stain with SBB, MPO, and ANB esterases. The megakaryocytic lineage usually is confirmed by ultrastructural cytochemistry for PPO or immunocytochemistry for platelet glycoproteins and von Willebrand factor. PAS block positivity and AP dotlike reactivity are suggestive of lymphoid lineage. NSE stains are useful in differentiating M2 from M4. Morphologic and cytochemical techniques also can suggest the presence of certain chromosomal abnormalities such as t(8;21) and inv(16), which may have an influence on prognosis. Because not all cases of acute leukemia are easily subtyped by morphology and cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, karyotyping, and molecular analysis of DNA and RNA of leukemia cells also may be required to define cell lineage.\r"

Cytogenetic findings correlate significantly with morphologic, immunologic, and clinical features as well as response to treatment, remission duration, and survival. The number of different cytogenetic abnormalities is enormous; however, many cytogenetic findings frequently occur in a given disease (e.g., abnormalities of 5 or 7 in 75% to 90% of patients with therapy-related AML). Some abnormalities are found only in myeloid malignancies, for example, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) and rearrangements of chromosome 16q22, both of which have a good prognosis. Other abnormalities usually are found in both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, for example, the t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(9;22)(q34;q11), both of which have a poor prognosis. The Human Gene Mapping Conferences have compiled much cytogenetic data and produced several interesting correlations in myeloid malignancies: rearrangements of 3q21-26 with myeloid proliferations associated with environmental exposure (similar to abnormalities of 5q, 7q, 12p, and 17q), aberrations of 12p, 11q13 and 11q23 with both myeloid and lymphoid disorders, and the lack of myeloid involvement and abnormalities of chromosomes 14 and 18. In conclusion, cytogenetic analysis of neoplastic cells at diagnosis for patients with MDS, AML, and SAML is required for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The use of chromosome abnormalities to separate patients into high- and low-risk groups eventually may allow us to be more effective in selecting curative therapy.\r"

In CML, because of the restriction of chromosome 22 breakpoints to the bcr, Southern analysis to detect bcr rearrangements also can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In contrast, the translocation breakpoints on the Ph1 chromosome are scattered in ALL, so that other methods such as PFGE and PCR are necessary to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In both CML and ALL, use of these methods to detect molecular abnormalities may be superior to cytogenetics in detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Southern analysis also can be used in CML to map breakpoint locations within the bcr. This may offer prognostic information as to the length of chronic phase, but there is conflicting information as to the validity of this approach. The modified PCR (using cDNA from mRNA) can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome and to define which of the molecular subtypes are present. The exquisite sensitivity of this method, which is capable of detecting as little as a single abnormal molecule of RNA or DNA, makes it suited for the detection of minimal residual disease in both CML and ALL. This is particularly useful after intensive therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation. Whether these low levels of fusion gene expression are of prognostic significance is still unclear.\r"

These abnormalities may originate at the megakaryocyte level. Furthermore, the released abnormal platelets may undergo modification of their functional and biochemical characteristics as a result of episodes of intravascular thrombosis or aging in circulation or as a result of the progression and treatment of the disease, thus creating the paradoxic and often conflicting relationship between the thrombotic and hemorrhagic events and the results of platelet functional tests as observed in this disorder.\r"

We used this technology to study the effect of position (upright vs. supine) on resting UES pressures and the pressure dynamics of the UES/P complex during both wet and dry swallows in 11 normal volunteers and the effects of foods of different consistencies on the UES/P swallow dynamics in 10 normal volunteers. The UES/P coordination parameters were defined as the 15 time intervals that can be measured between any 2 of 6 pertinent points: the beginning, peak, and end of the pharyngeal contraction and the beginning, nadir, and end of the UES relaxation. Data from both the circumferential transducer used to measure sphincter pressures and a standard microtransducer used to measure pharyngeal pressures were collected on-line by an Apple IIe microcomputer and analyzed by programs written in our laboratory. Significant changes in swallow coordination were measured between upright and supine swallows of the same bolus size, between wet and dry swallows in the same position, and among foods of varying consistencies. Resting UES pressure was unchanged by position and pharyngeal contraction pressure was unchanged by bolus size or consistency.\r"

  ".W": "Two methods are used to assess esophageal motility. The mapping technique uses catheter withdrawal at 1 cm steps until the entire esophagus is evaluated. A simpler method is commonly used that involves keeping the catheter stationary for the entire evaluation. We compared these 2 techniques in 30 patients referred for the evaluation of dysphagia. Emphasis was placed on the distal 10 cm of the esophagus because this is the primary location of esophageal motility disorders. There was excellent correlation between techniques for mean distal amplitude (r = 0.945), mean distal duration (r = 0.942), and percentage of non-peristaltic contractions (r = 0.967). The overall manometry diagnosis was similar by both methods in 27 (90%) patients. Three patients had different manometry diagnoses resulting from use of the two techniques. However, the change in diagnosis was only clinically important in one patient in whom the mapping technique identified a segmental motility disorder that had been missed by the stationary technique. Stationary manometry had a 94% sensitivity and 93% specificity rate for identifying motility disorders compared to mapping manometry. We conclude that stationary manometry is a simple and accurate method for evaluating esophageal pressures and distal disorders. Only those patients with normal results of stationary studies may benefit by further mapping to identify rare segmental motility disorders.\r"

These include full-column studies to produce distended films with or without the use of a solid bolus, mucosal relief films to identify mucosal defects such as esophagitis or the presence of varices, double-contrast films, and motion recording (fluoroscopy). The efficacy of each technique depends on the quality of the study and the specific disorder to be detected. Esophageal lesions producing dysphagia are classified into extrinsic structural lesions, intrinsic structural lesions, and esophageal motility disorders. Radiographic studies are the preferred screening techniques for patients with dysphagia. Although not as sensitive for the evaluation of mucosal lesions, radiographic studies are superior to endoscopy for the detection of abnormal motility, esophageal rings, and strictures.\r"

The disease results in smooth muscle dysfunction that causes esophageal aperistalsis and reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressures. Gastroesophageal reflux with poor acid clearance results with an increased incidence of complications such as peptic stricture and Barrett's esophagus. Aggressive medical therapy is necessary to prevent these and other complications of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients.\r"

Misinterpretation of esophageal symptoms may occur not only as a consequence of inadequate history taking and of being biased by a patient's emaciation, age, and gender, which leads to view certain aspects of the patient's history and behavior as suggesting a pathologic attitude towards eating and body weight, but also as a consequence of a misinterpretation of the symptoms as indicative of an eating disorder by the patients themselves. In some cases a disordered attitude toward eating and body weight may develop together or coexist with achalasia. The clinical evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of anorexia nervosa but also of bulimia nervosa should include the taking of a thorough history regarding swallowing and vomiting in order to recognize a possible esophageal motor disorder.\r"

By inhibiting acid secretion, omeprazole causes hypergastrinemia which, with prolonged exposure, exerts a trophic effect on enterochromaffin-like cells with eventual enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoid formation in some animals. This mechanism seems to explain the appearance of enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoids in human hypergastrinemic states, whether associated with hyperchlorhydria, eg, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or with hypochlorhydria, eg, pernicious anemia (nonantral atrophic gastritis). Omeprazole produces modest serum gastrin elevations in humans when monitored over a 24-hr period. Gastrin levels are markedly lower and less sustained than in the above hypergastrinemic states. Extensive gastric biopsy data from patients enrolled in long-term studies indicate that omeprazole administration is not associated with clinically significant changes in the human oxyntic endocrine cell population. Man and rat differ markedly both in their gastrin response to a given level of acid inhibition and in their response to the trophic influence of gastrin on enterochromaffin-like cells. The rat model is a false indicator of risk in man.\r"

Gastric Osmolyte increased fasting pH from a mean of 1.32 to 2.78 (P less than 0.01), while jejunal Osmolyte did not (pH 1.02). Continuous gastric infusion of cimetidine maintained a high gastric pH (5.06) in 17 of 19 patients. Jejunal cimetidine also achieved therapeutic serum levels and raised gastric pH to 4.81 in nine of 13 patients. We conclude that the persistently low gastric pH during jejunostomy tube feeding may play a major role in the upper gastrointestinal bleeding previously observed in such patients and that continuous gastric and jejunal cimetidine infusions effectively raise and sustain a high gastric pH.\r"

Our hypothesis was that if H. pylori was pathogenic in chronic nonspecific gastritis, organisms would be found frequently in this type of gastritis but infrequently in specific forms of gastritis. Prevalence rates of H. pylori were determined independently in patients with eosinophilic and Crohn's gastritis, Menetrier's disease, and chronic nonspecific gastritis. The prevalence of H. pylori in patients with chronic nonspecific gastritis was 71%, whereas the organism was not identified in patients with any form of specific gastritis. This finding further supports the accumulating evidence that H. pylori is a primary pathogenic factor in chronic nonspecific gastritis.\r"

In 12 normal volunteers gastric emptying of a plastic tablet with a metal core was followed by a metal detector in relation to different compositions and various times of ingestion of meals. With an empty stomach and after ingestion of 250 ml water, the mean time for gastric emptying of the tablet was 38 +/- 11 min (mean +/- SEM) and 38 +/- 8 min. Two hundred fifty milliliters of milk (652 kJ) and a formula diet (1000 kJ) delayed gastric emptying time to 128 +/- 14 and 152 +/- 6 min, respectively (P less than 0.05). Breakfast (2200 kJ) further retarded gastric emptying compared with both liquids to 249 +/- 24 min (P less than 0.05). There was a close correlation between nutritive density and gastric emptying of the tablet (r = 0.92; P less than 0.001). Main meals also delayed gastric emptying of tablets when compared to empty stomach (P less than 0.05). A snack after breakfast further delayed gastric emptying from 201 +/- 10 to 278 +/- 19 min (P less than 0.05). The largest delay was observed following ingestion of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and additional snacks (509 +/- 220 min). We conclude that the delay of gastric emptying of enteric-coated tablets by food is related to its nutritive density and eating habits. The gastric emptying of an enteric coated tablet that is ingested early in the morning may be delayed until late at night when several meals and snacks are ingested during the day, leading to unwanted alterations in bioavailability and to possible adverse effects.\r"

All the patients were studied before preileostomy closure and six and 12 months after the closure of the protection loop ileostomy. Stool frequency was identical at six and 12 months (mean +/- SEM: 5.0 +/- 0.4 and 5.3 +/- 0.5/day, respectively). Sixty-six percent of patients at six months and 40% of patients at 12 months need to defecate at least one time during night. Stool weight as well as steatorrhea decreased significantly six months after the closure of loop ileostomy (P less than 0.05). Mean resting anal pressure remained unchanged six and 12 months after closure of the loop ileostomy (41 +/- 6 and 45 +/- 5 cm H2O, respectively). Maximum squeeze anal pressures increased significantly at six (P less than 0.05) and 12 months (P less than 0.05). The rectoanal inhibitory reflex was always absent at the same period. The maximum pouch capacity increased significantly during the first six months (P less than 0.01) from 142 +/- 17 to 279 +/- 27 ml. The maximum infused volume during a saline continence test was not significantly different at six and 12 months; the percentage of evacuation of the reservoir and the volume at which the first ileal contraction appeared in the reservoir increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at six and 12 months. In conclusion, in patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouch reservoir, the closure of the loop ileostomy is associated with spontaneous modifications of the anal and pouch parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The EC50 for 5HT stimulation of distal circular muscle (-7.0 +/- 0.1), distal longitudinal muscle, and proximal circular muscle was similar. Methysergide dose-dependently inhibited the 5HT stimulation of both proximal and distal circular muscle. The IC50 for methysergide inhibition of 5HT (5 x 10(-7) M) stimulation was -5.5 +/- 0.2. Ketanserine and ICS 205-930 did not inhibit 5HT stimulation of colonic muscle. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) decreased the potency, but not the efficacy of 5HT stimulation of proximal and distal circular muscle. Atropine decreased the potency (EC50 = -6.6 +/- 0.1) (P less than 0.05) and the efficacy by 40%. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) caused an on-contraction and off-contraction of distal circular muscle and an on-contraction of proximal circular muscle. 5HT decreased the off-contraction of the distal circular muscle but did not affect the on-contraction of the other muscle strips. 5HT receptor antagonists did not affect EFS of the tissue. The studies suggest: (1) 5HT stimulates circular colonic muscle with greater efficacy than longitudinal muscle, (2) 5HT stimulates circular muscle through a 5HT1 receptor, (3) there is atropine-sensitive and atropine-insensitive 5HT stimulation of circular colonic muscle, (4) 5HT inhibits neurons responsible for the off-contraction in distal circular muscle without affecting the on-contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SP had an inhibitory effect only in the PMNs system but did not modify the activity of xanthine oxidase, thus excluding a scavenger action.

Since sulfasalazine and its metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid are effective therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease and have been shown to inhibit generation of inflammatory products in other cells, we examined the effect of these agents in vitro on human intestinal mast cell mediator release. Sulfasalazine (5 x 10(-4)-10(-3) M) was found to significantly enhance goat anti-human IgE-induced histamine release from intestinal mast cells, which is the same response as seen in human blood basophils, whereas its metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid was an effective inhibitor of stimulated histamine release in both mast cells and basophils. 5-Aminosalicylic acid also inhibited production of prostaglandin D2 by the stimulated intestinal mast cells. Sulfasalazine alone, without immunologic stimulation, did not induce histamine release from mast cells or basophils, but the enhancement of ongoing mast cell activation by sulfasalazine may explain some cases of adverse reactions to the drug. The inhibition of mast cell histamine release and prostaglandin generation by 5-aminosalicylic acid demonstrates a potential therapeutic modality of this agent.\r"

To test whether irrigation of the inflamed mucosa with short-chain fatty acids is useful, we conducted a six-week preliminary trial in 12 patients with distal colitis. Each patient used twice daily rectal irrigations with 100 ml of a solution containing acetate (80 mM), propionate (30 mM), and butyrate (40 mM). Two patients stopped at three weeks, one because of no improvement and the other because of complete resolution of symptoms. Of the 10 who completed the trial, nine were judged to be at least much improved and showed a change in a mean disease activity index score from 7.9 +/- 0.3 (SE) to 1.8 +/- 0.6 (SE) (P less than or equal to 0.002) and in a mucosal histology score from 7.7 +/- 0.7 (SE) to 2.6 +/- 0.7 (SE) (P less than or equal to 0.002). Thus, ulcerative colitis patients appear to benefit from increased contact with or higher than usual levels of these critical energy substrates.\r"

However, some disagreement still exists about the recommended method of performing this test: the 1-hr blood test, the 5-hr urine test, or both. We evaluated the test by performing 125 combined blood and urine tests in 111 patients. Normal xylose absorption was recorded in both blood and urine in 71 tests (group A, 56.8%). Abnormal test results in both blood and urine were recorded in 29 patients (group B, 23.2%). Only one patient had a pathological blood value and normal xylose excretion in the urine. Twenty-four patients (group D, 19.2%) had normal 1-hr blood xylose (greater than 25 mg/100 ml) with abnormal 5-hr urine xylose (less than 4.5 g/5 hr). Fat and/or bile salt malabsorption were documented in 21 patients (87.5%) of this group using stool fat analysis and the [14C]cholylglycine breath test. These data suggest that in adults the 5-hr urine collection more accurately reflects intestinal absorption in comparison with the 1-hr blood value.\r"

After the end of treatment 34% had some residue in the gallbladder; two of these patients developed recurrent stones. MTBE is exhaled, is distributed in fatty tissue, and is excreted renally together with its metabolite tert-butanol. Methanol was found only in traces. Gallbladder histology of six patients showed chronic cholecystitis. Since these findings were independent of treatment time and the interval between treatment end and operation, they are most consistent with stone-related changes rather than caused by MTBE.\r"

  ".W": "In rats with partial portal vein ligation, 95 +/- 0.9% of the splenic blood flow is shunted from the portal to the systemic circulation when an intrasplenic injection of microspheres is used to determine the degree of shunting. Despite this magnitude of portal-systemic shunting, several biochemical and endocrine consequences of portal-systemic shunting occur at levels below what is expected for the degree of shunting found. In an effort to resolve these discordant findings, shunting from both the splenic and the mesenteric bed was studied in anesthetized portal hypertensive rats with various degrees and/or duration of portal vein stenosis. The shunting from the mesenteric bed averaged 66.7 +/- 29.9% (range 5.1-99.1%) and was influenced both by the degree and duration of portal vein stenosis. In contrast, shunting from the splenic bed averaged 97.3 +/- 4.0% (range 79-99.9%) and demonstrated no variation between groups determined by the degree of portal vein stenosis. The shunting from the splenic bed was consistently greater than that found from the mesenteric bed. Mesenteric but not splenic shunting correlated with serum bile acid levels. Mesenteric shunting was related inversely to the weight-adjusted liver mass and to serum testosterone levels. Based upon these data obtained in portal hypertensive rats, it is concluded that splenic injections of microspheres overestimate portal-systemic shunting. In contrast, mesenteric injections of microspheres yield values for shunting that correlate well with independently determined biochemical and endocrine consequences of shunting. These observations support the validity of the mesenteric shunting measurements obtained.\r"

Based on previous reports of its efficacy, we evaluated the impact of rifampin on the pruritus associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. Fourteen patients were included in a randomized, crossover study. After a 15-day washout period, subjects were followed for three weeks. During the first and third week, patients received 600 mg of rifampin or placebo; no treatment was administered during the second week. Pruritus was subjectively scored on a scale from 0 to 100. With rifampin, pruritus disappeared in 11 patients and partially improved in three; with placebo, only two had a partial response (P less than 0.001). Six patients with a prior poor or no response to cholestyramine improved with rifampin. No changes in biochemical tests or side effects were observed during this period. We conclude that short-term administration of rifampin relieves pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis. When administered over a period of eight months in an open study, the relief of pruritus was maintained, while one individual developed an allergic reaction. Rifampin appears to be a safe drug in the management of the pruritus of primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of CyA on the hepatic transport of bromosulfophthalein (BSP). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with CyA at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg (treated animals) or solvent (controls) during three weeks. Hepatic uptake of BSP (assessed by the plasma disappearance curve of the dye) and biliary secretion during infusions (95.5 and 178 nmol/min/100 g) were examined in both groups. Administration of CyA resulted in a decrease in both bile flow and BSP biliary secretion at the two infusion rates used. BSP plasma disappearance rate was significantly lower in treated animals than in controls. Conjugation of the dye was unaffected by CyA. There was no modification in ALT activity or in liver histology. These data show that chronic administration of CyA in rats decreases both hepatic uptake and biliary secretion of BSP. Thus, the inhibitory effect of CyA on biliary secretion is not limited to bile salts but also is observed with other cholephilic substances.\r"

Fewer elderly subjects complained of chest pain (27% vs 53%), and the pain was significantly less severe (P less than 0.01). Other presenting features (including sex, duration of symptoms, and presence and severity of dysphagia) did not differ between the groups. Across all patients, age weakly and inversely correlated with residual postdeglutitive lower esophageal sphincter; (LES) pressure (R = -0.34), and residual pressure was significantly lower in the older subjects (8.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs. 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.02). No differences in basal LES pressure or esophageal-body contraction amplitudes were present between the groups. Initial success with pneumatic dilation was similar in the two subject groups, but the number of older subjects available for analysis was too small to draw strong conclusions. These results indicate that aging decreases the elevation of LES residual pressure that occurs with achalasia. As elderly achalasia patients also present with less chest pain, the findings may be interrelated.\r"

In 19 of these 37 patients, the familiar chest pain could be reproduced by esophageal provocative testing without ischemic ST-T segment alterations; six of these 19 patients had also a positive 24-hr pH and pressure recording. These data strongly suggest an esophageal origin of chest pain in half the patients with typical angina and a normal coronary angiogram.\r"

This assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor is a sandwich method consisting of three steps. The standard curve for human hepatocyte growth factor appeared to be linear in the range of 0.20 to 12.50 ng purified human hepatocyte growth factor/ml (2.35 to 147 pmol/L). The assay took about 4 hr. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor values in patients with fulminant hepatic failure measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a strong positive correlation with that by bioassay using rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The mean value of serum human hepatocyte growth factor for 30 normal subjects was 0.24 +/- 0.12 (S.D.) ng/ml; that for 23 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was 8.06 +/- 1.76 (S.E.M.) ng/ml- greater than 30 times greater than the mean value for normal subjects. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor levels in patients with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were found to be slightly higher than those in normal subjects, but only the increase in serum human hepatocyte growth factor of acute hepatitis patients was statistically significant. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor should prove useful for serum human hepatocyte growth factor level measurement in patients with various liver diseases.\r"

Nine of the gallstone patients were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid and seven were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, 15 mg/kg/day, for 3 wk before cholecystectomy. The vesicular and micellar fractions in bile were separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and a clear separation between the two phases was obtained. The vesicles were further identified by quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy and appeared to be of a uniform size with a mean hydrodynamic radius of 760 A. The proportion of cholesterol in the vesicular fraction was significantly higher in the untreated gallstone group (40% +/- 4%) compared with the gallstone-free (28% +/- 3%), ursodeoxycholic acid (28% +/- 3%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (18% +/- 4%) groups. Despite a low cholesterol saturation of bile in the latter three groups (88% +/- 12%, 51% +/- 9% and 65% +/- 5%, respectively), a considerable part of the biliary cholesterol was carried in the vesicular fraction. The cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in the vesicular fraction averaged between 0.49 and 0.58 in the gallstone, gallstone-free and chenodeoxycholic acid groups, whereas the ursodeoxycholic acid group had a significantly lower ratio of 0.24. The nucleation time of bile from the gallstone group was short (2 +/- 1 days) compared with the gallstone-free, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid groups (23 +/- 3, 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 days, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hepatic, azygos and renal veins were catheterized before and after intravenous administration of fenoldopam, 0.05 micrograms/kg/min for 1 hr and increased to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min for another hour. Mean arterial pressure progressively decreased (from 83 +/- 7 to a minimum of 77 +/- 8 mm Hg 100 min after starting the infusion) but returned to baseline level at 120 min. Plasma norepinephrine and renin activity increased (respectively from 567 +/- 297 to 919 +/- 375 pg/ml, p less than 0.05, and from 17 +/- 14 to 23 +/- 15 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05). Renal blood flow, urine output or sodium excretion did not change. Sodium output decreased at 1 hr from 6.9 mumol/min to 4.0 mumol/min, p less than 0.05. Both hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow significantly increased by 21%. We conclude that the acute administration of fenoldopam did not improve renal hemodynamics or function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In addition, dopamine DA1 agonism caused further increases in norepinephrine concentration and plasma renin activity. Portal pressure also increased, probably because of an increase in mesenteric blood flow. These results question the renal benefit and raise concern about the use of dopamine agonists in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.\r"

Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference.\r"

The results showed a significant increase in the frequency of the antigens B8 and DR3 compared with controls (53% vs. 23%, p less than 0.0005, and 56% vs. 21%, p less than 0.0005). This was caused by a significant rise in the frequency of the human leukocyte antigen A1 B8 DR3 haplotype (32 of 81 patients, 40% vs. 12 of 100 patients, 12%, p less than 0.0005). By contrast, a significant reduction was seen in the frequency of the antigens B44 and DR4 (12% vs. 31%, p less than 0.005, and 12% vs. 34%, p less than 0.001, pc less than 0.011) because of the complete absence of the B44 DR4 haplotype in the patient group (p = 0.027, Fisher's exact test). When all the DR3-positive individuals (including the DR2/DR3 heterozygotes) were eliminated, a significant secondary association with DR2 was noted, 25 (69%) of 36 remaining patients being DR2-positive compared with 27 (34%) of 79 DR3 negative controls (p less than 0.0005, pc less than 0.006). Only 9% of the patients were DR2-positive and DR3-positive. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that survival was not influenced by the presence of either haplotype nor by the individual antigens. Patients who were DR3-positive were first seen at a significantly younger age than those who were DR2-positive (mean ages = 33 yr and 44 yr, respectively, p less than 0.002, Student's t test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with murine monoclonal antibodies raised against glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin to detect native albumin polymer in human serum and its cross-reactivity with other albumin polymers. Presence of polymerized albumin receptor on the HepG2 cell was studied by radioreceptor assay. Purified hepatitis B virus and synthetic peptide analogous to part of pre-S2 sequence (120-145) were used to study polymerized albumin-dependent attachment of the virus to HepG2 cells. Antibodies raised against pre-S2 peptide were used to inhibit the pre-S2 and hepatitis B virus attachment to HepG2 cells. Glutaraldehyde-treated polymerized albumin was found to be immunologically cross-reactive with native albumin polymer. Its levels were found to be significantly raised in sera of patients with liver diseases. Polymerized albumin has specific saturable receptor on HepG2 cells with two classes of binding sites of different equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd1 = (16 +/- 9.6)pmol/L and Kd2 = (1,019 +/- 172)pmol/L. Albumin monomer was unable to compete for the polymerized albumin receptor sites on HepG2 cells. Anti-pre-S2 antibodies inhibit hepatitis B virus and pre-S2 binding to hepatocyte by 40% and 70%, respectively. Added extraneous polymerized albumin and the antibody against it did not interfere with virus attachment to HepG2 cells.\r"

Using an adenovirus-based eukaryotic vector, the 17 kD X protein was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Cellular extracts containing the eukaryotic X protein have been used to screen for anti-HBx antibodies by immunoblot analysis in a large panel of sera from patients affected by hepatitis B virus chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute viral hepatitis. Sera from 32 of 171 (19%) chronic hepatitis B virus patients were positive for anti-HBx antibodies. Only one of thirty-two (3%) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive chronic hepatitis serum was anti-HBx positive. Very few sera from primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positivity for anti-HBx (8 of 149 or 5%). Anti-HBx were also detected in 8 of 48 (17%) acute viral hepatitis patients. In the four cases that were followed up weekly, anti-HBx antibodies appeared 3 to 4 wk after the onset of the clinical signs. To compare the X protein expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as a substrate for anti-HBx antibody detection, 171 sera were screened with HBx fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The prokaryotic cell extract test seems to be more sensitive. During the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection, the presence of anti-HBx antibodies detected with the eukaryotic cell extract correlates with the presence of well-established markers of ongoing viral replication: serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (p less than 0.001) and intrahepatic HBcAg expression (p less than 0.001).\r"

In 13 patients late changes in the grafts were similar to those described in other series: minor abnormalities in five cases, chronic active hepatitis in five cases and non-hepatitis B virus-related graft dysfunction in three cases. Three patients had incomplete histological follow-up. Analysis of the histological changes and viral antigen expression in six cases revealed a distinct and novel pattern termed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Development of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis was associated with rapidly progressive graft dysfunction. It is postulated that this pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops because of a high cytoplasmic expression of viral antigens, including HBsAg. The remaining case had some features of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. The main histological features of this unique syndrome include thin, perisinusoidal bands of fibrosis extending from portal tracts to surround plates of ductular-type epithelium; prominent cholestasis; ground-glass transformation; and ballooning of hepatocytes with cell loss and mild mixed inflammatory reaction.\r"

Hepatitis B virus DNA was detectable in the serum of HBsAg-positive virus carriers using aliquots as small as 100 al. The detection limit for cloned hepatitis B virus DNA was 100 ag. Primer pairs for different regions of the HBV genome resulted in different sensitivity. Detection of the amplified hepatitis B virus DNA by Southern blotting and subsequent scintillation counting or densitometry allowed a semiquantitative assay. Using several primer pairs in parallel for optimal detection, all HBeAg-positive HBsAg carriers, 80% of HBe antibody-positive symptomatic HBsAg carriers and 57% of asymptomatic HBe antibody-positive HBsAg carriers were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum. During antiviral therapy hepatitis B virus DNA disappeared by the polymerase chain reaction assay in patients who became HBeAg negative, but polymerase chain reaction detected a relapse earlier than did the conventional dot blot. Pre-S antigens were assayed in serum and liver samples from most chronic carriers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or immunoblot. Although most viremic carriers were strongly positive for pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens, some hepatitis B virus DNA-positive HBsAg carriers did not have detectable pre-S antigens, and vice versa. Our data show that assay of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum by polymerase chain reaction is by far more proficient than by dot blot and that it cannot be replaced by serological assays of HBeAg or pre-S antigen.\r"

Restriction endonuclease analysis by double digestion with MspI and HpaII revealed that DNAs from two of 21 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were affected by nucleotide substitution at the twelfth amino acid coding sequence of the c-Ha-ras gene. DNAs from cirrhotic noncancerous liver tissue, but not leukocytes, of one of these patients possessed the mutation, whereas DNAs from noncirrhotic liver tissue and leukocytes of the other patient did not. In one of the nine patients harboring heterozygosity for c-Ha-ras-related BamHI-fragments, the loss of one allele was demonstrated as a somatic change not only in DNA from the tumor tissue but also in DNA from the cirrhotic nontumorous tissue. In two of the 19 patients comparatively examined for digestion patterns of c-Ha-ras locus with HpaII and MspI, extensive methylation was observed as a somatic modification in both DNAs from the tumor and the cirrhotic nontumorous tissues. These results thus indicate that the genetic lesions affecting the c-Ha-ras gene do occur in human hepatocellular carcinoma and probably serve as one of the multiple steps in the process of hepatic carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Cell-CAM 105 has been identified as a cell adhesion molecule based on the ability of anti-cell-CAM 105 monospecific Fab fragments to inhibit the reaggregation of rat hepatocytes. Because of its adhesive properties, it was expected that cell-CAM 105 would be present on the lateral cell surface where adhesive interactions predominate. Paradoxically, however, immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections of rat liver using specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that cell-CAM 105 was present exclusively in the bile canalicular domain of the rat hepatocyte where there is no intercellular adhesion. To more precisely define the in situ localization of cell-CAM 105, immunoperoxidase labeling and electron microscopy were used to examine intact and mechanically dissociated liver tissue. Results showed that when accessibility was provided by mechanical dissociation of perfusion fixed liver tissue, cell-CAM 105 could be detected in the pericanalicular region of lateral membranes. In contrast, when hepatocytes were labeled after incubation in vitro under conditions used during adhesion assays to induce reaggregation, cell-CAM 105 rapidly redistributed to all areas of the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary hepatocyte cultures further revealed that cell-CAM 105 and two other bile canalicular proteins relocalized to discrete domains reminiscent of bile canaliculi, whereas cell-CAM 105 was also present in areas of intercellular contact. Serial section electron microscopy analysis of well-defined, cross-sectional profiles of bile canaliculi suggested the presence of cell-CAM 105-positive membrane folds that extended along the length of the bile canalicular border. In sections from livers in which calcium-dependent adhesive contacts had been disrupted by treatment with ethylenediamine tetraacetate, intact bile canaliculi were found that remained attached only by these border folds. The implications of these results are discussed with regard to a possible role for cell-CAM 105 in bile canalicular formation.\r"

It was found that cytosolic fractions of mouse, rat and human liver, as well as isolated rat hepatocytes, contain a large amount of growth stimulatory activity. Most liver cytosolic activity is due to heparin-binding growth factors, because greater than 90% of the activity bound to a heparin affinity column in the presence of 0.8 mol/L NaCl, and was quantitatively eluted with 2 mol/L NaCl. Purification of these factors from both mouse and rat liver indicated the presence of both heparin-binding growth factor-1 and 2 in liver extracts. The level of the heparin-binding growth factors, as estimated from the biological activity, is approximately 1 microgram/gm mouse liver and 0.1 microgram/gm rat and human liver. Heparin-binding growth factor-1-like factors were 10 times as abundant as heparin-binding growth factor-2-like factors. These data indicate that the cytosolic fractions of mouse, rat and human liver contain heparin-binding growth factors as the primary growth factor for fibroblasts, and heparin binding growth factor-1-like molecules account for most of the cytosolic activity in both mouse and rat liver.\r"

Recent work from our group has suggested the possible importance of relative hydrophobicity among various organic anions in hepatic uptake. To further validate and clarify this, we studied hepatic extraction of five different cholephilic dyes using the isolated perfused rat liver in single-pass mode. Albumin binding affinities and capacities for each of the ligands were measured in vitro to permit evaluation of in vivo interactions for each of them over a spectrum of unbound ligand concentrations. As expected, a strong positive correlation was found between ligand hydrophobicity and the relative degree of albumin binding affinity and capacity. Using appropriate experimental conditions, we also found a strong positive correlation between hepatic extraction efficiency for a given ligand and both its hydrophobicity and its unbound concentration. These data indicate that where the unbound ligand concentration is significant, the greater the ligand hydrophobicity, the greater is its efficiency of hepatic extraction. We conclude that hepatic extraction efficiency for non-bile-salt cholephilic organic anions depends on a combination of ligand hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance and the availability of the unbound ligand for uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Trihydroxy bile acids with differing nonsterol chain length and charge were synthesized to define the effect of these parameters on the ability to competitively inhibit the Na(+)-dependent uptake of 14C taurocholate into isolated rat hepatocytes. Compounds with long side chains (greater than or equal to 0.8 nm) beyond carbon-17 of the sterol nucleus and carrying a negative charge or no charge were potent inhibitors. Introduction of a positive charge into the side chain weakened inhibition. When the length of the chain beyond carbon-17 fell below about 0.7 nm, charge still influenced inhibitory potency, but the effect was reversed and positively-charged chains yielded slightly greater inhibition than negatively-charged chains. From these results one may postulate a positively-charged cell surface domain extending outward from a point about 0.7 nm from the sterol nucleus receptor region. Up to about 0.7 nm from the sterol nucleus receptor region one might postulate a negative cell surface charge to account for the weaker inhibitory potency of compounds with short negatively-charged chains. Nonetheless, a short chain, regardless of charge, weakened inhibition, suggesting that a long negatively-charged side chain is necessary to orient the sterol moiety for optimal receptor fit. These data confirm that the Na(+)-dependent taurocholate transport site is sensitive to alterations of side chain charge and length and emphasize the importance of structure when designing bile acid analogs to probe taurocholate transport mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "91106969\r", 
  ".W": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes are known to display various functional differences. In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities.\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion injury characterized by loss of endothelial cell viability occurs after cold ischemic storage of livers for transplantation surgery. Here, ultrastructural changes in stored rat livers were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. With increasing times of storage in Euro-Collins solution (4 to 24 hr) followed by 15 min of reperfusion at 37 degrees C, a sequence of structural alterations was observed involving endothelial and Kupffer cells. Widening of endothelial fenestrations occurred after 4 hr and progressed over 8 to 24 hr to retraction of cellular processes, ball-like rounding, sinusoidal denudation and ultrastructural derangements consistent with loss of cell viability. Kupffer cells exhibited progressive rounding, ruffling of the cell surface, polarization, appearance of wormlike densities, vacuolization and degranulation over a similar time course. By contrast, the structures of parenchymal and fat-storing cells were relatively undisturbed by cold storage and reperfusion. Alterations to endothelial and Kupffer cells were also studied as a function of time of reperfusion. After 24 hr of storage, endothelial cells showed retraction of cytoplasm before reperfusion that progressed quickly to loss of viability and denudation during reperfusion. Kupffer cell activation (ruffling, degranulation) during reperfusion was slower and occurred after deterioration of endothelial cells. Livers stored in Euro-Collins solution were also compared with livers stored in University of Wisconsin cold storage solution, an improved preservation medium for transplantation. University of Wisconsin solution provided better preservation of endothelial structure and markedly reduced parenchymal cell blebbing and swelling before reperfusion. University of Wisconsin solution also reduced Kupffer cell activation and release of lysosomal enzymes. In conclusion, endothelial cell deterioration followed by Kupffer cell activation occurred after increasing times of cold ischemic storage and reperfusion of rat livers. Both changes may contribute to the pathophysiology of graft failure caused by reperfusion-mediated storage injury.\r"

To resolve this issue, 4- to 6-wk-old male Balb C mice were given, by intravenous injection, 12,800 hemagglutination units of influenza B Lee/40 virus in phosphate buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin using virus prepared by ultra-centrifugation from infected allantoic fluid, by sucrose density-gradient purification of virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid or by irradiation of virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid to inactivate virus. The infectivity titer of virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid was much higher than that of sucrose density-gradient purified virus prepared from infected allantoic fluid: 50% egg infectious dose for virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid was 3.9 x 10(4)/hemagglutination unit vs. 8.7 50% egg infectious dose/hemagglutination unit for sucrose density-gradient purified virus prepared from infected allantoic fluid. Control mice received phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin or uninfected allantoic fluid diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin. Mice were fasted to eliminate dietary variation, and livers were obtained 36 hr after virus administration. Of the above treatments, only virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid caused clinical illness and increased hepatic triglycerides (p less than 0.02) compared with controls. Hepatic triglycerides in virus prepared by ultracentrifugation from infected allantoic fluid correlated with histopathological vacuolization scores (r = 0.5773; p less than 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reactivity was significantly lower during the cluster period, but only in the ACA on the side of the headache.

In 3 out of 6 patients in an active cluster period, we describe a lesion on Gallium single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in the region of the cavernous sinus which fades as the patient moves out of cluster.

During the tests, all the subjects were asked to inhale 12% oxygen (88% N2) for 30 min, and the decreasing oxygen saturation (SaO2%) was monitored. Patients in the remission period showed nearly the same decrement of SaO2% as controls. At the end of the test, patients in the bout showed significantly less reduction of SaO2% than the controls. In 5 patients, the test was carried out both in and outside the cluster periods. The tendency to less decrement in oxygen saturation in the cluster phase was as marked with this comparison, but the difference between the groups was not significant, probably partly due to the low number of tests carried out. Only one patient got a typical attack. It seems that hypoxia of this magnitude per se is not the cause of attacks. The different pattern with respect to SaO2% following 12% O2 inhalation in cluster headache may be due to an abnormality in central regulation and/or chemoreceptor sensitivity.\r"

In addition to the evaluation of headache complaints, psychological distress among students was measured with respect to their experience of somatic complaints, depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms. Although self-help relaxation training significantly decreased the severity and annoyance of adolescents' headache besides their somatic complaints, the clinical improvement of headache was modest. The addition of chlormezanone did not help those who were nonresponders to self-help relaxation training. Finally, a set of pretreatment variables consisting of baseline headache severity and annoyance, experience of anxiety and daily life stress among adolescents could predict outcome of self-help relaxation therapy.\r"

Plasma concentration of tiaprofenic acid was determined by HPLC analysis. Drug absorption appeared to be the same during and out of migraine attacks (absorption half life: during attack, 0.249 +/- 0.122 hr; out of attack, 0.249 +/- 0.105 hr; maximum plasma concentration: during attack, 37.8 +/- 9.8 ug/ml; out of attack, 40.1 +/- 13.2 ug/ml). The other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were not affected by headache attacks as well. We conclude that tiaprofenic acid absorption and metabolism are not affected by migraine attacks. Also, our data suggest that tiaprofenic acid might be useful in the treatment of migraine.\r"

The effects of sumatriptan in various experimental paradigms have led to new insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. At the clinical level, sumatriptan appears to be an effective abortive anti-migraine agent with minimal side effects. Its ability to decrease, rather than exacerbate, the nausea and vomiting of migraine appears to be an important advance in the treatment of migraine.\r"

Significant relationships were found between the fact that a nurse had previously cared for donors and the degree of comfort felt in obtaining consent, extent to which the nurse would participate in care, and knowledge of organ procurement procedures. The nurses' feelings regarding donation and their degree of comfort in obtaining consent were correlated positively with higher knowledge scores. Knowledge deficits were identified in all areas. Results indicated that although most nurses were supportive of organ procurement, there were aspects with which they were uncomfortable and others in which they lacked knowledge. The study revealed the need for additional awareness and education of nurses in all areas of the organ donation process.\r"

To control for handedness, the skin preparation site was randomly assigned to either the left or right forearm. One-tailed paired t-test analyses were used to compare differences between treatment arms and control arms within each group (p less than 0.05). Skin preparation done by using One Step Skin Prep or the ECG Prep Pads used once significantly decreased skin potentials by 2.3 mV and 3.3 mV respectively. There was no significant difference in the control group and the group in which ECG Prep Pads were used five times. These findings extend the knowledge of techniques available to reduce the amount of noise (electrical potential) in physiologic measurement using skin electrodes.\r"

Pearson correlation coefficients indicated significant positive correlations between health locus of control variables, health value orientation variations, and wellness motivation. Health locus of control and health value orientation variables entered into a multiple regression equation to explain 32% of the variation in wellness motivation. Awareness of individual motivational responses that influence health behaviors in cardiac rehabilitation may enable nurses to develop intervention strategies for patients with cardiovascular disease who would benefit from modifying their risk-producing life-styles.\r"

The administration of local anesthetics into the pleural space is a technique of providing analgesia of rapid onset and long duration. This analgesia is accomplished without causing the respiratory depression or sedation associated with the use of opioids. Because innovative analgesic methods are often selected for critically ill patients presenting after surgery in the intensive care setting, critical care nurses may encounter patients receiving local anesthetics administered via interpleural catheter.\r"

Within these ICUs are a growing population of patients whose stays are extensively prolonged because of complications or underlying chronic health conditions that are exacerbated by a critical illness. These patients can be described as \"chronically critically ill\" and are costly to hospitals both in terms of actual dollars and in terms of the burden of care to nurses and physicians. This article describes the creation of a special care unit (SCU) designed specifically to meet the needs of chronically critically ill patients. The SCU environment is composed of a physical design that accommodates limited technology and care aimed at family involvement and rehabilitation, a case management practice model, and a shared governance management model. This structure is in contrast to traditional ICU environments, which include physical layouts that allow for high technology and close monitoring of patients, a primary nursing delivery system, and a bureaucratic management model. A research project to compare the effects of the SCU with the effects of the traditional ICUs on nurse and patient outcomes is described.\r"

The nurses' answers concerning the agent best able to support patient autonomy in the DNR decision were in general agreement with the do not resuscitate decision model developed by the principal investigator (B.B.O.) to demonstrate support for patient autonomy in the DNR decision. However, when asked who would actually make the DNR decision on their units, the nurses frequently responded that the physician would make the decision, regardless of the agent selected as best able to support patient autonomy in the case situation. An ethical conflict concerning the DNR decision appeared to exist for the majority of the subjects in this study.\r"

Therapeutic principles have been developed for each etiologic type. End points for such therapy have included optimization of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, blood pressure, and urine output. Recent investigators agree that the common denominator in each of the shock syndromes is a reduction in the amount of oxygen consumed by the cell. The logical therapeutic approach would be to increase oxygen delivery to support the increased metabolic demand of the cells. The end point of resuscitation should be optimization of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. These variables are easily calculated by using data obtained from pulmonary artery catheter and laboratory measurements. The physician or nurse caring for critical ill patients should have a thorough understanding of the rationale for the use of oxygen transport calculations and the methods of manipulating oxygen delivery. A simple explanation of these principles including the importance of hemoglobin, cardiac index, and percent saturation of hemoglobin and suggested treatment strategies are presented.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Treatment group 1 (n = 11) received teaching, treadmill exercise testing, and exercise training (three times weekly for 5 weeks). Treatment group 2 (n = 15) received only teaching and exercise testing. The control group (n = 14) received only routine care without supervised exercise or teaching. Measurements of self-efficacy and activity performance were made at hospital discharge and at 4 and 9 weeks after the cardiac event. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed an increase in self-efficacy scores (p less than 0.001) and performance of physical activity (p less than 0.001) for all groups. Both treatment groups, especially the training group, obtained the highest scores, but differences between groups were nonsignificant (p greater than 0.05). These results indicate that in a sample of uncomplicated, motivated patients who had participated in a phase 1 inpatient rehabilitation program, substantial improvements in self-efficacy and performance of daily activities were made early in recovery, before the onset of phase 2, formalized outpatient therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular control of intramuscular triglyceride (TG) metabolism involves two major identified lipases: hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Recently, the presence of HSL in muscle has been unequivocally demonstrated. However, although it is thought that HSL is responsible for intramuscular TG lipolysis, direct evidence for this is lacking. There is evidence to suggest that HSL and LPL are simultaneously activated under a variety of conditions. The two muscle lipases appear to be turned on by the same signal and function as a coordinated unit in meeting the energy demands of muscle. At a time when HSL is presumably hydrolyzing endogenous TG, LPL is sent to the capillary beds in search of substrate. TG uptake from circulation is highly related to muscle LPL activity. Exercise training increases LPL activity in plasma and in parenchymal cells in muscle. These results suggest that training may increase the capacity to clear TG from circulation and that LPL might have a role in replenishing muscle TG stores that have been decreased with exercise.\r"

  ".W": "To study the distribution of blood flow after blood volume expansion, seven miniature swine ran at high speed (17.6-20 km/h, estimated to require 115% of maximal O2 uptake) on a motor-driven treadmill on two occasions: once during normovolemia and once after an acute 15% blood volume expansion (homologous whole blood). O2 uptake, cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and distribution of blood flow (with radiolabeled microspheres) were measured at the same time during each of the exercise bouts. Maximal heart rate was identical between conditions (mean 266); mean arterial pressure was elevated during the hypovolemic exercise (149 +/- 5 vs. 137 +/- 6 mmHg). Although cardiac output was higher and arterial O2 saturation was maintained during the hypervolemic condition (10.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.3 +/- 0.6 l/min), O2 uptake was not different (1.74 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.74 +/- 0.09 l/min). Mean blood flows to cardiac (+12.9%), locomotory (+9.8%), and respiratory (+7.5%) muscles were all elevated during hypervolemic exercise, while visceral and brain blood flows were unchanged. Calculated resistances to flow in skeletal and cardiac muscle were not different between conditions. Under the experimental conditions of this study, O2 uptake in the miniature swine was limited at the level of the muscles during hypervolemic exercise. The results also indicate that neither intrinsic contractile properties of the heart nor coronary blood flow limits myocardial performance during normovolemic exercise, because both the pumping capacity of the heart and the coronary blood flow were elevated in the hypervolemic condition.\r"

  ".W": "Mean arterial pressure (Pa), heart rate, cardiac output (Q), and Q distribution (with radiolabeled microspheres) were measured in miniature swine as they ran at high levels on a motor-driven treadmill. Each animal ran on two occasions: once during exercise at maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) and once at an intensity estimated to require approximately 115% VO2max. The purpose was to assess these cardiovascular variables to determine whether the calculated resistance to blood flow during supramaximal exercise was different from that during maximal exercise. A total of 114 tissues/organs were dissected for blood flow analysis. Pa and Q were unaltered between the two exercise conditions. Blood flow to all but one of the 62 skeletal muscles sampled was unchanged between conditions as were the blood flows to the visceral organs and brain. The results demonstrate that vascular resistance was constant in all these tissues between maximal and supramaximal exercise intensities. Elevated blood flows were measured in 7 of the 11 coronary sites sampled. Calculated resistance to blood flow indicated that a decrease in resistance occurred in most of the samples having elevated blood flow. Because heart rate was elevated during the supramaximal exercise, the increase in blood flow was probably in response to the greater myocardial work and concomitant elevation in O2 demand. In summary, it was shown that Pa, Q, and Q distribution in most tissues remained unchanged during exercise at intensities above VO2max. Thus a precise matching occurs between the increasingly powerful vasoconstrictor drive initiated by the sympathetic nervous system and the elevated local vasodilatory drive responding to the greater O2 demand during the supramaximal exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

EFS caused contraction alone in tissues at the baseline tension and biphasic responses (contraction and relaxation) in tissues precontracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine. Contraction was abolished by atropine (10(-6) M), and relaxation was abolished by tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). At the baseline tension, EFS at frequencies greater than 10 Hz inhibited the subsequent (4 min later) contraction induced by EFS at 1-5 Hz. EFS-induced inhibition was stimulus frequency dependent and reached maximum at 20 Hz. However, EFS at 20 Hz did not inhibit the subsequent contractile response to acetylcholine (10(-7) to 10(-3) M). Exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal peptide mimicked EFS-induced inhibitory effects, but substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide did not. The inhibitory effect of EFS at 20 Hz was not altered by pyrilamine, cimetidine, naloxone, methysergide, phentolamine, BW755C, AF-DX 116, or removal of epithelium. These results imply that the NANC transmitter acts via presynaptic cholinergic receptors.\r"

To determine if this increase is via an enzymatic or receptor-mediated mechanism, enzymatically active forms of alpha-thrombin and enzymatically inactive forms with cell binding activity were incubated with the monolayers. Enzymatic forms included alpha-thrombin and two digestion products, zeta-thrombin (chymotryptic product with 89% clotting activity) and gamma-thrombin (tryptic product). Enzymatically inactive forms included D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone-(PPACK) alpha-thrombin and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate-(DIP) alpha-thrombin. Cell binding activity of alpha- and PPACK-alpha-thrombin was demonstrated to be similar to each other and comparable to that cited in the literature for DIP-alpha-thrombin. gamma-Thrombin, on the other hand, did not compete for binding of 125I-labeled alpha-thrombin. All enzymatic forms of alpha-thrombin increased endothelial permeability as assessed by the clearance of 125I-albumin across the monolayers. Coincubation of PPACK, an enzymatic site inhibitor, with alpha- or gamma-thrombin prevented the increase in permeability, further indicating that alpha-thrombin increased permeability by its enzymatic activity. Both enzymatically inactive forms of alpha-thrombin with high-affinity binding activity had no effect on permeability. To further examine whether cell binding activity of alpha-thrombin contributed to the increased permeability, a sulfated COOH-terminal fragment of hirudin (hirugen) that binds to the anion-binding site of alpha-thrombin but, unlike hirudin, does not interact with the catalytic site was coincubated with alpha-thrombin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we studied the coordination of sucks, swallows, and breaths in healthy infants (8 full-term and 5 preterm). Respiratory movements and airflow were recorded as were sucks and swallows (intraoral and intrapharyngeal pressure). Sucks did not interrupt breathing or decrease minute ventilation during nonnutritive sucking. Minute ventilation during bottle feedings was inversely related to swallow frequency, with elimination of ventilation as the swallowing frequency approached 1.4/s. Swallows were associated with a 600-ms period of decreased respiratory initiation and with a period of airway closure lasting 530 +/- 9.8 (SE) ms. Occasional periods of prolonged airway closure were observed in all infants during feedings. Respiratory efforts during airway closure (obstructed breaths) were common. The present findings indicate that the decreased ventilation observed during bottle feedings is primarily a consequence of airway closure associated with the act of swallowing, whereas the decreased ventilatory efforts result from respiratory inhibition during swallows.\r"

Therefore we studied 11 late-gestation chronically prepared fetal sheep during positive-pressure ventilation with different gas mixtures to determine the roles of mechanical distension and blood gas tensions on pressure-flow relationships in the lung. Ventilation with 3% O2-7% CO2 produced a substantial fall in pulmonary vascular resistance even though arterial blood gases were not changed. Increases in pulmonary arterial PO2 during ventilation were associated with falls in pulmonary vascular resistance beyond that measured during mechanical distension. Decreases in pulmonary arterial PCO2 and associated increases in pH were also associated with falls in pulmonary vascular resistance. Pulmonary blood flow ceased at a pulmonary arterial pressure that exceeded left atrial pressure, indicating that left atrial pressure does not represent the true downstream component of driving pressure through the pulmonary vascular bed. The slope of the driving pressure-flow relationship in the normal mature fetal lamb was therefore different from the ratio of pulmonary arterial pressure to pulmonary arterial flow. We conclude that mechanical ventilation, increased PO2 and decreased PCO2, and/or increased pH has an important influence on the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance elicited by positive pressure in utero ventilation of the fetal lamb and that the downstream driving pressure for pulmonary blood flow exceeds left atrial pressure.\r"

This procedure involved injecting 5-6 ml of [55Fe]ferrous citrate solution (1 mCi/ml) intraperitoneally into donor rats. The number of labeled RBCs reached a maximum at around 7 days and declined very slowly thereafter. Labeled RBCs were harvested from donor rats and used for RBC volume measurement in awake rats. Brain radioactivity was assayed by QAR, which yielded spatial resolution of greater than 50 microns. Tight nearly irreversible binding of 55Fe to RBCs was found in vivo and in vitro. More than 99.5% of the 55Fe in the blood of donor rats was bound to RBCs. Because of this, labeled blood can be taken from donors and injected into recipients without further preparation. The tissue absorption of 55Fe emissions was the same in gray and white matter. Microvascular RBC volumes measured with 55Fe-labeled RBCs agreed with those assayed with 51Cr-labeled RBCs for many, but not all, brain areas. In conclusion, 55Fe-RBCs can be readily prepared by this technique and accurately quantitated in brain tissue by QAR.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma fibronectin, also called cold-insoluble globulin, is a cryoprecipitable glycoprotein with both opsonic and adhesive activities. It binds to collagen, actin, and heparin and can form soluble as well as cryoprecipitable complexes in the cold. Fibronectin augments particulate phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system and can influence lung vascular permeability. Plasma fibronectin deficiency is temporally associated with respiratory failure in septic surgical, trauma, and burn patients. We measured plasma fibronectin and albumin levels in nine adults undergoing elective cardiopulmonary bypass to determine whether dilution alone could account for the changes in plasma fibronectin. Plasma fibronectin concentration decreased 17% with the surgical trauma of opening of the chest and placement of the vascular cannulas. On heparinization and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, plasma fibronectin fell an additional 48% (P less than 0.001), whereas albumin concentration (corrected for albumin in the pump prime) fell only 25% (P less than 0.001), emphasizing that dilution was not the only mechanism contributing to the decline in plasma fibronectin. Fibronectin levels began to increase after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass and in association with diuresis, but unexpectedly they remained subnormal until 4 days postoperation. Thus the decline in fibronectin concentration with cardiopulmonary bypass may be due to dilution as well as opsonic consumption and possible complexing with heparin in the cold.\r"

During the 7 days before exercise, a high-carbohydrate diet was consumed (70% carbohydrate, 18% protein, 12% fat; 35 kcal/kg body weight). One hundred grams of either Polycose (placebo) or dihydroxyacetone and pyruvate (treatment, 3:1) were substituted for a portion of carbohydrate. Dietary conditions were randomized, and subjects consumed each diet separated by 7-14 days. After each diet, cycle ergometer exercise (70% of peak oxygen consumption) was performed to exhaustion. Biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle was obtained before and after exercise. Blood samples were drawn through radial artery and femoral vein catheters at rest, after 30 min of exercise, and at exercise termination. Leg endurance was 66 +/- 4 and 79 +/- 2 min after placebo and DHAP, respectively (P less than 0.01). Muscle glycogen at rest and exhaustion did not differ between diets. Whole leg arteriovenous glucose difference was greater (P less than 0.05) for DHAP than for placebo at rest (0.36 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.07 mM) and after 30 min of exercise (1.06 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.10 mM) but did not differ at exhaustion. Plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were similar during rest and exercise for both diets. Estimated total glucose oxidation during exercise was 165 +/- 17 and 203 +/- 15 g after placebo and DHAP, respectively (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that feeding of DHAP for 7 days in conjunction with a high carbohydrate diet enhances leg exercise endurance capacity by increasing glucose extraction by muscle.\r"

Normal isolated canine lung lobes (N, n = 14) and those injured with either airway acid instillation (AAI, n = 18) or intravascular oleic acid (OA, n = 25) were exposed to short (5-min) periods of elevated venous pressure (HiPv) ranging from 19 to 130 cmH2O.

However, the pattern of response to HiPv was similar in all groups: Kf,c was no different from the pre-HiPv value when the peak venous pressure (Pv) remained less than 55 cmH2O, but it increased reversibly when peak Pv exceeded 55 cmH2O (P less than 0.05). The reflection coefficient (sigma) for total proteins measured after pressure exposure averaged 0.60 +/- 0.03, 0.32 +/- 0.04, and 0.37 +/- 0.09 for N, AAI, and OA lobes respectively. However, in contrast to the result expected if pore stretching had occurred at high pressure, in all groups the sigma measured during the HiPv stress when Pv exceeded 55 cmH2O was significantly larger than that measured during the recovery period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During air breathing, there was a statistically significant decrease of resistance values at lower frequencies after inhalation of salbutamol. When the subject was equilibrated with 80% He-20% O2, total respiratory resistance markedly decreased at all frequencies, and a negative frequency dependence of resistance was observed between 8 and 20 Hz. Resistance values further decreased during He-O2 breathing after inhalation of salbutamol. After inhalation of salbutamol, reactance values increased during air and He-O2 breathing. The density-dependent decrease of the real part of impedance can be explained by a decrease of turbulence in the larger airways. The bronchodilating effect of salbutamol was not influenced by a change in the physical properties of the inhaled gas. During He-O2 breathing, reactance values significantly decreased, resulting in an increase of resonant frequency due to a decrease of inductive reactance. It is concluded that an increase in the capacitance of the respiratory system must be supposed to explain the increase in reactance values after inhalation of the beta-adrenergic agonist salbutamol.\r"

On 2 separate study days, each subject breathed 6-microns Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter 99mTc-labeled iron oxide particles under controlled breathing conditions while they were seated in front of a gamma camera. Retention (R) of lung activity was measured over the initial 2 h and again at 24 h after particle inhalation. On the control day the subject sat quietly in front of the camera, while on the cough day each subject performed 60 controlled coughs during the 1st h of retention measurements. By paired analysis, retentions at both 1 and 2 h (R1 and R2, respectively) for the cough measurements were significantly less than control (mean control R1 = 85% vs. mean cough R1 = 72%, P less than 0.002; mean control R2 = 75% vs. mean cough R2 = 65%, P less than 0.02). Retention at 24 h (R24) was not significantly different between cough and control measurements (mean cough R24 = 35% and mean control R24 = 32%). Thus coughing increased the rate at which the radiolabeled particles were cleared from the bronchial airways in these individuals. Follow-up experiments with subjects performing rapid inhalations rather than cough showed similar enhanced particle clearance to that seen with cough. These results suggest that the observed enhancement of mucus clearance by cough (and rapid inhalation) in the normal lung may be due to a stimulation of the mucociliary apparatus rather than via a two-phase gas-liquid flow mechanism.\r"

The experiments were performed on anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rabbits. Cerebral ischemia was induced by reversible intrathoracic occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian and both internal thoracic arteries for 15 min. The effect of cerebral ischemia on breathing pattern was assessed by monitoring the integrated activities of phrenic and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Ischemia produced enhancement of breathing followed by apnea and gasping. During enhanced breathing as well as during gasping, the inspiratory-inhibiting effect of lung inflation (Breuer-Hering reflex) was abolished. When brain circulation was restored, respiratory activity started with gasps, which later were intermingled with eupneic type of inspirations. During the onset of a eupneic breath, lung inflation produced inspiratory facilitation but never an inhibition. However, after 30 min of recovery from cerebral ischemia, the Breuer-Hering reflex was restored. Results show that precise analysis of vagal reflexes and respiratory pattern during ischemia and resuscitation may be used as an indicator of resumption of autonomic activity in the brain stem.\r"

In the present study we investigated this hypothesis by performing flow interruptions during relaxed expiration in normal, tracheostomized, anesthetized, paralyzed dogs while the lungs were filled with four different gas mixtures having widely varying physical properties. We found that the power spectrum of the oscillations exhibited two peaks. The larger peak was centered about a frequency that varied approximately linearly with the inverse of the square root of the gas density. The other peak was smaller and was located at approximately 70 Hz with all gas mixtures. The area under the power spectrum of the ringing varied approximately linearly with the density of the gas mixture. These results indicate that the larger peak in the power spectrum reflects the quarter-wave resonance of the gas in the airways, whereas the smaller peak reflects a tissue resonance.\r"

In 11 young men, a 60-min bout of exercise had no significant effect on the rate of glucose disposal during a euglycemic clamp performed approximately 30 min postexercise in which plasma insulin was raised to approximately 2,500 microU/ml (a maximal insulin stimulus). The maximal rate of glucose disposal attained during the clamp averaged 15.7 +/- 1.0 mg.kg lean body mass-1.min-1 after exercise vs. a control value of 15.4 mg.kg lean body mass-1.min-1. In a second experiment, eight men performed supine cycle exercise during the 3rd h of a 4-h euglycemic clamp with a plasma insulin concentration of approximately 2,500 microU/ml. Exercise during the hyperinsulinemic clamp resulted in a 70% increase in glucose disposal rate. There was no measurable increase in glucose 6-phosphate in the quadriceps muscle during the insulin infusion at rest. We conclude that prior exercise does not enhance maximally insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in young healthy men. Our results are compatible with the interpretations that glucose availability rather than glucose metabolism limits the rate of glucose disposal in response to a maximal insulin stimulus in resting subjects and that the increase in glucose uptake in response to superimposed exercise is primarily due to an increase in glucose availability.\r"

The observed water flux changes during different phases of exercise have been interpreted in terms of fluid transfer between the vasculature and exercising muscle. Good correlation between individual MVC and changes in water fluxes and the decay of water content was observed after 20% MVC exercise level.

Lead markers were sutured to the abdominal surface of the diaphragm along bundles of the left ventral, middle, and dorsal regions of the costal diaphragm and the left crural diaphragm of six beagle dogs. After 2-3 wk postoperative recovery, the dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and scanned prone and supine in the Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor (DSR) at a total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV). The location of each marker was digitized from the reconstructed DSR images, and in situ lengths were determined. After an overdose of anesthetic had been administered to the dogs, each marked diaphragm bundle was removed, mounted in a 37 degrees C in vitro chamber, and adjusted to Lo (maximum tetanic force). The operating length of the diaphragm, or in situ length expressed as percent Lo, varied from region to region at the lung volumes studied; variability was least at RV and increased with increasing lung volume. At FRC, all regions of the diaphragm was shorter in the prone posture compared with the supine, but there was no clear gravity-dependent vertical gradient of in situ length in either posture. Because in vitro length-tension characteristics were similar for all diaphragm regions, regional in vivo length differences indicate that the diaphragm's potential to generate maximal force is nonuniform.\r"

  ".W": "Previous results by use of a model of resistance exercise consisting of nonvoluntary electrical contraction of rat skeletal muscle have shown that significant gastrocnemius muscle enlargement was produced after 16 wk of chronic concentric resistance training with progressively increased weights but not after the same training program without weights (J. Appl. Physiol. 65: 950-954, 1988). In the present study we examined whether this differential effect on muscle mass between high- and low-resistance exercise is mediated through differential actions on muscle protein synthesis rates. In addition, we determined whether accumulation of specific mRNA quantities had a primary role in the protein synthesis response to this type of exercise. The data revealed that as little as 8 min of total contractile duration increased gastrocnemius protein synthesis rates by nearly 50%. Contrary to our hypothesis, post-exercise protein synthesis rates do not appear to be differentially regulated by the resistance imposed on the muscle during exercise but rather by the number of repetitions performed during the acute bout. This observation, the failure of high-frequency chronic training to produce gastrocnemius enlargement, and the relatively minor effects on mRNA levels collectively suggest that translational and posttranslational mechanisms, including protein degradation, may be the principal processes by which gastrocnemius protein expression is regulated in this model of stimulated concentric exercise.\r"

  ".W": "In another study (J. Appl. Physiol. 69: 1709-1717, 1990) we reported that gastrocnemius (GAST) muscle enlargement failed to occur after 10 wk of 192 contractions performed every 3rd or 4th day. This result was surprising because increased protein synthesis rates were determined after an initial acute exercise bout with the same paradigms. In the same set of animals, tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were enlarged 16-30% compared with sedentary control muscles after the same chronic training regimen. This indicated that the regulation of protein expression may be different between the GAST and TA muscles. The present experiment attempted to define and explain these differences by comparing changes in various indexes of protein metabolism in TA with the same parameters determined in the accompanying study for the GAST. As in the GAST, results showed that TA protein synthesis rates are increased by acute exercise and principally regulated by translational and possibly posttranslational mechanisms. The differential response in muscle mass between the GAST and TA muscles after training may be due, in part, to greater relative resistances imposed on the TA than on the GAST that result in a more-prolonged effect on protein synthesis rates, with lower numbers of stimulated contractions required to stimulate increases in protein synthesis. Data also revealed that although as little as 1 min of total contractile duration (24 repetitions) increased TA protein synthesis rate by 30%, 8 min of total contractile duration (192 repetitions) further increased TA protein synthesis rates to only 45% above control.\r"

Dynamic elbow flexion training of one arm resulted in a significant 48% mean increase in the maximal load that could be lifted once (1 RM) and a smaller improvement in isokinetic torque (8.8%) but no change in isometric strength. In the contralateral control arm, 1 RM and isokinetic torque increased by 12.7 and 6.5%, respectively, but isometric strength did not change. The interpolated twitch technique confirmed complete motor unit activation during a maximal isometric contraction of the elbow flexors before and after the training. Bilateral leg press training effected mean increases of 17 and 23% in isokinetic torque and dynamic lifting capacity, respectively. The mean maximal cross-sectional area of the elbow flexors (biceps brachii and brachialis) increased by 17.4% in the trained arm but did not change the control arm. The increase in the mean area of type II fibers in the biceps brachii muscle in the trained arm (30.2%) was greater than the corresponding change in the control arm (10.7%, P less than 0.05). The most significant change in the evoked contractile properties of the trained elbow flexors was the increase in twitch half-relaxation time. It is concluded that older individuals retain the potential for significant increases in strength performance and upper limb muscle hypertrophy in response to overload training.\r"

There was a trend for this hyperemic response to be greater as airway diameter decreased from the trachea to 2-mm-diam central airways. In airways smaller than 2 mm, the hyperemic response appeared to diminish. The total systemic blood flow to whole lung is predominantly to small peripheral airways and showed no significant increase from its baseline level of 17.5 +/- 3.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 in the lung homogenate. Occlusion of the bronchoesophageal artery decreased central airway blood flow 60-80% and peripheral airway blood flow 40-60% in both the sham and the smoke groups.\r"

The direct effect of temperature (15-41 degrees C) on rat diaphragm isometric contractility and fatigue was determined in vitro. As temperature decreased from 37 to 15 degrees C, contraction and relaxation times increased, and there was a left shift of the diaphragm's force-frequency curve, with decreased contractility at 41 and 15 degrees C. Fatigue was induced by 10 min of stimulation with 30 trains/min of 5 Hz at a train duration of 900 ms. Compared with 37 degrees C, fatigue resistance was enhanced at 25 degrees C, but no difference in fatigue indexes was evident at extreme hypothermia (15 degrees C) or hyperthermia (41 degrees C). Only when the fatigue program was adjusted to account for hypothermia-induced increases in tension-time indexes was fatigue resistance evident at 15 degrees C. These findings indicate that despite the diaphragm's unique location as a core structure, necessitating exposure to in vivo temperatures higher than found in limb muscle, the temperature dependence of rat diaphragm muscle contractility and fatigue is similar to that reported for limb muscle of mixed fiber type.\r"

With left atrial pressure (Pla) constant at 5 mmHg, flow (Q) was raised in steps over a physiological range. Changes in vascular volume (delta V) with each increment in Q were determined as the opposite of changes in perfusion system reservoir weight or from the increase in lung weight. At each level of Q, the pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannulas were simultaneously occluded, allowing all vascular pressures to equilibrate at the same static pressure (Ps), which was equal to the compliance-weighted average pressure in the circulation before occlusion. Hypoxia (inspired PO2 25 Torr) in ferret lungs, which causes intense constriction in arterial extra-alveolar vessels, had no effect on the slope of the Ps-Q relationship, interpreted to represent the resistance downstream from compliance (control 0.025 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min, hypoxia 0.030 +/- 0.013). The Ps-axis intercept increased from 8.94 +/- 0.50 to 13.43 +/- 1.52 mmHg, indicating a modest increase in the effective back-pressure to flow downstream from compliant regions. The compliance of the circulation, obtained from the slope of the relationship between delta V and Ps, was unaffected by hypoxia (control 0.52 +/- 0.08 ml/mmHg, hypoxia 0.56 +/- 0.08). In contrast, histamine in canine lungs, which causes constriction in veins, caused the slope of the Ps-Q relationship to increase from 0.013 +/- 0.007 to 0.032 +/- 0.006 mmHg.ml-1.min (P less than 0.05) and the compliance to decrease from 3.51 +/- 0.56 to 1.68 +/- 0.37 ml/mmHg (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we measured H2O2 production in six regions of the rat brain before and after convulsions induced by hyperbaric hyperoxia (HBO). H2O2 concentration was determined ex vivo using a method based on the H2O2-dependent decline in catalase activity in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor of compound I, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Regional catalase activity in the brain ranged from 0.029 +/- 0.004 to 0.055 +/- 0.004 mumol O2.min-1.micrograms DNA-1 in cerebellum and medulla-pons, respectively. In the presence of aminotriazole, catalase activity declined after HBO-induced convulsions to 26-45% of normoxic values. The rates of inactivation of catalase were used to predict average steady-state values for H2O2 concentration in different brain structures. Estimated H2O2 concentrations during HBO varied from 31 to 51 pM in cerebellum and posterior subcortex and represented increases of 2.2-7.3 times normoxic values. These findings suggest that H2O2 is an important mediator of selective neuronal vulnerability to CNS O2 toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocytes within the circulation are in dynamic equilibrium with a marginated pool, thought to reside mainly within the pulmonary capillaries. The size discrepancy between the mean diameter of circulating leukocytes (6-8 microns) and that of the pulmonary capillaries (approximately 5.5 microns) forces the cells to deform in order to transit the capillary bed. Consequently, we investigated the hypothesis that the biophysical properties of cell size and deformability determined differential leukocyte retention in the lung. Comparison of the filtration properties of human neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes through polycarbonate filters (5-micron pore diameter) revealed that the largest leukocytes (neutrophils and monocytes) were retained to the greatest extent and the smaller cells (lymphocytes and platelets) the least. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells, of greater diameter than their differentiated counterparts, were also retained to a greater extent, confirming that cell size was one important determinant of retention in these model capillaries. However, compared with neutrophils, which are of similar diameter, monocytes were retained to a greater extent, suggesting that monocytes might be less deformable than neutrophils. To test this hypothesis, deformability was measured directly using the cell poker. Monocytes were found to be the stiffest, neutrophils the softest, and lymphocytes intermediate. Glutaraldehyde treatment of neutrophils markedly increased their stiffness and decreased their ability to transit the pores of the filters in vitro and the pulmonary microvasculature of rabbits without changing their adhesive properties or size. These observations support the hypothesis that biophysical properties of leukocytes (size and deformability) determine in part their ability to transit the pulmonary capillaries and may determine the magnitude of their marginated pools.\r"

Sheep were instrumented for measurements of dynamic compliance (Cdyn), functional residual capacity by body plethysmography (FRC), hemodynamics, and lung lymph flow. Each day Cdyn and FRC were measured before, during, and after the application of 45 min continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 15 cmH2O. The amount of aerosol histamine necessary to reduce Cdyn 35% from baseline (ED35) was measured each day as was the response to aerosol metaproterenol. Cdyn decreased progressively from 0.083 +/- 0.005 (SE) 1/cmH2O at baseline to 0.032 +/- 0.004 l/cm H2O at 96 h of O2. Surprisingly, FRC did not decrease (1,397 +/- 153 ml at baseline vs. 1,523 +/- 139 ml at 96 h). The ED35 to histamine did not vary among days or from air controls. Metaproterenol produced a variable inconsistent increase in Cdyn. We also measured changes in Cdyn during changes in respiratory rate and static pressure-volume relationships in five other sheep. We found a small but significant frequency dependence of compliance and an increase in lung stiffness with O2 toxicity. We conclude that in adult sheep O2 toxicity reduces Cdyn but does not increase airway reactivity. The large reduction in Cdyn in O2 toxicity results from processes other than increased airway reactivity or reduced lung volume, and Cdyn decreases before the development of lung edema.\r"

We observed that brief exposure of artificially bronchoconstricted cats to high concentrations of SO2 induces a bronchodilator response. This study assessed the characteristics of this response and examined various mechanisms that might underlie it. Cats were anesthetized with diallylbarbital-urethan, and airway smooth muscle tone, measured by lung resistance and dynamic lung compliance, was elevated with a continuous infusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine. Administration of 10 breaths of SO2 via a tracheostomy induced concentration-dependent bronchodilation in the range 100-1,000 parts/million. Only infrequently was bronchoconstriction observed before bronchodilation. SO2-induced bronchodilator responses were unaffected by pretreatment with intravenous atropine or propranolol, establishing them as nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) in origin. Neither the ganglionic blocking agent hexamethonium nor the nerve toxin tetrodotoxin influenced the SO2-induced bronchodilation, thus excluding a role for central or local autonomic reflexes in the response. Efforts to modulate the response by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the mediator release inhibitor cromolyn sodium also were unsuccessful. Administration of acidic aerosols failed to mimic the SO2-induced bronchodilator response. Although the mechanism whereby SO2 induces bronchodilation under these experimental conditions remains unclear, release of a NANC inhibitory transmitter from a neural, epithelial, or other cellular source via a mechanism insensitive to both tetrodotoxin and cromolyn is a distinct possibility. An intrinsic NANC inhibitory system may exist in feline airways functioning as a local regulator of bronchomotor tone and possibly serving to override responses to strong, potentially asphyxial bronchoconstrictive stimuli.\r"

Peak cardiac output, estimated by extrapolation from a series of submaximal measurements by the CO2 rebreathing method, increased by 30% (from 12.7 to 16.5 l/min) in the old subjects, associated with a 6% increase (from 126 to 135 ml/l) in arteriovenous O2 difference; in the young subjects there were equal 14% increases in both variables (18.0 to 20.5 l/min and 140 to 159 ml/l, respectively). Submaximal mean arterial pressure and cardiac output were lower posttraining in the old subjects; total vascular conductance and cardiac stroke volume increased. Although peak power at the start of a short-term maximal isokinetic test did not change, total work accomplished in 30 s at a pedaling frequency of 110 revolutions/min increased in both groups, from 11.2 to 12.6 kJ and from 15.7 to 16.9 kJ in the old and young, respectively; fatigue during the 30-s test was less, and postexercise plasma lactate concentrations were lower. In older subjects, increases in aerobic power after high-intensity endurance training are at least as large as in younger subjects and are associated with increases in vascular conductance, maximal cardiac output, and stroke volume.\r"

Maximal oxygen uptake expressed as milliliters per kilogram per minute improved 25% in men and 21% in women (P less than 0.01). Maximal leg blood flow and conductance increased in all nine men by an average of 39 +/- 33 (P less than 0.001) and 42 +/- 44% (P less than 0.004), respectively. Results were more variable in women and achieved unequivocal statistical significance only for maximal blood flow (+33 +/- 54% for blood flow and +29 +/- 55% for conductance; P less than 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). Body weight and skinfold adiposity declined in both sexes (P less than 0.05). Enhancement of vasodilatory capacity was related to weight loss in men and adipose tissue loss in women (r = 0.61 and 0.51, respectively; P less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in exercise capacity, body weight, or maximal blood flow in four male and three female controls aged 66 +/- 4 yr. Thus adaptability of the lower limb circulation to endurance exercise training is retained to at least age 65 yr.\r"

Voluntary contractions at 20% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and at 80% MVC with duration of 20 s were performed at the beginning of each experiment. Tetanic electrical stimulation was then applied to the main muscle motor point for 20 s with surface electrodes at five stimulation frequencies (20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Hz). All subjects showed myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue consisting of negative trends of spectral variables and conduction velocity and positive trends of amplitude variables. The main findings of this work are 1) myoelectric signal variables obtained from electrically elicited contractions show fluctuations smaller than those observed in voluntary contractions, 2) spectral variables are more sensitive to fatigue than conduction velocity and the average rectified value is more sensitive to fatigue than the root-mean-square value, 3) conduction velocity is not the only physiological factor affecting spectral variables, and 4) contractions elicited at supramaximal stimulation and frequencies greater than 30 Hz demonstrate myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue greater than those observed at 80% MVC sustained for the same time.\r"

During pulmonary hypertension induced by U-46619, ATP-MgCl2 (0.01-1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.4-40.7%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at the highest doses (P less than 0.05). Left atrial infusions of ATP-MgCl2 caused systemic hypotension without decreasing pulmonary arterial pressure. During hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, ATP-MgCl2 caused a similar significant dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (12.0-41.1%, P less than 0.05), while systemic arterial pressure decreased only at high doses (P less than 0.05). Regression analysis showed selectivity of the vasodilating effects of ATP-MgCl2 for the pulmonary circulation during pulmonary hypertension induced either by U-46619 or hypoxia. ATP-MgCl2 is a potent vasodilator with a rapid metabolism that allows for selective vasodilation of the vascular bed first encountered (pulmonary or systemic). We conclude that infusions of ATP-MgCl2 may be clinically useful in the treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

One candidate for augmenting epithelial anti-NE protection is the secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 96 +/- 1% of the recombinant SLPI (rSLPI) molecules were capable of inhibiting NE, with an association rate constant of 7.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(6) M-1.s-1. Evaluation of rSLPI after in vitro and in vivo aerosolization showed that aerosolization did not alter rSLPI. Aerosolization of a single dose of 50 mg rSLPI to sheep resulted in a fourfold increase of the anti-NE capacity in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) at 3 h, with a half-life in ELF of 12 h. After aerosolization some rSLPI appeared in lung lymph. Simultaneous aerosolization of rSLPI and recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) demonstrated a molar ratio of the concentration in lymph to the concentration in ELF 3 h after the aerosol eightfold higher for rAAT than for rSLPI. Overall, these observations demonstrate that it is feasible to use aerosolized rSLPI to directly augment the anti-NE capacity of the lung, particularly on the pulmonary epithelial surface.\r"

Fasting produced significant elevations in the resting concentrations of blood free fatty acids (FFA; 1.16 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.06 mM, F vs. PA, respectively, a 107% increase), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH, 2.06 +/- 0.66 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 mM, a 1,270% increase), and glycerol (0.12 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 mM, a 200% increase), with a significant decline in glucose (79.79 +/- 2.12 vs. 98.88 +/- 3.11 mg/dl, a 19% decrease). Exercise in the F trial increased FFA, decreased glucose, and significantly elevated beta-OH and glycerol over the PA trial. There was no difference in blood glucose concentration between trials at exhaustion. However, F produced a significant decrement in exercise endurance time compared with the PA trial (88.9 +/- 18.3 vs. 144.4 +/- 22.6 min, F vs. PA, a 38% decrease). Based on the respiratory exchange ratio, fasting led to a greater utilization of lipids during rest and exercise. It was concluded that 1) a 36-h fast significantly altered substrate utilization at rest and throughout exercise to exhaustion, 2) glucose levels do not appear to be the single determinant of time to exhaustion in submaximal exercise, and 3) despite the apparent sparing of carbohydrate utilization with the 36-h fast, endurance performance was significantly decreased.\r"

[14C]DPC ether, made into liposomes with [3H]DPC and associated with 32P-labeled rabbit surfactant, was given intratracheally to 1-kg rabbits, which were killed at preset times to 48 h. Recoveries of radiolabel as saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) isolated from alveolar wash (AW), postlavage lung homogenate (LH), and alveolar macrophages were measured. All groups had similar AW and LH Sat PC pool sizes, indicating no perturbation of endogenous Sat PC pools. Despite a nearly fivefold accumulation of [14C]DPC ether in the lung by 48 h (P less than 0.01), the three probes had similar alveolar clearance curves. Furthermore, the Sat PC reutilization efficiency (41.6%) and turnover time (5.9 h) calculated for DPC ether were not different from values for the DPC and rabbit surfactant. Of the DPC ether (0.7%) and DPC (9%) labels recovered as PC in organs outside the lung, greater than 85% was unsaturated, indicating de novo synthesis using precursors from degraded PC. DPC ether was a useful probe of intrapulmonary DPC catabolism, and after alveolar uptake there was no direct reentry of intact DPC from the catabolic compartment(s) into the secretory pathway.\r"

Previous studies suggest that pulmonary gas exchange could influence the rate of fall of arterial oxygen saturation (dSaO2/dt) in obstructive sleep apnea. We postulated that abnormal gas exchange in the form of atelectasis would steepen dSaO2/dt and thereby lower nadir arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) for the same duration of apnea. Apneas were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end expiration in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Apneas of the same duration were then repeated during temporary endobronchial occlusion of one lobe of the lung. SaO2 and mixed venous O2 saturation were continuously monitored, and cardiac output was calculated. Worsening of pulmonary gas exchange during atelectasis was documented by an increase in calculated venous admixture from 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 25.0 +/- 0.7% (P less than 0.001). The dSaO2/dt was independent of apnea duration at 30, 45, and 60 s. During endobronchial occlusion, apnea dSaO2/dt increased 20%, and nadir SaO2 was significantly lower. Possible mechanisms for steepening of dSaO2/dt during atelectasis are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To confirm the regional differences in vascular pressure vs. flow properties of lung regions that have been documented in zone 2 conditions [pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) less than alveolar pressure], regional distending pressure vs. flow curves in zone 3 were generated by use of isolated blood-perfused dog lungs (3 right and 5 left lungs). Each lung was kept inflated at constant inflation pressure (approximately 50% of full inflation volume) while radioactively labeled microspheres were injected at different settings of Ppv. To achieve maximal vascular distension, Ppv was increased to approximately 30 cmH2O above alveolar pressure for the first injection. Subsequent injections were made at successively lower Ppv's. The difference between pulmonary arterial pressure and Ppv was kept constant for all injections. As was found in zone 2 conditions, there were differences in the regional distending pressure vs. flow curves among lung regions. To document the regional variability in the curves, the distribution of flow at a regional Ppv of 30 cmH2O above alveolar pressure was analyzed. There was a statistically significant linear gradient in this flow distribution from dorsal to ventral regions of the lungs but no consistent gradient in the caudad to cephalad direction. These results indicate that, even in near-maximally distended vessels, the dorsal regions of isolated perfused dog lungs have lower intrinsic vascular resistance compared with ventral regions.\r"

Six normal humans performed endurance tests using an isoflow method, which allowed for measurements of maximum dynamic Pmus and Pdi, with controlled lung inflation. The subjects repeated maximum dynamic voluntary inspirations for 10 min. Pressures dropped exponentially from initial measurements at rest (Pmusi or Pdi) to sustainable values (Pmus or Pdis). As flow and tidal volume increased, maximum initial and sustainable pressures decreased significantly. However, at a constant duty cycle, the sustainable dynamic pressures remained predictable fractions of initial dynamic pressures (i.e., Pmuss/Pmusi or Pdis/Pdii), regardless of changes in flow and tidal volume. In contrast, as duty cycle increased, the sustainable fractions significantly decreased for both Pdi and Pmus. For example, at a duty cycle of 0.29, Pmuss/Pmusi was approximately 0.71, and at a duty cycle of 0.57, Pmuss/Pmusi was approximately 0.62. Calculated sustainable pressure-time indexes varied significantly between 0.16 to 0.32 for Pmus and 0.11 to 0.22 for Pdi over the breathing patterns studied. We conclude that 1) the maximum dynamic pressure that can be sustained at a given duty cycle is a predictable fraction of the maximum dynamic pressure that can be generated at rest when measured under the same conditions of inspiration and 2) the sustainable fraction of initial dynamic pressure significantly decreases with increasing duty cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidant-induced injury of the pulmonary microvasculature reportedly contributes to an increase in microvascular permeability and pulmonary hypertension, both of which are principal features of acute lung injury (ALI). We tested the hypothesis that antioxidant therapy with 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), initiated in awake sheep after the development of sepsis-induced ALI, would ameliorate the progression of these lesions. DHB has many actions that suggested to us the potential for demonstrating benefit in ALI complicating sepsis; it is a nontoxic hydroxyl-radical scavenger that also inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and acts as a weak iron chelator. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that pretreatment with DHB prevented an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, plasma thromboxane A2, measured as its metabolite thromboxane B2, and lymph total protein clearance that otherwise followed an infusion of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) in sheep. In subsequent experiments, 12 additional sheep were rendered septic by cecal ligation and perforation. Twenty-four to 36 h after cecal ligation and perforation, an increase in lung microvascular permeability was confirmed, because pulmonary lymph flow had increased by 82% while the mean lymph-to-plasma total protein ratio was unchanged from baseline. At this point, six sheep were then treated with parenteral DHB and six with DHB vehicle for the subsequent 24 h. In contrast to the demonstrated benefit of DHB pretreatment in preventing ALI secondary to an infusion of ZAP, the progressive increase in lymph total protein clearance that complicated septic lung injury in the DHB vehicle group throughout this 24-h study period was not ameliorated in the DHB treatment group. However, DHB did prevent a modest increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressures that was demonstrated in the DHB vehicle group throughout this 24-h treatment period. Although pretreatment prevented ALI after a ZAP infusion, we conclude that DHB only incompletely modified disease progression when administered after the onset of sepsis-induced ALI because it ameliorated the pulmonary hypertensive response without concurrently modifying an increase in lung microvascular fluid flux.\r"

Exercise resulted in 1) decreases in the absolute number of mononuclear spleen cells in T-10 rats, 2) significant increases in in vitro splenic T-cell blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin in T-10 rats, and 3) significant decreases in T-cell blastogenesis in T-15-6 rats. T-15-6 rats were given aminoglutethimide per os before exercise sessions to study the role of corticosteroids in the alteration of splenic T-cell blastogenesis. Aminoglutethimide significantly increased the T-cell blastogenesis in these T-15-6 rats compared with those not given aminoglutethimide, whereas it had no effect on immune parameters of sedentary rats. These results show that immunomodulations in the rat depend on the treadmill exercise regimen employed. If the mechanisms of the immunomodulation induced by isolated exercise of long duration are not elucidated, these data suggest that corticosteroids are involved in the alteration in T-cell blastogenesis induced by chronic muscular exercise.\r"

Uncommon but not rare, toxic epidermal necrolysis occurs in 60 to 70 persons per year in France. It remains as puzzling a disorder as it was 34 years ago, when described by Lyell. Whether or not toxic epidermal necrolysis is the most severe form of erythema multiforme is still the subject of discussion. The physiopathologic events that lead to this rapidly extensive necrosis of the epidermis are not understood. Indirect evidence suggests a hypersensitivity reaction, but the search for potential immunologic mechanisms has resulted in little data to support this hypothesis. Accumulated clinical evidence points to drugs as the most important, if not the only, cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Sulfonamides, especially long-acting forms, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and certain antibiotics are associated with most cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Many other drugs have been implicated in isolated case reports. All organs may be involved either by the same process of destruction of the epithelium as observed in the epidermis or by the same systemic consequences of \"acute skin failure\" as seen in patients with widespread burns. Sepsis is the most important complication and cause of death. Approximately 20% to 30% of all patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis die. Elderly patients and patients with extensive lesions have a higher mortality rate. Surviving patients completely heal in 3 to 4 weeks, but up to 50% will have residual, potentially disabling ocular lesions. The prognosis is improved by adequate therapy, as provided in burn units, that is, aggressive fluid replacement, nutritional support, and a coherent antibacterial policy. Corticosteroids, advocated by some in high doses to halt the \"hypersensitivity\" process, have been shown in several studies to be detrimental and should be avoided.\r"

Because epidermal growth factor receptor localization may change in hyperproliferative skin diseases, we compared epidermal growth factor receptor immunolocalization in seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from women who were or were not pregnant or taking oral sex steroid hormones. Epidermal growth factor receptor was further investigated in growing and quiescent seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from women with and without the dysplastic nevus syndrome. The epidermal growth factor receptor concentration was strikingly elevated in suprabasilar keratinocytes of growing seborrheic keratoses and acrochordons from patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome who were pregnant or taking sex steroid hormones and less elevated in growing seborrheic keratoses from other patients. In contrast, the epidermal growth factor receptor distribution pattern in acrochordons did not correlate as well with the history of growth of these lesions in normal patients. These data suggest sex steroids may affect epidermal growth factor receptor metabolism in benign epidermal hyperproliferative lesions, particularly in patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome.\r"

To assess the accuracy of GB3 in the diagnosis of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, we have reviewed its use in 250 cases of the major types of epidermolysis bullosa. In the majority of cases of the simplex and dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, GB3 antigen is normally expressed. In the Herlitz variant of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, GB3 antigen expression is consistently abnormal, but in the non-Herlitz and indeterminate forms of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, 40% of cases express GB3 antigen normally. We propose that GB3 monoclonal antibody is useful in the accurate identification of patients with Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa and may prove equal to electron microscopy for the diagnosis of this disease. For the non-Herlitz variants, it should not be used as an alternative to electron microscopy but may be of special value in the determination of prognosis.\r"

Ninety-five percent believed that the sun can cause skin cancer, although only half of the subset who lived all year in Puerto Rico believed that they personally received enough exposure to be at risk. The majority of the group (83%) understood the meaning of the sun protection factor numbers, although 35% used either nothing or a nonscreening oil. Half of Puerto Rican residents rarely or never used sunscreen protection while sunbathing. When sunscreen was used, the most important factor sought was given as sun protection factor (64%), followed by a perceived ability to aid in tanning (26%).\r"

Signs of tuberous sclerosis or renal angiomyolipoma were absent in all cases. Histologically, the tumors were subcutaneous, well circumscribed, and composed of smooth muscle, vascular spaces, connective tissue, and mature fat. In some tumors the fat was the predominant component, and in others smooth muscle predominated. Elastic tissue stains revealed that some blood vessels had developed an elastic lamina whereas other blood vessels lacked it. Additional histologic features occasionally observed included vascular thrombi, glomus bodies, and focal mucin deposition.\r"

In the group with atypical nevi, a person with two or more clinically atypical nevi was 16 times more likely to have histologic confirmation than a person with a single clinically atypical nevus (p = 0.003). Eighty persons were screened by both a dermatologist and a dermatology nurse; the crude agreement rate for actinic keratoses was 0.62; for atypical nevi, 0.53; and for BCC, 0.88. Both nurses and physicians overdiagnosed in the screening setting, the nurses more so than the physicians.

In addition, a strong negative correlation was found between free fatty acid and triglyceride levels.

A mixed pattern (two or more major histologic patterns) was present in 401 cases (38.5%). Our study indicates that nodular and superficial basal cell carcinomas can be completely removed by simple surgical excision in a high percentage of cases (93.6% and 96.4%, respectively) whereas the micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheic basal cell carcinomas have a higher incidence of positive tumor margins (18.6%, 26.5%, and 33.3%, respectively) after excision. Mixed patterns that consisted of combinations of the nodular, micronodular, or infiltrative types exhibited a behavior similar to the pattern that resulted in a greater chance of incomplete surgical removal.\r"

Cultures were taken before antiseptic application, 30 seconds after application, and before closure. Each group showed a statistically significant reduction in aerobic bacteria both 30 seconds after antiseptic application and before closure. All aerobic bacterial counts at both intervals were less than 100,000 colony-forming units/cm2 in each group.

  ".W": "Macrophage CSF (M-CSF, CSF-1) and IL-4 are two cytokines known to have effects on mature monocytic phagocytes in vitro. In this report we show that M-CSF and IL-4 activate resident mouse peritoneal macrophages to ingest particles via their C3b and C3bi receptors, which are not capable of mediating ingestion in resting cells. IgG-mediated ingestion was also increased by IL-4 and M-CSF. IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were not able to stimulate C receptor-mediated ingestion. Stimulation by IL-4 and M-CSF is dependent upon high cell density and greater than 24-h exposure to the cytokine. Interestingly, antibody to IFN-alpha/beta and mAb to IFN-beta inhibited the enhanced ingestion caused by both M-CSF and IL-4. However, neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-beta alone stimulated C receptor-mediated ingestion. M-CSF did not affect the ligand-independent distribution of CR3 on the macrophage surface. We conclude that two apparently unrelated cytokines, M-CSF and IL-4, both enhance macrophage phagocytosis of C and IgG-coated targets via a common pathway in which autocrine stimulation with IFN-alpha/beta is necessary but not sufficient.\r"

Both proteins are involved in the host inflammatory response, and LF has been found to have myelosuppressive activity in vivo and in vitro. Little is known, however, about the regulation of their production. We investigated the stability of LF and MPO mRNA and the effects of purified recombinant human TNF-alpha on LF and MPO levels in normal human bone marrow. Low density human bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (10 micrograms/ml) or TNF-alpha (200 U/ml). LF and MPO RNA levels were analyzed by Northern blots using, respectively, a 650-bp insert from the plasmid pHL41, and a 2.3-kb insert from the plasmid pMPO2 as probes. It was found that: 1) LF mRNA is a fairly stable molecule, with a half-life of between 8 and 9 h, whereas MPO is less stable, with a half-life of between 4 and 5 h; 2) TNF-alpha decreases both LF and MPO mRNA levels, an effect seen by 24 h with MPO mRNA and 48 h with LF mRNA; 3) nuclear run-on assays revealed that TNF decreases transcription of the LF gene by 70% and the MPO gene by 50%; and 4) the suppressive effect of TNF-alpha on LF and MPO mRNA levels is not due to cell killing or selective differentiation and is reversible.\r"

  ".W": "One of the primary strategies for malaria vaccine development has been to design subunit vaccines that induce protective levels of antibodies against the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of malaria sporozoites. In the Plasmodium yoelii mouse model system such vaccines have been uniformly unsuccessful in protecting against sporozoite-induced malaria. To demonstrate that antibodies to P. yoelii CS protein could provide protection we established a passive transfer model. Passive transfer of Navy yoelii sporozoite 1 (NYS1), an IgG3 mAb against the P. yoelii CS protein, protected 100% of mice against challenge with 5000 P. yoelii sporozoites. Binding of NYS1 to sporozoites was inhibited by incubation with (QGPGAP)2, a synthetic peptide derived from the repeat region of the P. yoelii CS protein, indicating that the epitope on sporozoites recognized by this mAb was included within this peptide. The levels of antibodies to (QGPGAP)2 by ELISA, and to sporozoites by indirect fluorescent antibody test and CS precipitation reaction were similar in sera from mice that received NYS1 in passive transfer and were protected against challenge with 5000 sporozoites, and from mice that had been immunized with subunit vaccines containing (QGPGAP)2 but were not protected against challenge with 40-200 sporozoites. To determine if antibody avidity, not absolute concentration could explain the striking differences in protection, we established a thiocyanate elution assay. The results suggest that NYS1, the protective mAb, has a lower avidity for (QGPGAP)2 and for sporozoites than do the vaccine-induced antibodies. Although the results of the conventional antibody assays did not correlate with protection, sera from the protected animals inhibited sporozoite development in mouse hepatocyte cultures significantly more than did the sera from the unprotected, subunit vaccine-immunized animals, correlating with protection. The data clearly demonstrate that antibodies to the CS protein can protect against intense sporozoite infection. Improved understanding of the differences between protective mAb and nonprotective polyclonal antibodies will be important in the further development of malaria vaccines.\r"

In the case of HIV-1 infection, it is unknown whether the tat-I gene, an essential gene for viral replication, affects host cell nuclear factors. Using two-dimensional PAGE, we have identified a novel nuclear protein, designated nuclear protein-28,000 (NP-28), which is induced in Jurkat T cells by stimulation with PMA and/or PHA or ionomycin. This nuclear protein has an apparent molecular mass of 28,000 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.6. Interestingly, Jurkat cells transfected with tat-I express higher levels of NP-28 constitutively, without added stimulation. Incubation of Jurkat cells expressing tat-I with PMA and/or PHA or ionomycin causes superinduction of NP-28. We have therefore identified a novel lymphoid nuclear protein induced by T cell activation that occurs in tat-I expressing cells in the absence of activating agents.\r"

Based upon sequence relationships and hybridization analyses, five different groups of VH genes are identified whose definition is consistent with that of five different VH families. Genomic Southern blots indicate that as many as 100 different germ-line VH genes are likely represented by these families. The sequence diversity between identified members of these different families is similar in magnitude to the divergence represented between members of different human or mouse VH families. The FR regions are the most conserved regions when members of different catfish VH families are compared; specific amino acid positions appear to be highly conserved in phylogeny. Equally important is that diversity is represented in complementarity-determining regions CDR1 and CDR2 in members of the different families as well as in members of the same VH family. These results suggest that an extensive repertoire of VH genes can contribute to antibody diversity in this lower vertebrate. Sequence comparisons indicate that one of the catfish VH families shares considerable structural similarity to several higher vertebrate VH gene families--a relationship which suggests that this VH family may be ancestral to some VH gene families of higher vertebrates. Characteristic of the genomic organization of higher vertebrate H chains, catfish appear to have different VH families wherein a VH gene likely undergoes functional recombination with putative DH gene segments and one of apparently several different JH segments. The recombined V region is expressed with the same C region gene. These combined results suggest that bony fishes are the earliest known phylogenetic representatives to have evolved extensive V region gene families.\r"

By using our optimal electroporation conditions on activated primary B cells, more than 30% of the resulting viable cells expressed CD2 on the cell surface. Moreover, unactivated primary B cells could also be transfected using this system but subsequent expression of CD2 required cellular activation. Magnetic beads or plastic culture bottles coated with anti-CD2 antibodies have been used to selectively purify transfected cells. The high transfection efficiency combined with the ability to specifically purify transfected cells may allow future studies on specific genes transiently expressed in human primary B cells.\r"

Studies by others have shown that the structural gene for this protein appears intact in deficient individuals. We studied affected individuals from 10 unrelated families to determine the basis for their defect. Using chain-specific antisera, C8 beta was undetectable on immunoblots of their sera. The polymerase chain reaction was used to probe cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from human liver cells, HepG2 cells, peripheral blood monocytes, and fibroblasts to identify a readily available cell source expressing C8 beta message. Cells from each of these sources expressed C8 beta message. The identity of the amplified product was confirmed and this approach was used to probe cDNA synthesized from RNA harvested from monocytes or fibroblasts obtained from two unrelated families with C8 beta deficiency. C8 beta mRNA was readily detectable in C8 beta sufficient and heterozygous family members but required Southern blotting and hybridization to the 32P-labeled C8 beta probe for detection in the homozygous deficient probands. These results suggest that C8 beta-deficient individuals produce less C8 beta-specific mRNA than do normals and that the underlying basis for this deficiency is an abnormality in intracellular events that precede secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The human complement component C4A and C4B genes are located within the class III region of the MHC. The polymorphic C4 genes are highly complex including variations in class (isotype), size, and number of genes. The DNA sequence for a C4A gene has been determined, except for a large intron of 6 to 7 kb long. The C4A gene consists of 41 exons encoding a transcript for a precursor protein of 1744 amino acid residues. Several structural and functional aspects of C4 have been located to individual exons. The active site of the anaphylatoxin C4a matches to a splice junction. Some unique properties of C4, such as, the alpha-gamma-chain junction, the tyrosine sulfation sites, and the post-secretory metalloprotease cleavage site, are encoded by a single exon. Comparison of human C4 with published data for mouse C4, human C3 and rat alpha 2 macroglobulin genes revealed that these evolutionary-related genes share very similar exon-intron structures. Altogether 20 polymorphic sites in human C4 have been detected by various techniques. Presumably, these polymorphic residues account for the functional, structural, and serologic variations observed among the various allotypes. A PvuII restriction length polymorphism has been detected within the region of DNA coding for C4a. The intergenic region between C4 and the neighboring 21-hydroxylase gene, CYP21, is approximately 3028 bp in size.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B cell type (B-CLL) is a neoplastic disorder characterized by the accumulation of small resting lymphocytes in the periphery. The phenotype of these cells suggests that they are \"frozen\" at an early stage of maturation. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to treat patients with B-CLL, resulting in a reduction in the peripheral lymphocyte count by an undefined mechanism. Here we report that glucocorticoids stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of a suicide process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) in suspensions of cells from patients with B-CLL. The effects can be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophore and involve a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Specific antibodies binding to membrane-associated IgM on the leukemic cells can also induce PCD by a similar mechanism. Phorbol esters block DNA fragmentation and cell killing in response to all of the agents, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C desensitizes the cells to PCD. Targeting the B-CLL cells with antibodies that induce an unbalanced, sustained Ca2+ increase may therefore represent a rational strategy for the destruction of leukemic cells.\r"

Cell-free ascitic fluid and culture supernatant (SN) were obtained from the ascites and cultures allowing MH134 hepatoma cells to grow. These ascites and SN samples were tested for their abilities to influence the generation of CTL responses to TNP and alloantigens. The generation of the anti-TNP CTL responses that require self H-2-restricted CD4+ Th cells was markedly suppressed by addition of the ascites or SN under conditions in which these samples did not inhibit anti-allo CTL responses capable of using alternate pathways of allo-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ Th. The activation of CD8+ CTL precursors and CTL activity were also resistant to the ascites or SN. The ascites- or SN-induced suppressive effect to which CD4+ Th were most susceptible was found to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity, because: 1) the TGF-beta activity was detected in the MH134 ascites and culture SN; 2) the suppression of CD4+ Th function required for anti-TNP CTL responses was almost completely prevented by addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody to cultures and; 3) rTGF-beta also induced similar patterns of immunosuppression to those observed by ascites or SN. These results indicate that TGF-beta produced by tumor cells induces deleterious effects on T cell, especially on the CD4+ Th subset, and provide an explanation for the molecular mechanism underlying the previously observed CD4+ Th-selective suppression in the tumor-bearing state.\r"

  ".W": "A number of integral membrane proteins (Imps) isolated from Escherichia coli have been examined for their ability to generate serum antibody responses in the absence of adjuvant. These proteins were found to stimulate high titers of serum antibody when injected into rabbits or mice in saline. The antibody titers elicited were not significantly increased by the addition of a powerful adjuvant such as IFA. Covalent conjugation of BSA, of the DNP group, and of a peptide Ag from Plasmodium falciparum to these protein carriers resulted in a significant enhancement of the immune response to the conjugated material in comparison with the response elicited when the immunogen was injected without adjuvant or was not conjugated to Imps. The antibody response to these conjugates could not be significantly increased by the addition of IFA. Thus, the Imps of E. coli represent powerful carrier molecules which, when injected into mice and rabbits, are not only capable of generating high titers of antibody to themselves, but also to molecules conjugated to them. Immunization with immunogens coupled to these proteins results in the production of high titers of antibody without the need for oil-based adjuvants, thereby avoiding the unwanted side effects of such adjuvants.\r"

  ".W": "When activated with either Con A, a CD3-specific mAb, or Ag-pulsed B lymphoma (LK35.2) cells, CD4 (Th1) clones quickly induce DNA fragmentation in target cells followed by release of 51Cr-labeled intracellular materials. Both activated CD4 clones and CD8 (CTL) cells fragment target DNA into electrophoretically identical \"ladder\" pattern made of approximately 200 bp. The effect of various metabolic inhibitors on the ability of CD4 and CD8 cells to induce target DNA fragmentation was studied. Little effect was observed with the DNA synthesis inhibitor, mitomycin C. The RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, and the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, strongly inhibited the ability of CD4 cells, but not CD8 cells, to induce target DNA fragmentation. In contrast, target DNA fragmentation by CD8 cells, but not by CD4 cells, was inhibited by cholera toxin. Although cyclosporin A inhibited CD4 cells to fragment target DNA during the early phase (90 min) of E:T interaction, this inhibition was not sustained in the later phase (210 min) of the assay. Zinc ions inhibited the ability of both CD4 and CD8 cells to fragment target DNA. Treatment of effectors and targets with these inhibitors, followed by washings, demonstrated that the action of these inhibitors on effector cells alone is sufficient to inhibit target DNA fragmentation. The strong correlation among these parameters of DNA fragmentation and Cr-release assays supports the hypothesis of programed cell death. Although distinct cytolytic pathways are used by CD4 and CD8 cells to kill targets, both pathways deliver a signal that activates endonuclease(s), fragments target DNA, causes Cr-release, and lyses target cells. Taken together with our previous studies, the present findings demonstrate that activated cytolytic CD4 clones do not use perforin, serine proteases, and TNF as mediators for resistant target DNA fragmentation.\r"

  ".W": "An EBNA- human B lymphoma cell line, B104, was established. B104 cells express IgD as well as IgM on their surface, which is thought to be a basic characteristic of mature B cells. The growth of B104 cells was inhibited by treatment with a panel of anti-IgM antibodies. Cell cycle analyses revealed that the transition of B104 cells from the G2/M to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle was markedly inhibited by treatment with anti-IgM antibodies. Progression of B104 cells to the M phase of the cell cycle was found to be suppressed in the presence of anti-IgM antibodies. In contrast, both the entrance of G0/G1 phase cells into the S phase and the progression of S phase cells to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle did not seem to be inhibited significantly by treatment with anti-IgM antibodies. These results indicate that the mechanism of the inhibition of growth of B104 cells by anti-IgM antibodies is blockage of the transition from the G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast to anti-IgM antibodies, anti-IgD antibodies could not cause growth inhibition of B104 cells at all. B cell growth factors such as IL-4 and IL-6 had no effect on the inhibition of growth of B104 cells by anti-IgM antibody. IFN-alpha and -beta, which have no B cell growth factor activity, did increase the number of cells that survived the treatment with anti-IgM antibodies. B104 is an excellent experimental model for the study of the mechanism of signal transduction through sIg as well as the functional difference between sIgM and sIgD.\r"

  ".W": "Staphylococcus enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 are members of a family of exoproteins that are produced by staphylococci and bind specifically to MHC class II molecules. Upon binding to MHC class II molecules, these exoproteins are potent stimulators of T cell proliferation via interaction with specific TCR V-beta segments of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These exoproteins also directly stimulate monocytes to secrete IL-1 and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these exoproteins have a profound inhibitory effect on Ig production by PBMC. We examined the effects of Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) on proliferation and Ig production of highly purified human B cells. Our results demonstrated that the binding of SEA to MHC class II molecules on B cells does not alter their ability to proliferate in response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC) or to produce Ig in response to SAC plus rIL-2. In contrast, the anti-DR mAb L243 inhibited both B cell proliferation and Ig production. Unable to determine a direct effect of SEA on B cell function, we investigated whether the capacity of SEA to inhibit SAC-induced Ig production by PBMC was T cell-dependent. Our results demonstrated that in the presence of T cells, under appropriate conditions, SEA can either function as a nominal Ag for stimulation of B cell proliferation and Ig production or induce T cell-mediated suppression of Ig production. SEA-induced Ig production required T cell help, which was dependent on pretreatment of the T cells with irradiation or mitomycin C; Ig production was not induced by SEA in the absence of T cells or in the presence of untreated T cells. Furthermore, SEA inhibited Ig production in SAC-stimulated cultures of autologous B cells and untreated T cells; pretreatment of the T cells with irradiation or mitomycin C abrogated SEA-induced inhibition of Ig production. Thus, T cell suppression of SAC-induced Ig production was dependent on T cell proliferation. Similar results were observed with both SEA and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1.\r"

We now show that anti-delta-dex may provide a suitable model to study Ig secretion stimulated by soluble T cell-independent type 2 Ag exemplified by TNP-Ficoll. Thus, both TNP-Ficoll and anti-delta-dex stimulate low to undetectable levels of Ig secretion when cultured with resting B cells. Addition of IL-5 or IL-2 stimulated enhanced anti-TNP responses in the presence of TNP-Ficoll, or induced polyclonal Ig secretion in the presence of anti-delta-dex. Both TNP-Ficoll and anti-delta-dex conjugates stimulated Ig production by Percoll-separated low density (partially activated) B cells in the absence of added lymphokines. These findings point to the similarities in the activation requirements of TNP-Ficoll and anti-delta-dex and suggest that dextran-anti-Ig conjugates, which can induce B cell activation irrespective of Ag specificity, may provide a useful model for studying various parameters that characterize the responses to soluble TI type 2 Ag.\r"

We have previously established CD4+ autoreactive cloned T cells with a special tropism for epidermis in vitro as well as in vivo. Antibody inhibition studies demonstrated that only anti-lymphocyte function associated Ag 1 (anti-LFA-1) mAb completely inhibited the in vitro migration of the T cells toward the epidermis, whereas mAb against other T cell surface molecules had little or no effect. Monovalent F(ab) fragment of the anti-LFA-1 mAb, although less efficient, also inhibited the T cell migration. The apparent dependency of the inhibition on the anti-alpha-chain mAb suggested a major role for the alpha-chain of LFA-1 in T cell migration to epidermis. The relevance of an LFA-1-dependent mechanism to the epidermotropic migration of T cells was further strengthened by the findings that the T cell migration to epidermis was inhibited by divalent cation depletion, cytochalasin B, and low temperature. These findings indicate that the LFA-1 molecule, which is thought to be primarily involved in cell-to-cell adhesions, also plays an important role in directing T cell migration to epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies to surface Ig or to the B cell marker CD20 trigger resting human B cells in similar yet distinct ways. Either antibody induces five-fold increases in the expression of the protooncogene, c-myc, as detected with semi-quantitative Northern blot assays. The induction of c-myc mRNA by anti-IgM or anti-CD20 is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) such as staurosporine and by pretreatment of B cells with phorbol esters to reduce cellular PKC levels. This suggests that PKC is involved in the pathways stimulated by both anti-IgM and anti-CD20. However, anti-CD20, unlike anti-IgM, does not activate significant increases in inositol triphosphate or intracellular-free calcium. Further, anti-CD20-triggered elevation of c-myc mRNA is inhibited by pertussis and cholera toxins, whereas the pathway initiated by anti-IgM if anything is stimulated by pertussis toxin and unchanged by cholera toxin. Further differences in the nature of these two signals were seen when the expression of adhesion/recognition molecules were examined. Anti-IgM consistently induces increased expression of the adhesion molecules CD54 (I-CAM-1) and B7/BB-1 on B cells, but anti-CD20 does not. Yet both anti-CD20 and anti-IgM increase class II MHC, CD18 (LFA-1 beta-chain) and LFA-3 levels. These data suggest that the way in which B cells are activated may influence their surface phenotype and possibly subsequent migration or cell-cell interactions.\r"

The mechanism of HR seems to be a multistep process. According to a model we proposed earlier, a T cell recognizes the Hh-1 Ag and stimulates a macrophage to secrete IFN-alpha/beta (recognition phase). IFN-alpha/beta activates a NK-like cell that specifically kills the parental bmc (effector phase). We have also described in a previous paper that serum from resistant F1 hybrids contains a humoral factor that seems to be involved in the effector phase of HR. In the present work, we study the role and the nature of this humoral factor. Our results show that this humoral factor: 1) is present in all resistant H-2Db heterozygous F1 hybrids we have tested but not in nonresistant H-2Db homozygous mice; 2) seems to recognize the Hh-1b Ag because it is absorbed on bmc from Hh-1b mice but not on bmc from Hh-1d and Hh-1- mice; and 3) is an IgG1 Ig (natural antibody). These results could help us to explain the specificity of HR at the effector phase by supposing that this natural antibody recognize the Hh-1 Ag and enable NK-like cells to kill parental bmc cells in Hh-1 specific manner.\r"

Thirty to 40% of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes expressed CR2 Ag. The cells expressed three nonoverlapping epitopes of CR2. The specificity of the staining for CR2 epitopes was demonstrated by the ability of unlabeled anti-CR2 mAb but not of anti-CR1 mAb of the same isotype to compete for the binding of biotinylated anti-CR2 mAb to T cells. The intensity of staining of T lymphocytes with anti-CR2 mAb was approximately 10-fold lower than that of peripheral blood B cells. CR2 was immunoprecipitated from purified T lymphocytes as a single protein of apparent Mr 145,000. The presence of CR2 on normal human T lymphocytes suggests that the receptor may modulate the function of T cells in the immune response and the susceptibility of the cells to infection by lymphocytotropic viruses.\r"

  ".U": "91108055\r", 
  ".W": "Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a B cell tumor affecting the pre-plasma stage of B cell differentiation. Hairy cells produce B cell growth factor (BCGF)-related growth factor(s) and we have previously shown that low mol wt (LMW)-BCGF-induced proliferation of hairy cells is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by IFN-alpha. We therefore suggested that this effect might contribute to the exquisite sensitivity of HCL to IFN-alpha therapy. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha, we have analyzed the pattern of phosphorylated proteins in hairy cells. We detected the presence of a hyperphosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa. This protein was identified as the CD20 molecule (B1), which is a structurally unique phosphoprotein exclusively detected on B cells and expressed during most stages of B cell development. Incubation of hairy cells with mitogenic concentrations of LMW-BCGF induces an additional increase in CD20 protein phosphorylation. In contrast, preincubation of cells with IFN-alpha, but not IFN-gamma, decreases both basal and LMW-BCGF-induced CD20 phosphorylation. CD20 phosphorylation in hairy cells is also reduced after in vivo IFN-alpha administration. In contrast, in one case of a patient unresponsive to IFN-alpha therapy, CD20 phosphorylation is not altered by in vitro IFN-alpha treatment, whereas LMW-BCGF still elicits CD20 phosphorylation stimulation. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha may act in HCL, at least in part, by inhibiting leukemic cell proliferation via regulation of phosphorylation, since CD20 phosphorylation is thought to be associated with cellular proliferation. A model involving dysregulation of CD20 is discussed.\r"

In SJL mice, the V beta-17a gene product has been shown to be used by approximately 50% of encephalitogenic T cells subsequent to immunization with a myelin basic protein (MBP)-derived peptide. However, the other V beta genes used by encephalitogenic T cells in SJL EAE have remained uncharacterized. We now report, for the first time, the beta-chain-encoding DNA sequence of two encephalitogenic, MBP-reactive, SJL-derived T cell clones. These clones which are specific for H-2s and the carboxyl-terminus (amino acid 92-103) of MBP, use TCR encoded by V beta-4. In addition, we demonstrate that the transfer of EAE by a heterogenous SJL-derived encephalitogenic T cell line can be prevented using an anti-V beta-4 antibody in vivo. V beta-4 usage has been previously described in a H-2u/MBP amino-terminus-reactive encephalitogenic T cell. The present findings may thus further support the \"V region-disease\" hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "TU27, a mouse IgG1 mAb directed at the p75 chain of the human IL-2R, was analyzed for its ability to interact with IL-2 binding on isolated p75 chains (YT-2C2 cells) and high affinity p55/p75 receptors (human alloreactive T cell clone 4AS), to inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation (4AS cells) and to cooperate with an anti-p55 chain mAb (33B3.1) for inhibiting IL-2 binding and proliferation. TU27 and IL-2 bound to the isolated p75 chain expressed by YT-2C2 cells with respective dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.3 and 1 nM. They cross-inhibited each other for binding with inhibition constants (Ki) in agreement with their respective Kd values. The nature of the interaction was, however, not purely competitive and suggested nonidentical epitopes for the two ligands on the p75 chain. On 4AS cells, IL-2 bound with high affinity (Kd = 50 pM) and TU27 with an affinity similar to that found on YT-2C2 cells. The binding of TU27 and IL-2 were also mutually exclusive on 4AS cells. However, the mechanism of interaction of TU27 with IL-2 was complex since the inhibitory potency of the antibody depended on temperature, antibody preincubation and time of assay. Data obtained at 4 degrees C in the presence of suboptimal, tracer-like concentrations of IL-2 indicated that the intrinsic affinity of TU27 for the high affinity configuration was 15-fold lower than for the isolated p75 chain and argued in favor of the affinity-conversion model (as opposed to the preformed complex model) in which p55 and p75 are dissociated in the absence of IL-2. At 37 degrees C, TU27 inhibited IL-2 binding only on short time assays (6 min). Longer time (30 min) of IL-2 binding resulted in an almost complete disappearance of the effect of TU27, suggesting that internalization of the high affinity p55/p75/IL2 complex enables the cells to escape from the inhibitory effect of TU27. In the presence of the 33B3.1 mAb, the interaction of TU27 with IL-2 resembled the one observed on YT-2C2 cells, suggesting that 33B3.1 is able to inhibit the IL-2-induced association of p55 and p75. Both antibody were found to synergize on 4AS cells, as a result of a cooperative mechanism in which 33B3.1 blocks the formation of the high affinity complex hence allowing TU27 to bind with higher affinity, and TU27 blocks IL-2 binding to the p75 chain. Proliferation studies corroborated the binding experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To initiate this structure and activity analysis, four neutralizing mAb were selected on the basis of preventing rhuIL-3 stimulated proliferation of peripheral blood cells from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In order to identify continuous epitopes, the neutralizing mAb were assayed in a solid-phase ELISA for their reactivity with either denatured rhuIL-3 or with the peptides generated by digestion of rhuIL-3 by using two different proteinases. Two of the neutralizing mAb recognized single fragments from both digestions. Amino acid (aa) sequence determination showed that these peptides overlap, defining a region of 22 aa (aa 29 to 50 of the mature rhuIL-3 protein). In a competition ELISA, the two continuous epitopes were shown to be linked to one another and to the two discontinuous epitopes, suggesting that all four neutralizing mAb bind to a discrete region of the IL-3 molecule, which might be involved in binding to the IL-3R.\r"

Introduction of this vector into a nonsecreting murine myeloma cell line resulted in the production of a chimeric molecule (IL-2/IgG1) consisting of IL-2 attached to the three Ig constant region domains. This molecule was secreted by the transfectant as a homodimer. Functional characterization revealed that the IL-2/IgG1 chimeric molecule exhibited the binding and proliferation-mediating activities of IL-2. On a per molecule basis, IL-2/IgG1 was indistinguishable from human rIL-2 in the ability to induce the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell line. This chimeric molecule also possesses Ig effector function, in that it can mediate the specific lysis of IL-2R-positive cells in the presence of complement. These results demonstrate that it is possible to maintain Ig effector function in molecules (\"immunoligands\") in which the binding specificity is conferred not by Ig variable regions, but rather, by a ligand of choice.\r"

Selective binding of foreign antigenic peptides could then be allowed by the dissociation of Ii molecules from Ia in the appropriate intracellular compartment. In this study, we have examined the structure and intracellular trafficking patterns of a putative proteolytic product of Ii, p25. We found that p25 is a non-membrane-bound fragment of Ii with an N terminus beginning at Met98 of the Ii sequence. p25 is formed at a very early stage of Ii synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum rather than in a post-Golgi Ag-processing compartment. We have also characterized a second Ii-related species, p28, which has not been reported previously. The p28 form of Ii, unlike p25, is generated under acidic conditions similar to those found during Ag processing.\r"

Because the major mitogenic component of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) is SPA, it is possible that SAC stimulates a subpopulation of B cells expressing Ig of the VHIII H chain subgroup. In the present study, we have investigated further the relationship between SPA binding and the expression of VHI- or VHIII-associated cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) on the surface of tonsillar B lymphocytes enriched for the expression or nonexpression of the CRI, and we examined the Ig secreted by cell lines established from these populations of B cells by EBV transformation. The VHIII CRI (D12)-enriched population yielded 21 cell lines, with 67% of them secreting SPA-reactive Ig; in contrast, only 6% (1 of 16) of VHI CRI-expressing lines secreted SPA-reactive Ig. The CRI-negative B cell population yielded 54 cell lines, of which 20% secreted SPA-reactive Ig, as might be anticipated because a majority of VHIII Ig+ B cells will be CRI-. SAC stimulation of CRI+ and CRI- populations showed preferential stimulation of the D12 population. These data support the proposal that SAC stimulation of human B cells is mediated through binding of SPA by its alternative binding site to IgV regions of the VHIII subgroup.\r"

To investigate their role in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) we analyzed the Id of rat anti-AChR mAb 6, 35, 61, 65 and a control myeloma protein IR27. Anti-Id 6, 35, 61, 65 bound in a direct binding assay with various affinity to all rat anti-AChR mAb that were tested. Anti-Id IR27 recognized none of the anti-AChR mAb. The specificity of these crossreactions was confirmed by inhibition studies with anti-AChR mAb and two control rat myeloma proteins (IR27 and IR241). In addition, the Id expression on mAb D6, a mouse anti-human AChR mAb was recognized by anti-Id 6, 35, and 65. Anti-Id, except anti-Id IR27, bound to affinity purified IgG from the sera of rats with EAMG, but not to preimmune Lewis IgG. These results suggest extensive sharing of idiotopes among anti-AChR mAb, which are also present in EAMG serum. Anti-AChR mAb against the main immunogenic region (6, 35, 65) from different rat strains, shared at least one paratope-related cross-reactive idiotopes. In the view of the fact that anti-main immunogenic region antibodies might form a predominant fraction of the polyclonal response against AChR, it is conceivable that an anti-Id recognizing these antibodies could have therapeutical applications as for example a selective immune absorbent or in immunotoxin therapy.\r"

CD45 has protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and appears to regulate signal transduction and lymphocyte activation by specific association with receptor molecules on T and B lymphocytes. However, little is known about CD45 function in neutrophils (PMN). In this study, PMN were incubated with CD45 mAb and tested for their chemotactic responses to four unrelated chemo-attractants: FMLP, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), recombinant human C5a (C5a), and recombinant human neutrophil-activating protein-1, recently designated IL-8. A panel of CD45 mAb including an IgM mAb, AHN-12.1, and six IgG1 mAb, AHN-12, AHN-12.2, AHN-12.3, AHN-12.4, HLe-1, and KC56(T200), were tested for their effects on PMN chemotaxis. PMN chemotaxis was evaluated with two different membrane assays; one assay quantified the total number of migrating PMN and the other assayed the leading front of migrating PMN. AHN-12.1 and KC56(T200) significantly inhibited PMN chemotaxis to LTB4 and C5a. AHN-12.1 slightly inhibited PMN chemotaxis to FMLP, but KC56(T200) did not. In contrast, AHN-12 and HLe-1 did not significantly inhibit PMN chemotaxis to any of the chemoattractants. None of the CD45 mAb inhibited PMN chemotaxis to neutrophil-activating protein-1/IL-8. None of the CD45 mAb inhibited PMN superoxide production. These results suggest that PMN CD45 epitopes may interact with LTB4 and C5a receptor-associated molecules and regulate chemotactic responses.\r"

Although such transfected COS cells fail to exhibit some of the early biochemical perturbations initiated by aggregation of the receptor on normal mast cells and related tumor lines, we show here that other characteristics of the endogenous Fc epsilon RI are retained. Thus, the unaggregated transfected wild-type receptors were found to have a restricted translational diffusion similar to that observed for endogenous receptors on mast cells as assessed by fluorescence photobleaching and recovery. Similarly, as with endogenous receptors the mobility of transfected receptors was sharply reduced when the receptors were aggregated by reaction with small oligomers of IgE. In addition, aggregation of the transfected Fc epsilon RI caused them to be internalized by the COS cells by a cytochalasin-sensitive mechanism, albeit at a considerably slower rate than was seen with endogenous receptors on mast cells or with transfected receptors in a line of receptor-deficient mast cells. We also examined the mobility and internalization before and after aggregation, of some 13 different combinations of receptor subunit mutants in which one or more of the five cytoplasmic domains of the receptor had been truncated. Our results show that whatever interactions between the receptor and cellular components may account for the phenomena we studied, such interactions do not critically depend upon the bulk of the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor.\r"

Inhibition of actin microfilament (MF) assembly and stability by cytochalasins B and D completely inhibited M phi phagocytosis of sheep E coated with C3b (EC3b), iC3b (EC3bi), and IgG (EIgG) via CR1, CR3, and FcR, respectively. Ligand-binding to either CR or FcR was not effected by cytochalasins. Nocodazole (NOC), which prevents microtubule (MT) polymerization, and taxol, which causes random polymerization of MT inhibited M phi phagocytosis of EC3b(i) but not EIgG. However, the combination of taxol (5 x 10(-4) M) and NOC (2 x 10(-6) M) augmented M phi CR-mediated phagocytosis. In addition, agents known to increase intracellular cGMP augmented phagocytosis of EC3b(i). Conversely, agents that increase intracellular cAMP inhibited CR-mediated phagocytosis. These agents had no effect on FcR-mediated phagocytosis, and did not effect ligand-binding to CR or FcR. PMA markedly enhanced CR- but not FcR-mediated phagocytosis, and augmentation of CR-mediated phagocytosis by PMA was inhibited by both CD and NOC. In contrast, the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol augmented, and inhibitors of protein kinase C inhibited M phi phagocytosis via CR and FcR. These data indicate that for adherently cultured human M phi: 1) binding of ligand-coated E to CR or FcR does not require an intact cytoskeleton; 2) intact actin microfilament are required for phagocytosis via CR and FcR; 3) phagocytosis via CR1 and CR3 but not FcR is dependent on MT assembly; 4) PMA most likely augments CR-mediated phagocytosis through promotion of MT assembly; and 5) PKC activity is involved in the phagocytic signal generated by both CR and FcR.\r"

  ".U": "91108069\r", 
  ".W": "The kinetics of receptor up-regulation was examined in isolated neutrophils and in whole blood by flow cytometry during cell activation. Stimulation of neutrophils prepared without exposure to LPS with chemoattractants induced fast up-regulation of N-formyl peptide receptors and C receptor type 3 (CR3). Biphasic N-formyl peptide binding curves were detected for saturating concentrations of N-formyl peptide at 37 degrees C. The bulk of the rapid binding during the first 30 to 60 s is attributed to already expressed binding sites whereas the slow binding over the next 3 to 4 min represents a time course of receptor up-regulation. Support for this interpretation comes from conditions under which the number of binding sites and the progress of the binding curves were affected. Cells treated with LPS, which caused expression of internal N-formyl peptide receptors, exhibited rapid, monophasic binding curves with increased total binding. In LPS-untreated, calcium-depleted cells, N-formyl peptide receptor up-regulation was inhibited and rapid, monophasic binding to a smaller total number of expressed sites was observed. Cytochalasin B enhanced the total number of available N-formyl peptide receptors in LPS-untreated but not LPS-treated cells. In both cases binding was rapid and monophasic suggesting that receptors were either fully or rapidly up-regulated. Although not studied in real-time, C receptor type 3 up-regulation was similar to N-formyl peptide receptor up-regulation in response to LPS, or stimulation by N-formyl peptide, C product C5a, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor in isolated cells and in whole blood. After stimulation with formyl peptide, LPS, or C product 5a, the release of vitamin B12-binding protein paralleled up-regulation of receptors. These data indicate that untreated cells up-regulate N-formyl peptide receptors during cell response at a rate of approximately 10,000/min in a calcium-dependent manner whereas LPS-treated cells already express the bulk of their receptors. In cytochalasin B-treated, degranulating cells 30,000 to 50,000 receptors were up-regulated within a minute.\r"

Fibroblasts support the in vitro survival but not proliferation of mouse connective-tissue type mast cells. However, the factor(s) that allow their survival on fibroblast monolayers has not been identified. We have investigated the presence of mRNA for IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF in single mouse mast cells, before and after co-culture with 3T3 fibroblasts, using the polymerase chain reaction technique. The system was calibrated first by using in vitro generated population of mouse bone-marrow derived mast cells (BMMC). Significant differences in the amplification of IL-3 cDNA were observed in each of the BMMC cells examined, whereas the amplification of cDNA for the alpha-subunit of the Fc epsilon RI were similar. Inasmuch as murine cultured IL-3-dependent mast cells differentiate into connective tissue-like mast cells when co-cultured with 3T3 fibroblasts without any exogenous supply of growth factors, it was of interest to determine whether these connective tissue-like mast cells produce IL-3 message. Separation of the differentiated BMMC from the fibroblast monolayer, by either trypsinization or by single cell manipulation revealed the synthesis of a detectable amount of IL-3 mRNA in these mast cells. Whether this IL-3 mRNA was induced by fibroblasts was further investigated using connective tissue mast cells freshly purified from the mouse peritoneal cavity. Only about 20% of these connective tissue mast cells produced detectable amount of granulocyte-macrophage-CSF mRNA whereas in less than 10% of the cells IL-3 mRNA was detected. However, when these connective tissue mast cells were co-cultured with 3T3 fibroblasts for 18 hours and then separated, IL-3 mRNA were detected in most of the cells whereas no such mRNA was detected in tissue mast cells incubated for 18 h with medium derived from 3T3 fibroblasts. Therefore we conclude that fibroblasts induce the accumulation of IL-3 mRNA in connective tissue mast cells. The production of IL-3 may play a role in the survival of this type of mast cells on the fibroblast monolayer.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on the role of microtubule integrity in stimulus-response coupling in neutrophils have generated contradictory data. To determine the role of microtubule integrity in stimulus-response coupling elicited by two different mechanisms, i.e., engagement of the Fc receptors (FcR gamma II, FcR gamma III) or engagement of the receptor for FMLP, we utilized colchicine (10 microM), which reduces pericentriolar microtubules to 29% of control, and compared its effect with that of nocodazole (50 microM) and lumicolchicine (10 microM). We now demonstrate that treatment of neutrophils with colchicine but not lumicolchicine, inhibits degranulation elicited by engagement of Fc receptors but augments degranulation in response to FMLP. In contrast to the ligand-specific effect of microtubule-disruption on degranulation, superoxide anion production (assembly of the NADPH oxidase) is unaffected by colchicine regardless of the ligand. To determine whether intact microtubules were required for responses elicited by ligation of Fc gamma RII(CD32) or Fc gamma RIII(CD16), mAb directed against these receptors were employed. Treatment of neutrophils with mAb KuFc79 directed against Fc gamma RII(CD32) or mAb 3G8 directed against Fc gamma RIII(CD16) inhibited degranulation of neutrophils elicited by immune complexes (IC). In contrast, removal of most of Fc gamma RIII by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not significantly alter degranulation in response to IC. We conclude that degranulation elicited by IC results from ligation of both Fc gamma RII and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-insensitive Fc gamma RIII. The importance of microtubule integrity on the generation of intracellular signals was also examined. Degranulation of neutrophils proceeds via pertussis toxin-sensitive and insensitive pathways; treatment of cells with colchicine did not augment the action of pertussis toxin. Stimulation of neutrophils by chemoattractants results in a biphasic increase in 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol; a rapid increase (\"triggering\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and a late increase (\"activation\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. Treatment of cells with colchicine altered the production of both [3H]-arachidonic acid-diacylglycerol and diacyl[14C]glycerol in parallel to its effect on degranulation. These studies indicate that the requirement of intact microtubules for degranulation is ligand-specific. Furthermore, assembly of the respiratory burst oxidase does not require intact microtubules. Microtubules most likely alter the cycling of specific receptors or the generation of specific intracellular signals required for stimulus-response coupling in the course of degranulation. Intact microtubules are not uniformly required for the discharge of granule contents during exocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) express two classes of Fc gamma R: Fc gamma RII the 42-kDa receptor with a traditional membrane spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail and Fc gamma RIIIPMN the 50- to 80-kDa receptor with a glycosyl-phatidylinositol membrane anchor expressed on PMN. To explore the capacity of Fc gamma RIIIPMN to generate intracellular signals, we have analyzed the ability of Fab and F(ab')2 anti-Fc gamma R mAb to induce actin filament assembly, a prerequisite for motile behaviors. Multivalent ligation of Fc gamma RIIIPMN, independent of Fc gamma RII, results in an increase in F-actin content that is [Ca2+]i dependent. Multivalent ligation of Fc gamma RII also initiates actin polymerization but uses a [Ca2+]i-independent initial pathway. In addition to providing a mechanism for Fc gamma RIIIPMN triggered effector functions, the increase in F-actin and [Ca2+]i generated by Fc gamma RIIIPMN ligation also serves as a \"priming\" signal to modify PMN responses to other stimuli. Experiments using erythrocytes specifically coated with anti-Fc gamma RII Fab demonstrate that cross-linking of Fc gamma RIIIPMN with anti-Fc gamma RIII F(ab')2 enhances phagocytosis mediated by Fc gamma RII. Thus, Fc gamma RIIIPMN, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored protein, may contribute directly to an intracellular program of actin assembly that may trigger and prime neutrophil effector functions.\r"

It was produced in genetically engineered yeast as a denatured molecule incapable of binding CD4. A synthetic lipophilic muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) was used as an adjuvant. Ten subjects received adjuvant alone and 15 received 50- or 250-micrograms doses of env2-3 (SF2) administered intramuscularly in two immunization regimens. In general, adjuvant and vaccine were well tolerated. Antibody responses to both the homologous antigen, env2-3 (SF2), and antigens from other highly divergent HIV isolates were elicited in the majority of vaccine recipients. However, antibody titers were low, without neutralizing activity. In 9 of 11 subjects who received the complete vaccine immunization series, a significant specific T lymphocyte response was observed.\r"

Lymph node size was measured in 12 sites semiannually over 4 years. Both adenopathy and hyperglobulinemia developed within 1 year after seroconversion and persisted at high levels. Adenopathy declined near diagnosis of AIDS whereas serum IgG decreased 8-16 months after diagnosis. Adenopathy attributable to HIV occurred in all palpable node groups. By logistic regression, HIV-positive men were best discriminated from HIV-negative men by size of posterior cervical nodes and the number of sites with enlarged nodes. In a repeated measures model of covariance, adenopathy in HIV-positive men was associated with more CD4+ cells (P less than .002), elevated serum globulins (P less than .01), and lower platelet counts (P less than .05). Adenopathy declined over time (P less than .001) and with diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (P less than .03). Thus, adenopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia are correlated and follow a similar course through various stages of HIV infection, suggesting that both are caused by polyclonal B cell activation.\r"

Of 270 participants tested for HTLV-I/II, 21 (8%) were seropositive. Of those, 15 (71%) had HTLV-II-specific sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 (5%) had both HTLV-I- and -II-specific sequences; 3 persons with indeterminate serologic results were also PCR-positive for HTLV-II. HTLV-II infection was significantly associated with older age but was not predicted by sex, race, socioeconomic status, transfusion history, or HIV infection status. Behavioral factors since 1978, such as duration and frequency of intravenous drug use, needle sharing, visits to shooting galleries, or number of sex partners, were also not associated with HTLV-II infection. These findings are in contrast with the association of these risk factors with HIV in this group and suggest that, among IVDUs, HTLV-II is an older endemic infection that is less efficiently transmitted than HIV.\r"

Western blot immunoreactivity with two or more HTLV-I proteins was present in 81% of the ELISA positives; however, there was no reactivity with the env proteins. The frequency of this indeterminate immunoreactivity increased with the malaria antibody titer. None of the 200 Bacolod sera were Western blot immunoreactive. In competitive serologic assays, an HTLV-I lysate blocked the HTLV-I immunoreactivity of the Napsan sera but did not reduce malaria antibody. A Plasmodium falciparum lysate blocked both the HTLV-I and malaria immunoreactivity of the Napsan sera. These results show that indeterminate HTLV-I immunoreactivity can be caused by P. falciparum antibody. Serosurveys conducted in malaria endemic areas should consider this possibility.\r"

All of the anti-gC and anti-gD MAbs, and one of four anti-gB MAbs (B6) were protective. The in vitro abilities of the MAbs to neutralize HSV-1 and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HSV-1-infected cells were examined as potential mechanistic correlates to in vivo protection. All animals given MAbs at high ADCC unit doses were protected. Some but not all mice given MAbs at high ADCC unit doses were protected. These studies designate specific epitopes recognized by protective antibodies and indicate that protection from the neurologic spread of HSV may be related to neutralization, ADCC, or both. The actual contribution of ADCC and neutralization to in vivo antibody-mediated protection remains unclear.\r"

At a concentration fourfold higher than the EC50, HPMPC completely inhibited CMV growth, whereas DHPG still allowed it. Carbocyclic 3-deazaadenosine, recognized as an S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitor, had an EC50 of 13.7 micrograms/ml and a selectivity index of 29. These results suggest that HPMPC should be further pursued for its usefulness in the treatment of CMV infections and SAH hydrolase inhibitors represent potentially important anti-CMV agents.\r"

Fetal viability and weight were significantly lower in infected BALB/c mothers (H-2d) than in CBA(H-2k) and BALB.K(H-2k) mothers. However, fetal infection was not detected, suggesting that the resistance mechanisms operate at the level of the mother or placenta. By directly inoculating fetuses in utero, it was shown that genetic factors in the fetus can influence the level of fetal infection and viability. These results point to the possibility that host genetic factors may modulate maternal and fetal cytomegalovirus infections in humans.\r"

Of 121 pregnant women who had not requested testing but who lived in a community where a large outbreak of EI had occurred among schoolchildren, 36% (43/121) had serologic evidence of previous infection, and only 3% (2/78) of the rest had had a recent infection. In the exposed group, 479 women returned a supplemental exposure questionnaire. The highest infection rates among susceptible women were for schoolteachers (16%, 10/64), followed by day care workers (9%, 2/22) and homemakers (9%, 4/46). Women working outside the home but not in school or day care settings had the lowest risk (4%, 3/80). This study suggests that there is risk for B19 infection in selected occupational settings and in households.\r"

However, genetic analysis of the VP1 genome region of published HAV sequences suggested that distinct genotypes of HAV could be defined based upon the geographic source of the original isolates. To circumvent the process of cell culture adaptation or animal passage, a 247-bp segment within the VP1 genome region of wild-type HAV was amplified by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in the presence of negative- and positive-sense primers. From the sequences obtained from 22 epidemiologically distinct HAV isolates, three genetic groups of HAV could be delineated. Two of the groups differed by 10%, while the third group differed from other isolates by approximately 20%. These investigations indicate that HAV isolates from different parts of the world can be differentiated genetically, which will facilitate studies of epidemiologic transmission.\r"

Therefore, Ad31 isolates from immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts were compared by restriction endonuclease analysis. Nine genome types were identified among the 79 Ad31 isolates. Pairwise comparison of comigrating restriction fragments indicated that the genome types could be divided into three genomic clusters. Several Ad31 genome types were isolated from immunocompromised patients, but no highly virulent genome type could be found. A genome type was identified in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency who originally was infected with another genome type. This observation is suggested to have evolutionary implications.\r"

Positive IgG antibodies were seen in 248 (26.1%), in contrast to 3.9%-6.0% in two groups of controls (n = 101). Of the orienteers, 1.9%-3.1% had a past history of definite or probable clinical Lyme borreliosis. Six months later a second blood sample was obtained from 755 participants, 558 (73.9%) of whom were seronegative initially; 45 (8.1%) had seroconverted from negative to positive. Only 1 (2.2%) developed clinical Lyme borreliosis. Among all participants, the 6-month incidence of clinical Lyme borreliosis was 0.8% (6/755) but was much higher (8.1%) for asymptomatic seroconversion (45/558). In conclusion, positive Lyme serology was common in Swiss orienteers, but clinical disease occurred infrequently.\r"

Eighty-five women hospitalized for AUPN were randomly assigned to receive either Amp, 1 g intravenously (iv) every 6 h for 3 days, then 500 mg orally four times daily, or TMP/SMZ, 160/800 mg iv every 12 h for 3 days, then 160/800 mg orally twice daily.

Antimicrobial resistance necessitated modifying therapy of 14 (32%) of the Amp recipients but of none of the TMP/SMZ recipients (P less than .001). Both regimens produced a satisfactory bacteriologic and clinical response in all cases. Reinfection occurred in 11% of Amp and in 8% of TMP/SMZ recipients. No patient experienced relapsing infection. The TMP/SMZ regimen was less costly and less likely to require modification due to antimicrobial resistance.\r"

Il-6 is secreted in response to Escherichia coli infection of the urinary tract. This study tested the hypothesis that the level of fever, CRP, and ESR is coregulated in individual patients. Body temperature, CRP, ESR, pyuria, and renal concentrating capacity were analyzed in 692 children with first-time urinary tract infections. The association of the parameters was evaluated by correlation and multiple regression analysis. The body temperature, CRP, and ESR were significantly correlated (r = .54, .58, and .58; P less than .001), and variation in CRP and ESR explained approximately 40% of the variation in fever. In contrast, the renal concentrating capacity and pyruia were weakly or not at all correlated with the febrile response (r = -.22; P less than .001), and less than 10% of the variation in renal concentrating capacity was explained by the other parameters. The results suggest that fever, CRP, and ESR describe the same aspect of the host response to UTI.\r"

A short vaccination schedule of three doses of 10(11) live organisms over 5 days induced significantly greater intestinal IgA antityphoid antibody responses than did two comparable doses 21 days apart. The humoral immune response was dose dependent with 10(10) and 10(11) live organisms stimulating greater intestinal immune responses than did 10(11) killed organisms. No responses were evident with either 10(9) viable organisms or with an enteric-coated preparation.

For the anti-E. coli pair, the IgM MAb was 1000-fold more potent in all assay formats. Importantly, the 50% protection dose (PD50) of the IgM MAb was 10-20 ng/rat, while 100 micrograms of the IgG MAb was only minimally protective. For the group B streptococcal MAbs, the IgM was 100- and 4500-fold more potent in binding and opsonization assays, respectively. However, while 20 micrograms of IgM protected neonatal rats, 100 micrograms of IgG MAb was partly protective. These experiments demonstrate the utility of recombinant DNA technology for creating a panel of antibodies that may aid in selecting potential immunotherapeutic candidates.\r"

Antibody affinity correlated with toxin neutralization in in vivo and in vitro assays but was not the only determinant of protection against Bordetella pertussis infection. B9, a high-affinity anti-S3 antibody, was the most effective in neutralizing toxin-induced CHO cell clustering and hemagglutination in vitro and lymphocytosis and histamine sensitization in vivo. A4, a similar-affinity anti-S1 antibody, was less active in the toxin neutralization assays but more protective in the mouse infection model. A12, a low-affinity anti-S1 antibody, was least active in the assays of toxin neutralization but as effective as B9 in the infection model. These data suggest that epitopes on the A protomer and B oligomer may induce protective immunity. Measurement of pertussis toxin neutralization by monoclonal antibodies in in vitro and in vivo assays may not accurately predict protection against infection with B. pertussis.\r"

  ".W": "Conidia, produced by the mycelial phase of dimorphic fungi, are thought to represent the infectious form of the organism but must complete a transition to the tissue-invasive, yeast-like phase for infection to ensue. Preventing such transition should effectively eliminate pathogenicity. Using Blastomyces dermatitidis as a target, murine bronchoalveolar macrophages preferentially blocked phase transition after 4 h of incubation with conidia, relatively sparing the ability of conidia to produce hyphae. H2O2, in relatively high concentrations, demonstrated the same activity. The effects of H2O2 seem irreversible, since H2O2-treated conidia that germinated at 48 h at 25 degrees C were still unable to produce yeasts over the next 5 days when incubated at 37 degrees C. Catalase could not reverse the macrophage-induced inhibition of phase transition, suggesting that nonoxidative defense mechanisms may be operative in vivo. Since conidia do not form mycelia at temperatures found in mammalian hosts, these effects may represent a novel host defense mechanism against dimorphic fungal pathogens.\r"

All donors were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels. None of the 206 plasma samples was positive for HBV DNA by dot blot hybridization assay. However, nine samples were positive for HBV DNA by PCR using two primer pairs specific for surface and core regions. Nine persons received the HBV-DNA-positive plasma, and one developed posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis; the others remained well 6 months later. Therefore, approximately 4% of blood donors in Taiwan have low titers of HBV DNA, and a more sensitive method to screen donors may be needed in the future, although the current serologic test remains the most practical at present.\r"

To determine if recent isolates from Mexico were related to those that caused epidemics of dysentery worldwide, Southern hybridization analysis was done with Shiga toxin and ribosomal RNA gene probes. Western hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere strains differed by the size of a single EcoRI fragment carrying the Shiga toxin genes. Three ribosomal DNA (rDNA) patterns were observed, which correlated with the strain's continental origin for 81 of 83 isolates tested. Together the Shiga toxin and rDNA probe results indicated that recent Mexican isolates were chromosomally similar to earlier Central American isolates and distinct from Asian and African strains. This suggests there has been no significant exchange of organisms between continents in recent decades and that the 1988 outbreak in Mexico was caused by strains present in Central America since at least 1962.\r"

This screening ELISA detects antibodies to all virulent yersiniae in one assay and offers the possibility for diagnosis of infections caused by Yersinia serotypes seen only occasionally and not usually included in the serotype-specific ELISAs. Thus, this ELISA offers a substantial advantage by saving time and money in routine laboratory work.\r"

This transfected cell line, designated MS1, expressed SV-40 large T antigen and showed continuous cell growth with a doubling time of 27 hours. The MS1 cells had distinct Schwann cell phenotypes such as S-100 protein, laminin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase and P0 protein, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. When MS1 cells were exposed to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (dbc AMP), they extended long bipolar processes two- to ten-fold longer than those of untreated MS1 cells and frequently formed whorl-like alignments similar to palisade formations or organoid patterns observed in human Schwannomas and neurofibromas. These results suggest that transformed Schwann cells can be a useful model for analyzing regulatory mechanisms of Schwann cells, neuron-Schwann cell interactions and experimental Schwann cell neoplasms in vitro.\r"

Groups of mice were immunized with 20, 50, or 100 nmol of the peptide and were killed from seven to 28 days after sensitization or when they were moribund. Beginning on Day 9, the mice showed signs of EAE and the disease progressed rapidly to paralysis. Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, edema, gliosis, and demyelination were found in all mice killed between Days 10 and 28 and white matter lesion areas correlated with clinical score at the time the mice were killed. Peripheral nerve roots and the cauda equina did not have lesions. Within the range studied, the severity of clinical or histologic disease was the same regardless of the PLP peptide dose. Two of ten mice immunized with 100 nmol and none of 14 mice given smaller doses of a synthetic peptide of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) showed clinical EAE. These mice had small numbers of CNS lesions that were indistinguishable from those in PLP peptide-sensitized mice. These findings demonstrate that immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP peptide 139-151 produces a disease with the clinical and morphologic features of CNS tissue-, whole PLP-, whole MBP-, and MBP peptide-induced acute EAE. Thus, PLP is a major encephalitogen and immune reactions to epitopes of different myelin proteins may induce identical patterns of injury in the CNS.\r"

In the present work, the absorption of a saline solution of MBP from the peritoneal cavity into the mediastinal lymph nodes was increased by giving repeated inoculations or by pretreating rats with a peritoneal irritant. Under these conditions, the only adjuvant needed for production of EAE was aqueous pertussis vaccine which was injected separately a few hours or one day after the MBP. Pertussis vaccine was also necessary for production of EAE with intradermal injection of aqueous MBP. By injecting the aqueous MBP directly into pre-enlarged popliteal lymph nodes, it was possible to produce EAE without the pertussis vaccine. Thus, EAE can be induced in rats using MBP without the addition of Freund's adjuvant or pertussis vaccine.\r"

Six animal subgroups included rats whose brain temperature was maintained at 30, 33, 36 or 39 degrees C during 20 minutes (min) of 4-vessel occlusion. Control rats without ischemia had brain temperature maintained between 30 and 39 degrees C for a 20 min period. After a 45 min postischemic recirculation period, rats were injected with the protein tracer, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and perfusion fixed 5 or 15 min later. Control rats showed no leakage of the tracer protein. Postischemic rats in which brain temperature was controlled at either 30 or 33 degrees C failed to demonstrate consistent BBB alterations. In contrast, foci of cortical HRP extravasation were consistently documented in rats whose intraischemic brain temperature was 36 degrees C. Permeability alterations were more widespread in the 39 degrees C ischemic group and occurred in cortical, thalamic, hippocampal and striatal regions. The HRP extravasation frequently involved arterioles surrounded by perivascular spaces. Routes of increased permeability to HRP included endothelial pinocytosis, opening of the interendothelial tight junctions and diffuse leakage through damaged endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that brain temperature is a critical factor in determining whether BBB dysfunction is an acute consequence of a transient cerebral ischemic insult.\r"

The earliest morphologic changes in the liver occurred at 12 h pi, and consisted of a slight increase in fat and loss of glycogen in hepatocytes. Over the next 36 h, the accumulation of microvesicular fat increased, and mitochondrial abnormalities such as pleomorphism and loss of dense bodies developed. There was no increase in peroxisomes. In the brain, focal cerebral edema was detected as early at 6-12 h pi. The edema, manifested as swelling of astrocytic foot processes, increased in severity with time. Endothelial cells were not abnormal. Myelin sheath splitting rarely was observed. Since changes occurred simultaneously in the liver and in the brain, we suggest that influenza B virus caused a simultaneous primary insult to both organs.\r"

Down's syndrome was distinguished from Alzheimer's disease by the 19% lower mean brain weight which was associated with more pronounced reductions in the areas of both cortex and white matter. However, the differences were most striking in the anterior frontal and anterior temporal regions where the effects of arrested neurodevelopment are grossly evident. In addition, in Down's syndrome the amygdala was significantly smaller than in Alzheimer's disease. In both Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, shrinkage of the cortical ribbon was associated with abundant neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, while white matter atrophy was associated with histopathological evidence of axonal degeneration. These findings suggest that in Down's syndrome the reduction in volume in the posterior portion of the cerebrum relative to controls is largely due to acquired lesions of Alzheimer's disease, whereas anteriorly and within certain subcortical nuclei, the effects of both Alzheimer's disease and arrested neurodevelopment are manifested. Moreover, the finding of white matter lesions in Down's syndrome corroborates the notion that white matter degeneration is a fundamental component of the Alzheimer's disease process.\r"

OMT were distributed in the brain stem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia where severe neurodegenerative changes were consistently observed. In 45 control cases, no OMT were found regardless of the presence or absence of neurological disorders. The OMT were immunostained by anti-tubulin antibodies, but no other antibodies reacted with them. Each OMT consisted of a meshwork of randomly oriented fibrils studded with granular and fuzzy material. The fibrillary elements were between 20 and 30 nm in diameter. It is suggested that OMT are primarily composed of altered microtubules, and are related to the neurodegenerative process of OPCA.\r"

All 12 patients had limitation of upward gaze, impairment of convergence and horizontal gaze nystagmus. However, none had abnormalities of pupillary shape or light reflexes. Impairments of saccadic and pursuit eye movements were frequently present. Further, difficulty of eyelid opening, bulging eyes, impairment of optokinetic and caloric responses and square wave jerks were seen in some of the patients. The autopsy examination of 1 patient revealed marked neuronal loss in the oculomotor nucleus with preservation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and neuronal decrease, myelin loss and gliosis of the dorsal midbrain including superior colliculus, pretectum and posterior commissures. Disturbance of upward gaze, sparing of pupillary light reflexes and horizontal gaze nystagmus were frequent and early symptoms. The pattern of oculomotor disturbances is different from that of OPCA and evaluation of the oculomotor system is useful for clinical diagnosis of the disease.\r"

It was observed that the Achilles reflexogram showed a marked prolongation of contraction and relaxation time and that in both quadriceps and triceps surae mechanical percussion induced a marked myxoedema and prolonged relaxation time. The EMG of these muscles during voluntary contraction and stopping reaction detected an excessive recruitment of the antagonistic muscles, starting without any abnormal delay, a finding at variance with a typical cerebellar pattern. Post-urographic analysis gave a pattern of oscillations still within the normal range. These findings suggest that the gait alterations of our patient depended on the increase in muscle contraction time and the consequent excessive recruitment of the antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical lesion study and intraoperative epidural recordings were made to test the origin and clinical significance of the spinal N13 and P13 of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) that follow median nerve stimulation. Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity. On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor. The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13. Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome. This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn. Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage.\r"

  ".U": "91108485\r", 
  ".W": "Different physiological mechanisms of facilitation of latencies and amplitudes of magnetic motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were evaluated in a cohort of 140 healthy volunteers. The potentials were induced at the vertex and recorded at the abductor pollicis brevis. The aim of the present investigation was to compare physiological mechanisms which presumably facilitate motor pathways at the cortical level with those known to occur during contraction of small hand muscles. When compared with MEPs at rest, the maximum average decrease of latencies (1.5, SD 1.1 ms) as well as the highest increase of peak to peak amplitudes (2.6, SD 2.1 mV) was observed during exertion of a voluntary background force, at the muscle recorded from. Pre-innervation of a neighbouring muscle (abductor digiti minimi) led to a lesser average decrease of latencies by 1.0, SD 1.1 ms and an average increase of amplitudes by only 0.5, SD 1.5 mV. Non-specific manoeuvres, like sticking out the tongue or counting aloud, reduced mean latencies slightly by 0.4 ms, SD 0.8 ms and 0.3 SD 0.85 ms respectively, but increased amplitudes markedly by an average of 1.0, SD 1.6 mV and 0.8, SD 1.4 mV respectively. It is concluded that facilitation of MEPs by non-specific manoeuvres occurs and must be taken into account when evaluating MEPs.\r"

Four patients had evidence of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) both on clinical testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these four patients, atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem became visible at the same time and progressed in a roughly parallel manner, whereas in the remaining two the brain stem was left intact. In all patients with OPCA, definite brain-stem atrophy was visible earlier than the appearance of non-cerebellar clinical symptoms. The present data suggest that CT investigations at regular intervals may be of prognostic value in cerebellar ataxias.\r"

The briskness of the tendon reflexes in arms and legs was scored on a nine-point scale. In 28% of the 160 examined reflexes the observations disagreed 2 scale units or more. Disagreement on the presence of asymmetry occurred in 45% of the 80 reflex pairs. In 15% one observer judged a reflex pair to be symmetrical while another observer found asymmetry of at least 2 scale units. In a second experiment clinical observation of apparently asymmetrical quadriceps reflexes was compared with measurement by surface electromyography. A significant, semi-logarithmic relationship was found between clinical scores and measured reflex amplitudes. Measured reflex asymmetry always agreed with clinical asymmetry, and the magnitudes of right-left amplitude differences were correlated with the magnitude of clinically observed asymmetry. The bedside examination of tendon reflexes is subject to considerable inter-observer disagreement.\r"

CT and MRI revealed bilateral post-ischaemic lesions in the dorsomedial thalamus and the mesodiencephalic junction, dorsomedial to the red nucleus, thus being restricted to the territory of the posterior thalamosubthalamic paramedian artery, which includes the region of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle as the main premotor nucleus for the generation of vertical saccades. In our patients, oculographic examination with electro-oculography and magnetic search coil recording showed severe impairment of downward more than upward saccades and only minor deficits of vertical pursuit and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Visual functions were normal, with one exception: a psychophysical test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical movements. This could be due to a central adaptive mechanism which, in order to minimize oscillopsia, might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze palsy. As an alternative explanation, lesions within the midbrain tegmentum could have damaged subcortical visual pathways involved in motion perception.\r"

In the second patient only the mamillary bodies were involved. Besides Wernicke's encephalopathy, a primary cerebral immunoblastoma and cerebral toxoplasmosis were found in the first patient, whereas the second showed severe encephalitis with numerous microglial and multinucleated giant cells reacting positively with anti-HIV antibody. Just as in the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy in malignant diseases, the catabolic trend of the metabolism of the immunodeficient patients with consecutive thiamine deficiency must be considered the principal pathogenetic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Preclinical evaluation has suggested impressive concentration-dependent cytotoxic synergy between cisplatin and cytarabine in ovarian carcinoma. To further evaluate the clinical relevance of these observations, 39 patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian carcinoma were entered onto a phase II trial of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (100 to 105 mg/m2 per course) plus cytarabine (600 to 900 mg per course). Treatment was administered over 2 or 3 days for a maximum of five monthly courses, followed by surgical reevaluation in patients without clinical evidence of disease. The 3-day regimen was discontinued secondary to the development of severe thrombocytopenia (five of 12 courses platelets decreased to less than 50,000/mm3). Additional toxicities included abdominal pain (moderate to severe at some time during therapy in 46% of patients), fever without evidence of infection (44%), and bacterial peritonitis (10%). Three patients declined surgical reassessment. Fourteen of 36 (39%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 55%) assessable patients demonstrated surgically defined responses, including 12 of 23 (52%; 95% CI, 32% to 72%) patients with tumor nodules less than 1 cm in diameter and only two of 13 (15%; 95% CI, 0% to 34%) patients with any lesion greater than 1 cm. There were seven (30%; 95% CI, 11% to 49%) surgically defined complete responses (CRs) in patients with less than 1 cm disease and none in patients with larger tumor nodules. IP cisplatin/cytarabine results in a high surgically defined response rate in patients with minimal residual ovarian carcinoma, but activity is low in patients with bulky intraabdominal disease.\r"
