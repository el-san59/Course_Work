  ".W": "Electrophysiological characteristics of monopolar low constant current stimulation, and evoked facial muscle responses to such stimulation, were evaluated in 34 cases of acoustic neurinoma. Our study, using stimulus parameters of 0.1-ms-duration pulse wave with 0.5-0.6 mA intensity, revealed that extent of spreading current depends on the current intensity, being about 1 mm from the electrode with 0.5-0.6 mA, and insulation of the electrode prevented the current from spreading through the cerebrospinal fluid, giving a reliable amount of current to the tissue. Evoked facial muscle responses to facial nerve stimulation in the internal auditory meatus and over the pons were analyzed and revealed the following: (1) The responses to stimulation in the internal auditory meatus showed no amplitude attenuation throughout the operation. (2) The responses to stimulation over the pons gradually decreased in amplitude as tumor dissection from the nerve proceeded, especially in large tumors. (3) Anatomical continuity of the nerve was obtained in 100% of small, 91.7% of medium, and 88.2% of large tumors. Our data show that monopolar low constant current stimulation is effective in obtaining the precise anatomical orientation of the facial nerve during tumor removal.\r"

Operation revealed that both patients had many small defects of the dura mater and the bone in the middle cranial fossa, which were plugged by necrotic brain tissue. These defects were remote from the sites of the original tumors but may have been produced by long-standing raised intracranial pressure, and they presumably allowed air to enter after intracranial pressure was reduced by shunting. Repair of the defects prevented further intracranial air retention.\r"

Three other animals treated with normal saline served as controls. All agents were introduced through an isolated cortical artery. Estrogen-alcohol induced immediate occlusion of small vessels (less than 20 microns), and then progressive obstruction of larger ones (200-300 microns) within several days. Animals treated with PVac showed vascular obliteration (greater than 100 microns) and moderate chronic fibrosis. The effects of embolization using E-A followed by PVac were found to have the combined advantages of both materials, showing diffuse occlusion of the vascular network with less tissue reaction. Hyalinization of embolized vessels with extensive fibrosis occurred afterward. For 6 weeks there was no evidence of recanalization or foreign body giant cell reaction. This study shows that E-A and PVac are capable of producing vascular occlusions with only mild tissue reaction. Because they are easily controllable and have no adverse effects, they may be suitable for intravascular application in the central nervous system.\r"

Workup revealed bitemporal hemianopia, a markedly enlarged pituitary gland on computed tomography scan, and biochemical evidence of partial hypopituitarism. At surgery, a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland was taken revealing lymphocytic hypophysitis. The patient was treated with steroids and replacement doses of thyroid hormone. Visual fields improved postoperatively. A repeat computed tomography scan obtained 2 months after an uneventful pregnancy showed that her pituitary had regained normal size and contour. Over the next 9 months she had gradual recovery of all pituitary function. This case allowed us to follow and document the course of lymphocytic hypophysitis from its presentation as a macroadenoma with partial hypopituitarism to full recovery of both size and hormonal function of the pituitary. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass or pituitary dysfunction presenting in pregnancy. In patients with suspected lymphocytic hypophysitis and a pituitary mass, a trial of steroids may be therapeutic.\r"

  ".W": "We report two right-handed patients who underwent resection of intrinsic glial tumors from the nondominant hemisphere, face motor cortex. Both patients underwent preoperative assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localizing the tumor in the inferior region of the Rolandic cortex. With the patients under general anesthesia and without muscular paralysis, the tumor volume was determined by intraoperative ultrasound and resective surgery accomplished with the aid of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping techniques. Radical resection of the tumor from the face motor cortex was achieved in both patients. A transient contralateral facial weakness and apraxia were noted in each patient, and this resolved within 6 to 8 weeks following surgery. Removal of intrinsic tumors involving the nondominant face motor cortex may be safely achieved using brain mapping techniques to localize inferior Rolandic cortex and avoid resection of the hand motor cortex and descending subcortical motor pathways. Permanent disability will be prevented due to the bilateral representation of face motor function at the neocortical level. However, due to language localization in cortical zones contiguous with the dominant hemisphere, face motor cortex, we do not recommend resection of this region.\r"

The observed trends of decreased LVEF, and echo Doppler evidence of a trend toward LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, although not individually statistically significant, represent 3 separate evaluation techniques coupled with hypertension and TPRI increase during administration of rHuEPO to increase the hematocrit and packed red blood cell volume in patients with chronic renal failure and anemia. Increased TPRI and hypertension associated with correction of uremic anemia vasodilation and the increased blood viscosity have been noted in earlier investigations with transfusions. The hypertension and elevated TPRI demonstrated during rHuEPO therapy in patients with progressive chronic renal failure associated with increased hematocrit, and the trends toward systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction are noted herein. These changes were associated with the combined increase of packed RBC mass and plasma volume in this study. The natural progressive course of worsening of renal function exhibited by these patients could have limited their ability to regulate plasma volume, making them vulnerable to volume-dependent hypertension and a significant preload adding to potential cardiac dysfunction in addition to the increased TPRI.\r"

During an 8 1/2-year period, 335 vascular access procedures were performed, 108 of which were antecubital brachiocephalic Gore-Tex conduits. Of these Gore-Tex conduits, 1.8% (2/108) had developed symptoms of vascular insufficiency 2 to 3 1/2 months after such access surgery. As previously published, arterial steal after the creation of an AV fistula could be corrected by the placement of an interposition Gore-Tex loop that would cure the problem and save the access. We have presented a procedure to correct a steal syndrome once a Gore-Tex conduit is already in place. Proximal banding and distal ligation with division of the cephalic vein below an end-to-side Gore-Tex loop is a simple surgical solution. It is not only curative but the procedure also maintains the existing Gore-Tex graft as a sustained avenue for access.\r"

Screening for dementia in persons aged 75 years and older would therefore identify a significant number of impaired persons. When screening for dementia, group testing would be more cost-effective than individual testing. We modified the Folstein Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) for screening in a group setting. Community volunteers were tested at a geriatric health fair and at a special exercise class for the elderly. Subjects were subsequently tested individually using the standard Folstein MMSE. Analysis using Pearson correlation and a paired t-test indicates a high degree of concurrent validity between the two methods of administering the MMSE. This pilot study suggests that when screening elderly persons for dementia, a group-administered instrument can be a useful method to obtain a preliminary sample of cognitively impaired individuals.\r"

A retrospective chart review at the University of South Alabama Family Practice Center was undertaken to assess changes in physician prescribing and testing patterns since the advent of rapid testing of streptococcal pharyngitis (rapid strep tests [RST]). Charts for study were identified by encounter form coding of a diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis or pharyngitis not otherwise specified. Control and test groups were formed based on the availability of the RST, and a stratified sample was drawn from each group. In the group of patients studied after the RST became available, data analysis showed a significantly increased likelihood that patients received antibiotics with a positive RST (odds ratio [OR] = 6.42), whereas those patients with a negative or no RST were significantly less likely to receive antibiotics (OR = 2.50 and 2.48, respectively). Group assignment was a significant predictor of test-ordering behavior (P less than 0.05). A higher than expected rate of streptococcal pharyngitis was noted in the group of patients who had the RST available to them. The RST plays an important though not fully defined role in the current management of pharyngitis.\r"

This article describes the 5-year evolution of a physician-support group that has provided supervision and psychodynamic insight. The key elements of the group's effectiveness are leadership, connecting work issues to personal dynamics, defusing defenses, and ensuring confidentiality. Competitiveness, mistakes, anger, difficult patients, death, fear of malpractice, and family-work tensions are issues that have been addressed. Psychodynamic supervision groups differ from peer-support groups and therapy groups. Psychodynamic supervision in support groups, as used in the supervision and training of pastoral counselors, offers a simple and powerful means to ease the burdens of medical practice and thus prevents disillusionment and subsequent impairment among physicians.\r"

Inhibin is a gonadal hormone that specifically inhibits pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone. Before it was finally isolated in 1985, inhibin was expected to be an ideal contraceptive. Recent research, however, has shown that the inhibin hormonal system is unexpectedly complex, and hopes for clinical use of inhibin must be suspended for the present. Although oral contraception is one of the most effective methods ever devised, use is limited by adverse effects of estrogen (or fears of such effects). A system known as brain-enhanced estrogen delivery specifically delivers estrogen to the brain, including the hypothalamus, there inducing suppression of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone. It has been described and tested in animals, and its successful development could replace current oral contraceptives and extend their availability to many more women.\r"

Several reports, however, suggest that generic levothyroxine may not always be interchangeable with the proprietary preparations. Such interchangeability is critical because patients are likely to receive different brands of levothyroxine during the life of their treatment. We report a case of severe hypothyroidism that developed in a patient who had been well controlled before receiving a generic levothyroxine preparation. Analysis of the patient's tablet by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed that the levothyroxine content was approximately 30 percent less than its labeled content and outside current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. It is likely that poor tablet bioavailability was a contributory factor. Euthyroidism was achieved with the same dose of a more potent and possibly more bioavailable brand-name product. Until levothyroxine products become more uniform and the FDA confers therapeutic equivalence, product substitution with expense as the principal consideration should be avoided.\r"

This causes a reduction in myocardial contractility or a fall in vascular resistance because of a lowering of vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the net effect is a fall in blood pressure. The three major classes of calcium antagonists, the dihydropyridines, papaverine derivatives, and benzothiazepines, differ in molecular structure and their binding characteristics to the calcium channels. Furthermore, newer antagonists, particularly the dihydropyridines such as nicardipine, have a high affinity for vascular tissue and are highly selective for vascular smooth muscle. These compounds also have a favorable effect on hypertension mainly because of lowering of vascular resistance. In addition, they do not cause potentially negative metabolic effects on glucose or lipid levels and are generally well tolerated. Based on these findings, the Joint National Committee in the United States and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Committee on the Management of Mild Hypertension recommended the use of calcium antagonists as first-line treatment in hypertension.\r"

The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression.\r"

This is particularly true in small resistance arteries, but larger vessels are also affected. The precise mechanisms remain to be determined, although it is highly likely that growth-promoting autacoids are involved as well as mechanical forces. Numerous studies of hypertension in animal models and a few in hypertensive humans have tried to establish the reversibility of these changes after successful lowering of blood pressure. Too few data are available to form firm conclusions, but thiazides and hydralazine-like vasodilators appear to have only a minimal effect on the vasculature. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly effective, and alpha-blockers may be active. However, it is difficult to derive even tentative conclusions from the available information on calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. These results are discussed in the context of future therapeutic and investigative approaches.\r"

Blood pressure, heart weight, heart/body weight ratio, the area occupied by the medial layer, and area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in SHRs compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Nicardipine reduced blood pressure, as well as relative heart weight, the area occupied by vascular smooth muscle, and the area occupied by the vascular wall/area of lumen ratio. In addition, the size of laminae of smooth muscle of the pulmonary artery was reduced in nicardipine-treated SHRs; coronary artery branches were the most sensitive. The results of the study provide direct evidence that nicardipine reduces not only blood pressure but is also able to counteract the development of hypertension-dependent changes in the morphology of the cardiovascular system.\r"

During the past 10 years this hypothesis has been tested in clinical studies. It has been found that subjects with hypertension consistently have raised plasma catecholamine levels and in particular elevated epinephrine levels. Arterial but not venous epinephrine concentrations correlated with plasma concentrations of the platelet-release reaction marker beta-thromboglobulin (BTG). Plasma BTG is elevated in hypertensive patients, and psychological stress (i.e., hypertension labeling) stimulates plasma epinephrine and BTG. When a physiologic dose of epinephrine is infused into essential hypertensive patients, platelet counts, platelet size, and plasma BTG concentrations increase more than in normotensive subjects. Data suggest that there is a connection between psychological stress, plasma epinephrine levels, and platelet function, especially in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The interference of intraarterial nicardipine, verapamil, and diltiazem with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine antagonized the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas verapamil was ineffective, suggesting that functional alpha-adrenergic antagonism may participate in the vasodilatory and possibly the antihypertensive effect. Nicardipine also blunted the vasoconstriction to lower-body negative pressure and the action of angiotensin II administered intraarterially. Despite a comparable increase in basal forearm flow, verapamil was less potent than nicardipine in inhibiting vasoconstriction after both stimuli. Therefore nicardipine suppressed preferentially regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium in response to receptor activation, because both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. At variance with both nicardipine and verapamil was potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine after the administration of diltiazem. Because intraarterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action and the local vasodilatation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered also with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium channel blockers in humans.\r"

The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions. Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences. It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects. Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects. Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure. Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises.\r"

  ".W": "The calcium antagonist nicardipine was administered to 42 patients at a dose of 60 or 120 mg/day for an average of 7.8 weeks to determine its effects on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Glucose tolerance and immunoreactive insulin levels were essentially unchanged by nicardipine regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased in all patients. Concentrations of triglycerides decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in association with nicardipine administration. Therefore it is concluded that, regardless of the preexisting level of glucose tolerance, nicardipine exerted hypotensive effects without significant adverse effects on glucose tolerance or insulin secretion.\r"

All drugs used in the management of hypertension, including calcium antagonists, are coming under increasing scrutiny for the possible beneficial and adverse effects they may have on the circulation and risk factor profile. This is particularly because of concern about the relative resistance of coronary heart disease to antihypertensive drug treatment and the increasing interest in evaluating the impact of blood pressure-lowering drugs on surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity of calcium antagonists, it may be wise to keep in mind the subtypes as exemplified by the prototypes nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil and to extrapolate from one type to another with great caution. The increased understanding of the diversity among calcium antagonists as well as the pathophysiology of hypertension and other vascular diseases promises an exciting future for calcium antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics.\r"

Direct observation or weighed food records are useful primarily as validation for less intrusive methods. Complete food history by interview or food diary (by self report) is expensive and time consuming. A 24-h diet recall obtained by a trained dietitian can provide accurate, quantitative information on recent intake but does not represent usual intake. Food frequency questionnaires provide better estimates of usual diet but are less quantitative and subject to problems of recall and seasonality. No method is universally the best. Lack of an expected diet-disease association may reflect exposure misclassification, inadequate statistical power, or limited range of the nutrients studied. Given the differences in diet-assessment methods, studies of dietary calcium and osteoporotic fracture have had surprisingly similar results.\r"

This assertion was based on the decreasing gradient of mortality rates from north to south, suggesting a mechanism related to a favorable influence of ultraviolet-induced vitamin D metabolites on metabolism of calcium. A 19-y prospective study of 1954 Chicago men found that a dietary intake of greater than 3.75 micrograms vitamin D/d was associated with a 50% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer, whereas an intake of greater than or equal to 1200 mg Ca/d was associated with a 75% reduction. Clinical and laboratory studies further support these findings. A nested case-control study based on serum drawn from a cohort of 25,620 individuals reported that moderately elevated concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the range 65-100 nmol/L, were associated with large reductions (P less than 0.05) in the incidence of colorectal cancer.\r"

Although various theories account for possible mechanisms, it is clear that under the influence of a basic colonic pH, fatty acids and bile acids may become highly surfactant in the colon, causing cell loss and compensatory hyperproliferation. Calcium likely reduces lipid damage in the colon by complexing with fat to form mineral-fat complexes or soaps. It has been shown in an increasing number of animal experiments that calcium has the ability to inhibit colon cancer. In limited studies in man, the colonic hyperproliferation associated with increased risk for colon cancer has been reversed for short periods by administration of supplemental dietary calcium. Taken together the available evidence suggests that increases in the daily intake of calcium in the diet may provide a means of colorectal-cancer control.\r"

Our earlier experiments indicated that yields of tumors induced in young, Sprague-Dawley rats by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were higher when dietary calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were decreased. Results of an experiment in which dietary amounts of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were varied independently suggested that phosphate and vitamin D have interactive effects with calcium. Another experiment in which dietary vitamin D alone was varied provided evidence that higher amounts inhibited tumorigenesis in the presence of low amounts of calcium and phosphate but the results with a high-calcium and -phosphate diet were inconclusive. The findings suggest that low amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D and high amounts of phosphate increase susceptibility to DMBA-induced mammary neoplasia.\r"

In this study the effect of raising calcium alone to near the median level (0.22 mg/kcal) and to a high level (1.3 mg/kcal), comparable to adult human dietary intake, was tested in mice and rats while retaining the three other high-risk components.

These findings also indicate that there is a threshold of the potential protective effect of adequate calcium intake, below which the risk of hypertension increases at a greater rate. The set point of this threshold, estimated at 700-800 mg/d, may be modified by a variety of factors including dietary patterns and components, lifestyle, and genetics. This may explain, at least in part, the heterogeneous response observed in dietary-intervention studies. In animal models of hypertension it was shown that greater amounts of calcium must be given to cause a blood pressure change comparable with that in normal animals, suggesting that in high-risk human populations in which calcium metabolism may be disordered, calcium intake may have to be increased to amounts greater than 700-800 mg/d to demonstrate the blood-pressure-lowering effect. Calcium intake at or above the currently recommended daily allowance of 800 mg could be of potential benefit to certain racial groups, individuals ingesting excessive alcohol, and pregnant women, all of whom generally consume low amounts of calcium and who are at higher risk of developing hypertension.\r"

PHF, which has been reported in plasma of humans with essential hypertension and spontaneously hypertensive rats, has both pressor and calciotropic actions. Calcitonin is without vascular effects and CGRP is a potent vasodilator. It is concluded that several of the hormones responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis modulate vascular Ca2+ metabolism and force generating capacity.

SHR-S and control WKY rats were begun on one of four diets at age 8 wk: control, high NaCl, high Ca2+, or high NaCl and high Ca2+. In SHR-S, dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevented the NaCl-induced increases in blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentrations, the reductions in anterior hypothalamic norepinephrine stores and turnover, and the secondary increases in alpha 2 adrenoceptor number. Thus, Ca2+ prevented NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S by increasing noradrenergic input to the anterior hypothalamus. High-NaCl-fed SHR-S had impaired diuretic and natriuretic responses to an isotonic volume load; Ca2+ enhanced the ability of these animals to adjust fluid volume rapidly via diuresis and natriuresis. This alteration in renal function may contribute to the hypotensive effect of a high Ca2+ diet in NaCl-sensitive hypertension.\r"

Additionally, the effect of calcium on blood pressure may influence the incidence and/or gestational age of development of preeclampsia. Additionally, the effect on smooth-muscle relaxation detected in calcium-supplemented patients may affect the incidence of prematurity. Although the mechanism for these effects has not been entirely elucidated, calcium supplementation appears to affect circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone and renin, which may modulate intracellular ionized calcium, resulting in the observed effect on smooth-muscle relaxation. This effect may also be responsible for reduced uterine activity and for a lowering of the incidence of prematurity.\r"

In contrast, the spine is unresponsive to supplementation with calcium even at higher doses in early postmenopausal women.

Loss from the spine can be retarded by increasing calcium intake to the current recommended dietary allowance in older women with low usual calcium diets.

Also nuclei from one of two lung carcinomas, a papillary thyroid carcinoma, an ovarian fibroma, and a lymphoma were strongly reactive. One leiomyosarcoma and a dermoid cyst were negative. Although 1 benign breast with duct hyperplasia showed moderate reactivity, only 1 of 10 benign breast biopsies without hyperplasia showed reactivity. Three of 4 skin biopsies, 2 liver biopsies, 6 of 9 kidney biopsies, and 5 of 10 gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies showed reactivity in benign nuclei. It is concluded that, although breast carcinoma nuclei showed the most consistent reactivity for NM-200.4, both benign and malignant nuclei from other body sites also show reactivity.\r"

Subsequent in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA showed IL-1 transcripts in macrophages predominantly but not in T cells or B cells. Neither fibroblasts nor keratinocytes contained the IL-1 message to any significant extent. Endothelial cells also were essentially negative for IL-1 messages. These findings indicate that IL-1 is produced principally by macrophages in inflamed gingival tissues of humans.\r"

Eosinophils are present in healing wounds and have recently been shown to be capable of producing TGF-alpha. This investigation was done to determine if eosinophils infiltrated into healing wounds are capable of expressing this cytokine. Using the rabbit cutaneous open wound model, the study found that the eosinophil is one of the predominant cell types in the healing wound, beginning from the seventh day and thereafter. Most surprisingly, the majority of the eosinophils present in the healing wound were found to contain TGF-alpha mRNA and protein by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Thus it is proposed that the delivery of TGF-alpha by eosinophils to epithelial wound healing sites represents a normal body mechanism whereby this multifunctional cytokine can accelerate the wound healing process.\r"

In addition, treatment of ECs with IL-4 resulted in the synthesis and secretion of MCP-1/JE protein. While IL-4 did not significantly influence the induced expression of MCP-1/JE mRNA by interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor, concomitant treatment with IL-4 and IL-1 caused more secretion of MCP-1/JE protein than either cytokine alone. These results suggest that EC-produced MCP-1/JE may mediate some of IL-4's effects on monocyte physiology in vivo, including IL-4's anti-tumor properties.\r"

Transgenic mice heritably developing endocrine tumors of the pancreas (AVP/SV40, Rip 1 Tag2/Rip2PyST1 and Glu2-Tag strains) were used as murine models of islet cells proliferative disease. In the mouse, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in B cells at embryonic day 12 (E12), paralleling the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In hyperplastic/dysplastic islets and in B-cell tumors of transgenic mice (n = 16), IAPP immunoreactivity was localized consistently to insulin-immunoreactive cells. Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules. In human fetuses, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in insulin-immunoreactive B cells, but at a later gestational age than the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In pancreatic specimens of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (11 cases) and in pancreatic endocrine tumors (21 cases, 10 of which were functioning insulinomas), IAPP immunoreactivity was found consistently in insulin-immunoreactive B cells. Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits present in tumors also were IAPP immunoreactive. Ultrastructural single and double immunogold labeling of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases (n = 3) and functioning insulinomas (n = 2) showed IAPP and insulin to be colocalized in beta granules. In addition, IAPP immunoreactivity was observed in amyloidlike fibrils. These findings indicate that IAPP is a constitutive component of B cells. Possible relationships between IAPP and insulin expression and interspecies differences are suggested and discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The structure and function of the tumor microvasculature is of great interest for cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapy. The distribution of endothelial cells, pericytes, and basal lamina in tumors is not well documented. In this study, the authors investigated the distribution of markers for these different components in a series of malignant human tumors and in human granulation tissue, both situations with extensive angiogenesis. Their results show a striking heterogeneity in the expression of markers for pericytes and endothelial cells between different tumors, but also within a single tumor lesion. To be able to distinguish between these two adjacent cell types decisively, all marker studies were carried out both on the light and the electron microscopical level and compared with staining results in granulation tissue of cutaneous wounds in healthy volunteers and of decubitus lesions. In granulation tissue of decubitus lesions, well-defined zones with increasing levels of maturation can be delineated. It was found that antibodies recognizing von Willebrand factor often failed to stain the tumor capillaries. Of the pericyte markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin was only locally expressed by pericytes in the tumor vasculature, whereas the high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, stained the microvasculature broadly. Staining of the basal lamina components collagen type IV and laminin was, within the tumor, not restricted to the microvasculature. From their findings the authors conclude that 1) for the visualization of the tumor vasculature, antibodies recognizing endothelial markers, especially monoclonal antibodies PAL-E and BMA 120, are preferable to those recognizing pericytes or basal lamina; 2) within the microvasculature of tumors and granulation tissue, a heterogeneity of expression of endothelial and pericyte markers is observed; 3) during the formation of granulation tissue, all three microvascular components can be demonstrated already in the histologically earliest stage, suggesting not only an involvement of endothelial cells but also of pericytes and basal lamina in the initial steps of angiogenesis in wound healing.\r"

Total collagen synthesis in cultured mesangial and arterial smooth muscle cells was lower than in venous smooth muscle cells. Electrophoretic analysis showed type I collagen predominated in all cell types, although levels were highest in mesangial and arterial smooth muscle cells. Collagen V (alpha 3) occurred only in venous smooth muscle cells. Mesangial and arterial smooth muscle cells showed cellbound fibronectin and laminin, which also were secreted into the medium. Venous smooth muscle cells secreted fibronectin, but all laminin was cell bound. The findings suggest a strong similarity between mesangial and arterial smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".U": "91273111\r", 
  ".W": "The anaphylatoxin C3a (125I-HC3a) is extensively degraded when exposed to isolated rat mast cells (RMC). Degradation occurs without prior stimulation of these cells. The protease responsible for C3a degradation has been identified as chymase. Mixed peritoneal cells, containing equal numbers of mast cells compared with incubates containing more highly purified RMC, promoted less degradation of the C3a molecule than did the purified RMC. These variable levels of spontaneous activation (ie, chymase release) of RMC in vitro were concluded to be a function of the cellular handling and isolation procedures. No degradation occurred when low levels of 125I-HC3ades Arg (10(-8) mol/l [molar]) were introduced in the peritoneum of a rat, unless the mast cells were stimulated by prior introduction of specific activators. Evidence that the enzyme being released in the peritoneal cavity of rats was chymase was provided both by its appearance after adding specific mast cell activators (ie, compound 48/80 and anti-IgE [gamma E immunoglobulin]) and by inhibition with chymostatin. Because 125I-HC3ades Arg at low levels (10(-8) mol/l) was not degraded in the rat peritoneum, expression of chymase by the rat mast cells could be monitored in situ during mast cell stimulation. 125I-HC3ades Arg was rapidly converted (in 2 to 5 minutes) to smaller fragments in the peritoneal cavity of the rat after either 10 micrograms of compound 48/80 or anti-IgE was injected. Introduction of higher levels of HC3a or HC3ades Arg (2.5 to 5.0 x 10(-6) mol/l) to the peritoneal cavity of the rat stimulated both chymase release and HC3a degradation without other mast cell activators being present. HC3ades Arg was equally as effective in vivo as HC3a in stimulating the rat peritoneal mast cell to release chymase. It was concluded that the mechanism of RMC activation by C3a (C3ades Arg) was nonspecific and similar to the process by which polyamines and polycations stimulate mast cells, as C3a is a highly cationic molecule. The fact that C3a may in turn be destroyed in minutes by the recruited protease (chymase) defines a potentially important physiologic control mechanism. This cellular control process, demonstrated here for rat mast cells, may function in other animals, including man, for regulating tissue levels of factors such as the anaphylatoxins that are potentially capable of mast cell activation through nonspecific (polycationic) mechanisms.\r"

The percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells showed great variability for both acinar (0% to 2.66%; mean, 0.70%; standard deviation [SD], 0.80%) and ductal cells (0% to 1.99%; mean, 0.51%; SD, 0.57%). The fraction of proliferating epithelial cells declined with the age of the patients and was significantly higher in premenopausal women (1.16% +/- 0.85% for acinar and 0.94% +/- 0.60% for ductal cells) as compared with the postmenopausal women (0.27% +/- 0.46% for acinar and 0.17% +/- 0.22% for ductal cells), P less than 0.01 for acinar and P less than 0.001 for ductal cells, respectively. In some patients, great variability in distribution of proliferating acinar and ductal cells among different lobules and ducts was observed. No difference was found in the number of proliferating acinar and ductal cells situated near or far from their corresponding tumors. No correlation was seen between cell proliferation of normal acinar or ductal cells and cell proliferation of the respective tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Scurfy (sf) is a spontaneous, sex-linked, recessive mutation that maps to the extreme proximal portion of the X chromosome, about 2 centimorgans from sparse fur (spf). Hemizygotes for sf manifest several clinical disorders, evident at 14 days of age, including scaliness and crusting of the eyelids, ears, and tail, runting, reddening and swelling of the genital papilla, anemia, cachexia, and early death (average, 24 days). Our studies indicate that the phenotype of hemizygous scurfy is not, as has been suggested, a model for human X-linked ichthyosis, but appears to be a disease primarily affecting the lymphoreticular, and possibly the hematopoietic, systems. Gross lesions include marked splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes, and variable thickening of the ears. The characteristic histologic lesion is a lymphohistiocytic proliferation and infiltration of peripheral lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and skin. In routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, these lesions efface lymph node architecture, thicken the dermis, and form nodular portal infiltrates in the liver. Scurfy lesions characteristically contain a population of large blastlike cells with round to oval nuclei, a vesicular chromatin pattern, and prominent single nucleoli. Mixed perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes sometimes are found in kidney, heart, pancreas, lung, and mesenteries. There is excessive hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen. Cells expressing B220 or Thy-1 antigens localize to appropriate areas in the lymph nodes and spleen, but are rare in the portal infiltrates and are absent from the skin. There is a marked, polyclonal increase in serum IgG, severe Coombs'-positive anemia, and leukocytosis with atypical mononuclear cells. Scurfy mice are negative for antinuclear antibodies. Despite their morphologically aberrant lymphoreticular system, scurfy mice can exist in a conventional environment without evidence of opportunistic infection. Raising scurfy mice in a specific-pathogen-free environment does not alter disease expression. Thus, while our findings indicate that scurfy disease may be the result of immune dysfunction, it is not a classic immunodeficiency.\r"

The patient's course was complicated by severe respiratory, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system dysfunctions, which were believed to be primarily the results of his Legionella infection. Aggressive antibiotic treatment produced no response, and Legionella remained isolatable from lung tissue throughout several weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Human herpesvirus 6 was isolated from a sample of peripheral blood during the acute stage of the patient's illness, and numerous HHV-6--infected macrophages and lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy-derived lung tissue. Paradoxically treatment of the patient with high-dose corticosteroids resulted in dramatic improvement of his condition, including clearance of the Legionella infection. The demonstration that corticosteroids efficiently inhibit HHV-6 replication in vitro suggests that the virus may have contributed to the patient's pneumonitis by enhancing tissue inflammation, by compromising the function of pulmonary macrophages, and, perhaps, by destroying the patient's CD4+ T lymphocytes. Human herpesvirus 6 may be able to function as a synergistic cofactor in lung infections by Legionella and other pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "Wound healing and tumor stroma generation share several important properties, including hyperpermeable blood vessels, extravasation of fibrinogen, and extravascular clotting. In both, the deposits of fibrin gel serve initially as provisional stroma and later are replaced by granulation tissue. Proteoglycans (PG) are also important constituents of the extracellular matrix, but their composition and role in healing wounds and tumor stroma generation are poorly understood. The authors used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods to investigate the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DSPG) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) composition of healing skin wounds and solid tumors. By immunohistochemistry, the great majority of normal guinea pig and human dermis stained weakly for CSPG and strongly for decorin. In contrast, the granulation tissue of healing skin wounds and scars stained intensely for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin; however decorin staining was restored to normal intensity after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase, suggesting that decorin antigenic sites had been masked by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Like wounds, the stroma of several carcinomas (line 1 guinea pig, human breast, colon, basal cell, and squamous) stained strongly for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin, but decorin staining developed after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. Thus healing wounds and tumor stroma express a common pattern of altered PG staining, adding another to the properties these pathologic entities share. Proteoglycans extracted from healing wounds after in situ labelling with [35S] Na sulfate contained more CSPG than normal dermis with significantly longer GAG chains. Granulation tissue also synthesized more DSPG than normal skin, with greater heterogeneity and longer GAG chains. These alterations in PG synthesis correlate with the cell proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis that accompany wound healing and may provide clues to the mechanisms responsible for both wound healing and tumor stroma generation.\r"

The monoclonal antibodies (MAb) used were specific for all known CD45 epitopes, including the seven different CD45 common epitopes as well as the four known CD45R epitopes (two CD45RA, one CD45RB, and one CD45RO). Dendritic cells in all sites were uniformly reactive for the CD45 common epitopes tested except 2B11, which may recognize a CD45R rather than CD45 epitope. By single-label immunoperoxidase and double-label immunofluorescence epitope mapping of CD1a+ dendritic cells in tissue sections, it was generally difficult or impossible to detect expression of CD45RA, CD45RB, CD45RO, or 2B11. In blood dendritic cells, however, low levels of these CD45R epitopes were detected consistently using single-label immunoperoxidase staining of cytocentrifuge preparations. Monocytes were similar to blood dendritic cells except that the staining with MAb to CD45RO and 2B11 was slightly stronger. The authors conclude that dendritic cells differ from most subpopulations of lymphocytes in that CD45 common epitopes are readily detectable but the existing RA, RB, and RO epitopes are either undetectable or expressed at relatively low levels. These studies raise the possibility that CD1a+ dendritic cells may express a novel dominant CD45 isoform.\r"

  ".W": "The highly restricted expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in malignancy has limited the use of EBV detection methods applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. In EBV-transformed lymphocytes very short nonprotein coding EBV transcripts (EBERs) are expressed in much higher abundance (10(7) copies per cell) than other EBV latency transcripts. Using a 3H riboprobe, the authors demonstrated EBER1 expression in NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMAS (NPCs) as well as in parotid salivary gland. Recognition of EBER1 expression was facilitated by the intensity of hybridization and its characteristic morphology (nuclear with nucleolar sparing). EBER1 expression was not demonstrated in other epithelial malignancies arising from mucosal surfaces (oropharynx, uterine cervix) from which EBV shedding has been detected. Repeat study of the NPC specimens with digoxigenin-labeled probe yielded hybridization signal with subcellular morphologic detail and without background in a 12-hour procedure. Thus the EBER1 transcript is an appropriate target for in situ hybridization detection of EBV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens.\r"

  ".W": "The immunohistochemical detection of PCNA/Cyclin, a nuclear protein associated with cell proliferation, represents a potentially useful tool for the study of tumor proliferative activity. Previous studies investigating the reactivity of anti-PCNA/Cyclin monoclonal antibody 19A2 have not clearly defined the population of proliferating cells with which 19A2 reacts in tissue sections. The authors describe a method for detection of PCNA/Cyclin in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a routine biotin-streptavidin immunohistochemical system that employs an anti-IgM, mu-chain-specific second-stage antibody. The authors used this method to study the proliferative activity of 24 malignant lymphomas, consisting of 12 low-grade lymphomas (LGLs) and 12 intermediate-grade lymphomas (IGLs), and five reactive tonsils. 19A2 data was compared with Ki-67 labeling in frozen sections in the same group of cases. 19A2 provided easily detectable nuclear staining of proliferating cells with reactive cells demonstrating varying intensity of staining, this latter finding most likely due to the varying nuclear concentration of PCNA/Cyclin protein during the cell cycle. In tonsils, 19A2 reacted with germinal center cells and basal keratinocytes. In the malignant lymphomas, there was good correlation between 19A2 and Ki-67 data (r = 0.90, P less than 0.001). The subgroup of LGLs showed a mean PCNA/Cyclin of 26% and a mean Ki-67 of 28%. In the subgroup of IGLs, mean PCNA/Cyclin = 54% and mean Ki-67 = 59%. These results indicate that 19A2 detects a fraction of proliferating cells that is similar to that detected by Ki-67, ie, the growth fraction, and that 19A2 is a reliable marker of proliferative activity in uniformly handled, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Endotoxin (LPS), one of the major proinflammatory constituents of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, induces alveolar macrophages to express interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) messenger RNA (mRNA), peaking at 1 hour in vitro. Intratracheal injection of LPS induces IL-1 and TNF mRNA expression in vivo in whole-lung RNA preparations. Interleukin-1 mRNA is not constitutively detected. In the case of TNF, however, a constitutively-expressed hybridization band is noted at 1.6 kb, whereas the LPS-induced hybridization band is noted at approximately 1.95 kb. Intratracheal injection of LPS induces an intra-alveolar inflammatory reaction composed of a neutrophilic exudate, peaking at 6 to 12 hours, a monocytic exudate peaking at 24 hours, and a lymphocytic exudate peaking at 48 hours, as quantitated by bronchoalveolar lavage. Intratracheal injection of IL-1 recapitulates the kinetics and relative magnitudes of the acute neutrophilic and chronic monocytic and lymphocytic inflammatory sequence. Intratracheal injection of TNF also induces an acute intraalveolar neutrophilic exudate, but TNF is much less potent of an inflammatory stimulus than IL-1. The effects of recombinant IL-1 and TNF are not due to LPS contamination, as shown by abrogation of the cytokines' inflammatory activity by boiling. In conclusion, LPS induces IL-1 and TNF mRNA expression in vitro in alveolar macrophages and in vivo in pulmonary tissue, and intratracheal injection of IL-1 and TNF recapitulates the LPS-induced pulmonary inflammatory sequence, strongly supporting the hypothesis that these cytokines play an important in vivo role in the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacterial pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "In skeletal muscles of young mdx female heterozygote mice, there is a mosaic of dystrophin-positive and dystrophin-negative fiber segments. In older animals, there is a marked decline in the number of dystrophin-negative fiber segments. This phenomenon might be due to a fusion of dystrophin-competent satellite cells into the originally dystrophin-negative fiber segments during growth. To study this possibility, soleus muscles of 10-day-old mdx female heterozygotes were gamma irradiated (2000 rads) to inhibit subsequent myosatellite cell proliferation and fusion. In the irradiated soleus muscles of animals at 60 days, the relative amount of dystrophin measured by quantitative immunoblots was not significantly different from that of the contralateral nonirradiated muscles. The prevalence of dystrophin-negative fibers in the 60-day-old irradiated solei was not higher than in the nonirradiated contralateral muscles, implying that dystrophin-competent satellite cell fusion was not a significant factor in the observed conversion. A longitudinal expansion of the cytoplasmic domain of the original dystrophin-competent myonuclei during growth could explain the observed conversion phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that the selective melanocyte destruction in hair bulbs of the murine model for vitiligo (VIT) is instigated by either the local cutaneous environment or an innate melanocyte defect. To address this problem, the authors have isolated the melanocyte population from environmental influences by using cell culture technology and have observed reduced proliferation, specific cytologic abnormalities, and premature cell death in cultures of pure VIT melanocytes established from neonatal skin. Cultured VIT melanocytes manifest abnormal compartmentalization of melanosomes and some aberrant dihydroxyphenylalanine-positive structures. The most prominent abnormality observed in cultured VIT melanocytes when compared with the control C57BL/6J cells is a development in dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) that morphologically resembles the in vivo condition. Dilation of the RER can be exaggerated in VIT or induced in C57BL/6J melanocytes by the addition of Brefeldin A to cultures. Conversely the dilated RER cisternae characteristic of the VIT melanocyte can be reversed by inhibition of protein synthesis with cyclobeximide. Melanocyte cultures developed from heterozygote neonates, resulting from cross-breedings between the VIT and the C57BL/6J lines, also demonstrated extensive RER dilation along with only slightly reduced proliferation. The results in this report verify that the murine vitiligo melanocyte expresses an innate defect that affects the structure and presumably the function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 51 node-positive breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of neu, epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) using immunoperoxidase staining. Positive membranous staining for neu was observed in 15 (29%) tumors. Over-expression of neu was observed in high-grade, estrogen-receptor-negative tumors (P less than 0.05). Epidermal growth factor receptor was expressed in 22 (43%) of the tumors analyzed and found to a greater degree in estrogen-receptor-negative and high-grade tumors (P less than 0.025). A significant correlation between neu and EGF-R expression was also noted. Tumors expressing membranous staining of neu had a greater than 70% chance of expressing EGF-R (P less than 0.01). Expression of TGF alpha was found in 68% of tumors and TGF alpha was detected in grade 1 and 2 tumor to a greater degree than EGF-R. The authors conclude that assaying tumors for these antigens may give additional phenotypic characteristics that can give further insight into the biology of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The transport of cancer cells from blood vessels to extravascular tissue is a critical step in metastasis, where endothelial cells and the vascular basement membrane act as barriers to cell traffic. Because endothelial injury can facilitate the metastasis of intravascular cancer cells in vivo, the authors have studied in vitro the free-radical-mediated endothelial damage caused by the rat Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (W256) cell after stimulation with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) phorbol ester. Here the authors have examined the hypothesis that W256 cell-mediated endothelial injury is dependent on adhesion between the effector and target cells. Attachment of phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated W256 cells to endothelial monolayers was increased 1.8 +/- 0.1-fold and damage (3H-2-deoxyglucose release from labeled endothelium) 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold after 4-hour pretreatment of the endothelium with 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha). Under various assay conditions, the release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose correlated directly with tumor cell adhesion (r = 0.98, P less than 0.005). In the presence of a polyclonal anti-vitronectin receptor antiserum, adhesion of stimulated W256 cells to rIL-1 alpha-treated monolayers was inhibited by 39% +/- 2%, and 3H-2-deoxyglucose release was inhibited by 53% +/- 13%. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that the endothelial cells but not the W256 cells expressed vitronectin receptor (VnR) on their cell surface. The surface expression of VnR by endothelial cells was increased 1.9 +/- 0.1-fold after 4 hours' incubation with rIL-1 alpha. The authors conclude that W256 cell-mediated endothelial damage is dependent on cell adhesion, which, in turn, is partly regulated by the expression of VnR on the endothelial cell surface.\r"

METHOD: Twenty-four studies specifically addressing the issue of prodromal symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders were selected by computer search (Medline) and manual search of Index Medicus and the psychiatric literature. RESULTS: Most of the studies have described a prodromal phase in the development of mania, depression, and panic attacks. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of prodromal symptoms may precede the full syndrome by weeks or months; if these symptoms are detected, recurrences of affective disorders (bipolar illness, unipolar depression, panic disorder) could be treated earlier and perhaps more effectively. DSM-III has emphasized the traditional clinical syndromes and cross-sectional descriptions. Appraisal of prodromal and residual phases may complement this approach. The longitudinal study of prodromes, the fully developed disorder, and residual states calls for an assessment of personality, neurotic traits, and their interaction in the evolution of affective disorders.\r"

METHOD: Potential references were identified through an English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1966 to April 1990) and through extensive manual searching of textbooks and reviews. All published works with original data or hypotheses concerning bulimia in males were included. RESULTS: Bulimia affects approximately 0.2% of adolescent boys and young adult men, and males account for 10%-15% of all bulimic subjects identified in community-based studies. Compared to their female counterparts, male bulimics appear to have a later age of onset; higher prevalences of premorbid obesity, homosexuality, and asexuality; and less concern with strict weight control. These findings are discussed from biological, psychological, and cultural perspectives to develop a fuller understanding of the pathogenesis of bulimia in males. CONCLUSIONS: Bulimia in males has received relatively little attention in the literature. Future research should focus on more rigorous analytic studies that include matched comparison groups of female bulimic and male nonbulimic subjects. Such studies would not only benefit male bulimics but might provide insight into the nature of bulimia in both sexes.\r"

These changes have important implications for the practice of the profession in the future. METHOD: Each year, the APA Office of Membership, in collaboration with the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training, conducts a census of all residents in psychiatry. A survey instrument is sent to the director of residency training in each U.S. program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Using data from this survey and from the American Medical Association, the authors conducted a study of the changes in the number of psychiatric residents over the last decade, particularly the increases in the number and percentage of women in medicine and psychiatry. RESULTS: They found that the number of psychiatric residents has grown from 4,674 in academic year 1978-1979 to 5,829 in 1987-1988, an increase of 25%. The percentage of women has increased from 32% of all psychiatric residents in 1978-1979 to 41% in 1987-1988. The largest proportions of female physicians and psychiatrists were found in the age groups younger than 35. CONCLUSIONS: Previously documented gender differences that affect practice patterns and career opportunities may very well change as a function of the increasing representation of women in the profession of psychiatry, and these changes need to be taken into account in planning for future patient care and research needs.\r"

The arguments in favor of criminalization are that it serves as a deterrent, offers retribution, provides redress when other avenues are blocked, deals with unlicensed psychotherapists, makes victims' assistance funds available, and provides due process protection against false accusations. In opposition to criminalization are the arguments that civil and administrative measures already exist to deal with the problem, it may have a chilling effect on the reporting of misconduct, it may void malpractice insurance, it makes guilty psychotherapists place themselves in jeopardy if they acknowledge their wrongdoing in attempting to make amends, it removes control of the legal process from the victim, it fails to offer rehabilitation, and it singles out psychotherapists from other fiduciaries for more stringent treatment. APA district branches inevitably will be called on to take positions with regard to legislation criminalizing sexual exploitation of patients. The current public outrage over patient victimization, however appropriate it may be, appears to make it difficult to publicly justify anything other than support for criminalization.\r"

METHOD: The subjects were 29 inpatients with borderline personality disorder diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, 14 nonborderline inpatients with major depressive disorder according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, and 15 normal comparison subjects recruited from the community and screened for the absence of psychopathology. Earliest memories were used as the source of mental representations in all subjects. The memories were reliably coded for malevolent affect tone, presence of deliberate injury, and effectiveness of helpers. Family histories of childhood sexual and physical abuse were obtained with the Familial Experiences Interview, a structured interview. Abuse histories for a subset of the subjects were corroborated by interviews with family members. RESULTS: A reported history of sexual abuse, but not a reported history of physical abuse, predicted the presence of extremely malevolent representations in these earliest memories as well as representations involving deliberate injury. These two kinds of representations also discriminated borderline patients who reported histories of sexual abuse from borderline patients who did not report sexual abuse. Mean affect tone (from malevolent to benevolent) did not, however, discriminate sexually abused or physically abused subjects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that malevolent representations associated with the borderline diagnosis in previous research may be partially related to a history of childhood sexual abuse. Implications for the object relations theory of borderline personality disorder are noted.\r"

METHOD: The presence of the DSM-III and DSM-III-R criteria sets for borderline personality disorder was assessed in a study group of 253 patients with personality disorders (148 inpatients and 105 outpatients) by raters who were blind to clinical diagnoses and who used information from two semistructured interviews of proven reliability. These diagnoses were then compared with \"longitudinal expert all data\" (LEAD) standard clinical diagnoses provided by therapists specifically asked to base their diagnoses on DSM criteria. RESULTS: Both criteria sets were found to be overinclusive when compared with the LEAD standard. Most criteria were also found to lack specificity. However, the three DSM-III-R criteria that are new or revisions of DSM-III criteria were found to be more specific, and raising the cutoff on the DSM-III-R criteria from five to six improved specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Both the DSM-III and DSM-III-R criteria sets for borderline personality disorder as assessed by semistructured interview lack face validity because they are nonspecific when compared with a rigorous but representative clinical standard, and the results of studies using these criteria sets may prove misleading to researchers and clinicians because they seem to define a nonspecific type of serious character pathology.\r"

RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the respondents had, at some time, evaluated in a forensic setting a subject who exhibited behavior that met the criteria for the disorder. Four percent of the cases seen in the preceding year by those respondents who had ever seen a case would have met the criteria for the disorder. Most of the forensic psychiatrists who had experience with the disorder believed that the diagnosis is useful for a variety of clinical and forensic purposes, but most also believed that the category has significant potential for being misused in legal settings. Almost all cases described by the respondents involved male patients, and there was frequently a history of childhood abuse and parental loss. The diagnostic criteria in these cases had high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: In forensic settings the diagnosis of sadistic personality disorder is probably not rare. The results of this study suggest that the diagnosis has both descriptive and construct validity and that further study of the disorder with the DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria is needed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated trends in the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome at their center over a period of 8 years and assessed possible reasons for these trends. METHOD: They used previously defined operational criteria in conducting a prospective survey of cases of the syndrome among 2,695 neuroleptic-treated patients from Oct. 1, 1986, to Aug. 31, 1990. The frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome during this period was then compared with the frequency in a comparable period prior to October 1986. The investigators also assessed changes between the two periods in risk factors associated with the syndrome, including patients' mean age, sex ratio, diagnoses, and severity of illness; neuroleptic dosage, potency, and route of administration; concomitant use of lithium; and degree of agitation. RESULTS: Four cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were diagnosed during the more recent 47-month survey period, yielding a frequency of 0.15% +/- 0.05%. This represents a significant decline in the frequency of the syndrome from the estimate of 1.10% +/- 0.40% for the earlier survey period. Significantly fewer patients in the recent period had received intramuscular doses of neuroleptics. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome has declined significantly at this center. The decline appears to be attributable to increasing clinical awareness of the features of the syndrome, allowing early intervention and treatment, and to a reduction in risk factors, such as use of intramuscular neuroleptics.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to identify variables that correlate with the risk of suicide in two patient groups that differ mainly in their level of expressed aggression. METHOD: Twenty-eight psychiatric patients with a history of violent behavior who were in a forensic psychiatric facility were tested and compared to 28 psychiatric inpatients without a history of violence who were admitted to a large municipal hospital. Measures used included a battery of self-report questionnaires, with acceptable reliability and validity, that provided indices of risk of suicide, risk of violence, impulsivity, anger, anxiety, and various mood states. RESULTS: The two groups, matched on demographic variables and overall risk of suicide, differed significantly on the measured risk of violence. The two groups showed similar patterns of correlations between risk of suicide and such variables as risk of violence, anger, fear, state and trait anxiety, lack of impulse control, suspiciousness, and rebelliousness. They differed in the correlation between suicide risk and depression. In the nonviolent patients there was a high correlation between risk of suicide and sadness; in the violent patients there was no correlation between these variables. CONCLUSIONS: The low correlation between sadness and risk of suicide in the violent patients, and the low prevalence of affective disorder diagnoses in these patients compared to other patients, suggests that suicidal risk should be managed differently in highly violent patients than in others.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Dramatic increases in lengths of stay for general hospital psychiatric patients in New York City in recent years have raised speculation that general hospitals are assuming a large responsibility for care of the chronically mentally ill. This study examines changes in utilization patterns and patient characteristics to assess whether such a trend is occurring. METHOD: The authors obtained discharge abstract data for all New York City general hospital adult psychiatric patients in 1985 and 1988 as well as utilization data from the public general hospital system for 1977-1989. Three measures of chronicity were chosen: hospital stays longer than 60 days, discharges to long-term care, and three or more admissions per year. Data on psychiatric diagnoses and comorbid diagnoses for chronically ill patients were also reviewed. RESULTS: The mean length of stay of psychiatric patients in general hospitals has increased substantially in recent years and nearly tripled in the public hospitals during 1977-1989. Between 1985 and 1988, citywide increases were due largely to a growing proportion of patients with very long stays. Patients with stays longer than 60 days accounted for 35% of all inpatient days in 1988, compared with 27% in 1985. Patients with chronic illness accounted for half of all days in 1988, compared with 38% in 1985. CONCLUSIONS: Although many factors have contributed to these trends, the leading cause has been reimbursement policies favoring short-term inpatient care. Improving accountability for community treatment programs will be the key to redirecting funding priorities and creating more appropriate alternatives for the chronically mentally ill.\r"

METHOD: They examined 197 nursing home residents consecutively referred to a consulting team in a university-affiliated mental health center. These patients represented all patients evaluated by the consulting team at six nursing homes over a 2-year period (Sept. 1, 1984, through Aug. 30, 1986). RESULTS: Reasons for referral were diverse but fell into seven broad clusters: behavioral problems; mood-related problems; consultations requested by involuntary treatment services, patients, physicians, or other referring agencies; psychotic features; physical signs; impaired activities of daily living; and other. Behavioral problems were most commonly cited and tended to be associated with dementia diagnoses. Mood-related reasons for referral were most strongly associated with diagnoses of affective disorders, and diagnoses of schizophrenia and adjustment disorder were each associated with two or more reasons for referral. However, reasons for referral were distributed widely across diagnostic groups and were relatively weak predictors of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate the variety of problems for which nursing home staff are willing to seek psychiatric consultation but emphasize the need for professional psychiatric evaluation to establish a diagnostic base on which treatment interventions can be built.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of cases of drug treatment refusal under the Rivers decision, which mandated court adjudication of such cases, the authors made a retrospective study of all applications for court review during 1 year in New York State inpatient facilities. METHOD: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these 473 cases were compared with those of the 41,535 cases during the same period in which no court review was requested. RESULTS: A 1% prevalence of applications requesting court review for nonemergency administration of medication over objection was found. The patients who refused medication were more likely than the comparison patients to have a crime-associated commitment status, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and fewer previous hospital days, and they were more likely to be discharged. Medication refusers for whom applications for court review were submitted had relatively longer hospitalizations than the rest of the patients. Almost one-third of the applications submitted were withdrawn before court hearings, yielding a 0.7% prevalence of court-reviewed applications. Ninety-two percent of these applications for medication over objection were approved with virtually no change in the requested orders. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings demonstrate that a front-end judicial determination of competency to refuse medication results in a time-consuming procedure which fails to ensure real due process or provide individualized alternative treatment. A two-tier system with in-house clinical review preceding judicial review is proposed to remedy the deficiencies of the current system.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This investigation compared the efficacy of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine with that of the tricyclic imipramine in the treatment of anergic bipolar depressive illness. METHOD: A controlled, double-blind comparison was used to study 56 outpatients who met operationalized criteria for anergic bipolar depression. Patients with bipolar I and II depression were equally distributed between comparison groups. Outcome was measured by the patient-rated Beck Depression Inventory and the clinician-rated Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Raskin Mania and Depression Scales, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Pittsburgh Reversed Vegetative Symptom Scale. Twenty-eight patients were treated with tranylcypromine and 28 with imipramine. Seventy-three percent of bipolar depressive patients screened for the study met criteria for anergic depression, consistent with previous findings from studies in bipolar illness that stretch back over 100 years. RESULTS: Tranylcypromine produced statistically significant superior outcome in terms of lower attrition, greater symptomatic improvement, and higher global response without increased risk of treatment-emergent hypomania or mania. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that the apparently superior efficacy of tranylcypromine in bipolar depression is specifically linked to anergia and reversed neurovegetative symptoms. Bipolar I and bipolar II patients had comparable outcomes, but bipolar I patients had a significantly greater risk of treatment-emergent mood swings. Although the relatively poor showing of imipramine warrants close scrutiny, these findings provide further documentation of the utility of MAOIs in patients presenting with anergia, motor retardation, hyperphagia, and/or hypersomnia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine incidence and prevalence rates and long-term trends in incidence of anorexia nervosa by identifying all persons residing in the community of Rochester, Minn., during the 50-year period 1935 through 1984 who had the disorder. METHOD: From a community-based epidemiologic resource, 13,559 medical records with diagnoses of amenorrhea, starvation, weight loss, anorexia nervosa, or other conditions were screened to identify true cases of anorexia nervosa determined by using standard diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one residents (166 female and 15 male) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa; these were the incidence cases. Due to a quadratic trend in the rates for girls 10-19 years old, the incidence rate among female residents fell from 16.6 per 100,000 person-years in the 1935-1939 period to a low of 7.0 in 1950-1954 and increased to 26.3 in 1980-1984. The incidence rates for women 20 years old and older and for males remained constant. For females 15-24 years old, there was a linear increase. The overall age-adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 14.6 for females and 1.8 for males. The prevalence rate per 100,000 population was 269.9 for females and 22.5 for males. CONCLUSIONS: Anorexia nervosa is more common than previously recognized. Among girls 15-19 years old it is a very common chronic illness. Its incidence has increased among females 15-24 years old but not among older women or among males.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relation between hypochondriasis and age while controlling for the possible confounding influences of medical morbidity, social isolation, and other psychiatric disorder. METHOD: Consecutive patients attending a general medical clinic on randomly selected days were screened with a hypochondriasis self-report questionnaire. Those whose scores exceeded a preestablished cutoff level and a random sample of those who scored below it completed a research battery consisting of self-report questionnaires and structured interviews for DSM-III-R diagnoses of hypochondriasis and other axis I disorders. The patients' medical records were audited, and their physicians completed questionnaires about them. The 60 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for hypochondriasis at interview constituted the study group, and 100 patients randomly chosen from among those who scored below the cutoff for hypochondriasis constituted the comparison group. RESULTS: The hypochondriacal group was not older than the comparison group. Hypochondriacal patients aged 65 years and over did not differ significantly from younger hypochondriacal patients in hypochondriacal attitudes, somatization, tendency to amplify bodily sensation, or global assessment of their overall health, even though their aggregate medical morbidity was greater. The elderly hypochondriacal patients had higher levels of disability, but this appeared to be attributable to their medical status rather than to any increase in hypochondriasis. Within the comparison sample, subjects aged 65 years and over were not more hypochondriacal than those under 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Hypochondriasis is found to some degree in all patients and appears to be unrelated to age.\r"

  ".W": "The American Psychiatric Association established the Task Force on Quantitative Electrophysiological Assessment in May 1989 to consider several questions of interest to psychiatrists. From the inception of techniques for quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), the possibility was raised that it would substantially assist in the diagnosis of brain disorders. However, controversy exists over the scientific basis for such approaches and the training necessary for interpretation of computerized records. The task force's charge was to report 1) the present state of scientific knowledge about qEEG, 2) the role of qEEG in clinical psychiatric practice at the present time, 3) the training necessary for the use of qEEG techniques, and 4) the possible future of the technique in the study of mental disorders. The task force concluded that qEEG is particularly useful for the detection of abnormalities in slow waves, which are a feature of delirium, dementia, intoxication, and other syndromes involving gross CNS dysfunction. The ability of qEEG to help in the diagnosis of other disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, is not yet established. Clinical replications and sharing of normative and patient data bases are necessary for the advancement of this field. Proper use of this technique requires extensive training in a center experienced in its use. Standards for training and for using the technology in psychiatry are urgently needed. This report was approved by the Board of Trustees in December 1990.\r"

A component of this strategy has been the funding of scientific research \"into the gaps in knowledge in the smoking controversy.\" Grant review and selection are performed by a group of independent scientists. Knowledgeable observers believe that the existence of this research funding program in general, and the Scientific Advisory Board in particular, is intended by the industry to reinforce doubts in the public mind about the severity of the hazards posed by smoking. Because the Advisory Board has never taken a public stance against the industry's position that the causal relationship between smoking and disease remains unproven, I polled these scientists to determine whether they believed that smoking is a cause of lung cancer. Despite repeated opportunities, only four of 13 board members responded, all affirmatively; two others have expressed their judgment that smoking causes lung cancer in their professional publications. Thus, over half of the Board members, and the Board as a whole, have not gone on record as rejecting the industry's \"party line.\" It might be hoped that the American scientists would follow the lead of the members of a similar body of scientists in Australia who have taken a strong and public stand against the industry position that smoking is not an established cause of disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: No representative surveys of scientific opinion about blind review have been published, and there is very little information on the success of the blinding process. The American Journal of Public Health has practiced blind review since 1977. METHODS: In 1989 to 1990 312 of its reviewers were asked to identify author and institution in the manuscript they reviewed, to provide clues to such identification, to express their opinion concerning blind review, and to offer reasons for their opinion. RESULTS: Reviewers claimed to be able to identify author and/or institution in 47% of the 614 chances offered; identification was incorrect 16% of the time, overall identification correct 39% of the time. Self-referencing was the clue to identification in 62%, personal knowledge in 38% of the cases. If only personal knowledge cases are considered, blinding was successful 83% of the time. Blinding was favored by 75% of the reviewers with most asserting it eliminated bias. Reasons given for opposing blind review included the following: blinding not possible, identification will not influence judgment, and its obverse, identification assists judgment. CONCLUSIONS: For the American Journal of Public Health blinding is usually, but not always, successful; and the majority of its reviewers favor current policy. Until more definitive data are in, reviewer preference, which differs from journal to journal, seems the most legitimate guide to journal policy on blind review.\r"

METHODS: From 1981-1983, 549 White men were examined by flexible sigmoidoscopy and completed self-administered questionnaires including smoking histories. RESULTS: One or more colon polyps were detected in 76 men. Standardized prevalence rates (SPR) for polyps increased by smoking category (never smoked = 0.094; ex-smokers = 0.118, current smokers = 0.214) and by cigarettes per day, years of smoking, and pack-years among both current and ex-smokers. Both adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps showed an association with smoking while other types of polyps and polyps with unspecified histology did not. The risk associated with smoking was greater for polyps greater than one centimeter in diameter. An interaction with occupational exposures was suggested by a greater increase in the SPR for polyps among current smokers employed as pattern makers for more than 10 years than among current smokers similarly employed for 10 years or less. CONCLUSIONS: Since at least some colon polyps are considered precursor lesions to colon cancer, one of the most common cancers in the United States, this report suggests that the possible link between colon polyps and smoking deserves further evaluation.\r"

METHODS: Changes in the ecology of passive smoking were investigated in a sample of infants in central North Carolina followed from birth to one year of age. RESULTS: The prevalence of tobacco smoke absorption, indicated by excretion of cotinine, increased from 53 percent to 77 percent (95% CI of difference: 14, 35) during the first year of life. Most infants (92 percent) excreting cotinine at three weeks of age were also excreting it at one year. Moreover, 61 percent of infants not excreting cotinine at age three weeks were excreting it at one year. This increase reflected an increased exposure to household and, particularly, nonhousehold sources of smoke; the proportion of infants exposed to nonhousehold smokers increased from 14 percent to 36 percent. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that prevention of the onset of passive smoking should begin very early.\r"

The analyses examined relationships between smoking initiation and 11 explanatory variables using logistic regression with the combined sample and with Black and White samples. RESULTS: Over two years, 24 percent of Whites and 14 percent of Blacks started to smoke. Whites were more likely to start smoking at age 12 and Blacks at age 14. Having a best friend who smoked increased the odds of initiating smoking over twofold for Whites but had no effect on the odds of smoking for Blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Whites initiate smoking earlier than Blacks and are more likely to be influenced by friend behavior.\r"

METHODS: Data from the Southwestern sample of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) were employed to investigate differences in health behaviors, risk factors and health indicators between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers among Mexican Americans. Differences between those smoking less than 10 and 10 or more cigarettes per day were also examined by age group and gender. RESULTS: Positive associations between smoking status and heavy coffee and alcohol consumption were found across gender and age groups. Less consistent was the finding that smokers weighed less than nonsmokers. Lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in middle-aged smokers, and higher levels of depressive symptomatology among smoking women were found. Those smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were more likely to report heavy coffee consumption, with younger men reporting greater activity limitation due to poor health. Middle-aged men and women in the 10+ category were generally in better health than lighter smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Modest associations between cigarette smoking, health behaviors and risk factors found in other studies were confirmed in this Mexican American population. Few significant associations between smoking and health status were noted.\r"

METHODS: Standardized comparisons of the use of alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes among military personnel and civilians were conducted with data from the 1985 Worldwide Survey of Alcohol and Nonmedical Drug Use among Military Personnel and the 1985 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The two data sets were equated for age and geographic location of respondents, and civilian substance use rates were standardized to reflect the sociodemographic distribution of the military. RESULTS: Military personnel were significantly less likely than civilians to use drugs, but were significantly more likely to use alcohol and cigarettes and to engage in heavy use of alcohol and cigarettes. Heavy drinking was especially likely among young military men. Military women were similar to military men in their smoking and drug use patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that military policies and programs have been notably effective in reducing drug use, but that efforts to limit alcohol and cigarette use should be intensified. Military efforts directed against alcohol abuse should be targeted toward younger men, while smoking and drug prevention programs should be directed toward both men and women.\r"

METHODS: To identify risk factors for self-reported suicide attempts by Navajo adolescents, we analyzed the 1988 Indian Health Service Adolescent Health Survey that was administered to 7,254 students in grades 6 through 12 on the Navajo reservation. The responses of students reporting a past suicide attempt were compared to others. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent (N = 971) reported a previous suicide attempt; over half of those admitted to more than one attempt. Controlling for age, a logistic regression model revealed the following associations with suicide attempts: a history of mental health problems (OR = 3.2); alienation from family and community (OR = 3.2); having a friend who attempted suicide (OR = 2.8); weekly consumption of hard liquor (OR = 2.7); a family history of a suicide or attempt (OR = 2.3); poor self-perception of health (OR = 2.2); a history of physical abuse (OR = 1.9); female gender (OR = 1.7); and sexual abuse (OR = 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to prevent adolescent suicide attempts in this population should target individuals with those risk factors of the highest risk and prevalence of exposure.\r"

It examines the utilization rates, within health sectors, and settings for the provision of mental health services. METHODS: Data are based on an islandwide probability sample of 18- to 64-year-old respondents living in low socioeconomic areas. We assessed need with the Psychiatric Symptom and Dysfunction Scales. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of our study population (31.5%) met criteria for need. Of these, only 32% had received any mental health care in the past year. Need was significantly associated with use of physical or mental health services for mental health problems. We found those who needed services to be five times more likely than those who did not need services to have used one or both sectors of care at least once in the past year. Among the first group 21.8% used the physical health sector to deal with mental health problems in contrast with 17.9% who sought care in the mental health sector. In the physical health sector, subjects used the public and private settings equally. In the mental health sector, 70% of subjects used the public setting. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests the nonpsychiatric physician as a main provider for mental health treatment.\r"

We analyzed data from a population-based prospective study to determine dietary risk factors for hospitalization with gallstone disease. METHODS: We evaluated the role of dietary constituents, fasting, and dieting on subsequent hospitalization with gallstone disease among 4,730 women, ages 25 to 74 years, who participated in the first follow-up of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Baseline dietary variables were established through a 24-hour dietary recall and a medical history. Proportional hazards models were used to calculate the effects of dietary variables while controlling for baseline risk factors. RESULTS: After an average of 10 years follow-up, gallstone disease was confirmed by hospital records among 216 women who denied gallstone disease at the baseline examination. The hazard rate of hospitalization with gallstone disease increased with increasing overnight fasting period and with dieting. Intake of fiber showed a small protective effect. The effect of energy intake was significant only among women younger than age 50 years at baseline. Results were not affected by adjustment for known risk factors for gallstone disease or other dietary factors. CONCLUSION: A long overnight fasting period, dieting, and low fiber intake may increase the risk of hospitalization with gallstone disease.\r"

METHODS: Pap smear screening rates, beliefs about appropriate screening intervals and factors affecting screening were examined using 1987 National Health Interview Survey data. RESULTS: Results indicate that through age 69, Blacks are screened at similar or higher rates than Whites. Hispanics, particularly those speaking only or mostly Spanish, are least likely to have received a Pap smear within the last three years. Of women who had never heard of or never had a Pap smear, nearly 80 percent reported contact with a medical practitioner in the past two years, while more than 90 percent reported a contact in the past five years. Overall, the most frequently reported reason for not having a recent Pap smear was procrastinating or not believing it was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in developing screening programs, Hispanics, particularly Spanish speakers, must be targeted. In addition, educational programs should target unscreened women who forego the test due to underestimating its importance, procrastination, or because their medical care provider did not suggest the procedure. Women must be intensively educated that Pap smears should be scheduled routinely to detect asymptomatic cervical cancer.\r"

The industry professes a desire to clear up the smoking and health \"question\" and often points to its support of the Council for Tobacco Research (CTR) as evidence of its interest in investigating the health dangers of smoking. This paper presents results of a survey of CTR-funded scientists regarding their beliefs about the health dangers posed by smoking cigarettes. The vast majority of scientists funded by the CTR believe that cigarette smoking is an addiction that causes a wide range of serious, often fatal, diseases. This result suggests that the tobacco industry is unwilling to accept even the opinions of scientists it has deemed worthy of funding. Scientists should consider the ethical implications of accepting funds from the CTR and other tobacco industry-supported institutions.\r"

Here, we report our experience in estimating person-years denominators in the highly urbanized, rapidly expanding population of Maricopa County, Arizona. The usual sources of population estimates were found to be of little use for public health purposes, and so we report on a method for obtaining smoothed person-years figures that can accurately reflect population acceleration which varies from one time period to another. Our method is to regress the logarithm of census enumerations on quadratic or tertic polynomials in time. We describe how differential reliability of census figures can be incorporated into our procedure, and how the problem of missing census data can be handled by an iterated regression method. Our evidence suggests that the logarithmic regression model works well, even in the face of rapid and erratic population growth or decline.\r"

Tests of knowledge were responses in a mail questionnaire to clinical vignettes, designed to elicit the content of antibiotic regimens used for patients at risk. The research design enabled detection of (1) the effect of the interventions; (2) the differences in their effect; (3) the attenuation of their effect; and (4) the effect of time. Where baseline knowledge was low, it was improved and did not rapidly disappear. Both mail interventions were equally effective, in most instances, and there was no attenuation of the interventions' effect and no effect of time on the control groups' knowledge over a 4 1/2 month period. The results suggest that it is possible to improve clinicians' knowledge of expert recommendations through direct mail intervention.\r"

Very small extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts occasionally require visualization but do not admit the traditional 6.5-mm intraoperative flexible choledochoscope. We have prospectively examined the use of a 2-mm choledochoscope for the intraoperative evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts in 36 patients. In 27 patients, the choledochoscope was advanced through the cystic duct stump for examination of the common bile duct following cholangiography. The scope was successfully passed into the cystic duct stump and into the common bile duct in 76 per cent of patients. Inability to pass the scope through the cystic duct was usually due to acute angulation of the cystic duct/common duct junction. In an additional five patients, intraoperative cholangiography revealed a filling defect in a very small duct. A choledochotomy was made and the 2-mm choledochoscope was used to exclude the presence of stones in a small bile duct. In four patients the choledochoscope was used during a Puestow procedure to visualize and help extract stones in the tail and head of the gland. No complications occurred in these patients due to the use of the choledochoscope. We conclude that the 2-mm choledochoscope aids in internal visualization of small intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. It may be useful as an adjunct to cholangiography in determining the nature of filling defects.\r"

  ".W": "Although the incidence of significant complications occurring during endoscopic procedures that require sedation are low, it has been demonstrated that they are usually related to cardiovascular system dysfunction. Such complications are a manifestation of cardiac hypoxia and are a function of the arterial oxygen desaturation. A practical method of monitoring such patients includes continuous oxygen saturation measurements and EKG monitoring. From October, 1987 to July, 1989, a total of 730 endoscopic examinations were performed using a combination of meperidine and midazolam as an intravenous (IV) bolus for sedation. Supplemental nasal oxygen was routinely given at 2 L per minute and real-time monitoring was performed with electrocardiograph and continuous pulse oximeter. There were no deaths and only four untoward events related to medication that altered the course of the examination. Transient hypoxemia that responds to gentle stimulation and bradycardia resolving with cessation of endoscope advancement are viewed as physiologic responses and not complications. All occurrences were immediately identified and corrected appropriately, and no morbidity resulted. With proper monitoring of oxygen saturation, pulse, and cardiac rhythm in a patient with nasal oxygen, IV bolus administration of meperidine and midazolam is a safe and adequate sedation even in the elderly and debilitated patient.\r"

Mortality in patients compliant with follow-up was 5 per cent (1/19), as compared with 24 per cent (12/51) in patients who were not compliant with follow-up sclerotherapy.

This procedure has the advantages of reduced hospital stay, early return to work, diminished abdominal wall scarring, and less patient discomfort. The complex nature of this procedure and the current lack of extensive clinical experience preclude the traditional \"hands-on\" training normally practiced in surgical residency programs. At the University of Maryland, we have developed a program to instruct both surgeons and surgical residents in the techniques of laparoscopic surgery. Technical competence is achieved under the close supervision and guidance of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Training of residents in this procedure, therefore, is not very different than that for other general surgical procedures. Surgeons already in clinical practice, however, gain experience under somewhat different circumstances. Initial training involves didactic instruction through laparoscopic surgical atlases and educational videotapes. Further training uses a simulation device which enables the trainee to practice techniques of laparoscopic suturing, knot-tying, and clip application. Actual operative experience is acquired primarily in experimental animal preparations. Laparoscopic-guided removal of the gallbladder is performed in young swine (20-25 kg) under conditions that mimic those in the operating room. Further clinical experience can be acquired by assisting on several laparoscopic operations, usually involving diagnostic or pelvic procedures. Actual operative experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, of course, comprises the final phase of the educational program. The introduction of clinical laparoscopic training into general surgery residency programs should influence the widespread adoption of this new procedure.\r"

Physical and laboratory findings were of little diagnostic value, whereas plain abdominal radiographs showed evidence of perforation in 86 per cent. All patients were operated on promptly after diagnosis of perforation. Delay in diagnosis of perforation beyond 24 hours in six patients was associated with a high morbidity and two deaths. Analysis of published series confirmed that delay in diagnosis and delay in operation after perforation were associated with a higher mortality rate than early diagnosis with or without operation. We recommend operative intervention in all patients with clinical evidence of perforation following ES.\r"

There were 30 women and 11 men and their ages ranged between 49 and 98 years (mean age 77). All patients presented with abdominal pain, tenderness, chills, and fever. Clinical jaundice was present in 95 per cent of the patients. Initial endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 17 of the 41 patients. In 24 patients cholangitis persisted or recurred and further therapy was carried out. Surgery was successful in controlling sepsis in ten of the 24 patients. Repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in four of 13 patients. Surgery was successful in one of nine patients who had failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. Nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in only two of nine patients. Six patients died after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. We conclude that initial endoscopic papillotomy should be attempted in patients with calculous cholangitis.

The Nd-YAG laser has been used in our department to treat dysphagia resulting from cancer of the esophagus since 1986. Our rapid, one-stage cannulation technique using the Nd-YAG laser in both contact and noncontact modes was applied to 35 cases of carcinoma of the esophagus with the aim of achieving rapid and safe palliation of dysphagia. During the treatment we aimed not to coagulate the tumor and await sloughing, but to vaporize the tumor and ablate as much as possible in a single session. In this way there was less need for repeat sessions to create an adequate lumen. In a small number of patients (9) who had tight strictures with no visible lumen, a pre-laser dilation was required to allow visualization of the lumen and tumor vaporization. For nondilated patients (26) we achieved a 15-mm lumen in an average of 1.6 sessions, and in the dilated patients (9) this was achieved in one session in all patients. Functional improvement occurred in 28 patients (80%). There were four minor complications and no mortality associated with the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The American Board of Surgery requires that applicants become familiar with gastrointestinal endoscopy. This report retrospectively reviews Akron City Hospital's ten-year experience in surgical endoscopic training. In July, 1982, a two-month endoscopy rotation was established for fourth-year surgical residents. The average number of endoscopies performed by the resident as surgeon increased from 49.0 in 1984-85, to 167.7 in 1988-89. The percentage of endoscopies performed as surgeon increased from 46.4 per cent to 87.3 per cent during the same period. These increases are coincident with the addition of two trained surgical endoscopists to the faculty. This improvement in resident experience is attributed to an increase in endoscopies performed by faculty surgeons (634 procedures in 1988-89 vs. 291 procedures in 1984-85), and to an increase in percentage of procedures performed as surgeon with faculty gastroenterologists. Two of the three residents graduating in the final year of the study met the SAGES guidelines for upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy. Based upon this ten-year experience, we recommend that surgical residencies desiring to develop endoscopic training recruit trained surgical endoscopists and develop a collaborative relationship between medical and surgical faculty.\r"

  ".W": "In an eight-year, ongoing study of 120 patients, 39 with carcinomas and 81 with adenomas, no patient has produced a new carcinoma despite a high incidence of metachronous adenomas. Colonoscopy can identify early carcinomas that can be resected for cure. In addition, colonoscopy can identify the adenomatous polyps and with polypectectomy prevent the progression to carcinoma. Colonoscopy is more accurate than air contrast barium enema, provides a tissue diagnosis, and allows polypectomy. When applied according to risk factors known to be cost effective, colonoscopy leads to earlier diagnosis and thus improved long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant esophageal obstruction in patients with advanced and metastatic carcinoma is unsuitable for surgery. Palliative treatment must provide adequate swallowing with minimum complications in these often seriously ill patients. Twenty consecutive patients underwent endoscopic Nd:YAG contact laser resection and vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) for advanced esophageal carcinoma since August, 1985. Average duration of the disease when first referred was 7.2 months. Tumor cell type was either squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11) or adenocarcinoma (n = 9). Tumor location was distal (n = 14), middle (n = 5), or upper (n = 2). Mean tumor length was 7.5 cm. Mean preoperative luminal diameter was 1 mm, with total obstruction in ten (50%) patients. The operative procedure in all patients was under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation. Rigid and flexible endoscopes were both used as indicated. Mean postoperative luminal diameter was 15 mm. All but four were able to swallow fluids on the first postoperative day, followed by semisolids the next day without discomfort. Minor perforation was noted in three cases and managed in two conservatively. One more patient had difficulty in swallowing due to extra-esophageal compression, in spite of a technically successful laser therapy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was carried out in eight cases. Eleven patients were retreated successfully for recurrent obstruction and two were treated more than twice, at a mean of six-week intervals. Endoscopic contact laser resectional vaporization with esophageal dilatation was relatively safe and provided an improved quality of life in this preliminary study group, providing a mean survival of 18.5 weeks (range 2-50 weeks).\r"

  ".W": "In view of the current incorporation of gastrointestinal endoscopy within surgical residency programs and therefore increased performance of these procedures by surgeons, it is appropriate to devise an effective database which allows retrieval of pertinent information for quality assurance (QA) and utilization review (UR) programs. During the development of two complete surgical endoscopy teaching programs, the QA process has been extensively analyzed for the minimal essential information required to perform QA in compliance with regulations of JCAHO and other reviewing authorities. Over the previous five years this information has been gathered on 3098 patients and incorporated into a database which allows for review of the medical record and the endoscopy unit record for QA and UR. Although the data were entered into a computerized database program for ease of data retrieval and analysis, this information can be complied by the \"stubby pencil\" method in paper files or log books. The QA process is integrated as part of the general surgery QA, not under a separate endoscopy committee. Results demonstrate that the minimal essential data for the medical record included: patient identification data, endoscopist, procedure, additional procedures, medications, indications, preoperative diagnosis, description of procedure, findings, tissue obtained, complications, final diagnosis, and discharge planning. The endoscopy unit record contained: patient identification, endoscopist, procedure, tissue obtained, and suite complications. From these data elements, complete QA was performed and included: completeness of documentation, appropriate indications, complications, endoscopic versus pathologic diagnosis, and unsuccessful procedures. Utilization review included: number of normal procedures, benefits of screening and surveillance procedures, and appropriateness of preoperative evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) fell significantly during the first five minutes after nebulisation with further deterioration at 15-20 minutes. Ten of these infants were followed up for another two hours and showed slight improvement. Even after the second hour TcPO2 had not reached baseline values. Three months later the response to salbutamol and a placebo of equal acidity (pH 3.9) was studied in 11 infants from the same group, now free of symptoms. Lung function tests were included and showed no significant changes in specific conductance and volume corrected maximum expiratory flows (Vmax at functional residual capacity/thoracic gas volume). However, hypoxaemia occurred after the acidic placebo with a significant drop of TcPO2 (mean 0.9 kPa); SO2 decreased similarly but this did not reach significance. After salbutamol there was a further significant deterioration of mean TcPO2 (1.4 kPa) and of SO2. These results show that beside a possible pharmacological effect of salbutamol the acidity of the aerosol also induces hypoxaemia in infants.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty three patients (age range 0.5-40 months) with recurrent cyanotic episodes underwent physiological recordings, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) from a monitor modified for use at home (Kontron 821S). Of 69 episodes in which the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, Nellcor N200) was less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 20 seconds and/or central cyanosis was present, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed (less than or equal to 20 mmHg or 2.67 kPa) in every episode. The pulse oximeter identified hypoxaemia in 62 out of 69 episodes, failing in seven episodes due to signal loss from movement artefact. In only seven of 69 episodes was there an accompanying apnoeic pause (greater than or equal to 20 seconds), and heart rate fell to less than or equal to 80 beats/minute in only five of 28 episodes in which an electrocardiogram was recorded. In 32 episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 60%, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed after a median time interval of 16 seconds (maximum time interval 30 seconds). The TcPO2 monitor was then used in an uncontrolled trial at home in 350 patients at increased risk of sudden death and/or hypoxaemia. Indications for monitoring included apparent life threatening events or cyanotic episodes (n = 163), prematurity and prematurity related disorders (n = 86), and sudden unexpected death in one or more siblings (n = 122). The TcPO2 monitor detected cyanotic episodes at home in 81 patients, 52 of whom received vigorous stimulation and/or mouth to mouth resuscitation. Twenty one of these 52 patients had further hypoxaemic episodes documented in hospital with pulse oximetry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight girls received amoxicillin. In five of them the anaerobic flora showed a reduction in total counts and in numbers of different species, and all eight girls got a heavy colonisation with enterobacteria during treatment. Three weeks after treatment the anaerobic and aerobic flora had reversed to the pretreatment composition. In 10 girls treated with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole the anaerobic flora remained unaffected and no enterobacterial overgrowth was registered during the study period. We propose that antibiotics could be one among several factors involved in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, by suppression of the anaerobic microflora and promotion of the colonisation with enterobacteria.\r"

Of the 77 survey respondents 13 had used only the Kabipen, 14 the syringe only, and 50 had used both systems. Altogether 46 (92%) of those who had used both systems preferred the Kabipen. Children over 10 years were more likely to self administer hGH with the Kabipen (64%) than syringe (25%). Patient instructions, convenience of use, and comfort of use were rated better for the Kabipen than syringe. With a dose setting of 2 units the Kabipen delivered a mean (SD) of 1.997 (0.073) units with 102.5% recovery from a unit cartridge. In summary the Kabipen is an accurate device clearly preferred by the majority of hGH recipients surveyed.\r"

The overall prevalence of overt liver disease indicated by the presence of an enlarged liver or spleen (or both) was 4.2%. The age related prevalence rose to a peak in adolescence, and then fell in patients over 20 years old. The implied increase in mortality among those with liver disease was not explained by deaths from liver disease, which were rare. Male patients were significantly more affected than female, the ratio being 3:1 among adolescents. Increasing prevalence of liver disease in patients with cystic fibrosis is, therefore, not just a result of longevity.\r"

Symmetrical localised hypodense lesions within the thalami and pons were demonstrated in both cases on computed tomography of the brain and striking findings in the pons in one case on magnetic resonance imaging. Influenza A encephalitis is not easy to recognise clinically and serological confirmation can only be made after 10 days.

The mean annual number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome was thus 3.9, giving a mean annual incidence of 0.38/100,000 of population under 15 years of age (95% confidence intervals 0.25 to 0.56/100,000). The incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome causing permanent neurological defects in children under 15 years of age was 1.4/10 million annually (95% confidence intervals 0.035 to 7.8/10 million). Our figures appeared to be one fourth to a half of that reported earlier in children and even lower than those in adults.

HBV specific DNA was detected in three maternal mononuclear cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two of four infants born to the three mothers with HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells developed acute or fulminant hepatitis within three months after birth. Two infants were effectively prevented from infection with HBV by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were free of HBV infection within the next seven months to 3.5 years.

  ".W": "In a 6-month pilot study of 7 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we tested a treatment involving the extracorporeal photoactivation of biologically inert methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) by ultraviolet A energy to a form that covalently cross-links lymphocyte DNA; the injured cells are reinfused into the patient. Prior experimental studies had indicated that this regimen produces an immune reaction against antigens on treated T cells, and a clinical trial in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma had been successful. The current study patients were treated monthly, on 2 successive days (or biweekly, later on). Between 12 and 16 weeks of therapy, there appeared to be a breakpoint, after which the joint counts and joint scores of 4 of the patients began to improve. In 3 of the 4 patients, these measures eventually diminished by a mean of 71% and 80% of baseline values, respectively, and there was variable improvement in less direct indicators of clinical response. The joint counts and scores of the fourth patient improved modestly (by 33% and 59% of baselines, respectively) but he required alternative therapy, and those of the remaining 3 study patients did not improve. Mean slopes for the joint counts were significantly different from zero after the apparent breakpoint (but not before), whether one examined the 4 apparent responders (P = 0.01) or the entire group of 7 patients (P = 0.01). After completion of therapy, there was also a delay, of 2-3 months, in the clinical deterioration of those patients who had improved. There was only 1 mechanical adverse effect--a single episode of transient hypotension in 102 treatment sessions--and no toxic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All-night polysomnography was performed in a sleep laboratory during the last 2 days of placebo treatment and on days 13, 14, 89, and 90 of tenoxicam treatment. Although there was improvement in the patients' clinical condition, there were no treatment-related changes in any of the sleep parameters. Eight of the 13 patients, however, were found to have primary sleep disorders. Four had periodic leg movements during sleep, 3 had sleep apneas, and 1 had a combination of both disorders. The implications of these findings in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed.\r"

In this study, we utilized one of these scoring methods to examine the progression of radiologic damage as related to duration of disease. Two hundred ninety-two patients from 3 different participating centers in the Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System were included. Six hundred fifty films of the hands and wrists, obtained from 210 patients, were scored for erosions and joint space narrowing. The average annual rate of progression of the total radiologic score, which sums erosion and joint space abnormalities and has a maximum possible score of 314, was approximately 4 units per year over the first 25 years after onset; this progression was more rapid in the earlier years of disease and slightly slower in the later years. Data were insufficient to accurately determine the progression rate in disease of more than 25 years duration.\r"

In addition, the participation of other family members and paid employees in household work was evaluated. One hundred forty-two women with RA and 58 female friends/neighbors completed questionnaires which assessed household work performance and health, family, and personal variables. Performance was measured in 4 ways: the current amount of time spent on household work, the proportion of the household work done, and the changes in time and proportion since just before the onset of RA. Functional status was measured via the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Pain, anxiety and depression, and general health perception were measured via the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. The results indicate that household work disability exists in women with RA, but is substantial only in women with moderate-to-severe disease. In families in which the wife/mother has moderate-to-severe RA, the other family members spend 7 hours more per week on household work than in control families, but there was no increase in the use of paid household employees. Health factors were the strongest predictors of household work disability, but family and personal factors also had significant effects. Household work disability in women with moderate or severe RA merits more attention because of the importance of household work to family functioning and the negative effects that changes in this area can produce.\r"

The active material was present in fluids treated with protease inhibitors, was heat stable, and was unaffected by incubation with hyaluronidase. Chromatographic isolation of synovial fluid fibronectin by gelatin affinity and by immunoaffinity on antifibronectin monoclonal antibody BD4 yielded similar quantities of protein for each of 3 fluids. Synovial fluid proteins with the BD4 fibronectin epitope accounted for essentially all of the phagocytosis-enhancing activity and expressed this activity by opsonizing target activators. Additional chromatographic analyses of synovial fluid fibronectin with the BD4 epitope were carried out using Sepharose-bearing gelatin and 4 additional antifibronectin monoclonal antibodies. The opsonic materials were characterized as having 2 distinct fibronectin epitopes, which always mapped from the cell adhesive domain to the carboxyl-terminus of plasma fibronectin, but only rarely contained the gelatin binding domain.\r"

Exposure of RAC to recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor homodimer BB (PDGF-BB; 2-200 ng/ml) in the presence of stimulatory and substimulatory concentrations of IL-1 alpha resulted in a marked augmentation of metalloproteinase and PGE2 production. PDGF-BB exerted no agonist effects on RAC responsiveness. PDGF-BB up-regulated the number of IL-1 receptors per chondrocyte but had no effect on receptor affinity. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D caused a concentration-dependent suppression of the PDGF-BB-mediated potentiation of radiolabeled IL-1 alpha binding to RAC and cell responsiveness to IL-1 alpha. Similarly, IL-1 increased the number of PDGF receptors on RAC without changing receptor affinity. These data are discussed within the context of cytokine-growth factor interactions as components of the pathogenesis of arthritic diseases.\r"

In individual patients with brief episodes of Lyme arthritis, PBL had similar low levels of reactivity with the 20-kd, 31-kd, 34-kd, 41-kd, 55/58-kd, and 66-kd spirochetal polypeptides. In individual patients with prolonged arthritis, PBL usually had similar marked responsiveness to the 34-kd, 41-kd, 55/58-kd, and 66-kd polypeptides, but they had greater reactivity with the 34-kd outer surface protein B than with the 31-kd outer surface protein A (P less than 0.05). In the 2 patients tested, paired samples of synovial fluid lymphocytes and PBL had a similar pattern of reactivity, but the response was 2-100-fold greater in synovial fluid lymphocytes. We conclude that patients with prolonged Lyme arthritis have T cell responses to multiple spirochetal polypeptides.\r"

The place of birth or residence of these patients was within the area endemic for adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I. The age at onset of articular symptoms tended to be higher in these patients than in typical rheumatoid arthritis patients. Anti-HTLV-I antibodies were detected in both sera and synovial fluids from all patients. Western blot analysis revealed antibodies to viral gag proteins (p19, p24, and p28). Atypical lymphocytes with nuclear indentations, consistent with ATL-like cells, were observed in both synovial fluid and synovial tissue. Furthermore, HTLV-I proviral DNA was integrated into the DNA of synovial fluid cells and synovial tissue cells. These findings suggest that HTLV-I might be involved in the pathogenesis of this unique arthropathy.\r"

These antibodies also characterize neonatal lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis associated with Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Ro-positive sera may contain either or both of 2 sets of antibodies, recognizing either a 60-kd or a 52-kd polypeptide component of the Ro particle. We found in this study that the immune response to the 60-kd Ro antigen is heterogeneous. Some sera specifically recognize the native Ro antigen but fail to bind the corresponding denatured polypeptides. In addition, after immunodepletion using the denatured 60-kd Ro polypeptide, all anti-Ro-positive sera tested still contained high titers of antibodies recognizing conformational determinants on the Ro antigen. The frequent immunodominance of anti-Ro antibodies targeted to conformational determinants suggests that native autoantigens may directly drive the autoimmune response.\r"

Sera from 22 of 50 PBC patients stained the nuclei of HEp-2 cells in a pattern of 5-20 discrete dots, on indirect immunofluorescence. Typically, the titers were higher than 1:1,280. This staining pattern was seen in only 4 of 1,240 ANA-positive samples from patients with other connective tissue diseases, and in none of the ANA-positive sera from 49 patients with other liver diseases. Sera which stained the nuclear dots bound a 95-kd polypeptide in immunoblots of HeLa nuclei and in immunoprecipitates of 35S-methionine-labeled HeLa extracts. Affinity-purified antibodies from the 95-kd protein reproduced the nuclear dot immunofluorescence staining pattern, demonstrating that this polypeptide is located in the nuclear dots. ANA of this type, therefore, occur in 44% of patients with PBC, and they appear to be specific for PBC. These antibodies bind a 95-kd protein that is discrete and is scattered throughout the nucleus.\r"

The disease predominantly affects the wrists, fingers, shoulders, and peripheral entheses, and its onset occurs after age 18. Genetic transmission is autosomal dominant, with 100% penetrance, and is not related to the HLA system. The clinical and radiologic features are strikingly similar in all patients in successive generations and different branches of the genealogic tree, and this suggests monogenic transmission.\r"

Serum samples from these patients reacted by immunodiffusion against serum from a rodent that had been caught in the patients' house. The precipitin line showed complete immunologic identity with anti-Jo-1. To study the specificity of this serum-serum reaction, 2 mice (Mus musculus) and 1 rat (Rattus rattus) from the neighboring areas of the patients' house were caught and killed. Sections of the liver, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle were processed for histopathologic examination and for direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies of the patients' sera. The rodents' sera were tested by immunodiffusion against serum samples from 25 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 11 with rheumatoid arthritis, 6 with mixed connective tissue disease, and 11 with various other rheumatic diseases, as well as 16 healthy controls. A serum-serum precipitin reaction was noted between the rodents' sera and sera from 2 of the patients with polymyositis-like syndrome. A distinct, but weaker, reaction was found with 2 lupus patients' sera (8%), and with 1 healthy control serum (6%). The rodents' sera were antinuclear antibody positive by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. These results, suggest that some rodents could be carriers of an as-yet-unknown transmissible agent that, in susceptible individuals, induces clinical and serologic manifestations similar to those of polymyositis.\r"

Total tenoxicam concentrations in synovial fluid were always less than those in plasma, and there was little fluctuation in plasma or synovial concentrations over the dosage interval, although there was substantial inter-subject variation in both concentrations. There was a significant relationship between the tenoxicam dosage when expressed as mg/kg of body weight and the average steady-state total concentration of tenoxicam in plasma (r = 0.80, P = 0.006); this accounted for a substantial proportion of the intersubject variation. The mean +/- SD steady-state concentrations in synovial fluid and plasma were 3.9 +/- 1.8 micrograms/ml and 9.2 +/- 3.7 micrograms/ml, respectively, yielding a mean +/- SD synovial fluid: plasma ratio of 0.43 +/- 0.12. Synovial fluid:plasma ratios of total tenoxicam correlated with synovial fluid:plasma ratios of albumin (r = 0.71, P = 0.02). The synovial fluid:plasma ratio of unbound tenoxicam was 0.90 +/- 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.68-1.11), which was not significantly different from a value of 1 (t = -1.09, P = 0.31).\r"

Clinical status was measured using tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and overall physician assessment. Health status was measured using the physical, psychological, pain, and arthritis impact scores of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. Scores on all clinical and health status measures indicated substantial disease effects in the group with recent-onset RA. For most of these measures, effect size analysis indicated that clinical and health status impacts in the recent-onset RA group were similar in magnitude to those found in the groups with more established disease, with scores in both groups being substantially different from those found in the no RA group. These results document the magnitude of the clinical and health status impacts in recent-onset RA. They lend support to recent arguments advocating aggressive therapy earlier in the course of this frequently disabling disease.\r"

Thirteen of the synovial fluids stimulated chemotaxis of normal human neutrophils. The chemotactic activity was heat-sensitive and was not inhibited by antibody to C5a or antibody to interleukin-8, or by a competitive inhibitor of the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe. A culture supernatant of Borrelia burgdorferi also contained neutrophil chemoattractants. Chromatography demonstrated that the chemoattractants in the synovial fluid samples were different from those in the B burgdorferi culture supernatant. One of the major chemotactic factors in Lyme disease synovial fluid had a calculated molecular weight of 13,900. We conclude that a novel, host-derived chemoattractant is present in the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme disease.\r"

To define further the chronic neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease, we studied 27 patients (age range, 25 to 72 years) with previous signs of Lyme disease, current evidence of immunity to B. burgdorferi, and chronic neurologic symptoms with no other identifiable cause. Eight of the patients had been followed prospectively for 8 to 12 years after the onset of infection. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89 percent) had a mild encephalopathy that began 1 month to 14 years after the onset of the disease and was characterized by memory loss, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. Of the 24 patients, 14 had memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, and 18 had increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, evidence of intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi, or both. Nineteen of the 27 patients (70 percent) had polyneuropathy with radicular pain or distal paresthesias; all but two of these patients also had encephalopathy. In 16 patients electrophysiologic testing showed an axonal polyneuropathy. One patient had leukoencephalitis with asymmetric spastic diplegia, periventricular white-matter lesions, and intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi. Among the 27 patients, associated symptoms included fatigue (74 percent), headache (48 percent), arthritis (37 percent), and hearing loss (15 percent). At the time of examination, chronic neurologic abnormalities had been present from 3 months to 14 years, usually with little progression. Six months after a two-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily), 17 patients (63 percent) had improvement, 6 (22 percent) had improvement but then relapsed, and 4 (15 percent) had no change in their condition. CONCLUSIONS. Months to years after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi, patients with Lyme disease may have chronic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, or less commonly, leukoencephalitis. These chronic neurologic abnormalities usually improve with antibiotic therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91042902\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The treatment of patients allergic to insect stings with insect-venom injections has been shown to be 97 percent effective in reducing the risk of sting-induced anaphylaxis. However, the frequency of systemic reactions to subsequent stings in unimmunized adults with previous reactions is approximately 60 percent. To determine which factors, in addition to a history of reaction and evidence of venom-specific IgE antibody, predispose patients to future insect-sting reactions, we studied a venom-sensitive group of children who were deemed to be at relatively low risk for severe reactions; 28 percent of them received venom therapy. METHODS. We studied 242 children, 2 through 16 years of age, each of whom had had a systemic allergic reaction, affecting only the skin, to an insect sting. Each child had a positive skin-test reaction to one or more of five hymenopteran venoms. Sixty-eight children received immunotherapy with insect venom and 174 did not; about half were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and the rest were assigned on the basis of the patient's (or the parents') choice. The results of accidental stings during four years of observation were evaluated. RESULTS. In the treated group, 84 stings in 36 patients resulted in one systemic reaction (1.2 percent of stings). In contrast, 196 stings in 86 untreated children resulted in 18 systemic reactions (9.2 percent of stings, P less than 0.001). Sixteen of these 18 reactions were judged to be milder than the patient's reaction to the first sting, 2 were similar in severity, and none were more severe. CONCLUSIONS. These data confirm that immunotherapy with insect venom prevents recurrences of systemic reactions after subsequent insect stings. Because of the surprisingly low rate of reactions among untreated children, we could not identify any characteristics that were predictive of repeat reactions. Since only 9.2 percent of stings in the untreated children led to a systemic reaction and since there was no progression to a more severe reaction, we conclude that venom immunotherapy is unnecessary for most children who are allergic to insect stings.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the career paths of doctors who completed vocational training in the west of Scotland between 1968 and 1987 and their views on the hospital component of their training. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of the experience and opinions of vocationally trained doctors obtained from a postal questionnaire. SETTING--West of Scotland. SUBJECTS--1255 Doctors identified from Glasgow University records who had been vocationally trained in the west of Scotland between 1968 and 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Personal details; employment; jobs held currently; additional professional commitments; importance of hospital posts held in various specialties to respondents currently in general practice; and retrospective choice of hospital posts, based on subsequent experience. RESULTS--619 Responses were received, 543 initially and 76 after a letter of reminder, from a possible total of 974 (excluding 153 questionnaires returned by the post office and 128 returned because of misunderstanding between the name and address); the overall response rate was therefore 64%. 607/619 (98%) Respondents were employed at the time of the study, of whom 517/607 (85%) were in general practice. A third (202/609) had been unemployed at some point, significantly more of them women (122/243, 50% v 80/376, 21%; chi 2 = 54.8, p less than 0.001). 510/563 (91%) Respondents held one postgraduate qualification or more, and 284/612 (46%) had additional professional commitments. The hospital posts most commonly held were in obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry, paediatrics, and medicine. Medicine, obstetrics, paediatrics, and dermatology were considered to be the most relevant hospital specialties by those who had experience of them and were now in general practice. Although ophthalmology and ear, nose, and throat were not rated highly by these doctors, other respondents wished that they had held posts in these specialties (32 and 40 respectively). During the hospital training 354/475 (75%) respondents thought that they were looked on as a junior hospital doctor and not as a trainee for general practice. CONCLUSIONS--Most of those who had entered vocational training were in employment, and most were in general practice. According to them, the most beneficial hospital posts for vocational training are medicine, obstetrics, paediatrics, and dermatology. Trainees should be encouraged to attend clinics in gynaecology, ear, nose, and throat, and ophthalmology.\r"

  ".W": "A programme of antiepileptic treatment in a rural and semi-urban region in Kenya was assessed. Patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures were treated according to one of two simple drug protocols. Health workers screened cases reported by key informants in the community. From the 529 patients identified by health workers as having active seizures 302 patients aged 6-65 years were recruited by a psychiatrist for therapy with carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. Treatment was supervised largely by primary health workers, and the programme was monitored by a research team, which assessed the effectiveness of treatment. Of the 249 patients who completed the study, 53% became seizure-free in the second 6 months of therapy, and another 26% had substantially (50% or more reduction) fewer seizures than in the 6 months before therapy. The similarity of these findings to those obtained in newly diagnosed patients in the developed world, the low drop-out rate, the low rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects, and the acceptable compliance with therapy indicate that health workers can monitor therapy adequately. Most patients had had several years of delay before starting therapy for their epilepsy, yet they responded well--a finding that does not support the suggestion that the disorder becomes intractable if not treated early.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure to diagnostic x-rays and the risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma were studied within two prepaid health plans. Adult patients with leukemia (n = 565), NHL (n = 318), and multiple myeloma (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 1390), and over 25,000 x-ray procedures were abstracted from medical records. Dose response was evaluated by assigning each x-ray procedure a score based on estimated bone marrow dose. X-ray exposure was not associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignant conditions never linked to radiation (relative risk [RR], 0.66). For all other forms of leukemia combined (n = 358), there was a slight elevation in risk (RR, 1.17) but no evidence of a dose-response relationship when x-ray procedures near the time of diagnosis were excluded. Similarly, patients with NHL were exposed to diagnostic x-ray procedures more often than controls (RR, 1.32), but the RR fell to 0.99 when the exposure to diagnostic x-ray procedures within 2 years of diagnosis was ignored. For multiple myeloma, overall risk was not significantly high (RR, 1.14), but there was consistent evidence of increasing risk with increasing numbers of diagnostic x-ray procedures. These data suggest that persons with leukemia and NHL undergo x-ray procedures frequently just prior to diagnosis for conditions related to the development or natural history of their disease. There was little evidence that diagnostic x-ray procedures were causally associated with leukemia or NHL. The risk for multiple myeloma, however, was increased among those patients who were frequently exposed to x-rays.\r"
