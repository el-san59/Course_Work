  ".W": "Fecal occult blood testing for the detection of colon cancer remains controversial. We performed a mass screening program from January 24, 1988, to February 19, 1988, with intensive media promotion, including 121 minutes of televised air time. A total of 5,000 primary practitioners were notified by mail. Hemoccult-II tests were distributed to 156,000 individuals; 55,051 (35%) were returned. Ninety-five percent of the respondents were informed of the program by television. A total of 3,375 persons (6%) tested positive for fecal occult blood; of these, 2,469 (73%) informed the center that they saw their physician to initiate a work-up. Information from physicians regarding work-ups was returned on only 1,356 (55%) patients. Diagnostic tests numbered 2,227 (1.6 tests per patient). However, 5% had no testing, 16% had a repeat Hemoccult only, and 35% had neither a barium enema nor colonoscopy performed. Thirty-six colorectal cancers and 212 polyps were identified. The predictive value (i.e., number of cancers per number of patients who tested positive) increased directly by decade. Thirty-three of 36 patients (92%) with cancer underwent either a barium enema or colonoscopy versus only 185 of 438 (42%) patients with a \"negative\" work-up. Cancers found were carcinoma in situ in 10 patients (29%), Dukes A in 12 (35%), Dukes B in 4 (12%), and Dukes C in 8 (24%); distant metastases were not found in any participant. Thirty-six percent of the tumors were located in either the right or transverse colon. We conclude that: (1) Screening identified early cancers. All were potentially curable and 64% were limited to the bowel wall. (2) Massive Hemoccult distribution was possible over a short interval, but patient and physician compliance was disturbingly low. (3) Total colonic evaluation is mandatory, since at least 36% of tumors were beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope. (4) Many work-ups were unnecessary (repeat Hemoccults) or inadequate, indicating a need for physician education.\r"

This experiment studied the effect of somatostatin analogue therapy on the development of two structural parameters of post-resectional hyperplasia in rats subjected to 40% proximal small bowel resection. Octreotide acetate-treated rats failed to develop increased villus height (902 +/- 50 microns) relative to saline-treated rats (1,103 +/- 98 microns). Augmentation of residual intestinal weight was also significantly impaired in analogue-treated rats (92 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 5 mg/cm). We conclude that somatostatin analogue treatment during the early postoperative period does impair the growth of residual bowel in rats. These findings raise concern regarding the use of this drug for postoperative patients who have undergone massive small bowel resection in whom the process of post-resectional adaptation may be critical to allow sustenance with enteral nutrition.\r"

The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series. The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%). The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography. The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients. The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma. Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas. Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths. Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease. Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver.\r"

The actuarial 5-year survival for all 89 patients was 19%, with a median survival of 11.9 months. The 81 hospital survivors were analyzed in an effort to determine factors influencing long-term survival. Negative lymph nodes and the absence of blood vessel invasion both favored long-term survival. The strongest predictive factor was negative lymph node status with a median survival of 55.8 months, compared with 11 months with lymph nodes involved with tumor (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusions were also predictive, with patients receiving two or fewer units having a median survival of 24.7 months, compared with 10.2 months for those receiving three or more units (p less than 0.05). The most important determinant of long-term survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer is biology of the tumor (lymph node status, blood vessel invasion). However, performance of the resection (units of blood transfused) also appears to be an important factor influencing survival.\r"

  ".W": "The topical application of acidified (pH 1.2) bile acids to acid-peptic-secreting gastric mucosa increases mucosal blood flow, an important protective event because, when it is blunted, gross mucosal injury occurs. The mediators of this response are unknown. The current study examined the potential roles of luminal pH, luminal bile acid concentration, and, indirectly, endogenous prostaglandin generation in groups of dogs prepared with ex vivo chambered wedges of proximal gastric wall. Parameters evaluated included H+ fluxes, mucosal blood flow using radiolabeled microspheres, and the severity of gross mucosal injury induced at high and low intraluminal pH (7 and 1.2), at differing concentrations of bile acid (0, 2.5, 5.0 mM), in the presence of indomethacin pretreatment with or without concomitant close intra-arterial infusion of prostacyclin. The results indicate that topical bile acids increase mucosal blood flow in proportion to their capacity to induce H+ loss. This response is blunted (but not ablated) by indomethacin, resulting in gross mucosal injury, effects that are reversed by prostacyclin infusion. Thus, in large part, endogenous prostaglandins are its likely mediators.\r"

A total of 431 serial hepatic biopsies in 58 consecutive adult patients were obtained. The average number of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in each portal tract were counted. The area of each portal tract was determined using an optical micrometer. Rejection was confirmed by an independent investigator using both clinical and histologic criteria. Using a backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, we found that eosinophils were the only variable predictive of rejection. Using this model, the probability of having rejection on a single biopsy can be determined with greater than 90% accuracy.\r"

Comparison of the BAR with combined suture and stapled controls revealed no significant differences in wound complication, abscess rate, bleeding, anastomotic leaks, ileus, obstruction, or deaths. There were no differences in return of bowel function, return to normal diet, or hospital stay. Intraoperative difficulties occurred in 46 BAR patients (17%), and this was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than for sutured (3%) but not for stapled anastomoses (11%). The occurrence of these problems did not adversely effect the outcome. The data suggest that the BAR is a safe, satisfactory alternative to sutured or stapled colorectal anastomoses.\r"

The glucose, insulin, and C peptide responses to oral glucose post-shunt were exaggerated but comparable to preoperative values. Compared with preoperative values, the fasting molar ratio of C peptide to insulin postoperatively had increased 40% (6.0 +/- 1.2 versus 8.4 +/- 0.7), indicating improved hepatic function. These results suggest that extrahepatic portosystemic shunting secondary to spontaneous splanchnic collaterals plays little or no role in the hyperinsulinemia of cirrhosis. It appears that decreased hepatic degradation of insulin in these patients is secondary to hepatocellular dysfunction rather than a result of shunting of portal blood around the liver.\r"

The gastric bypass favorably affected non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and physical and role functioning. In the most recent 157 patients, our studies were extended to study the effects of the gastric bypass on mental health. The significant improvements in mental health indices that were observed 6 and 12 months after surgery eroded by the end of 2 years. This return of the mental health indices to the preoperative status, plus the late occurrence of 3 suicides and 2 deaths from alcohol abuse among the total 462 patients, suggest that long-term follow-up and continued emotional support are essential ingredients for successful bariatric surgery.\r"

Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period. Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting. These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low. The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion. Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients. All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist. Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual. The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices.\r"

The distribution and content of substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) in the region of the canine gastroesophageal junction was also studied. SP and NKA stimulated a linear dose-dependent contraction of the LES after intra-arterial administration. Neurokinin B (NKB) failed to stimulate an increase in LES pressure (LESP). SP was characterized by an immediate but short-lived contraction followed by a period of relaxation. NKA stimulated a potent LES contraction that was slow in onset but long-lasting. On an equimolar basis, both SP and NKA were approximately 100 times more potent LES stimulants than bethanechol or phenylephrine. Pretreatment with atropine (muscarinic blockade) or tetrodotoxin (neural blockade) inhibited the effect produced by SP. NKA appeared to stimulate LES contraction independent of neural or cholinergic mechanisms. Radioimmunoassay revealed a regional variation in tachykinin content in the gastroesophageal junction. Ganglia, cell bodies, nerve fascicles, and neurites stained specifically for both SP and NKA. The variable effects, potencies, and mechanisms of action observed in this study suggest the presence of specific tachykinin receptor subtypes in the gastroesophageal junction. Both SP and NKA were found to have a broad neural distribution in this region. These findings suggest that the tachykinins may play an important role in neuroregulation of LES smooth muscle.\r"

In 17 consecutive patients, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was made by immunophenotyping snap-frozen endoscopic biopsy specimens. All neoplasms were B-cell lymphomas. Pan B surface marker antigens were present in all patients. Levels of Ki-67, a nuclear marker of tumor proliferation, were greater than 45% in two of the four patients who died after progression of their lymphoma. All patients alive had Ki-67 levels of less than 30%. A lower proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, appears to be associated with better prognosis. Ten of 11 patients treated by resection prior to chemotherapy had no complications. Immunophenotyping is the key in the differential diagnosis when considering malignant lymphoma with gastric carcinoma and benign conditions such as pseudolymphoma.\r"

  ".U": "91103389\r", 
  ".W": "Long-term administration of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, is complicated by gallstone formation. Somatostatin is known to inhibit hepatic bile secretion and gallbladder emptying. However, the effect of octreotide on gallbladder bile composition remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that octretide would alter hepatic bile composition and cause gallbladder stasis, thereby increasing gallbladder bile solute concentrations. Fourteen control prairie dogs received daily saline injections, whereas 10 animals received 1 micrograms of octreotide subcutaneously three times per day for 5 days. Cholecystectomy and common bile duct cannulation were then performed. Octreotide increased hepatic bile concentrations of bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.05), and total protein (p less than 0.01). Rsa, an index of gallbladder stasis, was decreased (p less than 0.01) in the octreotide group. Gallbladder bile total calcium (p less than 0.05), bilirubin monoglucuronide (p less than 0.05), total bilirubin (p less than 0.01), total protein (p less than 0.05), and total lipids (p less than 0.05) were increased in the octreotide group. Animals receiving octreotide also had decreased hepatic (p less than 0.05) and gallbladder (p less than 0.001) bile pH. No differences in cholesterol saturation index were observed. These data suggest that in the prairie dog, octreotide (1) alters hepatic bile composition, (2) causes gallbladder stasis, and (3) increases gallbladder bile calcium, bilirubin, protein, lipid, and hydrogen ion concentrations. We conclude that octreotide causes alterations in gallbladder bile composition that increase the likelihood of cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate precipitation.\r"

Three minutes after the intraportal injection of iodine 125 (125I)-labeled SRIF-14, 16.0 +/- 2.0% of the injected dose is localized to the liver. In the presence of unlabeled SRIF-14, hepatic uptake can be decreased by 68%. Five minutes after the intraportal injection of 125I-SRIF-14, 9.5 +/- 1.4% of the tracer is localized to the liver, more than any other organ tested. Serial collections of bile reveal peak radioactivity at between 10 and 20 minutes. Simultaneous administration of unlabeled SRIF-14 decreases biliary radioactivity by 40%. HPLC analysis of radioactive bile reveals a chromatographic profile similar to that of intact SRIF and is 73% immunoprecipitable by an anti-SRIF antibody. Pretreatment with chloroquine, a lysosomal enzyme inhibitor, does not significantly decrease biliary radioactivity. We conclude that the data are consistent with saturable hepatic uptake and predominantly nonlysosomal transcellular transport.\r"

Infected pancreatic necrosis was demonstrated in 27 of the 38 patients (71%) with pancreatic necrosis and was treated by open drainage, yielding a mortality rate of 15%. All 11 patients with demonstrated sterile pancreatic necrosis, including 6 with pulmonary and renal insufficiency, were successfully treated without surgery. Pancreatic necrosis occurs in approximately 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis and is necessary for the development of secondary pancreatic infection. However, pancreatic necrosis by itself, even when accompanied by organ failure, is not an absolute indication for surgery. A trial of medical treatment for all patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis is in order.\r"

  ".W": "Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings was performed in 40 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (35 head, 5 body) whose tumors had been selected as potentially resectable by computed tomographic (CT) findings. Saline (100 mL) was instilled and aspirated at laparoscopy in 27 patients and at laparotomy in 13. Malignant cells were found in the peritoneal washings in 12 of 40 patients (30%): 29% in cancers of the pancreatic head versus 40% in the body; 33% at laparoscopy versus 23% at laparotomy; and in 4 of 8 patients with ascites versus 8 of 32 without ascites. The cytology was positive in 6 of 8 patients (75%) who had a prior percutaneous needle biopsy versus 6 of 32 (19%) of those who did not (p less than 0.01). Liver metastases were found in six patients, all with negative cytology. One of 10 pancreatic head cancers with positive cytology was resectable versus 13 of 25 with negative cytology (p less than 0.05). Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative cytology. We conclude that (1) pancreatic cancer sheds malignant cells into the peritoneum early and commonly; (2) laparoscopic lavage is an effective means of cytologic study; (3) ascites is not a precondition for cytologic study, nor does its presence necessarily imply carcinomatosis; (4) intraperitoneal spread of cancer cells may be promoted by tumor biopsy; (5) cytologic findings provide an additional index of resectability; and (6) cytologic findings appear to correlate with duration of survival. This study shows that even \"localized\" pancreatic cancer is often not contained and suggests caution with biopsy of potentially curable lesions.\r"

This study evaluates the effect of erythromycin, metoclopramide, and motilin on delayed gastric emptying in four dogs after Roux-Y antrectomy. Solid food gastric emptying was measured using a radionuclide technique. Study groups were: (1) saline control; (2) erythromycin 1 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour; (3) erythromycin 3 mg/kg by mouth 45 minutes prior to feeding; (4) metoclopramide 0.6 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour; and (5) motilin 500 ng/kg intravenously over 1 hour. After Roux-Y antrectomy, saline control dogs had 73% +/- 5% (SEM) gastric retention at 2 hours. After intravenous and oral erythromycin, gastric emptying improved at 2 hours to 27% +/- 6% and 39% +/- 5% (p less than 0.01 compared with control). Erythromycin intravenously and by mouth improved gastric emptying compared with metoclopramide (64% +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Motilin enhanced gastric emptying to a similar degree as erythromycin, with a 2-hour gastric retention of 37% +/- 4% (NS). Erythromycin improved gastric emptying in dogs with severe Roux-Y gastroparesis and may have clinical application.\r"

An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients. Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one. Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program. In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week. Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease. Appropriate training in laparoscopic surgery is necessary in order to avoid operative complications.\r"

The remaining body and tail of the pancreas were totally obstructed. After obstruction for a mean of 22 (range: 6 to 42) days, one of three anastomoses was performed: (1) inversion pancreatogastrostomy with two layers of sutures; (2) a similar inversion pancreatojejunostomy to the side of a Roux-Y jejunal loop; or (3) pancreatojejunostomy in which the major duct was joined to the jejunal mucosa with interrupted sutures. Six animals were kept for controls. Anastomotic patency was assessed after 8 to 12 weeks by pancreatography, with minimal pressures to achieve anastomotic flow recorded. Weight trends were consistent with anastomotic status. The eight dogs with duct-to-mucosa sutures clearly achieved superior anastomotic patency.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is recognized that some other lesion may be the cause, a presumptive diagnosis of Klatskin tumor is usually made when a focal stenotic lesion of the common hepatic duct is seen on a cholangiogram of a jaundiced patient. Biopsy is so often nondiagnostic that decisions about therapy are usually made on the basis of the imaging tests and lack of evidence for some other disease. Because the accuracy and consequences of this strategy have never been tested, we contrasted the preoperative diagnosis of Klatskin tumor with the final diagnosis in 98 consecutive patients treated from 1985 to 1990. Preoperative investigations included ultrasound and computed tomographic scans, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and angiography. Sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas of the bile duct were correctly diagnosed in 68 cases. The final diagnosis was other than a sclerosing adenocarcinoma in 30 (31%) cases. There were 5 papillary bile duct carcinomas, 12 gallbladder carcinomas invading the bile duct, 5 metastatic tumors to the bile duct, 2 cases of Mirizzi syndrome, 3 granulomas, and 3 cases of idiopathic benign focal stenosis. Patients with papillary adenocarcinomas had an extensive filling defect of the duct, which was often thought to be unresectable. However, four of these five lesions could be completely excised, and the tumor was confined to the duct wall in all four. The outcome of surgical treatment of the other eight patients with benign lesions was good in most cases. These findings demonstrate the pitfalls of assuming that a focal stenosis of the hepatic duct represents a sclerosing adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis is much less specific than is generally thought, so there is considerable opportunity for mismanaging such patients.\r"

The median duration of operation was 3 hours and 20 minutes, although 25% of the procedures required 4 or more hours. There was no postoperative mortality and no early reoperations. Among the six patients with postoperative complications, one rebled from the ulcer and two developed prolonged gastric atony. At the time of follow-up (median, 2.9 years), 48 of the patients were alive and 4 had died of non-ulcer causes. No patient had significant postvagotomy sequelae. Ulcer recurrence was documented in six patients, and three required reoperation. Proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe, effective therapy for bleeding duodenal ulcer. Because of the length of the operation, it should be restricted to low-risk patients who are hemodynamically stable at the time of operation.\r"

Splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease who develop massive splenomegaly with accompanying hypersplenism and/or mechanical pressure symptoms. The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure. Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy. There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications. Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months). No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease. Eight patients have died since surgery. All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy. The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to substantiate whether partial splenectomy is indeed the treatment of choice for splenomegaly associated with Gaucher's disease.\r"

A number of potential risk factors for the development of vascular thrombosis were evaluated with only children, weight less than 10 kg, and cold ischemia time found to be significant. The clinical presentation included fulminant hepatic failure, allograft dysfunction, biliary sepsis, and screening ultrasound. Duplex ultrasonography was diagnostic in nearly all cases. Therapeutic modalities included revascularization, revascularization followed by retransplantation, retransplantation alone, and observation. Five cases of hepatic artery rupture occurred in four patients. Infectious arteritis was present in four patients. The 6-month actuarial survival in patients with vascular complications was 70%. Early diagnosis is critical for graft salvage, with surgical intervention the mainstay of therapy.\r"

We investigated the effects of the trypsin inhibitor FOY-305 (an agent that stimulates endogenous cholecystokinin) on pancreatic regeneration after partial pancreatectomy in rats. FOY-305 or water was administered for either 13 days or 27 days by gavage feeding, after sham operation or partial pancreatectomy (n = 6 to 8 animals per group). FOY-305 stimulated hypertrophy of the pancreatic remnant at 13 days; prolonged treatment for 27 days produced both hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The magnitude of pancreatic growth after FOY-305 administration was significantly greater at 27 days in the pancreatic remnant than growth of the equivalent pancreatic segment (duodenal and parabiliary) in sham-operated rats treated with FOY-305. Our results suggest that endogenous cholecystokinin released by FOY-305 stimulates regeneration after partial pancreatectomy. The pancreatic remnant is more sensitive to trophic stimulation in comparison to the normal pancreas. FOY-305 may be a useful agent in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency after extensive subtotal pancreatectomy or chronic pancreatitis.\r"

Fifty-four patients had stapled IPAA with anal pursestrings placed transabdominally without mucosectomy (no manipulation). Patients with transabdominal anal pursestring placement and stapled IPAA without mucosectomy had a higher mean maximum anal resting pressure than patients who had endoanal manipulation.

The management of patients with high-grade dysplasia without evidence of carcinoma remains controversial. Esophagectomy is proposed by some investigators, whereas others favor follow-up endoscopy and biopsy until microinvasive malignancy is documented. We reviewed our experience with nine patients referred with high-grade dysplasia on endoscopic biopsies without evidence of carcinoma. Eight patients had the columnar lining extending orad from the cardia, and one patient had heterotopic columnar epithelium in the cervical esophagus. All were white men ranging in age from 19 to 76 years (median: 47 years). Eight patients underwent esophagectomy with colon interposition. A sleeve resection of the cervical esophagus was done in one patient. Multifocal carcinoma was found in three patients, all of whom had severe dysplastic changes throughout the columnar lining. The patient with heterotopic columnar epithelium had microinvasive carcinoma. All four patients with carcinoma had negative nodes and are long-term survivors. No carcinoma was found in the resected specimens of the remaining five patients. High-grade dysplasia is an important marker of malignancy in patients with a columnar-lined esophagus. Esophagectomy is indicated in suitable candidates since carcinoma was found in 45% of our patients.\r"

A commercial imported fire ant whole body extract, known from RAST and skin test data to be potent, was found to contain 10.3 micrograms of Sol i III per milliliter. This was comparable to the content of an extract freshly prepared in our laboratory. The immunoassay detected Sol i III in an extract of fire ant abdomens, but not in head and thorax extract. The amount of imported fire ant venom in a potent whole body extract appears to be sufficient to provide possible protection for patients receiving it as immunotherapy, although this can only be verified by controlled clinical trials with intentional sting challenges.\r"

Endotoxin alone did not induce any immediate skin response; LPS had a synergistic effect on the HDM skin response both in terms of flare [27.4 +/- 2.8 mm, 26.6 +/- 3.3 mm, 28.1 +/- 2.5 mm versus 20.7 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively in presence of LPS 1 (P less than .02), 10 (P less than .05), 100 (P less than .01) micrograms/mL] and wheal response [6.4 +/- 1.0 mm, in presence of LPS 100 micrograms/mL versus 4.9 +/- 1.1 mm in absence of LPS (P less than .05)]. On the other hand, a possible LPS synergistic action on the histamine skin response was evaluated in ten normal subjects but the results were not significant. These findings show that LPS increases the allergy skin response probably due to a mechanism including a potentiation of the IgE receptor activation rather than an increase of the skin response to the release mediators.\r"

Both methods detected a decongestant response to both drugs, and the symptom of congestion correlated with the measured nasal airway area. Rhinoscopic measurement of cross sectional nasal airway area is an objective method that may be used to complement other methods for evaluation of nasal patency.\r"

  ".W": "We compared emergency room visits for the treatment of asthma in two large downtown teaching hospitals: one in Auckland, New Zealand and one in Toronto, Canada. We wished to determine whether the differences in asthma mortality between New Zealand and Canada were reflected in different patterns of emergency room use or physician management. Emergency room use during the past decade was enumerated in both hospitals, and charts containing the sole diagnosis of asthma were reviewed in detail for a defined study period in 1986. In both Toronto and Auckland, the number of emergency visits for asthma had increased significantly in the past decade (P less than .015 but the rate of rise was significantly higher in Auckland (P less than .05). In Auckland, 27% of asthmatics were admitted whereas in Toronto significantly fewer (16%) were admitted (P less than .0005). Objective measures of pulmonary function were documented more frequently by emergency room physicians in New Zealand than in Canada (90% versus 48%; P less than .0005). Pulmonary function measurement was primarily by peak flow meter in Auckland and most commonly by spirometer in Toronto so that pulmonary function measurements could not be compared directly between centers. In both centers, however, admitted patients had significantly lower pulmonary function indices than discharged patients. In New Zealand, mean peak flow was 38% of the predicted value among all asthmatics assessed; in Toronto, mean FEV1 was 47% of predicted. In Toronto, pulmonary function measurements were most likely to be missing among presumably healthier discharged patients. Pulse rate, respiratory rate, and pulsus paradoxus were documented more consistently in Auckland than in Toronto.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These medications differ considerably from one another in some aspects of basic pharmacology and in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. An understanding of these differences will facilitate their optimal clinical usage. The second-generation H1-receptor antagonists are replacing the first generation H1-receptor antagonists in the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and in relieving pruritus in patients with urticaria. They have a mild beneficial effect in patients with chronic asthma. They have not supplanted the first generation H1-receptor antagonists in atopic dermatitis treatment or as adjunctive treatment of pruritus and other symptoms in patients with anaphylaxis.\r"

SETTING: Tennessee Medicaid program. PARTICIPANTS: Medicaid enrollees 65 years of age or older were included in the study. The 1415 case patients had been hospitalized for confirmed peptic ulcer disease at some point from 1984 through 1986. The 7063 control persons represented a stratified random sample of other Medicaid enrollees. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated relative risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease among current users of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, compared with that among nonusers, was 4.1 (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.7). For current users, the risk increased with increasing dose, from a relative risk of 2.8 (CI, 1.8 to 4.3) for the lowest to a relative risk of 8.0 (CI, 4.4 to 14.8) for the highest dose category. The risk was greatest in the first month of use (relative risk, 7.2; CI, 4.9 to 10.5). If the association is fully causal, 29% of peptic ulcers in the study sample resulted from the use of these drugs, and the excess risk associated with such use was 17.4 hospitalizations for ulcer disease per 1000 person-years of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These data support other findings indicating that a clinically significant risk for serious ulcer disease is associated with the use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data show that this risk increases with dose and recency of use and that use of these drugs may be responsible for a large proportion of peptic ulcer disease among elderly persons.\r"

SETTING: University hospital specializing in chest diseases. PATIENTS: We studied 102 patients with pleural disease, the cause of which had not been determined after initial investigation, including thoracentesis and needle biopsy. Eighty-six patients had pleural effusion, 11 had pleural mass, and 5 had pleural effusion in association with a known primary lung carcinoma. INTERVENTION: All patients had thoracoscopy under local anesthesia with mild sedation. Visually directed biopsies were done of parietal pleura. MEASUREMENTS: We recorded clinical characteristics, laboratory data, findings and duration of thoracoscopy, and any complications associated with the procedure. Hospital and clinic follow-up records were reviewed, and patients were contacted by telephone 12 and 24 months after thoracoscopy to assess their health status. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred and four thoracoscopies were done in 102 patients. A definitive diagnosis was established in 95 patients: 42 had malignant pleural disease and 53 had benign pleural disease. A diagnosis of benign pleural disease using thoracoscopy could not be confirmed in the remaining 7 patients because of insufficient follow-up information. Overall, thoracoscopy was 96% accurate with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 93% for the diagnosis of pleural malignancy. Thoracoscopy was well tolerated under local anesthesia and entailed hospitalization for less than 24 hours in most cases. No deaths occurred, although 1.9% of patients had major complications, and 5.5% had minor complications. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pleural disease remaining undiagnosed after usual initial investigation, thoracoscopy done under local anesthesia is a rapid, safe, and well-tolerated procedure with an excellent diagnostic yield that is equivalent to that of thoracotomy.\r"

MEASUREMENTS: Antibodies to B. burgdorferi were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 5 days with B. burgdorferi, recall antigens, or pokeweed mitogen was measured by radioactive thymidine uptake. RESULTS: Lymphocytes from 11 patients with Lyme disease, 8 healthy seronegative controls, and two newborns showed elevated responses when stimulated with B. burgdorferi. When a patient and a control were studied on the same day, the patient's lymphocyte response to B. burgdorferi exceeded the control's in only 5 of 12 cases. Lymphocytes from both patients and controls responded to B. burgdorferi isolates from three different sources. CONCLUSIONS: Heightened lymphocyte responses to B. burgdorferi are found in patients with Lyme disease but elevated responses also frequently occur in healthy controls. At present, the interpretation of a positive lymphocyte response to B. burgdorferi would be difficult in ambiguous clinical situations.\r"

PATIENTS: Of 5824 patients with gallstones, 19% were eligible; 711 patients were treated. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy as well as adjuvant therapy with bile acids. RESULTS: Lithotripsy was done in three ways, using a water-tank lithotriptor (group A), a water-cushion lithotriptor at low energy levels (group B), and a water-cushion lithotriptor at high energy levels (group C). The rate of complete fragment clearance 9 to 12 months after lithotripsy was done differed significantly among the three groups: Among patients with single stones of 20 mm or less in diameter, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 76%; for group B, it was 60%; and for group C, it was 83% (P = 0.03). Among patients with single stones of 21 to 30 mm, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 63%; for group B, it was 32%; and for group C, it was 58% (P less than 0.005). Among patients with two or three stones, the rate of fragment clearance for group A was 38%; for group B, it was 16%; and for group C, it was 46% (P = 0.01). Patients with fragments of 3 mm or less 24 hours after lithotripsy was done showed a higher probability of fragment disappearance than did those with larger fragments (P less than 0.001). The clearance rate was higher in patients who were compliant than in those who were noncompliant with bile acid therapy (P less than 0.001). Adverse effects included liver hematoma in 1 patients, biliary pain attacks in 253 patients (36%), mild biliary pancreatitis in 13 patients (2%), and cholestasis in 7 patients (1%). Elective cholecystectomy was done in 16 patients (2%), and endoscopic sphincterotomy was done in 4 patients (1%). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of complete disappearance of stones after shock wave therapy depends on the size and the number of the initial stones, the diameter of the largest fragment, and the mode of shock wave treatment. Adjuvant therapy with bile acids appears to be important for complete fragment clearance.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 1990) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: In addition to several reviews, studies that evaluated the diagnostic technology of pulmonary embolism were selected. Preference was given to studies with a prospective design, particularly those done within the past decade. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were assessed independently by three unblinded observers. Data were chosen to describe the efficacy of diagnostic technology on the basis of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, and predictive value. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: A normal lung scan or pulmonary angiogram rules out the diagnosis of clinically important pulmonary embolism with at least 95% certainty. Lung scan interpretations indicating high or low probability have approximately a 15% error in diagnosing or ruling out pulmonary embolism. The accuracy of either scan result improves when the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism matches the lung scan result. Serial impedance plethysmography of the lower extremities may exclude thromboembolism with 95% certainty in patients without high-probability lung scan results or cardiopulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clinical suspicion and the results of the lung scan and impedance plethysmography appear to offer acceptable diagnostic accuracy in evaluating many patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The usefulness of this approach for patients with cardiopulmonary disease is still unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence has accumulated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause clinically important gastroduodenal ulcers. The pathogenesis, which involves the impairment of mucosal resistance to injury in an acid-peptic environment, is multifactorial and controversial. Ulcers caused by NSAIDs can occur either in mucosa inflamed because of infection with Helicobacter pylori or in histologically normal mucosa. The use of these drugs has been linked to an unexpectedly high incidence of ulcer complications, and a history of peptic ulcer disease is common in such cases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs thus appear both to exacerbate an underlying peptic diathesis and to cause de novo ulcers. The association between the use of these drugs and ulcer complications is supported by ulcer prevalence data from cross-sectional studies, and by data from case-controlled and cohort studies, and from randomized, experimental trials. Drug-induced gastric ulcers have been prevented by misoprostol, but not by H2 blocker therapy. Several therapies have been reported to promote ulcer healing despite continued use of NSAIDs, but adequate controlled trials have not been done. Small gastric and duodenal ulcers readily heal, whereas larger gastric ulcers require vigorous and prolonged therapy. The relative efficacies of various therapies in preventing ulcers, healing ulcers, or preventing complications remain to be established.\r"

Four infants were sufficiently ill to require admission to hospital and further investigations: one with encephalitis and three with gross hepatosplenomegaly, two of whom had evidence of simultaneous infection with another herpes-virus. The remaining four infants had an illness compatible with roseola infantum, although this diagnosis had not been made clinically. Sera from two of those infants with rash had been sent for analysis to exclude rubella because the infants' mothers were pregnant. The other two had received antibiotics when febrile, and the subsequent appearance of the roseola rash had raised the possibility of antibiotic allergy. The data suggest that there are clinical syndromes in addition to roseola infantum associated with the presence of IgM anti-HHV6, in which serological screening for evidence of acute HHV6 infection may be useful.\r"

During the evaluation time (median 30 months) two patients died of AIDS and 32 patients (60%) deteriorated when assessed by the Brodt-Helm classification. Nineteen patients (37%) had decreased absolute helper cell counts (less than 500 CD4 positive cells/microliters), and 45 patients (87%) had reduced helper cell to lymphocyte ratios (less than 0.35). HIV-1 was isolated from peripheral lymphocytes in 29 of 46 patients. As the disease progressed the number of positive viral cultures increased. Considerable progression of the HIV infection was seen in haemophilic children and adolescents during the median evaluation period of 30 months. The transition from symptomless HIV infection to immunodeficiency was easily recognised. A lowered ratio of helper cells to lymphocytes seems to be a useful marker of the beginning of the deterioration of the immune system.\r"

The rectal temperature of immunised babies was significantly higher than non-immunised babies from two hours into the night. We also found that there were considerable individual variations in the extent of disturbance of temperature rhythm. They were not correlated with thermal environment. There is no reason to suppose that these mild physiological responses to immunisation are in any way harmful.\r"

Breast fed infants had more periods of growth below the 25th centile than expected. These differences are unlikely to be useful in the prediction of which babies are likely to die from SIDS as there are frequent episodes of poor growth in infants who do not die.\r"

The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years.\r"

Eight children died during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and of the 23 survivors, three further children had subsequently died from asthma. Seventeen children were followed up for more than a year after IPPV. Sixteen still had symptoms of asthma and over half had symptoms every day. Ten cooperated with pulmonary function tests: mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 83% of predicted and geometric mean provocative histamine concentration (PC20) was 2.1 mg/ml. Since the follow up study a fourth patient had died from asthma. IPPV continues to be required for a small number of asthmatic children each year. The survivors remain a high risk group with significant continuing morbidity and mortality.\r"

Of the 732 children studied, 651 (90%) are still alive, and hence cerebral palsy must be regarded as a condition with which people live rather than a condition of which they die. Survival varies considerably among the different diagnostic groups: those suffering from spasic quadriplegia, dyskinetic and 'mixed' cerebral palsy are most severely affected. Our evidence suggests that, though immobility and severe mental subnormality are the strongest predictors of mortality in children with cerebral palsy, the majority of even the most severely affected patients survive to adulthood. It is therefore appropriate to plan for their survival by funding and evaluating programmes to maximise health, independence, and quality of life.\r"

Control assessed by glycated haemoglobin was significantly lower in children on human isophane insulin, but fasting blood glucose and fructosamine concentrations and the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia were similar on both regimens. In five children on twice daily insulin regimens, insulin profiles throughout a 24 hour period demonstrated greater variability on lente compared with isophane insulin despite identically administered insulin doses. A questionnaire completed at the end of the study showed that two thirds of the children and/or their parents preferred the isophane insulin, and they gave perceived improvement of metabolic control as the major reason for their choice.\r"

In the first, a standard metre rod was used to spot check the accuracy of installation of 230 measuring instruments in one health district in Wessex, UK. The readings obtained ranged from 90.0 to 108.5 cm and showed the urgent need for the positioning of instruments to be regularly checked. In a second study, to examine the reproducibility of height measurement, two experienced observers measured 10 young children (106.0 to 152.0 cm), three times on five instruments of different design. The observations were blind and in random order. The estimated standard deviation for a single height measurement was generally in the range 0.2-0.3 cm. Over 95% of the variance was attributable to the child, very little to the instrument or observer. Finally, the conditions of the second study were modified to examine the effect on reproducibility of non-blind and non-randomised measurements, as usually occurs in the clinic. A lower but inevitably false estimate of the error was obtained. It is recommended that the error of height measurement, appropriately established and expressed in simple terms, be stated in every published growth study.\r"

  ".W": "To find out whether measurements of height made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for use in routine screening of children we carried out an interobserver and intraobserver reliability study. Height measurements were made on a group of 10 children aged 3 years old and 10 aged 4.5 years old by two sets of four health visitors. They used a Microtoise or wall chart and the measurements were compared with those made by a trained auxologist with a Harpenden stadiometer. For a single assessment of height both pieces of equipment gave reasonably accurate results. In a child aged 3 years, with height measured on the Microtoise as 100 cm, the true height could be expected--with 95% probability--to lie between 99.2 cm-101.8 cm. At the age of 4.5 years, if the measurement was 110 cm, the child's true height could be expected to lie between 108.9 cm and 111.9 cm. The narrowest confidence interval for the growth rate from 3 to 4.5 years was achieved with the Microtoise, taking the mean of three measurements. We conclude that measurements made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for routine screening of height, and the use of such measurements for the calculation of height velocity could be improved by more structured training.\r"

Four of the index subjects but none of the control subjects were below the normal range. The differences between groups on other tests of cognitive and motor skills were not significant, though those with Shwachman syndrome tended to have the lowest scores. There was no evidence that those with Shwachman syndrome had more behavioural difficulties than the control subjects. We suggest that the intellectual difficulties of patients with Shwachman syndrome may be of neurological rather than social origin and that they may originate before birth.\r"

Of the 738 with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: recurrent tumour, 550 (74%), a second primary tumour, 61 (8%), a medical condition related to treatment of the tumour, 49 (7%), an traumatic death unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 34 (5%), finally, any other cause unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 44 (6%). Less than 10% of five year survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, or a soft tissue sarcoma died of recurrent tumour during the next 15 years, while more than 25% of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's tumour died of recurrent tumour during the corresponding period. Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The two counties were very similar in many ways, including low smoking rates, until a steel mill constructed during WW II caused substantial CAP in one of them. Subsequent differences in mortality rates from both respiratory cancer and NMRD are striking. A third county, similar to many counties outside Utah, was included in the analysis for comparison. In one county, 30-40% of the respiratory cancer and NMRD deaths were attributable to CAP. In this county, NMRD deaths (but not respiratory cancer deaths) were slightly more frequent than in Salt Lake County where smoking rates were twice as high.\r"

  ".W": "A k-x-ray fluorescence (K-XRF) instrument that can measure in vivo bone lead at low levels was used on a population of 34 adults with no known history of excessive lead exposure. A questionnaire that gathered information relevant to occupational and environmental lead exposure was administered prior to the measurement. A 30-min measurement that produced an average estimated uncertainty of 6 mcg lead/g bone mineral was taken at the mid-tibial diaphysis for each subject. Eighteen subjects had bone lead levels below the measurement uncertainty. The remainder had bone lead levels ranging up to 21 mcg lead/g bone mineral. Bone lead levels were greater among older subjects. Among young adult subjects, bone lead levels greater than the measurement uncertainty were confined entirely to subjects who had grown up in housing that was estimated to have been build prior to 1955. Such a childhood environment is at high risk of fostering exposure to biologically absorbable lead through ingestion of lead paint-contaminated dust and lead pipe-contaminated water. We conclude that the K-XRF technique has the potential to distinguish between low levels of lead burden in epidemiologic studies.\r"

This inconsistency is seen for both prenatal exposure and exposure in the preschool years. The primary outcome measures in most reports are indices of cognitive development, including IQ. Verbal skills may be particularly vulnerable to toxic insult. The fact that 2 y of age is both a time of peak exposure and also a time of rapid language development suggests that this may be a critical period for such an effect. The later prenatal and early infancy period, at which time the nervous system is developing rapidly, may also be critical exposure period. We examined the relationship of maternal and cord blood lead (PbB) at birth and venous PbB at 6 mo, 2 y, and 3 y with language measures at 1, 2, and 3 y of age. The sample consisted of disadvantaged urban children. Multivariate analyses revealed no statistically significant relationship of either prenatal PbB or early preschool PbB with language measures after control of cofactors. Supplementary partial correlations revealed a marginal relationship of cord PbB and mean length of utterance (MLU), which describes a child's ability to form meaningful word combinations. Because this analysis was one of a large number of analyses with both positive and negative regression coefficients, the possibility that this was a chance effect was considered. If there is an effect of low-level lead exposure on language development, that effect is not robust.\r"

In maternal blood, 80% of the tot-Hg was found to be methylated in contrast to 98% in cord blood. Concentrations of Me-Hg in maternal and cord blood were significantly correlated, and the mean ratio between fetal and maternal blood Me-Hg was 1.9. Concentrations of Me-Hg in cord blood were closely related to the marine food intake of the mothers. Eighty-four percent of the mothers had blood concentrations of Me-Hg above 0.11 mumol/l (23 micrograms/l), which corresponds to the provisional limit of tolerable intake set by the World Health Organization. This indicates that the majority of the pregnant woman have an unacceptable high intake of methyl mercury.\r"

  ".W": "Volatile N-nitrosamines are very potent carcinogens. They can be approximately 5 million times more powerful than saccharin. One of two principal methods is generally used when assaying rubber products for nitrosamine content: (1) the German method (aqueous extraction) or (2) the U.S. method (dichloromethane extraction). When 16 types of baby-bottle nipples and children's pacifiers were tested recently, relatively high levels of nitramines, nitrosamines, and nitrosatable precursors were found. Eighty-one percent failed to meet the strict Dutch standards (based on the German method), but only 37.5% would have been banned according to U.S. regulations, which ignore nitrosatable-precursor content. Up to one-third of the nitrosamines present in a rubber nipple may migrate into the milk in the bottle within a few hours. Transfer into infant formula may exceed 40%, and transfer into saliva may be even higher. Thus, a highly contaminated nipple may cause a 5-kg infant who drinks 1 l/d to ingest approximately 2 micrograms/kg body weight.d of nitrosamines. To this, add any exposure resulting from pacifier use or from in vivo nitrosation of precursors. Therefore, daily exposure of infants may, in the worst case, conceivably reach 4-5 micrograms/kg body weight.d. Entire average daily exposure of an American adult to volatile nitrosamines from major sources is estimated to be less than 0.05 micrograms/kg body weight.d. Infants who use products like those tested may, therefore, be exposed daily to less than or equal to 100 times more of these carcinogens than are adults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In our previous study, we investigated, for the first time, respiratory effects of chronic exposure to volcanic ash. The study demonstrated a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms, even in the area of highest exposure; only a slight excess prevalence of symptoms appeared to be associated with exposure to volcanic ash. To confirm the findings of our previous study, the prevalence study of chronic respiratory symptoms for residents was repeated in Kanoya and Tashiro, which are located 25 and 50 km, respectively, from the crater of Mt. Sakurajima. The concentration of suspended particulate matter in Kanoya frequently exceeded the national environmental quality standards and, during summer and winter, was 2-3 times higher than that found in Tashiro. Women who were 30-59 y of age and who had resided in Kanoya or Tashiro for more than 3 y completed a modified ATS-DLD questionnaire. The prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease was low, i.e., 6.5% in Kanoya and 6.2% in Tashiro; similar prevalences were found in women who had never smoked. When we restricted the analysis to individuals without a history of occupational exposure to dusts and who had no exposure to passive smoking, there was a slightly higher prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease in Kanoya than Tashiro, but the difference was not significant. Eye symptoms were equally prevalent in the two areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The enzyme values that most modern clinical analyzers are capable of producing are more precise than appears to be medically necessary. We surveyed clinicians for their perceived needs; based on their responses, we conclude that tight proficiency testing limits for enzyme tests are inappropriate.\r"

To describe their histologic subtypes, a group of pathologists was formed. One hundred thirteen cases were reviewed and classified according to the Working Formulation, the updated Kiel classification, and a recent description of morphologic variants of high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three major types of intermediate- or high-grade lymphomas were observed: (1) large-cell or centroblastic mainly polymorphic lymphomas with a component of immunoblasts (35 cases); (2) immunoblastic lymphomas with plasmablastic and plasmacytic features in most cases (33 cases); and (3) small non-cleaved cell Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's lymphoma (41 cases), with 15 cases fitting typical criteria of Burkitt's lymphoma and 26 heterogeneous cases in which the size and shape of the cells and the presence of plasmablastic features varied. The most frequent pathologic sites of involvement at presentation were the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, brain, oral cavity, and muscles. A comparison between the histologic type and the site of involvement showed that most cases involving lymph nodes, bone marrow, or muscles were small noncleaved cell Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's lymphomas, while those that affected the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and oral cavity were centroblastic or immunoblastic lymphomas with consistent plasmacytic differentiation. In 10 cases, previous persistent generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome was present. In 13 cases, the lymphomatous proliferation was associated with follicular or diffuse hyperplasia seen on the same lymph node biopsy specimen or in another lymph node.\r"

Computed tomography of the head showed multiple hypodense lesions. Neuropathologic examination showed that in addition to human immunodeficiency virus encephalomyelitis, there was multifocal meningoencephalitis with trophozoites and cysts morphologically indistinguishable from those of Acanthamoeba. These organisms were also found in the kidneys and adrenal glands. By immunofluorescence, the parasites showed antigenic identity with a free-living leptomyxid ameba and failed to react with any of a spectrum of antiacanthamoeba antisera. This emphasizes the importance of immunofluorescence identification of morphologically indistinguishable ameba species.\r"

Because anecdotal experience with immunostaining such reprocessed tissues had suggested improved results, we performed a prospective trial involving 13 cases to compare the intensity of immunoreactivity before and after such reprocessing.

The expression of AB antigens is rather homogeneous, while Lewis antigens are expressed in a more irregular pattern, alternating positively stained cells with negatively stained cells in the same microscopic field. The expression of blood group antigens allows the identification of residual pneumocytes inside the tumor and the proper classification of some neoplasms. Metaplastic areas show a variation in the staining profile when compared with normal tissues and pulmonary carcinomas. The most significant findings are the deletion of A antigen and the strong expression of Le antigen. Pulmonary carcinomas are composed by a heterogeneous population and tend to express antigens in the more differentiated cases or areas.

Sinusoidal endothelial cells of HCC characteristically showed a diffuse and strong immunoreactivity to ABH blood group antigens in the specimen with a comparable ABO blood group. The sinusoidal endothelial cells were also diffusely and strongly positive for UEA-I receptors. In contrast, in cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis a few sinusoidal endothelial cells were positive for ABH blood group antigens and UEA-I receptors. In normal livers, only a few sinusoidal endothelial cells were positive for ABH blood group antigens and UEA-1 receptors. Tests for factor VIII-related antigen and Lewis blood group antigens were almost negative on sinusoidal endothelial cells. Although type IV collagen was distributed diffusely in the space of Disse in these four groups, its expression was strongest in HCC. Blood vessels of portal tracts and fibrous septa were positive for ABH blood group antigens, UEA-1 receptors, factor VIII-related antigen, and type IV collagen, but negative for Lewis blood group antigens. These findings suggest that some sinusoidal endothelial cells undergo \"capillarization\" in cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, and that the majority of sinusoidal endothelial cells of HCC have phenotypic characteristics of capillaries.\r"

Histologic examination showed a chromophobic adenoma corresponding mainly to a null cell adenoma at the ultrastructural level. Focal plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation of adenoma cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic studies. It is suggested that adenomatous null cells represent pluripotent progenitor cells capable of transforming to different hormone-producing cell types. The factors accounting for differentiating to various cell populations have yet to be elucidated.\r"

The results confirm that pulmonary fat and marrow emboli are frequent in those patients who are resuscitated. A novel observation is the finding of multiple coexistent cardiac venous emboli in those resuscitated patients who have pulmonary artery obstruction with pulmonary thromboemboli. These findings suggest that these emboli regurgitate from the right side of the heart to the coronary sinus and cardiac veins in cases of pulmonary artery hypertension.\r"

All practicing ophthalmologists in the five-state area were surveyed to identify prospectively all new cases of ulcerative keratitis during a 4-month period. The number of aphakic persons using specific types of contact lenses was estimated through a telephone survey of 4178 households identified by random digit dialing. The annualized incidence of ulcerative keratitis among aphakic persons using contact lenses was estimated to be 52 cases per 10,000 aphakic contact lens wearers (95% confidence interval (CI), 31.1 to 86.9). The risk of ulcerative keratitis varied substantially by lens use, with extended wear having an estimated sevenfold greater risk relative to daily wear (95% CI, 1.6 to 30.2). Rates of ulcerative keratitis in aphakic persons using contact lenses were much greater than rates among cosmetic wearers of the same lens type: for daily-wear lenses, aphakic persons were estimated to have 6.3 times the risk of cosmetic wearers (95% CI, 1.9 to 21.0), and for extended-wear lenses, aphakic persons were estimated to have 8.7 times the risk of cosmetic wearers (95% CI, 3.5 to 21.9). These risks are useful in assessing the benefits and risks of contact lens wear as an alternative to other methods of aphakic correction.\r"

Severe bilateral ocular ischemia was induced in cats with healed lensectomy-vitrectomy wounds; 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes later, one eye from each of 18 cats underwent vitreoperfusion while the ischemia continued for 120 minutes. The other eye simultaneously underwent either continued untreated ischemia or reinstated circulation. The histopathologic abnormalities evident after 8 days depended on the duration of ischemia. Reinstated circulation yielded less retinal damage than continued ischemia. Nine additional cats underwent bilateral ischemia for at least 210 minutes. Vitreoperfusion was initiated in one eye after 30 minutes. In each cat, the vitreoperfused eye fared significantly better as observed histopathologically and electroretinographically. We believe that no other treatment has similarly limited retinal injury in vivo when initiated so long after total ocular ischemia has developed.\r"

One drop of 1% acepromazine maleate solution was instilled in one eye of monkeys in group 1 and in the glaucomatous eye of monkeys in group 2; the other eye served as the control. The IOP was measured before drug administration and 1, 4, 8, 24, and 32 hours after, with detailed slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment. Acepromazine produced no change in IOP in eyes in group 1, but it produced a fall in pressure in all eyes with high IOP in group 2, evident 1 hour after instillation, maximal between 4 and 8 hours, and still remaining after 32 hours. The pupil showed no change in size, but a transient ptosis was observed in the treated eye in all monkeys.\r"

We created serous retinal detachment in the cat eye by means of photodynamic injury produced by activation of intravascular rose bengal using filtered, focused light (550 nm). Fluorescein angiography later revealed focal retinal and choroidal vascular occlusion surrounded by a larger area of leakage through the pigment epithelium. Serous retinal detachments occurred rapidly, gradually enlarged over the next 3 days, and resolved in all eyes after 14 to 21 days. Histopathologic and ultrastructural features of early lesions included the accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in the subretinal space, pigment epithelial cell damage, and localized occlusion of retinal vessels and the choriocapillaris. Later changes consisted of limited regeneration of the retina and portions of the tapetum. In several respects, these experimental detachments resemble the serous retinal detachments associated with choroidal ischemia in humans, and may serve as a useful model in the study of choroidal microvascular hypoperfusion.\r"

The major disadvantage of the fornix approach for the adjustable suture technique has been poor exposure to the muscle-suture apparatus and poor postoperative knot exposure. We describe herein the use of a subconjunctival retraction suture for adjustable suture surgery with the fornix approach. This suture retracts the conjunctiva, exposing the adjustable muscle-suture apparatus while simultaneously fixating the globe. A novel way of tying the noose around the pole sutures and preventing noose slippage is also presented. This technique provides excellent exposure, fixation of the globe, and complete coverage of the knot with conjunctiva after adjustment.\r"

Parallel 10-hour modified diurnal curves were performed before the study and on day 14, with 4-hour curves on days 1 and 4. Both compounds demonstrated significant lowering of intraocular pressure at 8 AM, 12 hours following the evening dose, and through 10 and 6 hours following the 8 AM dose for sezolamide and MK-927, respectively. Morning trough (evening) activity as measured by mean percent change in intraocular pressure from prestudy was -9.2% for sezolamide and -11.1% for MK-927 (-13.5% and -9.6%); peak effect occurred 2 hours after dose administration and was -19.4% and -19.2% for sezolamide and MK-927, respectively. From 2 hours after dose administration, sezolamide consistently demonstrated a slightly greater decrease in intraocular pressure than MK-927; however, these differences were not statistically significant.\r"

All organisms were resistant to gentamicin in the preservation media. A significantly higher incidence of endophthalmitis was noted in patients receiving corneas from a Sri Lankan eye bank (1.25%) than in those receiving US eye bank tissue (0.14%). Donor rim cultures are important to identify those patients at increased risk of developing endophthalmitis, enabling earlier diagnosis and more specific treatment should endophthalmitis occur.\r"

In all four patients, early postoperative visual acuity was good but was eventually markedly reduced by intraocular inflammation that was first observed between 21 days and 4 months following uneventful extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Inflammation was characterized by anterior segment and vitreous cellular debris in all cases. All eyes responded to therapy that included intraocular, topical, and systemic antibiotics as well as pars plana vitrectomy and partial iridectomy. These cases further illustrate the need for microbiologic investigation, including anaerobic cultures, in all cases of chronic postoperative inflammation following extracapsular cataract extraction, regardless of the time of onset.\r"

One such setting is penetrating injury resulting from eating utensils contaminated with oral flora. We reviewed six of these injuries. Culture-positive bacterial endophthalmitis developed in four of the six eyes; only one of the eyes retained reading visual acuity (greater than 20/50) and two eyes lost light perception. The potential for infection and limited visual outcome in this series warrants aggressive prophylaxis and treatment. The unexpected isolation of Haemophilus influenzae in two of the four infections suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be considered in all such injuries since less common organisms may be encountered.\r"

We evaluated these reports in addition to one case previously reported in the literature and one patient seen at the Uveitis Clinic, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland. The patients' median age was 34 years. Twelve of 14 patients were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All patients for whom the location of the eye disease was specified presented with an iritis. Six reports included a description of ocular symmetry, with all patients having bilateral inflammation. Of the nine patients for whom data on the duration of drug use was available, seven experienced adverse effects within 8 days of beginning trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy and four showed effects within 24 hours. Three patients had histories of rechallenge with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and in each case acute iritis recurred within 24 hours of reinstitution of therapy. Five patients had additional evidence of an adverse reaction manifested as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, diffuse macular or vesicular rashes, stomatitis, glossitis, conjunctival and scleral injection, and granulomatous hepatitis. The consistent presentation including bilateral, anterior inflammation and the recurrence with rechallenge strongly indicate a cause-effect relationship. Although uveitis secondary to sulfonamides is a rarely diagnosed clinical event, recognition of the distinct presentation of this entity is important in the differential diagnosis of uveitis.\r"

The parameters measured were best corrected visual acuity, uncorrected visual acuity, and the change in cycloplegic refraction with enlarging pupil diameter. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/16 in both the radial keratotomy and control groups, but the variability (SD) was higher in the radial keratotomy group. The average uncorrected visual acuity was 0.35 (35%) better in the radial keratotomy group, but the variability was 1.77 times higher. Change in refraction with dilation occurred in 9% of the controls and 36% of the radial keratotomy patients, indicating a significant difference (P = .002). The change in refraction with dilation in the eyes with radial keratotomy was almost equally split between a hyperopic change (17%) and a myopic change (18%), which was much different than in the control eyes, only 2% of which changed in a hyperopic direction and 7% in a myopic direction. The radial keratotomy patients with a myopic change had the best uncorrected visual acuity, indicating that positive spherical aberration yielded the best aspherical surface for uncorrected visual acuity.\r"

Individual nerve fiber layer photographs were read by two masked observers. The more sensitive of the two identified nerve fiber layer defects in 88% of readable photographs at the time field loss first occurred; 60% (6/10) of eyes already had nerve fiber layer defects 6 years before field loss. In contrast, the nerve fiber layer was considered abnormal in only 11% (3/27) of normal eyes and 26% (84/327) of hypertensive eyes. The location of nerve fiber layer and field defects closely corresponded, but nerve fiber layer loss was generally more widespread. Examiner experience and severity of optic nerve damage influenced results. Mild focal defects were more readily recognized than more severe diffuse atrophy. Nerve fiber layer defects expanded with time, often by the development and coalescence of adjacent areas of damage.\r"

In screening our patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa for the codon 23 transversion, we found positive results in four affected individuals from two families with sectoral retinitis pigmentosa, while 12 patients with sectoral retinitis pigmentosa from different families had negative results, suggesting that other gene sites or locations may give this same phenotypic change. From our patients' history of light exposure and the location of degeneration in the retina, we hypothesize that light phototoxicity may be playing an expressive role in this point mutation of the rhodopsin gene. This is the first report in which a type of retinitis pigmentosa has been associated with a specific molecular gene defect, although the actual pathophysiologic mechanism currently is unknown.\r"

On average, these patients (mean age, 37 years) had significantly better visual acuity and larger electroretinographic amplitudes than 131 unrelated patients (mean age, 32 years) with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa without this mutation. However, these 17 patients from separate families, as well as 12 relatives with the mutation from four of these families, showed interfamilial and intrafamilial variability with respect to severity of their ocular disease, suggesting that some factor(s) other than this gene defect itself is involved in the expression of their condition. This form of retinitis pigmentosa can now be detected by testing leukocyte DNA from peripheral blood. Some mechanisms by which this mutation in the rhodopsin gene could lead to rod photoreceptor cell death are suggested.\r"

Fifty eight consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were given 30 U of anistreplase intravenously within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. A fall in the plasma concentration fibrinogen to less than 1.0 g/l 90 minutes after administration of anistreplase was considered to reflect a systemic lytic state. Coronary angiography was performed 48 hours after thrombolytic treatment. The overall patency rate was 74% (43/58). Patency rates were significantly different in patients with a systemic lytic (83% (43/52)) and a systemic non-lytic state (0% (0/6)). The absence of a systemic lytic state after anistreplase administration seemed to be highly predictive of the failure of coronary thrombolysis. Coagulation studies showed evidence of inhibition of anistreplase induced fibrinolytic activity which may explain the failure of thrombolytic treatment in patients with evidence of a systemic non-lytic state.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure concentrations of serum hypoxanthine, lactate, and noradrenaline were measured before and after submaximal treadmill exercise in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and nine healthy volunteers. In four patients the concentration of hypoxanthine was significantly higher than in the controls or in the remaining eight patients with congestive heart failure. Venous lactate and noradrenaline in the four patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine were also significantly higher than those in the eight patients with normal concentrations of hypoxanthine. Patients who responded normally were also more likely to have been treated with vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise induced arrhythmias were more common in the patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the excess purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure might be the result of a \"relative\" disturbance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate caused by the shift of cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis during submaximal exercise and that hypoxanthine (a substrate for xanthine oxidase and a source of free radicals) was increased after submaximal exercise in some patients with congestive heart failure.\r"

Pharmacological stress with dipyridamole can be used as an alternative to exercise for thallium scanning. Forty patients with a history of angina and an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram were studied by dipyridamole thallium myocardial perfusion tomography and dipyridamole magnetic resonance wall motion imaging with a cine gradient refocused sequence. Images for both scans were obtained in the oblique horizontal and vertical long axis and short axis planes before and after pharmacological stress with dipyridamole. The myocardium was divided into nine segments for direct comparison of perfusion with wall motion. Segments were assessed visually into grades--normal, hypokinesis or reduced perfusion, and akinesis or very reduced perfusion. After dipyridamole there were reversible wall motion abnormalities in 24 (62%) of 39 patients with coronary artery disease and 24 (67%) of 36 patients with reversible thallium defects. The site of wall motion deterioration was always the site of a reversible thallium defect. Thallium defects affecting more than two segments were always associated with wall motion deterioration but most single segment thallium defects were undetected by magnetic resonance imaging. There was a significant correlation between detection of wall motion abnormality, the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease, and the induction of chest pain by dipyridamole. There were no significant differences in ventricular volume or ejection fraction changes after dipyridamole between the groups with and without detectable reversible wall motion changes but the normalised magnetic resonance signal intensity of the abnormally moving segments was significantly less than the signal intensity of the normal segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence of angina pectoris fell by 10% in the treatment group but rose by 60% in the control group. The perceived energy level rose by significantly more in the treatment group than in the controls. The rise in predicted maximum oxygen uptake was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group as was the reduction in the double product (a reflection of myocardial workload) at peak exercise.

The corrected orthogonal Frank lead electrocardiogram was continuously recorded and computer processed during bicycle ergometry. With exercise, maximal spatial P wave vectors shifted downward. The Q wave amplitude became more negative and the R wave amplitude diminished considerably in leads X and Y: the S wave amplitude decreased only slightly in these leads. The QRS vectors shifted towards right and posteriorly during exertion and a further shift in the same direction was seen in the recovery period. The ST segment amplitude 60 ms after the J point decreased with exertion and became negative at heart rates above 140 beats per minute, in particular in lead Y. ST segment depression increased with age. The T wave amplitude decreased during exercise and increased sharply in the recovery period. Though mean R wave amplitude in leads X and Y became more negative with exercise, this response was unpredictable in individual women. The exercise induced changes in QRS vectors in women resembled those described in men. Changes in the amplitude of the R wave should not be used for the diagnosis of coronary disease in women. ST segment depression was more pronounced in the inferiorly oriented lead Y than in lead X but it was unrelated to changes in the QRS vectors in these leads.\r"

A pre-existing cardiac abnormality (mitral leaflet prolapse in a third of patients) was detected in 26 (74%). The source of the organisms in the community acquired infections was assumed to be the skin, though lesions were seldom demonstrated; most hospital acquired infections resulted from intravenous devices. Community acquired organisms were usually sensitive to penicillin, whereas those acquired in hospital were often multiresistant. Most infections were caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. The frequency of acute presentation (26%) and of major neurological abnormality (23%), together with the need for valve replacement (often emergency) (51%) and the mortality (36%) suggest that coagulase negative staphylococci can be virulent aggressive pathogens, mimicking Staphylococcus aureus.\r"

This venous anomaly was more common in patients with tetralogy of Fallot or ventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia. Patients with the venous anomaly were more likely to have a right aortic arch. The anomalous course of the brachiocephalic vein from the neck to the junction of the superior vena cava was shown by cross sectional echocardiography.

  ".W": "Twenty four hour ambulatory ST segment monitoring was performed on 48 members (43 players and five members of the management/technical team) of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) symphony orchestra without a history of cardiac disease. This period included final rehearsals and live performances (for audience and radio) of music by Richard Strauss and Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall (n = 36) and Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky at the Barbican Arts Centre (n = 21). During the period of monitoring one person (2%) had transient ST segment changes. Mean heart rates were significantly higher during the live performances than during the rehearsals. Mean heart rates during the live performance of Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky were significantly higher than during Strauss and Mozart in those (n = 6) who were monitored on both occasions. Mean heart rates in the management and technical team were higher than those of the players. The recognised circadian pattern of heart rate, with a peak in the morning waking hours, was altered similarly during both concert days, with a primary peak occurring in the evening hours and a lesser peak in the morning for both musicians and management/technical staff. This study showed that environmental factors are of primary importance in defining the circadian pattern of heart rate. This has important implications when identifying peak periods of cardiovascular stress and tailoring drug treatment for patients with angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate haemodynamic assessment of mitral stenosis by hydraulic formulas requires measurement of the mean valve gradient and the cardiac output. The calculation is laborious, particularly in the presence of atrial fibrillation when averaged values obtained from multiple beat-to-beat determinations must be used. The relations between valve area, end diastolic gradient, and heart rate in 20 patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation were examined. In each patient the end diastolic pressure gradient for each cardiac cycle was related linearly to the RR interval of that cycle, and this relation was unchanged on exercise. The slope (S) and intercept (I) of this relation correlated with the degree of mitral stenosis as measured by the Gorlin valve area. The regression equations describing these relations were then used to construct a nomogram relating end diastolic pressure gradient to mitral valve area at different heart rates. When the nomogram was applied to catheterisation data from a further 30 patients the results correlated well with direct calculation of valve area by the Gorlin formula. The nomogram is simple to use, does not require measurement of cardiac output, and is independent of heart rate so that it is unnecessary for the patient to exercise during catheterisation.\r"

Repeat endomyocardial biopsy after four days of treatment with steroids and azathioprine showed substantial histological improvement, a reduction in cellular infiltrate and myocardial necrosis, and interstitial fibrosis. Serial biopsies at 2 weeks and then 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 14 months after the initial biopsy showed progressive clearing of cellular infiltrate, increasing interstitial fibrosis, and compensatory myocyte hypertrophy by 4 months. At 14 months scattered lymphocytes persisted but myocyte abnormalities had resolved completely. The patient remained symptom free and systolic function was normal during this recovery period. Early endomyocardial biopsy (within one week of diagnosis) may yield useful histological information on the response to treatment in patients with myocarditis. It may not be necessary to wait the customary 3-4 weeks to repeat the biopsy. This case shows the chronology of histological changes and emphasises that a return to normal myocardial function may precede resolution of the histological abnormalities, which may persist in part or may resolve totally after the acute episode.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of ophthalmoscopic findings according to retinal camera screening and ophthalmoscopy and outcome of referral to ophthalmologist. SETTING--Outpatient diabetic clinics of three teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals. PATIENTS--2159 Adults selected randomly from the diabetic clinics, excluding only those registered as blind or those in wheelchairs and unable to enter the screening vehicle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Numbers of patients and eyes correctly identified by each technique as requiring referral with potentially treatable retinopathy (new vessel formation and maculopathy) and congruence in numbers of microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and exudates reported. RESULTS--Camera screening missed two cases of new vessel formation and did not identify a further 12 but indicated a need for referral. Ophthalmoscopy missed five cases of new vessel formation and indicated a need for referral in another four for other reasons. Maculopathy was reported in 147 eyes with camera screening alone and 95 eyes by ophthalmoscopy only (chi 2 = 11.2; p less than 0.001), in 66 and 29 of which respectively maculopathy was subsequently confirmed. Overall, 38 eyes received laser treatment for maculopathy after detection by camera screening compared with 17 after ophthalmoscopic detection (chi 2 = 8.0; p less than 0.01). Camera screening underestimated numbers of microaneurysms (chi 2 = 12.9; p less than 0.001) and haemorrhages (chi 2 = 7.4; p less than 0.01) and ophthalmoscopy underestimated hard exudates (chi 2 = 48.2; p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS--Non-mydriatic Polaroid retinal photography is at least as good as ophthalmoscopy with mydriasis in routine diabetic clinics in identifying new vessel formation and absence of retinopathy and is significantly better in detecting exudative maculopathy.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective case-control study based on a six year follow up of a general population sample of men aged 50 at baseline in 1983-4. Serum samples were frozen at the time of the baseline examination and kept at -70 degrees C for six years, after which the lipoprotein (a) concentrations in the samples were measured in cases and controls. SETTING--City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS--26 Men, from a general population sample of 776 men, who had sustained a myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the six years and 109 randomly selected controls from the same sample who had remained free of myocardial infarction. In neither cases nor controls was there a history of myocardial infarction at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Proportion of myocardial infarction or deaths from coronary heart disease, or both, in relation to the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration. RESULTS--Men who suffered coronary heart disease had significantly higher serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations than controls (mean difference 105 mg/l; 95% confidence interval 18 to 192 mg/l). Men with the highest fifth of serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations (cut off point 365 mg/l) suffered a coronary heart disease rate which was more than twice that of men with the lowest four fifths of concentrations. Logistic regression analysis showed the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration to be significantly associated with coronary heart disease independently of other risk factors. CONCLUSION--The serum lipoprotein (a) concentration in middle aged men is an independent risk factor for subsequent myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease.\r"

DESIGN--Postal survey of 312 general practitioners serving a population of about 650,000; supplementary study of ear, nose, and throat outpatients to quantify the improvement in aural acuity after wax removal. SETTING--Catchment area of the Edinburgh otolaryngological unit. PARTICIPANTS--289 General practitioners who responded to the survey; 21 outpatients in the ear, nose, and throat department with occlusive wax. RESULTS--274 General practitioners removed wax by syringing, but only 53 (19%) always performed the procedure themselves; the remainder routinely delegated the task to practice nurses, some of whom had received no instruction. Ears were rarely examined again after the procedure. Complications had been experienced by 105 practitioners (38%) and included perforation, canal lacerations, and failure of wax removal. The removal of occlusive wax improved hearing by a mean of 5 dB over the frequencies analysed. CONCLUSIONS--About 44,000 ears are syringed each year in the area and complications requiring specialist referral are estimated to occur in 1/1000 ears syringed. The incidence of complications could be reduced by a greater awareness of the potential hazards, increased instruction of personnel, and more careful selection of patients.\r"

DESIGN--Comparison of haemophiliac children with matched control groups of diabetic and healthy children. SETTING--The West of Scotland Children's Haemophilia Centre, Glasgow. PATIENTS--43 Children aged 3 to 16 years with mild, moderate, and severe clotting disorders were matched with control groups of 46 diabetic children and 42 physically healthy children. INTERVENTIONS--Parents of children aged 3-5 years were interviewed with the behaviour screening questionnaire. Children aged 6 to 16 were assessed by parental and teacher report using standardised questionnaires and self report using a computerised depression inventory. All were scored numerically according to the presence of symptoms of emotional and behavioural problems. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The groups were compared for mean scores on each rating device and for number of children achieving scores within the pathological range. RESULTS--In the 6-16 age group five haemophiliac children, five diabetic children, and three healthy children scored in the pathological range on the parent questionnaire, as did two, three, and five respectively on the teacher questionnaire and four, four, and eight on the depression inventory. There was no significant difference across the three groups. Analysis of mean scores similarly showed no significant difference across groups. In contrast, the single measure used for younger children showed an increase in behavioural difficulties among the diabetic children. CONCLUSION--Haemophiliac children attending the West of Scotland Centre were no more disturbed than their diabetic or healthy peers despite the identification of HIV infection within the clinic and the widespread adverse publicity associated with AIDS and HIV infection.\r"

During the pre-interview stage the partners learnt about the dynamics of the practice and their own personalities. The examination of the candidates by an outside assessor as well as the partners gave a sense of security and a certainty that mistakes were unlikely to be made.

DESIGN--Prospective observational study. SETTING--Random sample of municipal pharmacies throughout Italy. SUBJECTS--A total of 6992 clients of the pharmacies who requested the study drugs over a period of four months. INTERVENTION--Exposure of patients to two information leaflets, one approved by the Ministry of Health, and the other an experimental sheet prepared by the research working group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The degree of acceptability of the information was assessed by using a pretested questionnaire. Comments concerning information needs were also encouraged and collected. RESULTS--6992 Clients responded to the questionnaire. Non-metropolitan (urban and rural) areas had the highest rate of participation. The participants strongly preferred the experimental leaflets to the approved leaflets, both with respect to accessibility of the contents (overall preference 78.1% v 17.8%) and ease of understanding the contraindications of drug use (90.2% v 73.7%). Basic attitudes related to the use of written information were similar among clients of different age groups, educational levels (though emerging people with primary school or lower educational levels showed slightly lesser understanding), and geographic areas. Up to 50% of those who took over the counter drugs indicated a disposition to change their drug seeking behaviour on the basis of the information in the experimental leaflet. The comments provided a useful complementary set of data on the information needs expressed by participants. CONCLUSIONS--The results of this pilot study indicate that patients will enter active programmes to investigate the provision of problem oriented drug information. Their information needs seem to concern both prescribed and over the counter drugs. More extensive and systematic work is required to develop an improved consumer oriented language for widely used drugs.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To find out whether a 10-14 days' course of antibiotics early in the course of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infections could reduce the severity and duration of the disease and whether the antibody response in patients with reactive arthritis associated with yersinia infection differed between those treated and those not treated with the antibiotics. DESIGN--Prospective multicentre trial in which patients were randomised to treatment or no treatment with antibiotics. Patients were seen at three and six weeks and three, six, nine, 12, and 18 months after their first visit. SETTING--Departments of infectious diseases in three hospitals in Linkoping, Malmo, and Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS--40 Consecutive patients who had had symptoms of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection for less than four weeks. INTERVENTIONS--20 Patients were allocated to treatment with antibiotics and 20 patients did not receive antibiotics. All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and four also received intra-articular steroid injections after at least six weeks' observation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arthritic symptoms assessed clinically and by using Ritchies' index; blood measurements reflecting inflammatory activity; serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody titres; HLA tissue type. RESULTS--No difference was observed concerning duration of arthritis, grade of inflammation, and number of joints affected between patients treated and those not treated with antibiotics. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and haptoglobin, IgG, and IgA concentrations. All values had returned to normal within three months. No patient developed chronic arthritis, but sustained slight arthralgia occurred in three patients. The HLA-B27 antigen was found in 23 (58%) of the patients, and its presence did not affect clinical outcome. The IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses were similar in patients treated with antibiotics and those not treated. CONCLUSION--Short term antibiotic treatment has no beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of thiazide diuretic drugs on rates of bone mineral loss. DESIGN--Longitudinal, observational study with a mean follow up of five years. SETTING--Hawaii Osteoporosis Center, Honolulu. SUBJECTS--1017 Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1920, of whom 378 were treated for hypertension (study group) and 639 did not have hypertension (control group). INTERVENTION--Thiazide diuretics were taken by 325 men for a mean of 11.9 years; 53 men took antihypertensive drugs other than thiazides. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of bone loss estimated from serial photon absorptiometric scanning at three skeletal sites (calcaneus, distal radius, and proximal radius). RESULTS--Rates of bone loss at all three sites were significantly reduced among thiazide users when compared with controls. The reductions in loss rate ranged from 28.8% (p = 0.02) (distal radius) to 49.2% (p = 0.0005) (calcaneus) relative to the controls. At all three sites the men taking other antihypertensive drugs had faster loss rates (22.6-43.1%) than those of the controls but the difference was significant only for the distal radius. CONCLUSION--Thiazide diuretics slow the rate of bone loss in elderly men.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis of request patterns by hospital divisions before and after intervention and of costs of intervention and savings achieved. SETTING--Haematology laboratory of an inner city district general hospital. INTERVENTIONS--Monthly release of a comparison of clinicians' workload statistics, issue of on call guidelines, and promulgation of information (by seminars and factsheets) on appropriate use of tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Request patterns before and after intervention. RESULTS--During the year after intervention requests fell by at least a fifth, and the reduction persisted over the next two years. The reduction was most pronounced in relation to inpatients within the division of medicine, for whom requests fell from an average of 4.0 per patient in the six months before intervention to 2.9 per patient in the six months after. CONCLUSIONS--A definite and sustained reduction in inappropriate requests for laboratory investigations may be achieved by an ongoing policy of intervention including issuing guidelines and factsheets and holding seminars, but a positive attitude among senior consultant staff is crucial.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the diagnostic value and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in patients with coma of unclear origin with suspected poisoning. DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised study. SETTING--Intensive care unit at a major teaching hospital. PATIENTS--105 Unconscious adults admitted consecutively with suspected drug overdosage during 18 months from a total of 362 cases of poisoning. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, epilepsy, obvious poisoning with drugs identified unequivocally from information from relatives or others as other than benzodiazepines, and coma score greater than 10 on a scale graded from 4 to 20. Patients were allocated randomly to receive flumazenil (21 men and 32 women) or placebo (25 men and 27 women). INTERVENTIONS--Intravenous injection of flumazenil (10 ml, 0.1 mg/ml) or placebo (10 ml vehicle alone) given double blind over three minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum and urine concentrations of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and several other agents; blood gas tensions; standardised evaluation on admission and five minutes after the injection by means of coma scale score and urgent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions indicated according to the history and clinical examination; standardised interview after the injection to try to ascertain further information; and adverse reactions. RESULTS--Benzodiazepines were found in the serum in 36 of the 53 patients in the flumazenil group and in 37 of the 52 who received placebo. The average coma scale score increased significantly after injection in the flumazenil group (6.4 v 12.1, p less than 0.001) but not in the placebo group. In the flumazenil group several interventions were rendered unnecessary by the injection: gastric lavage and urinary catheterisation (19 patients each), intubation (21), artificial ventilation and computed tomography of the brain (three patients each), blood culture and lumbar puncture (one patient each), and electroencephalography (two). In the placebo group the indications for these procedures did not change in any patient after injection. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in reduction of the frequency of indications for gastric lavage after injection between the two groups was 21% to 51%, that for intubation 25% to 55%, and that for urinary catheterisation 21% to 51%. In the flumazenil group 21 patients gave valuable information on their drug ingestion within 10 minutes after injection compared with only one in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Nine adverse reactions were recorded in the flumazenil group, eight of which were graded as mild and one severe. The safety of the antagonist was acceptable, even though 60% of the patients in the flumazenil group had multiple drug poisoning including benzodiazepine. No epileptic seizures or arrhythmias were recorded. CONCLUSION--Flumazenil is a valuable and safe differential diagnostic tool in unclear cases of multiple drug poisoning.\r"

  ".U": "91105382\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether there is sufficient benefit to be gained by offering screening for breast cancer with mammography to women aged 65-79, who are not normally invited for screening. DESIGN--Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation. The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50-64) from the same general practice. SETTING--One group general practice in south Manchester. PATIENTS--The 631 women aged 65-79 on the practice list. A total of 42 (7%) were excluded by the general practitioner, and 22 (4%) invitation letters were returned by the post office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population coverage ratio, crude invited population coverage ratio, and corrected invited population coverage ratio. RESULTS--344 Patients aged 65-79 (61% of those invited, excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77% of women aged 50-64. The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population coverage ratio = 66.5%, crude invited population coverage ratio = 69.3%, corrected invited population coverage ratio = 76.8% for women aged 50-64, compared with 54.5%, 58.4%, and 60.7% respectively for women aged 65-79. All four biopsies done in the older women gave positive results, giving a cancer detection rate of 11.6/1000 compared with 4.1/1000 among younger women. CONCLUSIONS--These results show that there is a potential for high attendance at routine screening by older women if they are invited in the same way as younger women. If these results are found elsewhere the costs and benefits of screening older women should be reassessed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare a peak flow self management plan for asthma with a symptoms only plan. DESIGN--Randomisation to one of the self management plans and follow up for a year. SETTING--Four partner, rural training practice in Norfolk. SUBJECTS--115 Patients (46 children and 69 adults) with asthma who were having prophylactic treatment for asthma and attending a nurse run asthma clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The number of doctor consultations, courses of oral steroids, and short term nebulised salbutamol treatments and the number of patients who required doctor consultations, courses of oral steroids, and short term nebulised salbutamol. RESULTS--Both self management plans produced significant reductions in the outcome measures but there were no significant differences in the degree of improvement between the groups. The results were similar for children and adults. The proportions of patients requiring a doctor consultation fell from 98% (50/51) to 66% (34/51) in the peak flow group and from 97% (62/64) to 53% (34/64) in the symptoms only group and the proportions requiring oral steroids from 73% (34/46) to 47% (21/46) and 52% (31/60) to 12% (7/60). The median number of doctor consultations was reduced from 8.0 to 2.0 in the peak flow group and from 4.5 to 1.0 in the symptoms only group. CONCLUSIONS--The peak flow meter was not the crucial ingredient in the improved illness of the two groups. Teaching patients the importance of their symptoms and the appropriate action to take when their asthma deteriorates is the key to effective management of asthma. Simply prescribing peak flow meters without a system of self management and regular review will be unlikely to improve patient care.\r"

DESIGN--Information on abuse and risk factors was collected over six months from carers and patients. Risk factors were identified in the abused group and compared with those in a non-abused control group. SETTING--Carers were interviewed at home; patients were examined in the wards of Putney and Barnes geriatric hospitals, London. SUBJECTS--All patients referred from any source for respite care to the geriatric services over a six month period and their carers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Amount of physical and verbal abuse or neglect. Quantification of risk factors and correlation with the presence or absence of abuse. RESULTS--45% Of carers openly admitted to some form of abuse. Few patients admitted abuse. The most significant risk factor for physical abuse was alcohol consumption by the carer (p less than 0.001). Other significant risk factors were a poor pre-morbid relationship and previous abuse over many years. Abuse was often reciprocated and was associated with social dysfunction in many patients. Service delivery, respite care, and level of mental and physical disability were not significantly associated with abuse. CONCLUSION--The high level of abuse found in elderly patients in respite care was particularly associated with alcohol abuse and long term relationships of poor quality, which are difficult to change. Even with increased provision of services, care in the community may not be the best solution for these people.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To see whether misusers of injected drugs who stop injecting or switch to a programme of maintenance treatment with methadone have a reduced risk of progression of HIV infection when compared with a group of persistent misusers. DESIGN--Observational cohort study in HIV seropositive subjects with a current or past history of misusing injected drugs. SETTING--HIV outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland. PATIENTS--297 Current and former parenteral drug misusers (median age 27) with asymptomatic HIV infection. During the observation period 80 subjects adhered to a programme of maintenance treatment with methadone, 124 continued with parenteral drug misuse, and 93 former misusers remained free of illicit drugs. No antiretroviral treatment was given during the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Probability of progression of HIV infection from asymptomatic to symptomatic (Centers for Disease Control stage IV) as calculated by life table analysis and compared in the three groups of patients by means of a log rank test, and predictors of disease progression as analysed with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS--The 297 patients were followed up for a median of 16 months. The median duration of injecting drug misuse before enrollment was 7.1 years. There were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to CD4+ counts at the beginning of the study (median 0.44 x 10(9)/l). Life table analysis showed a significantly lower probability of progression of HIV disease in both the methadone treated group and former drug misusers than in persistent injecting drug misusers. Multivariate regression analysis showed a relative risk of progression of the disease of 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67; p less than 0.01) in persistent injecting drug misusers, 0.48 (0.29 to 0.77; p less than 0.01) in the methadone treated group, and 0.66 (0.41 to 1.06; p = 0.085) in former drug misusers. CONCLUSIONS--Stopping the misuse of injected drugs slows the progression of HIV disease in infected subjects. Drug treatment programmes are effective in secondary prevention of HIV associated morbidity.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. SETTING--Hospital outpatient clinics in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--Twenty clinically stable patients (13 women, seven men) with nocturnal asthma, median age 39 (range 18-60) years. INTERVENTIONS--Salmeterol 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms and placebo taken each morning and evening by metered dose inhaler. Rescue salbutamol inhalers were provided throughout the run in and study periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Improvement in nocturnal asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow rates and change in sleep quality as measured by electroencephalography. RESULTS--Salmeterol improved the lowest overnight peak flow rate at both 50 micrograms (difference in median values (95% confidence interval for difference in medians) 69 (18 to 88) l/min) and 100 micrograms (72 (23 to 61) l/min) doses twice daily. While taking salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily patients had an objective improvement in sleep quality, spending less time awake or in light sleep (-9 (-4 to -44) min) and more time in stage 4 sleep (26 (6-34) min). CONCLUSIONS--Salmeterol is an effective long acting inhaled bronchodilator for patients with nocturnal asthma and at a dose of 50 micrograms twice daily improves objective sleep quality.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective review of all analyses of obstetric practice based on a computerised data system from January 1983 to June 1988. SETTING--Maternity department of the regional referral hospital in Oxford. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Congruence with the principles of clinical audit; that is, comparing clinical practice with previously agreed standards and changing practice to meet these standards if necessary. RESULTS--Over the five and a half years of the study the data formed the basis of 130 special inquiries into different aspects of obstetric practice. Most inquiries seemed to be aimed only at describing current activities and identifying trends. Genuine clinical audit was rare. Simple audits--for example, concerning induction for pregnancy after term--could be supported by the computerised data, but for detailed and wide ranging audits--for example, reducing antenatal clinic visits for low risk multiparas--the data had to be supplemented from other sources. CONCLUSIONS--Routinely collected computerised data enable ongoing clinical audit, but it becomes a reality only when clinicians agree on standards of practice and have a flexible attitude towards change. Even then, genuine clinical audits of obstetric practice demand more detailed and comprehensive data than are generally available on such systems.\r"

DESIGN--Case series. SETTING-Day centre for adults with mental handicap. SUBJECTS--A balanced sample of 75 of the 150 people attending the day centre. 10 Were excluded because consent was not given. RESULTS--The subjects did not consult their general practitioners more frequently than the general population but were more likely to be taking prescribed drugs, and 57% of these prescriptions had not been reviewed by a doctor. Thirty three people failed vision screening, including 13 who wore glasses. Twenty seven of the 62 who were testable had a hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS--As only eight out of 65 people examined in the study did not have an appreciable problem brought to light, screening seems to be worth while. Whether such screening needs to be done by a medically qualified person needs further research.\r"

These reactions appear to occur because of differences in the metabolism and detoxification of reactive metabolites of the sulfonamides. N-Acetylation is a major metabolic pathway for the sulfonamides. Slow acetylation phenotype might be a risk factor for the development of these reactions. We determined the acetylation phenotype of 21 patients who had suffered hypersensitivity reactions to the sulfonamides. There were 11 females and 10 males in the group, with a mean age of 15 years (age range, 1.8 to 50 years). Their acetylator phenotype was determined by determining the ratio of urinary caffeine metabolites (1-methylxanthine to 5-amino-6-formylmethyluracil after an oral dose of 50 mg caffeine). Nineteen (90%) of the patients were slow acetylators compared to a 55% incidence of slow acetylators in a race-matched control population (p less than 0.008). This suggests that a slow acetylator phenotype is a risk factor for the development of sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions and provides further support for the role of imbalances in genetically determined pathways of metabolism and detoxification of the sulfonamides in the pathogenesis of these reactions.\r"

Each subject was given single doses of 100 mg imipramine hydrochloride and 100 mg desipramine hydrochloride on separate occasions. Imipramine demethylation clearance was 0.74 L.min-1 (mean; range, 0.31-1.24) in poor metabolizers of mephenytoin compared with 1.43 L.min-1 (mean; range, 0.61-3.81) in extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). It has previously been shown that the imipramine clearance by way of other pathways and desipramine oral clearance, both largely representing 2-hydroxylation, are considerably lower in poor metabolizers of sparteine than in extensive metabolizers of sparteine. In contrast, five subjects who were poor metabolizers of mephenytoin and extensive metabolizers of sparteine and a control group of 11 subjects who were extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin and sparteine showed no statistically significant difference with regard to these parameters. One subject who was a poor metabolizer of mephenytoin and sparteine had the lowest imipramine oral clearance of all 22 subjects studied. In conclusion, this and an earlier study show that the oxidation of imipramine is mediated by means of two different polymorphic P450 isozymes, 2-hydroxylation by way of the sparteine oxygenase (P450IID6) and demethylation by way of the mephenytoin oxygenase (P450IIC8).\r"

Patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 115 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week single-blind placebo washout phase were randomized (double-blind) to receive either betaxolol or atenolol in a dose-escalation manner. The dose (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg betaxolol; 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg atenolol) was increased if the supine diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg after 4 weeks at each level. The final dose in the escalation phase was continued for an additional 12 weeks and then followed by a 2-week placebo phase. The data were analyzed with a population model using the program NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effects model). Atenolol exhibited a graded dose-response curve, whereas the lowest dose of betaxolol produced maximum or near-maximum effect. The estimated maximum effect (drug plus possibly unmeasured placebo effect) was similar for both treatments, about 13 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 10 to 15 mm Hg). A trend toward less interindividual variability (coefficient of variation) was apparent for betaxolol compared to atenolol, 19% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 29%) versus 31% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 47%). The intraindividual variability (standard deviation) in supine diastolic blood pressure, 5.9 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 5.2 to 6.5 mm Hg), did not differ significantly between drugs despite significantly greater intraindividual variability (coefficient of variation) in atenolol concentrations, 62% (95% confidence interval, 48% to 73%) versus 26% (95% confidence interval, 22% to 29%) for betaxolol.\r"

A single 100 mg intravenous and 100 mg oral dose of moclobemide was administered before and after 2 weeks of cimetidine administration (200 mg five times a day). The data on intravenous administration indicated that cimetidine produced a statistically significant alteration in the following disposition parameters (mean values for control versus cimetidine): systemic clearance, 46.6 versus 28.3 L/hr; mean residence time, 2.1 versus 3.2 hours; elimination half-life, 1.6 versus 2.3 hours. There was no significant difference in the steady-state volume of distribution. The absolute oral bioavailability of moclobemide increased significantly after cimetidine administration (54% versus 68%), as did the maximum plasma concentration after a single oral dose (575 versus 787 ng/ml). There were no differences in the mean absorption time or time to achieve maximum concentration. The values of systemic and apparent oral clearances of moclobemide after cimetidine administration were directly related to the corresponding control values before cimetidine. In contrast, the percentage change in clearance was essentially independent of the corresponding initial control clearance value.\r"

After an overnight fast, 5 mg glipizide was given with either 150 ml water or water containing 850 mg magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide increased the areas under the plasma glipizide concentration-time curves (AUC) from 0 to 1/2 hour and from 0 to 1 hour by 180% (p less than 0.05) and 69% (p less than 0.05), respectively. The peak plasma concentration, time to peak, total AUC, elimination half-life, and mean residence time of glipizide remained unchanged. The incremental plasma insulin area from 0 to 1/2 hour increased by 85% (p less than 0.05), and the time to maximal insulin response was reduced (p less than 0.05) during the magnesium hydroxide phase. The corresponding decremental plasma glucose area increased fourfold (p less than 0.05), and the maximal glucose decrease was 35% greater (p less than 0.05) than during the control phase. We conclude that the concomitant ingestion of magnesium hydroxide and glipizide may result in accelerated absorption of glipizide and increased early insulin and glucose responses.\r"

A population of 178 students including 19 smokers were subjected to this caffeine test to establish their P-450IA2 index. Both stated numbers of cigarettes smoked per day and urinary cotinine levels as a confirmatory measure correlated significantly with enzyme activity showing dose-effect relationships (r = 0.62 and 0.89, respectively). Nevertheless, more nonsmokers than smokers had the highest enzyme indexes, suggesting that dietary elements or other factors may determine P-450IA2 activities in populations. Because P-450IA2 is a monooxygenase that may be confined to the liver, caffeine reveals directly the Ah-receptor-dependent enzyme induction only in the liver, but it may also be a signal of induction elsewhere.\r"

Blockade of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was assessed by determining the dose ratios (DR) of isoproterenol infusions required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min before and after timolol infusion. The logarithm of timolol concentration in plasma was linearly related to the logarithm (DR-1) of isoproterenol infusion, with a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 +/- 0.11 (+/- SD; n = 24) at timolol concentrations well below 1 ng/ml. The increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and norepinephrine plasma levels caused by isoproterenol infusions were attenuated after timolol. Quinidine administration increased timolol plasma levels and cardiac beta-blocking effects by 10% to 40%. It was concluded that timolol at concentrations below 1 ng/ml in plasma competitively antagonizes cardiac and noncardiac effects of isoproterenol infusions. Timolol effects are augmented after quinidine administration. The beta-blockade occurring at low plasma levels can explain side effects and actions of ocularly applied timolol.\r"

Change in blood pressure activates homeostatic reflexes that may change this relationship. This study examines the effect of autonomic (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic, parasympathetic, and alpha-adrenergic) blockade on the dose versus blood pressure response relationship to sequential doses of phenylephrine in humans. Phenylephrine dose responses were conducted under controlled conditions, during propranolol and atropine infusion, during prazosin-induced alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, and during prazosin, propranolol, and atropine administration. Propranolol-atropine infusion decreased the threshold dose of phenylephrine required to increase mean blood pressure (p less than 0.00001), increased the slope of the phenylephrine dose versus increase in mean blood pressure relationship (p = 0.019), and and decreased the dose of phenylephrine required to increase mean blood pressure by 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.00001). Determination of the alpha-adrenergic blocking potency of prazosin was not affected by autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine (dose ratio 5.2 before and 5.0 after autonomic blockade; p = 0.465). We conclude that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic and muscarinic blockade increase sensitivity to phenylephrine by increasing the slope and decreasing the threshold dose of the phenylephrine dose-response curve, and that alpha-adrenergic-blocking potency of prazosin may be determined with or without blocking homeostatic blood pressure regulatory mechanisms in humans.\r"

In responders a maintenance dose was given for 24 hours, aimed to achieve steady-state conditions. At baseline and during the treatment and washout periods 24-hour Holter recordings were performed. In addition, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and plasma concentration of barucainide were measured. In 9 of 12 patients dose titration was effective (mean dose, 185 mg). In six of nine patients arrhythmia suppression persisted during maintenance therapy (mean dose, 18 mg/hr). Plasma concentrations correlated with given doses, rather than with antiarrhythmic efficacy. During the washout period, five patients required more than 12 hours for recurrence of arrhythmias. Treatment was stopped in one patient because of proarrhythmia; one patient had moderate heat sensations. Thus barucainide is a potent class IB agent, with a favorable side effect profile.\r"

Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug. On the contrary, no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min). Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug, whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans.\r"

We have also measured arteriovenous differences in platelet-activating factor concentration, as well as platelet-activating factor content in glomeruli from rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure. 3. After glycerol injection, untreated rats showed a marked reduction in inulin clearance which reached 77% in the first 30 min. The reduction was only 27% in the rats treated with BN-52021 and 38% in the rats treated with alprazolam (5 mg/kg), with statistically significant differences between treated and untreated groups. 4. Clearance of p-aminohippuric acid was also improved with BN-52021 or alprazolam treatment. 5. This protective effect of BN-52021 was observed in a more prolonged follow-up (3 days). 6. Glomeruli from rats with acute renal failure, treated or untreated with BN-52021, showed similar amounts of platelet-activating factor, whereas it was undetectable in glomeruli from normal rats. Furthermore, rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure released greater amounts of platelet-activating factor. 7. These results provide evidence of a role for platelet-activating factor in the genesis of this model of experimental acute renal failure.\r"

The phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio was lower in patients with heart failure than in control subjects at an exercise rate of 1.5 W, although intracellular pH and blood flow were similar. 3. The cytosolic free adenosine 5'-diphosphate concentration was markedly increased in patients with heart failure exercising at 1.5 W compared with control subjects exercising at the same workload. 4. Although the maximum workload achieved by patients with heart failure was less than half of that reached by control subjects, the pH and the phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio were lower in patients with heart failure at maximal load. Blood flow was less at maximal exercise in patients with heart failure than in control subjects in keeping with the reduced work load. 5. The phosphocreatine depletion induced in the gastrocnemius muscle by exercise was more severe than previously described in the forearm of patients with heart failure. 6. Metabolic abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to exercise intolerance in heart failure, particularly during submaximal exercise.\r"

  ".W": "1. In minimal change nephrotic syndrome the occurrence of heavy proteinuria can be explained on the basis of a reduction in charge selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier, and it has been proposed that this might be caused by the neutralization of anionic groups by a circulating polycationic factor. 2. The effects of two polycations, protamine and poly-L-lysine, on the function of the isolated perfused rat kidney have been examined. 3. Poly-L-lysine polymers of relatively high molecular weight (8800 and 17,800) induced heavy proteinuria, while simultaneously causing a marked increase in renal vascular resistance and a fall in filtration rate. Protamine (approximate molecular weight 7000) at relatively high concentration induced modest proteinuria in the absence of effects on vascular resistance or filtration rate. 4. A poly-L-lysine polymer of lower molecular weight (3800) did not induce proteinuria. Protamine at a concentration of 40 micrograms/ml and below did not affect protein excretion either. Both provoked substantial natriuresis. This appeared to be largely due to an effect on the tubular handling of sodium since the filtration rate remained steady while fractional sodium excretion rose markedly. 5. The natriuretic effect of protamine was blocked by heparin, but not by indomethacin or verapamil, suggesting that the mechanism of natriuresis did not depend upon either prostaglandin production or entry of calcium through verapamil-sensitive channels.\r"

Oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, blood glucose concentration and plasma levels of free fatty acids, glycerol, lactate, dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured. The results were compared with values obtained during infusion over the same time period of the corresponding volumes of 5% (w/v) D-glucose alone. 3. Energy expenditure calculated from the oxygen consumption and the respiratory exchange ratio was higher than control values during infusion of dopamine (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance) specifically at a rate of 10 micrograms min-1 kg-1 (P less than 0.05) when it was 14% higher, but not at a rate 2 of or 5 micrograms min-1 kg-1. The plasma noradrenaline concentration was 74 and 230% and the blood glucose concentration was 21 and 36% higher than control values at 5 and 10 micrograms of dopamine min-1 kg-1, respectively (P less than 0.01). At 10 micrograms of dopamine min-1 kg-1 the plasma free fatty acid concentration was 70% and the plasma glycerol concentration was 80% higher than during the control infusion (P less than 0.01). The respiratory exchange ratio and the plasma lactate concentration were the same in the two groups and did not alter during the dopamine infusion. The plasma adrenaline concentration rose significantly (P less than 0.01), but only transiently, during dopamine infusion at a rate of 2 micrograms min-1 kg-1. 4. Dopamine at low doses has metabolic effects. It increases the blood glucose concentration and the circulating noradrenaline level at an infusion rate of 5 micrograms min-1 kg-1. It increases energy expenditure and circulating free fatty acid and glycerol levels at an infusion rate of 10 micrograms min-1 kg-1, presumably due to stimulation of lipolysis.\r"

  ".W": "1. Blood cells and vascular endothelial cells are subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically generated shear stress forces. In vitro, membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation. 2. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients. 3. Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter, and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1. Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator. The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma. 4. Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02), shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy. In contrast, neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, in vitro per se. 5. In the overall population, strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001), but also between their absolute values, suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport.\r"

To investigate the role of endothelin in Gram-negative bacteraemia and the possible involvement of tumour necrosis factor-alpha in its pathophysiology, we measured plasma and tissue (lung, kidney and spleen) immunoreactive endothelin levels in Gram-negative bacteraemic mice, with and without passive immunization by anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody. 2. Plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels were greatly increased after the Escherichia coli injection. Pretreatment with anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody did not suppress elevated plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels (P greater than 0.1). 3. Lung tissue immunoreactive endothelin levels in mice were increased 16 h after the E. coli injection and were not affected by prior passive immunization with anti-(tumour necrosis factor-alpha) antibody. Immunoreactive endothelin in spleen and kidney was undetectable (less than 34 fmol/g wet weight). 4. Injection of rMu tumour necrosis factor-alpha into mice did not increase plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels. 5. Antibody to endothelin given 30 min after a 90% lethal dose challenge with E. coli did not affect mortality. 6. We conclude that the rise in plasma and tissue endothelin that occurs in Gram-negative bacteraemia is independent of tumour necrosis factor-alpha.\r"

Young and mature erythrocytes from 15 normal subjects were used to compare the sodium pump rate constant measured in whole blood with the more definitive sodium affinity constant and maximum velocity of the sodium pump measured in artificial media using sodium-loaded cells. 2. Similar values were obtained from both erythrocyte fractions for the sodium affinity constant and maximum velocity and also by using two different plots. The median error in the estimate of individual sodium affinity constants and maximum velocities from regression analysis was about 20% and the precision was not improved by combining the data points for the two erythrocyte fractions. 3. The rate constant in whole blood was closely related to the sodium affinity constant and maximum velocity of the sodium pump (r = 0.75), suggesting that it was a reasonable overall assessment of available sodium pump activity. 4. Differences in the rate constant between subjects were due to differences in both the maximum velocity and sodium affinity constant of the sodium pump so that the rate constant could not be used as a guide to the underlying sodium pump physiology.\r"

Erythrocyte sodium content, ouabain-sensitive sodium flux and sodium pump rate constant were measured in whole blood, and the maximum velocity and sodium affinity of the sodium pump were measured in vitro. 3. Erythrocyte sodium content decreased and the sodium pump rate constant increased up to 26 weeks gestation. The increase in rate constant was due to an increase in the affinity of the sodium pump for sodium up to 20 weeks gestation. After 20 weeks gestation there was an increase in maximum velocity and a decrease in sodium affinity of the sodium pump but no further change in the sodium pump rate constant. 4. At 14 weeks gestation the sodium pump rate constant was correlated with both the maximum velocity and sodium affinity constant. After this time the relationship was much more variable and there was no correlation with the sodium affinity constant. The comparison of measurements of the sodium pump in whole blood and in vitro gave no evidence of sodium pump inhibition. 5. The erythrocyte sodium pump changed throughout gestation with different components to the change, but, overall, available sodium pump activity in blood increased and sodium content decreased.\r"
