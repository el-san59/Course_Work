  ".W": "We examined in this work whether rTNF inhibits the capacity of Trypanosoma cruzi to multiply within murine macrophages or enhances the ability of the phagocytic host cells to destroy internalized parasites. We found that rTNF would not alter the fate of the trypanosomes within macrophages over a 48-h incubation period unless the latter cells were also treated with 1 ng/ml bacterial endotoxin (LPS). Treatment of macrophages with rTNF plus LPS, but not separate treatment with either rTNF or LPS, resulted in a significant decrease in the number of organisms per 100 macrophages with respect to values obtained with mock-treated macrophages. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of infected macrophages over the 48-h incubation period, indicating parasite clearance by the host cells. The combined effects of rTNF and LPS were seen when macrophages from CBA/J were used but not with LPS-insensitive macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice. Increased trypanosome killing by CBA/J macrophages treated with rTNF plus LPS was not seen when catalase was present in the culture medium, indicating a role for hydrogen peroxide in the cytotoxic effect. These results show that rTNF can affect the fate of T. cruzi within macrophages if LPS is present and point to destruction of internalized organisms rather than inhibition of parasite multiplication as the most likely explanation.\r"

  ".W": "Sex hormones have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune disorders, presumably through regulatory influences on the immune system. However, the mechanisms of sex steroid action on humoral and cellular immune responses are not precisely understood. In this study, the in vitro effects of physiologic concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone on the Ag non-specific differentiation of human PBMC were examined using optimal and sub-optimal doses, respectively, of PWM. In cultures of PBMC from 14 normal donors (7 men and 7 women, aged 25 to 45 yr), 17 beta-estradiol (0.5 to 30 ng/ml) enhanced PWM-induced generation of PFC by 46% (p less than 0.01), whereas testosterone (10 to 300 ng/ml) inhibited PFC generation by a mean of 36% (p less than 0.001). The enhancing and suppressing effects of the sex steroids on PBMC occurred early inasmuch as estradiol and testosterone had to be added to the cultures at their initiation (6 and 24 h, respectively) in order to observe their influence. Moreover, deletion of the hormones from the cultures after as short a period as 12 h did not obviate their effects. There was no alteration of the kinetics of the response to PWM or an effect on the number of spontaneous PFC generated in vitro in the absence of PWM. In addition, there was no difference among men and women in response to either sex steroid, and within the female group, no variation was observed on different days of the menstrual cycle. These studies demonstrate direct immunoregulatory effects of specific sex steroids on human PBMC and support the idea that these hormones may have a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of some autoimmune disorders.\r"

The heart disease predictive instrument (HDPI) of Pozen et al and the electrocardiogram scoring method of Brush et al were applied to records from all patients with cardiac-related diagnoses admitted to a family practice service. A retrospective review of medical records of all patients admitted with suspected acute ischemic heart disease to a rural community hospital family practice service was conducted. Of 147 patients identified, 108 were admitted primarily for suspected ischemia. Twenty-four myocardial infarctions occurred among these 108 patients (22.2 percent). Patients with HDPI probabilities of less than 50 percent were very unlikely to sustain infarction and in no case required intensive intervention for any problem not apparent at admission. Only 15 instances of the four types of complications that the instrument of Brush et al is designed to predict occurred; this incidence was too low to allow statistical testing. In summary, the heart disease predictive instrument reliably identified patients unlikely to require intensive care services in this population. Because of the low incidence of complications in this population, the instrument described by Brush et al was not found to be clinically useful.\r"

Recently, certain pathophysiological aberrations in hypertensive patients have been shown to be different in blacks and whites. Whether these differences are primary (genetic) or secondary has yet to be resolved. Nevertheless, certain racial differences may have therapeutic implications. Diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy for most hypertensive black patients. beta-Blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not shown great efficacy when used as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. The combination of a diuretic with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors, however, has been shown to abolish black-white differences in drug response. More recently, the calcium channel blockers have been shown to be potentially effective in black hypertensive patients. In spite of the effective drug therapy that is available for hypertensive patients in general, economic and social considerations continue to contribute to the low rate of detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in the black population.\r"

  ".W": "Photoradiation therapy is a form of local treatment that depends on the selective retention of a photosensitizer, such as hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD), by the tumor followed by treatment with light of an appropriate wavelength to activate the sensitizer in the tumor. The selective uptake of HpD by cerebral tumors has been demonstrated both in laboratory animal model studies and in clinical studies, and selective destruction of intracerebral tumors has been demonstrated in animal glioma models. The biological basis for photoradiation therapy and, in particular, the mechanisms for the selective uptake of the sensitizer into the tumor and the destruction of tumor with photoradiation therapy are discussed. Current evidence suggests that singlet oxygen is the major intermediary leading to cell damage, although other radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals may be involved. Other studies suggest that the initial damage is to the blood vessels, and the tumor subsequently undergoes ischemic changes. Sixty-four patients treated with photoradiation therapy have been reported in the literature. The initial clinical studies were disappointing in their therapeutic effect but these studies often included treatment of recurrent gliomas and low doses of light were used. Technical advances, particularly in laser technology, have enabled more effective photoradiation therapy and the clinical trials are reviewed.\r"

When patients were stratified by prerandomization cardiac complications, the advantage increased to 4:1. A multiple logistic model considering treatment and selected baseline variables indicated a significant positive treatment effect of barbiturates, a significant effect of time from injury to randomization, and an interaction of treatment with cardiovascular complications. However, of 925 patients potentially eligible for randomization, only 12% met ICP randomization criteria. The results support the hypothesis that high-dose pentobarbital is an effective adjunctive therapy, but that it is indicated in only a small subset of patients with severe head injury.\r"

  ".W": "Clean surgical procedures carry a risk of postoperative wound infection that is less than 5% in most hospitals. The use of prophylactic antibiotic agents in clean neurosurgical cases is controversial, and the neurosurgical literature through 1980 contains no controlled clinical trials to study its effectiveness in such cases. A report of 1732 consecutive procedures without a single postoperative wound infection in patients receiving systemic gentamicin, vancomycin, and streptomycin irrigation fluids is often quoted by neurosurgeons; however, these results have not yet been duplicated by others. Since 1980, there have been several controlled trials that support the use in clean neurosurgical cases of prophylactic antibiotics, including the vancomycin/gentamicin/streptomycin regimen and the first-generation cephalosporins. A report in 1986 of 1602 cases without a primary wound infection supports the use of a single perioperative dose of cefazolin. A review of causative organisms in postoperative wound infections demonstrates the preponderance of Gram-positive pathogens. Therefore, when antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, adequate Gram-positive bacterial coverage, including protection against Staphylococcus infection, is required. With consideration of the present data, the cost of antibiotic therapy, and the danger of drug toxicity, a short perioperative regimen of cefazolin as prophylaxis is preferred in clean neurosurgical cases.\r"

The authors studied adults with sore throats to determine whether patients can be stratified into higher and lower risks of strep throat by history alone. They first obtained data from 517 patients seen in an emergency room. Providers graded symptoms on a four-point scale (absent, mild, moderate, or severe). Initial analyses showed that prediction based on history should include three variables: fever, difficulty in swallowing, and cough. For ease of computation, these were consolidated into one score, \"history\" (= fever history + difficulty in swallowing - cough). This score was used to develop a model that predicts the probability of infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and the model's performance was tested in two additional patient groups. The predictive accuracy of the \"history\" score was confirmed in all patient groups, despite differences in providers and disease prevalences. Primary care physicians may use this model to help them make decisions in situations such as telephone encounters without using additional data.\r"

Before opening the fascia of the external oblique muscle, the superficial inguinal pouch and area beyond the external ring were explored carefully. Testes beyond the external ring were defined as ectopic. Other positions identified included intracanalicular and intra-abdominal. Of 336 testes 66 per cent were ectopic, 16 per cent intracanalicular, 10 per cent abdominal and 3 per cent absent. Maldescent was unilateral in 254 patients and bilateral in 41. In the unilateral cases of 178 testes were ectopic (70 per cent) and the testis was palpable preoperatively in 158 (89 per cent). Bilateral undescended testes were palpable on both sides preoperatively in 25 of 41 cases (61 per cent), including 16 (64 per cent) ectopic testes. There were 10 cases of bilateral nonpalpable testes and in 8 (80 per cent) both testes were intra-abdominal. Based on the high incidence of ectopic testes and their associated abnormal attachments, it is our prediction that nonsurgical treatment (hormonal) of undescended testes would not be expected to achieve optimal results.\r"

Autonomic ganglia, containing two to 21 nerve cell bodies, were found in the smooth and striated muscle regions of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter; they were present rarely in the distal urethra and were absent from the prostatic urethra. Neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity was observed in some of the nerve cell bodies (diameter 25 to 50 microns). Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide immunoreactivity was observed in small cells (diameter 15 to 25 microns.) in the urethral smooth muscle and in the walls of blood vessels that resembled small intensely fluorescent cells but may be nerve cell bodies. Both neuropeptide Y- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive nerve fibres were found in the smooth muscle and around blood vessels in the urethra of all patients. Both types of peptide-containing nerves were found associated with striated muscle of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter in patients with spinal cord injury, but only vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive nerves were found in the patient with carcinoma of the bladder in this region. The functions of the autonomic ganglia and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves in the human urethra remain to be elucidated.\r"

Response was assessed urodynamically and symptomatically. Thirty women and 3 men (mean age 48 years and mean duration of symptoms 5.5 years) were entered into the study. No significant side effects to dimethyl sulfoxide were noted. When assessed subjectively, 53 per cent of dimethyl sulfoxide treated patients were markedly improved compared to 18 per cent of the placebo treated patients. Of the dimethyl sulfoxide group 93 per cent had objective improvement versus 35 per cent of the placebo group.

Flow cytometric analysis of deparaffinized sections from these specimens as well as a total of 40 representative specimens from normal prostate, and low, intermediate and high grade prostatic carcinomas was performed. Frequency of aneuploidy in low, intermediate and high grade prostatic adenocarcinoma was 0, 43 and 75 per cent, respectively. All cases of prostatic comedocarcinoma studied had distinctly aneuploid deoxyribonucleic acid histograms and the mean deoxyribonucleic acid content in comedocarcinoma was the highest of all groups analyzed. The mean time to recurrence in patients with comedocarcinoma was 13 months. Our flow cytometric data suggest that prostatic comedocarcinoma represents a potentially aggressive tumor demonstrating cytogenetic aberration shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome in prostatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

Information conveyed can take several forms, some better suited to undergraduate medical education, others more applicable to graduate and continuing education. The use of the computer in certification and licensure could, within a decade, transform the way competence is assessed. Its greatest promise, however, may lie in providing pertinent information at the time when, and in the place where, patient care takes place.

Total pancreatectomy in the dog and primate provided a reliable diabetic model, induced an absolute deficiency of insulin and was uniformly lethal if not treated. Continuous administration of CSA in baboons resulted in modest allograft survival. As in baboons, dogs receiving CSA 25 mg/kg/d rendered moderate graft prolongation but a dose of 40 mg/kg/d resulted in significant graft survival (greater than 100 days) in 5 of 8 allograft recipients. Irradiation alone resulted in minimal baboon pancreatic allograft survival of 20 baboons receiving TL1 1,000 rad and CSA, 3 had graft survival greater than of 100 days. Of 15 baboons receiving TL1 800 rad and CSA, 6 had graft survival of greater than 100 days. In conclusion, CSA administration in dogs and TL1 in combination with CSA in baboons resulted in highly significant segmental pancreatic allograft survival.\r"

Five patients were excluded from the study after randomization because of ineligibility or protocol violations. Overall recurrence rates of 55.6% and 36.8% were noted in the surgery and surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy arms, respectively (p = NS). This trend towards a higher recurrence rate in the surgery only arm was in part due to the development of lymph node metastases in the contralateral, nonoperated neck. Thus far, no significant differences in either locoregional or overall survival have been noted between the two treatment arms. In this preliminary analysis, adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy does not appear to improve disease-free or overall survival.\r"

Receptors were not expressed, or expressed at low levels, in vessels of normal tissues. In contrast, a pronounced expression of PDGF B-type receptors was seen on vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques, rejected kidneys, and chronic synovitis. These observations suggest induction of PDGF B-type receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells in inflamed tissues, which would render such cells responsive to growth stimulation by PDGF released from captured platelets, or produced locally (eg, by inflammatory cells or smooth muscle cells). Autocrine or paracrine stimulation of cell growth caused by the effect of PDGF on cells with induced receptors may be important in the formation of the proliferative lesions found in atherosclerosis and in certain forms of chronic inflammation.\r"

In the diabetic patients, plasma glucose levels showed a mean increase of 100% above nadir values in approximately 26 min in response to 7.5 mg intranasal glucagon; hypoglycaemic symptoms were relieved within about 7 min.

The most important factor influencing leukaemia-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse incidence was the stage of the disease at the time of the transplant. This dominant role of the stage of the disease in all three diagnostic categories--acute myeloblastic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia--for all three end-points clearly indicates that resistance of the leukaemia cell to the procedure is more important than bulk of the disease. Additional prognostic factors for leukaemia-free survival and transplant-related mortality were age of the patient, cyclosporin for preventing graft-versus-host disease, and the donor-recipient sex combination. The risk of relapse was highest in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In a multivariate analysis leukaemia-free survival was similar for all three major diagnostic categories and has not changed since the introduction of the European registry in 1979. These results show that the biological differences between the three main diagnostic categories of leukaemia are not as great as had been assumed and that the traditional approaches to improving results in recent years have failed.\r"

As with the dexamethasone suppression test, reviewed elsewhere in this issue, the application of other basal and challenge tests have furthered our understanding of the character of observed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical function in psychiatric patients. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical physiology is complex and plastic and cannot be understood in terms of oversimplified explanations or concepts. Repeated measures over time, involving multiple assessments of axis activity, are essential in understanding the modulating effects of prior activity of the system (induced by endogenous regulatory systems or by superimposed environmental stressors) on the current function of the various levels in this closed-loop axis, where all parts influence the function of the remainder. From such an appreciation and understanding of this system can come more simplified assessments of its function, which would allow application to clinical psychiatry.\r"

Some, such as dexamethasone suppression, may be associated with pharmacokinetic differences in the handling of agonists or may represent a contamination of a schizophrenic population by patients with affective disorders. Other abnormalities, such as the growth hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone and to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in adolescents but not in adults, may reflect developmental changes interacting with disease processes. Still other abnormalities may be more directly reflective of different disease processes: a rapidly neuroleptic-responsive and good-prognosis psychotic disorder appears to be associated with blunted thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone and a blunted growth hormone response to apomorphine; a relatively drug-responsive psychotic disorder whose response requires several weeks of neuroleptic treatment appears to be associated with an excessive growth hormone response to apomorphine. The neuroendocrine windows for viewing brain function in the schizophrenias still permit indistinct images of the processes that modulate their release. Nevertheless, the images may provide important clues to the biopathology underlying these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The dexamethasone suppression test has undergone unprecedented study among the biologic tests proposed for clinical use in psychiatry. Since the 1970s, its study has involved hundreds of reports and thousands of patients. Although important technical aspects of the test appear to be well accepted and validated, additional information is needed regarding the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone. Marked interindividual differences in plasma dexamethasone suggest that performance of the test might be improved by factoring dexamethasone levels into test interpretations. There also may be advantages to the development of a modified test involving other exogenous and index steroids, such as monitoring corticosterone levels. Although it is too early to determine how ROC analysis will alter the clinical application of the test, some implications for methodology and data presentation are already clear. First, because the test is a diagnostic system with nonbinary outcomes, ROC analysis can augment traditional performance indices such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive power. Second, ROC analysis will improve comparisons between the studies of different research groups and will help assess innovations in the application of the test. Third, ROC analytic techniques permit appropriate planning of sample size given estimates of the expected values of AUC that would be obtained from the studies. ROC theory thus promises to play an increasingly important role in the evaluation and future improvement of the dexamethasone suppression test and other biologic markers in clinical psychiatry. In conclusion, neither uncritical enthusiasm nor excessive skepticism is warranted about the use of the dexamethasone suppression test in clinical psychiatry. Evidence to date should encourage investigators to pursue refinement of the test or other tests of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal functioning to increase their accuracy and clinical utility.\r"

These drugs clearly can alter peripheral regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones. In general, psychotropic medications when administered acutely have a tendency to increase the output of both adrenal and pituitary hormones associated with the axis; the benzodiazepines appear to be the exception and indeed may decrease axis activity. Psychotropic agents may also alter the results of the dexamethasone suppression test as currently used in psychiatry, since they alter the neurotransmitters that regulate corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion and also because they may change the severity of the underlying pathophysiology. Withdrawal of these drugs after long-term administration may cause an elevation of these hormones, potentially increasing the false-positive rate of the dexamethasone suppression test and other neuroendocrine tests.\r"

The former studies are more likely to elicit information concerning possible risk factors in suicide, whereas the latter may be better indicators of biologic traits. In both types of investigations, measures taken close to the suicide attempt are more likely to reflect the biologic state of the individual at the time of the behavior. Although the abnormalities present in suicidal individuals are not entirely clear, most evidence to date suggests an overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a dysregulation of both serotonin and adrenergic metabolism. These systems are interrelated. Both animal and human studies have established that a multivariate biologic approach is necessary to the understanding of the pathophysiology of suicide.\r"

A total of 434 infants weighing between 800 and 2000 g were eligible for entry in the study. Of these, 255 were withdrawn - 234 during the first week of the study because breast milk from their mothers became available (123 in the treatment group and 111 in the control group), and 21 because of violations of protocol or because breast milk became available after the first week. The duration of follow-up was 28 days. Among the infants for whom breast milk did not become available during the study, there were no cases of necrotizing enterocolitis among the 88 receiving oral IgA-IgG, as compared with six cases among the 91 control infants (P = 0.0143). Of the infants withdrawn from the study, two assigned to the control group had necrotizing enterocolitis.

Therefore, we randomly assigned 133 patients with cirrhosis of the liver (of alcoholic origin in 66 percent), esophageal varices, and no previous intestinal bleeding to either prophylactic sclerotherapy (n = 68) or no prophylaxis (n = 65). The groups were comparable in hepatic function, endoscopic findings, and the pathogenesis of cirrhosis. All patients who subsequently had a first episode of variceal hemorrhage received sclerotherapy whenever possible. During a median follow-up of 22 months, variceal hemorrhage occurred in 28 percent of the patients receiving sclerotherapy and 37 percent of the controls (P = 0.3). Thirty-five percent of the sclerotherapy group and 46 percent of the control group died. The survival curves (Kaplan-Meier) of both groups were similar (P = 0.2). However, among patients with alcoholic and moderately decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh group B), survival was significantly higher in those receiving sclerotherapy, although the risk of bleeding was only marginally reduced by this procedure. We conclude that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not significantly reduce the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices, but that a subgroup of patients with esophageal varices and moderately decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis may benefit from prophylactic sclerotherapy because of factors not solely attributable to prevention of an initial episode of variceal bleeding.\r"

Cyclosporine was given either orally or intravenously at full doses from the day before transplantation until day 50; it was then tapered off and discontinued on day 180. Trough concentrations of serum cyclosporine were measured by radioimmunoassay. The relation between patients' characteristics and the risk of acute GVHD was analyzed with a relative-risk regression model. In 66 patients (37 percent), grades II to IV of acute GVHD developed 7 to 66 days (median, 13) after transplantation. The trough cyclosporine concentration for a given week was significantly associated with the risk that acute GVHD would develop during the following week. The relative risks were 0.7 (i.e., there was a 30 percent reduction in risk) for every increase of 100 ng per milliliter in cyclosporine concentration and 1.0, 0.60, and 0.20 for concentrations of less than 100, 100 to 199, and 200 or more ng per milliliter, respectively (P less than 0.01). A patient's age, prophylaxis regimen, and year of transplantation also influenced the risk of acute GVHD significantly. These data indicate that low cyclosporine concentrations can be a cause of treatment failure and that concentrations should be monitored in recipients of marrow transplants.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ventricular dilatation continues during the late convalescent phase after myocardial infarction and whether therapy with captopril alters this process. Fifty-nine patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction and a radionuclide ejection fraction of 45 percent or less underwent cardiac catheterization 11 to 31 days after infarction, when they were not in overt congestive heart failure. They were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril and were followed for one year. A repeat catheterization was performed to evaluate interval changes in hemodynamic function and left ventricular volume. Thirty-eight male patients were evaluated with maximal-exercise treadmill tests every three months. No differences were detected at base line in clinical, hemodynamic, or quantitative ventriculographic variables. During one year of follow-up, the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle increased by a mean [+/- SEM] of 21 +/- 8 ml (P less than 0.02) in the placebo group, but by only 10 +/- 6 ml (P not significant) in the captopril group. The left ventricular filling pressure remained elevated with placebo but decreased (P less than 0.01) with captopril. In a subset of 36 patients who were at high risk for ventricular enlargement because they had persistent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, captopril prevented further ventricular dilatation (P less than 0.05). Patients given captopril also had increased exercise capacity (P less than 0.05). This preliminary study indicates that after anterior myocardial infarction, ventricular enlargement is progressive and that captopril may attenuate this process, reduce filling pressures, and improve exercise tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "In the present work, the major correlations among cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsatility, cerebral hemodynamic changes, the action of mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, and the main aspects of the intracranial basal artery transcranial Doppler wave form are critically examined. CSF pulsatility is a consequence of rigidity of the craniospinal compartment and the pulsating changes in cerebral blood volume. At low and medium intracranial pressures (ICPs), changes in CSF pulsatility are mainly the result of changes in craniospinal elastance. During severe intracranial hypertension, however, CSF pulse pressure reflects an abrupt increase in cerebrovascular (i.e., cerebral vessel) compliance. The mechanisms controlling cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume affect CSF pulsatility through both an alteration in craniospinal blood volume and a change in vascular wall pulsatility. Examination of the main parameters of the Doppler velocity pattern (maximal systolic blood velocity, diastolic blood velocity, and peak to peak pulsatility index) in cerebral basal arteries reveals a significant alteration in the velocity wave form during severe ICP increase (above 60 mm Hg). During moderate ICP increase, when cerebral regulatory mechanisms are effective, the Doppler velocity pattern is not significantly affected by ICP changes.\r"

  ".W": "In 21 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured intracranial aneurysms, we performed serial neurological evaluations, transcranial Doppler examinations, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) determinations. We classified 8 patients as having vasospasm (delayed neurological deterioration, appropriate reduction of CBF) and 13 patients as having no spasm on the basis of this information. Transcranial Doppler flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral artery were significantly elevated for the group with vasospasm on posthemorrhage Days 4 through 12. Elevation of transcranial Doppler velocities preceded clinical signs of cerebral ischemia. The maximal transcranial Doppler flow velocities achieved were compared on the basis of the extent of clot on early computed tomographic (CT) scans. The mean anterior cerebral artery flow velocities were significantly different between CT Grades II and III. The initial transcranial Doppler flow velocities were compared on the basis of the patient's Hunt and Hess grade upon admission. The flow velocities for Grade V patients were significantly lower than those for Grade IV patients. Transcranial Doppler flow velocities were compared with arteriographically observed anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery radii in 12 instances. The correlation was poor, but the data should be interpreted cautiously in view of the small number of arteriograms. We conclude that transcranial Doppler examination has considerable potential in the early diagnosis of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (clinical vasospasm) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

We recently saw a patient with low back pain and no spina bifida occulta, in whom adipose tissue was noted in the area of the filum on an unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan. The patient had a tethered cord. This case suggested that, when CT scanning is done as the first imaging study in the evaluation of low back pain, fatty tissue in the area of the filum may be an indicator for tethering of the spinal cord. The present study was undertaken to determine the validity of using CT scan-detectable filal fat in the identification of possible tethered spinal cords among a group of patients experiencing low back pain. The presence of fat in the fila of 12 patients with the radiologically and histologically tethered cord syndrome was evaluated and the fila of 47 autopsied patients whose clinical history showed no back pain were examined histologically. There were accumulations of adipose tissue in the fila of 11 of the 12 (91%) patients with the tethered cord syndrome and in the fila of 9 of the 47 patients (17%) in the autopsy series. Of the 9 autopsy patients with fat in their fila, however only 3 patients (6%) exhibited collections of adipose tissue in the CT detection range (2 mm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A potential advantage of early genetic amniocentesis over chorionic villus sampling is its ability to detect neural tube defects. We obtained 476 amniotic fluid samples between ten and 15 weeks' gestation and analyzed them for karyotype and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); 142 were also tested for acetylcholinesterase. Amniotic fluid AFP levels rose to a peak at 12-13 weeks' gestation and then gradually declined, closely approximating the pattern in fetal blood. The rate of inconclusive acetylcholinesterase results (a faint but true band) was four times higher than that later in pregnancy (10.6 versus 2.46%, respectively). However, the rate of associated fetal congenital anomalies was lower than that later in pregnancy. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in the study group, and the association with low amniotic fluid AFP in early genetic amniocentesis levels was identical to that further along in pregnancy. These data help establish normal values for AFP in early pregnancy. With AFP and cautious interpretation of acetylcholinesterase, early genetic amniocentesis can be used for neural tube defect detection.\r"

The dosage regimen was 25 mg every four hours in four patients and 25 mg every six hours in the other four patients. The maximum duration of indomethacin therapy was 72 hours. In three patients, fetal ductus arteriosus constriction mandated discontinuation of indomethacin at 24 hours. Sonographic assessment of hourly fetal urine output was performed before therapy, at multiple regular intervals during therapy, and 24 hours after the last dose of indomethacin. A dramatic decline was noted from the mean baseline fetal urine output of 11.2 mL/hour. The mean fetal urine output at five, 12, and 24 hours during therapy was 2.2, 1.8, and 1.8 mL/hour, respectively (P less than .05). Twenty-four hours after completion of indomethacin therapy, the mean fetal urine output was 13.5 mL/hour. Poor correlation (r = 0.14, P less than .05) was noted between maternal serum indomethacin levels and hourly fetal urine output. This significant decline in urine output is consistent with other results in neonatal and adult animals and humans. Furthermore, it implies a role for prostaglandins in controlling urine output during fetal life.\r"

Using chi 2 analysis, we found that failure of external version was significantly associated with obesity, descent of the breech into the pelvis, decreased fluid, and fetal back positioned posteriorly. Thirteen women were in active labor; this had no effect on the success rate providing that descent had not occurred. Two factors, descent of the breech into the pelvis and posterior position of the fetal back, had an independent effect on success after controlling for other variables.\r"

Proper application by the use of contemporary techniques may be suitable in most conditions requiring hip replacement. The incidence of acetabular failure in a specific group of patients at risk may warrant experimentation by the use of a noncemented system. The mechanism of failure of low-friction arthroplasty may be multifaceted, but our experience indicates that the mechanisms of failure of the acetabulum have been due to excessive deepening and expansion of the acetabulum, once thought to be fundamental to the procedure. A rudimentary technique of cement pressurization, both in the femur and in the acetabulum, also may have played a part in late failures of this procedure. Early demarcation at the cement-bone interface was prevalent in young and active or heavy individuals. Demarcation and loosening were time-dependent phenomena. Demarcation and loosening also appeared with the aging process and increased osteopenia. A higher incidence of loosening also was observed in young and light-weight individuals, with presumably increased elasticity of the pelvic bone.\r"

Unlike chronic benign pain very little research on the role of biobehavioral factors has been conducted to help explain this paradox. The literature on the role of biobehavioral factors in the cancer pain experience is reviewed. A brief review of epidemiology and pathophysiology is presented. Following this, the biobehavioral literature was organized according to research on psychological characteristics and environmental factors. Research addressing affective, cognitive, behavioral and physiological reactions to pain was also discussed. Despite the paucity of studies, the review suggested the following: (1) personality factors do not appear to play a consistent role in the modulation of pain in cancer patients; (2) the work on environmental influences on cancer pain indicate a weak association between such factors as social network and pain intensity; (3) studies on affective state indicate minimal relationships to pain, and lastly, (4) studies on cognitive responses to pain in cancer patients and their influence on the pain experience have not been conducted. To date, in the areas where biobehavioral factors have been investigated, the findings appear modest. However, many potential variables, e.g., self-esteem, the role of family, the role of models, past or current work environments, social learning factors and responses to pain such as fear, somatization and reattribution have not been explored with cancer patients. While the influence of biobehavioral factors in adult cancer pain appear to be relatively modest, the literature is not extensive. Increased efforts at more precisely determining the input of such factors in cancer pain are warranted, particularly given the role of such variables in other recurrent and chronic pain states.\r"

  ".W": "When opiates are administered by the epidural and spinal routes, itching occurs as a side effect. We reviewed 52 reports in the literature of the use of epidural and spinal opiates to assess the incidence of itching and found an overall incidence of 8.5% in patients receiving epidural opiates, and 46% in patients receiving spinal opiates. The symptom is a recognised, though rare, side effect of systemically administered opiates, and in the case of systemic administration the itching is generalised. In the case of epidural and spinal administration, the itching may be generalised. But often a segmental distribution is demonstrable, centred on the level of injection, or the itching is localised to a particular area such as the nose and face. It is likely therefore, in the latter case, that there is an effect upon the spinal cord itself. Although occasionally spinal opiate-induced itching is extremely troublesome and lessens the value of spinal opiate pain relief, in the majority of cases, the itching is not severe and is treatable with naloxone. However, the frequent occurrence of the symptom and the likelihood of a spinal cord mechanism do provide valuable information about opioid actions, and benefit may be derived from better understanding the phenomenon. This paper states a hypothesis to explain spinal opiate-induced itch and explores the possible mechanisms of the effect.\r"

The Tellegen Absorption Questionnaire was used to assess hypnotic susceptibility for 28 subjects in order to match treatment groups according to sex and susceptibility scores. Tooth pulp stimulation consisted of a 1 sec train of 1 msec pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz, applied at 20 sec intervals to the central incisor. Six stimuli, selected between subject's pain and tolerance thresholds, were presented 3 times each in random order. Cold pressor stimulation consisted of forearm immersion in a circulating water bath maintained at 0-1 degrees C. Subjects made threshold determinations of pain and tolerance and used Visual Analogue Scales to rate the strength and the unpleasantness of both noxious stimuli before and after receiving either hypnosis- or relaxation-induced analgesia. There were no significant differences in pain reductions between hypnosis- and relaxation-induced interventions. However, the percent reduction in both strength and unpleasantness varied significantly as a function of the type of pain. Both hypnosis and relaxation significantly reduced the strength and the unpleasantness of tooth pulp stimulation, but only the unpleasantness dimension of cold pressor pain. The pain reductions were not correlated with subjects' hypnotic susceptibility levels. The results indicate that the extent and the quality of the analgesia produced by these cognitive-based therapies vary not only according to subjects' characteristics and the efficacy of the intervention, but also according to the nature of the noxious stimuli. Tooth pulp and cold pressor stimulation represent qualitatively different stimuli with respect to both the type of nerves activated and the mode of stimulus application. Discrete, randomly presented levels of noxious electrical stimulation to the teeth activate predominantly small fibers and produce brief pain sensations that vary unpredictably in intensity. In contrast, continuous cold stimulation to the forearm activates a variety of nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers and produces progressive cold and pain sensations with a predictable increase in intensity from cold sensations to paresthesia and severe pain.\r"

It was demonstrated that obese adolescents have a BP distribution that is skewed 1 SD to the right of normal (P less than .01), and that with weight loss this distribution was no longer different from that of the general population. It was also shown that a weight loss program that incorporates exercise and caloric restriction produces the most desirable effect on BP reduction (ie, greatest decrease in resting systolic BP and greatest decrease in exercise diastolic and mean BP). Finally, it was demonstrated that obese adolescents have structural changes present in the forearm resistance vessels and that these structural changes are reversed to the greatest extent in the weight loss program that includes exercise.\r"

  ".W": "A characteristic pattern of fluid homeostasis occurs in the first week of life in many preterm infants. Initially, urine output is low independent of fluid intake, subsequently a diuresis occurs, and finally urine output begins to vary with intake. Renal clearance measurements were made during each of these three phases to elucidate the renal mechanisms involved. Periods during which the ratio of urine output to fluid intake was greater than or equal to 1 and urine output was greater than or equal to 3 mL/kg/h were defined as diuretic. Of 22 preterm infants studied from 12 to 120 hours of age, 17 had at least one period of diuresis. In these infants, urine output, fluid intake rate, output to intake ratio, glomerular filtration rate, and fractional sodium excretion were lowest at 12 to 24 hours of age. During diuresis, urine output tripled without a significant change in fluid intake so that output to intake increased to levels exceeding unity. Diuresis was associated with significant increases in glomerular filtration rate and fractional sodium excretion. By 108 to 120 hours of age, urine output decreased despite an increase in fluid intake. This was accompanied by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. These results suggest that the initial antidiuretic phase is the result of a low fractional sodium excretion in the face of a low glomerular filtration rate. Subsequently, diuresis and natriuresis occur as a result of abrupt, nonmaturational increases in glomerular filtration rate and fractional sodium excretion. With cessation of diuresis, glomerular filtration rate and fractional sodium excretion decrease and water and electrolyte output begin to vary appropriately with intake.\r"

It is known that ureteral function is affected by urinary tract infection from studies in experimental animals, as well as through clinical findings in patients with upper tract infection. Whether infection might affect the ability of the ureter to prolong high-grade reflux was questioned. This observation might explain why high-grade reflux does not disappear as rapidly as moderate reflux in children with recurrent urinary tract infections. Vesicoureteral reflux was produced surgically in combination with bladder neck obstruction using infant monkeys. The reflux thus produced was high grade with ureteral dilation and caliectasis. In the group of animals in which the bladder neck obstruction was relieved surgically, the reflux rapidly disappeared. In the other group, a bladder infection was produced with Escherichia coli at the time of release of the bladder neck obstruction. The reflux lasted significantly longer, an average of 18 months. Therefore, it appears that treatment of urinary tract infection rather than vesicoureteral reflux is the most important therapy.\r"

Unusual features present in this family included bilateral nasolacrimal duct fistulas, radial aplasia, and unusual dermal ridge patterns.

It catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to the primary hydroxyl of chloramphenicol. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the type III variant enzyme from Escherichia coli has been determined and refined at 1.75-A resolution. The enzyme is a trimer of identical subunits with a distinctive protein fold. Structure of the trimer is stabilized by a beta-pleated sheet that extends from one subunit to the next. The active site is located at the subunit interface, and the binding sites for both chloramphenicol and CoA have been characterized. Substrate binding is unusual in that the two substrates approach the active site via clefts on opposite molecular \"sides.\" A histidine residue previously implicated in catalysis is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Four cAMP-independent receptor protein mutants (designated CRP* mutants) isolated previously are able to activate in vivo gene transcription in the absence of cAMP and their activity can be enhanced by cAMP or cGMP. One of the four mutant proteins, CRP*598 (Arg-142 to His, Ala-144 to Thr), has been characterized with regard to its conformational properties and ability to bind to and support abortive initiation from the lac promoter. In the absence of cGMP, CRP*598 shows a more open conformation than CRP, as indicated by its sensitivity to proteolytic attack and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-mediated subunit crosslinking. Binding of wild-type CRP to its site on the lac promoter and activation of abortive initiation by RNA polymerase on this promoter are effected by cAMP but not by cGMP. CRP*598 can activate lacP+-directed abortive initiation in the presence of cAMP and less efficiently in the presence of cGMP or in the absence of cyclic nucleotide. DNase I protection (\"foot-printing\") indicates that cAMP-CRP* binds to its site on the lac promoter whereas unliganded CRP* and cGMP-CRP* form a stable complex with the [32P]lacP+ fragment only in the presence of RNA polymerase, showing cooperative binding of two heterologous proteins. This cooperative binding provides strong evidence for a contact between CRP and RNA polymerase for activation of transcription. Although cGMP binds to CRP, it cannot replace cAMP in effecting the requisite conformational transition necessary for site-specific promoter binding. In contrast, the weakly active unliganded CRP*598 can be shifted to a functional state not only by cAMP but also by cGMP and RNA polymerase.\r"

The aspartic acid residues were replaced by asparagines; in addition, Asp-85, -96, -115, and -112 were changed to glutamic acid and Asp-212 was also replaced by alanine. The mutant bacteriorhodopsin genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins were purified. The mutant proteins all regenerated bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophores when treated with a detergent-phospholipid mixture and retinal. However, the rates of regeneration of the chromophores and their lambda max varied widely. No support was obtained for the external point charge model for the opsin shift. The Asp-85----Asn mutant showed not detectable proton pumping, the Asp-96----Asn and Asp-212----Glu mutants showed less than 10% and the Asp-115----Glu mutant showed approximately equal to 30% of the normal proton pumping. The implications of these findings for possible mechanisms of proton translocation by bacteriorhodopsin are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated an unusual codon-specific translational suppressor in Escherichia coli. The suppressor resulted from a spontaneous mutation in a chromosomal gene during a selection for suppressors of the auxotrophic nonsense mutation trpA(UGA211). The suppressor allows readthrough of UGA mutations at two positions in trpA and at two sites in bacteriophage T4. It does not, however, suppress amber (UAG) or ochre (UAA) mutations that were tested in both genomes, some of which were at the same positions as the suppressible UGA mutations. The suppressor also does not allow mistranslation of the UGA-related trpA missense mutations UGG at positions 211 and 234, AGA at 211 and 234, CGA at 211, or UGU and UGC at 234. The suppressor mutation was mapped by genetic procedures to position 89 on the E. coli genetic map. Localization of the suppressor mutation to rrnB was achieved by cloning it in the low-copy-number plasmid pEJM007 by in vivo recombination from the chromosome. Recloning in bacteriophage M13 and subsequent DNA sequence analysis allowed the identification of the suppressor mutation as a deletion of the cytidylic acid residue at nucleotide position 1054 of the 16S ribosomal RNA. The mutant EcoRI-Xba I fragment from the suppressor gene was recloned, from M13, in an otherwise wild-type rrnB in the plasmid pEJM007, and UGA suppression was examined. The UGA-suppressing activity of the reconstructed suppressor-containing pEJM007 was indistinguishable from that of the original recombinant suppressor-containing plasmid. This result demonstrates that the C1054 deletion in 16S rRNA is both necessary and sufficient for UGA suppression. The existence of this mutant suggests an important role for rRNA in codon recognition, at least for accurate polypeptide chain termination.\r"

The chain length of the polyhydroxybutyrate was estimated as 120-200 subunits, and that of the polyphosphate was estimated as 130-170 subunits. The extracted complex, when incorporated into liposomes, exhibited a lipid phase transition in the same temperature range as that of the membrane complex in whole cells as well as the same properties of irreversibility, lability, and sensitivity to chelating buffers. Space-filling molecular models and molecular energy minimization methods (Charmm) were used to develop and evaluate a plausible structure for the complex. It is proposed that the polyhydroxybutyrate forms an exolipophilic-endopolarophilic helix around an inner framework helix of calcium polyphosphate. The calcium ions link the two polymers by forming ionic bonds with phosphoryl oxygens of the polyphosphate and ion-dipole bonds with the ester carbonyl oxygens of the polyhydroxybutyrate. This symmetrical structure forms a channel through the membrane and may play a role in the transport of calcium, phosphate, and DNA.\r"

We demonstrate here that small synthetic peptides can be used as both model substrates and inhibitors to investigate the specificity and molecular parameters of the reaction. The results indicate that a peptide that extends five amino acids but not three amino acids in both directions from a known cleavage site is accurately hydrolyzed by the protease of avian sarcoma-leukosis virus. Substitutions of the amino acids to either side of the peptide bond to be cleaved affect the ability of the peptide (as well as a larger precursor protein) to serve as a substrate. The specificity is more stringent for the amino acid that will become the carboxyl end after cleavage. Some substitutions produced peptides that were not cleaved but could act as inhibitors of cleavage of a susceptible peptide. Thus, small model substrates may be used to explore both the binding and catalytic properties of these important proteases.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of the photosynthetic genes by DNA supercoiling in Rhodobacter capsulatus has been studied by using gyrase inhibitors in vivo and by measurement of mRNA levels of more than a dozen genes. The results demonstrate that the levels of mRNA for light-harvesting (I, II) and reaction center (L, M, H) proteins, bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39), and the mRNAs from the open reading frames Q and R decreased immediately and dramatically upon addition of novobiocin and coumermycin. In contrast, the mRNAs for carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes, the cytochrome bc1 complex, and constitutively expressed mRNA under aerobic conditions for light-harvesting I and for reaction center (L, M) proteins are less sensitive to the inhibitors. In accordance with these results, the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll is markedly repressed by gyrase inhibitors novobiocin, coumermycin, nalidixic acid, and oxolinic acid either under anaerobic conditions or during a shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. The synthesis of light-harvesting (I, II) bacteriochlorophyll complexes is also inhibited by novobiocin and coumermycin. The kinetics of specific mRNA changes and the differential sensitivity of anaerobic and aerobic genes to the gyrase inhibitors strongly suggest that DNA supercoiling is involved in the differential expression of photosynthetic genes in response to the level of oxygen in R. capsulatus.\r"

In analogy to many other viral and cellular enhancers, the insulin enhancer has been shown to be of a mosaic structure and the cis-acting elements of importance for the enhancer activity have been defined. Two short sequences are of crucial importance for the enhancer activity since mutation of either sequence leads to a decrease in activity (by a factor of approximately 10), and the double mutant eliminates all enhancer activity. This study shows that these two major cis-acting elements interact with beta-cell-specific proteins. These two enhancer modules carry an 8-base-pair homology and compete with each other for protein binding, suggesting that they interact with the same protein, designated insulin enhancer binding factor 1 (IEF 1). Since mutation of these sequences eliminates the enhancer activity and protein binding, we propose that IEF 1 is the key regulator controlling the selective activity of the insulin gene enhancer.\r"

If activated by dephosphorylation of Tyr-527, or by other means, p60c-src becomes phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue in the catalytic domain (Tyr-416). To test whether either or both of these tyrosines can be phosphorylated by p60c-src itself, we have created four mutations in c-src. One mutant product can receive but cannot donate phosphate, and other mutants are capable of catalysis but lack phosphorylation sites. The mutant genes were expressed singly or in combination in yeast. Analysis of the phosphorylation of mutant p60c-src in the yeast cells and in immunoprecipitates showed that p60c-src molecules can phosphorylate each other at Tyr-416 and -527. Prohibiting intramolecular phosphorylation had little effect on reaction rates and extents, suggesting that intermolecular phosphorylation predominates. If the same situation pertains in the milieu of the vertebrate fibroblast, phosphorylation of one p60c-src by another at Tyr-416 or -527 could permit positive or negative autoregulation.\r"

The difference is seen in the rate of ternary-complex binding to the ribosome; no differences are seen in peptide-bond formation. Highly expressed mRNAs in Escherichia coli favor codons terminating in cytosine rather than uracil when both codons are read by a single tRNA with an anticodon beginning with guanine.

The alterations included (i) stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity as indicated by elevated levels of glycerophosphoinositol and nonesterified arachidonic acid and (ii) specific uncoupling between surface receptor-mediated stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor, bombesin, or serum and activation of intracellular phospholipase C. These findings suggest the existence of common biochemical pathways for transformation by cytoplasmic and membrane-associated oncogenes and are not consistent with the hypothesis that 21-kDa ras proteins (p21) are direct or distinct regulatory elements of phospholipase C or phospholipase A2 in inositol phospholipid signal transduction pathways.\r"

We have produced via site-directed mutagenesis two Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase mutants (lysine-166 and glutamine-166) to test whether the guanidinium group plays a critical role in catalysis. Comparative kinetic characterization of the lysine-166 and glutamine-166 mutants indicates that the charge at residue 166 is not required for the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters. Small decreases in kcat are observed for both the lysine and glutamine mutants, relative to the wild-type enzyme, but the value for the uncharged glutamine mutant is only one-third that of lysine. Thus, the stabilizing effect of the positively charged guanidinium group does not appear to play a major role in the rate-limiting step for substrate hydrolysis. A significant effect on the Km value is seen only for the glutamine mutant.\r"

This is despite the fact that the basal (unstimulated) levels of InsP3 synthesized in control and EJ-ras-transformed cells are not significantly different. Using the fluorescent indicator fura-2 and digital-imaging techniques, we have visualized and quantified changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in control and EJ-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells in response to PDGF. Within 3 min after exposure of control cells to PDGF, intracellular Ca2+ levels are increased 3- to 9-fold, paralleling the increase in InsP3. In contrast, the majority (greater than 90%) of the EJ-ras-transformed cells show no increase in Ca2+ levels after PDGF exposure and the few that did respond exhibited only a small transient increase. Pronounced differences in the intracellular localization of Ca2+ increases in control and the responding EJ-ras-transformed cells were also observed. Despite the inhibition of InsP3 synthesis and subsequent Ca2+ mobilization, the EJ-ras-transformed cells respond mitogenically to PDGF. These data do not support the hypothesis that the EJ-ras gene product (p21) stimulates a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C in NIH-3T3 cells; instead they suggest that the EJ-ras p21 may uncouple the PDGF receptor from phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of PDGF-stimulated activity of phospholipase C, InsP3 synthesis, and Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

Serial observations of interleukin 3-supported cultures revealed sequential emergence and subsequent degeneration of clusters of cells. These observations suggest that the primary targets of interleukin 3 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor are multipotent progenitors at the early stages of development rather than cells in the terminal process of maturation.\r"

A similarly high conversion rate from Vi+ to Vi- occurs in Escherichia coli HB101 harboring pWR127, a plasmid that contains the 18-kilobase-pair (kb) viaB region cloned from WR7004. However, the Vi- state in HB101 harboring pWR127 was so stable that transition to the Vi+ state was not detected (less than 10(-10) per bacterium per generation). When pWR127 DNA derived from Vi- strains of HB101 harboring pWR127 was transformed in HB101 recipient, a small number of Vi+ transformants were seen among the transformants, which were predominantly Vi-. The viaB region consists of two EcoRI digestion fragments, A (8.6 kb) and B (9.4 kb). A discrete 700- to 800-base-pair DNA element was found to be inserted in the EcoRI B fragment of the viaB region of pWR127 when derived from Vi- strains. However, no such DNA element was found in the pWR127 DNA isolated from Vi+ strains. This discrete DNA element inserts into a recombinational hot spot 1.1 kb from the end of the EcoRI B fragment and behaves as an insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-like element. The insertion of this IS1-like element in the viaB region thus disrupts expression of the Vi antigen. Restoration of Vi expression results when this element is excised.\r"

  ".W": "By using a shuttle vector system developed in our laboratory, we have carried out studies on the molecular mechanism by which 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) induces mutations in mammalian cells. The target for mutagenesis in these studies was the Escherichia coli gpt gene that was contained within a retroviral shuttle vector and integrated into chromosomal DNA in mouse A9 cells. Shuttle vector-transformed cells expressing the gpt gene were mutagenized with BrdUrd and cells with mutations in the gpt gene were selected. Shuttle vector sequences were recovered from the mutant cells, and the base sequence of the mutant gpt genes was determined. The great majority of the BrdUrd-induced mutations involving single-base changes were found to be G.C----A.T transitions. We have shown that mutagenesis by BrdUrd depends upon perturbation of deoxycytidine metabolism. Thus, the current results suggest that BrdUrd mutagenesis involves mispairing and misincorporation of BrdUrd opposite guanine in DNA, driven by nucleotide pool perturbation caused by BrdUrd and the resulting imbalanced supply of triphosphates available for DNA synthesis. The results also revealed a very high degree of sequence specificity for the BrdUrd mutagenesis. BrdUrd-induced G.C----A.T transitions occurred almost exclusively in sequences with two adjacent guanine residues. Furthermore, in approximately equal to 90% of the cases, the guanine residue involved in mutation was the one in the more 3' position.\r"

X double-stranded RNA has all the cis sites necessary to be transcribed, encapsidated, and replicated. We have cloned X double-stranded RNA and sequenced it. The complete X double-stranded RNA sequence deduced indicates that the first 25 bases of the X plus-strand 5' end originated from the 5' end of the L-A plus strand and that most, if not all, of the rest comes from the 3' end of the L-A plus strand. The X plus strand made by X double-stranded RNA-containing virus-like particles binds specifically to empty open virus-like particles and is converted by these particles to X double-stranded RNA. RNA transcripts of the X complementary DNA clones and deletion derivatives thereof were made in vitro by T7 and T3 RNA polymerases and tested for specific binding to the virus-like particles. The results suggest that the binding is due to the sequence UUUGGCCAGG, 370 bases upstream from the X plus-strand 3' end. This sequence is also present in the M1 plus strand 140 bases from its 3' end.\r"

  ".W": "The CDC28 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a protein kinase that is required for passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We have used an inducible promoter fused to the CDC28 coding sequence to isolate conditionally dominant mutant alleles of CDC28. Overexpression of these dominant alleles causes arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle but permits the distinctive asymmetric growth that is characteristic of recessive temperature-sensitive cdc28 mutants. The dominant alleles encode products with no detectable protein kinase activity, and their phenotypic effects can be suppressed by simultaneous overproduction of the wild-type protein. DNA sequence analysis showed that the mutant site in at least one of the dominant alleles is in a residue that is highly conserved among protein kinases. These properties are best understood if the dominant mutation results in the catalytic inactivation of the protein kinase but still allows the binding of another component needed for CDC28 function. By this model, high levels of the mutant protein arrest cell division by denying the wild-type protein access to this other component. Suppressors that may encode this other component have been isolated on high-copy-number plasmids.\r"

One T-cell line was a herpesvirus ateles transformant, the other T-cell line was a human T-cell leukemia virus I transformant, and the macrophage line was a simian virus 40 transformant. After infection with a high-titered HIV-1 stock, the rabbit cultures exhibited properties that closely mimic those of HIV-1-infected human cells. Productive infection was evident in cultures 7-14 days after infection, as shown by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity, a concomitant increase in positive cells detected by indirect immunofluorescence using serum from a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and a decrease in cell viability. RNA gel blot hybridization and protein immunoblot analyses of infected cells indicated that all predicted viral transcripts and proteins were synthesized during the course of the infection. Proof that cell-free culture supernatants of the infected rabbit cell lines contained infectious virus was given by successful passage onto a susceptible human T-cell line. The ability of HIV-1 to infect transformed rabbit cell lines in vitro suggests that, with appropriate manipulation, the rabbit may provide a model for infection with HIV-1.\r"

Ecotropic and amphotropic virus was produced after transfection of this vector into psi-2 and PA-12 packaging cell lines. This virus conferred the full phenotype of multidrug resistance on mouse and human cell lines. Viral titers of up to 2 X 10(5) drug-resistant colonies per ml were observed. Infected cells became resistant to colchicine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, VP16 (etoposide), and puromycin, but not cisplatin, indicating that the presence of the human MDR1 gene is sufficient to cause multidrug resistance. When the dog kidney cell line MDCK was infected with the MDR1 virus, P-glycoprotein was expressed in a polarized manner on the upper surface of the cells, showing that the cloned cDNA also encodes information for polarized expression of P-glycoprotein. The MDR1 virus should be useful for introducing this drug resistance gene into a variety of cell types for biological experiments in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Antisera raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide representing residues 1-26 and a peptide from which residues 20-22 had been omitted during synthesis were capable not only of opsonizing type 1 streptococci but also of reacting in immunofluorescence tests with human renal glomeruli. The cross-reactions were completely inhibited by the immunizing peptides. By using additional synthetic peptides in these inhibition studies, the glomerular cross-reactive epitope was localized to a tetrapeptide sequence Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg at positions 23-26. A number of synthetic M1 peptides containing the tetrapeptide sequence were inhibitory, whereas the M1 peptides lacking the sequence or unrelated tetrapeptides Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser or Arg-Gly-Phe-Ser were without effect. Furthermore, Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg affinity-purified antibodies reacted with renal glomeruli, and the reactivity was inhibited by the tetrapeptide as well as by type 1 M protein. These results indicate that a renal glomerular autoimmune epitope resides in a tetrapeptide Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg near the amino terminus of type 1 streptococcal M protein.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined glutamate receptor desensitization in voltage-clamped embryonic chicken spinal cord neurons and postnatal rat hippocampal neurons maintained in culture. Rapid currents that rose in 0.8-3.6 msec were evoked when glutamate was ionophoresed with 0.5- to 1.0-msec pulses. With prolonged pulses or brief, repetitive pulses, glutamate-evoked currents decayed rapidly in a manner that was independent of holding potential. A similar desensitization occurred following close-range pressure ejection of glutamate. The rapid, desensitizing glutamate current exhibited a linear current-voltage relation and it was not blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, suggesting that it was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate-insensitive (G2) receptors. Desensitization of G2 receptors may be agonist-dependent: currents evoked by kainate, a selective G2 agonist, did not decay, whereas prior application of glutamate did reduce the size of kainate responses. The appearance of the rapid current depended critically on the position of the ionophoretic pipette. Such glutamate-receptor \"hot spots\" often corresponded to points of contact with neighboring neurites, which raises the possibility that they are located at synapses.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of venous air embolism exists whenever the craniofacial operative field is above the level of the heart. Craniotomy with the high-torque craniotome is hypothesized to have produced venous air embolism in the patient described in this report. The diagnosis of venous air embolism is determined by transesophageal Doppler probe, transesophageal echocardiogram or external echocardiogram, and end-tidal N2 and CO2 determinations. Treatment includes control of the air entry sites, aspiration of air from the right atrium via a catheter placed prior to operation, and discontinuing nitrous oxide. If these measures are unsuccessful, the operative field should be transposed below heart level and the procedure terminated. In the event of significant hemodynamic compromise, closed cardiac massage should be tried; if that fails, open cardiac massage and direct aspiration are necessary. The true incidence of venous air embolism in craniofacial operations may be much higher than previously suspected. We therefore recommend placement of appropriate monitoring equipment to detect intracardiac air in those major craniofacial procedures in which there is a potential for intravascular air ingress.\r"

In group 1 (skeletal types I and IIA), 10 children underwent elongation and lengthening of the mandible. In group 2 (skeletal types IIB and III), 10 children had total construction of a new temporomandibular joint and mandibular ramus with rib grafts and costochondral junction. In both groups, an open bite was created on the affected side to provide space for tooth eruption and downward growth of the middle face. The mean follow-up was 50.9 months (18 to 117 months) in group 1 and 45 months (18 to 50 months) in group 2. Analysis of our early results showed that all patients have had downward growth of the midface on the affected side. All five patients in group 1, followed to complete closure of the surgically created open bite, have maintained a level occlusal plane. In group 2, the one patient followed to completion of facial growth continues to have a level occlusal plane and facial symmetry. Appropriately timed mandibular construction and/or elongation in children with hemifacial microsomia is safe and effective. There is a decrease in secondary deformity on the affected side, and the eventual overall facial growth is optimized. Some group 2 children will need secondary elongation and augmentation of the mandible. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that early mandibular correction may obviate the need for maxillary and orbital procedures in adulthood.\r"

Cultured grafts were bordered from subepidermal granulative tissue with basement membrane. A rete ridge and the adnexal structures were absent in the specimens that adhered to the burn wounds. However, in the specimens that took on abraded wounds, a gently sloping rete ridge and elastic fibers were seen. The histologic findings showed structures resembling normal skin.\r"

The efficacy of MR in the evaluation of inflammatory lesions must, therefore, be compared to CT in order to accurately asses its role.\r"

Gd-DTPA improves conspicuity, helps characterize and delineate the extent of lesions, and increases the sensitivity for detection of cerebral abnormalities.\r"

Doppler ultrasound was also used during the last 7 months of the study, but this procedure did not alter the results obtained with CU alone. Incidental findings (eg, Baker cysts, aneurysms, and lymph nodes) were noted in 42 patients and were thought to be nonthrombotic causes of leg swelling or pain that could not be detected with venography. The reliability and clinical acceptance of CU as a means of diagnosing lower-extremity DVT resulted in a 50% yearly reduction in venography, with a concomitant 130% increase in the number of cases of DVT diagnosed.\r"

Excellent correlations between results from the UIC images, MR images, and tissue specimens were demonstrated. Although the current prototype is too large to be useful in examination of smaller vessels such as coronary arteries, the signal-to-noise ratio and resolution obtained indicate that imaging with intravascular UICs is feasible and may have significant diagnostic value.\r"

Sonographic findings were correlated with surgical results and clinical outcome. When performed under these circumstances, sonography was accurate in demonstrating presence or absence of aneurysm (98%), but its sensitivity for extraluminal blood was poor (4%). A combination of sonographic confirmation of aneurysm, abdominal pain, and unstable hemodynamic condition resulted in the correct decision to perform emergent surgery in 21 of 22 patients (95%). An abbreviated sonographic examination done in the emergency room can provide accurate, useful information about the presence of aneurysm; this procedure does not significantly delay triage of these patients.\r"

The tumors tended to be large (11 were greater than 8 cm), were well encapsulated, and occurred less frequently in the pelvic retroperitoneal space (six cases) than in abdominal retroperitoneum (11 cases). All tumors were bulky enough to displace part of the gastrointestinal tract, with only two being inoperable. The most distinctive radiologic feature was hypervascularity (found on 11 of 11 angiograms). Other nondiscriminating radiologic features included well-defined margins and necrosis, with nondistinctive amorphous calcification identified in one case. Angiographic or computed tomographic demonstration of hypervascularity in a retroperitoneal tumor is more suggestive of hemangiopericytoma than of a liposarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma, two of the more common tumors of this region.\r"

Serial studies were performed on the anterior cerebral artery in 55 infants before and during ECMO bypass, and on the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs) on an additional nine infants. The onset of ECMO was associated with changes in character of pulsatile flow, direction of flow, and mean blood-flow velocity. Pulsatility decreased in all patients, and mean blood-flow velocity increased in 73% of patients (mean change from baseline, 87%). Despite retrograde flow in the right ICA in five of nine infants, antegrade flow to the right MCA was preserved in all cases. We found no correlation between alterations in mean blood-flow velocity and overall mortality, frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and neuro-developmental outcome. These data suggest that wide variations in cerebral blood flow occur with ECMO therapy, and that these changes appear to be well tolerated.\r"

On histologic studies, the nonneoplastic cysts were related to the spermatic ducts (rete testis, efferent ductules) and frequently appeared as postinflammatory alterations. Only five patients with intratesticular cysts were followed up with US, and no changes occurred. The combination of clinical and US findings facilitated the differentiation between nonneoplastic and neoplastic testicular cysts.\r"

MR images were obtained of breasts of 120 women who underwent xeromammography. T1 values were determined for masses larger than 2 cm. Cancer was histologically confirmed in 39 breasts and was considered excluded from 81 due to results of biopsy, cyst aspiration, or sonography or absence of change in xeromammographic findings over time. Images were blindly interpreted by three observers, and results were expressed as receiver operating characteristic curves. Detectability of breast cancer was substantially better with xeromammography than with MR imaging for all observers (P less than .03, 10(-6), and .001). On MR images, spiculation of a mass, distorted architecture, skin thickening, and nipple or skin retraction were specific but relatively insensitive indicators of cancer. Masses with smooth, distinct margins and signal intensity greater than that of fat on T2-weighted images were always benign. Other findings and T1 values were not diagnostically useful. The authors conclude that xeromammography is superior to MR imaging in detection of breast cancer.\r"

To predict IUGR more reliably, the authors developed a multiparameter approach based on sonographic and clinical data from 62 fetuses with IUGR and 91 normal fetuses. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the combination of sonographically estimated fetal weight, amniotic fluid volume, and maternal blood pressure status best correlates with the presence or absence of IUGR and produced an IUGR scoring system based on these three parameters. The scoring system, which has a range of 0-100, was tested on a second set of fetuses (47 with IUGR, 81 normal) to determine its performance characteristics. An IUGR score below 50 virtually excludes the diagnosis of IUGR (0.9% likelihood of IUGR, or negative predictive value of 99.1%). A score above 75 allows confident diagnosis of IUGR (positive predictive value, 82%). A score of 50-75 is equivocal, in that it is associated with an intermediate (24%) likelihood of IUGR. The IUGR score is a practical tool that can be easily used in any ultrasound facility.\r"

  ".W": "A 30-amino-acid segment of C/EBP, a newly discovered enhancer binding protein, shares notable sequence similarity with a segment of the cellular Myc transforming protein. Display of these respective amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The periodic array of at least four leucines was also noted in the sequences of the Fos and Jun transforming proteins, as well as that of the yeast gene regulatory protein, GCN4. The polypeptide segments containing these periodic arrays of leucine residues are proposed to exist in an alpha-helical conformation, and the leucine side chains extending from one alpha helix interdigitate with those displayed from a similar alpha helix of a second polypeptide, facilitating dimerization. This hypothetical structure is referred to as the \"leucine zipper,\" and it may represent a characteristic property of a new category of DNA binding proteins.\r"

This binding site is mutated in five out of seven Burkitt lymphomas sequenced to date. To investigate the protein-recognition region in greater detail, the abnormal c-myc allele from a Burkitt lymphoma line (PA682) that carries a t(8;22) chromosomal translocation was used. A point mutation in the binding region of the PA682 c-myc DNA abolished binding of this nuclear protein. This protein may be an important factor for control of c-myc expression, and mutations in its recognition sequence may be associated with c-myc activation in many cases of Burkitt lymphoma.\r"

A soluble astrocyte mitogen inhibitor, immunologically related to the EGF receptor, is present in rat brain. Injury to the brain causes a time-dependent reduction in the levels of this inhibitor and the concomitant appearance of EGF receptor on the astrocyte surface. Intracerebral injection of antibody capable of binding the inhibitor caused the appearance of numerous reactive astrocytes. EGF receptor-related inhibitors may play a key role in the control of glial cell division in both normal and injured brain.\r"

The use of NRS as a medium supplement during initial culture, cloning, and stabilization of RMHs enables production of considerably more specific rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb)-secreting RMHs than have previously been reported.\r"

Nissen complications resulted in recurrent reflux (86 per cent), severe dysphagia (60 per cent), esophageal dysmotility (48 per cent) and gastric perforation and fistualization (5 per cent). The \"classic\" Nissen fundoplication involves a blind 360 degree wrap, which includes the acid-producing parietal cell mass. The resulting pouch drains poorly and is, therefore, subject to gastric ulceration. Reoperation at our institution, using principally the Hill antireflux procedure, gave excellent or good results in 86 per cent, fair in 9 per cent and poor in 5 per cent. Three operative deaths (2.6 per cent) and one late death (0.9 per cent) occurred.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the value of the pelvic part of the radical dissection of the groin, the histories of 23 patients with Stage II (UICC) melanoma with histologically proved metastases of the iliac or obturator lymph nodes, or both, were studied. Histologically proved primary melanomas were found in 19 patients, 18 were localized on the leg and one on the trunk. In four patients, the primary melanoma was unknown. Seven patients had received adjuvant radiotherapy. The time between node dissection and the moment of analysis was two years for 17 patients, five years for 11 patients and ten years for ten patients. Calculated actuarially, 42 per cent of the patients were still without distant metastasis after two years and 32 per cent after five and ten years. At the time of the analysis, ten patients were alive, nine without evidence of disease and three having survived for more than five years. Remarkably, the primary tumor of all three patients was \"unknown\" and they had all had adjuvant radiotherapy. In pooling the data of this series with those from the literature, it appears that, of 78 patients with Stage II melanoma and deep node involvement, 12 had a disease-free survival time of more than five years after therapeutic radical groin dissection. Involvement of deep nodes does not always seem to equate with systemic disease. We think that, when there is an indication for a therapeutic groin dissection, an en bloc superficial and deep lymph node dissection is warranted.\r"

In recent years, clonal deletion theories have gradually given way to more dynamic views of the regulation of anti-self immune reactions. It is now clear that self-reactive B cells and some self-reactive T cells persist in the body, and there is every reason to believe that antigen-presenting cells are fully capable of presenting self-antigens in the same manner as foreign antigens. The critical event in the induction of autoimmune disease, therefore, is the quantitative balance of active suppression v the induction of self-reactive help. This help provided a helper T cell response requires that the self-antigens be presented in the context of self-MHC with sufficient affinity and avidity. The antireaction must be potent enough to overcome the totality of suppressive factors, including specific and non-specific suppressor T cells and anti-idiotypic or anti-T-cell-receptor responses.\r"

An adequate well-organized exposure of the pathologic condition involved, detailed knowledge of the regional anatomy and its variations, careful gentle dissection of the major vessels, and a calm disposition of the surgeon are the critical factors in preventing intraoperative hemorrhage. Unexpected bleeding is at times unavoidable, and the urologic surgeon should have a well-prepared method for managing hemorrhage during each procedure. Temporary control with gauze packs, sponge sticks, or the surgeon's finger should be the initial step in the control of serious hemorrhage, and this will virtually stop most bleeding. The subsequent period should be used to communicate with the anesthesiologist, who must replace the blood already lost and forewarn the blood bank of future needs. The surgeon is obligated to improve exposure of the bleeding site, dissect out the vessel involved, obtain any additional necessary lighting and suction equipment, and call for a colleague to help secure the vascular rent while applying continued proximal and distal tamponade. Because serious intra-operative hemorrhage can be encountered by even the most skilled surgeon, consultation with an experienced colleague should be looked on as an integral part of the armamentarium for the optimal care of the urologic patient.\r"

It will be of interest to see whether newer generation lithotripters will produce an incidence of complications similar to that of the Dornier HM-3 or whether unique problems will call for new strategies. We have described the clinically important complications of ESWL and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. At this time, these modalities should be looked on as complementary procedures.

The ileal or colon conduit still serves as the standard method of urinary diversion in adults with pelvic malignancy. Prevention of these complications should truly begin in the preoperative period, and careful judgement should be used postoperatively so that no therapeutic option is undertaken too early. The goal in managing these complications is the preservation of renal function, the maintenance of longest possible amount of functioning bowel, and the absence of indwelling stents and tubes. Patience is needed, along with the maintenance of drainage, adequate nutrition, observation for and treatment of sepsis, and a careful delineation of the anatomic defects. These patients, with their high reoperative mortality rate (approximately 50 per cent), present one of the most intriguing and complicated challenges to the urologist. Using the principles outlined here, we have had only one death in 22 consecutive patients referred to the Lahey Clinic for the management of complex bowel and urinary tract complications following urinary diversion.\r"

The ability of antihypertensive treatment to reduce these complications in the elderly is now well established. However, several aspects of the treatment of hypertension are being evaluated. In particular, there is a growing trend to avoid individualizing the choice of medication. This is of particular concern in older patients who may differ in the pathophysiology of their hypertension, in their accompanying medical conditions, and in how they may respond to antihypertensive drugs. In addition, elderly hypertensives are often taking a number of medications in addition to antihypertensive drugs. This, along with the fact that the elderly often metabolize drugs more slowly, makes this group particularly susceptible to drug-drug interactions and pharmacologically induced toxic side effects. Considering these points, it appears that the calcium channel blockers are attractive antihypertensive agents for the elderly population.\r"

Diabetes and hypertension have been associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women. Neuropathy, vascular insufficiency and psychological problems have been implicated in impotence, impaired ejaculation and decreased libido in men and in decreased vaginal lubrication, orgasmic dysfunction and decreased libido in women. Several investigations of women with diabetes suggest fewer reports of sexual dysfunction than have been reported by diabetic men. However, there have been few evaluations of sexual dysfunction in women and no standard methods for assessment. Antihypertensive agents, especially diuretics, sympathetic inhibitors and beta-blocking agents have been associated with sexual dysfunction due to autonomic and hormonal effects. An estimated 40 to 80% of diabetic hypertensives have reported sexual dysfunction in several investigations. Clearly, the diabetic hypertensive patient should be evaluated for sexual dysfunction, and appropriate therapy, including changes in medication or referral for sex counseling, should become routine in clinical care.\r"

Diuretic therapy is particularly appropriate for the salt-sensitive hypertensive patient. However, diuretic-induced electrolyte abnormalities may lead to ventricular arrhythmias, even in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs may change circulating lipoprotein levels, which may influence the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be monitored when antihypertensive drugs are administered that can cause hyperlipidemia. Weight reduction and diet therapy should be used because these may have a greater effect on reducing hyperlipidemia, though choice of antihypertensive agents is important. In addition, glucose tolerance may worsen with thiazide therapy, perhaps because newer evidence suggests that insulin resistance is common in essential hypertension. This glucose intolerance may be corrected with potassium repletion or substitution of bumetanide for thiazide. The calcium antagonists may be substituted for diuretic therapy, or other classes of antihypertensive drugs may be used with a reduced dose of diuretic drug if these metabolic changes persist. Thus, attention to metabolic changes may be as important as blood pressure reduction in treatment of the salt-sensitive hypertensive patient.\r"

  ".W": "Essential hypertension remains a significant contributor to mortality, despite treatments effective in decreasing blood pressure. A major reason mortality remains high may be that the conventional stepped-care approach does not always reduce blood pressure in a physiologic manner, which may result in metabolic derangements and elicitation of undesirable reflex mechanisms. Use of the stepped-care approach does not take into account fundamental hemodynamic differences associated with a hypertensive patient's age, race and weight. A nonphysiologic approach in the use of antihypertensive agents may be associated with progression of left ventricular hypertrophy, metabolic derangements, arrhythmias, sudden death, and increased atherosclerotic and nephrosclerotic complications. Considerations of the alterations in cardiovascular structure that can occur in light of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system and transcellular calcium flux are discussed as to how they affect long-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "Despite improved patient detection and pharmacologic therapy, the effect of treatment of hypertension on mortality from coronary artery-related events remains unresolved. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a known consequence of hypertension, is associated with an excess mortality independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, LV hypertrophy accompanying hypertension has been associated with ominous ventricular arrhythmias. However, it does not necessarily follow that regression of LV hypertrophy will reduce this increased mortality. Diastolic dysfunction, manifested by reduced ventricular distensibility of the hypertrophying left ventricle, appears to be an early characteristic of the hypertensive heart since echocardiographic techniques have demonstrated diastolic filling abnormalities in untreated essential hypertensives even before significant LV hypertrophy appears. Not all antihypertensive agents diminish LV mass and improve diastolic dysfunction. Certain sympatholytic agents, calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to diminish LV hypertrophy. However, future studies are needed to determine if these agents that appear to reverse findings of LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic dysfunction will also reduce risk of coronary artery disease and related events.\r"

  ".W": "Aging in industrialized societies is accompanied by increases in the incidence and prevalence of hypertension, with a disproportionately greater increase occurring among aging blacks than among aging whites. This geriatric hypertension is generally of a salt-sensitive nature with a disproportionate frequency of isolated systolic hypertension. Although salt-taste acuity declines with age, salt sensitivity among the elderly does not appear to result from a compensatory increase in salt intake. Rather, age-related increases in salt sensitivity result, in part, from a reduced ability to appropriately excrete a salt load, which is due to a decline in renal function and to a reduced generation of natriuretic substances such as prostaglandin E2 and dopamine. Age-associated declines in the activity of membrane sodium/potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na/K-ATPase) may also contribute to geriatric hypertension because this results in increased intracellular sodium that may cause reduced sodium-calcium exchange and thereby increase intracellular calcium and vascular resistance. Reductions in cellular calcium efflux due to reduced calcium-ATPase activity may similarly cause an increase in intracellular calcium and vascular resistance. Increasing dietary calcium intake may represent an effective nonpharmacologic treatment for some salt-sensitive persons because it appears to reduce intracellular calcium by (1) suppressing parathyroid hormone-mediated calcium influx, (2) increasing Na/K-ATPase activity, and (3) reducing intravascular volume due to calcium-induced natriuresis.\r"

Electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy were tested using increased LV wall thickness, LV enlargement and increased LV mass (all determined echocardiographically) as diagnostic standards. Electrocardiographic criteria for RV hypertrophy were tested using echocardiographic RV enlargement or RV hypertrophy as a diagnostic standard. Sensitivity values for the electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy ranged from 0 to 13%, 0 to 20% and 0 to 12% using echocardiographic increased LV wall thickness, LV enlargement and increased LV mass, respectively, as diagnostic standards. Specificity values ranged from 73 to 100%, 87 to 100% and 83 to 100%, respectively, using these diagnostic standards. Sensitivity values for the electrocardiographic criteria for RV hypertrophy ranged from 0 to 16% and specificity values ranged from 95 to 100%. Combining electrocardiographic criteria within groups did not appreciably increase sensitivity and often decreased specificity to unacceptably low levels. The electrocardiogram is very limited in its ability to detect ventricular hypertrophy and chamber enlargement in morbidly obese patients.\r"

Forty-two patients received 30 U of APSAC intravenously over 5 minutes and 43 patients received 250,000 IU of streptokinase given via intracoronary infusion over 90 minutes, after occlusion of the infarct-related vessel was demonstrated by angiography. Reperfusion was achieved in 23 (64%) of 36 patients (mean time to reperfusion 46 minutes) treated with APSAC and 25 (67%) of 37 patients (mean time to reperfusion 45 minutes) treated with intracoronary streptokinase, who were angiographically evaluated 90 minutes after the start of treatment. Twenty-four hours after treatment, reocclusion had occurred in 1 (5%) of 22 patients in the APSAC group and in 3 (13%) of 23 patients in the streptokinase group. No major bleeding was observed in either treatment group despite a similar systemic lytic state that lasted for up to 48 hours. Two patients treated with APSAC died after severe left ventricular failure unrelated to therapy. The results indicate that APSAC given intravenously is as effective as streptokinase given intracoronary in producing thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. The major advantages of APSAC are its rapid and convenient administration by a single intravenous injection, the low rate of arterial reocclusion and good patient tolerance.\r"

This study investigated the effect of guar therapy in 50 men with moderately elevated plasma cholesterol who were randomized to an 8-week study of guar therapy. Three forms of guar gum were used: a medium viscosity solid or liquid form, a high viscosity liquid form or placebo. When the medium viscosity guar therapy groups were combined, 4 weeks of therapy were shown to result in a substantial reduction in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 25 mg/dl and 23 mg/dl (p = 0.035 and 0.12), respectively. The high viscosity guar group had a reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 37 and 30 mg/dl, respectively (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.02). Following 8 weeks of therapy, a return toward baseline values was observed. No significant changes were demonstrated in blood chemistries, triglyceride values, total high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or the HDL2 fraction of HDL cholesterol. The effect of the solid and liquid forms of guar on plasma cholesterol reduction was similar. This study shows that a nonpharmacologic dietary additive reduces plasma total and LDL cholesterol.\r"

The central and regional hemodynamic effects and responses in renal function were determined and compared with those of saline-placebo control patients in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Dopexamine significantly increased cardiac output at a dose greater than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/kg/min secondary to an increase in stroke volume at greater than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/kg/min and heart rate at greater than or equal to 0.50 micrograms/kg/min. Dopexamine evoked a significant decrease in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, with mild reductions noted for systemic and pulmonary diastolic pressures. Right and left ventricular filling pressures decreased over the entire dose range of dopexamine concomitant with a demonstrable improvement in the indexes of ventricular performance. Dopexamine preferentially increased visceral (renal, hepatic-splanchnic) blood flow over that of limb. Urine volume and sodium excretion increased slightly with dopexamine. Dopexamine elicits rather prominent vasodilating effects (particularly of visceral vascular beds), some positive inotropy and chronotropy and favorable responses in renal function.\r"

Telephone interviews with parents were used to assess knowledge of home asthma care and the type of care prescribed by the child's physician. Medicaid and hospital records were used to measure acute care utilization. Eighty-eight children (aged 0 to 5 years) who had made more than two emergency room visits for asthma were recruited by telephone. Fifty-six prescribing errors were identified, 24 being failure to prescribe an additional drug for short-term use by children receiving continuous therapy. Acute care use dropped 50% compared with a control period. This type of program is feasible but may require in-person recruiting to reach high-risk families without telephones.\r"

This is a self-limited, nondeforming, seronegative arthritis that waxes and wanes with bowel flares. It characteristically involves knees and ankles. Persistent erosive monoarthritis is described. Second, spondylitis clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from idiopathic ankylosing spondylitis occurs in 3-6% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. HLA-B27 positivity occurs in 53-75% of cases, fewer than in idiopathic spondylitis. Third, a bilateral, symmetrical sacroiliitis is seen in 4-18% of patients. This may not progress to clinical spondylitis. The fourth category encompasses rheumatologic complications of inflammatory bowel disease. These include granulomas of bones and joints, granulomatous vasculitis, clubbing, periostitis, amyloidosis, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, septic arthritis, and complications of corticosteroid therapy.\r"

A review of the English-language literature revealed only 18 prior patients with hepatic amyloid associated with severe intrahepatic cholestasis. The histology of only one of these patients showed a similar distribution of amyloid deposits.\r"

Ultrasonography and computed tomograms showed a large abscess cavity in the right lobe of the liver which extended very close to the inferior vena cava. The lumen of the adjacent inferior vena cava was partially occluded by thrombus, which could be traced up into the cavity of the right atrium. The hepatic veins were normally patent. Sterile blood-stained pus was aspirated from the abscess. Antibodies against Entamoeba histolytica were present in high titer in the patient's serum. Although propagation of hepatocellular carcinoma into the inferior vena cava and even up into the right atrium is well recognized, inferior vena caval thrombosis extending up into the right atrium has not hitherto been reported as a complication of amebic hepatic abscess.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal hereditary disorder associated with a major reduction in serum A1AT levels. Clinically, A1AT deficiency is associated with emphysema in adults and, less commonly, liver disease in neonates. A1AT is a 52-kDa, 394-amino acid, single-chain glycoprotein normally present in serum at 150 to 350 mg/dl. The A1AT gene, composed of seven exons dispersed over 12 kb of chromosomal segment 14q31-32.3, is expressed in hepatocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. The A1AT protein, a member of the class of protease inhibitor proteins known as serpins (serine protease inhibitors), is a globular molecule composed of nine alpha-helices and three beta-pleated sheets. The major function of A1AT is to inhibit neutrophil elastase; A1AT does so through an active site centered around Met358 contained within an external stressed loop on the surface of the molecule. A1AT is a highly pleomorphic protein with greater than 75 variants determined at the protein and/or gene level. These variants can be categorized into four groups according to their serum A1AT level and function: normal, deficient, dysfunctional, and absent. There are two important salt bridges within the A1AT molecule (Glu342-Lys290; Glu263-Lys387); a mutation in the A1AT gene causing disruption of either salt bridge causes distinct molecular pathology resulting in reduced serum A1AT levels. Clinically relevant variants can be distinguished by a combination of isoelectric focusing of serum, restriction fragment length analysis of genomic DNA, oligonucleotide probes, and direct sequencing of the variant A1AT genes.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-1-protease inhibitor (A1PI) exists in over 30 biochemical variants (the Pi system), inherited as autosomal codominant alleles. Homozygotes of Pi type Z have only 10 to 20 percent of the normal serum A1PI concentration and have a high risk of developing pulmonary emphysema. A1PI is an inactivator of polymorph lysosomal elastase, the unopposed action of which may damage the lung. Cigarette smoking is an important additional risk factor. Neonatal hepatitis occurs in 10 to 20 percent of Pi type Z persons, and cirrhosis develops in a number of them in later childhood or in adult life. In heterozygotes of Pi type MZ, pulmonary or hepatic disease may also develop, though they are at lesser risk than type Z homozygotes. Specific A1PI replacement therapy derived from human plasma is now available and has been administered to Pi type Z patients by weekly intravenous infusion without adverse effects. A controlled clinical trial would be desirable, though this would be attended by organizational and economic problems.\r"

However, they also may be involved in other processes, including the activation or inactivation of protein hormones and the inactivation of plasma proteinase inhibitors. Neutrophil elastase has been implicated in the development of pulmonary emphysema, although a function for cathepsin G has not yet been elucidated. Both enzymes are normally tightly controlled by plasma proteinase inhibitors. However, this proteinase-proteinase inhibitor balance can be perturbed in favor of free enzyme by several methods, with resulting tissue damage. The use of inhibitors from several sources should be helpful in augmenting natural levels so that homeostasis can be maintained.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by low serum levels of A1AT and a high risk for the development of emphysema. A1AT is the principal inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, such that a deficiency of A1AT results in insufficient anti-elastase protection in the lower respiratory tract, thus allowing neutrophil elastase to destroy alveolar structures. The goal of A1AT augmentation therapy in A1AT deficiency is to raise lung A1AT levels and anti-neutrophil elastase capacity to levels that will provide adequate protection against neutrophil elastase, thereby preventing the lung from further elastase-mediated degradation. Studies with intravenous administration of human A1AT (60 mg/kg at weekly intervals) demonstrate that serum A1AT levels increased from an average 33 +/- 8 mg/dl pre-infusion to a steady-state trough level of 117 +/- 4 mg/dl, well above the projected threshold protective serum level of A1AT. The infused A1AT diffused into the lung and significantly augmented the epithelial lining fluid A1AT levels, rising from an average 0.44 +/- 0.16 microM (pre-infusion) to 2.62 +/- 1.29 microM at the nadir level just prior to the next infusion. Of critical importance is the fact that the A1AT that diffused into the lung was active as an inhibitor or neutrophil elastase, resulting in significant augmentation of epithelial lining fluid anti-neutrophil elastase capacity and normalization of the lung anti-elastase protection. In the over 800 weekly infusions administered, no significant adverse reactions have occurred. These findings demonstrate that long-term augmentation therapy with weekly infusions of A1AT is a rational, safe, and biochemically effective therapy for A1AT deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "In a six-month multicenter feasibility and safety study, 20 patients, who all had a congenital deficiency of alpha-1-protease inhibitor (A1PI) of the PiZ phenotype accompanied by a chronic obstructive lung disease, were treated with human-plasma-derived A1PI. A weekly dose of 60 mg/kg, administered intravenously, was shown to be sufficient to maintain patient serum levels above the threshold limit of 35 percent, the serum level of healthy persons of the MZ phenotype. This is supposed to be the minimal effective level for protection against the elastolytic attack of the lung and, therefore, satisfies one of the most important criteria of feasibility of long-term replacement therapy. The global concentration in serum or bronchiolar lavage fluid A1PI including active and inactivated A1PI was measured immunologically by rate nephelometry and radial immunodiffusion. The functional activity of A1PI, expressed as free inhibitor activity against trypsin and leukocyte elastase, confirmed that the infused A1PI remained mostly in its active form in the circulation. Reported adverse reactions were moderate and did not require alteration to the schedule of the infusions and/or the dose and rate of administration. Antibodies to A1PI as measured by the Ouchterlony method did not develop. Laboratory and physical signs of possible hepatitis virus contamination were not observed. The long-term replacement therapy, therefore, appears to be safe.\r"

A dichotomy exists in the use of diagnostic ultrasound examination in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. The dichotomy is a serious defect in our specialty that needs urgent addressing. The institutional problem can be partially resolved by furnishing the sonographer with the referred patient's history and physical findings. The problem of the ultrasound machine in the office of a private physician is much more complex. It may require government intervention and strict licensing measures for resolution.\r"
