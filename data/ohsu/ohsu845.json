Ethanol was infused intravenously in a dose of 0.6 g/kg of body weight over 45 to 60 min and serial blood samples obtained for 5 hr. The mean rate of ethanol elimination was higher in seven women, not different in one, and lower in one compared with their male siblings. The mean rate of ethanol elimination for all nine women was higher at 1.93 +/- 0.12 as compared with the value of 1.69 +/- 0.17 mmoles/kg body weight/hr in the men (p less than 0.05). Higher rates of ethanol metabolism in women as compared to men may be important in the increased susceptibility of women to liver injury caused by alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".U": "90102854\r", 
  ".W": "Several enzymes active in the presence of NAD with acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde have been purified from human brain and characterized. The enzymes have been identified as aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3), NAD-linked succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.24), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is extremely heterogeneous with some isozymes active with acetaldehyde, others inactive. The cytoplasmic enzyme, which is the classical glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is inactive with acetaldehyde as substrate; the isozymes that are active with short chain aliphatic aldehydes are localized in the mitochondrial fraction. Properties of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isozymes with respect to short chain aliphatic aldehydes and inhibition by disulfiram are described. Their Km values for acetaldehyde range from 300 to 2000 microM. All glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases that are active with acetaldehyde are easily inactivated by low concentrations of disulfiram. In all cases activity regain can be obtained with 2-mercaptoethanol; in the case of two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate isozymes (E8.5 and 9.0), activity can also be regained with cysteine and with glutathione; activity of E6.6 and E6.8 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases could not be regained with 33 microM cysteine or glutathione. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) were also inhibited by disulfiram; their activity could be regained with 2-mercaptoethanol but not with 33 microM cysteine or glutathione. Comparison of human brain succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shows that the activity with short chain aldehydes is not unique to aldehyde dehydrogenase; neither is sensitivity to disulfiram; activity with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde appears to be a unique property of aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3).\r"

Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of those antibodies at the time of first admission, and their clinical, biochemical, and histological findings were compared. In 38 seropositive patients, the total amount of ethanol consumption as well as serum activity of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, serum levels of total bilirubin, gamma-globulin, IgG, and IgA were all significantly higher than in 53 seronegative patients. In addition, the extent of fibrosis, alcoholic hyalin, cholestasis, and lymphocytic and polymorpholeukocytic infiltrations in the liver were all significantly greater in the seropositive patients. Histological changes were compared in the 16 patients who continued to drink alcohol and who received repeated liver biopsies. Seven out of eight patients who were seropositive at the time of the first liver biopsy showed histological deterioration, whereas one of the eight seronegative patients showed a slight progression. These results suggest that the presence of serum antibodies against alcohol-altered liver cell membrane delineates a group of alcoholic patients with severe, advanced liver disease characterized by a tendency to progress with continued alcohol ingestion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acetaldehyde in vitro on the lytic capacity of murine spleen cells have been evaluated in three systems: antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), natural killer (NK) activity, and alloimmune cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Acetaldehyde had a biphasic effect on ADCC. Concentrations less than 1 mM acetaldehyde potentiated ADCC. Concentrations greater than 1 mM produced a progressive decrease in lysis. The inhibitory effects were at the effector cell level and were partially irreversible. Preincubation experiments showed that inhibition of ADCC was both concentration and time-dependent. Preincubation of the spleen cells for short periods of time produced potentiated lysis by concentrations of acetaldehyde up to 10 mM. However, potentiation of lysis in preincubation and short term (4h) lytic assay experiments was more variable than longer term (18h) experiments in which the acetaldehyde was not removed by washing. NK activity and alloimmune CTL-mediated lysis were also inhibited by acetaldehyde. Concentrations of acetaldehyde up to 20 mM did not significantly decrease lymphocyte viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Acetaldehyde was lost from the reaction mixtures by first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.5/hr. Thus, the final concentrations were 64-99.99% lower than the starting amounts.\r"

Ethanol-exposed offspring weighed significantly less than control offspring from postnatal Day 7 through postnatal Day 28. Ethanol-exposed offspring also showed significant delays in reflex suspension (time an animal maintained its grip on a crossbar) and continuous corridor (number of turns in 5 min). The thickness of the cerebral cortex of ethanol-exposed offspring was significantly different from ad libitum and pairfed control offspring on postnatal Day 1. However, only Layer V and total cortical thickness were affected in ethanol-exposed offspring on postnatal Day 28. The results of this study indicate that ethanol exposure during a critical period of development causes alterations in central nervous system development and developmental delays.\r"

A system of inpatient chart audit classification was developed to assess direct evidence of patient alcoholism. In addition, the reported prevalence of alcoholism as a discharge diagnosis was determined. An assessment of the degree of alcoholism was used to classify patients into severity levels. A determination was made of the relationship of hospital chart data classification level to other medical problems or treatments directly addressed by the physician(s) that would indicate that the alcohol abuse, if present, was considered. A retrospective chart audit was conducted for 809 consecutive adult admissions to a 350-bed urban university teaching hospital using a specific classification scheme for determining evidence of alcoholism. This technique revealed a reported prevalence of alcoholism in 4.3% of all nonobstetric admissions to this university hospital. However, a chart review technique using specific criteria for the diagnosis of probable alcoholism raised the estimated prevalence to 15.9%. When the chart contained a primary diagnosis of alcoholism, physicians' responses reflected treatment plans that addressed acute management of alcohol related medical complications but often did not document efforts to assist the patient with the underlying alcoholism/substance abuse.\r"

Most of the available data regarding the prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal sites of bleeding in cirrhotic patients have been obtained in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis evaluated in the course of an acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode. Few data exist, however, as to the prevalence of either potential bleeding sites or of normal endoscopic findings in hemodynamically stable individuals with cirrhosis of any etiology. Five hundred ten cirrhotic subjects, who were evaluated for possible liver transplantation (OLTx) between January 1985 and June 1987, were included in this study. Seventy-five had alcoholic cirrhosis and 435 had nonalcoholic cirrhosis of various etiologies. Of these 510 patients, 412 underwent combined upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and 98 underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy alone. Gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer disease were found significantly (each at least p less than 0.025) more often in patients with alcoholic liver disease than in those with nonalcoholic liver disease. The prevalence of the various lower gastrointestinal lesions in both groups was similar. Of particular interest is the fact that in alcoholic cirrhotics, the prevalence of gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer disease was unrelated to the degree of portal hypertension, whereas in the nonalcoholic cirrhotics the prevalence of gastritis and duodenal ulcer disease but not gastric ulcer disease was associated significantly with the degree of portal hypertension as assessed by the presence or absence of large esophageal varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Male Swiss-Webster mice that consumed liquid alcohol diets containing 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, or 0% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) for 7 weeks were bred to untreated females that were not exposed to alcohol diets. Males receiving the 20-0% EDC diets were pair-fed to those consuming the 25% EDC diet. At approximately 60 days of age, male offspring were challenged with 10(8) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa onto the scarified cornea of one eye. The ocular response was then evaluated macroscopically for 4 weeks. Male offspring sired by alcohol-consuming fathers exhibited more severe ocular infection at 24 hr postinfection compared with mice sired by control fathers and, after 8 days postinfection, more corneas of the 25% EDC-sired progeny perforated than did the other groups. At 30 days after infection, serum immunoglobulin titers (IgM, IgG, IgA) specific to P. aeruginosa were determined by ELISA. Although the majority of the mice were unable to restore corneal clarity within 30 days postinfection, a strong serum IgG response was detected in pooled sera from those animals tested. Offspring were reinfected in the contralateral control eye at 30 days postprimary infection. Most control animals were able to restore corneal clarity in the contralateral control eye within 30 days postinfection, but less than a third of the alcohol-sired offspring did so. Again, the pooled sera that was tested indicated a strong humoral response, despite differences in corneal clarity. These studies indicate an increased susceptibility to infection and an impairment in restoration of corneal clarity in offspring sired by alcohol-consuming males, which does not appear to be mediated by serum antibody mechanisms.\r"

The cognitive performance tasks employed--group embedded figures, revised Beta mazes, mirror tracing, and symbol-digit paired associate learning--had all been previously shown to present difficulties to male alcoholics. No evidence was obtained of a relationship between heavy drinking or familial risk and cognitive functioning, nor a meaningful interaction of these two independent variables. Little evidence was revealed for the \"hangover hypothesis\" as evidenced by a relationship between drinking behavior within the past week and cognitive performance. The findings are discussed in the context of previous findings in these areas and the general difficulties of interpretation posed in nonexperimental research based on subject variables.\r"

Blood was obtained from male nonalcoholics and chronic alcoholics with minimal liver damage and normal hematology. Plasma, erythrocyte, and urinary B6 compounds were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, and pyridoxal phosphate was also measured enzymatically. Erythrocyte pyridoxine kinase and pyridoxine phosphate oxidase and erythrocyte and plasma pyridoxine phosphate phosphatases were assayed. Plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentration was significantly lower in the alcoholics (31.3 +/- 3.6 nmol/liter) than in the nonalcoholics (58.7 +/- 7.5 nmol/liter). The concentrations of the other B6 compounds in plasma, erythrocytes, and urine were not different in the two groups. Plasma alkaline pyridoxine phosphate phosphatase activity was significantly higher in the alcoholics (4.05 +/- 0.36 nmol/(h.mg] than in the nonalcoholics (3.01 +/- 0.18 nmol/(h.mg]. The activities of erythrocyte kinase, oxidase, and phosphatases were not significantly different in the two groups. The relationship of plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentration to its metabolites and the activities of the enzymes involved in its metabolism was determined. Plasma pyridoxine phosphate phosphatase activity assayed at pH 9.0 or 7.4 correlated negatively with plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentration. The low pyridoxal phosphate concentration observed in the plasma of the alcoholic subjects may in part be related to increased plasma phosphatase activity.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of 229 male patients and 198 female patients who met lifetime DSM-III criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence was carried out in Toronto, Canada. The patients were evaluated with the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule and other substance abuse rating scales. The prevalence of individual alcohol and drug symptoms, the patterns of abuse, and the prevalence of drug disorders were compared in the two sexes. The study patients were younger than previous treatment samples and were more likely to have other drug disorders. While the overall prevalence of drug disorders was similar in male and female alcoholics, women were more likely to abuse sedatives and minor tranquilizers while men were more prone to the abuse of cannabis and tobacco. Men continue to be more likely to have social and occupational problems resulting from alcohol abuse, to start abusing alcohol earlier in their lives, to have been abusing for longer, and to report higher quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. With one or two exceptions, the sexes do not differ on other indicators of pathologic use, withdrawal or tolerance, medical sequelae or treatment history. While men have significantly more alcohol problems than women, as measured by the DIS and the MAST, these differences disappear when length of alcohol abuse history, antisocial personality disorder and employment status are controlled for. Similarly, when these variables are controlled for, women exhibit more symptoms of alcohol dependence as measured by the ADS. Women alcoholics come into treatment earlier in their alcoholic careers.\r"

Protein synthesis was evaluated both in a cell-free system and in hepatocytes after (35S)methionine and (3H)leucine incorporation, respectively. Glycosylation was assessed using (3H)mannose and (3H)galactose as precursors. Protein synthesis was significantly decreased in treated hepatocytes. In control hepatocytes, quantitative electron microscope autoradiography showed that both (3H)leucine and (3H)mannose incorporation occur first in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). Later the silver grains appeared over the Golgi apparatus, and, finally there was a transport towards the cell periphery. After pulse, silver grains corresponding to (3H)galactose incorporation appeared over the Golgi apparatus. The label then moved to the hepatocyte periphery. Alcohol treated hepatocytes showed a retention of grains over the Golgi apparatus with a diminution in the label at the cell periphery. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to alcohol induces a decrease in the synthesis of proteins in the hepatocyte as well as an alteration in the process of glycosylation and/or transport of secretory proteins.\r"

Ethanol at concentrations of 20 to 100 mM inhibited PAF activation of human platelets. Ethanol inhibited prominently the second or arachidonic acid metabolite dependent wave of platelet aggregation, which occurs with human platelets in citrated plasma. It also inhibited serotonin release and thromboxane A2 formation associated with this secondary phase of aggregation. Ethanol did not readily inhibit the primary wave of PAF-induced aggregation. The incorporation of PAF into platelets or metabolism of PAF was not influenced by up to 100 mM ethanol. Since ethanol inhibited only the secondary response, a direct interaction between PAF, ethanol, and a platelet PAF receptor is unlikely. The effect of ethanol on PAF-induced platelet aggregation shows a selectivity similar to that demonstrated by other investigators for epinephrine and adenosine diphosphate.\r"

Furthermore, and rather unexpectedly, we also found that withdrawal from alcohol led to a decrease of the relative number of granule cells in the fascia dentata. Thus, it seemed worthwhile to quantify, using a semiautomatic measuring system, the dendritic arborizations of hippocampal granule cells of rats alcohol-fed for 12 months followed by 6 months of abstinence and compare the results with age-matched control and alcohol-fed groups. The results indicate smaller dendritic trees in the abstinent group when compared with the higher values of the dendritic parameters found in alcohol-fed rats.\r"

A stable mean plateau of 263 +/- 71 SD with a range of 160-400 nmoles/g hemoglobin WBAA was found in the group consuming ethanol compared with 122 +/- 17 SD and a range of 88-150 nmoles/g hemoglobin for controls (p less than 0.001). When ethanol was discontinued, levels of WBAA declined and became similar to those of controls by 9 days following cessation of ethanol. The quantitative difference between ethanol-consuming and control animals and also the rapid rise of whole blood-associated acetaldehyde and the relatively slow decline following cessation of ethanol intake indicate that such a test might be a useful monitor of drinking behavior.\r"

Methacholine responsiveness was analyzed using dose-response slope to describe each subject's responsiveness. Current smokers were observed to have significantly greater total serum IgE concentration ([IgE]), blood total leukocyte count, and blood eosinophil count than nonsmokers. Current smokers with at least one positive skin test reaction to common aeroallergens displayed significantly greater methacholine dose-response slope than smokers with negative skin test results (p less than 0.01). Among nonsmokers, skin test positivity was associated with slightly but not significantly greater methacholine responsiveness. Among subjects with negative skin test results, smoking was not associated with greater methacholine responsiveness. Blood eosinophil count and serum total [IgE] displayed weak but statistically significant direct relationships to methacholine dose-response slope (p less than 0.01), and these relationships were not significantly modified by smoking status. In a multivariate model, the cigarette smoking/skin test positivity interaction, total serum [IgE], and blood eosinophil count displayed significant, independent relationships to methacholine dose-response slope, although only a small portion of the variance of dose-response slope was accounted for by these covariates. These data suggest that smoking and atopy may act synergistically to increase the degree of nonspecific airway responsiveness displayed by middle-aged and elderly individuals. Allergic airway inflammation, as reflected by total serum [IgE] and blood eosinophil count, may also influence nonspecific airway responsiveness in this age group.\r"

In this study, we tested whether the elastase-induced hamster model of emphysema and bronchial secretory cell metaplasia shows a similar hyperreactivity. Four weeks after intratracheal administration of 0.2 mg/100 g body weight porcine pancreatic elastase, the animals were anesthetized and ventilated with a constant tidal volume of 5 ml/kg. Changes in airway pressure (Paw) were monitored before and after intravenous challenge with 0.7 mg/kg acetylcholine (ACh). There was a significant decrease in baseline Paw from 5.7 +/- 0.6 cm H2O in control animals (n = 6) to 4.0 +/- 0.6 cm H2O in emphysematous animals (n = 6). The peak Paw response to the intravenous challenge, normalized to the baseline Paw, was 2.9 +/- 0.4 in control animals, but it was significantly increased in the emphysematous animals to 4.4 +/- 1.1. Trachea, bronchi, and parenchyma from these lungs were challenged with cumulative dose of ACh and KCl. Sensitivity of the trachea and bronchi to ACh challenge, assessed as the log ED50, did not show differences between the two groups. However, the emphysematous parenchyma showed greater sensitivity to ACh compared with the control parenchyma. Trachea and bronchi from emphysematous animals showed significantly decreased maximal contractility to challenge with both ACh and KCl. In contrast, the emphysematous parenchyma showed significantly greater maximal contractility. These findings were independent of the baseline passive tension. This increased responsiveness may relate to increased passive distensibility of the emphysematous parenchyma.\r"

Lung reactivity to an intravenous bolus of 0.7 mg/kg acetylcholine (ACh) was measured as the change in peak airway pressure of anesthetized ventilated animals. In the normal hamsters, lung reactivity was 57% higher during the day (8 A.M., 12 P.M., and 4 P.M.) than during the night (p = 0.01). This increased reactivity was not associated with any changes in baseline pressures. The lung reactivity was correlated to body activity as measured on an electronic activity monitor over seven consecutive days. The hamster, being a nocturnal forager, gradually increased activity at about 6 P.M. and maintained intermittent activity until about 6 A.M. Sleep occurred between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., and this was when the lung reactivity was greatest. In the myopathic hamsters, although the magnitude of the response to ACh was about 40% lower than that in normal animals, the lung reactivity during the daytime was still about 46% greater than that during the night (p = 0.007). The body activity records from the myopathic animals showed that these animals do not have a normal sleep pattern during the daytime; sleep is not continuous, showing intermittent periods of physical activity. Our results in the normal animals are consistent with observations in man, which show greater problems with airway obstruction and asthmatic attacks during the night.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While the relative efficacies of the two theophylline preparations have been examined in a number of studies, previous efforts have not assessed the impact of compliance on therapeutic effectiveness. When a blood theophylline level of 10 to 20 micrograms is taken to constitute the therapeutic range, twice-daily has been shown to yield 15% greater efficacy than once-daily dosing. However, results of the present investigation suggest that a drop in compliance greater than 4 to 14%, associated with once- versus twice-daily dosing, would be sufficient to obliterate the apparent advantage of the twice-daily preparation. The existing empirical evidence suggests that selecting twice-daily over once-daily dosing will incur a drop in compliance that is substantially greater than 14%. Consequently, when the impact of compliance is incorporated into a decision analysis, once-daily dosing is favored over twice-daily dosing for most patients. The decision will favor twice-daily theophylline only in the unusual case in which continuity of contact with a given patient provides strong evidence that he/she is more than 80% likely to comply with the twice-daily regimen. Decision analyses applied to this topic would benefit greatly from better studies of compliance in asthmatic patients and more careful correlations of symptoms with varying medication usage.\r"

All five patients had symptoms consistent with a sleep apnea syndrome. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) was administered at 8 to 12.5 cm H2O to all patients during sleep. The number of apneas fell from (mean +/- SE) 60 +/- 12/h of sleep on the control night to 9 +/- 7/h of sleep (p less than 0.01) on the NCPAP night, whereas mean nocturnal SaO2 rose from 88 +/- 2% on the control night to 92 +/- 2% (p less than 0.025) while on NCPAP. This was associated with resolution of symptoms of sleep apnea. In addition, resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured by radionuclide angiography (RNA) rose from 31 +/- 8% while off NCPAP to 38 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) while on NCPAP. Furthermore, all five patients experienced marked improvement in symptoms of heart failure from functional classes III and IV (New York Heart Association Classification) prior to NCPAP therapy to class II after NCPAP therapy was instituted. We conclude that, in certain patients, CSR during sleep associated with chronic CHF constitutes a sleep apnea syndrome, which can be alleviated by NCPAP. In addition, NCPAP therapy may lead to a reduction in cardiac dyspnea and improvement in left ventricular function.\r"

This study was performed to determine possible effects of the corticosteroid methyl prednisolone acetate (MPA) on PI-1 infection in hamsters. Hamsters serologically negative for PI-1 were exposed to virus alone or were exposed to virus the day after pretreatment with a single subcutaneous injection of MPA. Serum antibodies to PI-1 were present in virus-only exposed hamsters by Day 8 and increased up to Day 20. PI-1 was recovered from lungs of virus-only exposed hamsters on Day 2 to 8. Virus antigen was detected by immunocytochemistry on Days 2 to 10 in lungs of virus-only exposed hamsters. Virus-associated lesions in these hamsters began as acute bronchiolar epithelium degeneration and necrosis on Day 4 and were foci of fibrosis by Days 12 to 20. Hamsters exposed to virus after MPA treatment developed no antibodies to virus, had no virus detectable by plaque assays or immunocytochemistry, and had no pulmonary lesions. Hamsters treated with MPA had decreased total lymphocyte counts up to Day 20 after treatment. Treatment of hamsters with MPA one day prior to PI-1 virus exposure is associated with no detectable evidence of viral infection. Humoral and cellular immunity mediated by MPA-sensitive lymphocytes may mediate some of the manifestations of PI-1 pulmonary disease.\r"

On Day 2 we repeated methacholine challenge after premedication with aerosolized atropine, and we defined the response to atropine as dose ratio-1 (DR-1) where DR = PD35 after atropine/PD35 without atropine. On Day 3 we imaged intrapulmonary aerosol deposition by mixing 99mtechnetium with methacholine aerosol and scanning the thorax with a gamma camera during the development of bronchoconstriction. Total pulmonary aerosol deposition varied considerably between individuals (1.2 to 23.6% of nebulized dose) but there was no difference between normal and asthmatic subjects, and no correlation between deposition and baseline SGaw or PD35; there was a significant positive correlation between deposition and DR-1. Deposition of aerosol in central lung zones was inversely related to SGaw and correlated positively with DR-1; there was no significant relationship with PD35. Total intrapulmonary aerosol deposition and its pattern partially determine bronchial responsiveness to atropine, but we have not demonstrated any significant effect on responsiveness to methacholine.\r"

We have studied the light and electron microscopic structure of lobar bronchial biopsies taken at fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 11 atopic asthmatics, four of whom were symptomatic and seven of whom were asymptomatic. The former and three of the latter had bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (PC20 less than 4 mg/ml). Quantitative comparisons were made with biopsies from ten control subjects with normal airway reactivity; five had hay fever and five were nonatopic healthy volunteers. Complete absence of surface epithelium was found in three cases of symptomatic asthma, and stratified squamous epithelium was present in the fourth. A biopsy from one of the healthy control subjects had also lost its surface epithelium. The degree of epithelial loss in all subjects correlated with the degree of airway reactivity (rs = 0.67, p less than 0.001). The reticular lamina of the epithelial basement membrane showed a trend toward thickening in the seven hyperreactive asthmatics (p less than 0.001: median test). There was a tendency to high numbers of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, but not in the submucosa, of asthmatics, but the differences between groups did not achieve statistical significance. There were significant alterations (px2 less than 0.001) in the proportions of each type of inflammatory cell found in the lamina propria and submucosa of symptomatic asthmatics: an increase of irregularly shaped lymphocytes contributed most to the observed alteration. Where surface epithelium was present, intraepithelial lymphocytes formed the major proportion of intraepithelial \"migratory\" cells: 64% in normal control subjects, 78% in subjects with hay fever, and 87% in asymptomatic asthmatics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bronchial asthma is characterized pathologically by airway narrowing, inflammation, edema, and obstruction by mucus. Bronchial asthma is defined as increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree, which is manifested clinically as reversible expiratory airflow obstruction. The classic symptoms of bronchial asthma are cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Cardiac asthma produces the same symptoms, but the pathophysiology producing these symptoms is not well described. We describe two patients with cardiac asthma who failed to demonstrate airway hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific bronchoprovocation testing and we postulate that these patients' symptoms were produced exclusively by left ventricular failure.\r"

Among the bioactive products identified within the secretory granules of these cells are potent mitogens and bronchoactive and vasoactive agents. The secretory status of these cells, which are in greatest number in the fetus and newborn, is modulated by neural reflexes and by changes in airway gas composition. The aggregate data suggest roles for PNEC in airway \"chemoception\" and/or regulation of airway epithelial differentiation. Marked increases in PNEC are observed in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, where airway and alveolar fibrosis, epithelial metaplasia, and airway and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy contribute to marked pathophysiologic changes in lung function. Considering the biologic effects of PNEC secretory products, particularly gastrin-releasing peptide on airway epithelial cell and fibroblast proliferation, we propose that an increase in PNEC secretory products in the regenerating airway epithelium may contribute to the development of the pathologic alterations in lung structure seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this proposed scheme, secretion of abnormally large amounts of bronchoactive and vasoactive agents from PNEC (e.g., serotonin, gastrin-releasing peptide) in response to airway hypoxia and hypercapnia may be partially responsible in the genesis of reactive airway disease and pulmonary hypertension seen in this disease.\r"

All temporal-artery biopsies done at Carraway Methodist Medical Center between January 1980 and January 1985 were reviewed. Seventy-three biopsies were performed on 70 patients and eight (11.4%) were found to have temporal arteritis histologically. One patient was judged to have temporal arteritis clinically, despite a negative biopsy of short length. Six of eight patients with positive biopsies were female, with an average age of 71.7 years. The most common signs and symptoms of those patients with positive biopsies were temporal headache (8/8), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (7/8), temporal tenderness (5/8), jaw claudication (3/8), and visual changes (3/8). All biopsies were done under local anesthesia and there were no complications. With increasing awareness of the segmental nature of the disease, the length of biopsy specimens (formalin treated) increased from an average of 0.4 cm in 1980 to 2.4 cm in 1984. During this time, the positive rate increased from 0 per cent (0/9) to 17 per cent (4/24). A generous biopsy of approximately 5 cm in length of fresh vessel is recommended to confirm the suspected diagnosis of temporal arteritis.\r"

As a result of this, 547 patients had open surgical biopsy, 207 carcinomas were detected in 207 patients, 183 carcinomas (80% of total malignancies) were clinically occult and detected only with breast imaging. Since 207 malignancies were found out of 547 areas examined, our rate was 1 carcinoma in every 2.6 biopsies. One hundred seventy-nine malignant lesions had preoperative needle localization and specimen radiography. Eighty-seven (47%) clinically occult carcinomas were identified because of microcalcifications by mammography alone. Two hundred twenty-six (98%) of the carcinomas were called malignant or suspicious for malignancy with only three (2.4%) false negatives. Twenty-two (10%) patients had axillary lymph-node metastasis. While recent large series report a 15 to 30 per cent rate of carcinoma for nonpalpable, mammographically detected breast biopsy specimens, it is our experience at MSMC with the use of physical exam and mammography, complemented by ultrasound when indicated, that rates of detection of carcinoma are more significantly improved than what the recent literature suggests; therefore, our approach to achieve this better detection will be discussed.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Clinical study unit of tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: All patients entering the interleukin-2 +/- LAK cancer immunotherapy protocol during a 28-month period. Control groups were patients in a surgical intensive care unit, patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, and patients with solid tumors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of 107 (19%) interleukin-2-treated patients developed sepsis; in 12 of these patients, sepsis was intravenous catheter-associated. The bacteremia rate among patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, in the surgical intensive care unit, or having solid tumors was 2.8%, 4.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in 13 courses; Staphylococcus epidermidis, in 5; and Escherichia coli, in 2. Two patients died; three developed suppurative thrombophlebitis; one developed septic arthritis; one, septic arterial aneurysm; and one, peritonitis with probable meningitis. Colonization with S. aureus increased the risk of S. aureus bacteremia 6.3-fold (95% CI, 2.8 to 14.5; P less than 0.001); skin desquamation at the catheter site increased the relative risk 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1; P = 0.031). Both colonization with S. aureus and skin desquamation increased the relative risk of S. aureus bacteremia 14.5-fold (95% CI, 4.1 to 50.9; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal bacteremia is more frequent in patients receiving interleukin-2 therapy and is associated with substantial morbidity and toxic skin reactions.\r"

Beta-blocking ophthalmic agents are generally safe, but can be absorbed systemically to induce bronchospasm, worsen heart block, decompensate congestive heart failure, or create central nervous system effects in some patients. Reports of adverse systemic effects from miotics, such as pilocarpine, are rare, although cardiovascular decompensation has been seen in patients with acute angle closure who were given excessive doses before surgery. Topical sympathomimetic agents such as epinephrine may increase ventricular extrasystoles and have, on occasion, caused severe hypertensive reactions. Nearly 50% of patients taking carbonic anhydrase inhibitors must discontinue their use because of various adverse constitutional and central nervous system symptoms. Although these drugs are not usually part of internal medicine regimens, they can produce adverse effects that mimic primary disease in nonocular organ systems.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published since 1983 identified through a computerized search of MEDLINE and extensive hand searching of bibliographies in identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Twenty-nine studies done in vitro or in animals and 21 studies in humans assessing biliary lithotripsy. DATA EXTRACTION: Based on an understanding of experimental determinants of fragmentation, we assess and explain the differences in the results from the clinical studies. The conclusions concerning overall clinical efficacy and safety are emphasized. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Extracorporeal shock waves will safely fragment the gallstones of 80% to 100% of selected patients. However, the rate of satisfactory fragmentation (defined as the persistence of fragments only 3 to 5 mm in diameter or less) varies widely among the studies (22% to 78%); this discrepancy depends partly on differing characteristics of stone populations. For patients presenting with solitary stones of 20 mm in diameter or less, 90% will be stone-free within 6 to 9 months after lithotripsy; moreover, the success of lithotripsy determines the rapidity and extent of fragment dissolution. Bile-duct-stone lithotripsy is reserved for patients in whom endoscopic stone extraction and intracorporeal lithotripsy, with or without direct contact dissolution, have failed. Lithotripsy achieves ductal clearance in 55% to 85% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal lithotripsy is safe and effective in selected patients, and has a definite role to play in managing patients with biliary stone disease. Its role in the coming years will depend on technical improvements in the generators, a tailored approach to complementary dissolution or extraction, and effective prophylactic therapy for preventing gallstone recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 6-month change in cardiovascular (coronary heart disease) risk as a function of diet and drug therapy for mild hypertension. DESIGN: Collaborative randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of alternative regimens in treating mild hypertension. SETTING: Three university-based tertiary care centers-the Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management (TAIM). PATIENTS: Six hundred and ninety-two men and women ages 21 to 65 years with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg and weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients stratified by clinical center and race were randomized into diet (usual, low sodium-high potassium, weight loss) and drug (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol) groups resulting in nine diet plus drug combinations. The cardiovascular risk at 6-month follow-up was estimated relative to baseline in 692 participants using the Framingham Study model. Due to the blood pressure reduction, cardiovascular risk declined from baseline for all treatment groups (except the usual diet plus chlorthalidone group because of increased cholesterol levels). The relative cardiovascular risk at 6 months compared to baseline ranged from 0.83 in the weight loss plus atenolol subgroup to 1.03 in the usual diet plus chlorthalidone subgroup. The active drug plus weight loss groups showed the lowest relative cardiovascular risk at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypertension was generally reduced to desirable levels within 6 months by monotherapy. Evaluating blood pressure changes together with the risk factors indicated a differential effect on overall cardiovascular risk depending on the diet and drug used. Dietary therapy, particularly weight reduction, was important adjunctive treatment in reducing overall cardiovascular risk.\r"

In medium MCDB 153 containing epidermal growth factor, insulin, bovine pituitary extract, and 0.1 or 2.0 mmol/L Ca++, squamous mucosal cells double every 24 hours. These cells then can be induced to arrest their proliferation reversibly by treatment with transforming growth factor-beta or ethionine, and they can irreversibly growth-arrest during senescence or when cultured in growth factor-deficient medium containing 2 mmol/L Ca++. The latter medium also induces differentiation, as does culture of cells in serum-containing medium. Serum-containing medium furthermore promotes extensive cell stratification and the formation of multilayered squamous mucosal tissue specimens that can be removed intact by Dispase treatment. These specimens represent potential autogenous mucosal grafts that can be used in patients who require reconstructive surgery of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Normal human squamous mucosal cells therefore closely resemble keratinocytes derived from the epidermis in the mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation. This model cell system should facilitate future studies on upper aerodigestive tract squamous mucosal cell physiology and pathophysiology.\r"

Sixty-six patients with tinnitus presumed to be of cochlear origin were given either a placebo or 75 mg of AOAA four times a day for 1 week. Response was evaluated by both audiometric measurement of tinnitus loudness and subjective rating by patients of change or no change in tinnitus severity. Because loudness measurements and self-rating have not been shown to be independent, and since the aim of clinical treatment of tinnitus is the alleviation of subjective distress, greater weight was given to the patient's self-rating. A total of 21% of all patients reported a subjective decrease in tinnitus severity, usually within 3 to 4 days after the start of AOAA use. Patients with tinnitus caused by presbycusis or Meniere's disease were the most likely to respond to AOAA treatment with a reduction in tinnitus severity, whereas those with drug-induced tinnitus were the least likely to respond. Nausea and dysequilibrium were the most common side effects of AOAA use. Of the 21% of patients who responded to AOAA, 71% developed some type of side effect. Amino-oxyacetic acid produces a reduction in the severity of tinnitus in about 20% of patients; however, the incidence of side effects makes the drug unacceptable for clinical use.\r"

As part of a larger multicentre trial, 502 low birthweight infants were assigned randomly, for a median of 30 days, to receive a preterm formula or unfortified donor breast milk as sole diets or as supplements to their mothers' expressed milk. Surviving infants were assessed at nine months after their expected date of delivery without knowledge of their feeding regimen. The mean developmental quotient was 0.25 standard deviations lower in those fed donor breast milk rather than preterm formula. In infants fed their mother's expressed milk, however, the disadvantage of receiving banked milk compared with preterm formula as a supplement, was greater when the supplement was over half the total intake, and approached five points, representing 0.5 standard deviations for developmental quotient. Infants fed donor breast milk were at particular disadvantage following fetal growth retardation, with developmental quotients 5.3 points lower. We suggest that the diet used for low birthweight babies over a brief, but perhaps critical, postnatal period has developmental consequences that persist into infancy; infants who are small for gestational age are especially vulnerable to suboptimal postnatal nutrition.\r"

From removal of tumor-bearing, ill-defined portions of the liver, which is always threatened by the inability to control bleeding, surgery of the liver has progressed to hemostatically controlled dissection of anatomically defined portions of the organ. Accompanying the series of technical refinements that have markedly reduced the mortality and morbidity rates associated with the procedure, there has been an expansion of the indications for hepatic resection.\r"

  ".W": "Crack, the free-base form of cocaine, was introduced as an illicit street drug in 1986. Since then, we have noted a significant increase in acute gastroduodenal perforations. Between 1982 and 1986, we treated 11 patients with such perforations. This represents a constant occurrence rate of 6% of hospital admissions for peptic ulcer disease. Since 1986 we have treated 16 patients with gastroduodenal perforation, which yields an occurrence rate of 16%. Nine of the 16 patients had a close temporal relationship between the use of crack and the onset of their perforation. This group was younger and disproportionately comprised of male patients. These findings led us to believe that there may be a pathogenic relationship between the use of crack and acute gastroduodenal perforation, and the clinician should be aware of the various potential complications of this new drug. This relationship also raises questions about the exact pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

  ".U": "90103619\r", 
  ".W": "In a detailed review of cystic hepatobiliary neoplasms, we identified a subset of 50 cases in which tumors were characterized by the presence of a mesenchymal cell layer interposed between an inner epithelial lining and an outer connective tissue layer. We have recently seen three such patients, making a total of 53 patients reported in the English literature. All of the patients were female, 44 of whom, with an average age of 41 years, had benign tumors. The average age of the remaining nine patients was 57 years and these patients had malignant tumors. In seven patients, the malignancy arose from the epithelial layer, but in two patients sarcomatous changes were identified in the mesenchymal tissues. The older age of the patients with malignant tumors with adequate serial biopsies in two cases supported the thesis that malignant transformation may occur in the benign tumors. Moreover the location of the tumor in one of our patients in whom the resected tumor was associated with anomalous right hepatic ducts and portal veins supported the theory that these tumors develop embryologically from nests of primitive hepatobiliary endodermal and mesodermal cells. Although surgical treatment was performed in all patients, 25% of the patients with benign hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma (CMS), and 33% of the patients with malignant CMS had tumor recurrence after primary resection. Ninety per cent of these patients had an incomplete resection at the time of their initial operations. Forty-four per cent of the patients with malignant CMS died after a mean follow-up of 17 months. We conclude that CMS (Edmonson's tumor) occurs uniquely in young female patients, develops from nests of primitive embryonal cells, has the potential for malignant transformation, and should be completely resected at primary operation to avoid recurrence.\r"

The other 62 patients left the hospital and were closely followed for 25 to 78 months. Recurrence of carcinoma became obvious in 41 (66%) of 62 patients. The clinical and pathologic features of these 41 patients were not significantly different from those of the other patients. Recurrent tumors were found in the residual liver in 38 patients (93%), in the bone in 2 (5%), and in the lung in 1 (2%). Recurrence was diagnosed within 1 year, between 1 and 2 years, and more than 2 years after the operation in 22 (56%), 10 (26%), and 7 (18%) patients, respectively. It was difficult to determine the exact time of recurrence in two patients. There was a significant negative correlation between the size of primary tumor and time until recurrence; the larger the primary tumor, the shorter the time until recurrence. Among the 29 patients who underwent local excisions for their primary tumors, 19 recurrences were observed. Eighteen were found in the residual liver, in the same segment as the primary tumor, or in one near it. Larger hepatic resection for primary tumors is thus advocated to prevent recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Ibuprofen is a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor known to reduce the production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Prostacyclin and thromboxane are well-studied metabolites that play a prominent role in inflammation. Many of the effects of ibuprofen can be linked to its anti-inflammatory properties. Beneficial results from ibuprofen therapy have been documented, and more widespread use of the drug seems indicated. Conditions ranging from immunologic response to trauma and sepsis to postburn lung dysfunction to wound edema are improved by the use of ibuprofen. The fact that ibuprofen is effective in the various conditions detailed above, while other steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs are effective only in selective instances, increases the value of ibuprofen. Other properties of the drug, aside from its anti-inflammatory effects, are not as well studied and not as well known. Their importance, however, should not be overlooked. Superoxide radical tissue injury may be very important in acute injury and this phenomenon needs further study. In several studies ibuprofen has been shown to antagonize this type of injury. Similarly fibrinolysis inhibition is known to occur in burn wounds, but its role in other injuries is unknown. The antagonism of this inhibitor by ibuprofen maintains vascular patency. The clinical use of ibuprofen will increase as research further elucidates the mechanisms of tissue injury in acute situations and the many and varied mechanisms of action of ibuprofen.\r"

Morphine significantly reduced glucose utilization by 10% in whole brain and by about 5% to 15% in telencephalic areas and the cerebellar cortex, assuming no contribution of hypercapnia. When the contribution of PaCO2 (45 minutes after morphine was administered) was partialled out, significant morphine-induced reductions persisted in whole brain and six cortical areas. Irrespective of morphine, left-greater-than-right asymmetry occurred in the temporal cortex, and an interaction between hemisphere and drug was noted in the postcentral gyrus. In most cases, effects on glucose utilization were not significantly related to measures of euphoria.\r"

This was removed at craniotomy and proved histologically to be a diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Further investigation showed no evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body. Immunohistochemical studies with an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies showed the tumor cells to be T cells staining with the markers UCHL1, MT1, OKT3, and OKT11. Cells of the helper phenotype predominated. A small admixed reactive population of polyclonal B cells and macrophages was also present. The proliferation count as judged with the antibody Ki67 was about 15%. Primary cerebral lymphoma is in itself a rare entity with most cases being of B-cell origin.

A slight predominance of node-based presentations was observed. Seventeen patients (71%) presented with advanced (stage III or IV) disease. Complete remissions were achieved in 13 (59%) of 22 patients, and 14 (58%) of the 24 patients were still alive after a follow-up period ranging from 10 to 124 months. The 1-year survival was 65% (SE = 10%). Relapses occurred in 4 (31%) of 13 patients with complete responses.

Immunoperoxidase stains for collagen type IV (basal lamina) were also performed. Transitional mucosa showed morphological alterations, including increase in mucosal thickness and crypt distortion. An increase in lamina propria fibrosis was noted in transitional mucosa in 3 cases. Abnormal mucin content, consisting of a predominance of sialomucin, was noted in transitional mucosa in 12 cases. In one of these, sialomucin was predominant in both transitional and normal mucosa. No alterations in the thickness of the subepithelial collagen table were noted. Collagen type IV staining was effective in demonstrating an increase in lamina propria vascularity in transitional mucosa in 11 specimens.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity of the ER-ICA, compared with the DCCA, were 92% and 89%, respectively. We describe the ER-ICA technique and review the literature regarding the use of the ER-ICA in evaluating breast cancer with respect to the agreement of results with the DCCA, the nature of discordant results, the ability to predict the clinical response to hormone therapy, and the ability to predict disease-free survival. The combined experience of many studies has shown that the ER-ICA is a highly specific and sensitive method for measuring the level of ERs in breast tumors with a high level of agreement with the DCCA. Early experience has suggested that the ER-ICA can predict the response to hormone therapy and disease-free survival, as well as or better than the DCCA. The evaluation of receptor heterogeneity, made possible by the ER-ICA, may enhance our ability to discriminate ER-positive tumors with a relatively high risk of recurrence.\r"

We studied polymorphonuclear leukocyte neutrophil (PMN) function in 14 patients who were admitted for elective surgery and compared them with 5 healthy controls. At admission, patients were classified according to their delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response into reactive or anergic groups. In vivo PMN delivery to skin windows, the plasma lactoferrin level, serum and skin window fluid chemoattractant activity, and in vitro superoxide production were measured. Compared with reactive patients, anergic patients showed an increased cell delivery (8.7 x 10(6) PMNs per well vs 1.6 x 10(6) PMNs per well), an increased plasma lactoferrin level (4.4 +/- 1.5 mg/L vs 3.1 +/- 0.8 mg/L), an increased chemoattractant capacity of serum and skin window fluid (38 +/- 21 cells per high-power field vs 16.8 +/- 7.2 cells per high-power field), and an increased superoxide production. We concluded that nonspecific host defense, as reflected by PMNs, is enhanced in anergic patients before surgery and may not explain the increased susceptibility to infection.\r"

Based on a review of key issues of clinical need and experimental interest, research guidelines are proposed for investigations in this burgeoning research area. The guidelines include suggestions for sampling methods, population characterization, and control groups as well as a recommended core battery of neuropsychological tests for use in this population. It is hoped that these guidelines will advance knowledge about the neuropsychology of multiple sclerosis by helping to promote sound experimental design, facilitate cross-study comparison, and encourage multicenter collaborative efforts.\r"

The machines and their installation were costly, but have already proven useful for teaching and patient care. Plans for the second and third years of the MAClinical project include workstations for the faculty coordinators of clinical clerkships and expansion of workstations to affiliated hospitals where our students and residents rotate. Software will be expanded to include patient simulations and expert consultations. Medical practice, research, and teaching in the future will need to make more use of information technology. It is not yet clear exactly how and where computers will best serve clinical medicine, but the teaching hospital can be both a laboratory for developing applications and a school for training physicians to use them.\r"

Hyposmia and hypogeusia, impairments of smell and taste, respectively, have a variety of causes, such as upper respiratory infection, head trauma, or laryngectomy. Once definitive diagnosis is established, eligibility and exclusion criteria may relate to etiology. Since the sense of smell is more acute at younger ages and since women can generally identify odors more accurately than men, either prestratification or poststratification should be considered. A control or comparison group is essential because, occasionally, chemosenses spontaneously return to normal. Patient recruitment may be difficult, depending to a large extent on self-referrals, with the exception of head injury cases. To enroll an adequate number of patients in a reasonable length of time usually requires participation of multiple clinical centers. Objective measurements of taste and smell must be reliably obtained before and after intervention. Design issues specific to chemosensory trials are discussed in the context of an example, a factorial design trial of surgery and steroids in patients with olfactory defects.\r"

Multiple regression with fibrinogen, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, smoking habits, coronary artery score, and left ventricular ejection fraction as independent variables showed a significant partial correlation between fibrinogen and the photometric erythrocyte aggregation index (r2 = 0.20) and plasma viscosity (r2 = 0.09), between triglycerides and plasma viscosity (r2 = 0.05), and between aortic pressure and erythrocyte filterability (r2 = 0.03). Logistic regression for unstable/stable angina with the haemorrheological variables as independent variables correctly identified 72% of the patients with stable angina and 78% of those with unstable angina. Inclusion of all the variables investigated did not substantially improve the discriminative potential of the logistic regression model. Unstable angina is associated with an impairment of blood fluidity that is essentially independent of risk factor profile and angiographic data.\r"

Three hundred and forty five men without a history of myocardial infarction were studied. One hundred and twenty three were apparently healthy. Less than half (170) had coronary artery disease. All had a normal electrocardiogram at rest. A Frank lead electrocardiogram was computer processed during symptom limited bicycle ergometry. The accuracy of the exercise score (a) was low (sensitivity 67%, specificity 90%). Discriminant analysis (b) and ST segment amplitude changes adjusted for heart rate (c) had excellent diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90%), which were little affected by concomitant use of beta blockers. Both methods seem well suited for diagnostic application in clinical practice.\r"

Significant stenosis or occlusion of one or more carotid arteries was discovered in eight patients with retinal artery occlusion, while the ultrasonic findings were normal in all the controls (p less than 0.005). Blood flow was evaluated by the same method in 16 patients with central retinal vein occlusion (mean age 57, SD 9, years) six to 48 months after the event. A control group was chosen according to the same criteria as in previous comparison. Pathological ultrasonic findings were observed neither in the patients with retinal vein occlusion nor in the control group. The results suggested a possible aetiological relation between pathological changes in the carotid arteries and occlusion of the central retinal artery, but not occlusion of the central retinal vein.\r"

After three months eight eyes in patients with haemodilution improved, whereas none of the untreated eyes had better visual acuity (p less than 0.01). Thirteen haemodiluted and 11 control patients could be observed for one year. Six eyes of the haemodiluted patients retained a better visual acuity, whereas no improvements had occurred in the control group (p less than 0.025). In fluorescein angiography the lowering of the packed cell volume to 35-32% accelerated the time of maximal venous filling (tmvf) from 17.4 (SEM 1.4) s to 11.4 (SEM 0.9) s (p less than 0.005). In patients with non-ischaemic CRVO without treatment the passage time did not change. The shortened tmvf reflects a higher blood velocity. Thus isovolaemic haemodilution improves the visual prognosis in non-ischaemic CRVO probably by inducing a higher blood fluidity, which results in higher blood velocity, at least in areas of compromised retinal microcirculation.\r"

  ".W": "Hodgkin's disease of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity subtypes is frequently associated with eosinophilia. To determine if interleukin-5 (IL-5) is implicated in producing the eosinophilia, we performed in situ hybridization studies on cytopreparations of 16 cases of Hodgkin's disease with eosinophilia as well as cells from various controls. A single-stranded, anti-sense complementary DNA (cDNA) probe coding for a portion of the human IL-5 molecule was tail-labeled with digoxigenin -11-dUTP using terminal transferase, and then hybridized to messenger RNA (mRNA) within cells. An alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody directed to digoxigenin was used with a chromogenic substrate to detect hybridized probe within cells. In all seven cases of nodular sclerosis subtype and nine cases of mixed cellularity subtype with eosinophilia, there was strong hybridization signal localizable to the cytoplasm of morphologically identifiable Reed-Sternberg cells and variants. Similar activity was detected only in rare cells from three normal spleens, and was undetectable in two cell lines used as a negative control and in one case of Hodgkin's disease without eosinophilia. Pretreatment of the cytopreparations with the RNase inhibitor diethylpyrocarbonate greatly increased the hybridization signal. Based on this controlled study, we conclude that mRNA coding for IL-5 is expressed in Reed-Sternberg cells and variants. This observation may explain the eosinophilia associated with Hodgkin's disease and provide insight into the origin of the Reed-Sternberg cell.\r"

Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 43% (SE = 4%). Factors examined included white blood cell (WBC) level, age, gender, race (black v other), presence of a mediastinal mass, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, marked lymphadenopathy, hemoglobin level, platelet count, blast cell expression of antigens such as the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA, CD10), HLA-DR, and T-cell-associated antigens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD5, and THY). Univariate analysis showed that age less than or equal to 5 or less than or equal to 7 years, WBC level less than 10, less than 25, less than 50 or less than 100 x 10(3)/microL, and blast cell expression of CD4, CD8, or CALLA were associated with significantly better EFS, while hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were associated with worse EFS. Recursive partitioning analysis showed that the most important single favorable prognostic factor was a WBC level less than 50 x 10(3)/microL and, for patients with WBC counts below this level, the most important predictor of EFS was blast cell expression of the pan-T antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody (MoAb), L17F12 (CD5). For patients with higher WBC levels, the most important predictor of EFS was blast cell expression of THY antigen. The recursive partitioning analysis defined three groups of patients with widely varied prognoses identified as follows: (1) those with a WBC count less than 50 x 10(3)/microL who lacked massive splenomegaly and had blasts expressing CD5 had the best prognosis (66%, SE = 7%, EFS 4 years, n = 84); (2) those with (b1) WBC counts less than 50 x 10(3)/microL with either massive splenomegaly or who had blasts lacking CD5 expression, or (b2) WBC counts greater than 50 x 10(3)/microL with expression of the THY antigen had an intermediate prognosis (39%, SE = 7% EFS at 4 years, n = 94); (3) those with WBC counts greater than 50 x 10(3)/microL and whose blasts lacked expression of THY antigen had the poorest outcome (EFS = 19% at 4 years, SE = 8%, n = 63). A three-way comparison of EFS according to these groupings showed significant differences among the three patient groups (P less than .001). The recursive partitioning was able to classify 241 (95%) of the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

On a possibility that IFN-alpha may operate as one of the inhibitory feedback factors in neutropoiesis, we examined whether neutrophils produce IFN-alpha in response to G-CSF. Northern blot analysis showed that messenger RNA (mRNA) for human IFN-alpha 1 became detectable time-dependently in highly purified human neutrophils incubated with purified recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF). But such transcription was not observed either in neutrophils incubated with other neutrophil activators, such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), or in blood mononuclear cells incubated with rhG-CSF. In addition, radioimmunoassay for human IFN-alpha showed that its levels in culture medium of the rhG-CSF-treated neutrophils rose markedly (up to approximately 100 IU/mL/1 x 10(7) cells) in a time-dependent way, compared with those of nonstimulated neutrophils. These findings suggest that the G-CSF/IFN-alpha system may participate in the feedback regulatory loop of neutropoiesis.\r"

Six of 27 (22%) blast crisis samples and 3 of 5 (60%) accelerated phase samples had rearrangements of chromosome 17, whereas only 3 of 42 (7%) chronic phase patients had cytogenetic changes in chromosome 17. There was no loss of heterozygosity during the transition to blastic crisis among seven individuals who were informative for polymorphic probes for regions in or around the p53 gene on 17p. One patient in the chronic phase and one patient in the blastic phase of the 61 CML patients studied exhibited rearrangements of the p53 gene that were detectable by Southern analysis. One p53 allele was rearranged in the chronic phase patient and both p53 alleles were rearranged in the blastic phase patient. The p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) was of normal size (2.8 kb) in chronic phase and blast crisis, and the expression of the p53 gene was at least as high or higher in blast crisis as in the chronic phase of CML. The high incidence of abnormalities of chromosome 17 in blast-crisis CML found in our studies and the discovery of rearrangements of the p53 gene in two CML patients studied suggest that further study with probes for the p53 gene and anonymous polymorphic sites in chromosome 17 should be conducted in CML.\r"

Increasing the radiation dose shortened the preleukemic latent period, and in female mice the frequency of leukemia development was higher and the latent period shorter than in male mice. In the preleukemic period, the injected FDC-P1 cells rapidly increased in number in hematopoietic organs of irradiated animals, reaching peak levels 3 to 5 weeks after injection; factor-independent transformed cells were not detected before day 45. In unirradiated animals, these events were delayed by several weeks, and long-term survivors did not harbor detectable FDC-P1 cells. FDC-P1 cells sampled from preleukemic mice frequently showed atypical colony formation and reduced cloning efficiency in vitro, suggesting the occurrence of a distinct preleukemic change. U16.6 cells produced leukemia only in irradiated recipients, and the leukemic cells usually remained factor dependent. The two contrasting models should be of value in further analyzing the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced leukemias.\r"

  ".U": "90105685\r", 
  ".W": "The CD11/CD18 family of glycoproteins has been identified as a mediator of a number of adhesive interactions crucial to inflammatory responses. Using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against CD18 (TS1/18), the role of these molecules in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMNL) adhesion to cultured primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was examined under venous flow conditions. Incubation of PMNL with TS1/18 (anti-CD18) did not inhibit PMNL adhesion to interleukin-1 (IL-1)-treated HUVEC at 2.0 dynes/cm2 (TS1/18-treated 305 +/- 58 PMNL/mm2 v 334 +/- 63 PMNL/mm2 on control). Furthermore, incubation of HUVEC with R6.5.D6, an MoAb against intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) did not significantly inhibit PMNL adhesion to IL-1-treated HUVEC at 2.0 dynes/cm2 (P greater than .3). In contrast to the lack of inhibition of adhesion under conditions of flow, incubation of PMNL with TS1/18 reduced PMNL adherence in static adhesion assays. PMNL migration beneath HUVEC monolayers has been shown to be stimulated by 4-hour IL-1 treatment. TS1/18 and R6.5.D6 significantly inhibited migration of PMNL beneath IL-1-treated HUVEC monolayers under flow conditions by slightly more than 80% (P less than .005). In flow experiments with CD18-deficient PMNL, virtually no transendothelial migration was observed. The effect of FMLP (10(-8) mol/L) on PMNL adhesion to untreated HUVEC at wall shear stresses ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 dynes/cm2 was also investigated. FMLP had little effect on PMNL adherence at shear stresses above 0.5 dynes/cm2 (P greater than .45). In response to FMLP exposure at lower wall shear stresses, PMNL adherence to untreated HUVEC increased 6.9-fold at 0.5 dynes/cm2 (P less than .001). At 0.25 dynes/cm2, FMLP stimulation increased PMNL adherence to untreated HUVEC 6.5-fold compared with controls (P less than .005), and FMLP failed to make CD18-deficient PMNL more adherent. In experiments with PMNL pretreated with TS1/18 (anti-CD18), there was a 67% inhibition of FMLP-stimulated adhesion at 0.5 dynes/cm2 (P less than .025). The upper threshold of CD18-mediated PMNL adhesion appears to be between 0.5 and 1.0 dyne/cm2. Above these wall shear stresses, the initial attachment of PMNL to cultured endothelium was mediated almost exclusively by CD18-independent mechanisms. By simulating some of the flow parameters in the microcirculation with well-characterized shear forces, PMNL adhesion by CD18-independent and dependent mechanisms can be differentiated. These data also indicate that CD18 is an important mediator of transendothelial migration by PMNL, which have attached to the endothelium by a CD18-independent mechanism.\r"

Affinity labeling with tritiated diisopropylfluorophosphate (3H-DFP) suggested that ANCA-antigen is a serine protease. We used immunoelectron microscopy to study the in situ localization of the ANCA-antigen in normal human neutrophils and monocytes using immunoglobulin G (IgG) from ANCA-positive patients and a mouse monoclonal antibody against the ANCA-antigen. Label was observed on the large granules of the neutrophils and in granules of monocytes. Double-labeling, using anti-myeloperoxidase or the peroxidase reaction as markers for azurophil granules and anti-lactoferrin as marker for specific granules, showed that ANCA is colocalized with markers of azurophil granules but not with lactoferrin. Furthermore, elastase and cathepsin G were found in the azurophil granules of neutrophils and in the peroxidase-positive granules of monocytes, colocalized with ANCA-antigen. Cytochalasin-B-treated neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) formed large intracellular vacuoles and were partially degranulated. Some vacuoles contained ANCA-antigen, as well as myeloperoxidase, elastase, and cathepsin G, demonstrating release of these enzymes from the azurophil granules into vacuoles. Our results demonstrate that ANCA-antigen is located in myeloperoxidase-containing granules of neutrophils and monocytes, and is packaged in the same granules as elastase and cathepsin G, the two previously identified serine proteases of myeloid leukocytes.\r"

Patients achieving complete remission (CR) received two courses of consolidation therapy (5-2 or 5-2-5) followed by maintenance therapy. Of 264 eligible patients, CR occurred in 56% of 7-3 and 59% of 7-3-7 patients; 7-3-7 significantly improved remission duration (P = .01). The median remission duration was 12 months for 7-3 and 18 months for 7-3-7. Survival was similar when the two arms were compared overall.

Survival appeared to be prolonged with 7-3-7 in patients aged less than 55 years, with a median of 9 months for 7-3 as compared with 17 months for 7-3-7 (P = .03). In older patients (aged greater than or equal to 55 years), 7-3-7 was more toxic, with significantly more severe [World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4] stomatitis (P = .02) and no additional clinical benefit. Hematologic toxicity for induction courses was similar, with granulocytopenia less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L for a median of 16 days per course for 7-3 and 15 days for 7-3-7. Hematologic toxicity was more severe for 5-2-5 consolidation courses (P = .003).

Seven patients received IV-IgG and five patients received placebo. Although platelet recovery in 1 to 6 hours was satisfactory in five patients after IV-IgG treatment, 24-hour survival was not improved in most patients. None of the patients receiving the placebo achieved satisfactory 1-hour platelet-corrected count increments (CCIs). By t test, the posttreatment mean values 1 hour after transfusion CCIs in the IV-IgG group were significantly greater than in the control group (8,413 v 1,050, P less than .007). Using a regression model to adjust for any distributional assumptions of the study population, the parameter estimate for IV-IgG treatment was positive, indicating that IV-IgG treatment is associated with higher CCIs. Although IV-IgG may improve 1-hour platelet recovery, clinical benefit was not demonstrated since 24-hour survival was not improved. IV-IgG treatment before unmatched platelet transfusions should not be considered as a replacement for HLA-compatible platelets in alloimmunized patients.\r"

The bone marrow (BM) at 12 hours is depleted of mature neutrophils and shows a left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia, consistent with the neutrophil-releasing and myeloproliferative activities of both IL-3 and G-CSF individually. The BM at 24 hours shows a replenished reserve of mature neutrophils and a synergistic left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia as compared with IL-3 and G-CSF alone. Daily IV injections of IL-3 plus G-CSF for 1 week also induce an approximately additive daily peripheral neutrophilia. The BM after a week's administration of IL-3 plus G-CSF shows a generalized myeloid hyperplasia with a synergistic increase in mature neutrophils as compared with IL-3 or G-CSF alone. Daily injection of IL-3 plus G-CSF induced a significant decrease in erythroid, lymphoid, and eosinophilic marrow precursors, possibly owing to a myelophthisic effect of the myeloid hyperplasia and despite the fact that IL-3 alone induced a significant erythroid hyperplasia.\r"

We determined that outgrowth of such clones may be reproducibly modulated by supplementation of cultures with the hematopoietic growth factors GM-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Continuous supplementation of cultures with GM-CSF facilitates emergence of immortalized B-cell clones, whereas supplementation with IL-3 completely prevents their emergence. The effect of GM-CSF may be direct, at least in part, as the proliferation of pure clones of EBV-transformed B lymphocytes was augmented in response to GM-CSF. An indirect mechanism appears to be responsible for the inhibition of transformed B-cell outgrowth in response to IL-3, as IL-3 had no inhibitory effect on proliferation of pure transformed B-cell clones and IL-3-mediated inhibition could be eliminated by antibody neutralization of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) early in culture. The mechanisms of these effects deserve further study and may have clinical relevance to use of hematopoietic growth factors for support of bone marrow (BM) function in immunocompromised patients.\r"

There was some heterogeneity in the number of GM-CSF binding sites per cell. To determine whether the low level of binding to some patient samples may be attributed to receptor occupancy by an endogenous source of GM-CSF, we devised an acid wash procedure that could remove surface-bound GM-CSF without affecting receptor properties. We thus document that GM-CSF specific binding to AML blasts before or after acid wash was the same, indicating that the observed heterogeneity in binding is not the result of receptor occupancy by an endogeneous source of GM-CSF. Saturation analyses are in favor of the presence of two classes of binding sites on AML blasts: a high-affinity receptor that binds GM-CSF with a dissociation constant (kd) of 3 to 73 pmol/L and a second class of low-affinity receptor that binds GM-CSF with a kd of 1 to 10 nmol/L. Binding studies with two established cell lines KG-1, and IRCM-8 also showed the presence of two classes of binding sites with high and low affinities. Analysis of GM-CSF titration curves in culture indicate that the median effective concentration required for stimulation of blast colony formation (EC50 = 5-36 pmol/L) were in the range of the kd of the high-affinity binding site, suggesting that this high-affinity binding site mediates the proliferative response.\r"

  ".W": "A truncated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) allele on a putative 5q- chromosome of HL-60 cells was cloned and, by comparison with counterpart normal sequences, analyzed for clues to molecular mechanisms facilitating rearrangement and deletion. Within the 17-kilobase (kb) pair locus surrounding the truncated GM-CSF gene remnant, there are no fewer than four rearranged genomic fragments that seemingly derive from chromosome 5 region q21----23. Two of the fragments, which flank the truncated GM-CSF locus on the 5q-, are contiguous on the normal chromosome 5, centrometric to the normal GM-CSF allele, indicating at least one intrachromosomal insertion event, either preceded or followed by further deletion. Insertion and/or deletion was accompanied by juxtaposition of LINE sequences to the 5' side of the truncated GM-CSF locus within the inserted fragment. The entire rearranged locus is embedded in repetitive sequences, which may have mediated successive insertions or deletions. The extent of such stepwise deletions, resulting in loss of genes such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF, whose gene products are critical to differentiation within the lineage of the affected hematopoietic stem cell, may be mirrored in the heterogeneity of symptoms and 5q- deletion sizes observed in myelodysplasias and acute leukemias carrying a 5q- chromosome. Perhaps most significantly, the sequences surrounding the insertion/deletion region are suggestive of recombination signals, including direct repeats and mirrored repeats. The site of insertion of the GM-CSF 3' region into an upstream (centromeric) locus is flanked by direct repeats; the upstream site into which it is inserted is also flanked by 12 base pair (bp) direct repeats. After insertion, one member of each pair of repeats is lost. The organization of this rearranged locus implies that direct repeats had a role in the intrachromosomal recombination/deletion event.\r"

  ".U": "90105714\r", 
  ".W": "Long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) allow the proliferation and differentiation of primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells to be maintained for many weeks in the absence of exogenously provided hematopoietic growth factors. Previous investigations focused on defining various types of cells that are present in this culture system and on measuring the cycling behavior of the different subpopulations of colony-forming cells maintained within it. These studies suggested that mesenchymal stromal elements derived from the input marrow play a key role in regulating the turnover of the most primitive, high-proliferative potential erythroid and granulopoietic colony-forming cells that are found almost exclusively in the adherent layer of LTMC. In this study we show that the re-entry into S-phase of these primitive hematopoietic progenitors that occurs after each weekly medium change is due to an as yet undefined constituent of horse serum, which is absent from fetal calf serum. However, this effect is not unique to the factor present in horse serum. It is also elicited by the addition to LTMC of several well-defined growth regulatory molecules, ie, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), and IL-2. None of these was able to stimulate hematopoietic colony-forming cells in methylcellulose assays, although all have known actions on mesenchymal cells including, in some cases, the ability to increase production of growth factors that can stimulate primitive high-proliferative potential hematopoietic progenitors in clonogenic assays. Interestingly, a stimulating effect was not obtained after addition of endotoxin to LTMC. TGF-beta, a direct-acting negative regulator that acts selectively on primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells if added to LTMC simultaneously with new medium or IL-1, blocked their stimulating activity. These results suggest a model in which indirect, local modulation of both positive and negative regulatory factors via effects on mesenchymal elements determines the rate of turnover of adjacent populations of very primitive hematopoietic cells that are normally maintained in a quiescent state in vivo.\r"

We have developed a new assay for the native prothrombin antigen that measures the fully gamma-carboxylated prothrombin using a radioimmunoassay. Based on preliminary data that indicated that the native prothrombin antigen predicted both bleeding and thrombotic complications more accurately than the prothrombin time in patients anticoagulated with warfarin sodium, we have performed a randomized prospective trial comparing the complication rate in warfarin-treated patients monitored with the native prothrombin antigen or the prothrombin time. Patients with indications for anticoagulation were randomized to be monitored by the native prothrombin antigen (therapeutic range, 12 to 24 micrograms/mL) or the prothrombin time index (therapeutic range, 1.5 to 2.0). Of the prothrombin time group (N = 80), seven (8.8%) had bleeding or thrombotic complications, with a complication rate of 9.5%/patient-year. In the native prothrombin antigen group (N = 76), one subject (1.3%) had a bleeding complication. The complication rate per patient-year was 1.5%. These results indicate an 85% reduction in the complication rate of the native prothrombin antigen group compared with the complication rate of the prothrombin time group. This difference is statistically significant by the Fisher exact test (P = .037) and by Kaplan Meier survival analysis (P = .040). This study suggests that the use of the native prothrombin antigen assay has the potential to decrease the complications associated with anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium.\r"

  ".U": "90105718\r", 
  ".W": "We demonstrated the significant eosinophilic growth of leukemic cells in the presence of interleukin-5 (IL-5) in 2 of 15 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. These two cases were M2 (FAB classification) with the translocation (8;21)(q22; q22). Bone marrow examination revealed the rather high percentages (6% and 9%) of atypical eosinophils in the total nucleated bone marrow cells in these two cases. In the remaining 13 cases, eosinophils were less than 2% in the nucleated bone marrow cells. In the methylcellulose culture system, 142 +/- 18 or 54 +/- 2 colonies were formed by 5 x 10(4) mononuclear cells in the presence of IL-5 in these two cases. These colonies mainly comprised mature eosinophils. Eosinophils were confirmed by Biebrich scarlet staining and electron microscopic examination using a specific lectin binding assay. The eosinophilic differentiation and proliferation of leukemic cells were also observed in the liquid culture system. It was shown that eosinophils observed in both systems were derived from leukemic cells using the chromosomal marker of leukemic cells, t(8;21). Leukemic cells also differentiated to neutrophils or both neutrophils and eosinophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, respectively, but did not respond noticeably to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Although IL-5 acts on normal eosinophil committed precursors as a lineage-specific growth factor, at least some leukemic cells reacted to IL-5 and could proliferate and differentiate along eosinophilic pathway. Our findings suggest that atypical eosinophils observed in the bone marrow were derived from the leukemic clone in two cases of AML.\r"

We hypothesized that hemonectin is an important marker of fetal granulopoiesis that is developmentally regulated during the ontogeny of the hematopoietic system. Murine hematopoiesis originates in the yolk sac and subsequently appears in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to purified hemonectin as a probe of developing hematopoietic organs, we observe that hemonectin is coordinately expressed at developmental stages of the mouse in those tissues that are supporting hematopoiesis. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis reveals that approximately 7% of fetal liver cells express hemonectin by day 13 of gestation, and that 32% of the cells are positive by day 19. Additionally, restricted hemonectin expression is noted in other tissues (cartilage, skin, developing bone, and capillary endothelial cells), suggesting that this molecule subserves other developmental functions and/or belongs to a previously unrecognized family of molecules.\r"

Fetal cells from both sheep and humans exhibited a higher degree of NeoR transfer than adult cells. The overall level of NeoR expression was significantly higher for sheep than human cells. The transfer/expression of NeoR into adult human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors was not affected by the presence or absence of T cells and monocyte/macrophages. The efficiency of NeoR transfer into both adult and fetal human cells, however, was improved when transduction was carried out in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These results demonstrate the greater efficiency of NeoR gene transfer into fetal hematopoietic progenitors, which may provide a basis for the relatively higher efficiency of the in utero approach to gene therapy.\r"

  ".U": "90105731\r", 
  ".W": "The hallmarks of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) include the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation [t (9;22)(q34;q11)] and consistent molecular genetic aberrations: a break within a restricted 5.8 kb DNA segment, bcr, on chromosome 22q11; transposition of the c-abl protooncogene from chromosome 9q34 to 22q11; and formation of a hybrid bar-abl gene encoding an abnormal 210 Kd bcr-abl protein with augmented tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity. These molecular phenomena may occur even in the absence of cytogenetic evidence of the Ph translocation. They are highly specific and sensitive markers for CML, and are presumed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Surprisingly, we have encountered 11 patients who lacked the Ph translocation, bcr rearrangement, and (in the four patients with available mRNA) a bcr-abl message, and yet had a disease phenotype at diagnosis that was a morphologic facsimile of classic chronic phase CML. These patients presented with high white blood cell counts, neutrophilia, occasional basophilia, splenomegaly, and a hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic hyperplasia and a left shift in myeloid maturation. Despite the striking resemblance between the early stages of bcr-negative and bcr-positive CML, disease progression manifests distinctly in these two disorders. In contrast to the blastic transformation that inevitably complicates bcr-positive CML, the natural history of our 11 Ph-negative, bcr-negative CML patients was characterized by increasing leukemia burden with leukocytosis, pronounced organomegaly, extramedullary infiltrates, and eventual bone marrow failure (anemia and thrombocytopenia) without marked increases in blast cells. Our current observations suggest that a chronic myeloid leukemia process can develop without associated changes in the bcr or c-abl genes. Although the initial phase of this disease is indistinguishable from CML, the presence or absence of molecular markers may aid in the prediction of the clinical course of Ph-negative CML.\r"

Of 18 patients completing the above protocol, a biochemical improvement was observed in 12, of whom eight became normocalcaemic during the follow-up period of 6 months after the last treatment. An obvious clinical improvement was seen in eight of the patients. In four patients, a unilateral vocal cord paralysis was observed, but was permanent in only one patient. Progressive fibrosis of the parathyroid tumours following injections impeded the intraglandular dissemination of ethanol. Another problem noted was the inability of ultrasound to detect multiglandular involvement. We find ultrasound-guided chemical parathyroidectomy an attractive alternative to surgery in patients who are not well suited for surgical intervention. However, the technique has not been fully developed, and in the present study, possible improvements are indicated.\r"

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is related to microadenomatous structure and mid-range echoes, whilst cancer is related to amorphous structure and low echoes. A small number of cancers have irregular calcification present and these tumours are related to high echoes. The structure of the prostate gland is therefore related to its pathology and explains its ultrasound echogenicity.\r"

These patients were referred to a centre with an interest in pancreatic disease at a median time of 6.0 months (range 1.5-34 months) after blunt (n = 9) or penetrating (n = 2) injury to the pancreas. Ten of the 11 patients had undergone either single (n = 4) or multiple (n = 6) previous operations. Ten of the 11 patients had either strictures or disruptions of the main pancreatic duct demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and ultrasonography (n = 8) or by exploration of the pancreas (n = 2). Satisfactory results were achieved by non-operative treatment in one patient and by distal pancreatectomy in eight. One further patient, who underwent distal pancreatectomy, later required completion resection because of unsuspected ductal injury in the head of the gland. The final patient continued with symptoms of pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy. It is concluded that the non-resolving sequelae of pancreatic trauma are associated with injury to the main pancreatic duct and that specialist investigation should be performed before surgical intervention is contemplated.\r"

With placebo all patients experienced the subjective symptoms of the early dumping syndrome with significant (P less than 0.001) increases (mean (s.d.)) in pulse rate (from 66 (8) to 102 (10) beats/min), in packed cell volume (from 0.36 (0.05) to 0.43 (0.1) l/l) and in the plasma levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (from 3.0 (0.5) to 10.2 (1.8) pmol/l). During the somatostatin study the subjective symptoms and the changes in the various parameters were not detected. In the control study seven patients showed postprandial hypoglycemia. In these patients significant elevations (P less than 0.001) in the insulin level (from 10 (0.9) to 40 (9.1) microE/ml) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) concentration (from 100 (13) to 220 (41) ng/l) were seen, compared with the initial values. During the application of SMS 201-995 hypoglycaemia did not develop and plasma insulin and GIP concentrations remained unchanged.

  ".W": "Arteriosclerotic narrowing of cerebral arteries was once viewed as the key to mental decline. As Alzheimer's disease gained recognition and the concept of multi-infarct dementia achieved acceptance, vascular dementia came to be regarded as uncommon. The changing nature of cerebral vascular disease, the aging of the population and the widespread use of brain imaging techniques have brought new prominence to vascular dementia, chiefly in the form of an epidemic of \"Binswanger's disease\". Growing evidence suggests that not only grey matter lesions but also white matter lesions contribute to dementia, that vascular factors commonly coexist and interact with Alzheimer changes and that Alzheimer's disease has a vascular and potentially treatable component. Vascular dementia needs to be redefined, reappraised and reinvestigated.\r"

  ".W": "Twice-daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute otitis media except that caused by group A beta-streptococci. Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium is effective in vitro against all bacterial pathogens causing acute otitis media and has been reported to be effective when given twice daily for urinary tract infections, acute otitis media and respiratory tract infections. To determine whether the in-vitro efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate carries over clinically, we conducted a prospective randomized double-blind trial in 219 children presenting at a pediatric walk-in clinic. Diagnosis and follow-up assessments were made by means of examination of the tympanic membrane and acoustic otoscopy. Of the 219 children 202 (101 in either group) were assessed by a specially trained nurse at a follow-up visit 12 to 16 (mean 14) days after treatment was begun. Cure was defined as absence of symptoms and normal results of both visual inspection of the tympanic membrane and acoustic reflectometry; improvement was defined as absence of symptoms and either normal appearance of the tympanic membrane or normal results of acoustic reflectometry; treatment failure was defined as abnormal appearance of the tympanic membrane along with an acoustic reflectometry reading of 5 units or more. There were no differences in age (mean 60 months), sex or proportion of subjects with unilateral versus bilateral disease between the two groups. The combined rate of cure an improvement was significantly higher with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (93%) than with amoxicillin-clavulanate (82%) (p = 0.03). The rate of compliance (more than 80% of the drug taken) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Gastrointestinal side effects were more common with amoxicillin-clavulanate (p less than 0.0001). Our results suggest that for acute otitis media twice-daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more effective clinically and produces fewer side effects than twice-daily amoxicillin-clavulanate.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade, much has been learned about the pathophysiology of ACH--yet much remains to be determined. Although LC, IL-1, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and the T effector circuits have been extensively studied, it is still not clear whether it is LC- or keratinocyte-derived IL-1 that is crucial in ACH, whether IL-1 acts primarily on T-cells or the APC, whether other cytokines are involved in the circuit (TNF, KTGF?), the exact relationships between T effector, T memory, and other T helper cells, what the functions of mast cells and basophils are in the allergic reaction, and how the regulatory circuits (including prostaglandins and eicosanoids) affect the outcome of ACH. The mechanism of suppression remains even less well understood despite the potential application of this knowledge to the treatment of diseases caused by Type IV hypersensitivity. A better understanding of the ACH mechanism will lead not only to more sophisticated ACH treatment, but also to a better understanding of the cell-mediated events of cutaneous viral replication, organ transplantation, and tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "The current trial was designed to assess whether the addition of prednisone or prednisone + tamoxifen would enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of 1 year of adjuvant CMF therapy. Premenopausal women with ipsilateral axillary node-positive breast carcinoma and known estrogen receptor (ER) status were randomized to receive 1 year of postoperative treatment with 12 28-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF), CMF plus prednisone (CMFP), or CMFP plus tamoxifen (CMFPT). There were 553 analyzed cases with 188 receiving CMF, 183 CMFP, and 182 CMFPT. The overall time to relapse (TTR) and survival comparisons between the regimens are not statistically different at a median follow-up time of 7.7 years. The major subgroups currently with a suggestive TTR difference are greater than 3N+ (CMFPT greater than CMF, P = 0.07) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) greater than 3N+ (CMFPT greater than CMF, P = 0.03). Patients receiving CMFPT appeared to have a superior survival to CMF in the ER- greater than 3N+ cohort (P = 0.02). The following patient characteristics were associated with a significantly longer TTR: decreasing nodal involvement or tumor size, positive ER status, age greater than or equal to 40 years, and decreasing obesity. The favorable effects of decreasing nodal involvement, positive ER status, age 40 years or greater, and decreasing obesity carried over to survival. Development of amenorrhea was also significantly associated with improved survival (P = 0.001). Toxicity was increased by the addition of prednisone to CMF and by the addition of tamoxifen to CMFP. Overall relapse patterns were similar among the three regimens. The results of the current trial do not currently suggest an overall therapeutic benefit for adding prednisone or only 1 year of tamoxifen to CMF adjuvant treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental study using nude mice human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft indicated that the combination treatment with iodine 131 (131I)-anti-human HCC isoferritin (131I-isoFtAb), cisplatin, and mixed bacterial vaccine (MBV) yielded better inhibition rate as compared with double combination or 131I-isoFtAb alone. Based on these findings, 25 patients with surgically proven nonresectable and pathologically proven HCC have been treated by radioimmunotherapy using 131I-isoFtAb intrahepatic arterial infusion as a part of multimodality treatment. Of the 25 patients, seven (28.0%) received second-look resection after marked shrinkage of tumor. The 1-year survival was 52.5% (12/23) and 2-year survival 27.7% (five of 18) in the entire series. Of the five patients with 2-year survival, four were in the second-look resection group. Patients with tumor less than or equal to 8 cm showed higher second-look resection rate (62.5% versus 11.8%) and 1-year survival (85.7% versus 37.5%) as compared with tumor greater than 8 cm. Mixed bacterial vaccine as adjuvant immunotherapy seemed effective to prolong survival. The 2-year survival was higher in patients with second-look resection as compared with those without (75.0% versus 14.3%). Thus, radioimmunotherapy using 131I-isoFtAb might be one of the modalities of choice, particularly in the conversion of nonresectable to resectable HCC in a well-designed multimodality treatment regimen.\r"

Although numerous extragonadal EST have been reported, primary EST of the endometrium is exceedingly rare. To our knowledge this is the fourth documented case of this nature. The tumor had the typical microscopic features of EST, with papillary, tubular, reticular, and solid growth patterns; occasional Schiller-Duval bodies and many intracellular and extracellular periodic-acid Schiff positive hyaline globules were seen. The neoplastic cells stained positively for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), cytokeratin, and placental alkaline phosphatase. The globules were positive for AFP, A1AT, albumin, transferrin, and fibronectin. The tumor cells were negative for type IV collagen and the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (B hcG). Electron microscopic examination showed intracellular and extracellular basement membrane-like material, intracytoplasmic lumina with microvilli, and glycogen. The patient was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by four cycles of adjunct chemotherapy (vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatinum) repeated every 3 weeks. The serum AFP level was elevated significantly before the surgery and the tumor response was monitored by serial determination of serum AFP level. There was no evidence of recurrence 24 months after surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes (LDGL) is a recently recognized, relatively rare atypical lymphocytosis characterized by the presence of over 2000 lymphocytes with cytoplasmic azurophilic granules/mm3 in the peripheral blood. The clinical course is heterogeneous, varying from spontaneous regression to progressive, malignant disease. As a consequence, clinical intervention is not standardized. In a worldwide multicenter study, the authors observed 151 patients with LDGL for a mean follow-up time of 29 months. Forty-three patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In the remaining cases, clinical symptoms included fever (41 cases), infections (58), neutropenia (47), anemia (17), and thrombocytopenia (12). In 69 cases, LDGL coexisted with an associated disease. Most patients had a nonprogressive clinical course despite the presence of severe symptoms. In 19 patients, death related to LDGL occurred within 48 months. The authors investigated which features at diagnosis were significantly associated with increased mortality. In the univariate analysis, lymph node and liver enlargement, fever at presentation, skin infiltration, a low (less than or equal to 5000/mm3) or high (greater than 20,000/mm3) peripheral leukocyte count, relatively low (less than or equal to 3000) or high (greater than 7000/mm3) absolute peripheral granular lymphocyte (GL) count, and a low (less than or equal to 15%) percentage of HNK-1-positive cells were found to be predictors of increased mortality. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors were fever at diagnosis, a low (less than or equal to 15%) percentage of HNK-1-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a relatively low (less than or equal to 3000) GL count. These results showed that about 25% of the patients with LDGL were diagnosed after a routine blood count and had no clinical symptoms. The remaining patients were symptomatic, with some experiencing a fatal clinical course. The author's analysis of the significant prognostic features of LDGL may help in understanding the heterogeneous nature of this syndrome.\r"

The steroid regimen consisted of 125 mg methylprednisolone I.M. the night before and morning of the PTCA, and prednisone 60 mg p.o. Q.D. for 1 week. post-PTCA. Angiographic follow-up at 6 months was available in 27 steroid-treated patients (52%) and 27 controls (54%). The per lesion incidence of restenosis was similar in the two groups (36% vs. 40%, respectively, P = NS). Clinical follow-up was available in the remaining patients at a mean interval of 1.2 years. The clinical correlates of restenosis (incidence and severity of angina, positive treadmill exercise test, nonfatal infarction or death) were similar in the steroid treated and control groups (24% vs. 39%, respectively, P = .56). At late follow-up, 30 steroid-treated patients (58%) and 26 control patients (52%) had no clinical or angiographic evidence of restenosis (P = NS). In conclusion, a short course of high-dose corticosteroid therapy does not significantly reduce the frequency of restenosis following PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1847 anaesthesia in Canada has evolved through six phases. In the first (1847-1898), it was a craft without an academic and professional base. The second (1899-1919) was marked by the first academic appointments and by Canadians' wartime experiences of anaesthesia. The third phase (1920-1929) evidenced the professional satisfaction of anaesthesia and included the founding of the Canadian Society of Anaesthetists. In the fourth phase (1930-1943) the growth of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, the introduction of certification and the founding of the definitive professional society--the Canadian Anaesthetists' Society--fostered the evolution of what was now becoming a recognizable specialty. The fifth phase (1944-1971) was one of resolution of problems affecting the status of anaesthesia: the first autonomous department of anaesthesia in a Canadian university was founded (at McGill in 1945), the Royal College Fellowship was approved for anaesthesia (in 1951), the Canadian Anaesthetists' Society Journal was launched (in 1954) and a single standard for certification of specialists was finally established (in 1971). In the sixth (1972-1989), the main elements were the assumption of responsibility for residency training by the universities and by the renaming of the journal as the Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia. Through these years of increasing professionalism, it has, however, been the accomplishments of individual Canadian physicians, facing many challenges, that have made the specialty in Canada recognizably Canadian.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine the effects of various doses of succinylcholine on resting tension and evoked twitch height at the masseter and adductor pollicis muscles in children. Twenty patients, aged 3-10 yr, ASA physical status I or II, were randomly assigned to receive succinylcholine 0.15, 0.25, 0.50 or 1.00 mg.kg-1, during halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Supramaximal train-of-four stimulation was applied simultaneously to the ulnar nerve and the nerve to the masseter. Transducers recorded force at the jaw and the thumb. Maximum blockade of the first twitch (T1) and maximum resting tension change were measured. Potency of succinylcholine at the two muscles was estimated by linear regression of the logit transformation of T1 versus log dose. The relationship between resting tension change and log dose was established by linear regression. The masseter muscle was more sensitive to succinylcholine than the adductor pollicis with an ED95 of 0.28 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SEM) vs 0.44 +/- 0.05 mg.kg-1 (P less than 0.05). Onset of neuromuscular blockade was faster at the masseter, and recovery occurred simultaneously in both muscles. A dose-related increase in resting tension was observed in both muscles, but its magnitude was five times greater at the masseter. With succinylcholine, 1 mg.kg-1, this increase was 51.6 +/- 16.8 g at the masseter and 9.1 +/- 2.3 g at the adductor pollicis. Tension returned to baseline within 1-2 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect on gastric pH and volume of 0, 6 and 10 ml.kg-1, of apple juice given 2.5 hours before surgery to children aged five to ten years was investigated in this prospective, randomized, single-blind study. Gastric contents were aspirated after induction of anaesthesia, and the volume measured. The pH of the gastric aspirate was then assessed using pH paper. Neither gastric volume nor pH immediately following the induction of general anaesthesia were significantly different among the three groups. Gastric volumes after 0, 6 and 10 ml.kg-1, of juice averaged (mean +/- SD) 0.45 +/- 0.31, 0.66 +/- 0.79 and 0.71 +/- 0.76 ml.kg-1, respectively; gastric pH averaged 1.7 +/- 0.6, 1.7 +/- 0.6 and 1.8 +/- 0.8, respectively. On the basis of questions asked immediately before induction of anaesthesia, patients who drank 6 ml.kg-1 of apple juice had decreased thirst and were less irritable and upset before anaesthesia than those who had not (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that drinking large volumes of clear apple juice 2.5 hours before scheduled surgery does not have a measurable effect on gastric volume and pH and may offer benefits such as improved patient comfort.\r"

  ".W": "Anaesthetists are responsible for the management of the airway in patients with unstable cervical spines. Unfortunately, the anaesthetic literature does not contain a recent, critical analysis of the current medical literature to aid anaesthetists attending such patients. This review is intended to serve such a purpose. Using the Index Medicus as a guide, 30 years of medical literature were reviewed, with emphasis on the last ten years. Key words employed for this review are cited in the manuscript. Relevant papers were selected from anaesthetic, orthopaedic, rheumatologic, emergency medicine and trauma journals and reviewed. Relevant findings included the high prevalence of cervical spinal instability in such disorders such as Trisomy 21 and rheumatoid arthritis and the relatively low incidence after trauma. There are deficiencies in the minimalist approaches to assessing the cervical spine, such as a simple cross table lateral radiograph after trauma, as they are neither sensitive nor specific. Finally, recognizing the potential for instability and intubating with care, while avoiding spinal movement, appears to be more important than any particular mode of intubation in preserving neurological function.\r"

Thus, because anaesthetic agents can affect cardiac function and may interact with concurrent antiarrhythmic medications, the anaesthetist should be aware of the electrophysiology associated with dysrhythmias and their management. Tocainide, flecainide, mexiletine, encainide and amiodarone have been introduced recently and each has an unique pattern of bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity. Patients treated with these drugs need special concern as they have abnormal cardiovascular systems and may be at increased risk for perioperative morbidity. In addition, unexpected untoward reactions and toxicity can result from interactions of anaesthetic agents and these drugs. This review discusses normal cardiac electrophysiology, common dysrhythmias and the electrophysiological effects of the newer oral antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

In this study, we examined the adrenergic influence on the secretion of angiotensins from BAECs. Angiotensins were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. At basal state, BAECs contain angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III at concentrations of 2.5 +/- 1.3, 4.8 +/- 2.3, and 3.4 +/- 1.5 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III concentrations in the culture medium were 8.3 +/- 4.4, 9.4 +/- 3.5, and 9.9 +/- 3.3 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Isoproterenol (0.1-10 microM) increases secretion of angiotensins I, II, and III in a dose-dependent manner. Increase in angiotensin secretion induced by isoproterenol (10 microM) can be inhibited by beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (1 microM), but not by beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1 microM). Forskolin (1-1,000 microM) mimics the isoproterenol-induced response. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) inhibits the secretion. Pretreatment of BAECs with captopril (1 microM) inhibits the accumulation of angiotensin II and angiotensin III in the culture medium, but not angiotensin I. These findings suggest that BAEC production and/or secretion of angiotensins is regulated by adrenergic mechanisms.\r"

Due to its pronounced vasoconstrictor activity, endothelin has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of vascular tone. We studied the effects of synthetic endothelin (0.1-10 nM) on coronary flow, mechanical performance, myocardial oxygen uptake, and formation of purines, and outflow of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (metabolite of prostacyclin) in rabbit hearts perfused with saline by the Langendorff method. Endothelin dose-dependently decreased the coronary flow, at 10 nM, by about 75%. Heart rate, ventricular contractility, myocardial oxygen uptake, and purine release were affected by endothelin no more than by a corresponding mechanical reduction of the coronary flow. In contrast, the diastolic relaxation appeared to be directly diminished by endothelin. The concentration of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha in the cardiac effluent was dose-dependently elevated by about 14 times by endothelin (10 nM) (p less than 0.001). A corresponding mechanical restriction of the coronary flow insignificantly affected the effluent concentration of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM) completely abolished the decrease in diastolic relaxation induced by endothelin and markedly counteracted the peptide-induced increase in effluent concentration of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, but did not affect the vasoconstrictor activity. These data demonstrate that endothelin induces vasoconstriction and facilitates the outflow of prostacyclin in the rabbit heart. In addition, the peptide appears to affect diastolic relaxation in this organ.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance of large arteries appears to be greater in the cerebral circulation than in other vascular beds. Large arteries contribute importantly to total cerebral vascular resistance and are major determinants of local microvascular pressure. Recent studies have shown that resistance of large arteries and cerebral microvascular pressure are affected by several physiological stimuli, including changes in systemic blood pressure, increases in cerebral metabolism, activity of sympathetic nerves, and humoral stimuli such as circulating vasopressin and angiotensin. Stimuli such as sympathetic stimulation and vasopressin produce selective responses of large arteries and, thereby, regulate microvascular pressure without a significant change in cerebral blood flow. These findings lead to the new hypothesis that the brain may be sensitive to changes in cerebral microvascular pressure, resulting in activation of compensatory neurohumoral mechanisms. Important changes occur in large cerebral arteries under pathophysiological conditions. Chronic hypertension increases resistance of large cerebral arteries, which protects the microcirculation against hypertension. Atherosclerosis potentiates constrictor responses of large cerebral arteries to serotonin and thromboxane, which may contribute to vasospasm and transient ischemic attacks.\r"

The limitations of these trials must be considered; however, if the trials are to provide useful information on the role of platelets in thrombotic processes. Difficulties arise because of the variable composition of emboli and the many possible causes of strokes. Some emboli are composed mainly of platelets while others consist of atheromatous material. Strokes may result from hemorrhage, hemodynamic disturbances, or lacunar infarction rather than thromboembolism. Nonetheless, the results of clinical trials suggest that at least some strokes can be prevented by antiplatelet drugs, thus implying that platelets are involved in the underlying disease process.\r"

The mitogen (platelet-derived growth factor) for smooth muscle cells that is released from platelets that adhere to the sites of injury contributes to vessel wall thickening, as does the organization of mural thrombi. Although many arterial thrombi result from fissure or rupture of the fibrous cap of lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques, thrombi that result from shear-induced platelet aggregation and disturbed blood flow at stenotic lesions also contribute to the thromboembolic clinical complications of atherosclerosis. Prevention of thrombus initiation requires a better understanding of platelet interaction with injured vessel walls and of the ways in which this process may be inhibited. A crucial factor in the management of thrombus formation in severely injured vessels is restoration of a normal pattern of blood flow. Theoretically, it may be possible to use angioplasty (to remove atherosclerotic lesions and to dilate stenosed vessels) and to use new therapeutic interventions (to prevent the accumulation of an initial layer of platelets on the acutely injured surface) to reduce the probability of restenosis and thrombosis at these sites.\r"

Various aspects of platelet interaction with the vessel wall can be used, as can some changes in levels of coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, and natural anticoagulants. All have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of having the attributes of the ideal marker that would identify the pathophysiological processes and be reproducible, inexpensive, and easy to perform. This review will consider the value of various clinical markers, taking account of their advantages and disadvantages.\r"

Consequently, inhibition of binding to these glycoproteins by monoclonal antibodies or synthetic peptides could provide a useful approach to the treatment of thrombotic conditions. Most of the studies that have used this approach have focused on glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, which is a multispecific receptor that binds von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin, all of which are involved in cell adhesion. In animal studies, monoclonal antibodies raised against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa cause an increase in bleeding time, indicative of impaired platelet function, and there is some evidence that these antibodies are more effective at reducing platelet adhesion than anticoagulants or thromboxane synthase inhibitors. Furthermore, as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa binds several proteins involved in cell adhesion, many of which bear the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, it may be possible to prevent thrombus formation by the use of synthetic peptides containing this sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Episodic platelet activation has been shown to occur in unstable angina, and aspirin should have an important therapeutic role in the management of these patients. The response to aspirin alone or to aspirin in combination with vasodilators such as heparin and beta-blockers has been assessed in 41 patients with unstable angina. Therapy was added sequentially in the event of recurrence of transient myocardial ischemia. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 (21 patients) received an intravenous infusion of isosorbide dinitrate and oral diltiazem, and group 2 (20 patients) received intravenous aspirin (60 mg the first day and 20 mg on successive days). This dose of aspirin reduced serum thromboxane B2 from 160 +/- 88 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) to undetectable values (less than 6 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). If episodes of ischemic ST segment shift continued, the therapy of group 1 was added to that of group 2 or vice versa; if further ST segment changes were documented, intravenous heparin and oral beta-blockers were added; if episodes of myocardial ischemia persisted, urgent coronary arteriography and myocardial revascularization were performed. Nine patients in group 1 and six in group 2 (p = 0.8) had no further episodes of myocardial ischemia on their initial therapy; 12 additional patients had no further episodes when taking combined therapy of aspirin and vasodilators. Thus, the administration of aspirin alone was not superior to coronary dilators; 30% of all patients continued to have episodes of myocardial ischemia or had a myocardial infarction develop when heparin and beta-blockers were added. Myocardial infarction occurred in one patient on vasodilator therapy alone, in two on combined therapy, and in two on full therapy. These results suggest that in some patients, the stimulus to coronary thrombosis and vasoconstriction occasionally becomes so strong that it cannot be inhibited by certain antagonist drugs. The unstable tendency to continuation of ischemia or evolution to myocardial infarction is not related to the severity of the persisting stenosis. Those patients not promptly responding to combined therapy immediately from admission should have early coronary angiography and aggressive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This review of the clinical studies of thromboxane synthase inhibitors (TXSIs) and thromboxane receptor blocking drugs (TXRBs) covers the years 1981 to the present. Clinical studies on TXSIs include those in normal volunteers as well as those in patients with angina, peripheral vascular disease and Raynaud's syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cerebral vasospasm, hepatorenal syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and those on cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis. The compounds studied include dazoxiben, dazmagrel, CGS 13080, CV 4151, OKY 1581, OKY 046, and U 63557A. In volunteers, single-dose studies have demonstrated inhibition of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation, with some small increases in bleeding time but no marked effect on platelet aggregation. In general, the compounds tested were ineffective in both chronic stable angina and vasospastic angina but caused symptomatic improvement in patients with unstable angina. The TXSIs studied were found to produce no consistent effects in any of the other clinical conditions. Since none of the compounds tested produced a sustained inhibition of TXA2 synthesis, the disappointing clinical results with this class of drugs may be due to an incomplete blockade of thromboxane synthase with the dosage regimens used. Possible alternative or additional reasons for the general lack of success with TXSIs could be that some of the diseases studied do not involve TXA2 or that accumulating prostaglandin endoperoxides in the presence of thromboxane synthase inhibition substitute for TXA2 in causing platelet aggregation. TXRBs rely for their efficacy only on blockade of the TXA2 receptor and antagonize the deleterious effects of both TXA2 and prostaglandin H2 equally, so they represent a simpler pharmacological approach than TXSIs. Such drugs include AH 23848, GR 32191, BM 13.177, BM 13.505, and SQ 28668. All of these compounds are inhibitors of platelet aggregation induced by TXA2 or by its stable mimetic, U-46619. AH 23848 was ineffective in patients with stable angina but did benefit patients with peripheral vascular disease. BM 13.177 has also proven effective in preventing restenosis after angioplasty, occlusion of coronary artery bypass grafts, and the deleterious effects of TXA2 in renal disease. From these preliminary studies, it would appear that TXRBs may offer greater clinical potential than TXSIs. Further studies currently underway with TXRBs to resolve this question include those in unstable angina, angioplasty, peripheral vascular disease, renovascular hypertension, and cyclosporine nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological requirements of performing exercise above the anaerobic threshold are considerably more demanding than for lower work rates. Lactic acidosis develops at a metabolic rate that is specific to the individual and the task being performed. Although numerous pyruvate-dependent mechanisms can lead to an elevated blood lactate, the increase in lactate during muscular exercise is accompanied by an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio (i.e., increased NADH/NAD ratio). This is typically caused by an inadequate O2 supply to the mitochondria. Thus, the anaerobic threshold can be considered to be an important assessment of the ability of the cardiovascular system to supply O2 at a rate adequate to prevent muscle anaerobiosis during exercise testing. In this paper, we demonstrate, with statistical justification, that the pattern of arterial lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio increase during exercise evidences threshold dynamics rather than the continuous exponential increase proposed by some investigators. The pattern of change in arterial bicarbonate (HCO3-) and pulmonary gas exchange supports this threshold concept. To estimate the anaerobic threshold by gas exchange methods, we measure CO2 output (VCO2) as a continuous function of O2 uptake (VO2) (V-slope analysis) as work rate is increased. The break-point in this plot reflects the obligate buffering of increasing lactic acid production by HCO3-. The anaerobic threshold measured by the V-slope analysis appears to be a sensitive index of the development of metabolic acidosis even in subjects in whom other gas exchange indexes are insensitive, owing to irregular breathing, reduced chemoreceptor sensitivity, impaired respiratory mechanics, or all of these occurrences.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure occurs when myocardial dysfunction is advanced. Although clinical manifestations and diminished functional capacity can be traced back to the poor cardiac contractile state, there are major modifying influences from a complex series of compensatory responses. These particularly involve the heart, vessels, kidneys, sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system, and other hormone systems. Functional capacity is, therefore, determined by the sum of the effects of the original cardiac insult and the effects, beneficial and adverse, of the secondary events. Functional capacity relates closely to prognosis only in the most severely disabled patients. The latter is mainly related to the extent of ventricular dysfunction, and there can be independent contributions from arrhythmias and sympathetic activity. Measures of resting parameters of cardiac contractility, hemodynamics, or neurohumoral responses are, therefore, of no value in predicting functional capacity but can be useful in examining outlook or examining mechanisms of disease and therapy. Exercise measurements are necessary because adequate resting performance can disguise major limitations in cardiac reserve. Measurement of functional capacity can be used to quantify the effects of therapy on daily living and to give an indication of the overall response of the body to major cardiac inadequacy. Limitation of exercise capacity, the earliest symptom of heart failure, can be quantified during a graded exercise test. Measurements of cardiac output and hemodynamic variables during exercise quantify the extent to which the cardiovascular system can increase performance to meet the demands of exercise. Work capacity and maximum oxygen capacity indicate the limits of physical performance, whereas determination of the anaerobic threshold indicates the highest level of exercise at which cardiorespiratory mechanisms are able to provide adequate oxygen supply to maintain aerobic metabolism in working skeletal muscle.\r"

At these early stages, HA is thought to organize the ECM into a hydrated, open lattice and thereby support cell movements. At later stages, when specialized tissues appear, hyaluronidase activity increases. A correlation between elevated hyaluronidase activity and deposition of cartilage-type ECM is now well established. Differentiation of cartilage may be accompanied by changes in molecular forms of HA; however, the synthesis of HA is not understood well enough to permit firm generalizations to be drawn. There is also a lack of evidence regarding specificity of the hyaluronidase that appears at the onset of chondrogenesis. Thus, while HA is a ubiquitous ECM component and its appearance has been well studied during embryogenesis, there remain large gaps in the present knowledge regarding the means by which HA interacts with embryonic cells, tissues, and other ECM components.\r"

Comparisons were then made between this series and those that used internal fixation and one-piece conventional prostheses. Immediate postoperative and long-term follow-up study results confirm findings of a previous smaller study. That previous study showed the bipolar prosthesis offered significant improvement over internal fixation in reducing morbidity and mortality. Additionally, it offered advantages over the one-piece prosthesis in terms of fit, decreased acetabular erosion, and improved function.\r"

To evaluate the effect of age on alpha 2-adrenoreceptor function, we studied 12 healthy elderly subjects and 12 healthy young volunteers and compared the decrease in plasma norepinephrine and blood pressure in response to increasing doses of orally administered clonidine. We found that, for the same plasma clonidine concentration, the blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentration fell equivalently in both groups. These data imply that the increased plasma norepinephrine and the elevated blood pressure in the healthy elderly population do not appear to be secondary to a decrease in alpha 2-adrenergic response to an agonist in the central nervous system.\r"

Extracellular fluid volume was determined from the disappearance curves of injected mannitol in the same subjects and the plasma volume was measured by the Evans Blue dye dilution technique. 3. In normal pregnancy capillary permeability was not altered from that of non-pregnant subjects. Although extracellular fluid volume and plasma volume were increased in normal pregnant compared with non-pregnant women, the distribution of fluid between plasma volume and interstitial fluid volume was unaltered. 4. Women with established pregnancy-induced hypertension had a more rapid Evans Blue disappearance rate and a lower plasma volume than normal pregnant women, independent of the presence of proteinuria. Maternal plasma volume correlated positively and significantly with fetal birth weight in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, emphasizing the important relationship between maternal plasma volume and fetal outcome. 5. The increased capillary permeability in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension was associated with a reduction in the plasma volume/interstitial fluid volume ratio but a normal extracellular fluid volume, suggesting that the reduced plasma volume did not result from sodium loss but rather from a redistribution of the total extracellular fluid volume. These changes did not differ significantly in subgroups with and without oedema.\r"

The haemodynamic and hormonal changes following glucose ingestion (1 g/kg) were determined before and after pretreatment with either placebo or the somatostatin analogue, octreotide (SMS 201-995, 50 micrograms subcutaneously), in seven patients with chronic autonomic failure. 2. In the placebo phase, after glucose, there was a marked and prolonged fall in blood pressure with no change in cardiac index and peripheral blood flow. Plasma insulin and neurotensin levels increased, whereas glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were unchanged. 3. Octreotide transiently raised blood pressure and prevented glucose-induced hypotension. There were no changes in cardiac index or peripheral blood flow. Plasma insulin and neurotensin levels did not rise. Plasma glucose levels increased more slowly but reached a similar level to the placebo phase. 4. We conclude that in autonomic failure patients, glucose-induced hypotension was not accompanied by changes in cardiac index or peripheral blood flow, indicating a lack of compensation to probable splanchnic vasodilatation. The hypotension was prevented by the peptide release inhibitor, octreotide, with no change in cardiac index or in peripheral blood flow, suggesting an effect on the splanchnic vasculature, probably through inhibiting release of vasodilatatory pancreatic and gut peptides.\r"

Relative levels of renin mRNA were increased in the kidney, liver, brain, adrenal and heart of the young SHR compared with the WKY. In the aorta, levels were similar in the two strains at 5 weeks. 3. In 12-week-old animals, while increased levels persisted in the liver, brain and adrenal of the SHR, the level in the kidney was now the same in the two strains and the levels in the heart and aorta were lower in the SHR compared with the WKY. 4. Renin mRNA levels in the kidneys of SHR and WKY were also compared by Northern blotting and confirmed the observations made with the ribonuclease-protection technique. 5. The findings indicate a widespread abnormality of renin gene expression in the SHR which is modulated in some tissues by the development of hypertension. 6. While the mechanism(s) for the abnormality remains to be determined, the increased renin mRNA levels in the SHR in several tissues concerned with blood pressure regulation suggests an important role for the renin-angiotensin system in the development and maintenance of hypertension. 7. However, the finding of increased renin mRNA in the liver also suggests abnormalities in other, as yet unknown, functions of the renin-angiotensin system in the SHR.\r"

  ".W": "1. The metabolic effects of insulin on human adipose tissue were studied by combining the euglycaemic clamp technique with measurement of arteriovenous differences across the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the anterior abdominal wall. 2. Eight normal subjects were studied after an overnight fast, and for 120 min during infusion of insulin (mean arterialized plasma insulin 50-55 m-units/l). 3. During the insulin infusion, the arterialized and abdominal venous levels of both non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol fell, and the arteriovenous differences for the release of these substances narrowed. The fractional rate of re-esterification of fatty acids was around 20% in the fasting state and increased to almost 100% during hyperinsulinaemia. 4. In the fasting state the uptake of glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate by adipose tissue could account for only 20% of the oxygen uptake. During insulin infusion, adipose tissue glucose uptake increased and could account for more than 100% of oxygen uptake, implying storage of glucose. 5. Net balances of different substrates across adipose tissue were examined by calculating fluxes in terms of microgram-atoms of carbon. In the fasting state adipose tissue was in marked negative carbon balance (because of the export of non-esterified fatty acids); during insulin infusion it just reached 'carbon balance'. These results were in contrast to those from a previous study of glucose ingestion, in which the adipose tissue showed marked positive carbon balance (net substrate deposition).\r"

Other problems of prematurity remain, although an improvement in respiratory care appears to simplify the care overall. Many practical aspects of the treatment of infants with surfactant must yet be evaluated. If surfactant therapy proves to be efficacious and safe, it may ultimately be a major advance in the care of premature infants with HMD.\r"

The application of intermittent positive pressure ventilation through a nasal mask (NPPV) is a simple, noninvasive method for the provision of chronic intermittent ventilatory support. We investigated the effects of NPPV on inspiratory muscle activity in three normal subjects and nine patients with acute or chronic ventilatory failure due to restrictive (four subjects) or obstructive (five subjects) respiratory disorders. NPPV resulted in reductions of phasic diaphragm electromyogram amplitude to 6.7 +/- 0.7 percent (mean +/- SEM) of values obtained during spontaneous breathing in the normal subjects, 6.4 +/- 3.2 percent in the restrictive group, and 8.3 +/- 5.1 percent in the obstructive group. Simultaneous decreases in activity of accessory respiratory muscles were observed. The reductions in inspiratory muscle activity were confirmed by the finding of positive intrathoracic pressure swings on inspiration in all subjects. With NPPV, oxygen saturation and PCO2 remained stable or improved as compared with values obtained during spontaneous breathing. These results indicate that NPPV can noninvasively provide ventilatory support while reducing inspiratory muscle energy expenditure in acute and chronic respiratory failure of diverse etiology. Long-term assisted ventilation with NPPV may be useful in improving ventilatory performance by resting the inspiratory muscles.\r"

Most cases of accidental exposure are preventable if proper precautions are taken; however, when cases arise, their presenting signs and symptoms are nonspecific and often lead to a misdiagnosis resembling a flu-like viral illness. As a result, the incidence of acute CO poisoning is underestimated. The effects of CO poisoning are due to tissue hypoxia, with the CNS and the heart being the most susceptible target organs due to their high oxygen needs. Prolonged hypoxia due to high CO levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest (or both) and a variety of neurologic sequelae. Treatment is directed toward the relief of tissue hypoxia and the removal of CO from the body. Severity of poisoning can be divided into three levels based on CO levels in the blood. Administration of normobaric 100 percent oxygen is the therapy of choice for most cases, while hyperbaric oxygen therapy is reserved for severe poisonings.\r"

In our series, 16 percent of patients undergoing thoracentesis for PE were asymptomatic and the spectrum of causes was similar to that for symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic PEs were evenly distributed among transudates, exudates and indeterminate effusions. More symptomatic (S) PE were exudates, although the difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.1). In comparison to SPE, APE were more often free flowing and small. In both groups, the four most common diagnoses were malignancy, CHF, parapneumonic and postoperative effusions accounting for greater than 70 percent of each group. Review of the literature demonstrated the following associations with APE: recent childbirth or abdominal surgery, benign asbestos effusion, uremia, malignancy, and tuberculosis. In the uncomplicated postpartum or postoperative setting or in patients with typical findings of left ventricular failure, observation without diagnostic studies is appropriate. In all other situations, APE should be evaluated in traditional fashion. If thoracentesis is non-diagnostic and the effusion is an exudate, closed pleural biopsy and less often, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, should follow. Once malignant or granulomatous pleuritis has been excluded, it may be appropriate to observe for a period of time before proceeding to more invasive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to identify predictors of long-term compliance with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), we reviewed the records of 125 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) referred to our center for nasal CPAP trials. Severity of sleep apnea, sleep staging, daytime hypersomnolence, effectiveness of nasal CPAP, previous palatal surgery, and adverse reactions were compared in compliant and noncompliant patients. Nineteen patients did not tolerate a nasal CPAP trial in the laboratory or refused home nasal CPAP therapy. Ten patients were unavailable for follow-up. Of the remaining 96 patients, 23 (24 percent) had discontinued therapy, while 73 (76 percent) were still using nasal CPAP at 14.5 +/- 10.7 months (mean +/- SD). There were no statistically significant differences between the compliant and noncompliant patients in baseline apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI), baseline sleep staging, AHI while receiving nasal CPAP, sleep staging while receiving nasal CPAP, or frequency of adverse reactions during therapy. Severe daytime sleepiness was present in 65 of the 73 compliant patients and in 12 of the 23 noncompliant patients (p less than 0.05). Ten of 43 in the compliant group had previous palatal surgery compared with ten of 23 noncompliant patients (p less than 0.05). Our data confirm earlier observations in smaller samples that compliant and noncompliant patients have equally severe sleep apnea and good initial responses to nasal CPAP. Long-term compliance with nasal CPAP may be associated with the severity of daytime hypersomnolence on presentation. Previous palatal surgery was more frequent in patients who did not tolerate long-term nasal CPAP therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Asthmatic patients hyperventilate during acute attacks, but controversy persists as to whether they breathe rapidly, deeply or both. We monitored respiratory rate under the three following conditions: (1) asthma treated in the emergency room; (2) airways obstruction provoked by methacholine inhalation; and (3) airways obstruction provoked by exercise. In 47 acutely ill asthmatic patients, respiratory rate was higher than in 42 nonasthmatic control patients in the emergency room. Pretreatment respiratory rate correlated with peak expiratory flow rate and forced expired volume in one second. In 17 asthmatic patients and 16 healthy volunteers, breathing pattern was monitored by respiratory inductance plethysmography. Methacholine inhalation and exercise provoked significant airways obstruction in asthmatic patients but not in control subjects. In asthmatic patients, minute ventilation and tidal volume increased above that of control subjects following methacholine and exercise, but the rate was no higher than in control subjects. We conclude that the respiratory rate is increased in naturally occurring asthma, but not when acute airways obstruction is induced transiently in the laboratory. In the former setting, the respiratory rate is correlated with spirometric measures of airflow obstruction, but the weakness of the correlation does not allow the respiratory rate to be used as a substitute for spirometry.\r"

Sensitivity was assessed in 28 patients with angiographically-proven coronary artery disease. Specificity was assessed in 25 patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease on the basis of Bayes' theorem. Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated that the peak exercise ejection was clearly superior to the PBV ratio in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The PBV ratio appears to be less useful for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease than the peak exercise ejection fraction.\r"

A total of 361 patients (180 to iodinated glycerol and 181 to placebo) who complained of cough and difficulty bringing up sputum entered the eight-week study. Evaluations were based upon eight primary symptom efficacy parameters (cough frequency, cough severity, chest discomfort, dyspnea, ease in bringing up sputum, patient and physician global assessments, and a derived patients' global assessment), and six secondary parameters (frequency of aerosol bronchodilator use, incidence and duration of acute exacerbations, frequency of concomitant medication use, incidences of adverse experiences and dropouts). Cough frequency, cough severity, chest discomfort, patients' ease in bringing up sputum, patients' overall condition, and a derived subject global assessment were significantly (p less than 0.05) improved by iodinated glycerol as compared with placebo within eight weeks of treatment. Dyspnea showed a trend toward improvement and the physicians' global evaluation showed no significant difference between groups. Similar findings were noted in a subgroup analysis of moderately-to-severely affected patients. The mean duration (days) of acute exacerbations and number of dropouts attributable to adverse experiences were significantly less (p less than 0.05) in the iodinated glycerol group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the crypts in hyperplastic polyps were longer and wider, containing more cells, their cell density was less, particularly in the serrated epithelium. In these crypts, both the tall and short epithelial cells contained cytoplasmic vacuoles, even in the surface epithelium. These cells exhibited increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen. The subepithelial collagen table was of similar thickness in the polyp and control colonic mucosa, but it extended down along the cryptal wall to a greater depth in the polyp. These and other data indicate an aberrant differentiation of cryptal epithelial cells in the polyp. On upward migration to the surface, these cells appeared to undergo an arrested maturational process. Hence, the hyperplastic polyp may be considered a disease of epithelial cell differentiation.\r"

Inhibitory alpha 2-adrenergic reflexes with peptidergic afferents contribute to postoperative ileus. Clinically, treatment of ileus centers around symptomatic relief with nasogastric suction. Trials of adrenergic blockade combined with cholinergic stimulation have met with limited success. Prokinetic drugs have not been proved effective in the treatment of this disorder. Two types of ileus exist: postoperative and paralytic. Postoperative ileus resolves spontaneously after two to three days, and probably reflects inhibition of colonic motility. Paralytic ileus is more severe, last more than three days, and seems to represent inhibition of small bowel activity. No discrete structural changes cause postoperative ileus and the role of peptidergic neuronal systems of the enteric nervous system has not been elucidated. Possible central or humoral mechanisms have not been studied extensively. The possible direct inhibition of enteric or spinal nerves by anesthetic agents not cleared from these tissues remains to be studied. Also in need of study is the potential alteration of neurotransmitter receptor activity within the enteric nervous plexus after manipulation of the bowel.\r"

Our three cases and review of the literature confirm that the clinical presentation and eventual evolution of small cell carcinomas of the esophagus appear to be basically similar to those of the far more frequently occurring squamous and glandular carcinomas. However, certain differences in age and sex distribution of cases should be noted. Although squamous cell carcinomas occur three to four times more commonly in males, the male-to-female ratio in SCC in 1.6. Squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus reach a peak in the fifth and sixth decades of life; SCC cases occur a decade later. All of our patients had history of heavy smoking more than 50 pack-years, a factor that has also been implicated in predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. History of smoking to this extent was also mentioned in three other patients. There are also some differences in the location of the tumor. SCC rarely occurs in the upper third of the esophagus. The most common location of this tumor is the lower third where APUD cells are most abundant. On the other hand, a majority of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus are localized to the middle third, the upper and lower third being involved in equal proportions of the cases. Despite the above reported differences in clinical symptoms and course of these two tumors, their gross appearance is similar. Mean survival of both diseases also seems to be similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study design was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of omeprazole and placebo using endoscopy to assess ulcer healing after two or four weeks of therapy. One hundred fifty-three patients with endoscopically documented active duodenal ulcer were studied. One hundred two patients received omeprazole and 51 received placebo. Patients in both groups were similar with regard to age, sex, duration of disease, initial ulcer size, smoking history, and alcohol use. A \"per protocol\" analysis of healing rates showed a significant advantage for omeprazole (P less than 0.01) at both week 2 (41% vs 13%) and week 4 (75% vs 27%). Concomitant factors (including smoking and ulcer size) did not alter the significance of the differences in healing rates between omeprazole and placebo. Complete relief of day and night pain was more often achieved (P less than 0.01) in the omeprazole group. \"All-patients treated\" analyses for healing and pain relief gave results similar to the respective \"per protocol\" analyses. Omeprazole was well tolerated; fewer patients had clinical and laboratory adverse experiences in the omeprazole group than in the placebo group. Fasting serum gastrin levels increased with omeprazole therapy (mean 34.9 to 73.5 pg/ml) but exceeded the normal range (greater than 150 pg/ml) in only 12.3% of patients. Two weeks after therapy was stopped, serum gastrin levels showed a decrease toward baseline but had not yet completely returned to pretreatment levels (mean 49.7 pg/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 75 patients with acute pancreatitis these complexes were immunologically determined daily in plasma during the first week of hospitalization. Patients were classified into three groups: mild pancreatitis (I, less than or equal to 1 complication, N = 34), severe pancreatitis (II, greater than or equal to 2 complications, N = 29), lethal outcome (III, N = 12). Initially, granulocyte elastase (mean +/- SEM) was lower in group I (348 +/- 39 micrograms/liter) as compared to groups II (897 +/- 183 micrograms/l) and III (799 +/- 244 micrograms/liter), P less than 0.001 for I vs II + III. Initial elastase concentrations greater than 400 micrograms/liter were consistent with a severe or fatal course of the disease but did not distinguish between severe and lethal pancreatitis. In patients with mild or severe disease, mean elastase concentrations decreased continuously during the following days (197 +/- 15 micrograms/liter in mild cases, 325 +/- 30 micrograms/liter in severe cases at day 7). In patients with lethal disease, however, mean elastase concentrations even increased at day 2 and remained higher than 700 micrograms/liter during the observation period. At days 1 and 2 the predictive value for severe or lethal disease of raised (greater than 400 micrograms/liter) elastase concentrations [positive predictive value (PPV) 82%, negative predictive value (NPV) 81%] was better than that of elevated (greater than 100 mg/liter) C-reactive protein (PPV 73%, NPV 73%), elevated (greater than 4.0 g/liter) alpha 1-antitrypsin (PPV 59%, NPV 50%), or decreased (less than 1.5 g/liter) alpha 2-macroglobulin (PPV 82%, NPV 67%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Figure 9 is an attempt to summate the influences of life-style on lipid parameters. Based on the work of Nikkila, it shows the source of the production of HDL and LDL, the factors that can affect these lipoprotein levels, and where in the cascade of lipoprotein metabolism these factors exert influence. The source of HDL production is the liver and the intestine. At this stage, diet, exercise, hormones, genetics, drugs, and certain disease states can affect HDL levels. Lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) esterifies HDL-free cholesterol in plasma, and HDL3 is formed that in turn is transformed to HDL2. At the same time, VLDL from the gut and the liver will be converted, under the influence of LPL, to HDL2 and LDL. Thus HDL2 is being formed by the breakdown of VLDL and from the transformation of HDL3 to HDL2. Insulin, exercise, alcohol, fats, drugs, and diet affect lipoprotein lipase and consequently influence levels of LDL and HDL2 indirectly. Progestogens increase and estrogens decrease hepatic endothelial lipase, thus affecting the HDL2 concentration. It is at this point that combination OCs influence HDL2. The balance between estrogen and progestogen in a given contraceptive determines the extent and direction of HDL2 concentration. A separate pathway in the liver also catabolizes HDL2 and HDL3. LDL is generated partly from catabolism of VLDL and is partly secreted from the liver. The removal of LDL is mediated by receptors in both the liver and peripheral tissues. It is here that the Brown-Goldstein theory plays a major role. If LDL receptors are present in an insufficient number or are defective, then the C will accumulate and atherosclerosis may follow. Thus two key enzymes, LCAT and LPL, control the production of HDL2 and LDL, whereas a third enzyme, hepatic endothelial lipase, catabolizes HDL2.\r"

  ".W": "Our experience in 242 consecutive ultrasound directed follicle aspirations using the perurethral technique is reported. The mean number of follicles punctured per patient was 9.6 (range 20 to 35), resulting in a mean oocyte yield of 6.1 (range 0 to 31) per patient. It was necessary to change to another ultrasound directed route in 20 patients, and we failed to retrieve oocytes in a further 6 patients. There were no serious complications. The fertilization and cleavage rates were 68% and 91%, respectively. Embryo transfer was performed in 178 cases, resulting in 39 clinical pregnancies (21.9%). Ultrasound directed follicle aspiration by the perurethral route is an efficient way of collecting oocytes and is acceptable to patients. There is no need for general anaesthesia, so this technique is well suited to in vitro fertilization programs based on outpatient procedures.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial in 248 patients with symptomatic duodenal ulcers [97% greater than 5 mm diameter], 126 were randomized to receive omeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning and 122 were randomized to receive ranitidine 300 mg once daily at night for 2 wk and if the ulcers were unhealed for a total of 4 wk. When ulcer healing was assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, 79% of those receiving omeprazole had healed ulcers after 2 wk compared with 62% of those receiving ranitidine (p less than 0.005; therapeutic gain for omeprazole, 18%; 95% confidence intervals, +6% to +29%). At 4 wk the figures were 91% (omeprazole) and 80% (ranitidine) (p less than 0.05). After 2 wk, 77% of omeprazole-treated and 59% of ranitidine-treated patients were free of ulcer pain (p = 0.005). Assessed by diary cards (successfully completed by 92% of patients), daytime pain resolved more quickly in omeprazole-treated patients than in those receiving ranitidine (p less than 0.01). Omeprazole-treated patients took fewer antacids (p less than 0.05) over the first 2 wk. Omeprazole, 20 mg each morning, provides more rapid relief of the symptoms of duodenal ulcer and heals a greater proportion of duodenal ulcers within 2 and 4 wk than ranitidine, 300 mg each night.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of different doses of somatostatin (36, 180, 360 pmol/kg/h) on the motor patterns of the duodenum and on gallbladder volume in the postprandial period were evaluated. Gallbladder volume and small intestinal motor activity were monitored simultaneously in 9 normal subjects. Gallbladder volume was measured every 5 min throughout the study by real-time ultrasonography while intestinal motility was recorded manometrically by means of a low-compliance pneumohydraulic system. On day 1, the response of the gallbladder to a 972-kcal test meal was evaluated ultrasonographically to assure a normal response. On day 2, at least 2 consecutive phase III complexes of the interdigestive motor cycle were recorded. Gallbladder volume varied cyclically during the interdigestive motor cycle, with the minimum value late in phase II and the maximum early in phase I (p less than 0.01); the test meal was then administered. Following the induction of a typical pattern of postprandial motility, somatostatin infusion was started and continued for 150 min. Somatostatin, at the 180- and 360-pmol/kg/h doses, interrupted the fed pattern and induced consecutive bursts of propagated clustered activity. The characteristics of these somatostatin-induced motor patterns were similar to the spontaneous phase III of the interdigestive motor cycle. An initial reduction in gallbladder volume cycle. An initial reduction in gallbladder volume followed the ingestion of the meal; during somatostatin infusion, gallbladder volume increased to values greater than fasting values and varied cyclically with minimum values before the second episode of propagated clustered activity. These results show that somatostatin interrupts the fed pattern and elicits consecutive clusters of propagated motor activity in the duodenum that are coordinated with cyclic fluctuations in gallbladder volume.\r"

  ".U": "90108551\r", 
  ".W": "The National Polyp Study (NPS), a randomized clinical trial to evaluate effective surveillance of patients discovered to have one or more colorectal adenomas, was the framework for this statistical analysis which used a multiple logistic model to assess the independent risk factors of patient and polyp characteristics associated with high-grade dysplasia in adenomas. The database included 3371 adenomas from 1867 patients. Adenoma size and the extent of the villous component were found to be the major independent polyp risk factors associated with high-grade dysplasia (p less than 0.0001). The adjusted odds ratios were 3.3 for medium-sized adenomas and 7.7 for large adenomas relative to small adenomas and 2.7 for villous A adenomas, 3.4 for villous B adenomas, and 8.1 for villous C and D adenomas relative to tubular adenomas. Increased frequency of high-grade dysplasia in adenomas located distal to the splenic flexure was attributable mainly to increased size and villous component rather than to location per se. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.4 (p less than 0.11) for left-sided location. Multiplicity of adenomas affected the risk for high-grade dysplasia in patients but was dependent on adenoma size and villous component and was not an independent factor. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.3 (p less than 0.17) for multiplicity. Increasing age was associated with risk for high-grade dysplasia in patients, and this effect was independent of the effect of adenoma size and histological type. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.8 (p less than 0.0016) for age greater than or equal to 60 yr. Gender was not associated with high-grade dysplasia. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.0 (p less than 0.95) for men. The size of the patient series, the prospective nature of the data collection, the completeness of information on all patients, the requirements of complete examination of the entire colon and pathological examination of all lesions encountered, and the exclusion of patients with previously diagnosed adenomas are, collectively, features unique to this study. The detailed model provided by the analysis integrates multiple patient and adenoma factors associated with high-grade dysplasia in colorectal adenomas.\r"

  ".W": "An immune-complex-mediated inflammation has been suggested in the pathogenesis of skin and biliary complications in ulcerative colitis, although specific antigen-antibody complexes have not been found. We recently identified an Mr 40,000 colonic protein that reacts with tissue-bound immunoglobulin G eluted from colon specimens of patients with ulcerative colitis and not with immunoglobulin G eluted from colon specimens of patients with other diseases (J Clin Invest 1985;7:311). Murine monoclonal antibodies to the purified Mr 40,000 colonic protein are developed. The presence of the Mr 40,000 protein was examined with a monoclonal antibody (7E12H12, immunoglobulin M isotype) by an immunoperoxidase assay against various human epithelial tissues (74 specimens) including colon, ileum, jejunum, duodenum, stomach, esophagus, pancreaas, liver, respiratory, urinary, and genital tracts. In addition, gall bladder, bile duct, hepatic ducts, skin, synovial membrane, and eye tissue were also examined for any cross-reactivity with 7E12H12 and another anti-Mr 40,000 monoclonal antibody (7E6A5, immunoglobulin G1 isotype). 7E12H12 reacted only with colonic-epithelial cells mainly along the basolateral domains of plasma membrane and apical areas. The reactivity was present in both adult and fetal colon including the appendix. Among all the noncolonic tissue specimens, 7E12H12 reacted only with the gall bladder, the bile duct, the hepatic ducts, and the skin. All other epithelial tissues from 15 different organs, including the small intestine, synovium, and eye tissue, did not react. In the skin and biliary tract the immunoreactivity was exclusively present in the epidermal epithelial cells and mucosal epithelium respectively. 7E6A5 stained colonic mucosal cells but did not react with skin, biliary epithelium, synoyium and eye tissue. These results indicate the presence of a unique epitope or epitopes on Mr 40,000 colonic epithelial protein that is shared by the skin and biliary tract epithelial cells. Future studies of this shared epitope or epitopes and its immune recognition may provide further understanding in the pathogenesis of extraintestinal complications involving these organs in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

Diagnosis is usually made under emergency conditions and is mainly based on ultrasound and computed tomography plus bolus injection and splenoportography. Additionally, ultrasound- or computed tomography-guided needle aspiration of fluid collection in the left upper quadrant may be helpful. Such conditions may be life threatening and, according to the increasing number of case reports, may be more frequent than is thought. They must be added to the list of other important extrapancreatitic complications such as shock and respiratory and renal failure. This review summarizes the present knowledge on splenic complications in acute and chronic pancreatitis for purposes of timely diagnosis and treatment and draws attention to the need for follow-up examinations of the spleen by imaging procedures in the course of acute and chronic pancreatitis.\r"

Its initial manifestations range from asymptomatic to nonspecific and include palpitations, fatigue, confusion, and even syncope and sudden death. Electrocardiographic evidence of SSS includes inappropriate sinus bradycardia, sinus pause or arrest, or sinus exit block. These bradyarrhythmias may alternate with tachyarrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, to create the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. The diagnosis of SSS may be established by electrocardiography or ambulatory monitoring in the majority of cases. Medications such as digoxin, beta-blockers, and calcium blockers may initiate or worsen the manifestations of SSS. Permanent pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. Progression of SSS is mostly dependent on the presence and severity of associated coronary or hypertensive heart disease.\r"

Unfortunately, the infrequency of abdominal pain and the frequent presence of serious concomitant diseases complicate both the diagnosis and management of peptic ulcers in the elderly. Ulcers heal equally when treated with H2-receptor antagonists, antacids, or sucralfate. Patients with a history of silent, complicated ulcers and patients with serious concomitant diseases require low-dose maintenance H2-blockers to prevent ulcer recurrence. The frequency of NSAID-related ulcers may be reduced in selected patients with misoprostol in the case of gastric ulcers, or misoprostol or H2-blockers in the case of duodenal ulcers. NSAID-related ulcers heal when treated with H2-blockers.\r"

  ".W": "Aberrant hepatic expression of HLA molecules has been shown to be present in primary biliary cirrhosis and may play a determining role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We have studied the effect of the long-term administration of ursodeoxycholic acid on hepatic HLA expression. Nine untreated patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, eight patients treated for at least a year with ursodeoxycholic acid and eight control subjects without hepatobiliary disease were compared. HLA expression was studied on liver biopsy sections using a direct immunofluorescence technique with specific monoclonal antibodies directed against class I or class II HLA molecules. Aberrant biliary HLA class II expression was not modified by chronic administration of ursodeoxycholic acid. In contrast, aberrant hepatocyte HLA class I expression was markedly reduced. Reduction in HLA class I expression may lead to decreased cytotoxic T cell-dependent lobular necrosis, which is thought to contribute to the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis to advanced stages. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis could result not only from a reduction in the intrahepatic accumulation of cytotoxic bile acids but also from a reduction in immunological injury.\r"

Serum laboratory findings included elevation of serum bilirubin and AST, prolongation of serum prothrombin time and a positive monospot. A tentative diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was made, and a healthy male infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. Over the subsequent 3 days, acute progressive oliguric renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypoglycemia requiring intravenous dextrose infusion and pancreatitis developed; her mental status progressed to stage III encephalopathy. Quantitative computed tomography estimated the liver volume to be 770 cm3. The decision to proceed with orthotopic liver transplantation was made on the basis of progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive support and because of her small liver size. After transplant, the patient's multisystem failure rapidly reversed. Histopathological examination of the native liver demonstrated predominantly zone 3 microvesicular steatosis with characteristic ultrastructural changes consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Southern blot analysis for Epstein-Barr virus DNA was negative. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation should be considered for the small group of patients with fulminant hepatic failure associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy who manifest signs of irreversible liver failure despite delivery of the fetus and aggresive supportive care.\r"

  ".U": "90109317\r", 
  ".W": "To study the metabolism and production of angiotensin I, highly purified monoiodinated [125I] angiotensin I was given by constant systemic intravenous infusion, either alone (n = 7) or combined with unlabeled angiotensin I (n = 5), to subjects with essential hypertension who were treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg b.i.d.). Blood samples were taken from the aorta and the renal, antecubital, femoral, and hepatic veins. [125I]Angiotensin I and angiotensin I were extracted from plasma, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and quantitated by gamma counting and radioimmunoassay. Plasma renin activity was measured at pH 7.4. The plasma decay curves after discontinuation of the infusions of [125I]angiotensin I and unlabeled angiotensin I were similar for the two peptides. The regional extraction ratio of [125I]angiotensin I was 47 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) across the forearm, 59 +/- 3% across the leg, 81 +/- 1% across the kidneys, and 96 +/- 1% across the hepatomesenteric vascular bed. These results were not different from those obtained for infused unlabeled angiotensin I. Despite the rapid removal of arterially delivered angiotensin I, no difference was found between the venous and arterial levels of endogenous angiotensin I across the various vascular beds, with the exception of the liver where angiotensin I in the vein was 50% lower than in the aorta. Thus, 50-90% of endogenous angiotensin I in the veins appeared to be derived from regional de novo production. The blood transit time is 0.1-0.2 minute in the limbs and in the kidneys and 0.3-0.5 minute in the hepatomesenteric vascular bed. This is too short for plasma renin activity to account for the measured de novo angiotensin I production. It was calculated that less than 20-30% in the limbs and in the kidneys and approximately 60% in the hepatomesenteric region of de novo-produced angiotensin I could be accounted for by circulating renin. These results indicate that a high percentage of plasma angiotensin I may be produced locally (i.e., not in circulating plasma).\r"

  ".U": "90109319\r", 
  ".W": "This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of converting enzyme inhibition on functional and structural vascular alterations in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and in normotensive rats. Starting 1 day before surgery, 100 mg/kg/day captopril was given chronically to half of the hypertensive and normotensive groups in their drinking water. With use of intravital microscopy in the cremaster muscle, arteriolar dimensions were measured 4 weeks later, both before and after topical application of 10(-3) M adenosine. Mean blood pressure was 124 +/- 4 mm Hg in control rats and 103 +/- 5 mm Hg in captopril-treated control rats (p less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure was significantly elevated to 183 +/- 5 mm Hg in captopril-treated one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and 193 +/- 5 mm Hg in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. With use of histological techniques, a marked reduction of medial-intimal area of the abdominal aorta was found in captopril-treated control rats (24%), and hypertrophy of the aortic wall in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats was decreased 26% by captopril. Structural diameter reductions occurred in large arterioles of the captopril-treated control and hypertensive groups and the nontreated hypertensive group. In spite of a significant increase in wall-to-lumen ratio of first-order arterioles in all captopril-treated rats, captopril decreased cross-sectional wall area of these vessels 37% in hypertensive and 20% in control rats, respectively. Measured by stereological techniques, small arteriolar density decreased 30% in captopril-treated hypertensive rats and 17% in captopril-treated control rats. Therefore, smaller arteriolar lumens, decreased aortic and arteriolar cross-sectional wall area, and arteriolar rarefaction after converting enzyme inhibition, in spite of rising or falling blood pressure, are evidence that vascular growth was inhibited in vivo.\r"

At a high concentration (1 microM), both angiotensin II and endothelin induced a biphasic formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol with an early transient phase and a late sustained phase. At this high concentration, angiotensin II caused a transient contraction followed by a gradual relaxation, whereas endothelin caused a slowly developing and sustained contraction. At a low concentration (EC50 for the early phase of 1,2-diacylglycerol formation), angiotensin II also induced a biphasic formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and caused a transient contraction, but endothelin induced a monophasic formation of 1,2-diacyglycerol with only an early peak. Despite a rapid decrease of 1,2-diacylglycerol, endothelin at this low concentration still caused a sustained contraction. At both the high and low concentrations, the 1,2-diacylglycerol level was sustained higher for angiotensin II, whereas the tension during the late tonic phase of contraction was greater for endothelin. These results suggest that the unique persistent nature of endothelin-induced contraction is not attributed simply to the stimulatory effect of this peptide on the 1,2-diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway.\r"

However, the combination of extremely small doses of local anesthetics and opiate drugs seems to provide excellent analgesia with a minimum of side effects. This concept of combined opiates and local anesthetics corresponds to that of modern \"balanced\" general anesthesia, in which small amounts of several drugs are used to provide excellent anesthesia with a minimum of the side effects seen with large doses of any single drug. In my opinion, this \"balanced\" regional anesthesia holds great promise for the future, especially with the discovery of new drugs that produce spinal analgesia through a variety of mechanisms. These drugs include catecholamines, clonidine, GABA agonists, substance P antagonists, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and many other drugs capable of altering neural transmission in such a way that analgesia results. Obviously, labor analgesia is one area in which these combinations will be explored extensively, and the next few years should be very exciting ones.\r"

  ".U": "90109370\r", 
  ".W": "Premature birth still accounts for about 75% of perinatal mortality. Although great strides have been made in the care of premature babies over the past two decades, markedly decreasing mortality, the prevention of premature birth has not been greatly improved. Although tocolysis, particularly with the beta-2 agonists and magnesium sulfate, may delay birth and allow fetal maturation, it poses several risks which, if not recognized, can cause serious morbidity and even mortality. The use of these drugs and other less widely used tocolytics has important implications for the anesthesiologist. The premature infant itself is subjected to such risks as RDS, IVH, NEC, asphyxia, hypothermia, increased incidence of breech presentation, metabolic disturbances, and predisposition for trauma. To ensure safe delivery, premature babies should be delivered in a tertiary care center equipped and ready to attend to their needs. Major conduction block, particularly continuous lumbar epidural analgesia, is an ideal form of analgesia for the delivery of most premature neonates. Properly administered, it maintains maternal physiology, is not associated with drug depression in the newborn, enables a controlled, atraumatic vaginal delivery, and has little interaction with tocolytics (and indeed may protect against some of their side effects). It is ideal for a trial of labor and, if initiated early, allows for an emergency cesarean section. Continuous lumbar epidural block and subarachnoid block are both superb for elective or urgent cesarean section. However, when their use is contraindicated, inhalation analgesia for vaginal delivery or general anesthesia for cesarean section can be safely administered from the standpoint of both mother and child. Expertly administered anesthesia is not a luxury but is indeed indispensable for successful premature delivery.\r"

Based on our knowledge of physical working requirements for astronauts during intra- and extravehicular activity and on the findings from bed-rest studies that utilized exercise training as a countermeasure for the reduction of aerobic power, deterioration of muscular strength and endurance, decrements in mood and cognitive performance, and possibly for bone loss, two exercise protocols are proposed. One assumes that, during microgravity, astronaut exercise physiological functions should be maintained at 100% of ground-based levels; the other assumes that maximal aerobic power in flight can be reduced by 10% of the ground-based level. A recommended prescription for in-flight prevention or partial suppression of calcium (bone) loss cannot be written until further research findings are obtained that elucidate the site, the magnitude, and the mechanism of the changes. Hopefully these proposed exercise prescriptions will stimulate further research and discussion resulting in even more efficient protocols that will help ensure the optimal health and well-being of our astronauts.\r"

Conscious rats were infused either with insulin or control vehicle (0, 0.47, 1.5, 4.7, 15.0 mU.kg-1.min-1) for 75 min before injection of hexamethonium. Compared with the control period, insulin infusion significantly increased MAP by 7.1 +/- 0.1, 12.7 +/- 2.0, and 19.7 +/- 0.3 (SE) mmHg and HR by 44 +/- 8.4, 66 +/- 10.3, and 95 +/- 6.3 beats/min, respectively, during the three highest rates of infusion. The dose-dependent increases in MAP and HR were due to increases in the activity of hexamethonium-sensitive pathways. In chemically sympathectomized rats, insulin infusion did not produce a significant increase in either MAP or HR. The influence of exogenous norepinephrine on MAP and HR was also studied after insulin infusion. Compared with the insulin-vehicle infusion, insulin infusion significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) the norepinephrine dose-response increase in MAP. In addition, isolated smooth muscle strips were studied to determine the influence of insulin on their in vitro responses to increasing doses of norepinephrine. Although insulin did not alter contractility, it significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased the sensitivity of the vascular strips to norepinephrine. Collectively, the data from these euglycemic experiments indicated that infusions of insulin caused increases in HR and MAP because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system, even though the responsiveness of the vascular smooth muscle was depressed.\r"

The dose of NKA required to decrease pulmonary conductance to 50% of its base-line value (ED50GL) was fivefold less (P less than 0.0001) in animals treated with thiorphan compared with controls. NKA1-8, a product resulting from cleavage of NKA by NEP, had no bronchoconstrictor activity. Similar results were obtained by using NKB as the bronchoconstricting agent. Captopril had no significant effect on airway responses to NKA or NKB. In contrast, both thiorphan and captopril decrease the ED50GL for substance P (SP). We also compared the relative bronchoconstrictor potency of NKA, NKB, and SP. In control animals, the rank order of ED50GL values was NKA much less than NKB = SP. NKA also caused a more prolonged bronchoconstriction than SP or NKB. Thiorphan had no effect on the rank order of bronchoconstrictor potency, but in animals treated with captopril, the rank order of ED50GL values was altered to NKA less than SP less than NKB. These results suggest that degradation of NKA and NKB by NEP but not by ACE is an important determinant of the bronchoconstriction induced by these peptides. The degradation by ACE of SP but not NKA or NKB influences the observed relative potency of the three tachykinins as bronchoactive agents.\r"

Administration of methacholine and substance P into the internal carotid artery via a retrograde cannulation of the lingual artery produced a dose-dependent increase in glandular output. The dose-response curve to methacholine was significantly shifted to the right by atropine. The secretory response to substance P was only partially inhibited by atropine at the dose that completely blocked secretion produced by methacholine (51 nmol/kg), suggesting the involvement of noncholinergic as well as cholinergic pathways. Phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase, significantly potentiated the action of substance P. The analyses of electrolyte contents in glandular secretion revealed the presence of Na+, K+, and Cl-. The sum of the electrolyte concentrations indicated that the secretion was close to isotonic. The anesthetized ferret is a useful in vivo model for the study of physiology and pathophysiology of nasal secretion.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to one of two prophylactic regimens: compression boots or aspirin. One hundred and nineteen patients completed the study. Seventy-two patients had unilateral arthroplasty and forty-seven, one-stage bilateral arthroplasty. In the unilateral group, the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was 22 per cent for the patients who used compression boots compared with 47 per cent for those who received aspirin (p less than 0.03). In the bilateral group, the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was 48 per cent for the patients who used compression boots compared with 68 per cent for those who received aspirin (p less than 0.20). The results confirm the effectiveness of compression boots in the treatment of patients who have had unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Despite the use of compression boots, however, patients who had bilateral arthroplasty were at greater risk for the development of deep-vein thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone (T3) has been shown to regulate the level of its receptor in a number of tissues and cell lines. Recently, proteins encoded by the protooncogene c-erbA have been identified as T3 receptors. In the rat, four c-erbA gene products have been isolated, three of which, r-erbA alpha-1, r-erbA beta-1, and r-erbA beta-2, encode biologically active T3 receptors; the fourth, r-erbA alpha-2, may play an inhibitory role in T3 action. The present work examines the molecular nature of T3 receptor autoregulation using probes specific for each c-erbA mRNA. Rats were rendered hypothyroid with propylthiouracil and then treated with either saline or T3. Northern blot analyses reveal marked tissue-specific and differential regulation of the multiple c-erbA mRNAs by T3. In the pituitary the levels of r-erbA beta-1 mRNA increase, whereas the levels of the pituitary-specific r-erbA beta-2 mRNA decrease with T3 treatment. In heart, kidney, liver, and brain the levels of r-erbA beta-1 are unaffected by thyroidal status. The levels of both r-erbA alpha mRNAs decrease with T3 treatment in all tissues examined except for the brain, where there is no change. In addition, we find that changes in the mRNAs encoding specific subpopulations of T3 receptors do not always parallel changes in total nuclear T3 binding. Differential regulation of the specific c-erbA mRNA species could have important consequences for T3 action.\r"

Pao changes and the recovery of offered peptide were significantly greater in NEP inhibitor-treated lungs than in control lungs. Captopril did not cause a significant change in the physiological effects or the recovery of SP and NKA. HPLC analysis of [3H]Pro2,4-SP and 125I-Histidyl1-NKA perfused through the airways showed major cleavage products consistent with NEP action. We conclude that there is significant degradation of both SP and NKA after tracheal infusion of peptides by NEP-like but not by ACE activity; this effect significantly influences the physiological effects of these peptides.\r"

Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for BCAA oxidation by muscle, is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Skeletal muscle BCKAD was only 2-4% active in control rats. Intravenous injection of Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (0.25-10 mg/kg) did not change total BCKAD activity, but increased the percent active enzyme in muscle three- to four-fold in 4-6 h. Identical results were observed in adrenalectomized rats pretreated with one dose of alpha-methylprednisolone (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) 30-60 min before saline or endotoxin injection, indicating that endotoxin's effect was not mediated by hypersecretion of adrenal hormones. Cortisone pretreatment of normal rats (100 mg/kg per d) for 2 d prevented endotoxin-induced activation of muscle BCKAD, suggesting that endogenous secretion products mediated BCKAD activation by endotoxin. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha and/or IL-1 beta or alpha (50 micrograms/kg) increased muscle BCKAD activation two- to fourfold in normal rats 4-6 h after intravenous injection. We conclude that cytokine-mediated activation of muscle BCKAD may contribute to accelerated BCAA oxidation in septicemia.\r"

  ".U": "90110488\r", 
  ".W": "L-arginine is required for the fungistatic action of murine macrophages in vitro. To further investigate this requirement, L-arginine metabolism by macrophages was measured under conditions where fungistasis either succeeded or failed. Macrophage fungistasis correlated with metabolism of L-arginine to citrulline, nitrite, and nitrate. The metabolic rate was dependent on extracellular L-arginine concentration, reaching a maximum of 67 nmol nitrite/h per mg protein. It accounted for one-third of arginine consumed by fungistatic macrophages. Equimolar amounts of citrulline and total nitrite plus nitrate accumulated in medium. This was consistent with the hypothesis that one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of L-arginine was oxidized to both nitrite and nitrate leaving L-citrulline as the amino acid reaction product. The analogue, NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine, selectively inhibited nitrogen oxidation and it was shown previously that it inhibited fungistatic capability. Resident macrophages were not fungistatic and their nitrogen oxidation was low. Once macrophages began producing nitrite/nitrate, protein synthesis was not required during the next 8 h for either fungistasis or nitrogen oxidation. Two-thirds of L-arginine consumption was due to macrophage arginase yielding L-ornithine and urea, which accumulated in medium. This activity was dissociated from macrophage fungistasis. Nitrogen oxidation metabolism by macrophages is linked to a mechanism that inhibits proliferation of fungi. This may involve synthesis of an intermediate compound(s) that has antimicrobial properties.\r"

Treated cells were cultured in semisolid medium under conditions designed to favor the growth of specific progenitor cell types. Compared with untreated controls, granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CFU-derived colonies decreased 77% when driven by recombinant human (rH) IL-3, and 85% when stimulated by rH GM colony-stimulating factor (CSF); erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E)- and CFU-E-derived colonies decreased 48 and 78%, respectively. In contrast, numbers of G-CSF-stimulated granulocyte colonies derived from antisense treated MNC were unchanged from controls, though the numbers of cells composing these colonies decreased approximately 90%. Similar results were obtained when MY10+ cells were exposed to c-myb antisense oligomers. When compared with untreated controls, numbers of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies derived from MY10+ cells were unchanged, but the numbers of cells composing these colonies were reduced approximately 75 and greater than 90%, respectively, in comparison with controls. c-myc sense and antisense oligomers were without significant effect in these assays. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, c-myb mRNA was detected in developing hematopoietic cells on days 0-8. At day 14 c-myb expression was no longer detectable using this technique. These results suggest that c-myb is required for proliferation of intermediate-late myeloid and erythroid progenitors, but is less important for lineage commitment and early progenitor cell amplification.\r"

We investigated the initial interaction of BCG with the bladder mucosa to determine whether binding was essential for the development of antitumor activity. Herein, we show that bladder urothelial disruption induced by acrolein, adriamycin, or electrocautery resulted in BCG binding in areas of urothelial damage. Binding induced by each method was inhibited by anti-fibronectin (FN) antibodies but not by antibodies to the basement membrane component laminin. Intravesical BCG binding also was inhibited by pretreating BCG with soluble FN. Inhibition of intravesical FN-mediated BCG attachment prevented immunization via the intravesical route. Moreover, the expression of both delayed hypersensitivity in the bladder of BCG-immunized mice and antitumor activity was inhibited by blocking FN-mediated intravesical BCG attachment. These data suggest that intralumenal attachment of BCG appears to be mediated by FN. Moreover, these data suggest that intravesical FN mediated attachment of BCG is a requisite step in BCG-mediated antitumor activity in the murine bladder tumor model.\r"

  ".W": "Generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GTHR) is a disorder of thyroid hormone action that we have previously shown to be tightly linked to one of the two thyroid hormone receptor genes, c-erbA beta, in a single kindred, A. We now show that in two other kindreds, B and D, with differing phenotypes, there is also linkage between c-erbA beta and GTHR. The combined maximum logarithm of the odds score for all three kindreds at a recombination fraction of 0 was 5.77. In vivo studies had shown a triiodothyronine (T3)-binding affinity abnormality in nuclear receptors of kindred A, and we therefore investigated the defect in c-erbA beta in this kindred by sequencing a major portion of the T3-binding domain in the 3'-region of fibroblast c-erbA beta cDNA and leukocyte c-erbA beta genomic DNA. A base substitution, cytosine to adenine, was found at cDNA position 1643 which altered the proline codon at position 448 to a histidine. By allelic-specific hybridization, this base substitution was found in only one allele of seven affected members, and not found in 10 unaffected members of kindred A, as expected for a dominant disease. Also, this altered base was not found in kindreds B or D, or in 92 random c-erbA beta alleles. These results and the fact that the mutation is predicted to alter the secondary structure of the crucial T3-binding domain of the c-erbA beta receptor suggest this mutation is an excellent candidate for the genetic cause of GTHR in kindred A. Different mutations in the c-erbA beta gene are likely responsible for the variant phenotypes of thyroid hormone resistance in kindreds B and D.\r"

Clear-cut, unequivocal, unambiguous, stop-smoking advice can produce sustained, 1-year abstinence rates in the 5% range. This capability has been clearly documented for physicians. Dental literature increasingly supports the same conclusion for dentists. These studies show that although the yield from such brief advice may seem small, it is 17 times greater than the yield which results from saying nothing. Moreover, because dentists and physicians see so many patients during the course of 1 year, the potential impact of such intervention is staggering. More than 3.5 million patients could be cured of tobacco dependence annually. While specialized smoking cessation treatment programs can achieve 1 year sustained abstinence rates as high as 70%, they reach relatively few patients and can only achieve such high success rates because of the intensive, time-consuming nature of their interventions. The impact of basic dental advice can be increased during regular follow-up visits, when \"teachable moments\" in dental health often occur. Impact of advice on the 1-year sustained abstinence rates can be increased by arranging to see the patient at regular follow-up visits after the target quit date has been set, making certain that the medication, nicotine polacrilex, is used correctly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In summary, the entrance of the dental community into this area of treatment may have a significant impact on the reduction of smoking in our society. Dentists may be seeing smokers before the onset of disease and when they are ready to quit. Repeated patient visits offer a unique opportunity for follow-up. Presently, nicotine polacrilex is the only approved pharmacological FDA treatment. This is an ideal treatment for dentists to pursue because it is orally administered and effective through a proper chewing action. Other pharmacological agents (for example, antihypertensives) may require the followup of the physician. There are three key demands on the practitioner treating smokers: an understanding of the role of nicotine dependence in compulsive smoking; how to prescribe and educate in the proper use of nicotine polacrilex; and sympathy and a basic awareness of withdrawal and the psychological needs of patients undergoing cessation from smoking. This paper covers the rationale for development and use of nicotine polacrilex as well as some of the evidence for its effectiveness (relief of nicotine withdrawal) and efficacy (short and long term). The specifics of proper use have been described along with a brief overview of the psychosocial skills needed to succeed. The dentist offers a unique opportunity to reach enormous numbers of smokers in the battle against tobacco-induced disease and death.\r"

Randomized controlled clinical trials provide the most solid basis for the establishment of broad therapeutic principles. Because randomized studies cannot be performed to address every question, observational studies will continue to play a complementary role in the evaluation of therapy. Randomized studies in progress, meta analyses of existing data, and increased use of administrative and collaborative clinical data bases will improve the knowledge base for decision making in the future.\r"

  ".W": "The perioperative consequences of preoperative aspirin administration were assessed in a large prospective cooperative study of 772 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The 772 patients were randomized to receive either aspirin (325 mg once a day), aspirin (325 mg three times a day), aspirin plus dipyridamole (325 and 75 mg together three times a day) (aspirin group), sulfinpyrazone (267 mg three times a day) or placebo (nonaspirin group). The therapy, except in the aspirin group, was started 48 h before the operation. In all aspirin subgroups, one 325 mg aspirin dose was given 12 h before surgery and maintained thereafter according to the assigned regimen. Patients in the aspirin group had significantly more postoperative bleeding and received more packed blood cells and blood products than did patients in the nonaspirin group. Although total operative duration and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were not different, the interval between completion of cardiopulmonary bypass and wound closure was significantly longer (p = 0.035) in the aspirin group. Thirty-one (6.6%) of 471 patients in the aspirin group and 5 (1.7%) of 301 patients in the nonaspirin group also required reoperation for control of postoperative bleeding (p = 0.002). The site of bleeding found at reoperation was not different between the two groups. There was no difference in operative mortality rates, incidence of other bleeding complications or occurrence of other post-operative complications between the two groups. Thus, antiplatelet regimens involving preoperative initiation of aspirin therapy, which has been shown to improve graft patency, increase the risk of abnormal postoperative bleeding and the need for reoperation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To prevent possible hemodynamic collapse after balloon occlusion or acute vessel closure in such high risk patients, a cardiopulmonary bypass system capable of providing up to 6 liters/min output was employed prophylactically. This technique, termed supported angioplasty, results in reductions of preload and afterload and allows prolonged balloon inflations in critical coronary vessels. A National Registry of 14 centers performing elective supported angioplasty was formed to collate the initial experience with high risk patients. Suggested indications were ejection fraction less than 25% or a target vessel supplying more than half the myocardium, or both. During 1988, the data from 105 patients (mean age 62 years) undergoing supported angioplasty were entered into the Registry. This group included 20 patients whose disease was deemed too severe to permit bypass surgery and 30 patients who had dilation of their only patent coronary vessel. Seventeen patients had stenosis of the left main coronary artery and 15 underwent dilation of that vessel. Chest pain and electrocardiographic changes occurred uncommonly despite prolonged balloon inflations. During the trial, there was a progressive change from cutdown insertion to percutaneous insertion of the circulatory support cannulas. The angioplasty success rate was 95% for the 105 patients, who underwent an average of 1.7 dilations per patient. Morbidity was frequent (41 patients), in most cases due to arterial, venous or nerve injury associated with cannula insertion or removal, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline characteristics including several measures of left atrial enlargement were compared for 31 patients who developed systemic embolism and 366 who did not develop embolism during a 5 year follow-up period. Variables that were significantly related to left atrial dimension or systemic embolization in univariate analyses were included with several others in a multiple logistic regression model. The incidence rate of systemic embolism was more than three times higher after mitral valve replacement than after aortic valve replacement (4.4 and 1.3 per 100 patient-years, respectively); this difference persisted after adjustment for other factors. Univariate analysis indicated a threefold higher incidence of systemic embolism in patients with a left atrial dimension greater than or equal to 4 cm compared with that in patients with a dimension less than 4 cm (3 versus 1 per 100 patient-years, respectively). However, when the effect of valve location (mitral versus aortic) was taken into account using either univariate or multivariate techniques, left atrial dimension was found not to be associated with systemic embolism. In multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation, age, ejection fraction and location of the prosthetic valve were significantly associated with embolism. Results of this multicenter study suggest that left atrial dimension is not independently related to the development of systemic embolism in patients undergoing valve replacement.\r"

Eligible subjects were postmenopausal women with stage II breast cancer whose baseline fat intake was more than 30% of energy intake. The low-fat diet intervention protocol consisted of bi-weekly individual counseling sessions with emphasis on substitution of lower-fat foods for high-fat foods and maintenance of nutritional adequacy. Nutrient intakes were calculated from 4-day food records collected at baseline and after 3 months of diet intervention. Mean daily fat intake for the 17 patients on the low-fat diet dropped significantly from 38.4 +/- 4.3% of energy intake at baseline to 22.8 +/- 7.8% at 3 months (p less than .001). A 25% reduction in mean energy intake, from 1,840 +/- 419 kcal at baseline to 1,365 +/- 291 kcal at 3 months, was accompanied by significant increases in protein and carbohydrate as percent of energy intake. A mean weight loss of 2.8 kg and a 7.7% reduction in serum cholesterol were observed; both changes were significant at the p less than .01 level. Absolute intakes of zinc and magnesium were significantly reduced. However, mean intake on the low-fat diet for 14 vitamins and minerals, including zinc and magnesium, exceeded two-thirds of the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). When expressed as nutrient density (i.e., amount of nutrient per 1,000 kcal), increases were observed for all micronutrients. These results support the hypothesis that a nutritionally adequate low-fat diet can be successfully implemented in a highly motivated, free-living population.\r"

The dietary treatments were reduction of sodium intake, increase of potassium intake, and decrease of energy intake. Estimates of changes in food intake were made by comparing 24-hour food records of the treatment and control participants. The participants in the treatment groups reported sodium intakes that were 30% to 40% lower than those of the controls. The restriction was achieved mainly by reducing intake of salt, meats, and grain products. Meats and grain products were still a major source of total sodium intake after treatment (41% to 47%), perhaps because of continued use of processed foods. Potassium intake was reported to be 16% to 25% higher in the treatment groups than in the controls, the increase achieved largely through increased consumption of fruits, with a lesser contribution from vegetables. Participants with higher initial body weights reported smaller increases in fruit and vegetable consumption than participants of normal weight, perhaps because of concerns about weight gain. Energy intake in the weight loss groups was 8% to 11% less than that of the controls. Men reported success in restricting calories from meats, dairy products, fats, beverages, and sugars.

The beef industry has responded by physically removing much of the adipose tissue from retail products and by initiating attempts to produce--genetically and environmentally--cattle with more muscle, less external fat, and less seam fat, without sacrificing the quality dependent on the amount of marbling present. Offering lean beef that is closely or completely trimmed of external fat has improved retail beef sales. Impetus for modification of the lipid composition of bovine muscle and adipose tissue, including marbling, has resulted from the following: (a) diet/health concerns of consumers and demands for leaner beef, (b) research clarifying effects of dietary fatty acids and cholesterol on serum cholesterol levels, (c) dietary guidelines and recommendations from health organizations, and (d) dietary recommendations by physicians and dietitians to reduce beef consumption. Analysis of cholesterol content of marbling dissected from the rib (longissimus dorsi) muscle revealed that marbling contributes little to total cholesterol content. Cholesterol content of marbling was 117 mg/100 gm intramuscular adipose tissue (equivalent to about a 2 mg cholesterol contribution to a 100-gm serving of uncooked meat). The difference in fatty acid composition of lean meat and of adipose tissue is primarily in the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is higher in lean meat. The most prevalent fatty acids in adipose tissue including marbling were: palmitic acid (24.1%), stearic acid (13.5%), and oleic acid (37.7%).\r"

We studied the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, in 20 patients aged 65 to 75 years with clinical evidence of atheromatous disease. After four weeks of treatment, there was a 29% fall in LDL-cholesterol levels (P less than .01 vs placebo) with low dose simvastatin and a 38% fall with high dose simvastatin (P less than .001 vs placebo). Similar falls were seen in total cholesterol levels and the LDL/HDL-cholesterol and total/HDL-cholesterol ratios. Apoprotein B levels decreased by approximately 20% with both doses (P less than .05 vs placebo). In an open extension of the study, the decreases in lipid parameters were sustained for a further 48 weeks of treatment with doses of simvastatin ranging from 10 to 40 mg. Two patients required the addition of cholestyramine. Although a small study like this cannot establish safety and tolerance, side effects were minor and did not require stopping therapy in any patient. Simvastatin is an effective cholesterol lowering agent in older patients.\r"

Compared to 41 controls, the 38 patients whose physicians were informed of the recommended changes demonstrated a small but significant reduction in the mean number of drugs, the complexity, and the cost of their regimens. Physicians complied with eight (100%) of eight recommendations to simplify a dosage schedule, eight (62%) of 13 recommendations to substitute a new drug for the old one, and only eight (40%) of 20 recommendations to stop a medication (P = .04). Noncompliance usually resulted from patient refusal or from medications being prescribed by another provider. Whereas feedback to the primary physician is beneficial, more substantial reductions in outpatient polypharmacy may require overcoming patient barriers and limiting the number of prescribing physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Nursing homes are becoming increasingly involved with medical education, and the Veterans Administration (VA) has been particularly active in this movement. We conducted a system-wide survey of VA nursing home facilities to determine the degree to which they participate in medical and other professional training and the features associated with such training. Of the 116 VA nursing homes in 1987, 113 (97.4%) returned completed questionnaires. Compared to \"standard\" VA facilities (n = 85), \"teaching\" nursing homes (n = 28)--those in which physicians received at least 20 hours of training per capita annually--were significantly larger, admitted and discharged significantly more patients per occupied bed, and placed a significantly larger proportion of discharged patients in noninstitutional community settings. Care costs in the teaching nursing homes were slightly but not significantly higher, despite significant increases in levels of professional staffing and amounts of training activities in all disciplines. During the survey year, teaching nursing homes provided training experiences for 440 students, residents, and fellows in internal and rehabilitation medicine, as well as for 2,700 other health professionals. The growth of teaching nursing homes in the VA system appears to be associated with positive changes in the pattern of health-care delivery, and it is increasing the number of health-care professionals trained in long-term care.\r"

The result is early derepression of this second locus, leading to reduced initiation of DNA synthesis and premature replicative senescence. This hypothesis and its corollaries provide a heuristic model for decisive experiments.\r"

The procedure allowed the bulk preparation of cells of any desired age up to at least 20 generations with minimum yields of 10(8) cells per preparation, starting with 6 X 10(9) 0-generation cells. The purity of the preparations was greater than 90%, with an accuracy of +/- 2 generations. The procedure itself had no detrimental effects on the cells, as indicated by a number of physiological parameters. Cell viability and resistance to sonication remained essentially unchanged during aging. In contrast, cell size and generation time increased, providing biomarkers for the aging process. The procedure described here should help establish yeast as a useful model system for studies of cellular aging at the molecular level.\r"
