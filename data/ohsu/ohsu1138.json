These polyspecific antibodies recognize pyruvate carboxylase enzymes alone without cross reactivity with other carboxylases as detected by immunoblotting. The abundance of pyruvate carboxylase in the various renal fractions was measured by ELISA and its activity by the fixation of [14C]CO3H-. The results were corroborated by a combination of immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. A good correlation was found between the enzymatic activity and the quantity of enzyme contained in each fraction. The kidney-cortex pyruvate carboxylase was primarily located in proximal tubules, in accord with its important role in gluconeogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "A cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line has been developed from a mouse transgenic for the early region of simian virus 40, Tg(SV40E)Bri/7. CCDs were microdissected and placed on collagen gels. Monolayers were subsequently subcultured onto permeable collagen membranes and maintained in serum-supplemented medium. One line, designated M-1, retained many characteristics of the CCD, including a typical epithelial appearance and CCD-specific antigens. M-1 cells, when grown in monolayers on permeable supports, exhibited a high transepithelial resistance (885.7 +/- 109.6 ohms/cm2) and developed a lumen negative transepithelial potential difference (PD) of -45.7 +/- 3.5 mV. The associated short-circuit current (SCC) averaged 71.8 +/- 10.3 microA/cm2, and was reduced by 95% by luminal application of amiloride. The cultured cells responded to arginine vasopressin (AVP) with a significant increase in SCC. M-1 cells generated significant transepithelial solute gradients. After 24 hours incubation, the composition of the luminal (L) and basolateral (B) media (in mM) was: [Na+], L = 106.7 +/- 0.9 and B = 127.4 +/- 0.4; [K+], L = 8.6 +/- 0.6 and B = 2.1 +/- 0.3; [Cl], L = 68.6 +/- 5.8 and B = 101.8 +/- 6.6; [HCO3], L = 15.5 +/- 1.5 and B = 8.6 +/- 1.2; while pH was 7.16 +/- 0.03 at the luminal and 6.94 +/- 0.03 at the basolateral side. The formation of these concentration gradients indicates that the CCD cultures absorb Na+ and Cl- and secrete K+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To accomplish this task, male Wistar rats were chronically cannulated in the bladder, femoral artery and vein. Control measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), extracellular fluid volume (ECF), and urinary sodium excretion were performed on two separate days prior to infusion of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body wt i.v.). After infusion of streptozotocin, the IDDM rats were separated into two groups: untreated IDDM group of rats and IDDM rats treated with insulin at doses sufficient to normalize blood glucose (Ultralente, 2 to 8 IU/day). A third group of normal non-diabetic rats served as time controls. Measurements of renal function occurred at 1, 4, 7, 11, and 15 days after infusion of streptozotocin. Blood glucose in the non-diabetic measurement period averaged 137 +/- 30 mg/dl and increased from 412 +/- 55 after 24 hours in the untreated diabetic rats to 533 +/- 33 mg/dl after 15 days of IDDM. The time controls and the insulin-treated diabetic rats did not differ in blood glucose values at the time measurements were performed. Glomerular filtration rate increased from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 ml/min/100 g body wt by day 15 in the untreated diabetic rats with significant increases in GFR within 24 hours. GFR of both time controls and the insulin-treated IDDM rats did not significantly vary during the time of the study. The increase in GFR in the untreated IDDM group was associated with a concomitant increase in RPF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After two weeks of salt loading, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly exacerbated and plasma volume (PV) was expanded in salt-loaded SHR compared with those in control SHR (SBP: 182 +/- 1 vs. 159 +/- 2 mm Hg; PV: 4.38 +/- 0.06 vs. 4.04 +/- 0.03 ml/100 g body wt, respectively). Plasma volume of WKY was also but only transiently expanded by salt loading, whereas plasma volume expansion in SHR had persisted over the entire dietary treatment period. TGF activity was assessed as the maximal reduction of single nephron GFR (SNGFR) on increasing loop of Henle perfusion rate from 0 to 40 nl/min using previously collected tubular fluid from salt-loaded rats (TFs) or control rats (TFc). Maximal TGF response in salt-loaded SHR with TFs was 14.9 +/- 2.9% and 57.8 +/- 2.6% with TFc. In control SHR the responses were 16.9 +/- 2.5% with TFs and 52.7 +/- 2.9% with TFc. In salt-loaded WKY the response with TFs were 3.1 +/- 1.6% and 37.4 +/- 2.8% with TFc. And in control WKY, the response with TFs were 8.2 +/- 1.9% and 40.8 +/- 2.8% with TFc, respectively. These results indicate the TGF resetting in chronically salt-loaded SHR and WKY is caused by the activation of humoral TGF inhibitory factor. The suppression of TGF in SHR was, however, far more variable and, on average, less than in WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For four days they were put on a diet restricted in calcium (Ca RD) by exclusion of the dairy products. They collected 24 hour urines on free diet and on day 4 of Ca RD as well as the two-hour fasting urines on the morning of the day 5 and the four-hour urines passed after an oral calcium load of 1 g, for measurement of creatinine, Ca, PO4, urea and total hydroxyprolinuria (THP). On day 5 fasting plasma concentrations of Ca, PO4, intact PTH, Gla protein, calcidiol and calcitriol were measured. The patients were firstly classified into dietary hypercalciuria (DH, 18 patients) and dietary calcium-independent hypercalciuria (IH, 24 patients) on the basis of the disappearance or not of hypercalciuria on Ca RD. Then the patients with IH were subclassified into absorptive hypercalciuria (AH) because of normal fasting calciuria (8 patients) and into fasting hypercalciuria (16 patients). Fasting hypercalciuric patients were subsequently divided according to the PTH levels into renal hypercalciuria (RH, 1 patient) with elevated fasting PTH becoming normal after the Ca load and undetermined hypercalciuria (UH, 15 patients) with normal PTH levels. Furthermore, their vertebral mineral density (VMD) was measured by quantitative computerized tomography which was normal in DH (91 +/- 6% of the normal mean for age and sex) but was decreased in IH to 69 +/- 4%. No difference in VMD was observed between AH and UH. Urinary excretions of urea, phosphate and THP was higher in IH than in DH and comparable in AH and UH. Sodium excretion Ca RD was the same in all groups and subgroups as well as the plasma parameters. Plasma calcitriol was increased in IH and DH comparatively to normal in spite of normal plasma calcidiol. Calciuria increase after oral calcium load, an index of Ca absorption, was higher in IH than in controls and comparable in IH and DH as well as in the three subgroups of IH. From these data and correlation studies in IH it is concluded: (1.) VMD is decreased in Ca stone formers with IH but not in those with DH, making the distinction of these two groups of hypercalciuria patients clinically relevant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In animals, secretion of potassium (K) in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) is modulated by the properties of the accompanying anion. In humans, results are inconclusive as previous studies have not differentiated between a kaliuresis due to a rise in the concentration of K from one due to an increase in the volume of urine. Our purpose was to study the effects of chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate on the secretion of K in the CCD in humans using the transtubular K concentration gradient (TTKG), a semi-quantitative index of secretion of K in the terminal CCD. After control blood and urine samples were obtained, all subjects ingested 0.2 mg fludrocortisone to ensure that mineralocorticoids were not limiting the secretion of K. The anionic composition of the urine was varied using three protocols: Normal subjects (N = 11) ingested cystine and methionine to induce sulfaturia; nine subjects with a contracted ECF volume (to lower the concentration of Cl in the urine) were also studied during sulfaturia following the ingestion of cystine and methionine; 13 normovolemic subjects were studied during bicarbonaturia following the ingestion of acetazolamide. When the concentration of Cl in the urine was greater than 15 mmol/liter, sulfate had no effect on the TTKG. With lower concentrations of Cl in the urine, the TTKG rose 1.5-fold. The TTKG rose 1.8-fold in the presence of bicarbonaturia despite concentrations of Cl in the urine that were greater than 15 mmol/liter, suggesting that bicarbonate has additional effects on this K secretory process. At comparable concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate in the urine, the TTKG was increased only with bicarbonaturia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) varies among racial groups, being most common among Caucasians and Orientals and rare in Blacks. Other investigators have hypothesized that the risk for IgAN may be influenced by the IgA2 allotype. It has been suggested that the rare Black patients with IgAN may be homozygous for the A2m(1) allele which predominates in Whites, but is less common in Blacks. In a multicenter study, 27 Black IgAN patients were enrolled to investigate this hypothesis and analyze the clinical course of disease in Blacks. The IgA2 allotypes of 18 Black patients and 14 controls were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Three patients were homozygous for the A2m(1) allele, four were homozygous for A2m(2) and 11 were heterozygous. The respective allelic frequencies of A2m(1) and A2m(2) were 0.47 and 0.53 and did not differ significantly from Black controls. Most clinical manifestations of disease did not significantly differ with respect to distribution of the two alleles, although the gender ratio differed between the homozygous A2m(1) and heterozygous patients. The presence of the A2m(1) allele did not increase the risk for IgAN, and the presence of the A2m(2) allele or homozygosity for this allele did not protect Blacks from the development of IgAN.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the accuracy of renal artery duplex scanning for the purpose of diagnosing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, we compared the findings of renal arteriograms to the results of duplex scanning in 41 patients. Using an increase of renal artery peak systolic flow velocity of greater than 180 cm/sec, duplex scanning was able to discriminate normal from diseased renal arteries with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 90%. Using the principle that blood flow velocity across a stenosis is roughly proportional to the degree of stenosis, it appeared that a ratio of the peak velocity in the renal artery to the aorta (RAR) of greater 3.5 predicted a greater than 60% diameter reduction of that renal artery, which is felt to be a significant stenosis. Forty-eight vessels were classified as having a greater than 60% diameter reduction by arteriography. Using the RAR of greater than 3.5, duplex scanning agreed in 44 renal arteries (sensitivity 92%). In the 26 renal arteries where arteriography showed a less than 60% diameter reduction, duplex scanning agreed in 16 vessels and correctly detected a focal narrowing in nine of the remaining ten vessels. Ten of 11 occluded renal arteries were correctly identified by duplex scanning. Duplex scanning determined the location of the renal artery lesion with an accuracy of 95% (kappa 0.74). Since duplex scanning can accurately demonstrate and locate focal renal artery stenosis, we believe it may become an accurate screening test for renovascular hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin-8 (NAP/IL-8) activates neutrophils (PMN) and elicits selective diapedesis of PMN into the extracellular space. The glomerular mesangial cell (MC) is a specialized pericyte that controls glomerular filtration and synthesizes and responds to a variety of cytokines. Because of its location within the glomerulus, the MC is in a pivotal position to orchestrate events underlying immune injury. Since immune-injured glomeruli have been shown to produce NAP/IL-8 activity in vitro, we assessed whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or cytokine-activated MC might be a source of this activity. Pure human MC, devoid of monocyte/macrophage and fibroblast contamination, were grown by explant from collagenase-treated glomeruli. Human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha, 20 ng/ml), IL-1 beta (50 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF, 100 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 micrograms/ml) stimulated release of a neutrophil chemotactic factor from cultured MC. Both concentrated (fivefold) and unconcentrated MC supernatants stimulated directed neutrophil migration under agarose at a level similar to that of the bacterial chemotactic factor, FMLP. In contrast, unstimulated MC-conditioned media and IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta. TNF and LPS in medium alone did not directly induce PMN migration. Molecular sizing studies using sequential membrane ultrafiltration identified significant TNF-stimulated, MC-derived chemotactic activity in the 3000 to 10000 kD fraction. An anti-NAP/IL-8 monoclonal antibody, 46E5, significantly inhibited PMN chemotaxis stimulated by TNF-stimulated, MC-conditioned media in a dose-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the course of the trial, an increased incidence of kidney stone formation was found in the surgery group (4%/year) as compared to the control group (0.4%/year). A matched triplet case-control study was conducted to assess the possible causes for the increased incidence of kidney stones. Three groups were studied: PIB stone-formers (S); PIB non-stone formers (N); and non-PIB, non-stone formers in the control group (C). Initially, 162 patients (54 triplets) were selected. Ten percent of the patients declined to participate which resulted in a sample size of 146 patients. The PIB patients had statistically significant (P less than 0.05) lower levels of serum vitamin D metabolites; lower urine volume, pH, citrate, magnesium, carbon dioxide, and sulfate, and higher urinary oxalate, ammonia and relative supersaturation for calcium oxalate and uric acid than the control patients. Although S and N had similar results, those S with no prior history of stones had a higher calcium oxalate supersaturation than similar N with a negative prior history of stones (P less than 0.025). Based on these results, all PIB patients appear to be at risk for kidney stone formation. The combination of reduced urinary volume and calcium oxalate precipitation inhibitor substance with increased calcium oxalate relative supersaturation produced an increase in nephrolithiasis risk in the PIB groups.\r"

These were used to determine the growth inhibitory effects on Sprague Dawley rat glomerular mesangial cells (MC). Metabolite dilutions were added to cultured MC for 72 hours and [3H]-thymidine incorporation was measured. A 50% growth inhibition by single metabolites (M) on MC was achieved at the following concentrations (mg/liter): Cs: 1.25; M21: 6.0; M18: 9.0; M26: 10.5; M1: 10.8; M8: 10.8; M17: 12.5; M13: greater than 20.0; M25: greater than 25.0; M203-218: greater than 50.0; H355: greater than 50.0. The activity was correlated to the degree of metabolization as the group of six \"active\" compounds included four primary metabolites (hydroxylated or demethylated derivatives of Cs: M21, M18, M1, M17), whereas the four \"inactive\" compounds exclusively were secondary metabolites (demethylated, hydroxylated and/or oxidized primary metabolites: M13, M25, M203-218, H355). Combinations of active metabolites with or without Cs resulted in an additive antiproliferative effect. Although single metabolite activities are not relevant in vivo, already combinations of three (M1 + M17 + M18) or four metabolites (M17 + M18 + M21 + H355) resulted in a significant growth inhibition at concentrations of the participating metabolites measured in urine of liver transplanted patients. Moreover, significant synergistic activities were determined with combinations including secondary metabolites. A final set of experiments discharged unspecific cytotoxic effects. The inhibition of MC [3H]-thymidine incorporation was completely reversible and moreover, direct mesangiolysis was excluded for both single and combined metabolite actions. Thus, considering rat MC proliferation as an initial kidney cell model system for subsequent, more detailed studies measuring functional parameters, we have demonstrated that activities of single metabolites are related to their chemical structure. More importantly, mimicking to some extent the patients' situation, combinations of metabolites at concentrations occurring in vivo reduced MC proliferation in culture in an at least an additive fashion, suggesting that side effects of Cs treatment might be attributed to combined Cs metabolite actions.\r"

  ".W": "Clearances of uncharged dextrans of broad size distribution were used to evaluate the effects of a 30 day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 10 patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria (from 1.4 to 5.6 g/day). Dextran clearance experiments were repeated three times: before enalapril therapy, after 30 days of enalapril and again 30 days after enalapril withdrawal. GFR, but not RPF, was significantly reduced by enalapril (basal 38.3 +/- 11.9, enalapril 30.2 +/- 12.6 ml/min/1.73 m2) and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal. Urinary protein excretion and fractional clearance of albumin were both significantly reduced by enalapril (basal 2.3 +/- 1.1 g/day and 102 +/- 90 x 10(-5), enalapril 1.2 +/- 0.6 g/day and 51 +/- 23 x 10(-5), respectively) and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal. Transglomerular passage of large dextrans (radii 54 to 62 A), but not of lower size (26 to 42 A) were significantly lowered by enalapril. When enalapril was withdrawn the dextran-sieving profile returned comparable to the baseline levels. A theoretical analysis of dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril lowered the radius of largest membrane pores. This effect was independent from glomerular hemodynamic changes. We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) in humans with IgA nephropathy reduces urinary protein excretion by a primary action on the intrinsic glomerular membrane properties enhancing barrier size-selective function. The hypofiltration associated with enalapril therapy in these patients, which was eliminated by its withdrawal, has to be taken into account as a possible undesired effect of CEI in long-term treatment.\r"

Hyponatremia was corrected into normal ranges (140 to 145 mmol/liter) using three different methods. Rats corrected by water restriction achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 2.1 +/- 0.2 day and had a maximal (4 hr) correction rate of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by water diuresis achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 1.6 +/- 0.1 day and had a maximal correction rate of 2.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by hypertonic saline infusion achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 5.4 +/- 0.3 hr and had a maximal correction rate of 5.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter.hr. A fourth control group was not corrected. No demyelinative lesions were found in the brains from the uncorrected rats, whereas the occurrence of such lesions in the brains of the corrected rats was highly correlated with the maximal rate of increase in plasma [Na+] (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001), and to a lesser degree with the magnitude of the increase in plasma [Na+] over the first 24 hours of correction (r = 0.41, P less than 0.001). Brain myelinolysis was first observed in animals whose maximal (4 hr) rate of correction exceeded 1.75 mmol/liter.hr, and the incidence of demyelination increased progressively in rats with more rapid rates of correction. Similarly, myelinolysis was first observed in rats whose magnitude of correction at 24 hours exceeded 16 mmol/liter and also increased in rats with larger 24 hour magnitudes of correction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease may be very common in these patients. The cause of this chest pain seems to be related primarily to an acid-sensitive mucosa regardless of the presence of esophagitis. Unfortunately, a careful history will not distinguish chest pain arising from a cardiac versus an esophageal source. Therefore, all patients must undergo a thorough cardiac evaluation before assuming that acid reflux is the cause of their complaints. Initial gastroenterology evaluation will usually include upper GI endoscopy or barium studies, possibly with acid perfusion (Bernstein) testing, or both. However, the more sensitive and specific test for acid-related disease is prolonged esophageal pH monitoring. This study quantifies the amount of acid reflux but, more importantly, identifies the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux episodes. Patients should be studied in the outpatient setting with emphasis placed on performing activities that replicate their chest pain. Although we presume that acid-induced chest pain responds as well as heartburn to vigorous antireflux regimens, there are few studies to address this issue. Nevertheless, I have had great success in treating these patients with either high-dose H2 blockers or omeprazole therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91375135\r", 
  ".W": "Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac disorder that can readily be diagnosed by characteristic auscultatory and echocardiographic criteria. Although many diseases have been associated with mitral valve prolapse, most affected individuals have the primary form of the disorder. Mitral valve prolapse is an inherited condition commonly associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and its support structures. Complications of mitral valve prolapse, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, infective endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation (with or without chordae tendineae rupture), and cerebral ischemic events, occur infrequently considering the wide prevalence of the disorder. Panic disorder is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by at least three panic attacks within a 3-week period or one panic attack followed by fear of subsequent panic attacks for at least 1 month. It too is a common condition with a prevalence and age and gender distribution similar to that of mitral valve prolapse. Panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse share many nonspecific symptoms, including chest pain or discomfort, palpitations, dyspnea, effort intolerance, and pre-syncope. Chest pain is the symptom in both conditions that most commonly brings the patient to medical attention. The clinical description of chest pain in patients with mitral valve prolapse is highly variable, possibly reflecting multiple etiologies. Chest pain in panic disorder is usually characterized as atypical angina pectoris and as such bears resemblance to the chest pain commonly described by patients with mitral valve prolapse. Multiple investigative attempts to elucidate the mechanism of chest pain in both conditions have failed to identify a unifying cause. Review of the literature leaves little doubt that mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder frequently co-occur. Given the similarities in their symptomatology, a high rate of co-occurrence is, in fact, entirely predictable. There is, however, no convincing evidence of a cause-effect relationship between the two disorders, nor has a single pathophysiologic or biochemical mechanism been identified that unites these two common conditions. Until specific biologic markers for these disorders are identified, it may be impossible to do so. The lack of a proven cause-and-effect relationship between mitral valve prolapse and panic disorder and the absence of a unifying mechanism do not diminish the clinical significance of the high rate of co-occurrence between the two conditions. Primary care physicians and cardiologists frequently encounter patients with mitral valve prolapse and nonspecific symptoms with no discernible objective cause who fail to respond to beta-blockade. Panic disorder should be considered as a possible explanation for symptoms in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A subgroup of these patients who find their way into tertiary care settings and subsequently are found to have no relevant organic pathology are at risk of continuing morbidity. One possible reason for this is that diagnostic strategies often focus on establishing an organic cause of pain and ignore psychosocial factors. In this article I have attempted to describe not only the prevalence but also the clinical characteristics of patients with medically unexplained cardiorespiratory symptoms. A method of establishing a positive diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain has also been outlined. This is based on an interactive and overlapping model that takes into account not only a number of psychological and social factors but also current physical and cardiac risk factors. It is important for nonpsychiatric physicians to diagnose noncardiac pain at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disorder. This would have major beneficial effects for patients, including (1) fewer unnecessary investigations; (2) less distress and functional disability; (3) reduced cost to the hospital; and (4) fewer iatrogenic complications.\r"

The proportion of chest pain patients with CAD who also have a psychiatric disorder may be in the range of 20% to 30%, justifying careful assessment of psychiatric disorders in CAD patients. We conclude that the psychiatric aspects of chest pain are sufficiently prevalent, clinically significant, and a contributor to unnecessarily high utilization of medical services. We call for clinical research to address these questions by outlining three areas of study that will advance our knowledge and care of the patient with chest pain.\r"

In this study, Histoacryl was applied between bone graft and cartilage in one rabbit ear and adjacent to well-vascularized soft tissue with no graft in the opposite ear. Histologic analysis revealed minimal if any inflammation when small amounts of glue was used in the nonvascular region between bone graft and cartilage. However, subcutaneous implantation contacting well-vascularized soft tissue resulted in increased acute inflammation and prolonged foreign-body giant-cell response. Further studies are required to rule out any long-term problems associated with subcutaneous implantation of Histoacryl.\r"

The other 3 cases were intracranial:two cribriform plate damage with frontal lobe injury and hematoma, and 1 damage of the anterior cerebral artery, resulting in death. This rather novel technique, especially when used by less-experienced surgeons, has major complications similar to what has been reported with the traditional intranasal sphenoethmoidectomy. Knowledge of anatomy, good training, and meticulous surgical technique are very important. Endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with extensive pathology should be used with caution, especially if general anesthesia is selected or if excessive bleeding occurs. It would be beneficial to otolaryngologists to have previous experience in the traditional technique before adopting endoscopic sinus surgery to their armamentarium. Even then, major complications may occur in the hands of very experienced surgeons. Early recognition and proper management of these complications are of utmost importance in order to minimize disability or prevent death.\r"

Nonacoustic alternatives which could obviate these encumbrances have not become practical due to inefficient coupling (piezoelectric techniques) or unfeasible power requirements (electromagnetic techniques). Recent technical advances, however, prompted a major clinical investigation of a new electromagnetic, semi-implantable hearing device. This study presents the details of clinical phase I, in which an electromagnetic driver was coupled with a target magnet temporarily affixed onto the lateral surface of the malleus of six hearing aid users with sensorineural losses. The results indicate that the electromagnetic hearing device provides sufficient gain and output characteristics to benefit individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. Significant improvements compared to conventional hearing aids were noted in pure-tone testing and, to a lesser degree, in speech discrimination. Subjective responses were quite favorable, indicating that the electromagnetic hearing device 1. produces no acoustic feedback; 2. works well in noisy environments; and 3. provides a more quiet, natural sound than patients' conventional hearing aids. These favorable results led to phase II of the project, in which patients with surgically amendable mixed hearing losses were implanted with the target magnet incorporated within a hydroxyapatite ossicular prosthesis. The results of this second-stage investigation were also encouraging and will be reported separately.\r"

A subset of 90 patients underwent 166 procedures and were followed an average of 3.5 years. The patients were analyzed according to whether the disease was focal or diffuse, infectious or polypoid, and whether asthma was present. The surgical success rate was 88% in nonasthmatics, but dropped to 50% in asthmatic patients despite total sphenoethmoidectomy. This underscores the importance of this condition as a biological modifier of surgical prognosis.

  ".W": "The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis.\r"

During daily use and auditory performance testing, four electrodes receive simultaneous input. The incoming acoustic signal is amplified and routed to the different electrodes through a band-pass filter system. Mean pure-tone performances were: 500 Hz-29.6 +/- 9.4 dB; 1000 Hz-23.5 +/- 13.2 dB; 2000 Hz-25.4 +/- 9.6 dB; 4000 Hz-32.1 +/- 11.5 dB; and 6000 Hz-42.2 +/- 7.7 dB.

The excellent to normal phonatory quality achieved in many of these patients indicates that the ansa cervicalis to recurrent laryngeal nerve anastomosis is the procedure of choice in selected patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Excellent medialization of the paralyzed cord, as well as correction of arytenoid malposition and thyroarytenoid muscle atrophy appear to explain the technique's success, since the reinnervated cord neither abducts nor adducts. We feel that this technique is the procedure of choice in younger patients, or those who use their voices professionally, since the phonatory quality achieved is superior to Teflon injection or Isshiki thyroplasty, and the technique is reversible.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of the laser in performing microvascular anastomoses has been well established in the laboratory using a number of wavelengths. These studies have concluded that laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses are at least comparable to, if not superior to, ordinary suture techniques. The advantages have been the diminished foreign body reaction that occurs as a consequence of using only a few stay sutures to hold the vessels in approximation while the laser bonding is performed, as well as the rapidity of the surgery. We have already shown that absorbable sutures (polyglactin 910) are as efficacious as standard nonabsorbable sutures (nylon) in both arterial and venous microanastomoses. The current study was undertaken to see if the foreign body reaction could be diminished even further by the use of absorbable 10.0 sutures and compare these findings to laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses performed with nonabsorbable sutures. The carbon dioxide milliwatt laser was used to perform laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses in rat femoral arteries and veins. Patency rates and histological response were compared at intervals of 3 days and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Both arterial and venous patency rates were comparable (overall absorbable, 91.2%-52/57; overall nonabsorbable, 87.7%-50/57), as was the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. We conclude that absorbable sutures can be used for laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses and have the potential of allowing healing to occur without any foreign material within the surgical site.\r"

In this study, a collagen/ceramic carrier containing osteoinductive factor extract (OFE) was used in a rabbit facial augmentation model. Bone-inducing activity of these implants were evaluated in subcutaneous, intramuscular, and subperiosteal sites. Implants with (test) and without OFE (control) were placed on opposite sides of the face in 40 rabbits, and were harvested at 21 days. Bone formation was evaluated by implant alkaline phosphatase determinations and histomorphometry. Osteoblastic activity, bone formation, and preservation of facial augmentation were noted in the OFE implants, showing maximal bone formation when implanted subperiosteally. Control (no OFE) and demineralized bone implants showed no bone formation. Before these implants can be used clinically, novel bone-inducing factors must be manufactured by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methodology to verify activity of the homogeneous molecule which would be free of other proteins or infectious agents.\r"

  ".W": "Survival for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck remains poor, with the major cause of death being local recurrence. Surgical implantation of iodine-125 interstitial seeds allows tumoricidal doses of radiation to be delivered to residual tumor while minimizing radiation doses to the surrounding tissues. From 1978 to 1988, 39 implantations were performed on 35 patients for extensive recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The decision for implantation was based on positive margins or close to resection margins from frozen sections after salvage resection. The determinate 5-year disease-free survival was 41%, with both the overall and no evidence of disease 5-year survivals being 29%. Significant complications occurred in 36% of all cases. This figure increased to 56% when flap reconstruction was required. Possible reasons for this seemingly high complication rate are discussed. Considering the advanced nature of these recurrent carcinomas, surgical resection with iodine-125 seed implantation appears to be an effective method of managing disease that might otherwise be judged unresectable and treated for palliation only.\r"

In the present study, lymphotoxin was found in human middle ear cholesteatoma tissues by the immunoperoxidase method using rabbit anti-human lymphotoxin immunoglobulin G (IgG). Lymphotoxin was localized in the epithelium and connective tissues of the cholesteatomas studied. The epithelium of normal external ear canal skin was lightly stained, but the stain was much weaker than that of the cholesteatomas. In vitro, recombinant human lymphotoxin stimulated proliferation, protein synthesis, and terminal differentiation of basal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that lymphotoxin may be one of the mediators involved in the development of cholesteatoma.\r"

Interjudge ratings were obtained to establish reliability. The location and severity of the laryngotracheal stenosis and the method of treatment were reviewed. Twelve children have a functional voice compared to six preoperatively. Overall, vocal parameters suggested a particular pattern consisting of a lower than optimal pitch and a restricted pitch range. Laryngotracheal reconstruction does make oral communication possible for children who would otherwise have persistent tracheotomy. However, vocal quality appears to be disturbed in most of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Occult (silent) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GER, GERD) is believed to be an important etiologic factor in the development of many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract. In order ot test this hypothesis, a human study and an animal study were performed. The human study consisted primarily of applying a new diagnostic technique (double-probe pH monitoring) to a population of otolaryngology patients with GERD to determine the incidence of overt and occult GERD. The animal study consisted of experiments to evaluate the potential damaging effects of intermittent GER on the larynx. Two hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with otolaryngologic disorders having suspected GERD evaluated from 1985 through 1988 are reported. Ambulatory 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 197; of those, 81% underwent double-probe pH monitoring, with the second pH probe being placed in the hypopharynx at the laryngeal inlet. Seventy percent of the patients also underwent barium esophagography with videofluoroscopy. The patient population was divided into seven diagnostic subgroups: carcinoma of the larynx (n = 31), laryngeal and tracheal stenosis (n = 33), reflux laryngitis (n = 61), globus pharyngeus (n = 27), dysphagia (n = 25), chronic cough (n = 30), and a group with miscellaneous disorders (n = 18). The most common symptoms were hoarseness (71%), cough (51%), globus (47%), and throat clearing (42%). Only 43% of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation). Thus, by traditional symptomatology, GER was occult or silent in the majority of the study population. Twenty-eight patients (12%) refused or could not tolerate pH monitoring. Of the patients undergoing diagnostic pH monitoring, 62% had abnormal esophageal pH studies, and 30% demonstrated reflux into the pharynx. The results of diagnostic pH monitoring for each of the subgroups were as follows (percentage with abnormal studies): carcinoma (71%), stenosis (78%), reflux laryngitis (60%), globus (58%), dysphagia (45%), chronic cough (52%), and miscellaneous (13%). The highest yield of abnormal pharyngeal reflux was in the carcinoma group and the stenosis group (58% and 56%, respectively). By comparison, the diagnostic barium esophagogram with videofluoroscopy was frequently negative. The results were as follows: esophagitis (18%), reflux (9%), esophageal dysmotility (12%), and stricture (3%). All of the study patients were treated with antireflux therapy. Follow-up was available on 68% of the patients and the mean follow-up period was 11.6 +/- 12.7 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The total transmission, absorption, and reflection, as well as the angular distribution of the transmitted and reflected light were measured at five laser wavelengths (442 nm, 514 nm, 633 nm, 804 nm, and 1,064 nm), both for noncontact and contact applications. Absorption and scattering coefficients were determined using the Kubelka-Munk model for light propagation through a scattering tissue. The scleral transmission is only 6% at 442 nm but increases to 35% at 804 nm and to 53% at 1,064 nm. The absorption is high at short wavelengths with 40% at 442 nm but it is only 6% at 804 nm and 1,064 nm. The reflection is generally higher than 40% and shows little wavelength dependence. The transmitted light is scattered diffusely at short wavelengths, but at 804 nm and 1,064 nm it exhibits a fairly narrow angular distribution in forward direction. Fiber contact leads to an increase of transmission, with a factor of 3.5 at 442 nm, of 2.0 at 804 nm, and 1.5 at 1,064 nm. Our results indicate that the diode laser (804 nm) and the Nd:YAG laser (1,064 nm) with contact delivery are best suited for transscleral photocoagulation.\r"

Laser trabecular ablation (LTA) was attempted with the Erbium:YAG (2.94 microns), Erbium:YSGG (2.79 microns), and Holmium:YSGG (2.1 microns) lasers. Laser energy was delivered as a single pulse (250 microseconds) by tissue fiber optic contact with low hydroxyl-fused silica (200 and 500 microns), zirconium fluoride (250 microns), or sapphire (250 microns) fiber optics. Total energy required and thermal effects decreased as laser wavelength increased. LTA was best achieved at 2.94 microns (4 mJ total energy; energy densities = 8.2-12.7 J/cm2; pulse length 250 microseconds) with average thermal damage zones of 5.3-10.3 +/- 1.3-2.4 microns (means +/- SDs) to contiguous structures. This finding has potential applications in the surgical treatment of open-angle and congenital glaucoma and may minimize failure rates seen in other types of surgery on the trabecular meshwork where disrupted trabecular meshwork is not removed.\r"

A 3-m-long 600-microns silica fiber delivered laser energy to the tumor via surface illumination. Using the aiming beam, the spot size was adjusted to include 5 mm of surrounding normal tissue. A thermocouple implanted in the tumor base provided temperature feedback to maintain desired hyperthermic temperature within the lesion. Three spontaneously occurring canine (two squamous cell carcinomas on the gum, one pigmented melanoma on the hard palate) and one feline tumor (squamous cell carcinoma on the nose) have been treated with Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia. Hyperthermia was delivered at 43.5 degrees C for 1 h. All animals received standard radiation treatment prior to hyperthermia. Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia allowed effective and efficient delivery of heat to veterinary nasal and oral lesions otherwise not treatable with conventional heating techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments. First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation. Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts. Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser. However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization. The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization. Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection. At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared. Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion. LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde). In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal. However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min. (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min. (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All cells were exposed to at most a laser spotsize of 2.2 microns diameter and for a laser spotsize of this diameter, we calculated that the central 18.3% of the total energy was in the central area of 0.7 microns diameter. We also found that as little as 0.3 mJ of energy could produce a lesion. No absolute threshold correlation was found between the size or type of lesion and the laser parameters used.\r"

Current models indicate that to produce a letter string, its 'abstract' representation is computed and stored in a temporary orthographic buffer, from which it is converted to a verbal code (if the word is to be spelled aloud) or to a physical letter code (if the word is to be written). The stored graphemic representations specify the identity and order of the component letters and their consonant/vowel status. Here I describe the spelling performance of two patients with a selective deficit in writing vowels. When writing words, the first patient omitted all vowels, leaving a blank space between consonants or consonant clusters, whereas the second produced errors that almost exclusively involved vowels. This pattern of performance supports the hypothesis that the consonant/vowel status of graphemes is differentially specified in the spelling process and may be selectively affected after brain damage.\r"

Its onset is preceded by a long and variable period in which lymphoid cells infiltrate the pancreas but first remain outside the islets (peri-insulitis) before invading them (insulitis). Among susceptibility loci, only the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been clearly assigned. Genetic study of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has revealed genetic linkage of insulitis and of early onset diabetes with two non-MHC loci mapping to chromosome 3 and 11 respectively. Here we report a close association of periinsulitis with a third non-MHC locus mapping to chromosome 1. Successive stages in the progression of diabetic disease thus appear to be controlled by distinct genes or sets of genes.\r"

Several features of the genetics and immunopathology of diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice are shared with the human disease. Of the three diabetes-susceptibility genes, Idd-1 -3 and -4 that have been mapped in mice to date, only in the case of Idd-1 is there any evidence for the identity of the gene product: allelic variation within the murine immune response I-A beta gene and its human homologue HLA-DQB1 correlates with susceptibility, implying that I-A beta is a component of Idd-1. We report here the mapping of Idd-5 to the proximal region of mouse chromosome 1. This region contains at least two candidate susceptibility genes, the interleukin-1 receptor gene and Lsh/Ity/Bcg, which encodes resistance to bacterial and parasitic infections and affects the function of macrophages.\r"

We have isolated complementary DNA clones for two zebrafish pax genes related to Drosophila and mouse paired-box-containing segmentation genes. The expression of these two genes is confined to specific regions in the embryonic forebrain and midbrain. Strikingly, the borders of expression of the two pax genes coincide with morphological landmarks corresponding to the primary axon tracts that are generated in the embryonic brain a few hours after the initiation of expression of these genes.\r"

The mammalian hsp110 protein is nucleolar and redistributes with growth state, nutritional conditions and heat shock. The relationships between hsp110, hsp104 and the high molecular mass heat-shock proteins of other organisms were unknown. We report here that hsp104 is a member of the highly conserved ClpA/ClpB protein family first identified in Escherichia coli and that additional heat-inducible members of this family are present in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in mammals. Mutagenesis of two putative nucleotide-binding sites in hsp104 indicates that both are essential for function in thermotolerance.\r"

Previous analyses in bacteria have suggested that a stem-loop structure involving the UGA codon and adjacent sequences is necessary and sufficient for selenocysteine incorporation into formate dehydrogenase and glycine reductase. We used the recently cloned 5'DI to investigate selenoprotein synthesis in eukaryotes. We show that successful incorporation of selenocysteine into this enzyme requires a specific 3' untranslated (3'ut) segment of about 200 nucleotides, which is found in both rat and human 5'DI messenger RNAs. These sequences are not required for expression of a cysteine-mutant deiodinase. Although there is little primary sequence similarity between the 3'ut regions of these mRNAs and those encoding GPX, the 3'ut sequences of rat GPX can substitute for the 5'DI sequences in directing selenocysteine insertion. Computer analyses predict similar stem-loop structures in the 3'ut regions of the 5'DI and GPX mRNAs. Limited mutations in these structures reduce or eliminate their capacity to permit 5'DI translation. These results identify a 'selenocysteine-insertion sequence' motif in the 3'ut region of these mRNAs that is essential for successful translation of 5'DI, presumably GPX, and possibly other eukaryotic selenocysteine-containing proteins.\r"

Cyclosporin A acts as an inhibitor of T-cell activation and can prevent graft rejection in organ and bone marrow transplantation. Cyclophilin may be responsible for mediating this immunosuppressive response. Cyclophilin also catalyses the interconversion of the cis and trans isomers of the peptidyl-prolyl amide bonds of peptide and protein substrates. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of human recombinant cyclophilin complexed with a tetrapeptide and the identification, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, of the specific binding site for cyclosporin A. Cyclophilin has an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel structure. The prolyl isomerase substrate-binding site is coincident with the cyclosporine-binding site. These results may help to provide a structural basis for rationalizing the immunosuppressive function of the cyclosporin-cyclophilin system and will also be important in the design of improved immunosuppressant drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian cortex is organized in a columnar fashion: neurons lying below each other from the pia to the white matter usually share many functional properties. Across the cortical surface, cells with similar response properties are also clustered together, forming elongated bands or patches. Some response properties, such as orientation preference in the visual cortex, change gradually across the cortical surface forming 'orientation maps'. To determine the precise layout of iso-orientation domains, knowledge of responses not only to one but to many stimulus orientations is essential. Therefore, the exact depiction of orientation maps has been hampered by technical difficulties and remained controversial for almost thirty years. Here we use in vivo optical imaging based on intrinsic signals to gather information on the responses of a piece of cortex to gratings in many different orientations. This complete set of responses then provides detailed information on the structure of the orientation map in a large patch of cortex from area 18 of the cat. We find that cortical regions that respond best to one orientation form highly ordered patches rather than elongated bands. These iso-orientation patches are organized around 'orientation centres', producing pinwheel-like patterns in which the orientation preference of cells is changing continuously across the cortex. We have also analysed our data for fast changes in orientation preference and find that these 'fractures' are limited to the orientation centres. The pinwheels and orientation centres are such a prominent organizational feature that it should be important to understand their development as well as their function in the processing of visual information.\r"

The tumour suppressor gene for Wilms' tumour, WT1, has been characterized: it is expressed at high levels in the glomeruli of the kidney, as well as the gonadal ridge of the developing gonad, the Sertoli cells of the testis and the epithelial and granulosa cells of the ovary, suggesting a developmental role in the genital system in addition to the kidney. We now report constitutional mutations within the WT1 genes of two individuals with a combination of WT and genital abnormalities as evidence of a role for a recessive oncogene in mammalian development.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The principal manifestations of CF include increased concentration of Cl- in exocrine gland secretions, pancreatic insufficiency, chronic lung disease, intestinal blockage and malabsorption of fat, and male and female infertility. Insight into the function of CFTR can be gained by correlating its cell-specific expression with the physiology of those cells and with CF pathology. Determination of CFTR messenger RNA in rat tissues by in situ hybridization shows that it is specifically expressed in the ductal cells of the pancreas and the salivary glands. In the intestine, decreasing gradients of expression of the CFTR gene are observed on both the crypt-villus and the proximal-distal axes. This expression is consistent with CFTR being responsible for bidirectional Cl- transport, secretion in the intestinal crypts and reabsorption in the silivary gland ducts, and suggests that in these tissues CFTR functions as a regulated Cl- channel. In the lung, a broad band of hybridization includes the mucosa and submucosa of the bronchi and bronchioles. In the testis, CFTR expression is regulated during the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Postmeiotic expression is maximal in the round spermatids of stages VII and VIII, suggesting that CFTR plays a critical role in spermatogenesis and that deficiency of this function contributes to CF male infertility.\r"

The infection is spreading at a rate of more than 100 km per year; populations in which the infection was rare have become almost completely infected within three years. Analyses of the spread using estimates of selection in the field suggest dispersal distances far higher than those found by direct observation of flies. Hence, occasional long-distance dispersal, possibly coupled with local extinction and recolonization, may be important to the dynamics. Incompatibility factors that can readily spread through natural populations may be useful for population manipulation and important as a post-mating isolating mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The complex architecture of the limb cartilage pattern probably develops by the sequential segmentation and branching process of precartilaginous cell condensation under the control of positional signalling provided by the zone of polarizing activity (anteroposterior) and the apical ectodermal ridge (proximodistal). This signalling is monitored and interpreted in the mesenchymal cells and induces the position-specific response of subsets of genes. Homeobox genes may be responsible for the interpretation of signalling. A correlation between limb pattern and expression domains of the homeobox genes in the upstream region of Hox/Chox-4 has been proposed. We have analysed the spatial expression pattern of the Chox-1 genes during development of chick limb buds. In contrast to genes in Hox/Chox-4 expressed coordinately along the anteroposterior axis, homeobox genes in Chox-1 have unique and mutually exclusive expression domains along the proximodistal axis. We report here that the expression domains of the Chox-1 genes are closely related to the segmental structure of cartilage along the proximodistal axis, whereas the expression domains of the Chox-4 genes are related to the cartilage branching pattern.\r"

The translocation of apo B100 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its subsequent assembly into lipoprotein particles is of particular interest as the protein is both very large (relative molecular mass 512,000) and insoluble in water. It has been proposed that apo B translocation occurs in discrete stages and is completed post-translationally. Several sites of arrest of translocation were reported to be present in apo B15 (the N-terminal 15% of the protein). We have re-examined this question by in vitro translation coupled with translocation into microsomes, and find no evidence for transmembrane segments in truncated apo B proteins. Translocated apo B17 is strongly associated with the membrane of the ER, being only partially releasable with alkaline carbonate, and remaining bound to the microsomes following disruption with saponin. The efficient binding of short segments of apo B, despite the absence of transmembrane domains, suggests that apo B is cotranslationally inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER. This will obviate problems caused by the size and insolubility of apo B100, because the growing hydrophobic protein chains will never exist in a lipid-free form during translocation. From the inner leaflet, apo B in association with membrane-derived lipid can bud into the lumen of the ER to form nascent lipoprotein particles.\r"

The Tetrahymena telomerase ribonucleoprotein uses an internal RNA template to catalyse d(TTGGGG)n telomere addition to the 3' end of telomeric sequence in vitro and in vivo. Studies of telomerase RNA indicated that hybridization of the RNA template region, 5'-CAACCCCAA-3', to the 3' end of single-stranded telomeric oligonucleotides might be important for primer recognition and utilization. The apparent requirement of telomerase for pre-existing telomeric sequence has raised questions regarding its role in chromosome healing. We report here that Tetrahymena telomerase can specifically elongate single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides whose termini are not complementary to the RNA template sequence 5'-CAACCCCAA-3'. These data suggest that telomerase may be able to heal chromosomes directly in vivo.\r"

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein which, in vitro, recognizes a single-stranded G-rich telomere primer and adds multiple telomeric repeats to its 3' end by using a template in the RNA moiety. In conjunction with other components, telomerase may balance the loss of telomeric repeats due to DNA replication. Another role of telomerase may be the de novo formation of telomeres. In eukaryotes like Tetrahymena, this process is an integral part of the formation of macronuclear chromosomes. In other eukaryotes this process stabilizes broken chromosomes. A case of human alpha-thalassaemia is caused by a truncation of chromosome 16 that has been healed by the addition of telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)n. Using an in vitro assay, I show here that human telomerase correctly recognizes the chromosome 16 breakpoint sequence and adds (TTAGGG)n repeats. The DNA sequence requirements are minimal and seem to define two modes of DNA recognition by telomerase.\r"

In a modification of the technique, we recess only the lateral two thirds of the levator/Muller's complex. Also, rather than excising Muller's muscle, we simply recess it en bloc with the levator aponeurosis. The lateral horn of the levator is cut, as previously advocated, to relieve the marked temporal elevation of the eyelid characteristic of Graves' lid retraction. This modified procedure provides good upper lid lengthening, with less surgical manipulation, less bleeding, and avoids medial over-corrections. Of 22 upper lids (12 patients) treated with this procedure, 19 (86.3%) were considered \"good\" after the operation.\r"

Then a conventional posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) is inserted, with the IOL loops in the groove. The ring not only allows complete maintenance of the circular contour of the capsular bag equator for most conventional PC-IOLs, but also may prevent invasion of metamorphosed lens epithelial cells into the posterior capsule.\r"

The increase was significantly greater in the ipsilateral internal carotid territory, in the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territories (superficial (P less than 0.05), deep territories (P less than 0.001].

All patients had spontaneous pain and allodynia to vibration. They were treated with intravenous regional guanethidine block (RGB). Quantitative sensory testing was performed on both hands before and 1-3 days after treatment. Eleven patients benefitted considerably from the block, with pain relief for 2 weeks or more. Ten of these 11 patients had mild nerve injuries caused by compressive trauma to the nerve. Before RGB they showed a moderate loss in temperature discrimination capacity; their heat pain thresholds were reduced and they exhibited allodynia to cold and vibration on the injured side. After RGB, the pain thresholds were normalised both to thermal and vibratory stimuli. These patients were classified as having sympathetically maintained pain (SMP). Seven patients reported no or only minor pain-relieving effect of RGB lasting 1-5 days. Severe nerve injuries were most frequent in this group of patients. On the injured side, before RGB, their ability to discriminate between warm and cold was markedly impaired, thermal pain thresholds were normal, and they showed allodynia to vibration. After RGB, there was no change in thermal pain thresholds and the allodynia to vibration persisted. These patients were classified as having sympathetically independent pain (SIP). The results indicate that quantitative thermal sensory tests, together with clinical evaluation of the nerve trauma, can help to predict which patients will have long-lasting pain alleviation after RGB treatment.\r"

The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization.\r"

All patients had acute myocardial infarction and less than 6 h of cardiac symptoms. Patients treated with streptokinase had a significantly lower need for nicomorphine (median 20 mg) than patients not treated with streptokinase (median 41 mg). Correspondingly, the median duration (3.5 h) of pain was reduced significantly in patients treated with streptokinase compared to patients not treated (24 h). We conclude that intravenous streptokinase given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is effective in reducing the duration of cardiac chest pain.\r"

Subjects were then exposed to the cold pressor. The results demonstrated that subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor reported experiencing the most pain. Subjects who were highly anxious about the shock reported the least pain and reported significantly less pain than subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor. These findings clearly demonstrate that the relationship between anxiety and pain is not always positive or unidirectional.\r"

Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain.\r"

The study demonstrated that there are many descriptors of pain in the Norwegian language. The final version of the Norwegian pain questionnaire consisted of 106 pain descriptors divided into 18 groups. Validity of the classifications as well as reliability of the words was demonstrated.

Only neurons which responded to TP stimulation with bursts of spikes that were in a constant temporal relationship with the digastric EMG signal were studied. The LRN-stimulating electrodes were positioned at optimal sites to suppress the TP-evoked jaw-opening reflex (JOR) recorded simultaneously with the neuronal activity related to it. It was found that: (1) the neurons in the V nucleus oralis responded to TP stimulation with 3-8 msec latency excitatory responses that were suppressed during LRN conditioning stimulation with a time course comparable to that of the JOR suppression, and (2) the neurons in the V nucleus motor responded to TP stimulation with 5-15 msec latency excitatory responses. This activity was suppressed during LRN-conditioning stimulation with a time course that parallels the inhibition of the activity of nucleus oralis neurons and of the JOR. However, assuming that the excitatory interneurons for the V motoneurons are located in the nucleus oralis, the suppression of this input by LRN may account for the lack of response in V motor neurons. Thus, we suggest that LRN inhibits the TP-evoked JOR by acting on the sensitive afferent limb of the reflex.\r"

On impact against the skin they elicit a brief sensation of pain. This method allows the application of a wide range of controllable innocuous and noxious impact velocities of the cylinder at variable stimulus repetition rates. The system is sufficiently flexible to stimulate perpendicularly any skin area and to move rapidly to adjacent target regions if desired. Psychophysical testing using magnitude estimation techniques revealed that pain thresholds were normally distributed. Over a wide range of stimulation intensities monotonically increasing stimulus response functions were obtained. Repeated testing showed a good intra-individual reproducibility of both threshold and supramaximal pain ratings. The method was also useful in determining the time course of pain and mechanical hyperalgesia following a brief painful stimulus. We conclude that the new technique is useful for evaluating psychophysical stimulus response functions of mechanically induced pain and its changes following tissue injury. This technique may also hold some promise in quantifying altered pain sensitivity in patients.\r"

The aim was to identify the functional anatomical correlates of abolishing unilateral nociceptive input to the brain. Patients were investigated by positron emission tomography using C15O2 to evaluate cerebral blood flow. Comparisons were made between the patients with unilateral pain before cordotomy and normal volunteers. These demonstrated significantly less blood flow in 3 out of 4 of the individual quadrants of the hemithalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.01-0.05). These differences were abolished by cordotomy. Comparison of the patients before and after cordotomy showed a significant decrease in blood flow in the dorsal anterior quadrant of the thalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.05) which was normalised after cordotomy. There were no significant changes in the prefrontal or primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that chronic pain results in a decrease of synaptic activity at thalamic level either from decreased activity in neurones projecting to that region and/or attenuated local neuronal firing. We have demonstrated no secondary remote effects in cortex, indicating the importance of subcortical mechanisms in central responses to chronic pain.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous administration of lidocaine for reducing physiologic instability in acutely ill newborns during clinically required procedures, 81 neonates who required lumbar punctures within the first month of life were stratified by birth weight and respiratory support and randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group received an injection of 0.1 mL/kg of 1% lidocaine prior to the lumbar puncture. The control group received a nonanesthetized lumbar puncture without placebo. Changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and heart rate variability from baseline, preparatory (positioning/handling), lumbar puncture, and recovery periods were measured. The administration of lidocaine did not minimize physiologic instability in response to the lumbar puncture nor was it associated with any detectable adverse effects other than prolonging the duration of the lumbar puncture. Although significant physiologic changes were observed in response to preparatory procedures, few additional changes beyond those occurred in response to lumbar punctures in either the experimental or control group. It is concluded that local anesthesia failed to influence manifestations of physiologic instability during neonatal lumbar punctures and that preparatory procedures were more destabilizing than either the administration of lidocaine or the lumbar puncture itself. The results suggest that the management of newborns requires emphasis on minimizing the destabilizing effects of required and frequent handling procedures.\r"

There was a 70% response and 72 of 101 procedures were considered necessary for residents to develop competency by at least 80% of the program directors. The list of 72 procedures was then sent to 500 randomly selected general pediatricians from a pool size of 10,304. The response rate was 35%. Forty-nine of the 72 procedures were considered necessary by 80% of those responding and one third of the skills (24 of 72) could be classified as absolutely necessary because more than 95% of practitioners considered them to be. Only 7 procedural skills were considered unnecessary by more than 50% of practitioners. It is suggested that program directors consider the 24 skills as ones that should be taught and competence in performing them be verified and recorded.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate one element of managed care, gatekeeping prior approval, for children who use the pediatric ER of one urban public hospital. Over a 6-month period, 518 children and adolescents insured under managed-care plans that required authorization from the primary care physician to receive treatment presented to the ER. Of the 385 records reviewed for this study, the majority (87%) received their primary care at community health centers or the hospital's own outpatient clinics. Most ER visits (72%) were made when primary care sites were closed. According to nursing triage assessment, 57% presented with urgent or emergent conditions, and 26% had a history of chronic illness. Nine percent required hospitalization. Although an elaborate system for gatekeeping was established, only 13 (3%) patients' requests for ER care were denied. Of these, 3 were seen in the ER without authorization, 6 received the recommended follow-up, and 4 were not seen in follow-up. Twenty-nine participating primary care physicians (74%) and 19 ER staff (63%) responded to a survey of their experience with and attitudes toward prior approval. For a variety of reasons, the majority of primary care physicians and ER staff found the gatekeeping policies for after-hours visits burdensome and inappropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data from 10,493 prehospital care reports in 11 counties of California (four emergency medical services systems in rural and urban areas) were collected and analyzed. Comparison of urban and rural data found few significant differences in parameters analyzed. Use of the emergency medical services system by pediatric patients increased with age, but 12.5% of all calls were for children younger than 2 years. Calls for medical problems were most common for patients younger than 5 years of age; trauma was a more common complaint in rural areas (64%, P = .0001). Frequency of vital sign assessment differed by region, as did hospital contact (P less than .0001). Complete assessment of young pediatric patients, with a full set of vital signs and neurologic assessment, was rarely performed. Advanced life support providers were often on the scene, but advanced life support treatments and procedures were infrequently used. This study suggests the need for additional data on which to base emergency medical services system design and some directions for education of prehospital care providers.\r"

Although most physicians (93.1%) stated that they had professional services available to them (at their office location), more than half (53.8%) indicated that the patient's family automobile was their most commonly used method of transport of ill children to tertiary care centers. This was true regardless of the disease entity involved, including suspected epiglottitis. Practice setting had little influence on transport method. However, in general, younger children were judged to need ambulance transport more often than older children. Reasons cited for not using professional transport from the office included a perceived better efficiency of the family car (61.8%), the prohibitively high expense of professional transport (9.8%), and failure to consider professional transport (6.5%). Further study of this component of office preparedness is suggested.\r"

Programs for the care of ill children are discussed to provide the practicing pediatrician with an understanding of the various programs currently or potentially available in the community. The paper ends with a discussion of the various solutions to enhance the economic gains of working parents while serving the need of children for nurturant care.\r"

  ".W": "Ongoing surveys performed by Ross Laboratories demonstrate recent declines both in the initiation of breast-feeding and continued breast-feeding at 6 months of age. Comparing rates in 1984 and 1989, the initiation of breast-feeding declined approximately 13% (from 59.7% to 52.2%), and there was a 24% decline in the rate of breast-feeding at 6 months of age (from 23.8% to 18.1%). The decline in breast-feeding was seen across all groups studied but was greater in some groups than in others. Logistic regression analysis indicates that white ethnicity, some college education, increased maternal age, and having an infant of normal birth weight were all positively associated with the likelihood of both initiating breast-feeding and continuing to breast-feed to at least 6 months of age. Women who were black and who were younger, no more than high school educated, enrolled in the Women, Infants and Children supplemental food program, working outside the home, not living in the western states, and who had an infant of low birth weight were less likely either to initiate breast-feeding or to be nursing when their children were 6 months of age. The factors influencing the decline in breast-feeding were not uniform. There were fewer sociodemographic factors associated with the decline in the initiation of breast-feeding than in the decline in prolonged breast-feeding. While the disparity between older and younger mothers in initiating breast-feeding increased, there was an offsetting trend as the disparity associated with parity decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the incidence of breast-feeding has more than doubled in the United States in recent years, this increase has been less evident among blacks and in lower socioeconomic groups. To understand better this lower incidence, cognitive and personality correlates of breast-feeding were examined in two independent lower-class samples: 137 black inner-city mothers and 50 predominantly white mothers. Ego development, depression, and verbal competence were assessed during the first postpartum year. Only 21.9% of the black sample chose to breast-feed, in contrast with 58.0% of the white sample. Although unrelated to depression and social support, breast-feeding was positively associated with ego level and cognitive ability in both samples. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, which was found to be valid in relation to maternal and infant characteristics for the black socially disadvantaged sample. When compared using multiple regression analysis, the relation of ego maturity to breast-feeding was generally stronger than that of cognitive ability. Women with more ego maturity may breast-feed because of increased feelings of empathy or nurturance or because they are more attuned to current health advisories and able to deviate from community norms to adopt breast-feeding practices more characteristic of the white middle class.\r"

The present study investigated the effects of garlic ingestion by the mother on the odor of her breast milk and the suckling behavior of her infant. Evaluation of the milk samples by a sensory panel revealed garlic ingestion significantly and consistently increased the perceived intensity of the milk odor; this increase in odor intensity was not apparent 1 hour after ingestion, peaked in strength 2 hours after ingestion, and decreased thereafter. That the nursling detected these changes in mother's milk is suggested by the finding that infants were attached to the breast for longer periods of time and sucked more when the milk smelled like garlic. There was a tendency for infants to ingest more milk as well; the lack of a significant effect may be due to the inherent limitations on the total amount of milk available to the infant.\r"

  ".W": "Factors influencing early formula supplementation in breast-fed neonates were examined among 726 women who were delivered of their first child in one of three metropolitan Washington, DC, hospitals. Thirty-seven percent of breast-fed neonates were given supplementary formula in the hospital. Mothers who gave birth at a university hospital were more likely to breast-feed exclusively (adjusted odds ratio 3.5; 95% confidence limit 2.1 to 5.9), after adjustment for maternal demographics, hospital factors (such as time of first breast-feed, demand feeding, delivery type, and rooming-in), and the maternal breast-feeding commitment. Aside from delivery hospital, a strong predictor of formula use was the time between birth and initiation of the first breast-feed. The longer a mother waited to initiate breast-feeding the more likely she was to use formula; the adjusted odds ratios for women who initiated breast-feeding 2 to 6 hours, 7 to 11 hours, and 12 or more hours postpartum were 1.1, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively. Feeding the baby on demand, having a vaginal delivery, deciding to breast-feed before pregnancy, having a college education, and being married also were moderately, though significantly, predictive of exclusive breast-feeding. The findings suggest that hospital influences can promote formula use and indirectly shorten breast-feeding duration, particularly those hospital practices that delay early initiation of breast-feeding.\r"

There is little information on longitudinal breast milk concentrations of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or the effects of maternal phylloquinone supplements on breast milk. In study part 1, 11 lactating mothers, who received 20 mg of phylloquinone orally, had rises in plasma (less than 1 to 64.2 +/- 31.5 ng/mL by 6 hours) and breast milk concentrations (from 1.11 +/- 0.82 to 130 +/- 188 ng/mL by 12 hours). In part 2, 23 lactating mothers and their infants were observed longitudinally along with a formula-fed control group of infants (n = 11). Mean breast milk concentrations of phylloquinone at 1, 6, 12, and 26 weeks were 0.64 +/- 0.43, 0.86 +/- 0.52, 1.14 +/- 0.72, and 0.87 +/- 0.50 ng/mL, respectively, in the infants fed human milk. Maternal phylloquinone intakes (72-hour dietary recalls) exceeded the recommended daily allowance of 1 microgram/kg per day. Infant phylloquinone intakes did not achieve the recommended daily allowance of 1 microgram/kg per day in any infant. Plasma phylloquinone concentrations in the infants fed human milk remained extremely low (mean less than 0.25 ng/mL) throughout the first 6 months of life compared with the formula-fed infants (4.39 to 5.99 ng/mL). In this small sample, no infant demonstrated overt vitamin K deficiency. Despite very low plasma phylloquinone concentrations, vitamin K supplements (other than in the immediate newborn period) cannot be recommended for exclusively breast-fed infants based on these data.\r"

The implications of managing such problems by changing milk formulas is explored. Mothers of 379 infants were enrolled in the postpartum period. Information about problems of feeding and crying behavior was obtained at 4 months. Thirty-six percent of the infants had problems and the formula had been changed for 17%. At 3 1/2 years, 320 (84%) mothers completed a questionnaire. Children who had had problems were more often perceived as vulnerable (relative risk [RR] 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 3.19) and more often had behavior problems (RR 1.78; 95% CI 1.03, 3.07). There were no differences in personality. Children whose problems had been managed by changing milk formulas were more often perceived as vulnerable (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.05, 4.53). Although allergies were reported significantly more often for those children who had had problems, there were no differences in the prevalence of asthma or eczema. Problems of feeding and crying behavior in early infancy and the way they are managed may have long-term implications for the child.\r"

A questionnaire mailed to 375 members of the American Academy of Pediatrics asked about age, marital status, number of children, type of practice, hours worked in particular duties, and attitudes about their choices. Sixty-five percent (n = 216) of the questionnaires were completed. The mean age of both the PT and FT women was 40 years, and FT men averaged 46 years. Thirty-seven percent of women had worked PT at some point in their careers; 21% were currently working PT. Only 70% of the FT women were married compared with 97% and 95% of PT women and FT men. The FT women had significantly fewer children (mean 1.27, compared with 2.34 for PT women and 2.39 for FT men). Part-time women in academic medicine tended to do little research or administrative work, but they had more teaching responsibilities. Almost all the PT women were happy with their decisions and careers despite the feeling among many that they had made career compromises. Many of the FT pediatricians wanted to work less. It is concluded that many women, particularly those with children, choose PT work in order to combine career and family duties. These choices may lead to different career paths for women pediatricians. By recognizing these different career paths, it may be possible for academic institutions to benefit from the unique contributions that PT women pediatricians can make.\r"

One component of a community-wide program, training of schoolchildren in street-crossing skills, is evaluated. The program targeted public school students in grades K through 4 with an eight-session training program by a single teacher, cross-age teaching, videotape feedback, and in 1990 parent-child activity workbooks. Children's street crossing was observed pretraining and posttraining and graded on four behaviors: WALKING on sidewalk/shoulder vs in the street; STOPPING at the curb; LOOKING L-R-L before crossing; KEEP LOOKING while crossing. Analysis was conducted on matched pairs in which observations pretraining were compared with those posttraining on same child. Observations were completed on 137 children in 1989 and 92 in 1990. Nearly all children walked on the side of the road; however, fewer than 50% of children STOPPED, 25% LOOKED, and fewer than 20% KEPT LOOKING before training. Training did not improve the performance on the first two behaviors in either year, significantly increased LOOKING in 1990, and increased KEEP LOOKING by twofold in 1989 and threefold in 1990. It is concluded that pedestrian skills of children can be improved but that such a program must be part of a broader effort if pedestrian injuries are to decrease.\r"

However, in this study, these children were divided into two age groups which were reflective of differences in behavior and development. The data demonstrate differences in the circumstances of the pedestrian injury events between toddlers (0 through 2 years and ambulatory) and preschoolers (3- and 4-year-olds). Toddlers were more likely to be injured in nontraffic events whereas preschoolers were more frequently injured in traffic situations. A high proportion of toddler injuries occurred in residential driveways and were caused by vehicles backing up. The majority of preschoolers, often without supervision, were injured while crossing/darting midblock on residential streets near their homes. Reflecting these differences in circumstances and also developmental differences between toddlers and preschool children, there is a need for age-specific interventions to reduce pedestrian injuries in children younger than 5 years of age.\r"

Restrictions were greatest for fractures/dislocations and sprains and for injuries due to sports, play/recreational activities, and falls.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the knowledge and problem-solving, communication, and clinical skills of graduating neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) and pediatric residents, a cohort study was conducted in a 33-bed tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit in a 400-bed teaching hospital affiliated with a faculty of health sciences. Participants were all (n = 10) NNP graduates from the first 3 years of the educational program and 13 (87%) of 15 second-year pediatric residents. One hundred multiple-choice questions and 20 radiographic slides were used to test knowledge; a semistructured oral examination tested problem-solving skills; three simulated interactions with parents tested communication skills; and seven simulated procedures tested clinical skills. Graduating NNPs scored similarly to the pediatric residents on the multiple-choice questions (difference -3.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] around difference -9.7, 2.9), radiographs (difference -1.4%; 95% CI -11.5, 8.7), oral examination (difference 2.8%; 95% CI -11.1, 16.7), communication skills (simulated parents assessment: difference 0.8%; 95% CI -4.2, 5.7; expert observer assessment: difference 5.8%; 95% CI -2.8, 14.3), and clinical skills (difference 7.4%; 95% CI -5.5, 20.2). The NNPs about to graduate from their educational program showed knowledge and problem-solving, communication, and clinical skills equivalent to those of second-year pediatric residents and are thus likely to deliver comparable care in the clinical setting. The results support the adoption of the NNP role.\r"

Variations in the frequency of visits to 164 preterm neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit were examined in relation to infant and family status variables and compliance with follow-up appointments at 3 months postterm. The mean number of visitors decreased from day 2 to day 12 of hospitalization and then remained stable through day 21. There was a corresponding increase in the number of days with no visitors through day 12, and then stabilization. Neonates who had intraventricular hemorrhages, whose parents did not live together, and who were not firstborn had the most days with no visitors. While the mother was hospitalized herself, her condition was the only variable related to percentage of no-visitor days. The sicker the mother, the more likely the newborn had no visitors. The greater the number of days with no visitors, the poorer the likelihood that the infant was brought to a 3-month follow-up clinic appointment.\r"

The sample consisted of 242 infants who were admitted during a 3-year period with temperatures greater than or equal to 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) and had a chest radiograph. The house officer recorded the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms including rhinorrhea, tachypnea, cough, rales, wheezes, retractions, and rhonchi. Each chest radiograph was reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria by a senior radiology resident and an attending pediatric radiologist. Interobserver agreement was 91%. Both observers were blind to the infants' respiratory signs. The chest radiograph interpretations were compared with the presence of respiratory signs. Of the 242 cases, 228 had chest radiographs available for interpretation. Of these, 27 chest radiographs (12%) were identified as abnormal, including 6 where there was initial disagreement as to the presence of an abnormality. Twenty-five (31%) of 80 infants with any respiratory signs had an abnormal chest radiograph, whereas only 2 (1%) of 148 asymptomatic infants did. The sensitivity of respiratory signs was 93% (confidence interval = 76% to 99%). These findings suggest that in the absence of respiratory signs, febrile infants are unlikely to have an abnormal chest radiograph.\r"

It also assessed the effectiveness of an anonymous questionnaire in eliciting information on maternal use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. Meconium was collected from 500 consecutively born infants and analyzed for the presence of cocaine and its metabolites. An anonymous two-page questionnaire also was distributed to all postpartum mothers. Of the infants' mothers, (73.2%) were covered by some form of insurance (private), whereas 26.8% either had no insurance or were covered by Medicaid (clinic). Fifty-nine (11.8%) babies tested positive for cocaine. The meconium of 6.3% of the babies whose mothers had private insurance tested positive, while the meconium of 26.9% of the babies whose mothers had Medicaid or no insurance tested positive. 316 (63.2%) of the mothers returned a questionnaire. 73% had private insurance and 27% were covered by Medicaid (clinic). Only five mothers with no insurance or covered by Medicaid admitted using cocaine. It appears that neonatal exposure to cocaine may be an even greater problem than previously imagined, particularly in the private population. In addition, anonymous maternal self-reporting forms probably will not be helpful in identifying infants at risk for illicit exposure to drugs.\r"

Intelligence tests and medical examinations performed at the military draft board were stratified according to serum bilirubin concentration. A logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the confounding effects of gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, ethnic origin, socioeconomic class, paternal education, birth order, and the administration of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. No direct linear association was shown between neonatal bilirubin levels and intelligence test scores or school achievement at 17 years of age. However, the risk for low intelligence test scores (IQ score less than 85) was found to be significantly higher (P = .014) among full-term male subjects with serum bilirubin levels above 342 mumol/L (20 mg/dL) (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-6.79). This association was not observed among female subjects. We conclude that severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, among full-term male newborns with a negative Coombs test, could be associated with lower IQ scores at 17 years of age.\r"

Because reflux to a limited extent is physiologic, the determination of optimal thresholds to separate normal from abnormal reflux is mandatory. Esophageal pH was measured during 24 hours in 509 healthy thriving infants, aged 3 days to 1 year, using a glass microelectrode with an external reference electrode connected to a portable recorder. Percentiles of the four parameters studied (reflux index or percent of the investigation time with a pH less than 4, number of episodes with a pH less than 4 during 24 hours, number of episodes lasting greater than 5 minutes, the duration of the longest episode (in minutes) are presented. A percentile curve of the reflux index regarding the age distribution shows that the normal range for the reflux index during the first 12 months of life is about 10% (95 percentile), decreasing from 13% at birth to 8% at 12 months. Application of an age-related percentile curve offers a close-to-reality possibility of data interpretation and illustrates that there is inevitably an overlap of data between normal and abnormal populations, because reflux is a phenomenon occurring to some extent in every human being.\r"

By 15 years of age, one quarter of students reported engaging in behaviors that placed them at higher risk for acquiring infection with human immunodeficiency virus, and 3% of students reported engaging in very high-risk behaviors. Students exposed to certain psychosocial stressors (ie, adverse life circumstances and poor parental support), who engaged in other problem behaviors (ie, substance use and academic problems) and who had higher self-esteem, were more likely to engage in higher risk behaviors. Pediatricians and other clinicians, particularly those working in or near AIDS epicenters, who encounter adolescents with multiple psychosocial problems, should be alert to the possibility that these youths also are engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for AIDS. Comprehensive care for these teenagers must include an assessment of involvement in AIDS-risk behaviors and appropriate behavioral counseling.\r"

We encourage the use of these standards with the examination of patients who have Prader-Willi syndrome and in the comparison of the patient who has Prader-Willi syndrome with other similarly affected individuals. The standards may also be useful for assisting in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly in younger individuals.\r"

Nearly 90% of directors responded, providing information on 1915 residents. Of the 1782 nonmilitary residents in the United States, 815 were entering general pediatric practice and one third (596) were entering subspecialty training. Nearly one half (379) of residents entering general pediatric practice were joining a small group practice, almost one fourth (184) were joining a larger group, 6% (48) were becoming solo practitioners, 7% (57) were joining a health maintenance organization, and nearly 8% (62) were joining a hospital or academic staff. Most residents in the United States experienced no difficulty finding a position and received multiple offers for jobs. Canadian residents were similar to residents in the United States, whereas the postresidency situations of graduates of military and Puerto Rican programs were very different. Despite manpower predictions to the contrary, comments by program directors indicated a demand for general pediatricians. This paper presents only the viewpoint of program directors; whether this perceived need illustrates an avid market for young general pediatricians merits further study.\r"

The predictors did not explain a significant amount of the variance in caregivers' physical health, but they did explain 43% of the variance in both depression and anxiety. The only coping pattern that added to the explanations was Wishing-Emotive coping, which consisted of the coping subscales of escape-avoidance, confrontive coping, and accepting responsibility. Caregivers' appraisal of stress was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, but neither the severity of the patients' problems nor caregivers' appraisal of options was a significant predictor of any of the health outcomes.\r"

Families with preterm infants (N = 110) were categorized as employed, nonemployed, and on leave of absence based on the mother's employment status at three months postpartum. There were no significant differences across employment groups on family functioning and child development. The infant's motor development was positively correlated with number of hours employed per week and degree of choice for the employed mother families, but negatively correlated with choice for the nonemployed mother families. These results suggest that maternal employment may not be detrimental for infants born prior to term. Indeed, it may be beneficial, especially if the mother has a choice in the matter.\r"

Subjects were assessed four times per day, on four consecutive days, for a total of 16 assessments. At each of the 16 conditions for a given subject, 10 CVM contractions lasting 12 seconds each were recorded and the variables, maximum pressure (MP10), peak maximum pressure (PMP), and abdominal pressure were analyzed. The within-subject variance was 15.5 (SD = 3.9); the between-subject variance was 132.4 (SD = 11.5). The effects of day, time, and stressor were analyzed by ANOVA specifically designed for variance estimates; no significant differences were found. The clinical observations that led to the study were not supported when systematically investigated. However, consistent data collection procedures appeared to reduce within-subject variance.\r"

Empowering potential was a continuous process of individual growth and development which facilitated the emergence of new and positive health patterns. Within the process of empowering potential, individuals use a variety of strategies which guide the initiation and maintenance of health-related change. The process of empowering potential consists of three stages: appraising readiness, changing, and integrating change. Two categories occurred throughout the process of empowering potential: imaging and social support systems. These findings provide a better understanding of how motivated action is initiated and reinitiated over time.\r"

Activation is the conversion of RepA dimers into monomers in an ATP-dependent reaction and the monomer form binds with high affinity to oriP1 DNA. Reversible chemical denaturants also convert RepA dimers to monomers and simultaneously activate oriP1 DNA binding. Increasing protein concentration converts monomers to dimers and deactivates RepA. Based on our data and previous work, we present a model for heat shock protein action under normal and stress conditions.\r"

Increased expression and mutations in specific amino acids have been closely linked to alterations of normal cell morphology, growth, and differentiation and, in particular, to neoplastic transformation. The signal transduction induced by these p21ras proteins is largely unknown; however, the signaling pathways of several growth factors have been reported to involve phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase. In the present study of a Ha-ras-transformed epithelial cell line, we demonstrated increased PtdIns 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-receptor (insulin and hybrid insulin-like growth factor I) immunoprecipitates of cells that had been stimulated with insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. The PtdIns 3-kinase activity was also immunoprecipitated in these experiments by the anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259. The specificity of this association with p21ras was ascertained by the neutralizing effect of the antigen peptide and the absence of PtdIns 3-kinase activity in Y13-259 immunoprecipitates from cells in which the ras gene was turned off. These data indicate that PtdIns 3-kinase activity is an important step in the cascade of reactions in p21ras signal transduction, suggesting that the alterations of the cytoskeleton and growth in ras-transformed cells could be mediated by PtdIns 3-kinase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The signal transduction pathway initiated by type I interferon (alpha and beta interferons) is inhibited by expression of the adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene. Cotransfection analyses with the E1A oncogene and an interferon-stimulated reporter gene show that mutations within an amino-terminal domain of the E1A oncoprotein are defective in transcriptional repression. Cotransfection experiments also revealed that the transcriptional repression is mediated through the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) found within the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes. Since interferon treatment activates a latent cytoplasmic DNA-binding factor that can recognize the ISRE and subsequently stimulate transcription, the appearance of this factor was analyzed in a cell line that constitutively expresses the E1A oncogene. The DNA binding activity of this transcriptional activator was found to be inhibited in the E1A-expressing cell line. In vitro cytoplasmic mixing experiments with extracts from control and E1A-expressing cells identified a specific component of this multimeric transcription factor to be defective.\r"

  ".U": "91376057\r", 
  ".W": "In Paramecium tetraurelia, cyclic nucleotides are important physiological second messengers that could regulate dynein mechanochemistry by phosphorylation. A 29-kDa polypeptide that is phosphorylated in a cAMP- and Ca(2+)-sensitive manner in permeabilized cells and isolated axonemes is the only significant phosphorylated moiety that consistently copurifies with 22S dynein from paramecium cilia. It is not a component of 14S dynein. This polypeptide can be thiophosphorylated in a cAMP-sensitive manner, and this form of 22S dynein is stable when stored at -70 degrees C. cAMP-mediated thiophosphorylation of the 29-kDa polypeptide significantly increases the velocity with which 22S dynein causes microtubules to glide in vitro. The increase is abolished, together with the thiophosphorylation of the 29-kDa polypeptide, by preincubation with high Ca2+. Pretreatment with high Ca2+ does not alter the thiophosphorylation pattern of, or the velocity of microtubule translocation by, 14S dynein. The same preincubation conditions that permit or abolish the increase in velocity of microtubule translocation by 22S dynein permit or fail to permit swimming speed of permeabilized cells to increase on reactivation even after cAMP is removed. The effect of cAMP on swimming speed can therefore be accounted for by changes in the mechanically coupled 22S dynein activity via phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation of the 29-kDa polypeptide, which could act as a regulatory dynein light chain.\r"

  ".U": "91376059\r", 
  ".W": "Helper T lymphocytes recognize peptide fragments of antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Previous studies showed that the MHC class II, I-Ek molecules purified from APCs that had processed Drosophila melanogaster cytochrome c (DMc) contained functional, processed antigen-I-Ek complexes. This was demonstrated by the ability of purified I-Ek, incorporated into liposomes, to stimulate DMc-specific T cells in the absence of any additional antigen. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the processed antigen bound to I-Ek. This was accomplished using DMc radiolabeled across its entire length by reductive methylation of its lysine residues, allowing an analysis of the totality of processed antigen bound to MHC class II molecules. After processing, only about 0.2% of the APC I-Ek molecules contained processed DMc (approximately 800 per cell), yet these were sufficient to stimulate specific T cells. The DMc peptides isolated from the I-Ek molecules showed only two predominant radioactive peaks as analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography. Less processed antigen was bound to purified I-Ak molecules, and these peptides were distinct from those bound to I-Ek. The association of processed DMc with the I-Ek and I-Ak molecules appears highly specific in that no radiolabeled peptides were isolated from purified MHC class I molecules, Kk and Dk, or from the B-cell differentiation antigen B220. The majority of processed antigen-I-Ek complexes migrated more slowly than the majority of the I-Ek protein as analyzed by SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions without heating of the sample. This form of I-Ek may be analogous to the earlier described \"floppy\" form of MHC class II molecules [Dormair, K., Rothenhausler, B. & McConnell, H. M. (1990) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 54, 409-416]. Since newly processed antigen binds nearly exclusively to this slow-migrating form, it may be of functional significance.\r"

Our results show that these patches contain channels that can be opened by cGMP, but not by Ca2+. These cGMP-activated channels closely resemble the channels activated by light in cell-attached patches. This evidence suggests that cGMP is the messenger that opens the light-dependent channel in invertebrate photoreceptors.\r"

In primates fast, low-contrast visual information is carried by the magnocellular subdivision of the visual pathway, and slow, high-contrast information is carried by the parvocellular division. In this study, we found that dyslexic subjects showed diminished visually evoked potentials to rapid, low-contrast stimuli but normal responses to slow or high-contrast stimuli. The abnormalities in the dyslexic subjects' evoked potentials were consistent with a defect in the magnocellular pathway at the level of visual area 1 or earlier. We then compared the lateral geniculate nuclei from five dyslexic brains to five control brains and found abnormalities in the magnocellular, but not the parvocellular, layers. Studies using auditory and somatosensory tests have shown that dyslexics do poorly in these modalities only when the tests require rapid discriminations. We therefore hypothesize that many cortical systems are similarly divided into a fast and a slow subdivision and that dyslexia specifically affects the fast subdivisions.\r"

To elucidate factors controlling keratinocyte-specific gene expression, we previously identified proximal and distal regulatory elements that act synergistically to drive keratinocyte-specific expression of the gene encoding human epidermal keratin K14. Control by the proximal element is mediated by a transcription factor, KER1, which is more abundant in nuclear extracts of keratinocytes than in extracts of other cell types, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and simple epithelial cells. In this report, we identify this factor as transcription factor AP2, shown to be transcribed in cells of epidermal and neural crest lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate functional AP2 binding sites upstream from three additional epidermal genes, suggesting that AP2 may be generally involved in epidermal gene regulation. Finally, although AP2 is necessary, it is not sufficient for epidermal gene expression: a distal element contributes to tissue-specific expression of the human keratin K14 gene as judged by its ability to enhance expression of a heterologous promoter in keratinocytes but not in hepatoma cells. These results imply that a combination of factors is likely to contribute to epidermal-specific expression of the human keratin K14 gene.\r"

The two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy spectrum of the antibody-antigen complex shows sharp, well-resolved resonances from at least half of the bound peptide residues, indicating that the peptide retains considerable mobility when bound to the antibody. The strongly immobilized residues (which include Arg-61, Trp-62, Trp-63, and Ile-78) do not correspond to a contiguous region in the sequence of the peptide. Examination of the crystal structure of the protein shows that these residues, although remote in sequence, are grouped together in the protein structure, forming a hydrophobic projection on the surface of the molecule. The antibody binds hen egg lysozyme with only a 10-fold lower affinity than the peptide antigen. We propose that the peptide could bind to the antibody in a conformation that brings these groups together in a manner related to that found in the native protein, accounting for the high crossreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Ternary complexes of RNA polymerase, bearing the nascent RNA transcript, are intermediates in the synthesis of all RNAs and are regulatory targets of factors that control RNA chain elongation and termination. To study the catalytic and regulatory properties of RNA polymerases during elongation, we have developed methods for the preparation of these intermediates halted at defined positions along a DNA template. To our surprise, some of these halted complexes undergo a reaction in which the RNA transcript is cleaved up to 10 nucleotides from its 3'-terminal growing point. The 5'-terminal fragment, bearing a free 3'-OH residue, remains bound to the RNA polymerase-DNA complex and can resume elongation, whereas the 3'-terminal oligonucleotide of 2-10 nucleotides, bearing a 5'-phosphate, is released. RNA cleavage occurs only in the ternary complex and requires a divalent metal ion such as Mg2+. Since RNA polymerases are believed to have a single catalytic site for nucleotide addition, this reaction is unlikely to be due to hydrolysis catalyzed by this site comparable to the 3'----5' exonuclease activity associated with the catalytic center found for some DNA polymerases. Nor is this reaction easily explained by models for transcription elongation that postulate a 12-base-pair DNA.RNA hybrid as intermediate. Instead, we suggest that this is an unusual kind of protein-facilitated reaction in which tight binding of the RNA product to the enzyme strains the RNA phosphodiester linkage, resulting in cleavage of the RNA well away from the catalytic center. By this model, the nascent RNA enters a product binding site beginning 3 or 4 nucleotides from the growing point at the 3' terminus. This RNA binding site extends for up to 16 nucleotides along the protein surface. The stress brought about by this binding appears to vary considerably for different ternary complexes and may play a role in driving the translocation of the RNA polymerase along the DNA.\r"

IFN-alpha treatment of Daudi cells results in a rapid and transient increase in the cellular content of diacylglycerol, which occurs in the absence of inositol phospholipid turnover, or an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Furthermore, IFN-alpha treatment results in a selective, time-dependent activation of the Ca(2+)-independent epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKC), while the alpha isoform is unaffected by IFN-alpha treatment. In contrast, IFN-alpha treatment of an IFN-resistant subclone of Daudi cells had no effect on the diacylglycerol content of cells and on the activation of PKC-epsilon. The selective PKC inhibitor staurosporine blocked the transcriptional activation of IFN-alpha-stimulated genes, the cytoplasmic accumulation of mRNAs for these genes, and the induction of antiviral activity by IFN-alpha against vesicular stomatitis virus in IFN-sensitive cells. These observations suggest that transmembrane signaling of IFN-alpha involves diacylglycerol production and activation of PKC-epsilon in Daudi cells.\r"

Furthermore the specificity for HRV binding is entirely contained within the first 88 amino acids. Mutagenesis of the four sites of N-linked glycosylation within the second domain shows that carbohydrate is not involved in virus recognition. Homologue replacement mutagenesis localizes the epitopes for virus-blocking antibodies to two regions of domain 1 predicted to form beta strand D and the loop between the F and G strands of an immunoglobulin-fold structure. Analysis of virus binding to the mutants predicts a large surface of contact between HRV and ICAM-1 domain 1 but shows that the regions most important for virus binding are coincident with the monoclonal antibody epitopes.\r"

The Wyeth strain of vaccinia virus was used for the construction of the recombinant. Cattle vaccinated with the recombinant virus were 100% protected from challenge inoculation with greater than 1000 times the lethal dose of rinderpest virus. No transmission of recombinant vaccinia virus from vaccinated animals to contact animals was observed. The lyophilized form of vaccinia virus is thermostable and allows circumvention of the logistical problems associated with the distribution and administration of vaccines in the arid and hot regions of Asia and Africa. The insertional inactivation of both the thymidine kinase and the hemagglutinin genes of vaccinia virus led to increased attenuation of the virus; this was manifested by the lack of detectable pock lesions in vaccinated animals. This approach may have wide application in the development of safe and efficacious recombinant vaccines for humans and animals. This becomes quite relevant with the concern of the use of vaccinia virus in a population with high incidence of the human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

We have studied the possibility that the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol/inositol phosphoglycan (glycosyl-PtdIns/IPG) system is involved in transmitting this NGF signal. Endogenous glycosyl-PtdIns was characterized in extracts of cochleovestibular ganglia (CVGs) that incorporated [3H]glucosamine, [3H]galactose, [3H]myristic acid, and [3H]palmitic acid. Incubation of CVG with NGF produced a rapid and transient hydrolysis of glycosyl-PtdIns. Hydrolysis was complete at 100 ng/ml, and the half-maximal effect occurred at 25 ng/ml, overlapping with the concentration dependence of the mitogenic effect of NGF. An IPG was isolated from embryonic extracts. It had biological effects similar to those reported for the insulin-induced IPG in other tissues. It exerted a powerful mitogenic effect on CVG, comparable to that of NGF. Both the IPG- and NGF-induced cell proliferation were blocked by anti-IPG antibodies that recognized the endogenous IPG on a silica plate immunoassay. These results show that CVG possesses a fully active glycosyl-PtdIns/IPG signal transduction system and that the proliferative effects associated with NGF binding to low-affinity receptors require IPG generation.\r"

  ".W": "Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with Ti plasmids containing tandem genome repeats derived from different strains of the gemini-virus beet curly top virus (BCTV) resulted in the production of unit-length recombinant progeny genomes in systemically infected plants. When two putative plus-strand origins of replication were present in constructs used as inocula, a replicational escape mechanism was favored that resulted in progeny genomes of a single predominant genotype. The genotype was dependent upon the arrangement of repeated parental genomes in the inocula. Sequencing across the junction between parental BCTV strains in the recombinant progeny allowed mapping of the plus-strand origin of replication to a 20-base-pair sequence within the conserved hairpin found in all geminivirus genomes. In contrast, when inocula contained tandemly repeated BCTV genome sequences but only a single conserved hairpin, a number of different progeny genotypes were simultaneously replicated in infected plants, a result expected if unit-length viral genomes were generated by random intramolecular recombination events. These results and other considerations indicate that geminivirus DNA replication occurs by a rolling-circle mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The physical mapping of complex genomes is based on the construction of a genomic library and the determination of the overlaps between the inserts of the mapping clones in order to generate an ordered, cloned representation of nearly all the sequences present in the target genome. Evaluation of the relative efficiency of experimental procedures used to accomplish this goal must minimally include a comparison of the fraction of the genome covered by the ordered arrays (or \"contigs\"), the average size of the contigs, and the cost, in terms of time and resources, required to generate the map. Sequence-tagged-site (STS) content mapping is one strategy that has been proposed and is being utilized for this type of experiment. This paper describes three STS selection schemes and presents computer simulations of contig-building experiments based on these procedures. The results of these simulations suggest that a nonrandom STS strategy that uses paired probes requires one-third to one-fourth as many STS assays as are required in random and nonpaired approaches, and also results in a map that has both greater genome coverage and a larger average contig size. This strategy promises to reduce the time and cost required to build a high-quality physical map.\r"

  ".U": "91376082\r", 
  ".W": "An approach involving retroviral-mediated gene therapy for the treatment of neoplastic disease is described. This therapeutic approach is called \"virus-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy\" (VDEPT). The VDEPT approach exploits the transcriptional differences between normal and neoplastic cells to achieve selective killing of neoplastic cells. We now describe development of the VDEPT approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Replication-defective, amphotrophic retroviruses were constructed containing a chimeric varicella-zoster virus thymidine kinase (VZV TK) gene that is transcriptionally regulated by either the hepatoma-associated alpha-fetoprotein or liver-associated albumin transcriptional regulatory sequences. Subsequent to retroviral infection, expression of VZV TK was limited to either alpha-fetoprotein- or albumin-positive cells, respectively. VZV TK metabolically activated the nontoxic prodrug 6-methoxypurine arabinonucleoside (araM), ultimately leading to the formation of the cytotoxic anabolite adenine arabinonucleoside triphosphate (araATP). Cells that selectively expressed VZV TK became selectively sensitive to araM due to the VZV TK-dependent anabolism of araM to araATP. Hence, these retroviral-delivered chimeric genes generated tissue-specific expression of VZV TK, tissue-specific anabolism of araM to araATP, and tissue-specific cytotoxicity due to araM exposure. By utilizing such retroviral vectors, araM was anabolized to araATP in hepatoma cells, producing a selective cytotoxic effect.\r"

  ".W": "Dihydrotestosterone, the primary mediator of prostate growth, is synthesized in target tissues from the circulating androgen testosterone through the action of steroid 5 alpha-reductase (EC 1.3.99.5). The expression of 5 alpha-reductase and the level of 5 alpha-reductase messenger RNA in rat ventral prostate are regulated by androgens. To determine whether this control is mediated by dihydrotestosterone or testosterone, we investigated the effect of finasteride, a potent inhibitor of steroid 5 alpha-reductase, on the expression of 5 alpha-reductase in the prostate. The administration of finasteride to intact rats for 7 days caused a 55% decrease in prostate weight and an 87% decrease in 5 alpha-reductase enzyme activity. Furthermore, the restoration of prostate growth after castration and the enhancement in 5 alpha-reductase enzyme activity and 5 alpha-reductase messenger RNA level by testosterone administration were blocked by finasteride, whereas the inhibitor had no effect on dihydrotestosterone-mediated increases in 5 alpha-reductase activity or messenger RNA level. These findings indicate that dihydrotestosterone itself controls prostate growth and 5 alpha-reductase activity. They further suggest that prostate growth is controlled by a feed-forward mechanism by which formation of trace amounts of dihydrotestosterone induces 5 alpha-reductase, thereby increasing dihydrotestosterone synthesis and triggering a positive developmental cascade.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the axonal transport of two strains of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) within the central nervous system of cebus monkeys. Each strain was injected into the \"arm area\" of the primary motor cortex. One strain, HSV-1(McIntyre-B), was transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to project to the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., ventrolateral thalamus). In addition, \"second-order\" neurons were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate and interpositus) and in the globus pallidus (internal segment). This result supports the concept that the arm area of the primary motor cortex is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia output. In contrast, the other strain, HSV-1(H129), was transported transneuronally in the anterograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to receive input from the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., putamen, pontine nuclei). In addition, \"third-order\" neurons were labeled in the cerebellar cortex (granule and Golgi cells) and in the globus pallidus (largely the external segment). Our observations suggest that strain differences have an important impact on the direction of transneuronal transport of HSV-1. Furthermore, it should be possible to examine the organization of cerebellar and basal ganglia loops with cerebral cortex by exploiting transneuronal transport of HSV-1 and virus strain differences.\r"

The association of RNA polymerase II with the Inr was enhanced by the general transcription factors. The Inr was capable of directing the formation of a DNA-protein complex. Transcription competent complexes on the adenovirus major late and IVa2 promoters appear to be formed by alternative pathways mediated through the Inr and/or \"TATA\" motif. The presence of both motifs, however, is required for efficient transcription utilizing a discrete start site. Complexes formed at either site required transcription factor TFIID, the TATA binding protein. Consistent with this observation, a TFIID requirement was demonstrated for transcription from a mutant adenovirus major late promoter construct lacking a functional TATA motif.\r"

The results confirm that matrix ultrastructure and the concentration of matrix protein are influenced by the respiratory state of mitochondria and the osmolarity of the external medium. At physiological osmolarity, a fluorescent metabolite-sized probe was found to diffuse slowly in the mitochondrial matrix but not to be completely immobile. In addition, significant differences in diffusion rates were found to exist between different mitochondrial respiratory states, with the slowest diffusion occurring in states with the highest matrix protein concentration. These data support the concept of a matrix structure in which diffusion is considerably hindered due to limited probe-accessible water and further suggest that volume-dependent regulation of matrix protein packing may modulate metabolite diffusion and, in turn, mitochondrial metabolism.\r"

Gene targeting also holds potential for correcting genetic defects as an approach to human gene therapy. To precisely modify target genes, homologous recombination must proceed with high fidelity. However, several results have suggested that targeted recombination may be highly mutagenic. To test the accuracy of gene targeting we analyzed 44 independent targeted recombinants at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in a human fibroblast cell line and in mouse embryonic stem cells. We surveyed 80 kilobases around the sites of recombination by using chemical cleavage of mismatches. Only two mutations were found: a T----G transversion and a thymidine deletion. Thus, gene targeting in mammalian cells can be extremely accurate. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating precise modifications of mammalian genomes by gene targeting.\r"

  ".W": "Two VLA proteins (or beta 1 integrins; originally called very late activation antigens) that bind to distinct determinants on fibronectin (FN) are increased on activated immune or memory T cells. VLA-4 binds to the peptide sequence Gly-Pro-Glu-Ile-Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ser-Thr (GPEILDVPST in single-letter code) on the alternatively spliced CS-1 form of FN, whereas VLA-5 binds to an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found on all forms of FN. It has been proposed that the migration of immune T cells out of blood vessels and through connective tissue to a site of antigenic challenge is facilitated by the interaction of such integrins with matrix protein molecules. We have examined directly the role of T-cell integrins in vivo by using the well-characterized, T-cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to the hapten trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB). We demonstrate that the cells that transfer CHS to TNCB adhere to FN in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+, and T-cell populations depleted of FN-adherent cells do not transfer immunity. We further show that TNCB-immune T cells treated with the synthetic peptides GPEILDVPST or Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP in single-letter code), ligands for VLA-4 and VLA-5, respectively, lose their ability to mediate this immune response in a murine model, whereas the control peptides Val-Ile-Pro-Asp-Leu-Thr-Glu-Ser-Pro-Gly and Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro have no effect. Neither GPEILDVPST nor GRGDSP significantly inhibited the proliferative response of TNCB-immune T cells in vitro. These data suggest that FN-binding integrins on T cells play a role in the localization of T cells to sites of antigenic challenge in tissue.\r"

Conversely, we have raised three distinct monoclonal antibodies against the soluble TCR heterodimers and shown that they recognize surface-expressed TCRs. Two of these antibodies were found to react specifically with the products of the V alpha 2 (V delta 8) and V beta 2 gene segments, respectively.

A truncated soluble form of human CD4 (sCD4) was found to stimulate dissociation of the external subunit (gp120) from the envelope glycoprotein complex of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expressed at the cell surface. sCD4 stimulation of gp120 release was time- and concentration-dependent and was associated with specific binding of sCD4 to gp120. Synthetic peptide derivatives corresponding to residues 81-92 of human CD4 (overlapping the complementarity-determining region 3-like region) inhibited cell-cell fusion mediated by the interaction between recombinant vaccinia-encoded CD4 and human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein. These peptide derivatives also stimulated gp120 release from the envelope glycoprotein complex. An analogous peptide derivative from chimpanzee CD4 (containing a single Glu----Gly substitution at the position corresponding to CD4 residue 87) was considerably less active at inhibition of cell-cell fusion and stimulation of gp120 release, consistent with the known inhibitory effect of this substitution on the ability of membrane-associated CD4 to mediate cell fusion. These results suggest that the sCD4-induced release of gp120 reflects postbinding structural changes in the envelope glycoprotein complex involved in membrane fusion, with the complementarity-determining region 3-like region playing a critical role.\r"

Activation by Tat requires a cis-acting element, the transactivation response (TAR) site, located in the viral long terminal repeat and the 5' end of all viral mRNAs. Sequences in TAR RNA can fold into a specific stem-loop structure, and certain features of the stem-loop are essential for Tat-mediated transactivation. In Xenopus oocytes, TAR sequences can inhibit the translation of 3' cis-linked mRNAs. However, coinjection of Tat and the TAR-containing RNA into oocyte nuclei relieves this translational inhibition [Braddock, M., Chambers, A., Wilson, W., Esnout, M. A., Adams, S.E. & Kingsman, S.M. (1989) Cell 58, 269-279]. We report here that the intramolecular TAR stem-loop structure is a substrate for the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-modifying activity, which converts adenosines to inosines. This activity is located in the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. The specificity and extent of modification of adenosines in TAR is dependent on Tat. We propose that the dsRNA-modifying activity may be one of the cellular proteins that interacts with TAR in the nucleus. The possible role of TAR RNA modification in the expression of HIV-1 is discussed.\r"

Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retrovirus vectors that contain human factor IX cDNA linked to heterologous promoters and the neomycin-resistant gene were constructed and employed to prepare recombinant retroviruses. Rat CECs and NIH 3T3 cells infected with these viruses were selected with the neomycin analogue, G418 sulfate, and tested for expression of factor IX. A construct with the factor IX cDNA under direct control by long terminal repeat gave the highest level of expression (0.84 and 3.6 micrograms per 10(6) cells per day for CECs and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively) as quantitated by immunoassays as well as clotting activity assays. A single RNA transcript of 4.4 kilobases predicted by the construct and a recombinant factor IX of 68 kilodaltons identical to purified plasma factor IX were found. The recombinant human factor IX produced showed full clotting activity, demonstrating that CECs have an efficient mechanism for posttranslational modifications, including gamma-carboxylation, essential for its biological activity. These results, in addition to other properties of the endothelium, including large number of cells, accessibility, and direct contact with the circulating blood, suggest that CECs can serve as an efficient drug delivery vehicle producing factor IX in a somatic gene therapy for hemophilia B.\r"

  ".W": "A semisynthetic RNase, RNase-(1-118).(111-124), consisting of a noncovalent complex between residues 1-118 of RNase (obtained from the proteolytic digestion of RNase A), and a synthetic 14-residue peptide containing residues 111-124 of RNase, exhibits 98% of the enzymatic activity of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (EC 3.1.27.5). The replacement of aspartic acid-121 by asparagine in this semisynthetic RNase to form the \"D121N\" analog reduces kcat/Km to 2.7% of the value for RNase A. In the present work, 1H NMR spectroscopy has been used to probe the ionization states of His12, His105, and His119 in this catalytically defective semisynthetic RNase. A comparison of the observed resonances of D121N with those previously determined by others for RNase A enabled us to assign the C2 proton NMR resonances to individual residues; the assignment of His119 was confirmed by titrating D121N with the fully deuterated peptide, [Asn121]-RNase-(111-124). The observed pKa values of His12, His105, and His119 decrease 0.18, 0.16, and 0.02 pH unit, respectively, as a result of the D121N replacement. Values calculated by using a finite difference algorithm to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (the DELPHI program, version 3.0) and a refined 2.0-A coordinate set for the crystal structure of D121N differ significantly for active site residues His12 (delta pKa = -0.58) and His119 (delta pKa = -0.55) but not for His105 (delta pKa = -0.10). The elmination of bound water from the calculations reduced, but did not reconcile, these discrepancies (His12, delta pKa = -0.36; His119, delta pKa = -0.41).\r"

In all cases tested, enzymes specific for the same amino acid from a variety of organisms grouped together, reinforcing the supposition that the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are very ancient enzymes that evolved to include the full complement of 20 amino acids long before the divergence leading to prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzymes are divided into two mutually exclusive groups that appear to have evolved from independent roots. Group I, for which two sequence segments were analyzed, contains the enzymes specific for glutamic acid, glutamine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and arginine. Group II enzymes include those activating threonine, proline, serine, lysine, aspartic acid, asparagine, histidine, alanine, glycine, and phenylalanine. Both groups contain a spectrum of amino acid types, suggesting the possibility that each could have once supported an independent system for protein synthesis. Within each group, enzymes specific for chemically similar amino acids tend to cluster together, indicating that a major theme of synthetase evolution involved the adaptation of binding sites to accommodate related amino acids with subsequent specialization to a single amino acid. In a few cases, however, synthetases activating dissimilar amino acids are grouped together.\r"

Although apathogenic in African green monkeys, simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from African green monkeys is shown to display extensive genetic variability and defectiveness in the V1- and V2-like variable domains of the external envelope protein comparable to that known for human immunodeficiency virus. However, in contrast to the situation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals, a predominant major virus variant was detected neither in a monkey naturally infected for more than 10 years nor in two monkeys infected with a molecular virus clone for 15-20 months. Extensive variability evolves from a single genotype with a maximal rate of 7.7 mutations per 1000 nucleotides per year. A remarkable selection for nonsynonymous mutations that accounts for 92% of all changes indicates continuous selection of variants.\r"

Cytogenetic and immunologic studies demonstrated that tumors from different parts of the world are very similar, suggesting that they are transferred from one animal to another by the transplantation of viable cells. We found that the c-MYC oncogene was rearranged in this tumor by the insertion of a transposable genetic element sequence (known as LINE, long interspersed element) 5' to the first exon. The amplification of a DNA segment located in the junction of the LINE genome and c-MYC upstream sequences enabled the testing of the similarity of transmissible venereal tumor samples collected independently in different parts of the world. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the LINE/c-MYC junction were used to amplify a 340-base-pair segment and nested primers amplified a 280-base-pair segment. A fifth oligonucleotide used as a probe contained the actual junction sequence. All of the tumors analyzed revealed the existence of the specific bands, which were absent in normal canine DNA samples. The amplified segments obtained from all of the tumors analyzed were identical in size and nucleotide sequence, suggesting transmission of the original rearranged cell itself, as opposed to independent events of LINE insertion in a \"hot spot.\"\r"

Expression of an AMY1 cDNA in yeast thus leads to four secreted forms with distinct pI values between 4.7 and 5.1 and essentially identical Mr. AMY1-1 and AMY1-2 lacking the C-terminal Arg-Ser are generated by carboxypeptidase in vitro from AMY1-3 and AMY1-4, respectively. In vivo processing is due to the KEX1-encoded yeast carboxypeptidase. AMY1-2 and AMY1-4 are fully active, whereas AMY+-1 and AMY1-3 retain 3-4% activity toward p-nitrophenyl maltoheptaoside and have one fewer SH group, due to reaction with glutathione. AMY1-1-AMY1-4 are indistinguishable from malt AMY1 with respect to Ca(2+)-, substrate-, and beta-cyclodextrin-binding as well as recognition by three monoclonal antibodies and limited proteolysis by proteinase K. Transient AMY1 precursors present in barley aleurone protoplasts were trapped by addition of serine carboxypeptidase inhibitors, indicating that endogenous carboxypeptidase participates in the maturation of AMY1 during germination. Three pairs of precursor/mature AMY1 forms are recognized, presumably corresponding to the three genes encoding AMY1. Malt carboxypeptidase II can convert in vitro the precursors isolated from protoplasts into processed enzyme, and AMY1 from malt accordingly lacks the C-terminal heptapeptide. This report thus demonstrates posttranslational protein modification by carboxypeptidase in higher plants.\r"

Separation of strains of different phenotype occurs along a thin horizontal channel between two stirred chambers, the lower one containing a chemical attractant. The channel is bounded above and below by rigid filters, permeable to the attractant but not to the bacteria. The lower part of the channel is occupied by a porous plate comprising a vertical array of capillary tubes. An aliquot of cells is injected at one end of the channel and eluted by continuous flow of cell-free medium. Fluid leaving the other end of the channel is collected in a fraction collector. Cells that respond to the gradient swim to the bottom of the channel where they are retarded by the capillary array. Nonmotile cells sink to the bottom and are trapped in a similar manner. Motile cells that fail to respond to the gradient diffuse across the full height of the channel and, thus, travel through the apparatus at the average velocity of the eluent. When mixed with wild-type cells at a ratio of 1:1000 and subjected to an aspartate gradient, aspartate-blind cells were recovered quantitatively. The enrichment was approximately 200 to 1. The wild-type cells that survived the selection had a poorly motile phenotype.\r"

The amino acids directly involved in coenzyme binding are conserved between horse EE and human beta 1 beta 1 alcohol dehydrogenase in all but one case [serine (horse) vs. threonine (human) at position 48]. As a result, the coenzyme molecule is bound in a similar manner in the two enzymes. However, the strength of the interactions in the vicinity of the pyrophosphate bridge of NAD+ appears to be enhanced in the human enzyme. Side-chain movements of Arg-47 and Asp-50 and a shift in the position of the helix comprising residues 202-212 may explain both the decreased Vmax and the decreased rate of NADH dissociation observed in the human enzyme vs. the horse enzyme. It appears that these catalytic differences are not due to substitutions of any amino acids directly involved in coenzyme binding but are the result of structural rearrangements resulting from multiple sequence differences between the two enzymes.\r"

These enzymes may erode the connective tissue in atherosclerotic plaques, leading to fissuring and acute thrombotic events. Cell-specific stromelysin expression in human atherosclerotic plaques was studied by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Sections were taken from nine coronary arteries: eight with well-established plaques and one normal. Unambiguous signals were seen in five plaques, two were inconclusive, and the remaining sample was negative, as was the normal coronary artery. Stromelysin mRNA transcripts were localized to isolated individual cells, some of which were smooth muscle, in the plaque cap, intima, and adventitia, but not the media. Expression was also seen in large clusters of macrophages that contained intracellular lipid deposits. The isolated expression of stromelysin by smooth muscle cells may reflect local connective tissue remodeling associated with growth and the formation of the plaque, whereas the more extensive expression associated with macrophages may be of greater pathological significance, contributing to the destabilization of the extracellular matrix and eventual plaque rupture.\r"

Furthermore, the PDGF-BB isoform bound to cells in a neuron-enriched culture from newborn rat brains and induced c-Fos protein in these cells. Continuous PDGF-BB treatment of primary rat brain cell cultures resulted in outgrowth of neurites and prolonged survival. These results indicate a neurotrophic effect of PDGF-BB.\r"

To investigate the molecular events that govern the slow binding reaction, we have determined the dependence of complex formation and dissociation on peptide concentration. The complex between the purified major histocompatibility complex class II protein I-Ek and a fluoresceinated peptide representing amino acids 89-104 of pigeon cytochrome c (FpCytc) was studied. Two important results emerge from this study. (i) At pH 5.4, the half-time for I-Ek-FpCytc complex formation is equal to approximately 7 hr for peptide concentrations that vary over a range of three orders of magnitude. There is in fact a small but significant decrease in the half-time for complex formation at low peptide concentrations. The small decrease in half-time is related to the release of endogenous peptides. (ii) At large ratios of peptide to protein [( FpCytc]/[I-Ek] greater than 40), the half-times for I-Ek-FpCytc complex formation and dissociation are equal to one another to within a factor of two between pH 7.5 and 4.5. The percent results demonstrate that a slow, first-order reaction precedes complex formation between I-Ek and FpCytc. This first-order reaction may involve a protein conformational change in addition to the release of endogenous peptides.\r"

The membranes were lipid bilayers supported on mica surfaces; one carrying streptavidin receptors, the other exposing biotin ligand groups. We found that, although no unusual or specific interaction occurs between two avidin or two biotin surfaces, an avidin and a biotin surface exhibit a very strong, very short-range (less than 1 nm) attraction and that the binding mechanism involves equally specific molecular rearrangements. The results also show that highly specific biological interactions such as are involved in immunological recognition and cell-cell contacts may be studied at the molecular level and in real time by the surface-forces-apparatus technique.\r"

The in vitro reconstituted ribonucleoprotein (core) particles were characterized by their morphology, mass, and radii of gyration. During the assembly of the 30S subunit, the 16S rRNA underwent significant conformational changes that were governed by the cooperative interactions of the ribosomal proteins. The sequential association of the first 12 proteins with the 16S rRNA resulted in the formation of core particles containing up to three mass centers at distinct stages of the assembly process. These globular mass centers may correspond to the three major domains (5', central, and 3') of the 16S rRNA. Through the subsequent interactions of the late assembly proteins with the 16S rRNA, two of the three domains merge, yielding the basic structural traits of the native 30S subunit. The fine morphological features of the native 30S subunit became distinctly resolved only after the addition of the full complement of proteins. The fully reconstituted 30S subunits are active in polyphenylalanine synthesis assays. Visualization of the assembly mechanism of the E. coli 30S ribosomal subunit revealed domain-specific folding of the 16S rRNA through the formation of distinct intermediate core particles hitherto not observed.\r"

Contained within p54 is an arginine/serine-rich region similar to segments of several proteins that participate in pre-mRNA splicing including the 70-kDa component of U1 small nuclear and \"suppressor-of-white-apricot\" proteins. The arginine/serine-rich region is dominated by a series of 8-amino acid imperfect repetitive motifs (consensus sequence, Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg). Antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of p54 react with an approximately 70-kDa protein on immunoblots of HeLa cell and rat liver nuclear proteins. This apparent discrepancy in mass is also observed when p54 mRNA is translated in vitro. Indirect immunofluorescence studies in HeLa cells show that p54 is distributed throughout the nucleus in a speckled pattern, with an additional diffuse labeling of the nucleus excluding the nucleoli. Double immunofluorescence experiments indicate that these punctate regions are coincident with the speckles seen in cells stained with antibodies against several constituents of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Sedimentation analysis of HeLa cell extracts on sucrose gradients showed that p54 migrates at 4-6 S, indicating that the protein is not a tightly associated component of snRNPs. Although the function of p54 is not yet known, our structure and immunolocalization data suggest that this protein may have a role in pre-mRNA processing.\r"

By extending segregation analysis methods to disorders that involve both a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene locus, we show that the available pedigree data for LHON are most consistent with a two-locus disorder, with one responsible gene being mitochondrial and the other nuclear and X chromosome-linked. Furthermore, we have been able to extend the two-locus analytic method and demonstrate that a proportion of affected females are likely heterozygous at the X chromosome-linked locus and are affected due to unfortunate X chromosome inactivation, thus providing an explanation for the later age of onset in females. The estimated penetrance for a heterozygous female is 0.11 +/- 0.02. The calculated frequency of the X chromosome-linked gene for LHON is 0.08. Among affected females, 60% are expected to be heterozygous, and the remainder are expected to be homozygous at the responsible X chromosome-linked locus.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays an important role in hematopoiesis and host defense via interaction with specific cell-surface receptors in target tissues. We identified a truncated, soluble form of the low-affinity GM-CSF receptor (GMR) in chorio-carcinoma cells. Low-affinity GMR cDNAs encoding both the membrane-bound and soluble receptors were obtained by PCR using primers corresponding to the published sequence. Clones encoding the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound form but contained a 97-nucleotide internal deletion. The amino acid sequence of this deleted cDNA predicts a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C terminus. Expression of the soluble GMR cDNA in murine psi-AM cells as well as GM-CSF-dependent myeloid 32Dc13 cells produced a secreted protein that retained its capacity to bind GM-CSF in solution. RNase protection analysis indicates that this variant cDNA is derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors have been identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a general feature of this class. The striking similarity between the soluble form of the GMR and other hematopoietin receptors suggests that soluble binding proteins may play an important role in regulating the broad spectrum of biological responses mediated by these cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Plant cutin monomers trigger, and glucose suppresses, the expression of the cutinase gene of pathogenic fungi. To identify the cutinase promoter region responsible for induction by the unique plant components, a promoter analysis was done with transformants. Plasmids were constructed that contained (i) the 5' flanking region of the cutinase gene or its deletion mutants from Fusarium solani pisi fused with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and (ii) a constitutive promoter fused with a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. Hygromycin-resistant transformants of F. solani pisi generated by electroporation were assayed for CAT activity inducible by cutin hydrolysate and for glucose repression of this induction. CAT was induced in a glucose-repressible manner when fused with a 360-base-pair (bp), or longer, segment of the 5' flanking region of the cutinase gene, and deletion of the next 135 bp abolished this induction. Gel retardation assays showed that a protein(s) in nuclear extract from the fungus bound to the 5' flanking region of cutinase gene, and this binding was also abolished when the same 135-bp segment was deleted. These results show that the -225 to -360 segment of the cutinase gene contains a cis-acting regulatory element that binds trans-acting factor(s) in the nuclei. Treatment of the nuclear extract with immobilized phosphatase abolished binding to the promoter, suggesting that binding required a phosphorylated form of the protein. With isolated nuclei, phosphorylation of a protein occurred only in the presence of both cutin monomer and the fungal protein factor. The presence of protein kinase inhibitor H7 during the preincubation of nuclei with the monomer and protein factor inhibited cutinase gene transcription. These results suggest that cutin monomer causes phosphorylation of a transcription factor that binds to the -225 to -360 segment of the cutinase gene and enhances transcription of this gene.\r"

The full-length cDNA was 2060 base pairs long, and the cDNA encoded 574 amino acids, the same number as that by rat R-type PK. Compared with human L-type PK, R-type PK was 31 amino acids longer at the amino terminus. We also cloned and characterized R-type PK cDNA clones from patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia from a PK deficiency, PK Tokyo. A single nucleotide substitution (ACG to ATG) was found at nucleotide 1151 of the coding sequence of the R-type PK, which caused an amino acid substitution, Thr384----Met. Dot blot hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from patients and their parents by allele-specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the parents, who were second cousins, were heterozygous. To confirm that the nucleotide change was responsible for the variant phenotype, we expressed the L-type PK with the single amino acid change in Escherichia coli and characterized the enzyme. The variant PK was thermolabile and moved slowly in the polyacrylamide gel buffered in 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.3; these characteristics were fully compatible with data obtained from the patient's PK. From these results, we concluded that enzymatic stability of the variant was affected by the point mutation of the PK-encoding gene.\r"

  ".U": "91376116\r", 
  ".W": "Iron-regulated ferritin synthesis in animals is dominated by translational control of stored mRNA; iron-induced transcription of ferritin genes, when it occurs, changes the subunit composition of ferritin mRNA and protein and is coupled to translational control. Ferritins in plants and animals have evolved from a common progenitor, based on the similarity of protein sequence; however, sequence divergence occurs in the C termini; structure prediction suggests that plant ferritin has the E-helix, which, in horse ferritin, forms a large channel at the tetrameric interface. In contemporary plants, a transit peptide is encoded by ferritin mRNA to target the protein to plastids. Iron-regulated synthesis of ferritin in plants and animals appears to be very different since the 50- to 60-fold increases of ferritin protein, previously observed to be induced by iron in cultured soybean cells, is accompanied by an equivalent accumulation of hybridizable ferritin mRNA and by increased transcription of ferritin genes. Ferritin mRNA from iron-induced cells and the constitutive ferritin mRNA from soybean hypocotyls are identical. The iron-induced protein is translocated normally to plastids. Differences in animal ferritin structure coincide with the various iron storage functions (reserve for iron proteins and detoxification). In contrast, the constancy of structure of soybean ferritin, iron-induced and constitutive, coupled with the potential for vacuolar storage of excess iron in plants suggest that rapid synthesis of ferritin from a stored ferritin mRNA may not be needed in plants for detoxification of iron.\r"

PU1 has been administered to HeLa cells in culture to examine the feasibility of influencing transcription of the c-myc gene in vivo. It is shown that uptake of PU1 into the nucleus of HeLa cells is efficient and that the compound remains intact for at least 4 hr. In nuclei extracted from PU1-treated cells, inhibition of DNase I cleavage is detected within the c-myc P1 promoter at the target site for triplex formation. The inhibition is shown to be both site and oligodeoxyribonucleotide specific. After cellular uptake of PU1, it is shown that steady-state mRNA arising from the c-myc P1 initiation site is selectively reduced relative to total mRNA, relative to mRNA from the alternative c-myc P2 initiation site, and relative to mRNA derived from the beta-actin promoter. Significant mRNA repression is not seen upon treating cells with oligodeoxyribonucleotides that fail to bind to the P1 promoter target. Taken together, these data suggest that triplex formation can occur between an exogenous oligodeoxyribonucleotide and duplex DNA in the nucleus of treated cells.\r"

Strand-specific repair of UV, 4'-hydroxymethyl1-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen, and cis-dicholorodiammine platinum(II) damage was dependent upon transcription and a functional nucleotide excision repair system and was stimulated by 6% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol. A defined system consisting of the transcription and repair proteins in highly purified form did not perform strand-specific repair; however, active fractions of extract conferred strand specificity to the defined system. Transcription-repair coupling activity was partially purified from extract by successive DEAE-agarose and gel filtration chromatography. The coupling factor is heat-labile, with an estimated Mr of 100,000.\r"

  ".W": "The rate of renaturation for complementary DNA strands can be enhanced greater than 10(4)-fold by the addition of simple cationic detergents, and the reaction is qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to that found with purified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein. Under optimal conditions, renaturation rates are greater than 2000-fold faster than reactions run in 1 M NaCl at 68 degrees C. The reaction is second-order with respect to DNA concentration, and reaction rates approach or equal the rate with which complementary strands are expected to encounter each other in solution. Renaturation can even be observed well above the expected melting temperature of the duplex DNA, demonstrating that some cationic detergents have DNA double-helix-stabilizing properties. The reaction is also extremely rapid in the presence of up to a 10(6)-fold excess of noncomplementary sequences, establishing that renaturation is specific and relatively independent of heterologous DNA. This finding also implies that up to several thousand potential target sequences can be sampled per strand per second. Such reagents may be useful for procedures that require rapid nucleic acid renaturation, and these results suggest ways to identify and design other compounds that increase the kinetics of association reactions. Moreover, this work provides further support for a model relating the existence of flexible, weakly interacting, repeating domains to their function in rapid molecular assembly processes in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The organization of amplified DNA in mammalian cells in the form of inverted repeats rather than tandem repeats was first observed and studied in the 3B rat cell line. The structure and chromosomal location of the amplified inverted duplications in this cell line have been further analyzed by cloning, long-range mapping, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The amplification unit is at least 450 kilobases in size and all of the amplicons are located in a single chromosomal location of approximately 10 or 11 megabases. No heterogeneity in either size or molecular structure is detected between the 3B amplicons, indicating that the 20- to 40-fold amplification occurred in a single event and not through a series of events, which would result in heterogeneity among the amplicons. Thus the amplification in 3B cells may reflect more closely the situation seen in tumors containing amplified oncogenes/protooncogenes than the amplifications present in cell lines after multiple selections with cytotoxic drugs. The progenitor Rat-2 cell line contains three alleles of the region of DNA that is amplified in 3B cells; two are located on the two normal homologues of rat chromosome 2 and the third is at the equivalent position on a marker chromosome, der(3)t(2;3). 3B cells contain only one of the two normal homologues of chromosome 2 in addition to chromosome der(3)t(2;3). All of the amplified DNA is located on a new marker chromosome, M2, whose amplified DNA region does not resemble chromosome 2. These results are consistent with the amplification model proposed by Passananti et al. [Passananti, C., Davies, B., Ford, M. & Fried, M. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 1697-1703], in which the excision from a chromosome of the DNA to be amplified results in the loss of rearrangement of that chromosome. In this model the excised DNA can be amplified extrachromosomally during a single S phase before becoming stabilized by integration into a chromosome, probably at a different location to that of its unamplified allele.\r"

To assess directly the role of these RR1 protein sequences in cell transformation, the Pst I-C fragment was cloned in an expression vector (p91023) containing an adenovirus-simian virus 40 promoter-enhancer to generate recombinant plasmid p9-C. Expression of a protein domain (approximately 65 kDa) was observed in p9-C-transfected COS-7 and Rat2 cells but not in those transfected with plasmid pHC-14 (Pst I-C in a promoterless vector). In Rat2 cells, p9-C induced highly transformed foci at an elevated frequency compared with that of pHC-14. Introduction of translation termination (TAG) condons within the RR1 coding sequence and within all three reading frames inactivated RR1 protein expression from p9-C and reduced its transforming activity to the level seen with the standard pHC-14 construct. Wild-type p9-C specified a protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation. Computer-assisted analysis further revealed significant similarity between regions of mtrIII-specific RR1 and amino acid patterns conserved within the proinsulin precursor family and DNA transposition proteins. These results identify a distinct domain of the HSV-2 RR1 protein involved in the induction of enhanced malignant transformation. In addition, the data indicate that the mtrIII DNA itself can induce basal-level transformation in the absence of protein expression.\r"

  ".W": "The cytochrome b6/f complex operates in photosynthetic electron transfer either in linear electron flow from photosystem II to photosystem I or in cyclic flow around photosystem I. Using membrane fractionation and immunocytochemistry, we show a change in lateral distribution of cytochrome b6/f complexes along the thylakoid membranes during state transitions. This change is seen in maize as well as in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When either of the two organisms were adapted to state II in vivo, the proportion of cytochrome b6/f complexes found in the photosystem I-enriched stroma lamellae regions was significantly larger than after adaptation to state I. A similar observation was made upon state I to state II transitions done in vitro by illuminating, in the presence of ATP, broken maize chloroplasts prepared from dark-adapted leaves. This reorganization of the electron-transfer chain is concurrent with the change in light-energy distribution between the two photosystems, which requires lateral displacement of light-harvesting complex II. That the changes in lateral distribution of both cytochrome b6/f and light-harvesting II complexes seen upon state transition in vitro similarly required addition of exogenous ATP, suggests that the change in cytochrome b6/f organization also depends on kinase activity. The increased concentration of cytochrome b6/f complexes in the vicinity of photosystem I in state II is discussed in terms of an increase in cyclic electron flow, thus favoring ATP production. Because transition to state II can be triggered in vivo by ATP depletion, we conclude that state transitions should be regarded not only as a light-adaptation mechanism but also as a rerouting of photosynthetic electron flow, enabling photosynthetic organisms to adapt to changes in the cell demand for ATP.\r"

RAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma are encoded by three genes from which multiple isoforms can be generated. Recent studies suggest that the expression of at least some RAR isoforms can be regulated by retinoic acid in certain cell lines. Here we examined regulation of RAR expression in the adult animal. RARs were analyzed by Northern blots from lung, liver, and testes of retinol-deficient rats. Retinol deficiency caused a 65-70% decrease in the mRNA levels of lung and liver RAR-beta, whereas no change was observed in RAR-alpha and -gamma mRNA levels in these organs. In the testes of retinol-deficient animals, two transcripts, RAR-alpha 1 (3.7 kb) and RAR-alpha 2 (2.8 kb), were detected as compared with one RAR-alpha 1 (3.7 kb) transcript in retinol-sufficient testes. When retinol-deficient rats were orally administered 1 dose of retinoic acid (100 micrograms per rat), lung RAR-beta mRNA levels started to increase after 1 hr and reached a 16-fold higher level after 4 hr; after 4 hr these retinoic acid-fed rats also showed a 7-fold increase in liver RAR-beta mRNA levels as compared with levels in the retinol-deficient rats. In contrast, liver, lung, and testes RAR-alpha transcripts remained either unchanged or showed only a slight increase in response to retinoic acid. RAR-gamma was constitutively expressed in lung, and its mRNA levels were induced 2-fold by retinoic acid. These results show tissue diversity in the rapid induction of RAR-beta and RAR-gamma by retinoic acid in the adult animal and suggest distinct roles for the various receptor isoforms in the control of the retinoid response.\r"

However, premature growth arrest at cranial vault sutures in animals appears to play a causative role in the development of cranial deformities characteristic of single-suture, or simple, craniosynostosis in humans. To study the possible causative role of cranial vault and other (interface) suture stenoses on the development of craniofacial deformity, a vault suture and an interface suture between the cranial vault and facial skeleton were simultaneously immobilized. Thirty-one New Zealand White rabbits at 9 days of age underwent implantation of dental amalgam growth markers adjacent to cranial vault and facial sutures. In the experimental group (n = 15), methylcyanoacrylate adhesive was applied over the coronal (vault) and frontonasal (interface suture between vault and facial skeleton) sutures to immobilize them. The remaining 16 animals served as sham-treated controls. All animals underwent serial radiographic cephalometry to document growth effects in the cranial vault, cranial base, and facial skeleton. Application of adhesive resulted in statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in growth at the coronal and frontonasal sutures. This was accompanied by an overall significant reduction in neurocranial vault length during the first 30 days of development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Improvements in the quality of the latter are possible with a systematic approach to shaping the bone graft. Important elements in this approach have been defined based on experience in 50 consecutive cases. Preoperative studies include the lateral cephalogram and a transverse plane CT scan from which mandible templates are constructed. These templates are models of the mandible in two planes and are used to shape the bone with a high degree of precision. They allow the bone to be completely shaped while still attached by the pedicle at the donor site. The surgical specimen serves as an additional key visual reference and as a source of measurements to determine overall bone-graft length. Miniplates alone provide sufficient fixation to stabilize the bone as it is shaped segment by segment. Intermaxillary fixation is used only to prevent errors in total bone-graft length. Hemimandible and anterior defects represent two completely different bone-shaping problems. Although the bone-shaping methods described have been developed primarily with the fibula, they have been successfully applied to the scapula and radius donor sites as well.\r"

A recently developed alternative to bony reconstruction has been the use of the AO reconstruction plate. We compared the use of the AO reconstruction plate with immediate free bone graft mandibular reconstruction in 31 patients. Reconstruction plates were used in 20 and immediate free bone grafts were used in 11 patients. The overall success rate for use of the plate was 15 of 20 (75 percent). There were 6 anterior reconstructions, of which only 2 (33 percent) were successful. This is opposed to 13 of 14 (93 percent) lateral reconstructions that were successful in lateral plate placements. There were 11 immediate composite free flaps: 4 iliac crest, 4 scapula, 2 fibula, and 1 composite radial forearm flaps. Six repairs were for anterior defects, and there were 5 full-thickness defects, 3 of which were in the anterior position. All 11 flaps were successful. In conclusion, we believe the reconstruction plates are a useful adjunct for mandibular replacement in the head and neck cancer patient but should be reserved for lateral defects. For anterior reconstructions, even in patients with locally advanced disease, free-tissue transfer of composite osteocutaneous flaps is the reconstructive method of choice.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews the senior author's long-term experience with the surgical-psychiatric treatment of 100 aesthetic surgery patients with significant psychological disturbances. Patients with psychological disturbances of a magnitude generally considered an \"absolute contraindication\" for surgery were operated on and later assessed to determine the psychological impact of surgery. Patient follow-up averaged 6.2 years (maximum follow-up 25.7 years). Of the 87 patients who underwent operation (7 patients were refused surgery and 6 voluntarily deferred surgery), 82.8 percent had a positive psychological outcome, 13.8 percent experienced \"minimal\" improvement from surgery, and 3.4 percent were negatively affected by surgery. There were no lawsuits, suicides, or psychotic decompensations. Patients with severe psychological disturbances frequently benefited from combined surgical-psychiatric treatment designed to address the patient's profound sense of deformity. This study suggests that plastic surgeons are \"passing up\" a significant number of patients who may be helped by combined surgical-psychological intervention.\r"

Both superolateral and inferolateral orbital margins are released by means of a single burr hole craniectomy of the frontosphenoid bone behind the orbital process of the frontal bone. Vertical and horizontal marginal lengthenings are performed by a rotatory displacement of one bone segment alongside the other. The expanded osseous aperture is secured with wire and plate-and-screw fixation following a supraorbital rim craniectomy to allow an adequate fit. The result provides for easier access of ocular prostheses and tissue expanders. The method has been applied to a series of patients with microorbitalism due to unilateral or bilateral congenital anophthalmia over the past 3 years without complication and with excellent results. Three-dimensional re-formatted CT reconstructions of the craniofacial skeleton are shown preoperatively and postoperatively.\r"

A free tongue graft was utilized seven times in six patients (19 percent). Indications for its use were a V-shaped vermilion deficit or a \"whistling\" deformity associated with a sagittal vermilion deficiency and normal or insufficient lateral vermilion bulk. Of the seven free tongue grafts, none was lost. Three patients have required revisions, including repeat free tongue graft in one. Proper positioning of the graft along the free vermilion border has made color and texture match satisfactory. The free tongue graft is a simple and reliable means of transferring both vermilion bulk and surface mucosa. Introduction of the free tongue graft has eliminated the need for more cumbersome procedures, such as the Abbe flap or the tongue flap, in properly selected patients.\r"

Intervals of 3 weeks separate the surgical procedures. Using this strategy, essentially normal lip function and a relatively normal appearance have been obtained in four patients with large lip defects.\r"

The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders. There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants. Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed. It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of \"complete muscle coverage.\" It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection. Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed.\r"

This TRAM flap model was based on the deep inferior epigastric vascular pedicle, with the center of the transverse skin paddle attached to the underlying rectus abdominis muscle at the superior end of the muscle and extending bilaterally from its attached muscle. The transverse skin paddle (8 x 30 cm) included a contralateral and ipsilateral random portion of skin. This flap model was based on the deep inferior epigastric rather than the superior epigastric vascular pedicle because the deep inferior epigastric vascular pedicle is the smaller of the two in the pig and augmentation of its blood supply by ligation of the dominant superior epigastric vascular pedicle resembles more closely the clinical situation. It was observed that ligation of the dominant superior epigastric vascular pedicle 14 days prior to raising the TRAM flap significantly (p less than 0.05; n = 5) increased the total muscle and skin capillary blood flow and skin viability in the transverse skin paddle compared with the sham-operated control (n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a second operation, island buttock flaps were elevated bilaterally. Flap temperature, laser Doppler flow (LDF), and fluorescein penetration borders were recorded. Norepinephrine infusions were given twice. After cannulation of the external iliac veins, the total venous outflow from the flaps and metabolic parameters such as glucose and oxygen consumption and lactate production were measured bilaterally. No significant difference in fluorescein staining was found, but laser Doppler flow in the expanded tissue was higher than in nonexpanded skin, whereas the total flap blood flow was not significantly different. A flow reduction was seen in expanded flaps during norepinephrine infusion, whereas nonexpanded flaps showed a slightly increased blood flow. This adrenergic supersensitivity indicates that it is possible that not only surgical nerve section but also tissue expansion can result in sympathetic denervation. No differences in the metabolic parameters were observed.\r"

The method has been modified to allow blood flow measurements in skin, but the accuracy of H2 clearance for measuring skin blood flow has not been determined. Multiple blood flow measurements were performed using H2 clearance and radioactive microspheres on skin flaps and control skin in pigs. On 12 pigs, a total of 117 flap and 42 control skin measurements were available for analysis. There was no significant difference between the two techniques in measuring mean control skin blood flow. In skin flaps, H2 clearance was significantly correlated to microsphere-measured blood flow, but it consistently gave an overestimate. Sources of error may include injury to the tissues by insertion of electrodes, consumption of H2 by the electrodes, or diffusion of H2 from the relatively ischemic flap to its well-vascularized bed. Further studies are necessary to determine the cause of this error and to measure the technique's accuracy in skeletal muscle and other flaps.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral denervated myocutaneous island flaps based on the superior epigastric vessels were raised in 24 pigs and the metabolic changes during the first 6 postoperative hours were monitored. Secondary to flap elevation, decreased arteriovenous (A-V) differences in oxygen, glucose, and alanine levels were observed, indicating the opening of A-V shunts and increased arterialization of the venous blood. Venous outflow increased during the first 3 hours, but the A-V differences in all metabolites were constant over the entire 6-hour observation period. Exchange of intermediary metabolites therefore increased within the first 3 hours, after which a steady state was established. The main flap fuels seemed to be fatty acids, muscle proteins, and glycogen, whereas blood-borne carbohydrates and ketone bodies played only a minor role as energy sources. Anaerobic metabolism was increased secondary to flap elevation from 2 to 6 percent as compared with preelevation values. No changes were found in concentrations of plasma catecholamines, which were constantly high. An average weight gain of 3 to 4 percent per hour was equally distributed to skin, subcutis, panniculus carnosus, and muscle. Thus the flap seemed to adapt to the new perfusion pattern within a few hours by a slightly increased anaerobic metabolism, but still with an oxidative metabolism of more than 90 percent.\r"

In order to test this clinically observed phenomenon, a musculocutaneous flap model based on perforators from the rat rectus abdominis muscle was developed and observed to have complete reliability. Groups of five Sprague-Dawley rats each were sequentially utilized to prove that by a single week following creation of a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap adequate peripheral neovascularization would evolve to permit total viability of secondary axial epigastric cutaneous flaps incorporating the same skin that initially was the cutaneous portion of the muscle flap. The converse was also confirmed possible, again using sequential groups of five rats each, in that by 2 weeks the skin of an initial abdominal cutaneous flap could instead be safely transposed and nourished as part of a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap. The proposition concerning the reliable reuse of identical skin territories as part of disparate metachronous flap configurations appears to be valid.\r"

We present 27 patients who had recalcitrant, noncollapsible wounds of the hip that were present for many months to years. Twenty-eight cases of infected total-hip arthroplasties that did not respond to removal of the prosthesis and cement and closure were seen by the authors between January of 1977 and December of 1988. One patient had bilateral involvement. Average age was 64 years (range 33 to 79 years). There was an average of 4.2 previous surgical attempts at closure (range 1 to 21). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, but the infections were virtually all multiple. Thirty-three muscles were utilized in 27 patients. The rectus femoris was used in 23 cases, the vastus lateralis in 8, tensor fasciae latae in 1, and combined latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior free-tissue transfers were carried out in 2. Multiple combinations of transpositions and free flaps were utilized. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 10 years, with an average of 6.4 years. Eighteen patients were ambulatory with minor degrees of pain, five ambulated with a cane, seven ambulated with a walker, six ambulated with crutches, and four ambulated unassisted, all of whom had reimplantation of their hip arthroplasty at least 12 months following the muscle flap procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A significant difference between male and female rats above 400 gm also was noted. For a localized injury (sciatic nerve cut), this approach demonstrated that the contralateral hind footprint was a \"compensated\" rather than a normal track. This approach to track analysis also was capable of demonstrating progressive neurologic impairment for a sciatic nerve compression model and a systemic disease such as diabetes, as well as demonstrating reversal of these abnormal patterns when the \"disease state\" was treated.\r"

Research into increasing our understanding of the optical characteristics of skin has made it possible to concentrate not on the effects of any particular laser system, but on basic biologic and physical principles of laser-tissue interaction. The lasers available in the 1960s and 1970s offered few possibilities for modification. However, modern technology allows us to manipulate the physical characteristics of lasers and design them for specific therapeutic purposes. Selective photothermolysis relies on chromophore-specific absorption of a brief pulse of light to generate and confine heat to certain targets within the skin without nonspecific thermal damage to adjacent structures. Thermally mediated target alterations can be confined from the level of large multicellular tissue structures (e.g., blood vessels) to individual microscopic pigmented structures (e.g., tattoo pigment granules). The purpose of this report is to describe the current progress being made and to summarize the present theories for achieving increasing selective removal, without scarring or other skin textural changes, of cutaneous vasculopathies and tattoo pigment by pulsed laser.\r"

Since its first discovery in 1975, the pest has been captured in the Los Angeles Basin in nine separate years including every year from 1986 through 1990. The trend has become distinct--the intervals between captures are decreasing, the numbers captured are increasing, and the area over which they are detected is expanding. In addition, appearances are seasonal and captures in recent years have occurred in many of the same cities and neighborhoods where medflies were found several years before. Evidence suggests that the medfly may be established in the Los Angeles area and that previous eradication programs did not eradicate the medfly from California. It follows that detection, exclusion, and eradication protocols may need to be reexamined.\r"

This neural system consists of the hippocampus and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. These structures, presumably by virtue of their widespread and reciprocal connections with neocortex, are essential for establishing long-term memory for facts and events (declarative memory). The medial temporal lobe memory system is needed to bind together the distributed storage sites in neocortex that represent a whole memory. However, the role of this system is only temporary. As time passes after learning, memory stored in neocortex gradually becomes independent of medial temporal lobe structures.\r"

Previous studies led to the conclusion that nonnative states are well populated in the oxidative folding of BPTI. This conclusion has broadly influenced efforts to understand protein folding. The population of intermediates present during the folding of BPTI has been reexamined by modern separation techniques. It was found that all well-populated folding intermediates contain only native disulfide bonds. These data emphasize the importance of native protein structure for understanding protein folding.\r"

Fourteen of the seventeen clones selected contained stretches of pyrimidines highly homologous to the target DNA sequence (T.AT and C+.GC). In addition, these RNA molecules contained hairpin loops, interior loops, and nonstandard base triplets [C+(or C).AT, U.GC, G.GC, and A.AT] at various positions. Affinity cleavage experiments confirmed the ability of selected sequences to bind specifically to the target DNA. Systematic variation in both the target DNA sequence and buffer components should provide increased insight into the molecular interactions required for triple-helix-mediated recognition of natural DNA.\r"
