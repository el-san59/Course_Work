Normal rat and human SCs in vitro expressed low levels of class I MHC, but this was markedly increased by incubation with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Untreated SCs of rat or human origin did not express detectable class II MHC molecules, but after 48 hours incubation with IFN-gamma 100 U/ml, 20% of rat SCs and 90% of human SCs were class II positive. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the surface expression of MHC molecules on SCs and demonstrated class II MHC within endocytotic vesicles. These findings provide further evidence for an immunological role for SCs as antigen presenting cells or as targets for cytotoxic T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Zidovudine (AZT) is a potent inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has been shown to improve survival in advanced HIV disease. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in adults with asymptomatic HIV infection who had CD4+ cell counts of fewer than 500 per cubic millimeter on entry into the study. The subjects (92 percent male) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo (428 subjects); zidovudine, 500 mg per day (453); or zidovudine, 1500 mg per day (457). After a mean follow-up of 55 weeks (range, 19 to 107), 33 of the subjects assigned to placebo had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as compared with 11 of those assigned to receive 500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.002; relative risk, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.6) and 14 of those assigned to receive 1500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.05; relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5). In the three treatment groups, the rates of progression (per 100 person-years) to either AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex were 7.6, 3.6, and 4.3, respectively. As compared with those assigned to placebo, the subjects in the zidovudine groups had significant increases in the number of CD4+ cells and significant declines in p24 antigen levels. In the 1500-mg zidovudine group, severe hematologic toxicity (anemia or neutropenia) was more frequent than in the other groups (P less than 0.0001). In the 500-mg zidovudine group, nausea was the only toxicity that was significantly more frequent (in 3.3 percent) than in the placebo group (P = 0.001). We conclude that zidovudine is safe and effective in persons with asymptomatic HIV infection and fewer than 500 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter. Additional study will be required to determine whether such treatment will ultimately improve survival for persons infected with HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide, acting through its second messenger guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), suppresses Na+ absorption across the renal inner-medullary collecting duct and increases urinary Na+ excretion. Patch clamp studies show that cGMP reduces Na+ absorption by inhibiting an amiloride-sensitive cation channel in the apical membrane. We have now examined, using the patch clamp technique, the molecular mechanisms of cGMP inhibition. Cyclic GMP directly and specifically reduced the probability of a single channel being open (open probability, Po) by 39% (inhibition constant, Ki = 7.6 x 10(-7) M) by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Cyclic GMP also inhibited the channel by activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP-kinase). Exogenous cGMP-kinase completely inhibited the channel by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein by GTP-gamma-S blocked cGMP-kinase inhibition of the channel. By contrast, cGMP-kinase inhibition of Po was completely reversed by GTP-gamma-S. Taken together with the results of a previous study showing that a G protein activates the cation channel, these data indicate that cGMP-kinase and a G protein sequentially regulate the cation channel. Our results show that atrial natriuretic peptide, acting through cGMP, inhibits Na+ absorption across the inner-medullary collecting duct by a dual mechanism, and that cGMP-kinase inhibits the channel by a pathway involving a G protein.\r"

Of the DGK isoforms so far reported, only porcine DGK from lymphocytes has been characterized in detail. Here we report the isolation and sequencing of complementary DNA clones that together cover the entire region encoding porcine DGK (relative molecular mass 80,000 (80K)). The deduced primary structure of this DGK contains the putative ATP-binding sites, two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like sequences similar to those found in protein kinase C, and two E-F hand motifs, typical of Ca2(+)-binding proteins like calmodulin. Indeed, we find that the activity of this DGK isoform is enhanced by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ in the presence of deoxycholate or sphingosine. These properties of 80K DGK indicate that its action is probably linked with both of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.\r"

But the signal(s) that activates the ras pathway(s) is not known. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CDC25 gene product acts upstream of Ras proteins, but it has not been clear whether CDC25 function is unique to the S. cerevisiae ras pathway. Here we report that the ste6 gene of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a homologue of CDC25: the ste6 gene product and the CDC25 gene product have significant amino-acid similarity in their C-terminal regions. Like the S. pombe ras1 gene, ste6 is essential for mating. Epistatic interactions indicate that the ste6 gene functions upstream of ras1. We propose that ste6 and CDC25 activate Ras protein through a common mechanism, perhaps by promoting GDP-GTP exchange, even though it seems that the function of Ras protein in budding yeast differs from that in fission yeast. Homologues of ste6 and CDC25 could regulate ras activity in other eukaryotic cells.\r"

The highest titer of infectious material and the greatest concentration of PrP33-35Sc were in the fractions containing microsomal and synaptosomal membranes. We found traces of infectivity in the absence of PrP33-35Sc associated with matrix protein. Partitioning of membranes with neutral chloroform-methanol resulted in concentration of PrP33-35Sc and infectivity within the interphase layer. Recombination of membrane glycoproteins (interphase) with lipids extracted from homologous brains decreased infectivity greater than or equal to 4 logs. Temperature-dependent phase separation of infected synaptosomal and microsomal membranes with Triton X-114 yielded a phospholipid-rich phase containing a high concentration of PrP33-35Sc and greatest infectivity titers. This material spontaneously formed liposomes, indicating that PrP33-35Sc and PrP33-35C precursor proteins are highly hydrophobic intrinsic membrane components integrated with phospholipids. Homologous membrane phospholipids appear to prevent aggregation of the scrapie isoform of PrP and maintain high levels of infectivity.\r"

Polyclonal antibodies raised against mouse and hamster PrP27-30 and against a synthetic peptide of the N-terminal sequence of this protein were used as immunologic probes. PrP27-30 purified as a primary immunogen corresponded to the lower molecular mass peptide, with Mr between 9.3 and 13.5 kd as estimated by size-exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography. ELISA and immunoblot techniques demonstrated that antibodies recognized homologous antigens as well as precursor proteins from brains (PrP33-35C) and the scrapie isoform of scrapie-associated proteins (PrP33-35Sc/CJD and PrP27-30) from scrapie- and CJD-infected brains. The normal, scrapie, and CJD isoforms of scrapie-associated proteins share common epitopes with varying degrees of interspecies homology. Specific antigen detected in neurons indicated that these proteins are synthesized primarily in these cells. In infected brains, extracellular amyloid deposits formed by the scrapie isoform of PrP protein also strongly reacted with anti-PrP antibodies.\r"

Antibodies raised against a 15-amino-acid synthetic peptide of the N-terminal of hamster PrP27-30 displayed a similar pattern of staining in mouse brain sections. We observed no intracellular staining in human brain sections obtained at autopsy.

During cesarean, the period of interruption of utero-placental blood flow is extended as the time interval from uterine incision to delivery increases. An increasing uterine incision-to-delivery interval with spinal or general anesthesia has been associated with a poorer neonatal outcome. This association has not been demonstrated previously in patients undergoing cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia. We investigated the correlation between prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery intervals, fetal catecholamine concentrations, and fetal blood gas values at delivery in 25 parturients undergoing cesarean under epidural anesthesia and in 28 under spinal anesthesia. Infants delivered after prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery intervals had significantly lower pH values in both the epidural and spinal groups. With longer uterine incision-to-delivery intervals, umbilical arterial norepinephrine concentrations were increased significantly. Umbilical arterial pH values were significantly lower in infants with higher umbilical arterial catecholamine concentrations. The importance of minimizing the uterine incision-to-delivery interval, regardless of the type of anesthetic selected, is demonstrated.\r"

Fourteen women with one or more abnormal pregnancy outcomes (total 28 losses, one severely growth-retarded premature live-born) and no normal outcomes were treated with full-dose, subcutaneous, twice-daily heparin therapy in subsequent pregnancies. Treatment was started at an estimated gestational age of 10.3 +/- 4.0 (mean +/- SD) weeks (range 6-18), in a mean total daily dosage of 24,700 +/- 7400 units (range 10,000-36,000). Fourteen of 15 pregnancies resulted in live births at 36.1 +/- 1.7 weeks (range 33-39). The mean birth weight percentile was 57 +/- 21 (range 10-90), and Apgar scores were good to excellent. The number of placental infarcts was fewer in treated cases than in previous deliveries. Five fetuses had third-trimester or perinatal problems with no sequelae, four discovered by close maternal-fetal monitoring. There was an increased rate of preterm and cesarean deliveries. Maternal complications of treatment were few and minor, with no hypertension, preeclampsia, or serious drug-related complications. Heparin appears suitable for further investigation in the treatment of this obstetric syndrome.\r"

In an attempt to optimize this form of therapy, we treated eight women with endometriosis with daily subcutaneous injections of a potent agonist of GnRH plus a daily oral dose of 20-30 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate for 24 weeks. Ovarian estrogen secretion was reduced to levels seen in castrated women throughout the course of treatment. Markers of hypoestrogenism, such as hot flashes and loss of calcium from bone, were diminished with this regimen compared with previous findings with GnRH agonist alone. Blinded evaluation of laparoscopic photographs failed to reveal improvement or suppression of active endometriosis. The results of this pilot study indicate that the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases the hypoestrogenic effects of GnRH agonist alone but fails to affect pain or endometriotic implants.\r"

No difference was found in 3H-thymidine incorporation by cells incubated in either CSM-dextran medium or CSM medium alone. Subsequently, 21 pairs of corneas, stored in either CSM or CSM-dextran from 30 to 112 hours, were transplanted into 42 eyes of 42 patients, paired by diagnostic group and procedure. All CSM grafts and 19 of 21 CSM-dextran grafts were clear at 4 months with no primary donor failures in either group. Intraoperative corneal thickness was significantly greater in the CSM group (0.82 +/- 0.07 mm) than the CSM-dextran group (0.76 +/- 0.06 mm); however, the two groups did not differ thereafter. No differences in all endothelial morphometric parameters were noted between the two groups pre- and postoperatively. Average endothelial cell loss by 4 months was 13.0 +/- 16.4% for the CSM group and 16.4 +/- 15.5% for the CSM-dextran group. The addition of dextran to CSM medium results in significant intraoperative corneal thinning without adversely affecting endothelial DNA synthesis in vitro and endothelial survival in vivo.\r"

Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. Bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/mL in all but one of the positive cultures. No anaerobic bacteria were isolated. History of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum IgE were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. Serum levels of IgG2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low IgG2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. We concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.\r"

In addition to meningitis, H. influenzae type b is responsible for other invasive infections, including epiglottitis, septicemia, cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, and otitis media; approximately 30,000 cases H influenzae diseases occur annually in the United States. The diseases peak in incidence between 6 and 12 months of age, with almost one half of the cases occurring before 1 year of age. About 75% of disease caused by H influenzae type b occurs in children younger than 24 months old. The incidence of disease is higher in children of certain groups, including blacks, Hispanics, Eskimos and Native Americans, young children attending day-care facilities, patients with asplenia or antibody-deficiency syndromes, and children of lower socioeconomic status.

The public health impact of morbidity, mortality, and serious sequelae from disease caused by H influenzae type b has stimulated the search for control strategies. In the United States now, active immunoprophylaxis is largely favored over treatment of prophylaxis with antibiotics. This preference stems from three major observations: that high mortality and morbidity persist despite the availability of potent antimicrobial agents, that antibiotic-resistant strains of H influenzae type b have emerged, and that implementation of antimicrobial prophylaxis on a large scale has been unsatisfactory. Moreover, universal vaccination has been projected as offering a higher economic benefit than other control strategies. A matter of more proximate importance, however, is the search for H influenzae type b vaccines that will confer protection to all age groups, including infants younger than 18 months of age and subpopulations specifically at risk for invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b. Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate), PedvaxHIB (PRP-OMPC), is a conjugate H influenzae type b vaccine developed at Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories that now is undergoing extensive clinical evaluation to assess its prospects for disease control when first administered in early infancy. This is an interim report of results obtained in studies conducted in diverse locations throughout the United States.\r"

In an effort to enhance the immunogenicity of H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine for children in the most susceptible age groups, conjugate vaccines have been developed in which the capsular PRP of H influenzae type b has been bound to a variety of carrier proteins, thereby conferring the vaccines with thymic-dependent attributes. One such conjugate vaccine, in which the carrier protein is diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D), was licensed in 1987 and has been recommended since 1988 for routine use in children 18 months of age and older. A second conjugate vaccine, in which an oligosaccharide derivative of H influenzae type b capsular PRP is coupled to CRM, a nontoxic mutant diphtheria toxin (oligo-CRM), was licensed in 1988 and is a sanctioned alternative to PRP-D. Another investigational conjugate vaccine, in which the polysaccharide is linked to the outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis group B (PRP-OMPC), has been demonstrated to be both safe and immunogenic when administered in a two-dose schedule to 2- to 6-month-old infants. However, anti-PRP antibody levels decline significantly during the ensuing 10 to 15 months; they rise significantly in response to booster doses of either PRP or PRP-OMPC administered 10 to 15 months after the initial priming doses of PRP-OMPC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, a wide range of estimates of vaccine efficacy has been reported in the United States after its licensure in 1985. These estimates range from -55% to +89%. In addition, the PRP vaccine was not effective in children younger than 18 months of age, in whom 70% to 80% of meningitis cases occur. A further development was the introduction of H influenzae type b polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines such as the PRP-D. These conjugate vaccines were found to be more immunogenic than PRP vaccine in children of all ages. Two doses of PRP-D in infants 7 months of age and older induced antibody levels equal to or greater than levels in infants 24 months of age who received the PRP vaccine alone. Recently, Eskola et al reported that repeat vaccinations with PRP-D at 3, 4, 6, and 14 months of age was 83% protective (95% confidence interval, 26% to 96%). Yet PRP-D vaccine elicits only low serum antibody levels in infants younger than 7 months of age. Because of the discrepancy in efficacy results for the PRP vaccine in the United States and Finland and the lack of data about the protective efficacy of PRP-D vaccine in infants in the United States, the PRP-D vaccine is currently recommended only for children 18 months of age or older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an effort to enhance immunogenicity, PRP has been coupled to various carrier proteins and to an outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) from Neisseria meningitidis group B. The latter approach has yielded a vaccine that elicits a good antibody response after a single 15-micrograms dose of vaccine in infants as young as 2 months of age, as measured by radioimmunoassay and immune bacteriolysis. In this report we describe the results of a pilot study using this H influenzae type B conjugate vaccine, PedvaxHIB, in children from 2 months to 4 years of age. Three different vaccine lots were examined for consistency of response. Sera were measured for antibody levels by radioimmunoassay and for functional activity using an opsonophagocytic assay using human adult neutrophils. These assays correlated well and demonstrated the excellent immune response and biologic activity of sera from infants vaccinated with this unique H influenzae type B conjugate vaccine.\r"

These vaccines have consisted of purified polyribosylribitol-phosphate (PRP), the capsular polysaccharide of H influenzae type b, alone or covalently bound to one of several carrier proteins. Two of these saccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are now licensed, a polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate (PRP-D) and an oligosaccharide-mutant diphtheria toxin conjugate (HbOC). Two others, a polysaccharide-Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein conjugate (PRP-OMPC) and a polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), are currently in clinical trials. One concern with the use of PRP vaccine was the suggestion that the incidence of invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b in the immediate period after immunization might be increased; this idea was supported by evidence from several sources. In a case-control study of the efficacy of PRP vaccine, Black et al found that 4 children were hospitalized for invasive disease within 1 week of immunization, a rate of invasive disease 6.4 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 19.2) than the background rate in unvaccinated children. In Minnesota, the relative risk for invasive disease in the first week after immunization was 6.2 (95% CI, 0.6 to 45.9), and the results of a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control in six areas of the United States revealed a 1.8-fold (95% CI, 0.3 to 10.2) increase in the occurrence of invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b in the first week after immunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These two strains showed only minor differences when penetration, excretion, tissue sequestration, or metabolism of [3H]JH III was measured. In contrast, when we examined JH III binding by a cytosolic binding protein from a JH target tissue, Met strains had a 10-fold lower binding affinity than did Met+ strains. Studies using deficiency-bearing chromosomes provide strong evidence that the Met locus controls the binding protein characteristics and may encode the protein. These studies indicate that resistance in Met flies results from reduced binding affinity of a cytosolic binding protein for JH III.\r"

  ".U": "90192750\r", 
  ".W": "The DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor GAL4, consisting of the 62 N-terminal residues and denoted GAL4(62*), contains a Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6+ ++-Cys motif, which has been shown previously to bind two Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions. Binding of Zn(II) or Cd(II) is essential for the recognition by GAL4 of the specific palindromic DNA sequence to which it binds upstream of genes for galactose-metabolizing enzymes, the UASG sequence. On the basis of the 113Cd NMR chemical shifts of the two bound 113Cd(II) ions, we propose a binuclear cluster model for this Zn(II)-binding subdomain. 1H-113Cd heteronuclear multiple-quantum NMR spectroscopy and phase-sensitive double-quantum filtered 1H correlation spectroscopy of the 112Cd(II)- and 113Cd(II)-substituted GAL4(62*) derivatives provide direct evidence that the two bound 113Cd(II) ions are coordinated only by the six cysteine residues, two of which form bridging ligands between the two 113Cd(II) ions. The latter can be identified from the pattern of 1H-113Cd J coupling. Thus a binuclear metal ion cluster rather than a \"zinc finger\" is formed by the six cysteine residues of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. This model can be directly applied to eight other fungal transcription factors which have been shown to contain similarly spaced Cys6 clusters. 1H NMR spectra of apo-GAL4(62*) suggest conformational fluctuation of the metal-binding subdomain upon removal of Zn(II) or Cd(II). Both Cd(II)2- and Zn(II)2-containing species of GAL4 can be formed, and the similar 1H NMR spectra suggest similar conformations.\r"

  ".W": "Hemophilia A results from mutations in the gene coding for coagulation factor VIII. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to screen for mutations in the region of the factor VIII gene coding for the first acidic domain. Amplification primers were designed employing the MELTMAP computer program to optimize the ability to detect mutations. Screening of amplified DNA from 228 unselected hemophilia A patients revealed two mutations and one polymorphism. Rescreening the same population by making heteroduplexes between amplified patient and control samples prior to electrophoresis revealed one additional mutation. The mutations include two missense and one 4-base-pair deletion, and each mutation was found in patients with severe hemophilia. The polymorphism, located adjacent to the adenine branch site in intron 7, is useful for genetic prediction in some cases where the Bcl I and Xba I polymorphisms are uninformative. These results suggest that DNA amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis should be an excellent strategy for identifying mutations and polymorphisms in defined regions of the factor VIII gene and other large genes.\r"

Genetic evidence suggests that trx may be considered a positive regulator of homeotic genes. Sequencing of cDNAs corresponding to the entire trx transcription unit revealed the existence of an unusually long open reading frame encoding 3759 amino acids. The main features of the predicted trx protein are several cysteine-rich regions which can be folded into zinc finger-like domains. Cysteine-rich portions expressed from trx cDNAs in Escherichia coli are capable of zinc binding in vitro, suggesting a possible function for the trx product as a metal-dependent DNA-binding protein. Analysis of trx mutant embryos with antibody to the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene product showed decreased staining in parasegment 6 of the ventral nerve cord of late embryos. However, expression of Ubx was not affected in embryos carrying the lethal mutation trxE3, in which one of the putative zinc finger-like domains of the trx protein is deleted. This differential effect of the E3 mutation suggests that trx exhibits other function(s) besides those involved in the regulation of Ubx expression in the ventral nerve cord of the embryo.\r"

Using Bufo marinus isolated retinas and K(+)-selective microelectrodes, we recorded two distinct light-evoked increases in extracellular K+ concentration: one in the inner plexiform layer and the other near the outer plexiform layer; the \"distal\" K+ increase was found over only 10-microns depth and had a maximum amplitude of 0.3 mM. We also recorded the electroretinogram and the light-evoked responses of rods and Muller cells. After correction for the response time of the K(+)-selective microelectrode, the waveforms of all three of these responses were almost exactly as predicted by an earlier computer simulation of the K+/Muller cell hypothesis of the b-wave by Newman and Odette [Newman, E.A. & Odette, L.L. (1984) J. Neurophysiol. 51, 164-182]. The distal K+ increase and the b-wave varied in a similar manner as a function of stimulus irradiance. Superfusion with 0.2 mM Ba2+ attenuated both the Muller cell depolarization and the b-wave by approximately 65% but had no significant effect upon the distal K+ increase. Because Ba2+ reduces K+ conductance of Muller cells, these results are very strong support of the K+/Muller cell hypothesis of the origin of the electroretinogram b-wave; the light-evoked increase in extracellular potassium concentration still is present during superfusion with Ba2+, but the K(+)-evoked Muller cell depolarization and the b-wave are decreased in amplitude because Muller cell K+ conductance is reduced.\r"

  ".U": "90192762\r", 
  ".W": "The CD8 molecule on class I-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is believed to function as a coreceptor along with the alpha beta T-cell receptor. Whereas the alpha beta T-cell receptor recognizes polymorphic residues in the alpha 1/alpha 2 domains of the class I molecule, the CD8 molecule is believed to recognize monomorphic class I residues. Our previous experiments suggested that residue 227 in the alpha 3 domain of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules contributes to the determinant recognized by CD8. By using a panel of site-directed mutants of H-2Dd, this observation has been extended herein. Our findings indicate that for recognition by CD8-dependent CTLs, residue 227 must be either glutamic acid or aspartic acid and cannot be either basic or uncharged. However, the recognition by CD8-independent CTLs is unaffected by any of the substitutions at position 227 of H-2Dd. Similarly, alterations of other charged residues at positions 222, 223, and 229 have an analogous effect to substitution at residue 227, whereas substitutions at residues 192 and 232 do not affect the reactivity of CD8-dependent or CD8-independent CTLs. In addition, mutant H-2Dd molecules that are not recognized by CD8-dependent CTLs are unable to stimulate a primary CTL response, yet they can stimulate a secondary CD8-independent H-2Dd-specific CTL response. These findings suggest that CD8 recognition is obligatory for the priming of class I-dependent CTL responses. Since endogenous class I molecules were expressed by all of the transfected cell lines, these findings provide direct genetic evidence that CD8 and the alpha beta T-cell receptor must interact with the same class I molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Cyanobacteria harvest light energy through multimolecular structures, the phycobilisomes, regularly arrayed at the surface of the photosynthetic membranes. Phycobilisomes consist of a central core from which rods radiate. A large polypeptide (LCM, 75-120 kDa) is postulated to act both as terminal energy acceptor and as a linker polypeptide that stabilizes the phycobilisome architecture. We report here the characterization of the gene (apcE) that encodes this LCM polypeptide in Calothrix sp. PCC 7601. It is located upstream from the genes encoding the major components of the phycobilisome core (allophycocyanin) and is part of the same operon. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that the N-terminal region of LCM shares homology with the other phycobiliprotein subunits and thus constitutes the chromoprotein domain. The other part of the molecule is made up of four repeated domains that are highly homologous to the N-terminal regions of the phycocyanin rod linker polypeptides. The predicted secondary structure of the different domains of the LCM is discussed in relation to the different roles and properties of this large molecule.\r"

The complex exhibits cellulase activity against crystalline cellulose as well as carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and cellobiohydrolase activities. Three major subunits are present with molecular masses of 170, 100, and 70 kDa. The 100-kDa subunit is the major CMCase, although at least four other, minor subunits show CMCase activity. The 170-kDa subunit has the highest affinity for cellulose, does not have detectable enzymatic activity, but is necessary for cellulase activity. Immunological studies indicate that the 170-kDa subunit is not required for binding of the catalytic subunits to cellulose and therefore does not function solely as an anchor protein. Thus this core subunit must have multiple functions. We propose a working hypothesis that the binding of the 170-kDa subunit converts the crystalline cellulose to a form that is capable of being hydrolyzed in a cooperative fashion by the associated catalytic subunits.\r"

  ".W": "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa proteins that act as GTP-dependent allosteric activators of cholera toxin. With deoxyinosine-containing degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved GTP-binding domains in ARFs, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify simultaneously from human DNA portions of three ARF genes that include codons for 102 amino acids, with intervening sequences. Amplification products that differed in size because of differences in intron sizes were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. One amplified DNA contained no introns and had a sequence different from those of known ARFs. Based on this sequence, selective oligonucleotide probes were prepared and used to isolate clone psi ARF 4, a putative ARF pseudogene, from a human genomic library in lambda phage EMBL3. Reverse transcription-PCR was then used to clone from human poly(A)+ RNA the cDNA corresponding to the expressed homolog of psi ARF 4, referred to as human ARF 4. It appears that psi ARF 4 arose during human evolution by integration of processed ARF 4 mRNA into the genome. Human ARF 4 differs from previously identified mammalian ARFs 1, 2, and 3. Hybridization of ARF 4-specific oligonucleotide probes with human, bovine, and rat RNA revealed a single 1.8-kilobase mRNA, which was clearly distinguished from the 1.9-kilobase mRNA for ARF 1 in these tissues. The PCR provides a powerful tool for investigating diversity in this and other multigene families, especially with primers targeted at domains believed to have functional significance.\r"

Activation of pro-u-PA on the cell surface and consequent binding of PAI-2 was dependent on the addition of native plasminogen to serum cultures of the cells. Inhibition of the enzyme activity of surface-bound u-PA by the added PAI-2 resulted in a 79% reduction in the capacity of the RD cells to generate cell surface-associated plasmin activity from bound plasminogen. Under these conditions, the PAI-2 probe was localized at focal adhesions of RD cells, where it colocalized with both extracellular u-PA and intracellular vinculin antigens in double immunofluorescence labeling. Specificity of the probe's interaction with cell surface-bound u-PA was confirmed by blocking with a monoclonal antibody to human u-PA, which could also inhibit the formation of bound plasmin activity. These results showed the assembly of the plasmin-generating system at focal adhesions and the accessibility of bound u-PA on which it depends to added PAI-2. Therefore, PAI-2 has the potential both to localize at sites of tumor expression of functionally active u-PA and simultaneously to inhibit cell surface plasminogen activation.\r"

We localized distinct beta-APP domains, including the beta-amyloid protein or A4 region, within the SPs of 13 end-stage Alzheimer disease (AD) and 13 age-matched control samples of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The composition of SPs also was probed with antibodies to defined epitopes in tau (tau) as well as the large and mid-size neurofilament (NF) proteins. The most important observations were that beta-APP domains outside the A4 region were largely restricted to SP coronas in the AD samples, together with tau and NF determinants, whereas the same epitopes were absent from A4-positive blood vessels and exceptionally rare in non-AD SPs. Indeed, samples from a subset of the non-AD cases contained a considerable number of A4-positive SPs totally devoid of any of the other beta-APP, tau, and NF epitopes. These observations suggest that the deposition of the A4 protein in AD SPs results from the local processing of beta-APPs in association with tau and NF protein fragments. It is unclear whether this association is fortuitous or linked by common mechanisms. However, differences between the complement of beta-APP, tau, and NF protein epitopes in AD versus non-AD brains implicate a defect involving one or more steps in the posttranslational modification, degradation, or elimination of these proteins in AD brains, and this may account for the massive numbers of SPs that characterize AD.\r"

Their expression is associated with hypomethylation at CpG sites in the 5' long terminal repeat. We have used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to examine patterns of IAP hypomethylation in mouse DNA. The method is sensitive to both the methylation status of a conserved Hae II site in the 5' long terminal repeat and the location of the closest BamHI site in the flanking DNA upstream of each hypomethylated long terminal repeat. The method also defects restriction fragments derived from IAP elements that are themselves methylated but have an unmethylated Hae II site in their 5' adjacent DNA. DNAs from each of four inbred mouse strains (BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6, and DBA/2) gave distinctive two-dimensional patterns of BamHI/Hae II restriction fragments detected by hybridization with an IAP probe. This constitutive pattern was largely conserved among several tissues of each strain, but some tissue-specific variations were observed. The site-specific hypomethylations reflected in the two-dimensional patterns were heritable properties, since DNA from progeny of an interstrain cross contained both parental sets of fragments. IAP elements may be useful endogenous reporters of genomic methylation patterns.\r"

Although multiple distinctive forms of the alpha subunit have been described, only two forms of the beta subunits of the G proteins have been identified. To investigate further the structural diversity of the beta subunits, we screened bovine and human retina cDNA libraries and isolated clones encoding three distinct types of G protein beta subunit. One form was identical to previously isolated beta 1-subunit cDNA clones that encode the 36-kDa form of the beta subunit, whereas a second form was identical to previously described beta 2 cDNAs that encode the 35-kDa beta isoform. In addition, we identified another species, designated beta 3 subunit, which encodes a third distinct form of the beta subunit. The beta 3-subunit cDNA corresponds to a 2.0-kilobase mRNA expressed in all tissues and clonal cell lines examined. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the encoded peptide consists of 340-amino acid residues with a Mr of 37,221. The amino acid sequences of the three beta subunits are closely related: 83% identity between beta 1 and beta 3 subunits and 81% identity between beta 2 and beta 3 subunits. By contrast, the 3'-untranslated regions of the three cDNAs show no significant homology. Our data support the hypothesis that a family of beta-subunit polypeptides exists and extend understanding of beta-subunit structure.\r"

When challenged with Kb-positive splenocytes, transfectants expressing Ly-2 homodimers that lacked cytoplasmic tails responded nearly as effectively as wild-type Ly-2 transfectants. However in marked contrast to the wild-type Ly-2 transfectants, tailless Ly-2 transfectants were greatly impaired in their ability to respond to Kb-transfected L cells. Coexpression of the Ly-3 gene did not restore this impaired response. The unique functional property of the Ly-2 alpha cytoplasmic segment was further supported by the analysis of a chimeric Ly-3 subunit in which the cytoplasmic segment was replaced by the one from the Ly-2 alpha subunit. When associated with a soluble Ly-2 subunit lacking a transmembrane segment, the chimeric Ly-3 was indeed sufficient to restore the response to Kb-transfected L cells. Since the lateral mobility of the tailless Ly-2 molecules on the cell surface was nearly identical to that of the wild-type Ly-2 molecules, their partially impaired function may indicate that they have lost their cis-acting signaling properties but retained their ability to bind class I products of the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

The putative BAT2 and BAT3 proteins are 228 and 110 kDa, respectively, and do not appear to be members of any known family of proteins. However, BAT3 contains an amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. Both BAT2 and BAT3 are very rich in proline and include short tracts of polyproline, polyglycine, and charged amino acids. In addition, these proteins contain several unrelated families of similar repeated segments. BAT2 and BAT3 are similar to other proteins with large proline-rich domains, such as some nuclear proteins, collagens, elastin, and synapsin. BAT2 also contains four Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs typical of the integrin receptor family.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the rate of DNA synthesis in human skin could be increased by UVB radiation and to determine the potential for reversing the stimulatory effects of UVB radiation by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Split-thickness facial skin was grafted onto athymic CD-1 Nu/Nu mice on the anterolateral dorsal surface. Following graft healing for 6 weeks, grafts were treated with 0%, 2%, or 5% DFMO (a potent inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis) and subsequently irradiated with 0.15 J/cm2 of UVB light. Two days after UVB exposure, [3H]thymidine was injected and the grafts were dissected and counted. Ultraviolet radiation significantly increased thymidine incorporation, indicating increased DNA synthesis. The stimulatory effects of UV radiation were significantly reduced by topical application of 5% DFMO. Thus administration of DFMO most likely decreased the polyamine level and decreased the rate of DNA synthesis, which may have caused a decreased rate of epidermal proliferation. Thus the topical application of DFMO may prove beneficial for UVB exposure and other hyperproliferative states where a decrease in the rate of cell turnover might be desirable.\r"

An experimental storage phosphor system was used to record the images and display them on laser-printed film. Images were obtained from four or more treatment fractions from 21 cases of head and neck cancer. Precision in field placement was estimated by determining the position of a selected anatomic landmark relative to the center of the field for each series of images. The average standard deviation in the field-position measurements was 3.8 mm. Several procedural problems were also detected and corrected after review of the verification images. The results indicate that the emphasis placed on monitoring and control of field-positioning error in high-energy electron treatments should be similar to the emphasis placed on this aspect of error in photon treatment.\r"

Sixteen patients were randomized to receive rt-PA and 16 to receive UK. The rt-PA dose was administered as a 10-mg bolus into the thrombus, followed by 5 mg/h for up to 24 hours. The UK dose was administered as a 60,000 IU bolus into the thrombus, followed by 240,000 IU/h for 2 hours, 120,000 IU/h for 2 hours, and 60,000 IU/h for up to 20 hours. Serial arteriograms were obtained at baseline and at 4, 8 or 16, and 24 hours. The endpoint was defined as 95% of greater clot lysis. The cumulative numbers of patients with successful thrombolysis (rt-PA vs UK) were four vs none at 4 hours, seven vs one at 8 hours, seven vs three at 16 hours, and eight vs six at 24 hours. Lysis occurred more rapidly in the rt-PA group (P = .04). Major bleeding complications occurred in five rt-PA patients and two UK patients (P = .39). At 24 hours, fibrinogen levels were significantly lower in the rt-PA group than in the UK group (P = .01). There was no apparent difference in 30-day clinical success.\r"

Ribozymes of the \"hammerhead\" motif were identified in plant RNA pathogens. These ribozymes possess unique secondary (and possibly tertiary) structures critical for their cleavage ability. The present study shows precise cleavage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences in a cell-free system by hammerhead ribozymes. In addition to the cell-free studies, human cells stably expressing a hammerhead ribozyme targeted to HIV-1 gag transcripts have been constructed. When these cells were challenged with HIV-1, a substantial reduction in the level of HIV-1 gag RNA relative to that in nonribozyme-expressing cells, was observed. The reduction in gag RNA was reflected in a reduction in antigen p24 levels. These results suggest the feasibility of developing ribozymes as therapeutic agents against human pathogens such as HIV-1.\r"

The viral agent responsible for this form of epidemic, or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (ET-NANBH), has been serially transmitted in cynomolgus macaques (cynos) and has resulted in typical elevation in liver enzymes and the detection of characteristic virus-like particles (VLPs) in both feces and bile. Infectious bile was used for the construction of recombinant complementary DNA libraries. One clone, ET1.1, was exogenous to uninfected human and cyno genomic liver DNA, as well as to genomic DNA from infected cyno liver. ET1.1 did however, hybridize to an approximately 7.6-kilobase RNA species present only in infected cyno liver. The translated nucleic acid sequence of a portion of ET1.1 had a consensus amino acid motif consistent with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase; this enzyme is present in all positive strand RNA viruses. Furthermore, ET1.1 specifically identified similar sequences in complementary DNA prepared from infected human fecal samples collected from five geographically distinct ET-NANBH outbreaks. Therefore, ET1.1 represents a portion of the genome of the principal viral agent, to be named hepatitis E virus, which is responsible for epidemic outbreaks of ET-NANBH.\r"

Hypoxic vasodilation in isolated, perfused guinea pig hearts can be prevented by glibenclamide, a blocker of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels, and can be mimicked by cromakalim, which opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Opening of potassium channels in coronary smooth muscle cells and the subsequent drop in intracellular calcium is probably the major cause of hypoxic and ischemic vasodilation in the mammalian heart.\r"

It is unclear, however, whether these abnormalities were due to lung disease or to confounding factors. We studied the relationships between hormonal levels (triiodothyronine, thyroxine, T3 resin uptake, thyrotropin, prolactin, cortisol, and testosterone) and PaO2, PaCO2, pH, and alveolar-arterial gradient in 25 patients with chronic lung disease. These patients were highly homogeneous for diagnosis, age, sex, ambulatory status, lack of other illnesses, and minimal use of medications unrelated to lung disease, but did have various degrees of hypoxia and hypercarbia at the time of study. We found no relationship between hormonal levels and lung function, or evidence of major pituitary involvement on lateral roentgenograms of the skull, CT of the sella turcica, or stimulation of the pituitary. An inverse correlation did occur between serum levels of thyroxine and the daily dose of oral prednisone. We conclude that most of the endocrine dysfunction ascribed to chronic lung diseases is probably due to factors other than hypoxia or hypercarbia.\r"

In this study increased pulmonary gamma interferon production has been evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells were obtained from 40 patients with fibrosing alveolitis, 22 with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and 18 with connective tissue disease associated (CTD) fibrosing alveolitis. Increased gamma interferon production was seen in 12 (30%) patients and was similar in the two study groups. Up to 512 units/10(6) cells were released over 24 hours, showing that the amounts of gamma interferon released could be as large as those seen in other pulmonary diseases associated with active cellular immune processes, such as sarcoidosis. Spontaneous gamma interferon production was related to increased serum concentrations of IgG and IgM but not to serum IgA, antinuclear antibody, or rheumatoid factor titres. There was no relation between gamma interferon production and pulmonary uptake of gallium-67 citrate. The ratio of helper-inducer (Leu-3) to suppressor-cytotoxic (Leu-2) cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was similar in the two study groups and was similar in patients whose cells produced gamma interferon and those whose cells did not. These data suggest that gamma interferon is released in the lungs of a proportion of individuals with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and CTD-fibrosing alveolitis, suggesting a role for this cytokine in mediating these diseases.\r"

If the peripheral vein is used as a route for parenteral nutrition, the addition of fat to the admixture provides the advantage of enhancing caloric density, while contributing significantly less tonicity than dextrose. Certain pharmaceutical and microbiological issues need to be considered to ensure the intravenous administration of a safe and homogenous dispersion. Attention to established guidelines provided by the lipid manufacturers, as well as careful extrapolation of TNA stability data, will avert the dangers associated with infusion of coalesced lipid particles. This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of lipids as daily caloric sources, with particular emphasis on the role of the total nutrient admixtures as the primary vehicle for administration.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effect that a concise, objective, and potentially computer-extractable history would have on diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of chest radiographs, we designed and tested a computerized patient-history form that could be integrated realistically into the clinical environment. We performed a series of studies in which 247 posteroanterior normal (79) and abnormal (168) chest radiographs were interpreted by four board-certified radiologists, both with and without accompanying clinical histories. The radiologists recorded their confidence rating of the presence or absence of one or more of the following abnormalities: interstitial disease, nodule, and pneumothorax. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics showed that, with the exception of interpretation of one abnormality by one radiologist, there were no statistically significant differences (p less than .05) between cases interpreted with and without the history form for any of the radiologists. The results of our study suggest that knowledge of clinical history does not affect the accuracy of chest radiograph interpretations for the detection of interstitial disease, nodules, and pneumothoraces. These results may not be applicable to other clinical situations.\r"

The films imaged a Computerized Imaging Reference System phantom with additional detail test objects placed on its surface to produce four groups of objects with which to evaluate resolution and contrast. For objects that tested resolution, the Kyokka HR Mammo Fine (Fuji) screen was statistically significantly superior; for objects that tested contrast, the Konica Monarch screen was statistically significantly superior. Extended processing did not affect Dupont and Kodak OM film as much as it affected the other films. It did affect contrast for the other films tested. The mean glandular doses from gridless exposures ranged from 32 to 80 mrad (0.32-0.80 mGy) over all film/screen/processing combinations for a 4.5-cm-thick test object. Several new film/screen combinations can provide images superior to the Kodak Min R/OM combination at a reduced radiation dose. The Kyokka HR Mammo Fine (Fuji) screen was found statistically superior in radiographic resolution of mammographic test objects and the Konica Monarch screen was found to be superior in defining contrast.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic venocclusive disease is a serious complication associated with chemotherapy and radiation used in bone marrow transplantation patients. In the past, liver biopsy has been the only reliable means of diagnosing venocclusive disease. Biopsy in such patients may be dangerous or impossible because of severe coagulopathies. The purpose of our study was to evaluate duplex Doppler sonography in diagnosing hepatic venocclusive disease. We measured the blood velocity and flow in the portal vein, hepatic vein, and inferior vena cava of six patients who were histologically proved to have developed hepatic venocclusive disease after bone marrow transplantation. There were three men and three women with a mean age of 32 years (range, 21-44 years). Examination with Doppler sonography suggested the diagnosis a mean of 41 days (range, 11-62 days) after transplantation. In three patients, the diagnosis was suggested by reversed or \"to and fro\" flow in the portal vein. In the other three patients, the diagnosis was suggested by a decreased flow in the portal vein. One of these patients with decreased flow had subclinical hepatic venocclusive disease. In this patient, it was not the absolute level of flow but the decrease from a baseline established before ablative therapy that suggested the diagnosis. The amplitude of pulsatility in the hepatic veins appeared to decrease with the onset of venocclusive disease. In the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava, flow toward the heart was maintained. Our findings suggest that duplex Doppler sonography may be useful in detection of hepatic venocclusive disease. We speculate that, with wider experience, Doppler sonographic detection of decreased or reversed flow in the portal vein, in the proper clinical setting, may provide a noninvasive means of reliably diagnosing hepatic venocclusive disease in patients too ill to undergo liver biopsy.\r"

The catheters used included Foley catheters (36), Cope-type gastric catheters (86), or Carey-Alzate-Coons gastrojejunostomy catheters (36). Gastrojejunostomy tubes were placed in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or aspiration, gastric atony, or partial gastric obstruction. Ninety percent of the tubes were placed for feeding purposes. The technical success rate was 100%. Thirty-day follow-up was obtained in 89%. Thirty-day mortality was 26%, reflecting the substantial number of debilitated patients. No deaths were directly related to tube placement. Major morbidity was 6% and included hemorrhage, peritonitis, tube migration, and sepsis. Minor morbidity was 12%. There was no difference in 30-day mortality or feeding tolerance between the tube types (p less than .05). Patients with Foley catheters had more complications necessitating surgical intervention and an increased incidence of tube changes required within 30 days. These were the only statistically significant differences between the tubes (p less than .05). Our results show that percutaneous gastrostomy is a safe and effective means of gastroenteric feeding or decompression. Because of the fewer complications and ease of insertion, the Cope type of gastrostomy tube has become our preferred catheter for percutaneous feeding or decompression.\r"

Transvaginal catheter dilatation successfully recanalized the proximal portion of the tubes in 79 (82%) of 96 patients with obstructed tubes. In 18 of 25 with successful transvaginal catheter dilatation and 6-month follow-up salpingography, the tubes remained patent. Coexisting disease of the distal (ovarian-end) tubes was diagnosed in 29 (18%) of the patients. Pregnancy was achieved in 11 of the 157 patients (six in whom obstructions were corrected by transvaginal catheter dilatation and five in whom selective salpingograms showed patent tubes). There were no complications due to the procedure. The excellent diagnostic and therapeutic yield, lack of complications, and low cost justify the use of these percutaneous techniques to investigate female infertility and to treat obstruction of the uterine end of the fallopian tube.\r"

The appearance of the lumbar vertebral bone marrow was studied on 55 serial spin-echo and short-T1 inversion-recovery (STIR) MR images obtained in 14 patients receiving radiation therapy for Hodgkin disease, seminoma, or prostate carcinoma. Images were obtained before, at weekly intervals during, and at various monthly intervals up to 14 months after a 3- to 6-week course of fractionated paravertebral lymph-node irradiation of 1500-5000 rad (15-50 Gy). During the first 2 weeks of therapy, there was no definite change in the appearance of the marrow on spin-echo images; however, there was an increase in signal intensity on the STIR images, apparently reflecting early marrow edema and necrosis. Between weeks 3 and 6, the marrow showed an increasingly heterogenous signal and prominence of the signal from central marrow fat, shown best on T1-weighted images. Late marrow patterns (6 weeks to 14 months after therapy) varied and consisted of either homogenous fatty replacement or a band pattern of peripheral intermediate signal intensity, possibly representing hematopoietic marrow surrounding the central marrow fat. No focal marrow lesions or soft-tissue edema were identified during the course of radiation therapy; their presence should raise the possibility of the presence of a pathologic process other than radiation change. These data suggest that MR can detect radiation-induced marrow changes as early as 2 weeks after starting therapy, and that there are at least two distinct types of late marrow MR patterns.\r"

  ".W": "Cervical spondylolysis is defined as a corticated cleft between the superior and inferior articular facets of the articular pilar, the cervical equivalent of the pars interarticularis in the lumbar spine. Associated dysplastic changes and spina bifida suggest that the lesion is congenital. It is a rare condition; only 70 cases have been previously reported in the world literature. Recognition of this disorder and differentiation from traumatic articular pilar fracture or dislocation is of paramount importance in patients who have had cervical spine trauma. The present study details radiologic features in 12 patients 20-80 years old with cervical spondylolysis. Plain film radiologic findings were correlated with hypocycloidal high-resolution tomography (nine patients), CT (six patients), and MR imaging (one patient). Seven patients had spondylolysis at C6 (three bilateral) and five had the abnormality at C4 (all unilateral). Nine of 12 patients were initially misdiagnosed. Characteristic radiologic features include (1) a well-marginated cleft between the facets, (2) a triangular configuration of the pilar fragments on either side of the spondylolytic defect, (3) posterior displacement of the dorsal triangular pillar fragment, (4) hypoplasia of the ipsilateral pedicle, (5) spina bifida at the involved level, and (6) compensatory hyper- or hypoplasia of the ipsilateral articular pillars at the level above and/or below the defect. A multistudy approach was often necessary to demonstrate these findings. Heightened awareness of the radiologic features of cervical spondylolysis should allow one to differentiate it from articular pillar fracture or dislocation.\r"

Most are due to an acquired nontraumatic or congenital cause. Acute blunt abdominal trauma is a rare cause of lumbar hernia; to our knowledge, the CT diagnosis of this variety has not been reported. Since 1985, approximately 850 patients have undergone emergent abdominal CT for evaluation of acute abdominal trauma at our hospital; in seven of these patients, a traumatic lumbar hernia was diagnosed prospectively. In three patients, CT showed a flank hematoma with herniation of bowel through the lumbar triangle. CT showed pelvic fractures in three other patients, accompanied by herniation of bowel in one patient, herniation of extraperitoneal fat in another, and herniation of extraperitoneal fat and blood in the third. One patient had both a flank hematoma and a pelvic fracture with herniation of bowel. Acute traumatic lumbar hernia is a rare but significant abnormality that should be considered in patients with blunt abdominal trauma, especially in those with large flank hematomas and pelvic fractures. The hernia contents, associated injuries, and disrupted muscle layers are all well demonstrated on CT.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the value of MR imaging in monitoring the response of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma to chemotherapy. Relative signal-intensity changes on MR images in the course of chemotherapy were compared with changes in tumor volume and histopathologic findings. MR scans (T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images) were obtained in 20 patients with bone sarcoma. The first MR scan was obtained before the administration of chemotherapy in all patients. The follow-up scan was obtained in the course of treatment, before surgery. Tumor-volume and signal-intensity measurements of the intra- and extraosseous components of the tumor were analyzed. In 17 patients, histopathologic findings of the resected tumor were available for comparison with the MR images. In 12 of 17 patients there was complete agreement between changes in tumor volume, changes in the signal intensity of the extraosseous tumor component on T2-weighted images, and histopathology. In another four cases, changes in signal intensity correlated either with histopathology or with changes in tumor volume. In one patient with a pathologic fracture, no such correlation existed. A significant correlation was found between changes in signal intensities and pathologic response (r = .57, p = .02), as well as between changes in tumor volume and pathologic response (r = .53, p = .03). No correlation could be found between changes in signal intensity of the intraosseous tumor component and changes in tumor volume or histopathology. We conclude that the signal intensity of the extraosseous component of bone sarcomas on T2-weighted MR images in addition to changes in tumor volume may be useful in evaluating response to chemotherapy.\r"

We compared conventional and digital radiographs in the evaluation of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Fifty abdominal radiographs in neonates with suspected or autopsy-confirmed NEC and 50 similar radiographs of neonates without suspicion of NEC were digitized. Definition of intraabdominal anatomy was optimized by window width and level adjustment. Hard-copy radiographs of the digitally manipulated images were then produced by a laser printer. Twelve general radiologists each evaluated, without benefit of clinical information, a random mixture of 50 cases of NEC and normal controls, with both conventional and digital images for each case, for a total of 100 radiographs reviewed. Each image was evaluated for overall suspicion of NEC and the presence and severity of six radiographic signs of NEC. The radiologists also rated their confidence in their assessments. The results were compared with those from a similar analysis by an experienced pediatric radiologist to ensure validity of image evaluation. No statistically significant differences were found between the conventional and digital imaging formats for the assessment of the signs of NEC (p = .15) or for determination of the overall suspicion of NEC (p = .07). Our results show the digitized and the conventional, nondigitized radiographs to be at least equally useful for evaluating the radiographic signs of NEC and suggesting an appropriate diagnosis.\r"

Some authors have stated that high resistive indexes (RIs) occur in the presence of acute renal transplant rejection. RIs less than 0.7 are considered as probably excluding acute transplant rejection. We performed a prospective study of duplex sonographic examinations of pediatric patients (mean age, 8 years; 13 boys, two girls) with renal allografts and clinically suspected transplant disease. The results of 22 duplex studies were correlated with histopathologic data obtained between July 1987 and June 1988. RIs of the arcuate arteries in patients with acute rejection (n = 14) averaged 0.62 (range, 0.50-0.80). The RI in patients with chronic rejection (n = 1) was 0.59. RIs in patients with acute tubular necrosis (n = 3) averaged 0.66 (range, 0.59-0.72). RIs in patients with cyclosporine A toxicity (n = 4) averaged 0.66 (range, 0.58-0.79). Tubulointerstitial rejection was predominant, with only two patients showing minimal acute vascular rejection. Thirteen of 14 pediatric patients with histologically proved renal transplant rejection had a resistive index of less than 0.70. This study refutes the concept that resistive indexes of less than 0.7 exclude acute rejection.\r"

Twenty-nine patients with 67 angiographic examinations were reviewed; findings in seven patients were compared with those at autopsy. Twenty-seven (93%) of 29 patients had caliber abnormalities of the involved coronary arteries, including obstructive lesions in 20 (69%) of 29 and segmental dilatation in 16 (55%) of 29. Nine patients had interruption of the anterior descending artery and one had absent connection between the coronary arteries and the aorta. A single coronary artery was found in four of 29 patients. There was excellent correlation between clinical angiography and autopsy findings in seven patients. This study confirms the ability of high-quality clinical angiography to show significant abnormalities of the coronary arteries in infants and children with pulmonary atresia and ventriculocoronary communications.\r"

This evaluation should begin with plain films to assess cardiac and gastric positions and pulmonary vascularity. Assessment of the bronchial branching patterns should be attempted in all cases. Sonography will delineate the presence or absence of splenic tissue and the anatomy and relationships of the cava and the portal vein. When no spleen is found and the pulmonary vascularity appears congested, a subdiaphragmatic total anomalous pulmonary venous connection should be suspected and verified. If there are splenuli in the retrogastric area, particular attention should be paid to the status of the gallbladder, especially in children who do not have congenital heart disease. Selective spleen scans can confirm the presence of splenic tissue. The high cost and sedation requirement of MR would suggest that it be reserved for cases in which sonography is unable to answer the pertinent questions.\r"

  ".W": "Plain and Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images of the brain were obtained in 18 consecutive patients with meningitis (eight with tuberculous, five with bacterial, three with viral, and two with fungal infections); the MR images were compared with CT scans. MR images were obtained on a 2.0-T superconducting unit with both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences before injection and with a T1-weighted sequence after injection of Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg) in all patients. In tuberculous meningitis, MR imaging depicted ischemia/infarct, hemorrhagic infarct of basal ganglia, meningeal enhancement at either basal cistern or convexity surface of brain, and associated small granulomas in a few more patients than CT did. In bacterial meningitis, primary foci of extracranial inflammation (i.e., mastoid, paranasal sinuses) and adjacent intracranial lesions including localized dural inflammation, subdural fluid collection, and/or brain parenchymal lesions were demonstrated much better on MR than on CT. Otherwise, MR images generally matched the CT scan. Although the plain MR images, both T1- and T2-weighted, were the most sensitive in delineating ischemia/infarct, hemorrhage, and edema, they were not as specific as Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images and postcontrast CT scans in defining the active inflammatory process of the meninges and focal lesions precisely. We conclude that if Gd-DTPA is used, MR imaging appears to be superior to CT in the evaluation of patients with suspected meningitis. Precontrast MR is needed to delineate ischemia/infarct, edema, and subacute hemorrhage.\r"

Disk material demonstrates medium echogenicity, different in its sonographic features from bone, epidural fat, scar tissue, and epidural veins. A sonographic diagnosis of disk herniation was made in 43 cases, 41 of which were confirmed during surgery. Sonography established the presence or absence of disk herniation (confirmed by surgery) in 14 of 19 patients who had equivocal preoperative findings. After routine diskectomy, residual disk material was found in 17 (41%) of 41 patients, which led to further surgery in 16 patients with removal of the additional disk fragments. In 84 patients undergoing decompressive surgery for canal stenosis, sonography detected residual canal compression in 19 (23%), which led to a widened decompression in 15 of these patients. Sonography can differentiate disk material from other normal or abnormal structures in the canal; therefore, sonographic monitoring helps to ensure adequate bony decompression and complete diskectomy. We conclude that intraoperative sonography is an important tool in the surgical management of lumbar disk disease and stenosis.\r"

The CT and MR appearances of this neoplasia were more variable than generally recognized. Although seven tumors were predominantly intraparenchymal masses with calcification and cyst formation, five were intra- or juxtaventricular. CT was preferable to noncontrast MR both at initial diagnosis and follow-up for identification of calcification, recurrent tumor at surgical sites, and leptomeningeal disease. Noncontrast MR was useful primarily for localization of peri- and intraventricular lesions. We conclude that primary CNS neuroblastoma has a more variable radiographic appearance than is generally recognized, and that an intra- or periventricular epicenter is common.\r"

  ".W": "In order to provide a detailed description of the MR appearance of intracranial ependymoma, the MR examinations of 12 patients (10 with ependymomas and two with subependymomas) were reviewed and correlated with operative and pathologic reports. Three of 10 ependymomas were intraventricular, two were intraparenchymal, and five were transependymal, extending from CSF spaces into parenchyma. Both subependymomas were intraventricular. Solid ependymomas and subependymomas were iso- to hypointense relative to normal white matter on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Foci of signal heterogeneity within solid neoplasms represented methemoglobin, hemosiderin, necrosis, calcification, and encased native vessels or tumor vascularity. Gd-DTPA-enhanced images in two patients differentiated enhancing tumor from surrounding nonenhancing edema and from surrounding normal brain parenchyma. Cystic neoplasms had sharply defined, round or oval margins and uniform signal intensity equivalent to or slightly hyperintense relative to CSF. Tumor-associated calcification was not demonstrated readily by MR. Sagittal and coronal images were valuable in assessing the amount of intraventricular tumor and route of extension. We conclude that the MR differentiation of ependymomas and subependymomas from other gliomas is provided most reliably by the location and morphology of the tumor and not by differences in signal intensity. The typical ependymoma arises within the fourth ventricle as a solid mass with heterogeneous signal intensity. A propensity for spread is seen along the CSF pathways via the foramina of Magendie and Luschka and the aqueduct of Sylvius. Supratentorial ependymomas may be periventricular in location and have cystic components. The two subependymomas in our series were solid, intraventricular tumors with relatively homogeneous signal intensities.\r"

  ".U": "90195818\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with acute hip fractures are at increased risk for the development of lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis and its major complication, pulmonary embolism. It is furthermore recognized that the risk of clinically important pulmonary embolism depends to some degree on the anatomic location of the preexisting thrombosis. Because of the increased risk of thromboembolic disease, most patients with hip fracture are treated with one of several prophylactic regimens. The potential for effective prophylaxis may depend on the time of onset of the venous thrombosis. We used compression sonography to determine the anatomic location and time of onset of deep venous thrombosis in patients with hip fractures being treated with antithrombotic prophylaxis. Ninety-six patients had compression sonography of the injured extremity perioperatively and serially until discharge. Ninety-three also were examined with contrast venography when the sonogram suggested thrombus or at discharge if all sonograms were normal. Twenty areas of thrombus were identified in 18 patients, thereby yielding a prevalence of thrombosis of 19%. All patients were asymptomatic. Above-knee clot was diagnosed in 14 (78%) of these 18 patients. Nine (64%) of the 14 patients with significant clot had the abnormality on their first perioperative investigation (in eight of nine cases, the clot was adjacent to the fracture site), before any means of prophylaxis could have been initiated. Significant thrombosis developed in six patients later in their course (in only one case was the clot related to the fracture site), and the thrombus was an extension of below-knee clot in the minority of the patients. We conclude that although currently acceptable prophylaxis may decrease the frequency of thrombosis, it does little to prevent above-knee clot, which often antedates the initiation of therapy. Furthermore, as the clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis is difficult in patients with acute hip fracture, serial compression sonograms are recommended so that patients with unsuspected clot may be treated with appropriate anticoagulation and/or caval interruption.\r"

Color Doppler flow images are used to identify points of altered flow dynamics. These points are subsequently analyzed by duplex sonography, with doubling of the peak systolic velocity at the point of suspected stenosis considered the diagnostic threshold for significant stenosis. A segment-by-segment comparison made with arteriography in 14 patients (15 grafts, 92 segments) showed this approach to be 95% sensitive (18/19) and 100% specific (73/73) for the detection and localization of focal graft stenoses that involve greater than 50% narrowing of the lumen diameter. We conclude that color-assisted duplex sonography can accurately detect the presence of saphenous vein arterial bypass graft stenoses.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-reducing therapy with cholestyramine and simvastatin in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease in The Netherlands, a model of coronary artery disease incidence was used based on multivariate logistic risk functions from the Framingham study. For men with initial cholesterol levels of 8 mmol/liter, the cost per year of life saved of cholestyramine, expressed in Dutch guilders (NLG; 1 NLG = $0.50), ranges from approximately NLG 208,000 to NLG 483,000, depending on the patient's age at initiation of therapy. For simvastatin, cost-effectiveness ranges from NLG 46,000 to NLG 98,000 per year of life saved among this group of men. Similar differences between simvastatin and cholestyramine therapy prevail among women, although the costs per year of life saved for both agents are considerably higher. These results suggest that (1) simvastatin is substantially more cost effective than is cholestyramine; (2) simvastatin therapy compares favorably with other generally accepted medical practices, especially if treatment is initiated at an early age; and (3) as its long-term safety record becomes more established, simvastatin may become accepted as a drug of first choice in the treatment of persons with elevated serum cholesterol levels.\r"

The proband had no immunologically detectable apo A-II in her plasma. DNA sequence analysis showed that the proband was homozygous for a G----A transition at position 1 of intron 3 of the apo A-II gene. A sister of the proband, who had an intermediate level of plasma apo AII, was shown to be heterozygous for this base substitution. This splice-junction alteration is most likely responsible for apo A-II deficiency, since it would be expected to completely block splicing of intron 3 from the primary transcript and therefore prevent formation of functional mRNA. This deficiency seems to have little influence either on lipid and lipoprotein profiles or on the occurrence of coronary artery disease.\r"

However, recent studies have suggested that \"organic acidemias\" (such as that produced by infusing beta-hydroxybutyric acid) may not cause hyperkalemia. To learn which, if any, routinely measured biochemical indices might correlate with the finding of hyperkalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, we analyzed the initial pre-treatment values in 131 episodes in 91 patients. Serum K+ correlated independently and significantly (p less than 0.001) with blood pH (r = -0.39), serum urea N (r = 0.38) and the anion gap (r = 0.41). The mean serum K+ among the men was 5.55 mmol/l, significantly higher than among the women, 5.09 mmol/l (p less than 0.005). Twelve of the 16 patients with serum K+ greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/l were men, as were all eight patients with serum K+ greater than or equal to 7.0 mmol/l. Those differences paralleled a significantly higher mean serum urea N concentration among the men (15.1 mmol/l) than the women (11.2 mmol/l, p less than 0.01). The greater tendency to hyperkalemia among the men in this series may have been due partly to their greater renal dysfunction during the acute illness. However, other factors that were not assessed, such as cell K+ release associated with protein catabolism, and insulin deficiency per se, may also have affected serum K+ in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that vascular prostacyclin synthesis is stimulated by the oral administration of hydralazine and may account for part of its vascular effect was tested. Eight white patients with mild essential hypertension were studied in a randomized, double-blind design to assess the effects of indomethacin on hydralazine's ability to lower blood pressure, elevate pulse, and alter the vascular prostacyclin biosynthesis as assessed by the urinary excretion of the major enzymatically produced metabolite of prostacyclin, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Administration of hydralazine at either 50 mg bid or 100 mg bid for a week, doses commonly administered in clinical settings, was not associated with a statistically significant fall in mean blood pressure, although there was a tendency towards a decrease but did result in an increase in heart rate. Administration of indomethacin had no effect on the hemodynamic parameters secondary to hydralazine. Administration of indomethacin resulted in a slight but significant weight gain compared to placebo, but the addition of hydralazine did not result in a further increase in weight. Neither dose of hydralazine resulted in an increase in the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The excretion rate was 85 +/- 16 ng/g of creatinine during placebo, 88 +/- 16 ng/g of creatinine during hydralazine, 50 mg bid, and 65 +/- 8 ng/g of creatinine during hydralazine, 100 mg bid. Administration of indomethacin, 50 mg bid, resulted in a significant decrease in 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha from 65 +/- 6 ng/g to 37 +/- 8 ng/g of creatinine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neurologic assessments found 101 of 110 term neonates (91.8%) and 17 of 32 preterm neonates (53.1%) with severe acidosis to be free of neurologic deficits at the time of hospital discharge. Follow-up developmental evaluation data were available for 7 of 9 term neonates and 8 of 15 preterm neonates with abnormal examinations. Although 5 term and 6 preterm infants demonstrated mild developmental delays or mild tone abnormalities in the first year of life, none exhibited a major motor or cognitive abnormality at 12 to 24 months of age. Consequently, acidosis in umbilical cord blood, even when severe, is a poor predictor of subsequent neurologic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of pregnancy on the circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor, the 28 amino acid carboxy (C)-terminal end of the 126 amino acid atrial natriuretic factor prohormone, and the amino (N)-terminus of the prohormone was studied with three specific radioimmunoassays recognizing: (1) atrial natriuretic factor (i.e., amino acids 99 through 126), (2) the 98 amino acid N-terminus, and (3) amino acids 31 through 67 from the midportion of the N-terminus of the prohormone. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor in normal pregnant women gradually increased as pregnancy progressed, with the mean +/- SEM being 58 +/- 4 pg/ml in the first trimester, 74 +/- 5 pg/ml in the second trimester, and 89 +/- 7 pg/ml in the third trimester. Likewise, proatrial natriuretic factor 31 through 67 increased from 1421 +/- 76 pg/ml (first trimester) to 1509 +/- 84 pg/ml (second trimester) to 1758 +/- 83 pg/ml in the third trimester, whereas the whole N-terminus of the prohormone increased from 1804 +/- 98 pg/ml (first trimester) to 1909 +/- 111 pg/ml (second trimester) to 2160 +/- 79 pg/ml in the third trimester. These results suggest that release of the N-terminus of the prohormone, as well as atrial natriuretic factor, increases with the rise in blood volume associated with a normal pregnancy. The circulating concentrations of both the C-terminus and N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone increased further in the 48 hours after delivery. Because both the C-terminus and N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone contain diuresis-producing peptides, these results suggest that postpartum diuresis may be mediated by these peptides.\r"

We evaluated human myoblasts and myotubes for surface expression of HLA class I and II histocompatibility antigens. The myoblast preparations, cultured from muscle biopsy specimens, were more than 95% pure as assessed by immunostaining with the Leu19 monoclonal antibody that reacts with human myoblasts and regenerating muscle fibers. Myoblasts and myotubes constitutively expressed HLA-class I but not HLA-class II molecules. However, HLA-class II expression was induced on mononucleated myoblasts after culture for 5 days in the presence of recombinant human interferon-gamma. The results indicate that transplanted myoblasts can be rejected because of histoincompatibility at the HLA-class I and HLA class II locus. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of HLA-class II antigen on myoblasts in vivo may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune muscle disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Myoepithelial cell tumors of the mammary gland have been observed in several mammalian species and are composed of a single cell type (myoepithelium) or, more often, present as a biphasic process including neoplastic ductal epithelial cells. In dogs, these are common tumors, but in humans they are rare neoplasms of the breast, and little is yet known of their pathogenesis, particularly with respect to myoepithelial origin. The present report describes bicellular mammary gland tumors arising from the duct epithelium that were induced in (C57BL/6NCr X DBA/2NCr)F1 (B6D2F1) mice by four weekly oral applications of 1 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) starting at 8 weeks of age. Mammary tumors developed 7 to 8 months later in 14 of 57 mice, and most showed great morphologic resemblance to human adenomyoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas. Ultrastructurally, the induced tumors were composed of cuboidal epithelium with a microvillous border originating from the lining duct epithelium and plump oval or highly elongated cells that were identified as myoepithelial in origin. These spindle cells contained abundant microfilaments in parallel orientation, some with focal densities and intermediate filaments that frequently formed loose bundles or compact tonofibrils. The myoepithelial cells possessed well-developed desmosomes and plasma membrane caveolae and were regularly bordered by single or reduplicated basement membranes. By immunohistochemistry, strong immunoreactivity was observed for actin in the myoepithelial tumor component only, whereas cytokeratin was variably present in both duct epithelium and myoepithelium. Neoplastic myoepithelial cells stained purple with phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) and brilliant red with Masson's trichrome. It is suggested that DMBA-induced mouse mammary gland adenomyoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas may serve as very useful animal models to study myoepithelial tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Production of type IV collagenase by tumor cells has been linked to their metastatic potential in several experimental models. A possible role for this enzyme in basement membrane type IV collagen turnover has also been suggested. Two recently developed affinity-purified, monospecific antibodies directed against the amino terminus (H1), or an internal active site domain (metal binding region [MBR]) of human type IV collagenase, were employed in the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue samples from 55 patients. Intense cytoplasmic immunostaining of myoepithelial cells was found in normal and hyperplastic tissue, and discontinuous staining was noted in intraductal carcinomas. Luminal epithelial cells were negative or weakly positive in large- or medium-sized ducts but reacted frequently in normal terminal ducts and hyperplastic lesions. Epithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas exhibited immunoreactivity in 20 of 23 cases. Invasive carcinomas were positive in 36 of 40 cases, and metastatic cells in lymph nodes stained in 10 of 12 cases. These results support a role for type IV collagenase in the basement membrane remodeling of normal breast. Our findings suggest that myoepithelial cells play a pivotal role in this enzymatic activity. The high percentage of positive cells in invasive carcinomas and the strong immunoreactivity of lymph node metastases support the role of the enzyme in tumor invasion and metastasis and suggest that tumor cells are the essential source of the enzyme in these processes.\r"

A panel of expert physicians developed criteria for evaluating ambulatory care, and medical record abstractions using these criteria were performed on 1,590 outpatient records: 777 FFS and 813 HMO (441 staff/group, 372 IPA). While individual items of medical histories and physical examinations were performed most often for staff/group HMO patients and least often in FFS patients, odds ratios (OR) for performance in staff/group HMO patients were particularly large for health maintenance items: tonometry (OR = 8.4), mammography (OR = 2.7), pelvic examination (OR = 5.3), rectal examination (OR = 2.9), fecal occult blood test (OR = 3.3). The results suggest that recommended elements of routine and preventive care are more likely to be performed for Medicare enrollees in staff/group HMOs than in FFS settings.\r"

For the non-institutionalized population, injuries, which include intentional and unintentional, were the second leading cause of direct medical costs, accounting for $16,745 million in medical care expenditures and a major contributor to work loss and disability in the US. For the working-age population (17-64 years) injuries were the leading cost category ($11,341 million) and the third most costly category for persons 65 years of age and over ($3,479 million). The preponderance of costs were attributable to hospital-based care. Direct medical costs were disproportionately greater for males, White and other persons, and for those with household incomes less than $5,000. Injury morbidity also accounts for major indirect costs. Fractures accounted for the highest direct medical costs, greatest per capita charges (based on those with charges), and largest number of restricted activity days. These national estimates document the economic importance of injuries and direct public attention to policy imperatives related to research and prevention.\r"

Cytochemical studies and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies directed at differentiation markers failed to show alterations in the distribution or maturation of monocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from these individuals produced lower levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and Staphylococcus albus stimulation as compared to the other S. mansoni infected individuals. Overall, IL-1 production by PBMC stimulated with LPS or Staphylococcus albus was higher in infected individuals compared to uninfected controls and correlated with intensity of infection (r = 0.41, P = 0.002 for LPS; r = 0.45, P = 0.006 for S. albus). IL-1 expression by monocytes from individuals with heavy S. mansoni infection exceeded that of subjects with light infection.

Among these are patients with inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal fistulas, and pancreatitis. Substantial nutritional support has little or no direct effect upon the pathogenesis of the disease, but the discontinuance of oral intake may well have a beneficial effect on the basic disease process. Thus, the provision of enteral or parenteral nutrition gives the patient an optimal opportunity to marshal host defenses in support of healing. In organ system failures, e.g., acute renal failure, liver failure, and pulmonary failure, appropriate nutritional support may assist the patient in coping with the abnormal intermediary metabolism resulting from such failure until satisfactory organ system function returns. From this review, it seems reasonably clear that the initially malnourished patient is less able to successfully withstand the adverse effects of vigorous therapy and/or severe illness than is the well-nourished individual. Hence, correction of malnutrition, either before initiating therapy or concomitant with the treatment, is very likely to be beneficial.\r"

We simultaneously measured femoral arterial pressure and radial arterial pressure to investigate whether nitrates, in conjunction with calcium channel blockers, would influence the central-to-peripheral arterial pressure gradient. Combined nitroglycerin and nicardipine infusion during cardiac surgery involving coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement resulted in a significant increase above baseline levels in the femoral-to-radial arterial pressure gradient at 60 min after cardiopulmonary bypass. In control patients there was no significant increase in the femoral-to-radial arterial pressure gradient at 60 min after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. A subsequent study in patients given nitroglycerin and nicardipine identified that the difference in the systolic arterial pressure between femoral and radial arteries was observed 15, 60, and 120 min after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. However, there was no difference in the mean arterial pressure between femoral and radial arteries throughout the same period. We conclude that combined infusion of nitroglycerin and nicardipine, a new calcium channel blocker, intensifies the magnitude and duration of the femoral-to-radial arterial pressure gradient after cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Endoscopy records and patient charts of 101 patients who underwent SSPE during a 45-month period were analyzed for demography, indication, and results. Average age was 72.9 years. Common indications were positive occult blood tests (74%), anemia (28%), altered bowel habits (15%), and iron deficiency (13%). Most frequent findings at colonoscopy included diverticulosis (47%), polyps (37%), hemorrhoids (28%), and arteriovenous (AV) malformations (13%). Nine cases of cancer were found, seven of which were right-sided. Colonoscopy was normal in 12 per cent. EGD findings include esophagitis (55%), hiatal hernia (47%), and gastritis (33%). Eleven per cent were normal. Occult blood loss is not predictive of either a positive or negative study. SSPE is a safe and specific approach; however, based on this study, colonoscopy is recommended as the initial study for occult blood loss with plans to proceed to EGD when the lower endoscopy is normal. Even when the colonoscopy suggests the etiology for occult blood loss, EGD will yield a significant number of treatable and unsuspected lesions.\r"

PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 24 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Nineteen patients completed the study. Four patients died and one left the study because of adverse effects (pulmonary edema). INTERVENTIONS: Continuous intravenous prostacyclin administered by portable infusion pump at doses determined by acute responses during baseline catheterization in ten patients. Nine patients were treated with anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and diuretics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Starting with a baseline value for total pulmonary resistance of 21.6 units, there was a decrease of 7.9 units (95% CI, -13.1 to -2.2; P = 0.022) in the prostacyclin-treated group after 8 weeks; there was virtually no change in the conventional therapy group (from 20.6 to 20.4 units, not significant). Six of ten prostacyclin-treated patients who completed the 8-week study period had reductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 10 mm Hg, whereas only one of nine in the conventional treatment group had a similar response (P = 0.057). Nine patients receiving prostacyclin for up to 18 months have persistent hemodynamic effects, although dose requirements have increased with time. Complications have been attributable to the drug delivery system. CONCLUSIONS: Prostacyclin produces substantial and sustained hemodynamic and symptomatic responses in severe primary pulmonary hypertension and may be useful in the management of some patients with this disease.\r"

PATIENTS: Fourteen patients who had metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate less than 17 mmol/L and base excess less than -10) and increased arterial lactate (mean, 7.8 mmol/L). All had pulmonary artery catheters and 13 were receiving catecholamines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sodium bicarbonate (2 mmol/kg body weight over 15 minutes) increased arterial pH (7.22 to 7.36, P less than 0.001), serum bicarbonate (12 to 18 mmol/L, P less than 0.001), and partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2) (35 to 40 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) and decreased plasma ionized calcium (0.95 to 0.87 mmol/L, P less than 0.001). Sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride both transiently increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (15 to 17 mm Hg, and 14 to 17 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) and cardiac output (18% and 16%, P less than 0.01). The mean arterial pressure was unchanged. Hemodynamic responses to sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride were the same. These data have more than 90% power of detecting a 0.5 L/min (7%) change in mean cardiac output after administration of sodium bicarbonate compared with that after sodium chloride. Even the 7 most acidemic patients (mean pH, 7.13; range, 6.90 to 7.20) had no significant hemodynamic changes after either infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Correction of acidemia using sodium bicarbonate does not improve hemodynamics in critically ill patients who have metabolic acidosis and increased blood lactate or the cardiovascular response to infused catecholamines in these patients. Sodium bicarbonate decreases plasma ionized calcium and increases PaCO2.\r"

Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy is more potent for coronary arterial thrombolysis, producing both more rapid and more frequent (65% to 70%) reperfusion. Side effects (mainly reocclusion and bleeding) of streptokinase and rt-PA therapy are not markedly different. Whether the higher efficacy of rt-PA therapy will translate into a comparably larger reduction of morbidity and mortality remains to be determined in large comparative clinical trials. Both agents are available for clinical use. At present, the choice of agent for treating acute myocardial infarction must be based on consideration of the lower cost of streptokinase therapy compared with the established higher efficacy of rt-PA therapy for coronary recanalization.\r"

In contrast, the concentrations of the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors and their high-agonist affinity sites, which are believed to represent the functionally active receptors, were not affected by the aging process. These results may have implications for the pharmacological treatment of the age-related decline in motor function.\r"

  ".W": "To test whether early treatment could postpone the chronic colonisation of the respiratory tract with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis, we performed a pilot study in 28 patients aged 2 to 18 years. A two week course of azlocillin (150 mg/kg/day) and tobramycin (10 to 15 mg/kg/day) was given after a mean duration of P aeruginosa colonisation of five months (range one to 11 months). Weight for height increased significantly by 3.5% (SEM 0.7%) of the predicted normal after chemotherapy. The eradication of P aeruginosa that was achieved in 18 children directly after hospital treatment was only temporary. Samples from only 10 and five patients remained negative three and six months after treatment, respectively. Five children remained free from P aeruginosa for a prolonged period of 14 to 32 months. We conclude that, apart from the clinical improvement in all patients, some children might benefit from early antipseudomonas treatment with respect to the bacteriological outcome. Most children, however, experience only a temporary reduction in colonisation. Further investigations in form of controlled clinical trials seem justified.\r"

Thirty six of the 39 were preterm, and 34 were artificially ventilated (10% of all ventilated babies). Endotracheal tube colonisation had occurred in 94% of these, most commonly by Gram negative organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In only one of seven cases with simultaneous bacteraemia was the same organism grown from cultures of the blood. After controlling for gestational age and duration of artificial ventilation there was no difference in the incidence or timing of endotracheal tube colonisation between babies who did and did not have pneumonia of late onset. Ten babies with pneumonia of early onset (29%) died; all were preterm infants. Only one death (2%) was associated with an episode of pneumonia of late onset. Routine surveillance cultures were not helpful in predicting and managing pneumonia of late onset.\r"

The ratio between IgG and IgM activities was higher in individuals with a high antibody titer. The specificity of the antibody activity differed in the serums obtained from Danish and Kenyan persons (\"Danish\" and \"Kenyan\" serum, respectively). The activity in Danish serum was inhibited by an aflatoxin-like substance isolated from human urine, whereas aflatoxin B1 did not inhibit the activity. In contrast, the activity in Kenyan serum was not inhibited by the aflatoxin-like substances. Therefore, the presence of antibodies against aflatoxin in humans indicates exposure to aflatoxin or aflatoxin-antigenic material. However, the biological consequences of these antibodies remain unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular RNA particle SS-A (Ro) is a target of autoimmune response in many patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent immunologic, biochemical, and DNA cloning studies have shown that the SS-A particle consists of at least 2 polypeptide components, of 52 kd and 60 kd. Immunodiffusion analysis of 60 sera from patients with primary SS revealed 47 (78%) to be SS-A precipitin positive. Western blotting studies of the sera showed 3 groups of reactivities: 22 (47%) possessed autoantibodies against both the 60-kd and the 52-kd polypeptides, 19 (40%) reacted only with the 52-kd protein, and 6 (13%) were nonreactive in Western blots although positive in immunodiffusion. Fifty-one of 90 SLE sera (57%) were SS-A precipitin positive by immunodiffusion. In Western blots, 24 (47%) possessed antibodies against both the 60-kd and the 52-kd antigens, while 9 (18%) reacted only with the 60-kd protein. Eighteen (35%) were nonreactive by Western blot, although positive by immunodiffusion. Antibody to the 52-kd antigen without concomitant antibody to the 60-kd antigen was seen only in patients with primary SS, whereas antibody to the 60-kd antigen without concomitant antibody to the 52-kd antigen was seen only in SLE patients. Although antibodies to SS-A are detected in both SS and SLE, our findings show that there is dissociation of immune responses to the 2 component antigens of the particle, which may be evidence of different events initiating the autoimmune process in these diseases.\r"

  ".U": "90197684\r", 
  ".W": "Articular cartilage from arthritic joints of rats immunized with type II collagen is severely depleted of proteoglycans. Depletion begins within 48 hours after the onset of inflammation, prior to extensive pannus formation, and may represent a critical first step in cartilage destruction. We have immunolocalized stromelysin, an enzyme that is believed to play a major role in the pathologic degradation of proteoglycans, in the joints of rats with collagen-induced arthritis. Immunoperoxidase staining of frozen tissue sections demonstrated the presence of stromelysin in both the synovium and chondrocytes. In contrast, collagenase was localized primarily to the pannus-cartilage junction. Neither enzyme was detectable in joints from normal animals. To test the hypothesis that chondrocytes respond directly to inflammatory mediators by increasing the production of stromelysin, isolated chrondrocytes were incubated with various concentrations of interleukin-1. The culture media were also assayed for the presence of stromelysin by immunoreactivity on Western blots and by analysis of enzymatic activity on casein substrate gels. A 3-fold increase in a doublet of proteins synthesized in response to 10 units/ml of interleukin-1 was observed. These proteins also immunoreacted with the stromelysin antibody and degraded casein. Northern blotting results established that the increased levels of stromelysin were accompanied by increases in stromelysin-specific messenger RNA levels. These results suggest that stromelysin is responsible for proteoglycan degradation in early inflammatory arthritis, and that chondrocytes may play a direct role in the earliest stages of the degradation of their own matrices.\r"

Attempts to produce neuropathic joint disease experimentally with a variety of deafferentation procedures have generally been unsuccessful. However, if the knee is rendered unstable by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), breakdown of the joint occurs rapidly in dogs that have previously undergone dorsal root ganglionectomy (DRG) for deafferentation of the ipsilateral limb. In contrast, ACLT in neurologically intact dogs produces not only nonprogressive changes that are characteristic of mild osteoarthritis. This report describes 3 patients with longstanding insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom neuropathic arthropathy developed within weeks after minor trauma to the foot or ankle. In these patients, diabetic neuropathy served as the functional equivalent of dorsal root ganglionectomy, and the minor trauma served as the functional equivalent of ACLT. Together, they illustrate the phenomenon of neurogenic acceleration of joint degeneration in humans.\r"

However, it is not known if the same occurs in freshly isolated mononuclear cells, nor is it known if the virus can itself regulate cellular cytokine production. In this paper we report that HIV-1 induces peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4+ T lymphocytes to secrete TNF alpha, TNF beta and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), three cytokines having multifunctional activities and complex physiological roles. We also show that separate addition of exogenous recombinant (r) TNF alpha or rTNF beta or rIFN gamma increases HIV-1-induced syncytium formation in both PBMC and CD4+ cells by up to 10,000-fold, with TNF alpha being most potent in this regard. Finally, we show that syncytium formation induced by diverse HIV-1 isolates and LAV-2 is inhibited without the addition of exogenous r-cytokines by the respective anti-cytokine antibodies. Our study therefore demonstrates that efficient HIV replication in primary mononuclear cells is associated with the ability of the virus to induce TNF and IFN gamma secretion.\r"

After infection of the PBMC with HIV, the culture fluid was checked for infectivity (TCID50) and the level of p24 antigen. Significant diversity was observed in these values in different individuals. No correlation between the percentage of CD4-positive lymphocytes or the growth ability of PBMC and TCID50 was shown. Whether PBMC was infected with JH/3 or JMH/1 also made no difference. In some cases, however, the culture fluid possessed high (or low) p24 levels despite a low (or high) infectious virus yield. The E-rosette-positive cell fraction was separated from the PBMC preparations which showed the highest and the lowest virus yield, and the yield was determined after infection with JMH/1. The difference in virus yield and the TCID50/p24 ratio between these donors was also observed in these T-cell-enriched cell cultures. The results suggest that variations in the growth capacity of HIV in different PBMC preparations are due to the T-cell population and that the source of the PBMC influences not only the binding of the virions onto the cell surface but also the replication of the virus in the cell.\r"

Six weeks after the booster vaccination, PBMC of the five recently seroconverted individuals were assayed for in vitro mitogen or recall antigen-induced antibody synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation. The results of this study indicate that certain of the in vitro abnormalities of immune reactions, observed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals, can already be found within 3 months after seroconversion.\r"

In most patients an increase of mean right atrial pressure up to 10-14 mm Hg was followed by an increase in right ventricular stroke work index. But raising the mean right atrial pressure above 14 mm Hg was almost always accompanied by a reduction in right ventricular stroke work index. When the mean right atrial pressure was reduced by intravenous glyceryl trinitrate to less than 14 mm Hg the right ventricular stroke index increased. The same response was seen with cardiac and stroke index. The mean (SD) values of optimal right atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures were 11.7 (2.1) and 16.5 (2.7) mm Hg respectively. Thus cardiac and stroke index increased and the right ventricle reached its maximum stroke work index when the filling pressure was 10-14 mm Hg.

Mice were given i.p. injections of DMTU 0.5-4.0 mg g-1 or saline and, 1 h after injection, were exposed to 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen for periods of 0.5-8 h. At given times after nitrous oxide exposure, higher methionine synthase activities were found in the livers, kidneys and brains of mice injected with DMTU than in the saline-injected animals. These higher methionine synthase activities in the DMTU-treated animals represented a delay in the enzyme inactivation produced by nitrous oxide, as the difference in activities between the DMTU-injected and saline-injected mice decreased with increasing duration of exposure to nitrous oxide. Greater differences in methionine synthase activities between the DMTU- and saline-injected animals were observed with increasing doses of DMTU. The rate of enzyme inactivation following exposure to nitrous oxide was greater in liver and least in brain, and the difference in activities between the two groups varied with the organ examined. DMTU exhibited its greatest effect in the kidney, where methionine synthase activities were nearly doubled in the DMTU 2.0 mg g-1-injected compared with the saline-injected mice after 1-h exposure to 66% nitrous oxide. Following a marked inactivation of methionine synthase by exposing mice to 66% nitrous oxide for 4 h, injection of DMTU 2.0 mg g-1 at the end of exposure to nitrous oxide did not enhance, but impaired, the recovery of enzyme activity. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrous oxide combines with the vitamin B12 molecule of methionine synthase to form a hydroxyl radical that reacts with an inactivates the enzyme, and that DMTU slows this inactivation by scavenging hydroxyl radicals.\r"

For the Magill system, fitted with a hooded scavenging valve, the best site was deep inside the hooded valve. In contrast, the best sampling site in an ER system (e.g. Bain system) was in the tracheal tube. For AR systems, the loss of a fresh gas elimination pattern (carbon dioxide trace failing to reach zero) was shown to occur at the onset of rebreathing. As the sampling site was moved distally into the exhaust limb, the same pattern was seen at greater flow rates--that is, before rebreathing was actually occurring. When sampling was within the tracheal tube, using ER systems, a typical \"rebreathing wave\" occurred at the onset of established rebreathing.\r"

Human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha and lipopolysaccharide induced a concentration- and time-dependent release of prostaglandin E2, but not prostacyclin, from cultured neonatal and adult human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Prostaglandin E2 was measurable at 2 h after stimulation with 1 U/ml interleukin 1 alpha, levels increased rapidly up to 6 h and more slowly up to 24 h. Lipopolysaccharide (20 micrograms/ml) induced measurable release of prostaglandin E2 between 2 and 4 h after stimulation and release continued up to 24 h when incubation was terminated.

The sensitivity and magnitude of responses of the cutaneous endothelial cells to these pro-inflammatory stimuli appeared to be dependent on their derivation.\r"

Repeated instillations can induce cystitis and an eczematous eruption affecting the palms, soles and face. If these effects are due to delayed hypersensitivity with sensitization to mitomycin C occurring in the bladder wall, it should be possible to demonstrate antigen-presenting cells in the bladder wall and positive patch tests to the drug. Using an immuno-alkaline phosphatase method we have identified CDI+ cells in bladder epithelium and submucosa and have demonstrated Birbeck granules in a few cells. In further support of our hypothesis it was also possible to demonstrate delayed type hypersensitivity in 13 out of 26 patients who had received mitomycin instillations by applying the allergen as a patch test. These results indicate that the eczematous eruption in this group of patients is most likely a hypersensitivity reaction and that it may be mediated transvesically.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary methemoglobinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) deficiency. In an attempt to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the enzyme deficiency, we isolated the b5R gene from a patient homozygous for hereditary methemoglobinemia, generalized type, and compared its nucleotide sequence with that of the normal NADH-cytochrome b5R gene. Only one difference was observed; a thymidine at the first position of codon 127 (TCT) was altered to a cytidine in the b5R gene of the patient, resulting in replacement of serine with proline. Dot blot hybridization of the amplified DNA samples with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the proband and her brothers were homozygous for this mutation and that their father was heterozygous. Although the activity of b5R in lymphoblastoid cells from homozygotes was reduced to 10% of the normal level, RNA blot and protein blot analyses of the lymphoblastoid cells showed that synthesis of b5R messenger RNA and the b5R polypeptide were normal. Serine at residue 127 is presumed to be in an alpha-helix structure that is part of a nucleotide-binding domain. These observations suggest that replacement of Pro-127 causes a significant conformation change in the nucleotide-binding domain that affects electron transport from NADH to cytochrome b5. Functional enzyme deficiency results in a generalized type of hereditary methemoglobinemia.\r"

L-722,151 (0.1 mg/kg/min intravenously [IV] or placebo was administered 15 minutes before current initiation (150 microA) and for the duration of the experiment (270 minutes). Fifteen minutes after thrombus formation, heparin (300 U/kg, IV) was administered, followed 45 minutes later by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (10 micrograms/kg/min, IV for 90 minutes). Placebo-treated animals thrombosed at 48.9 +/- 8.1 minutes (mean +/- SEM) and reperfused in response to tPA at 49.1 +/- 9.3 minutes. L-722,151 pretreated animals thrombosed at 44.4 +/- 9.7 minutes and reperfused in response to tPA at 16.4 +/- 2.8 minutes (P less than .05 v vehicle). Furthermore, residual thrombus mass was reduced by L-722,151 from 6.9 +/- 1.9 mg in placebo-treated animals to 1.7 +/- 0.6 mg (P less than .05 v vehicle). Acute reocclusion occurred in 86% of placebo and in 75% of L-722,151-treated animals. The incidence of tPA-induced reperfusion in L-722,151-treated dogs was 100% (8 of 8), whereas only 70% (7 of 10) of placebo-treated dogs reperfused. These results demonstrate that pretreatment with L-722,151 hastens reperfusion time threefold and reduces residual thrombus mass. These effects occurred with no change in systemic blood pressure in response to L-722,151. When L-722,151 was administered 15 minutes after thrombus formation in a separate group of dogs (n = 5), no beneficial effect on thrombolysis time or thrombus mass was observed. Thus, the specific factor XIIIa catalyzed crosslinking reaction(s), which may determine(s) resistance to plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation, occur(s) rapidly. Inhibition of this crosslinking by pretreatment with L-722,151 promotes tPA-induced thrombolysis.\r"

  ".W": "von Willebrand factor (vWF) is synthesized in endothelial cells (EC) and may be either secreted constitutively or stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) for regulated release. Because fibrin stimulates rapid vWF release from EC, we examined the binding of EC synthesized vWF to fibrin. Culture medium containing constitutively secreted vWF was removed from metabolically labeled primary cultures of human umbilical vein EC, and vWF released from WPB was obtained after stimulation by A23187. vWF-deficient fibrinogen with or without factor XIII was added to releasate or media and clotted with thrombin to form crosslinked or noncrosslinked fibrin. vWF was immunopurified from releasate or media before and after clotting, and the amount and multimeric pattern of vWF bound was determined after sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose gel electrophoresis. High molecular weight multimers of vWF, whether secreted constitutively or released from WPB, bound preferentially to fibrin. Multimers of greater than 20 subunits represented 60% +/- 4% (SEM) of A23187 released vWF and 11% +/- 5% of media vWF, but binding to fibrin was similar, 96% +/- 1% and 94% +/- 2%, respectively. A progressively smaller proportion of vWF bound as multimer size decreased, and dimeric vWF binding was least, with 34% +/- 5% binding from A23187 releasate and 51% +/- 4% from media. The amount of vWF binding to crosslinked or noncrosslinked fibrin was similar, and preferential binding of high molecular weight multimers occurred with both. As measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 45% +/- 2% of constitutively secreted vWF bound to crosslinked fibrin and 50% +/- 2% to noncrosslinked fibrin. The propolypeptide of vWF did not bind to fibrin. These findings indicate that binding of EC secreted vWF binding to fibrin depends on multimeric size but not on factor XIII crosslinking. This suggests that vWF released from EC in the presence of fibrin will bind locally, thereby facilitating platelet adhesion to the hemostatic plug or thrombus.\r"

  ".U": "90199071\r", 
  ".W": "It has been reported that omental fat tissue is a good source of human microvascular endothelial cells. By characterization we demonstrate that the epitheloid cells isolated from omental tissue are not endothelial cells, but mesothelial cells. They contain abundant cytokeratins 8 and 18, which are absent in endothelial cells, and vimentin. No staining with the endothelial-specific antibodies EN-4 and PAL-E is observed. A faint and diffuse staining of von Willebrand factor (vWF) is seen in mesothelial cells, whereas microvascular endothelial cells from subcutaneous fat display vWF in distinct granular structures. Human peritoneal mesothelium produces plasminogen activator-dependent fibrinolytic activity, which is essential in the resolution of fibrous exudates and may therefore be important in preventing the formation of fibrous peritoneal adhesions. This fibrinolytic activity is plasminogen activator-dependent, but has not been fully characterized. We report here that human omental tissue mesothelial cells in vitro produce large amounts of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), together with type 1 and 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1 and PAI-2). PAI-1 is predominantly secreted into the culture medium, whereas the major part of PAI-2 is found in the cells. No urokinase-type plasminogen activator is detected. On stimulation with the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor (TNF), at least a threefold decrease in t-PA antigen is observed, together with an increase in both PAI-1 and PAI-2. TNF also induces a marked change in cell shape. Whereas TNF and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have similar effects on the production of PA inhibitor by human endothelial cells, LPS has no or only a relatively small effect on the fibrinolytic properties of mesothelial cells. The decreased fibrinolytic activity induced by the cytokine TNF may impair the natural dissolution of fibrin deposits at the peritoneum in the presence of an inflammatory reaction.\r"

The antigen, named TCA-1 (T-cell cytoplasmic antigen), is an intracellular glycoprotein found mainly in the Golgi stacks, although a few cell lines also display surface membrane TCA-1. Many but not all T-cell neoplasms express this antigen. The antigen is absent from neoplastic and normal human tissue outside the T-lymphocyte lineage. TCA-1 was identified by murine monoclonal antibodies produced after immunization of mice with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The glycoprotein is a monomer containing approximately 4% N-linked carbohydrate with terminal D-galactose residues. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of TCA-1 shows homology with an immunoglobulin heavy chain region, which suggests that TCA-1 may belong to the immunoglobulin supergene family of receptor and adhesion molecules.\r"

  ".U": "90199082\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined properties of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetase from human erythrocytes. The enzyme was found to be cold labile and extremely unstable in crude hemolysate, with complete loss of activity occurring after 24 hours at 4 degrees C. However, maintenance of crude hemolysate at 20 to 25 degrees C in the presence of EDTA and KCl increased NAD synthetase stability substantially (half-life = 10 days). Using these conditions, NAD synthetase was purified 3,100-fold with a 29% yield using DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and dialysis. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), adenosine triphosphate, Mg2+, glutamine, and K+ were 0.108, 0.154, 1.36, 2.17, and 8.32 mmol/L, respectively. The pH optimum ranged between 6.8 and 7.4, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 483 +/- 5 Kd. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by Pb2+ and Zn2+, with concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition of activity of 1.3 and 2.0 mumol/L, respectively. The incubation of intact red blood cells with lead followed by rigorous washing to remove lead abolished nearly all NAD synthetase activity. In contrast, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which is not sensitive to lead, was unaffected, whereas pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase activity, which is sensitive to lead, was decreased 30% to 50% under these conditions. More importantly, patients with lead overburden (34 to 72 micrograms Pb2+/dL blood) all had markedly decreased NAD synthetase activity. These data together with other results suggest that erythrocyte NAD synthetase activity is a sensitive indicator of lead exposure in humans.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma near the Sellafield nuclear plant is associated with established risk factors or with factors related to the plant. DESIGN--A case-control study. SETTING--West Cumbria health district. SUBJECTS--52 Cases of leukaemia, 22 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 23 of Hodgkin's disease occurring in people born in the area and diagnosed there in 1950-85 under the age of 25 and 1001 controls matched for sex and date of birth taken from the same birth registers as the cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Antenatal abdominal x ray examinations, viral infections, habit factors, proximity to and employment characteristics of parents at Sellafield. RESULTS--Expected associations with prenatal exposure to x rays were found, but little information was available on viral illnesses. Relative risks for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were higher in children born near Sellafield and in children of fathers employed at the plant, particularly those with high radiation dose recordings before their child's conception. For example, the relative risks compared with area controls were 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.53) for being born further than 5 km from Sellafield 2.44 (1.04 to 5.71) for children of fathers employed at Sellafield at their conception, and 6.42 (1.57 to 26.3) for children of fathers receiving a total preconceptual ionising radiation dose of 100 mSv or more. Other factors, including exposure to x rays, maternal age, employment elsewhere, eating seafood, and playing on the beach did not explain these relationships. Focusing on Seascale, where the excess incidence has predominantly been reported, showed for the four out of five cases of leukaemia and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose fathers were employed at Sellafield and for whom dose information was obtained that the fathers of each case had higher radiation doses before their child's conception than all their matched control fathers; the father of the other Seascale case (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was not employed at the plant. These results seem to explain statistically the geographical association. For Hodgkin's disease neither geographical nor employment associations with Sellafield were found. CONCLUSIONS--The raised incidence of leukaemia, particularly, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among children near Sellafield was associated with paternal employment and recorded external dose of whole body penetrating radiation during work at the plant before conception. The association can explain statistically the observed geographical excess. This result suggests an effect of ionising radiation on fathers that may be leukaemogenic in their offspring, though other, less likely, explanations are possible. There are important potential implications for radiobiology and for protection of radiation workers and their children.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Antenatal abdominal x ray examinations, viral infections, habit factors, proximity to and employment characteristics of parents at Sellafield. RESULTS--Ascertainment of cases through multiple sources was as complete as possible, and the diagnosis was established for nearly all cases from hospital records and by independent pathological review when suitable material (60% (58) of cases) was available. Identification and tracing of the parents of cases and controls enabled questionnaires to be forwarded to 730 (66%), and 467 (64%) of the questionnaires were returned completed. Obstetric records were located for 481 (44%) of the relevant births, more frequently in recent years. Linkage of study subjects to the Sellafield workforce file enabled dates of employment and records on external doses of whole body ionising radiation to be obtained. Concordance of information from duplicate sources (when available) was reasonably high with no indications of bias. CONCLUSION--Overall the collected data were sufficiently reliable for detailed analysis and careful interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine how local attitudes to management of extreme preterm labour can influence data on perinatal mortality. DESIGN--One year prospective study in a geographically defined population. SETTING--The 17 perinatal units of Trent region. PATIENTS--All preterm infants of less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation in the Trent region. INTERVENTIONS--Infants who had been considered viable at birth were referred for intensive care; those who had been considered non-viable received terminal care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Whether each infant was born alive, dead, or alive but considered non-viable. RESULTS--Large differences were observed among units in the rates of delivery of infants of less than or equal to 27 weeks' gestation (rates varied from 7.2 to 0 per 1000 births). These differences were not present in the data relating to infants of between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation. The variation seemed to result from different approaches to the management of extreme preterm labour--that is, whether management took place in a labour ward or a gynaecology ward. CONCLUSIONS--Place of delivery of premature babies (less than or equal to 27 weeks' gestation) may influence classification and hence figures for perinatal mortality. In addition, the fact that the onus of judgment regarding viability and classification is often placed on relatively junior staff might also affect the figures for perinatal mortality. The introduction of a standard recording system for all infants greater than 500 g would be advantageous.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To provide information on endometrial stimulation after discontinuation of treatment with oestradiol implants. DESIGN--Long term follow up of withdrawal bleeding patterns in women taking progestogens cyclically every month after oestradiol implant treatment was ended. SETTING--Specialist menopause clinic. SUBJECTS--10 Postmenopausal patients (at least 12 months' amenorrhoea after the last spontaneous period) who were treated with oestradiol implants for typical symptoms of oestrogen deficiency. The oestradiol dose was 50 mg, reimplantation occurring roughly every six months. Patients subsequently either needed to discontinue the hormone treatment for medical reasons or expressed a desire to stop treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Duration of endometrial stimulation--defined as the presence of withdrawal bleeding in response to progestogen given cyclically--after insertion of the last oestradiol implant. RESULTS--Four patients eventually stopped bleeding, their mean duration of bleeding being 35 months (range 27-43 months). One patient required hysterectomy 26 months after the last implantation because of persistent irregular bleeding despite treatment with high doses of progestogen. Three patients bled for 22, 30, and 36 months and then restarted oestrogen treatment because symptoms returned. The last two patients subsequently continued to bleed 12 and 21 months after the last implantation. CONCLUSIONS--The duration of endometrial stimulation after implantation can be prolonged, up to 43 months. Insertion of oestradiol implants can carry a long term commitment to the cyclical administration of progestogen and regular withdrawal bleeding if endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma are to be avoided.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis of prescribing totals for several oral antibiotics obtained retrospectively from the prescription pricing bureau for the years 1983-7. SETTING--Audit of anti-infective prescribing in general practice in Northern Ireland over five years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Respective usage of agents defined as \"common\" and \"occasional\" in 1983. RESULTS--There was a gradual decrease in the relative use of common agents from 82% of the total in 1983 to 77% in 1987 together with a complementary increase in the use of occasional agents from 5% to 10%. Pronounced changes were noted in the use of amoxycillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, minocycline, doxycycline, and amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION--Though this survey found reasonably conservative prescribing, the trend towards increased use of occasional agents has both clinical and cost implications which could be addressed by the use of a prescribing formulary.\r"

Of the 80 who replied, a quarter had received no careers guidance and a quarter no feedback about their work performance. Many reported having had difficulties in their post, but few had received help from senior staff or their consultant. The perceived needs for counselling were considerable. Careers counselling was thought to be essential in the preregistration year by all of the doctors and in senior house officer posts by three quarters. Nearly all would have chosen regular appraisal and nearly half wanted counselling for particular difficulties. Doctors in the training grades clearly believed that they needed counselling, but in most cases they did not receive it.\r"

A total of 101 (79%) replied. In the case of candidates for dialysis roughly one third of respondents tested only people they considered at risk of infection with HIV and nearly one fifth considered testing unnecessary. In the case of candidates for transplantation routine HIV testing was carried out by 68 of 100 nephrologists; 22 tested only patients \"at risk\" and 10 did not test. A positive HIV test result was considered by most but not all respondents (63/86) to exclude patients from transplantation. Twenty four of 88 nephrologists considered that HIV positivity should exclude patients from haemodialysis, but only seven of 87 would exclude such patients from peritoneal dialysis. Similar attitudes pertained for patients with end stage renal failure who refused HIV testing. Testing with the patient's knowledge and consent was the policy of two thirds of nephrologists, but a patient's signature was obtained by only 24 of 88. There should be a consensus on practice for HIV testing of patients with end stage renal failure.\r"

DESIGN--Multicentre double blind, placebo controlled, random order crossover trial with individual determination of maximum tolerated dosage and four month follow up. SETTING--Outpatient departments at six university neurological centres. PATIENTS--67 Outpatients (24 men, 43 women) aged 53-81 (mean 66 (SD 7.3)) selected according to the following criteria: probable Alzheimer's disease as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association; absence of mood disorder; mini mental state score lower than 26; availability of a close relative able to complete questionnaires; and informed consent of the patient or his or her closest relative, or both. INTERVENTIONS--Mean of 114 mg tacrine or placebo daily plus 1200 mg lecithin daily given in three divided doses for one four week active treatment period and one four week control period without washout at crossover. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cognitive state as assessed by Folstein's mini mental state rating scale, behavioural state as assessed by the Stockton geriatric rating scale, and overall state as assessed with a visual analogue scale rated by both the relative and the physician. RESULTS--Compared with placebo tacrine did not improve either the mini mental state score (mean 14.9 (SD 7.3) v 14.8 (7.3)) or the Stockton geriatric score (28.2 (15.7) v 28.7 (17.8)), but a slight and statistically significant improvement occurred in the physician's score on the visual analogue scale (6.3 (10.2) v 11.6 (17.9)). Seven patients dropped out. Six patients were excluded because of acute hepatitis and one withdrew for personal reasons not related to treatment. Two other patients developed acute hepatitis at the end of the eight week crossover trial and another during the follow up study. Twenty patients complained of gastrointestinal side effects. CONCLUSIONS--Neither short term nor long term treatment with oral tacrine at dosages lower than 125 mg/day improves the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, these dosages may induce hepatitis (nine of 67 patients in this series).\r"

DESIGN--Prospective cohort study (case-base linkage) with routine national surveillance systems. Denominators (base population) were obtained from monitoring a random sample of returning British travellers with the international passenger survey. Numerators (cases) were obtained from reports of malaria infections in British residents, through the Malaria Reference Laboratory network. SETTING--International passenger survey conducted at passport control of international airports in Britain. Malaria reports received nationally were collated centrally in London. SUBJECTS--2948 British residents (0.2%) returning to Britain in 1987 randomly selected and questioned and 1052 British residents with microscopically confirmed malaria infections in 1987, whose case reports were reviewed and on whom additional data were collected by postal survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Annual incidence subdivided by categories of risk. Chemoprophylactic efficacy for east and west Africa by principal regimens and compliance. RESULTS--Annual rates of reported infection per 100,000 travellers to Oceania were 4100; to west and east Africa were 375 and 172 respectively; to Latin America, the Far East, and the Middle East were 12, 2, and 1 respectively. Immigrants visiting friends and relatives in Ghana and Nigeria were at greatest risk (1303 and 952 per 100,000 respectively) in west Africa. Business travellers to Kenya experienced the highest attack rates in east Africa (465 per 100,000). Age-sex specific attack rates varied by region. No prophylaxis was reported to have been used by 23% of British visitors to west Africa, 17% to east Africa, 46% to central or southern Africa, and 58% visiting south Asia. The efficacy of chloroquine plus proguanil against P falciparum infection was 73% and 54% in west and east Africa respectively. Lower values were obtained for chloroquine alone and proguanil alone. The efficacy of Maloprim (pyrimethamine-dapsone) was 61% in west Africa, but only 9% in east Africa. Visitors to west Africa who did not comply with their chemoprophylactic regimen were at a 2.5-fold higher risk of infection than fully compliant users. Non-compliant visitors to east Africa had similar rates of infection as non-drug users. CONCLUSIONS--In 1987 chloroquine plus proguanil was the preferred chemoprophylactic regimen for P falciparum infection in Africa; antimalarial drugs must be taken regularly to be effective.\r"

In all, 17,958 attendances were for orthopaedic injuries or injuries caused by an accident; 1966 patients were admitted to the unit. CONCLUSIONS--Most trauma is musculoskeletal and relatively minor according to the injury severity score. All but a few injuries can be managed in district general hospitals. In their recent report the Royal College of Surgeons has overestimated the requirements that a British district general hospital would have of a regional trauma centre.\r"

  ".U": "90199183\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the best means of detecting hearing disability in subjects aged 50-65 and whether rehabilitative intervention is acceptable in this age group. DESIGN--Questionnaire survey of patients on general practice age-sex registers. Two types of questionnaire were used, one being based on the closed set approach of the Institute of Hearing Research questionnaire, which had been used in a pilot study, and the other being a simplified version of this questionnaire developed by the Welsh Hearing Institute and based on open set questions. Questionnaires were sent up to three times, and any patients who had not responded two months after the last posting were personally contacted. SETTING--Two general practices in Glyncorrwg and Blaengwynfi in the Afan valley, West Glamorgan. PATIENTS--271 Patients in Glyncorrwg (136 men, 135 women) and 333 patients in Blaengwynfi (173 men, 160 women) aged 50-65. INTERVENTIONS--All patients indicating hearing disability in answering the questionnaires were invited to attend for a evaluative session in their village. After audiometric testing advice and arrangements for fitting a hearing aid were offered as appropriate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates and prevalence of hearing disability before intervention and of possession of hearing aids before and after intervention. RESULTS--After three postings and personal contact the response rate was 98% (266/271) in Glyncorrwg, where the complex questionnaire was used, and 97% (322/333) in Blaengwynfi. The prevalence of hearing disability was respectively 53% (141/266) and 46% (148/322) and the prevalence of owning a hearing aid 7% (19/266) and 8% (24/322). After intervention the possession of hearing aids rose to 24% (64/266) in Glyncorrwg and 22% (71/322) in Blaengwynfi; six months later the aids were being used regularly. A direct comparison of the two questionnaires in 69 subjects from Blaengwynfi showed no significant differences in the amount of disability detected by each one. The first posting of questionnaires detected 65% (189/289) of the hearing disability in the two villages or 78% (72/92) of those prepared to accept hearing aids for the first time; 96% (88/92) of those who accepted hearing aids were detected by two postings. CONCLUSIONS--Simple questionnaires are effective in detecting hearing disabilities in people aged 50-65, and intervention was acceptable in many of those who reported having difficulties in hearing. The response rates from successive postings suggest that two postings are sufficient in terms of the return in detecting those who will accept intervention.\r"

  ".U": "90199187\r", 
  ".W": "A sentinel health information system using telematics and a network of general practitioners was set up in Aquitaine in south western France in 1986. Among the health problems under surveillance was acute diarrhoea. Data for each patient who fulfilled the usual case definition for acute diarrhoea were reported by general practitioners using home terminals (Minitels) connected to a central computer by telephone. Over one year 2234 cases of diarrhoea were reported, the incidence varying from 0.8 to 1.5 cases per doctor per week. Seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with peaks in the winter and in the summer. Only 379 (17%) episodes of diarrhoea were classified as severe, and these patients consulted their general practitioners earlier than patients whose diarrhoea was less severe. Foreign travel was rarely found in the patients' histories, but clusters of cases were found in communities (4.6%) and in families (22.3%). The advantages of this system were easy reporting and immediate feedback, but it was difficult to extrapolate the data, and the system was inadequate for intervening in outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease. Our knowledge of diarrhoeal diseases in south west France improved.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specially designed incubation chamber, differential synthesis and the response to added arachidonic acid (25 mM) and L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (LAP; 2 mM) was quantified in gallbladders from male and female dogs. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) was the predominant prostanoid synthesized, and tissues from females produced much more PGI2 under basal conditions than did gallbladders harvested from male dogs. Addition of arachidonic acid stimulated PGI2 synthesis by almost 100 per cent. Arachidonate-stimulated mucosal and serosal production of PGI2 were (mean(s.e.m.] comparable, 343(178) and 375(89) pg/cm2/min, respectively. Gallbladders from female animals synthesized significantly more PGI2 than did tissue from males. Indomethacin inhibited PGI2 synthesis in a dose-response manner; at 7 x 10(-5) M, prostanoid synthesis was inhibited by greater than 80 per cent. Arachidonic acid did not stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by gallbladder tissue. LAP similarly stimulated PGI2 biosynthesis, but in contrast to the effect of arachidonic acid, the effect was significantly greater in the serosa than the mucosa, 355(107) and 213(59) pg/cm2/min, respectively. LAP also stimulated PGE2 biosynthesis by the canine gallbladder in a pattern very similar to that of PGI2. Based on the differences in response to the two agents added, we conclude that arachidonic acid and L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine stimulate prostaglandin biosynthesis via independent pathways. We advocate the use of the incubation chamber for the assessment of prostanoid biosynthesis by the gallbladder in vitro.\r"

Mean(s.d.) ankle/brachial index was increased by 0.53(0.26) and there was no significant difference between the group receiving t-PA alone and that receiving t-PA and heparin. No strokes or major haemorrhages occurred but there were four (13 per cent) minor haematomas associated with the catheter entry site. There were four (13 per cent) deaths from myocardial infarction occurring between 5 and 21 days after treatment. Rethrombosis occurred in four cases (13 per cent). In two patients following t-PA alone, rethrombosis occurred after 2 and 11 days. Limb salvage was achieved with a successful repeat thrombolysis and a femoropopliteal graft respectively. Rethrombosis after t-PA and heparin occurred after 30 days in two patients due to poor run-off and extensive proximal atheromatous disease respectively. t-PA is a safe, effective thrombolytic agent when given as a low-dose intra-arterial infusion. The addition of low-dose heparin does not produce any significant benefit.\r"

The intra cellular free amino acid concentrations of skeletal muscle were determined in tissue specimens obtained before operation and on the third postoperative day using a percutaneous needle biopsy technique. The mean (s.e.m.) decrease in the concentrations of free intracellular glutamine on the third postoperative day was less pronounced (P less than 0.05) in the ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate group (18.8(7.5)per cent) than in the control group (39.4(5.1)per cent) or the branched chain amino acid group (45.3(6.1)per cent). In conclusion, in the immediate postoperative period total parenteral nutrition supplemented with ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate countered the decline in the muscle free glutamine.

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. STUDY IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION: Computerized searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCISEARCH databases were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was reviewed. Two prospective clinical trials of Hib polyribosyl ribitol phosphate conjugated with diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D) were identified. In addition, one cohort study of the PRP-D vaccine, two trials of the PRP vaccine, five case-control studies of the PRP vaccine and 10 randomized controlled trials of the immunogenicity of the PRP-D vaccine were identified. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and descriptive information concerning the study populations, the interventions and the outcome measurements was extracted. RESULTS: The difference in the effectiveness of the PRP-D vaccine between the prospective trials, in which a three-dose schedule had been used beginning at 2 to 3 months of age, was clinically important (37% v. 83%) but not statistically significant. The PRP vaccine, which induces lower antibody responses than the PRP-D vaccine does, was clinically effective only in a subgroup of one prospective trial; 90% effectiveness was reported among children 18 to 60 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Hib vaccine appears to be less effective in high-risk populations. None the less, because of the large variation in baseline risk, the number of children who would have to be vaccinated to prevent one case of invasive Hib disease is substantially less for high-risk than for low-risk populations. The vaccination of children at high risk, such as native children, with the PRP-D vaccine using a four-dose schedule (at 2, 4, 6 and 14 months of age) seems warranted. The currently available evidence does not strongly support a policy of universal vaccination with either a one-dose or a four-dose schedule.\r"

Between June 1986 and September 1988, 110 patients were randomly allocated to receive either ifosfamide (3 g/m2 plus 3 g/m2 of mesna) or mitomycin 8 mg/m2, on days 1, 29, and 71 only. In both arms vindesine was given 3 mg/m2 weekly X 5 then every 2 weeks. In the MVP arm, 120 mg/m2 of cisplatin was administered on days 1 and 29 and then every 6 weeks, whereas in the IVP arm 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was given on the same time schedule. One hundred three patients were evaluable for response and toxicity and 56% of patients had Mountain's Stage IV disease. The response rate was 26% (14/53 patients) in the MVP arm (95% confidence interval, 14%-39%) and 20% (ten of 50 patients) in the IVP arm (95% confidence interval, 10%-34%). Neither the response rate nor the median survival times were significantly different, although more nephrotoxicity was produced in the MVP arm, grade 1+ in 43% versus 26% in IVP arm (P = 0.04). Results obtained from this study fail to demonstrate that mitomycin or ifosfamide have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of the vindesine/cisplatin combination.\r"

In this study, clinical hyperthermia for malignant liver tumor was evaluated for 67 tumors in which we could measure intratumor temperatures. Of the 67 tumors, 41 were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), six cholangiocarcinomas, and 20 metastatic tumors. Cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic tumors were more susceptible to this treatment than HCC. Of the three types of HCC, higher intratumor temperatures were achieved in the diffuse type than in the nodular or massive types. The minimum tumor temperature of HCC stayed below 40 degrees C in 46% of cases, especially in larger tumors. The local response rates (complete remission plus partial remission/all) were 28% and 11% for HCC and non-HCC, respectively, for thermochemotherapy; 86% and 33%, for thermoradiotherapy; and 33% and 89%, for thermotherapy with embolization. No apparent relationship was observed between the intratumor temperatures and local response rate.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant sweat gland neoplasms are rare tumors. Historically, the principal mode of treatment has been local surgical excision. Eight published studies show that greater than 50% of patients develop either local tumor recurrence after surgery or regional lymph node metastases. Most patients have evidence of locoregional failure before distant metastases are detected. Three patients were recently referred to the University of Arizona Cancer Center for consideration of irradiation after resection of such tumors. In two patients, the tumor was located on the scalp and, in one patient, on the alar surface of the nose. Their ages ranged from 19 to 60 years. All underwent surgical resection followed by high-dose irradiation of the surgical bed (approximately 70 Gy) and regional lymphatic chains (approximately 50 Gy). Two patients remain disease-free at 27 and 35 months, respectively, after completion of treatment; the third died of rapidly progressive systemic metastases. A review of the literature is provided focusing on treatment success and predominant patterns of recurrence. Finally, a rational approach for evaluation of patients that might benefit from local irradiation is presented.\r"

We evaluated the influence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (acetylsalicylic acid, n = 8) or a thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist (SQ29548, n = 6) on these C5a-induced cardiovascular responses. Open-chest anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor heart rate, arterial blood pressure, left anterior descending coronary blood flow, regional left ventricular segment shortening, and dP/dt. Oxygen content, lactate concentration, leukocyte count, and thromboxane B2, the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2, were measured in arterial and regional coronary venous blood. Repetitive injections of intracoronary C5a (500 ng) given 60 minutes apart showed no tachyphylaxis of the hemodynamic response. However, tachyphylaxis was seen in coronary blood flow changes when injections were spaced 30 minutes apart. An increase in myocardial oxygen extraction and lactate production was observed after intracoronary C5a. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid (50 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated C5a-induced decreases in coronary blood flow (-8 +/- vs. -3 +/- 1 ml/min) and regional left ventricular segmental shortening (-10 +/- 3% vs. -2 +/- 1%) and blocked the maximal increase in coronary venous thromboxane B2 (2.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.1 pmol/ml plasma). Furthermore, SQ29548 (30 micrograms/kg/min) reduced C5a-induced changes in coronary blood flow (-13 +/- 2 vs. -4 +/- 2 ml/min) and segmental shortening (-14 +/- 2% vs. -3 +/- 1%). Neither cyclooxygenase inhibition nor thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 antagonism blocked the decrease in coronary venous granulocyte count.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast (p less than 0.01), platelets from patients showed decreased ligand binding (n1 = 40 +/- 20 sites/cell; n2 = 800 +/- 210 sites/cell) with little change in the affinity of the receptors (Kd1 = 7.50 +/- 1.6 nM; Kd2 = 0.68 +/- 0.24 microM). On the other hand, the platelets from the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 7) who were hospitalized for acute chest pain but had normal coronary arteries did not show any impairment of the receptor activity. The plasma prostacyclin level of the patients with acute ischemic heart disease was similar to that of normal volunteers; this finding indicated that the defective receptor function was not related to the prostaglandin receptors occupancy in vivo. The impaired receptor activity was temporary in nature. The follow-up studies showed that the prostaglandin receptor activity of the patients' platelets improved to \"normal\" levels within 2-8 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MNL membranes were ADP-ribosylated in vitro in the presence of pertussis or cholera toxin. The amount of pertussis toxin substrates did not differ significantly between CHF patients (6,100 +/- 224 fmol/mg, n = 23) and age-matched healthy control subjects (5,812 +/- 972 fmol/mg protein, n = 19). Among the CHF patients, no differences were observed between those with idiopathic and ischemic CHF. The amount of cholera toxin substrates also did not differ significantly between CHF patients (7,522 +/- 1,405 fmol/mg protein, n = 11) and control subjects (5,654 +/- 707 fmol/mg protein, n = 14). Moreover, basal and isoproterenol- and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in MNL was similar in control subjects and patients. To detect more subtle alterations of the cAMP-generating system, we incubated anticoagulated blood with 250-400 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 4 hours at 37 degrees C. This treatment completely ADP-ribosylated the MNL pertussis toxin substrates. Incubation with pertussis toxin did not change basal or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP generation in MNL of control subjects, but it significantly enhanced stimulated generation (443 +/- 44 vs. 643 +/- 93 pmol/10(7) cells, p less than 0.025) in MNL of CHF patients. This enhancement was most pronounced in the most severely ill patients (New York Heart Association class IV) and correlated with plasma norepinephrine levels, another marker of CHF severity (r = 0.798, n = 11, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were two deaths because of myocardial infarctions, two nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and six cases of acute bronchospasm. Chest pain occurred in 770 patients (19.7%). Headache and dizziness were reported by 476 patients (12.2%) and 460 patients (11.8%), respectively. ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram were seen in 292 patients (7.5%). Use of parenteral aminophylline to treat adverse events associated with intravenous dipyridamole brought complete relief of symptoms in 439 of 454 patients (96.7%). There is a potential for increased risk for serious ischemic events in patients with a history of unstable angina who are administered intravenous dipyridamole. In patients with acutely unstable angina (i.e., continuing chest pain) or in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, use of intravenous dipyridamole in thallium scintigraphy should be avoided. There is also an increased risk for bronchospasm in patients with a history of asthma; acute bronchospasm can be relieved immediately by administration of aminophylline. These results demonstrate that intravenous dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy is a relatively safe, noninvasive technique for the evaluation of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated a diminution in the bioactivity of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase (Gs) in hearts of the hypertrophic BIO 14.6 Syrian hamster. In this study, we measured functional activity and immunodetectable levels of Gs in a mutant strain of hamsters (BIO 53.58) that develop a dilated cardiomyopathy. Pathological studies demonstrated that 100-day-old BIO 53.58 hamsters had substantial ventricular dilation when compared with age-matched F1B controls. Additionally, these 100-day-old hamsters demonstrated diminished contractile response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The pathological and hemodynamic changes were associated with defective coupling of Gs to adenylyl cyclase as adenylyl cyclase activation was distinctly decreased in the presence of isoproterenol, fluoride ion, guanine nucleotides, and forskolin. Additionally, the ability of the alpha-subunit of Gs to reconstitute isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes was reduced approximately 65%. By contrast, cyc- complementation assays did not reveal a difference between the functional activity of Gs in hearts from 30-day-old BIO 53.58 hamsters and F1B controls. Furthermore, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the membranes of the young BIO 53.58 hamsters was not significantly different from controls. The substantial alterations in Gs bioactivity in hearts of the 100-day-old BIO 53.58 hamsters was not associated with alterations in the immunodetectable levels of either alpha Gs or alpha Gi on Western Blots. These results suggest that G protein changes are associated with ventricular dilation in BIO 53.58 hamsters and that G protein levels are not always reflective of G protein bioactivity.\r"

Absorption-enhancing agents that rendered the approach feasible were identified, but large amounts of activator were required and initial elevations of concentrations in plasma could not be sustained. The present study was designed to determine whether more therapeutically favorable plasma concentrations could be induced by genetically engineering or chemically modifying t-PA to prolong its half-life based on the hypothesis that the ratio of absorption to clearance would be increased. Each of four genetically engineered variants (one variant with growth factor and kringle 1 domains deleted and kringle 2 duplicated, a second variant with a cysteine for Arg substitution in the growth factor domain, a third variant with an additional urokinase kringle inserted, and a fourth variant with the growth factor domain deleted) and enzymatically deglycosylated t-PA exhibited prolonged half-life after bolus intravenous injection in rabbits. Each elicited substantially higher and more sustained elevations in plasma after intramuscular injection in rabbits or dogs with absorption-enhancing agents as compared with wild-type t-PA that were not accompanied by a systemic lytic state. Thus, use of molecular variants of t-PA with prolonged half-lives in the circulation permits induction of augmented and sustained elevations of plasma concentrations after intramuscular injection with absorption-enhancing agents as compared with wild-type t-PA, rendering potentially therapeutic blood levels more attainable with relatively modest amounts of material.\r"

After a follow-up period of one to two years, there was a statistically significant difference in the infection rate between the two groups in favor of the gentamicin cement. After five years or more, the difference was unaltered. Altogether, 16 deep infections had occurred in the SA group (1.9%) and seven (0.8%) in the GBC group. Roentgenographically, aseptic loosening had occurred in 29% and 24% of the hips in the SA and GBC groups, respectively, which suggests that admixture of the antibiotic did not weaken the cement. The results of this five-year review clearly showed the prophylactic value of gentamicin cement against deep infection after THA but did not support the hypothesis that this effect was prolonged over one year.\r"

  ".U": "90200340\r", 
  ".W": "1. The effects of increasing glucose intake on nitrogen balance, energy expenditure and fuel utilization were measured in 12 malnourished adult patients receiving parenteral nutrition with constant, very high nitrogen intake (500 mg of N/kg), high (105 kJ/kg) or low (30 kJ/kg) glucose intake and constant fat intake (7 kJ/kg). Each patient received each diet for 8-day periods in random order. 2. Energy balance and nitrogen balance were determined daily. Blood samples, taken at admission, during 5% (w/v) dextrose (D-glucose) infusion and at the end of days 7 and 8 of each diet, were analysed for urea, glucose, lactate, triacylglycerols, fatty acids, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate, insulin and glucagon. 3. The effect of increasing glucose intake was to increase nitrogen balance by 0.60 +/- 0.25 (SEM) mg/kJ. At zero energy balance, nitrogen balance was 48 mg day-1 kg-1. This confirms findings of previous studies: that the effects of glucose on nitrogen balance are greater at high than at low nitrogen intakes, and that, in malnourished patients, unlike in normal adults, markedly positive nitrogen balance can be achieved at zero or negative energy balances. 4. Changes in nitrogen balance were due almost entirely to changes in urea excretion. 5. The high nitrogen intake markedly increased plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations and reduced glycerol, fatty acid and 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, independent of any glucose effect. Glucagon concentrations were significantly decreased by added glucose intake, an effect not previously seen at low nitrogen intakes. At this high nitrogen intake, the effects of added glucose appear to be mediated by both insulin and glucagon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. We have used n.m.r. spectroscopy to measure rubidium concentrations in the skeletal muscle of live intact rats. Using a 1.9 T superconducting magnet and an ear-phone coil tuned to both protons (1H) and rubidium (87Rb), it was possible to make measurements of both tissue rubidium content and water content, and from these measurements to obtain the rubidium concentration. 2. The n.m.r. estimate of rubidium concentration in muscle in vivo was found to be a constant 31% (SEM 4%) of that estimated by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy in an extract of excised muscle. This is close to the predicted theoretical n.m.r. visibility of 33%. The visibility was constant for muscle rubidium concentrations ranging between 10 and 34 mmol/l. 3. Rubidium concentration measurement by this method is unaffected by variations in sample geometry, sample volume, tissue conductivity, coil tuning and amplifier gain. 4. By using this method to measure changes in tissue rubidium concentration with time in the same animal, it should now be possible to assess the activity of ion transport systems, such as sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase in vivo, by measuring the rates of change of tissue rubidium concentrations during the administration of rubidium salts. 5. This method could also be used to measure the absolute concentration of any n.m.r.-visible nucleus and could be applied to man.\r"

In order to examine the potential role of atrial natriuretic factor in modulating the increased sodium excretion per nephron in chronic renal failure, we studied 12 uraemic patients on the last day of two successive 7 day periods during which their sodium intake was 100 and 20 mmol of sodium/day, respectively. 2. There was a parallel decrease from 6.31 +/- 0.75 to 2.17 +/- 0.32% in the fractional excretion of filtered sodium and from 234.4 +/- 74.9 to 80.6 +/- 20.3 pg/ml (supine position) or 140.1 +/- 43.6 to 60.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml (upright position) in plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Both parameters were significantly correlated during the two periods of different sodium intake (P less than 0.05). The ratio of plasma guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate to plasma creatinine changed proportionally to plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity increased during the sodium-depleted period but only plasma renin activity was significantly correlated with fractional excretion of filtered sodium. 3. The predominant role of atrial natriuretic factor compared with that of aldosterone in the renal response to varying sodium intake is suggested both by regression analysis and by the effect of 5 day's treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) in six other uraemic patients on a normal (100 mmol/day) sodium intake. Such treatment, although resulting in a significant increase in plasma renin activity and a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone, at least in the supine position, did not modify the fractional excretion of sodium and plasma atrial natriuretic factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, there is a difference between PaCO2 and end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PetCO2). This gradient P(a-et)CO2 is due to ventilation/perfusion mismatching and deadspace, and is usually abolished by forced and prolonged expiration. We hypothesized that this gradient might not be canceled by forced expiration in the case of acute respiratory failure (ARF) related to pulmonary embolism (PE). Forty-four adult COPD patients were prospectively entered into this study; they were suspected of having ARF related to PE on the basis of clinical and biological data on admission. Maximum expired partial pressure of CO2 (PemCO2) was measured in mechanically ventilated and sedated patients by an interrupt of mechanical support. CO2 concentration was recorded during the following prolonged and passive expiration. The test was considered valid if an expiratory plateau was obtained. PemCO2 was measured in triplicate. Simultaneously, PaCO2 was measured and the ratio, R = [( 1-PemCO2]/PaCO2) x 100, was calculated. Pulmonary angiography was performed on the same day for all patients. Results showed that 17 patients had PE (PE+) and 17 had no PE (PE-). The two groups were comparable regarding mean age, severity of underlying chronic respiratory disease, PaCO2, PaO2, and hemodynamic data on admission. P(a-em)CO2 and R were significantly different in PE+ and PE- patients at 12 +/- 6.9 torr compared to 1 +/- 2.4 torr and at 28 +/- 14.8% compared to 2 +/- 6.2% (p less than .001), respectively. The positive predictive value of the test was 74%, but the negative predictive value 100% and the specificity was 65%, but sensitivity was 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Capnography is a valuable tool in the management of cardiac arrest, since end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) correlates well with cardiac output and there are no other suitable noninvasive ways to measure this important variable during resuscitation. Animal studies also suggest that PetCO2 correlates well with the likelihood of resuscitation, but this has never been confirmed in humans. We prospectively studied 55 adult, nontraumatic prehospital cardiac arrest patients. PetCO2 was monitored with an in-line sensor on arrival in the ED and throughout the arrest, which was managed by the usual advanced cardiac life-support treatment guidelines. Chest compression was carried out mechanically. Patients were assessed for return of spontaneous pulse as evidence of initial resuscitation; hospital discharge and long-term survival were not examined. Fourteen patients developed spontaneous pulses and were resuscitated, and 41 were not. The length and aggressiveness of treatment and CPR were not different between the two groups, nor were there differences in down time, resuscitation time, or other factors known to affect outcome. Patients who developed a pulse had a mean PetCO2 of 19 +/- 14 (SD) torr at the start of resuscitation, and those who did not had a mean PetCO2 of 5 +/- 4 torr (p less than .0001). This difference was significant both in nonperfusing rhythms (asystole and ventricular fibrillation) and in potentially perfusing rhythms (electromechanical dissociation). An initial PetCO2 of 15 torr correctly predicted eventual return of pulse with a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 91%. A receiver operating curve was generated for sensitivity and specificity of the test at varying PetCO2 thresholds.\r"

The patients were coupled to a respirator, and the FIO2 was maintained at 0.3 except for two 30-min periods of ventilation with 100% oxygen. Oxygen exposures occurred 1 and 8 h after ICU admission. Transcutaneous PO2 (PtcO2), subcutaneous PO2 (PscO2), laser-Doppler skin red cell flux (RCF), and peripheral skin temperature (Tft) were recorded continuously in the upper extremity. The opening of peripheral circulation was reflected as an increase of cardiac index and a decline of mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Concurrently, the Tft, PscO2, and RCF rose clearly, whereas the PtcO2 remained unchanged. During both periods of oxygen ventilation, the PaO2 similarly rose and was closely followed by an increase in PtcO2. The PscO2 showed no response to the first period of systemic hyperoxia, but increased promptly during the second exposure to oxygen. To summarize, peripheral tissue oxygenation in postoperative cardiac patients cannot be efficiently elevated by systemic hyperoxia until the peripheral vascular bed is opened.\r"

Consequent to decreases in DPH protein binding in such patients, the DPH free fraction (DPHff) may increase and thereby produce symptoms compatible with DPH toxicity despite the presence of total serum concentrations within the usually accepted therapeutic range. We examined the effect of acute traumatic injury on DPH protein binding in 13 hospitalized pediatric patients. In addition to total and free DPH serum concentrations, biochemical variables including blood pH, total and direct bilirubin, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), and free fatty acid concentrations were measured serially over 10 days. The DPHff was compared between selected time intervals in hospitalized patients and data obtained in a control population of 27 epileptic outpatients who were maintained on DPH. Additionally, a multiple regression model was used to examine for covariance between the DPHff and the respective biochemical variables in the hospitalized patients. In the study patients, the DPHff progressively increased, attaining a maximum value (8.5 +/- 0.7%) on the fifth hospital day which was significantly greater (6.4 +/- 0.7%, p less than .05) than that on day 1 and also in the control group (6.1 +/- 0.3%; p less than .01). Blood pH, serum albumin, free fatty acids, creatinine and bilirubin concentrations did not change, but GGT did increase significantly over the 10-day sampling period. A significant (r = .51, p less than .0001) linear relationship was found between the DPHff and the serum albumin concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After instrumentation and obtaining baseline values for BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP), CVP, cardiac output, extravascular lung water (EVLW), and blood gases (mixed venous and arterial), animals were rapidly exsanguinated to an MAP of 50 mm Hg. After 30 min at this pressure, measurements were repeated and 5% ALR was administered until two of three variables (WP, MAP, cardiac output) were restored to baseline values. The administration of 5% ALR was continued as needed to maintain baseline values of these variables. Sixty minutes later, data were again recorded. For induction of shock, 15.7 +/- 5.2 ml of blood/kg body weight was removed. Pulmonary artery pressure, WP, MAP, and cardiac output all significantly decreased with shock. After resuscitation, all values except MAP returned to baseline. The resuscitation volume of 5% ALR was 25.2 +/- 18.4 ml/kg. There were no changes in EVLW or intrapulmonary shunt. Oxygen delivery was significantly compromised during shock but returned to baseline after resuscitation. We conclude that in a model such as ours, 5% ALR can reverse the hemodynamic effects of acute hemorrhagic shock.\r"

We found significant increases in the intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), pulmonary (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), alveolar-arterial PO2 difference (P[A-a] O2), and peak airway pressure (Paw), but decreases in PaO2 and pH. These cardiopulmonary hemodynamic changes were similar to those found in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study showed that Qsp/Qt (r = .72, p less than .001), PaO2 (r = -.60, p less than .01), P(A-a)O2 (r = .55, p less than .01), pH (r = -.55, p less than .01), MPAP (r = .50, p less than .05) and Paw (r = .49, p less than .05) significantly correlated linearly with W/D. The significant correlation is not high enough clinically to predict the severity of acute permeability pulmonary edema considering only one parameter of cardiopulmonary hemodynamic change. Therefore, we propose the possible prediction of the severity of ARDS by considering all of the above hemodynamic changes together with Paw or dynamic compliance.\r"

We measured the LES pressure in 118 patients with chronic Chagas' disease, 14 patients with idiopathic achalasia, and 50 control subjects using a perfused catheter and the stationary pull-through (SPT) technique. The patients with Chagas' disease had normal esophageal radiologic examination (group A, N = 50), delay in esophageal clearance without dilatation (group B, N = 41), or delay in esophageal clearance with dilatation (group C, N = 27). The LES pressure of Chagas' disease patients of group A (18.6 +/- 9.1 mm Hg, mean +/- SD), group B (17.8 +/- 9.7 mm Hg), and group C (21.6 +/- 10.1 mm Hg) was lower (P less than 0.001) than the LES pressure of the controls (24.9 +/- 10.2 mm Hg). In patients with idiopathic achalasia, the LES pressure (40.7 +/- 17.8 mm Hg) was higher than in control subjects (P less than 0.01) and Chagas' disease patients (P less than 0.001).

  ".W": "3 alpha-Hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP), can selectively release LH in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. This progesterone metabolite does not bind to the progesterone receptor. Recently, 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP has been reported to be a potent modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor in the brain. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP's effect on gonadotropin secretion is GABAA receptor mediated. Ovariectomized immature rats were primed for 2 days with estradiol (2 micrograms/rat.day). On the morning of the third day, 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP was administered either with or without prior treatment with progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486) or the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin. When 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP was administered alone, a dose-related effect on LH and FSH release was observed. The 0.8 mg/kg BW dose of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP stimulated both LH and FSH release, whereas the 1.6 mg/kg BW dose released only LH. The GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin had no significant effect on LH or FSH secretion. However, administration of picrotoxin 30 min before 0.8 mg/kg BW 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP resulted in antagonism of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP's ability to release LH and FSH. The effects of 1.6 mg/kg BW 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP on serum LH were also blocked by picrotoxin. Picrotoxin was ineffective in altering the gonadotropin-stimulating response of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone. These steroids do not bind to the GABAA receptor. The progesterone receptor antagonist RU486 administered alone had no effect on serum LH or FSH levels. When RU486 was administered before 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP treatment, it was ineffective in blocking 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP's ability to release LH. These studies indicate that the GABAA receptor is responsible for mediating 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP-induced gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90200890\r", 
  ".W": "Recent data have shown that pretreatment of bovine adrenal fasciculata cells with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or insulin enhances the steroidogenic response to angiotensin II (A-II). In the present work we have studied the effects of both peptides on the first steps of the mechanism of action of A-II and on the amounts of pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding proteins (Gi proteins). Both peptides increased A-II-induced phosphoinositide breakdown without modification of either A-II-induced Ca2+ uptake or the A-II-potentiating effect on ACTH-induced cAMP production. The effects of IGF-I at a nanomolar concentration were higher than those induced by insulin at a micromolar concentration, which in turn was higher than those induced by a nanomolar concentration of this peptide. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) for 24 h reduced by 25% of the A-II-induced phosphoinositide breakdown in control cells and 32% and 28% in cells pretreated with insulin at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively, but had no significant effect in cells pretreated with IGF-I. No effect of pertussis toxin was observed on A-II-induced Ca2+ uptake or on its potentiating action on ACTH-induced cAMP production. Moreover, both IGF-I and insulin enhanced the amounts of Gi protein(s) evaluated by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation or immunoblotting. Again, the effects of insulin at nanomolar concentrations were lower than those induced by the same concentrations of IGF-I or insulin at micromolar concentrations. These results suggest that, in bovine adrenal fasciculata cells, A-II receptors are coupled to the phosphoinositide pathway through pertussis toxin sensitive and insensitive Gp protein(s). Moreover, the findings also indicate that the enhanced A-II responsiveness of IGF-I or insulin treated cells is in part mediated through an increase in the amount of G protein(s).\r"

  ".U": "90200917\r", 
  ".W": "In GH4C1 rat pituitary cells, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) causes amplification of both the TRH-induced spike phase in cytosolic free calcium [( Ca2+]i) and the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization with K+. In the present study we investigated the actions of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on Ca2(+)-homeostasis in GH4C1 cells pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 h. In control and 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated cells, incubation with TPA (0.1-300 nM) for 15 min in the presence of 45Ca2+ did not affect the basal uptake of 45Ca2+. However, if the cells were treated with 50 mM K+, TPA induced a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in depolarization-induced net 45Ca2+ uptake. A maximal decrease of 30-50% was observed with 100-300 nM TPA, 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells being more responsive to the action of TPA than control cells. sn-1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, which mimics the action of TPA on protein kinase C (PKC), did not alter depolarization-induced uptake of 45Ca2+. Two agents which inhibit PKC activity, polymyxin B and K252A, did not prevent the effect of TPA on depolarization-induced uptake of 45Ca2+, whereas staurosporin totally inhibited the action of TPA. In Fura-2 loaded cells pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3, incubation with 200 nM TPA for 9 min decreased the depolarization-induced spike and plateau phases of change in [Ca2+]i; only the spike phase was decreased in control cells. TPA did not affect basal [Ca2+]i in either group. Treatment with TPA for only 3 min decreased the TRH-induced spike in [Ca2+]i only in 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells; however, after a 5-min treatment with TPA, the TRH-induced spike in [Ca2+]i was decreased in both control and 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells. TPA did not affect the spike in [Ca2+] induced by 50 nM ionomycin. Na+/Ca2+ exchange was not altered by TPA, nor did TPA enhance efflux of 45Ca2+ from cells preloaded with 45Ca2+ for 2.5 h. We conclude that, in GH4C1 cells, TPA modulates plasma membrane calcium flux, probably via an inhibitory action on voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. This inhibitory action may be independent of activation of PKC, and 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells are more responsive to the actions of TPA than are control cells. These results are consistent with our previous findings that 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity in GH4C1 cells.\r"

  ".U": "90200918\r", 
  ".W": "Although the existence of plasminogen activator (PA) activity and the factors that regulate it in ovarian granulosa cells of both mammalian and avian species have been extensively documented, very little information has been generated concerning the control of PA activity in the adjacent thecal layer. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of several physiological and pharmacological agents on PA activity in dispersed cells from the thecal layer of the largest preovulatory follicle in the hen ovary 17-16 h before ovulation. LH (50 and 100 ng) in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.01 mM) stimulated an approximate 25% increase in cell-associated PA activity, possibly via elevated levels of cAMP. Prostaglandin E1 and E2 (PGE1 and PGE2; 0.1 and 1 microM), but not PGI2 or PGF2 alpha (1 microM), enhanced PA activity and cAMP formation, effects that were potentiated by 0.01 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Activation of Gs with cholera toxin (0.01-10 ng/tube) or adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (0.01-10 microM) stimulated cAMP formation and PA activity in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1-5 mM) caused similar increases in thecal cell PA activity. Incubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 3.2-162 nM), an agonist known to activate protein kinase-C, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PA activity. However, an equimolar concentration of phorbol 13-monoacetate (162 nM), an inactive analog of PMA that does not activate protein kinase-C, was without effect. Coincubation of cells with forskolin (1 microM) and PMA (32 nM) resulted in a synergistic stimulation of secreted PA activity, apparently via an enhancement of adenylyl cyclase activity. Treatment of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1 microM) suppressed basal PA activity. However, PA activity stimulated by PMA (32 nM) was synergistically increased after coincubation with a 0.05-microM concentration of A23187, but was inhibited at doses of 0.5 and 1 microM. Taken collectively, the data indicate that PA activity is present in the thecal layer of the largest preovulatory follicle in the ovary of the domestic hen. Furthermore, several endocrine factors (i.e. LH and PGs) were found to stimulate PA activity, possibly via both the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase-A and phosphoinositide-protein kinase-C pathways. In light of these findings, we propose that the preovulatory increase in PGs and LH activates PA in the thecal layer of the largest preovulatory follicle, resulting in proteolytic degradation of the follicular connective tissue and, ultimately, ovulation.\r"

  ".U": "90200923\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this experiment was to examine directly whether inhibin is involved in the testicular regulation of FSH secretion in the male rhesus monkey. To this end, the pituitary-testicular axis in eight juvenile monkeys was prematurely activated by a chronic iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min every 3 h). After a minimum of 5 weeks of pulsatile GnRH stimulation, four animals received a brief (30-min) iv infusion of an ovine antiserum to inhibin alpha-subunit (approximately 10 ml/kg BW), and four monkeys received a comparable volume of a control ovine immune serum. The pulsatile GnRH infusion continued without interruption throughout the entire experiment. The FSH response to passive immunization against inhibin was determined by measuring concentrations of this gonadotropin in sequential plasma samples collected immediately before a GnRH infusion and for 3 h thereafter (an inter-GnRH pulse interval) on days 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 after injection of the immune serum. Administration of the antiserum to inhibin alpha-subunit resulted, within 2 days, in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the mean concentration and pulse amplitude of plasma FSH. The hypersecretion of FSH induced by administration of the antiserum to inhibin alpha-subunit was maintained until day 4, and then mean concentrations and mean pulse amplitudes of plasma FSH declined, reaching preantibody control levels by day 16. The time course of the antiserum-induced hypersecretion of FSH was closely correlated to changes in circulating inhibin-binding activity. Most importantly, the hypersecretion of FSH observed during the first 2 days after immunoneutralization of circulating inhibin was indistinguishable from that elicited during the initial 2 days after subsequent bilateral orchidectomy and concomitant testosterone (T) replacement. Administration of a control immune serum did not influence circulating FSH concentrations, and neither the antiserum to inhibin alpha-subunit nor the control immune serum induced changes in pituitary LH secretion and testicular T release. Since the exogenous drive to the pituitary-testicular axis of the animals was clamped in a mode that produced a pattern of pulsatile LH and T secretion comparable to that observed in adult monkeys, the present findings provide evidence for the view that inhibin plays a major role in the testicular regulation of FSH secretion during adulthood by exerting a selective inhibition on the secretion of this gonadotropin directly at the level of the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".U": "90200925\r", 
  ".W": "The membrane fraction from the ovaries of pseudopregnant rats exhibits specific, high affinity binding of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Previous studies have indicated that HDL binding in this tissue is up-regulated by hCG and may be involved in supplying cholesterol as substrate for steroid hormone production. To characterize the HDL-binding activity, we solubilized the membrane proteins using 40 mM beta-octylglucoside and then separated them by electrophoresis on a 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and subsequently incubated in the presence of [125I]apolipoprotein-E-free HDL. Autoradiography of the nitrocellulose revealed that the labeled HDL was bound to a single major band, with an apparent mol wt of 58,000 daltons. Neither reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol nor heat denaturation before separation on the gel affected the molecular size of the band, which indicates that it is probably a single polypeptide chain. The band was up-regulated in this tissue by in vivo treatment with 25 IU hCG in a time-dependent manner similar to the up-regulation of [125I]HDL-binding activity. In contrast to the binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to its receptor, the binding of HDL is independent of Ca+2. Incubation of the transferred proteins in the presence of [125I] Incubation of the transferred proteins in the presence of [125I]apolipoprotein-E-free HDL and either 5 mM CaCl2 or 15 mM EDTA had no effect on the appearance of the 58-kDa band. Furthermore, ligand blotting in the presence of a 100-fold excess of LDL did not affect the appearance of the band, whereas a 100-fold excess of apoliprotein-E-free HDL caused the disappearance of the band, indicating specificity for binding of HDL. Treatment of the sample with trypsin before electrophoresis also caused the band to disappear, revealing the protein nature of the band. These experiments indicate that the HDL receptor in luteinized rat ovaries is a 58,000-dalton protein.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGF-BPs) purified from porcine follicular fluid on granulosa cell function were examined using serum-free cultures of rat granulosa cells obtained from immature, diethylstilbestrol-treated rats. Both the so-called GH-dependent (IGF-BP3) and non-GH-dependent (IGF-BP2) proteins dose dependently inhibited granulosa cell estradiol and progesterone production with IC50s of 4.1-7.6 nM for IGF-BP3 and 12.6-12.9 nM for IGF-BP2, the actual value depending upon the steroid being measured. A specific antiserum directed against IGF-I also dose dependently suppressed both estradiol and progesterone production, although the effect on the latter was more marked. Experiments using cells that were primed with FSH to induce functional LH receptors showed that the inhibitory action of IGF-BP3 was specific to FSH. However, both IGF-BP3 and IGF-BP2 were capable of inhibiting both forskolin- and cholera toxin-stimulated steroidogenesis, confirming that neither compound was competing with FSH for binding to its receptor. Neither IGF-BP had any effect on either basal or FSH-stimulated cAMP production, while exogenously added IGF-I was stimulatory in this respect. However, both IGF-BPs inhibited FSH-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake by the granulosa cells, while IGF-I had no effect on this parameter, suggestive of an IGF-independent effect on granulosa cell proliferation. Our data suggest that IGF-BPs have a multifaceted mode of action on granulosa cell function, and may therefore be an important regulator of follicular growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "90200934\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously observed 3- to 10-fold increases in pituitary LH beta-subunit mRNA levels in the rat 28 days after castration. These changes correlate with increases in percentages and areas of cells that bear the LH beta mRNA and with the amount of label for mRNA per cell. In contrast, FSH beta mRNA levels increase 2.5- to 4-fold 7-14 days after castration, decline to near-intact levels 28 days postcastration, and rise 4.5-fold by 96 days postcastration. The purpose of this study was to determine morphological correlates of these changes in FSH beta mRNA levels. Dispersed pituitary cells from intact and castrated rats were analyzed for FSH beta and LH beta mRNAs and protein by in situ hybridization techniques and immunocytochemistry, respectively. In intact animals over 79% of pituitary cells labeled for FSH beta mRNA were small (area less than 150 microns 2). However, 7 days after castration, the average area of labeled cells increased 4-fold (80% were over 200 microns 2 in area), without a significant change in percentages of FSH beta mRNA-containing cells. The amount of mRNA per cell (as measured by area of label per cell) increased 6-fold. Fourteen days after castration, the average area of cells containing FSH beta mRNA decreased to 2 times that in intact rats (48% were greater than 200 microns 2). The percentage of labeled cells increased from 11% (intact) to 20%. Furthermore, the dual labeling studies showed that 37% of these FSH cells were monohormonal (detected by FSH beta mRNA, but not LH beta antigen) compared with 23% in intact rats. At this same time, the FSH cells exhibited a decrease in the amount of mRNA per cell. In 21- to 84-day castrates, average areas of FSH beta mRNA remained at 2-2.5 times the areas of cells from intact rats. In addition, 21 days after surgery the percentages of labeled cells and amount of FSH beta mRNA per cell declined to those in intact rats. A greater proportion was multihormonal (only 15% expressed FSH beta mRNA but not LH beta antigens). At 84 days there were 2-fold increases in the percentages of labeled cells and the density of label, which correlate with the recovery in mRNA levels assayed at 96 days. Thus, factors that contribute to the early rise in FSH beta mRNA include increases in the amount of mRNA per cell, which coincides with increased cell area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen patients undergoing surgical evaluation were studied with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) interictally and had intensive extracranial and intracranial electrophysiologic evaluations. Eight patients had left temporal lobe seizure foci, six had right temporal lobe foci, and two had right posterotemporal or parietal foci. The PET data were analyzed visually and quantitatively, using a multivariate analysis of variance on the quantitative data. Hypometabolism of subcortical nuclei was present ipsilateral to the cortical seizure focus. Cortical hypometabolism was noted focally in the temporal lobe in patients with left temporal lobe seizure foci, whereas patients with right temporal lobe seizure foci had diffuse hemispheric hypometabolism. We postulate that the subcortical hypometabolism is secondary to decreased efferent activity from temporal lobe structures, in particular amygdala and hippocampus, to subcortical nuclei. Diminished subcortical activity may then lead to defective regulation of cortical excitability in the temporal lobe, increasing the likelihood of seizure development and spread.\r"

The characteristic increase in serum levels of bioactive LH and T were absent. Follicular fluid estradiol and T concentrations, and serum progesterone were not different. The lower circulating levels of T may reflect reduced LH-stimulated androgen accumulation in smaller nonaspirated follicles and may account for the enhanced follicle recruitment observed during LA. The lack of premature luteinization despite marked rises of bioactive LH in the absence of LA is consistent with normal events during the menstrual cycle and was due to the early termination of hMG stimulation.\r"
