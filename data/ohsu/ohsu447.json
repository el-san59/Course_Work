  ".W": "Recovery of contractile function of myocardium stunned by a brief, transient period of regional ischemia is highly variable. In our experience, segment shortening (an index of regional systolic contractile function) assessed during the initial hours after a 15-minute period of coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized open-chest dogs ranged from -84 to +99% of normal preocclusion values. In this retrospective study, regression analysis was used to assess the effects of various parameters on segment shortening 2 hours after reperfusion. Parameters assessed included regional myocardial blood flow both during occlusion and after reperfusion, high-energy phosphate content of previously ischemic tissue, systemic hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure and double product), occluded bed size and segment shortening measured during coronary artery occlusion. Recovery of systolic contractile function was not influenced by the degree of ischemia during coronary artery occlusion, myocardial blood flow after reperfusion, high-energy phosphate content, hemodynamic parameters or occluded bed size (correlation coefficients, r, ranged from 0.001 to 0.37 [p = not significant]). Only the degree of dyskinesia/hypokinesia exhibited during coronary occlusion significantly and reliably predicted recovery of segment shortening measured 2 hours after reflow (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). Thus, recovery of systolic contractile function in the anesthetized canine model of the stunned myocardium is determined primarily by the degree of dysfunction exhibited during the preceding period of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve patients (10 men and 2 women), mean age 60.6 years (range 50 to 75), with stable angina pectoris were administered propranolol until beta blockade was evident. Treadmill exercise testing was performed, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded, and serum propranolol levels were assessed at 1 and 2 hours after dosing with propranolol alone, and after 2 weeks of combined therapy with either nifedipine, 10 or 20 mg, or diltiazem, 60 or 120 mg, administered every 8 hours. Patients were assigned to treatment regimens in randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. At the time of exercise testing, maximal exercise time, time to angina, peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were measured. The rate-pressure product was also calculated. Maximal exercise time increased from 708 +/- 140 seconds with propranolol alone to 795 +/- 156 seconds after combined propranolol-nifedipine therapy (p less than 0.05), and to 790 +/- 107 seconds (p less than 0.05) after propranolol-diltiazem therapy. Time to onset of angina increased from 472 +/- 191 seconds with propranolol alone to 564 +/- 123 seconds (p = NS) after propranolol-nifedipine treatment and to 607 +/- 197 seconds (p less than 0.05) after propranolol-diltiazem treatment. Peak exercise heart rate remained unchanged with propranolol-nifedipine therapy (103 +/- 16 beats/min vs 104 +/- 17 with propranolol alone). However, with propranolol-diltiazem therapy, peak exercise heart rate significantly decreased to 95 +/- 14 beats/min (p less than 0.05); peak systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure products were comparable on all treatment regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently, attention has focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function. When administered in vitro to the isolated perfused kidney, calcium antagonists exhibit predictable actions allowing for characterization of their renal effects. Calcium antagonists do not affect the vasodilated isolated perfused kidney; however, they do dramatically alter the response of the kidney to vasoconstrictor agents. In the presence of norepinephrine, calcium antagonists markedly augment the glomerular filtration rate but produce only a modest improvement in renal perfusion. A study using the postischemic hydronephrotic rat kidney model that permits direct visualization of afferent and efferent arterioles, this study demonstrated that this preferential augmentation of the glomerular filtration rate is primarily attributable to a selective vasodilation of pre-glomerular vessels. Although the clinical implications of such observations are not yet clear, preliminary studies in experimental animal models indicate that calcium antagonists might exert salutary effects on renal function in clinical settings characterized by impaired renal hemodynamics. The possible benefits of calcium antagonists in ameliorating the development of renal dysfunction in patients in whom there is increased risk of acute renal insufficiency remain to be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of nifedipine and propranolol on cardiac function both at rest and at peak exercise were compared in 22 hypertensive patients whose diastolic blood pressures remained in excess of 95 mm Hg despite diuretic therapy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function at rest and at peak exercise during bicycle ergometry was assessed by first-pass radionuclide angiography using the Baird Scinticor before and after treatment with either nifedipine or propranolol. Both agents effectively reduced blood pressure in the supine and upright positions and at peak exercise. Nifedipine was associated with a significant increase in cardiac output and stroke volume at rest and at peak exercise, while propranolol decreased cardiac output at rest and at peak exercise. Systemic vascular resistance decreased with nifedipine treatment at rest and at peak exercise, but increased significantly with propranolol. Nifedipine increased ejection fraction in patients at rest and also increased maximal oxygen consumption at peak exercise, while propranolol decreased maximal oxygen consumption at peak exercise. At rest and at peak exercise, nifedipine increased peak filling rate, but time to peak filling rate was not affected by either drug. The fraction of total diastolic filling at the midpoint of diastole was significantly increased by nifedipine therapy at rest but was not affected by propranolol therapy. Nifedipine significantly decreased atrial filling volume while propranolol had no effect. Propranolol therapy did not result in any improvement in left ventricular function. In contrast, nifedipine improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function at rest and peak exercise. Future selection of an antihypertensive agent should include consideration of the impact of therapy on left ventricular function.\r"

Ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed on a day of usual activity in 54 subjects; a subgroup of 24 patients had evaluation of left ventricular dimensions and diastolic filling patterns by Doppler echocardiography. Average ambulatory systolic pressures of 42% of subjects were greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg. Only 35% had average diastolic pressures greater than or equal to 85 mm Hg, and 57% had either systolic or diastolic pressures greater than or equal to 130/85 mm Hg. Correlation between casual and ambulatory pressures was not significant. No subject had left ventricular hypertrophy determined by echocardiography. Abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling was noted in 38% of those patients with average ambulatory pressures greater than or equal to 130/85 mm Hg, but in no patients with average pressures less than 130/85 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be a specific method for detecting those patients with mild hypertension who may have early and potentially reversible cardiac abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "As the number of antihypertensive agents increases, the choice of optimal therapy becomes more difficult. Certainly, hemodynamic derangements caused by the disease state as well as therapy must be considered. Patient convenience and quality of life are also issues that must be addressed. Preliminary experience suggests that the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) push-pull osmotic pump formulation of nifedipine is safe and efficacious in the treatment of hypertension. In 1 study, nifedipine GITS was compared with sustained-release propranolol in patients with mild to moderate hypertension already receiving diuretics. Using a 2-week placebo run-in, double-blind study design, patients were randomly assigned to receive nifedipine GITS (n = 31) in doses of 30, 60 or 90 mg once daily, or sustained-release propranolol (n = 32) in doses of 80, 160 or 240 mg once daily. Previous diuretic therapy was continued. Sitting and 5-minute standing blood pressure and heart rate measurements were obtained 24 hours after dosing. At the end point of treatment, both nifedipine GITS and sustained-release propranolol reduced blood pressure compared with placebo (p less than 0.001) in the sitting and standing positions. Nifedipine GITS was more effective than sustained-release propranolol in reducing standing (p less than 0.005) and sitting (p less than 0.001) systolic blood pressure and sitting diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.02). Sustained-release propranolol caused a greater reduction in standing (p less than 0.001) and sitting (p less than 0.0006) resting heart rate than nifedipine GITS. Both drugs were well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postmortem blood alcohol results of individuals who died after less than 15 min of hospitalization were utilized to approximate alcohol levels at the time of the fatal injury. Relationships between types of accidents, sex, age, race, and time of accident were examined. White victims were far more likely to have been drinking than blacks, and the data indicated that underaged drinkers were involved in fatal accidents at lower levels of blood alcohol than their counterparts of legal drinking age. Consistent racial differences in average alcohol levels were not observed, however. Unlike female and black victims, who much less frequently tested positive for alcohol when underage, white male victims 16-21 years of age were just as likely to have been drinking as those aged 21-25. The results of the study show that postmortem blood alcohol level can be used to identify differences in alcohol consumption among groups of accident victims in a major metropolitan area.\r"

Of the total of 57 cases of cervical injury, routine postmortem examination identified 30 cases (52.6%), and the radiographic examinations identified 51 cases (89.5%). In the cases where it was performed, radiography identified 96.2% of injuries. One-half of injuries of level C3 and above were not reported at postmortem examination, compared with 22% of those occurring below this level. This finding correlates with the physical difficulties of examining the upper part of the cervical spine. This study has shown that lateral cervical radiography is a simple and effective method of more accurately identifying significant cervical spinal injuries, thus improving greatly the value of postmortem examinations in determining the patterns and mechanisms of these injuries.\r"

The nine cases that were collected are presented here in some detail. A discussion ensues concerning the most common type of accidental railway-related fatalities, why they occur, and what future work remains in order to avoid such fatalities. Evidently, fatalities more frequently result from victims' disregard for safety--either by crossing the tracks despite warning, or by utilizing railroad trestles as a fishing pier--than from mass disaster. Future work involving forensic engineers, forensic pathologists, and lawyers along with community activists should include both public education and a design of less accessible trestles to avoid such tragedies. In conclusion, it is hoped that this article will serve as a catalyst for further research on this subject.\r"

When postmortem duration is greater than 12 h, the cells become vacuolated and cannot be identified. The etiology of these findings requires further study.\r"

The annual mortality rates due to suicidal and accidental poisoning are 61% and 35.3%, respectively: 74% of the accidentally poisoned group are children less than 10 years, while 60.7% of the suicides are 15-24 years of age. To minimize such high mortality rates from pesticide poisoning, Jordan needs to adopt more protective measures by rigorous regulation.\r"

Necrotizing fasciitis should be considered a potentially serious problem that can follow minor trauma and eventually lead to death. The need for a high index of suspicion to make this diagnosis, along with the medicolegal implication of a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, are both addressed in this report. Also of note is the fact that this patient was treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for pain and inflammation, which has recently been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of fulminant evolution of necrotizing fasciitis.\r"

The pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated after single or repeated administration in healthy subjects, using labeled and unlabeled compounds. Rilmenidine was rapidly and extensively absorbed, with an absolute bioavailability close to one and a time to peak plasma concentration of two hours. Rilmenidine was not subjected to presystemic metabolism. Distribution was independent of the free fraction since rilmenidine was weakly bound to plasma proteins (less than 10 percent). The volume of distribution was approximately 5 liters/kg (315 liters). Elimination was rapid, with a total body plasma clearance of approximately 450 ml/minute and an elimination half-life of approximately eight hours. Renal excretion was the major elimination process (two thirds of the total clearance); the parent drug in urine accounted for about 65 percent of the dose administered. Metabolism was very poor; few metabolites were found in urine and no metabolites were detected in plasma. Linear pharmacokinetics was demonstrated for rilmenidine from 0.5 to 2 mg; at 3 mg, a slight deviation from linearity was observed. In repeated administration, the linearity with dose of the pharmacokinetics of rilmenidine was confirmed.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension, common in diabetic patients, worsens not only the risk of cardiovascular complications, but also that of microangiopathic complications (nephropathy, retinopathy) of diabetes mellitus. It is thus important to ensure the perfect control of even mild hypertension in diabetic patients. However, treatment sometimes becomes difficult given that certain categories of antihypertensive drugs interfere with blood glucose control and/or lipid metabolism, interfere with the symptomatology of hypoglycemia, or promote orthostatic hypotension, a complication of autonomic neuropathy. A study was undertaken to determine the effects of rilmenidine, administered for 16 weeks, in 29 diabetic patients treated with insulin and experiencing mild-to-moderate hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure, 96.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg). Administered as single-drug therapy, rilmenidine rapidly normalized blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, less than 160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure, no more than 90 mmHg--supine) in 17 patients; this persisted throughout the trial period. Addition of a diuretic after 12 weeks in the remaining 12 patients led to normalization of blood pressure in nine additional patients. Blood glucose control (evaluated at home by weekly blood glucose measurements and by glycosylated hemoglobin levels) was unaffected by treatment. Plasma levels of cholesterol (total, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein), triglycerides and proteinuria (or microalbuminuria) showed no change during the course of the trial. In conclusion, rilmenidine offers an effective and safe treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension in diabetic patients treated with insulin and does not interfere with their blood glucose control.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure in the elderly is well established. The concept that this was entirely due to hardening of the arteries and, therefore, an essential feature of aging has been revised in the last 15 years to show that there are groups of elderly people in whom hypertension is not a problem, and in this group stroke disease and heart failure are relatively uncommon. The treatment of hypertension in the elderly attracts increasing attention. The successful lowering of blood pressure in the elderly has now been reported by many authors with a variety of therapeutic agents. The case for treatment has been demonstrated in those up to 80 years of age by the European Working Party in Hypertension in the Elderly, and relevant data on compliance are also available in the older age group in the Sub-Group Analysis of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Programme. A similar reduction of blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, can be safely achieved with thiazides, beta-blockade, calcium channel blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and centrally acting drugs. The differentiation between these groups is largely a matter of the side effects that occur and any concurrent existing illness from which the patient suffers, e.g., diabetes, bronchitis, heart failure, and so on. From the information available to date, the problem of choice of the most suitable drug remains a clinical decision for the prescribing doctor.\r"

Patients were treated for six months with rilmenidine at the dose of 1 mg in the morning or 1 mg twice daily as single-drug therapy in untreated patients, or in combination or as substitution in patients already treated. Plasma concentrations of rilmenidine were measured by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry at Days 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, and 11, and Months 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 before administration. Supine and erect blood pressure (sphygmomanometer) measurements and side effects were noted at the same times. Laboratory and electrocardiographic parameters were evaluated at Days 0 and 11, and Months 1.5 and 6. Blood pressure was effectively controlled during the trial in 12 patients (mean decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 12/8 mmHg). Five patients were removed from the trial after Month 1.5 because of a rise in blood pressure (three cases) or noncompliance (two cases). Side effects were moderate and transient (dry mouth, constipation, daytime drowsiness, mood disturbances, insomnia) never requiring treatment withdrawal. Surveillance of renal function revealed no significant mean variation. Rilmenidine plasma concentrations reached steady state the fifth day at the latest and were related to the degree of renal insufficiency. When renal function was stable (13 cases), plasma concentrations did not vary until the end of the trial. When renal function was progressive (four cases), plasma concentrations increased in parallel in two patients, without the onset of side effects, and remained stable in the other two patients. In conclusion, this study confirmed the good acceptability of rilmenidine in hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency. It showed stable plasma concentrations of rilmenidine during a six-month treatment in hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency, reflecting the absence of accumulation of the drug.\r"

Patients not satisfactorily controlled received a combined therapy on the same doses of the two drugs used. Rilmenidine and hydrochlorothiazide induced a significant reduction (p = 0.01) of supine and erect systolic/diastolic blood pressure 23 hours after drug intake with no change in heart rate. This effect was due to a reduction in cardiac output (bioimpedance method) significant (p = 0.05) only for rilmenidine. Both drugs controlled the increase of effort systolic blood pressure in comparison with placebo on systemic vascular resistance treadmill exercise testing. Effort cardiac output was increased by each treatment in comparison with baseline values. Both at rest and on exertion, there was no effect on systemic vascular resistance induced by the two drugs. In a second group of 10 patients with moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 105 to 115 mmHg), rilmenidine 1 mg was administered in order to evaluate its efficacy and hemodynamic effects (bioimpedance and radionuclide ventriculography), at rest and during a lying cycloergometer effort test. The drug induced a significant decrease in blood pressure at rest and on exertion four hours after drug intake. This effect was due to a reduction (p = 0.05) in systemic vascular resistance, whereas cardiac output and heart rate remained unchanged. Our results show that the reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure induced by rilmenidine 1 mg is comparable with that induced by the well-known antihypertensive drug hydrochlorothiazide in mild hypertension. In moderate hypertension, the 1-mg dose appears to be insufficient in controlling the blood pressure in all patients. The drug exerts its antihypertensive effect through the normalization of the altered hemodynamic parameters of hypertension (high cardiac output and/or increased systemic vascular resistance). Rilmenidine also respects the physiologic increase in blood pressure and cardiac output on exertion.\r"

Beta-adrenergic blockers had little effect upon urinary composition, whereas diuretics caused significant urinary losses of fluid, sodium, potassium, and magnesium as expected. The vasodilators ketanserin and flosequinan did not affect water and electrolyte excretion. Ketanserin increased urate output in common with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may act as facultative diuretics. Combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (100 mg) or rilmenidine (1 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) had little influence upon the known actions of the diuretic. When the beta-blocker pindolol (10 mg) was given with the diuretic clopamide (5 mg), beneficial effects were noted; potassium and magnesium losses were markedly reduced, whereas the natriuretic and diuretic effects of clopamide were unchanged. These short-term studies in healthy volunteers provide useful pointers to some possible pharmacodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs in patients.\r"

Each fetus was observed for 3 hours; either no stimulus or a 3-second stimulus was delivered after the first hour. Fetal heart rate baseline and variation, breathing movement incidence, rate, and variation, and body movement incidence data were acquired concurrently and analyzed at 15-minute intervals. Intergroup comparisons showed that, after stimulation, fetal heart rate baseline and variation increased significantly, whereas breathing incidence fell during the first 15 minutes. Within-group analyses showed that poststimulus elevation of fetal heart rate baseline was the only significant time interaction over the 3 hours. Vibroacoustic stimulation appears to be primarily associated with transient alterations in fetal heart rate baseline; concomitant changes in breathing activity probably reflect normal biologic cycles.\r"

The mean patient age was 65.3 years; 60% of the patients had stage I disease. Of those patients with clinical stage I disease, more advanced disease was found at celiotomy in 33%. Retroperitoneal nodes were positive for malignancy in 35% of 20 patients who underwent node sampling. Cell washings were positive in 12%, and 9% had omental metastases. Forty-seven percent had homologous tumors; 53% of tumors were heterologous. Relatively poor prognosis was associated with large tumor volume, vascular invasion, nodal metastases, and disease outside the uterus. The overall survival rate was 32%; 14 of 24 patients with stage I disease are dead of disease. Of patients dead of disease, 92.5% had distant metastases. Adjuvant therapy with a combination of VP-16, cisplatin, and irradiation was beneficial in four high-risk patients.\r"

Women were managed with the assistance of ambulatory perinatal nursing to provide outpatient surveillance. Modified bed rest, prophylactic tocolysis, and betamethasone were liberally used and patients were hospitalized only when obstetrically indicated. The most common antepartum complication was preterm labor (66.2%) and the success of therapy with tocolytic agents is described. The mean gestational age and birth weight at delivery were 33.6 +/- 3 weeks (mean +/- SD) and 1871 +/- 555 gm, respectively. Comparison of the gestational age distribution at delivery with previous reviews demonstrates fewer deliveries less than 29 weeks' gestation and significantly more deliveries between 32 and 37 weeks' gestation. Cesarean delivery occurred in 94% of the triplets, which eliminated birth order as a factor that affects survival. The corrected perinatal survival rate was 95% in this contemporary review of outpatient triplet management and represents a major improvement in the expected outcome for triplets.\r"

Although the direct obstetric mortality rate has decreased 95% over the 40 years, within causal mortality groups the rates have changed variably during the past 5 years. For the first time, no deaths from obstetric infection occurred. Whereas deaths from toxemia continue to decline, those from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthetic complications remain unchanged. Within the hemorrhage causal group, deaths from ectopic pregnancy have risen to 70%. The maternal death rate after 20 weeks' gestation is almost 10 times that associated with pregnancy interruptions. Of particular concern is the relative risk of death between the nonwhite and white patients. The North Carolina data are reviewed in the light of those in the South Atlantic region and in the nation as a whole.\r"

The clinical diagnosis of intraamniotic infection was made in 43 (10.5%) patients. Patients with intraamniotic infection were younger, of lower gravidity and parity, more likely to require oxytocin augmentation, and more likely to be monitored internally than were patients who were not infected. They also had longer durations of labor, ruptured membranes, and hospitalization before delivery, had significantly more vaginal examinations, and were more likely to be delivered of infants by cesarean section, as compared with patients without infection. Logistic regression analysis identified four variables independently associated with intraamniotic infection: the number of vaginal examinations, duration of ruptured membranes, use of internal monitors, and duration of total labor. Further study is necessary to clarify the role of these risk factors in the pathogenesis of intraamniotic infection so that infection control strategies can be developed.\r"

The groups were similar in size and in demographic and clinical parameters. Two patients from each group required a third antibiotic, and no patient required rehospitalization. Group III required more days of antibiotic therapy than did group I, 2.9 versus 2.1 days (p less than 0.01), and cost $412.00 more per patient. This data strongly suggest that a short course of antibiotic therapy is efficacious and safe and would result in substantial monetary savings.\r"

Analysis was complete for 208 patients. These patients make up the following cardiac surgical categories: septal defect repairs, 92; commissurotomies, 60; valve replacements, 46; tetralogy of Fallot repairs, 6; and coronary artery bypass procedures, 4. Of 208 patients, 68 (32.7%) attempted pregnancy after surgery. Infertility was defined in five women as follows: endometriosis, 3; ovulatory dysfunction, 1; unknown, 1. A total of 64 patients conceived 121 pregnancies with the following outcomes: live births, 98; spontaneous abortion, 9; ectopic pregnancy, 2; therapeutic abortion, 12. Our results suggest that infertility is not an apparent disorder after cardiac surgery and that subsequent pregnancy outcomes are similar to those in the general population.\r"

Of these, 55 (76.4%) women were followed up for 3 to 41 months (mean, 23.8) to determine subsequent fertility. During the follow-up period, 30 pregnancies occurred among the 55 patients; 24 were intrauterine and 6 were repeat ectopic pregnancies. In the surgical group of 39 patients with salpingectomy, 60.8% of those desiring pregnancy achieved an intrauterine pregnancy. Of the 12 patients with salpingostomy, the three who desired pregnancy achieved it (100%). In the tubal abortion group, the two women desiring pregnancy conceived (100%). There were six repeat ectopic pregnancies (10.9%). Of the ectopic pregnancies, one occurred in the salpingectomy group (2.6%), four in the salpingostomy group (33.3%), and one in the tubal abortion group (25%). Five of the six ectopic gestations were found in the contralateral fallopian tube. Hysterosalpingographic evidence of contralateral tubal patency was a good prognostic indicator for subsequent intrauterine pregnancy. By contrast, one half of study patients with findings suggesting tubal occlusion still achieved an intrauterine pregnancy.\r"

No change in pituitary luteinizing hormone interpulse interval was found in the follicular phase of the cycle, although a faster pulse frequency in the luteal phase was found after clomiphene citrate when compared with placebo. No differences were found in the luteal phase (pulse frequency, amplitude, and mean luteinizing hormone level) after clomiphene citrate versus placebo in the volunteers. These data suggest that the principal mechanism of action of clomiphene citrate is an increase in the concentration of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal circulation, with a resultant increase in pituitary luteinizing hormone secretion.\r"

The umbilical cord arterial and venous pH values (expressed as mean +/- 2 SD) were 7.24 +/- 0.14 (n = 1694) and 7.32 +/- 0.12 (n = 1820), respectively. The incidence of newborn depression (1- or 5-minute Apgar score less than 7) was 14.1%; of these depressed newborns, the incidence of normal umbilical cord arterial pH values (greater than or equal to -2 SD) was 77.8%. Of the vigorous newborns, there was a 2.1% incidence of umbilical cord arterial blood acidemia. Umbilical cord arterial blood acidemia in vigorous newborns was not highly predictive of specific morbidity in the immediate newborn period. Regression analysis demonstrated the umbilical cord arterial pH to correlate best with the Apgar scores when compared with all other arterial or venous blood gas measurements. We reached the following conclusions: (1) that obtaining cord arterial pH values in vigorous newborns should be considered since the values will provide objective documentation or normal fetal acid base balance in 98% of infants. (2) Only a cord arterial pH determination is recommended since it reflects fetal or newborn status more accurately than all other measurements. Additional measurements increase the likelihood of abnormal results and do not contribute to neonatal management. (3) An umbilical cord blood pH value is extremely useful in ruling out the diagnosis of birth asphyxia in the depressed newborn.\r"

A preexisting intrauterine pressure catheter was used for amnioinfusion. The incidence of thick meconium was significantly lower after amnioinfusion, compared with standard management (5% versus 62% p less than 0.0005). This was also demonstrated with spectrophotometry. Significant differences between the amnioinfusion group and the control group were found for the following: arterial cord pH less than 7.20 (16% versus 38%, p less than 0.05); meconium more than trace below the vocal cords at delivery (0% versus 29%, p less than 0.05) and need for positive pressure ventilation at birth (16% versus 48%, p less than 0.05). No complications related to amnioinfusion were observed. We conclude that (1) transcervical amnioinfusion during labor complicated by meconium is a simple and apparently safe procedure, and that (2) amnioinfusion effectively decreases the frequency of thick meconium, the frequency of neonatal acidemia, the frequency of more than trace meconium below the vocal cords, and the need for positive pressure ventilation.\r"

The day before parturition we also measured the pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II and norepinephrine. Systolic blood pressure fell significantly during the last week of gestation in both strains, reaching normotensive levels in the hypertensive rats by term. The pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II, but not norepinephrine, of the pregnant rats was reduced compared with that of the nonpregnant rats in both strains. Oophorectomy did not prevent the fall in blood pressure or the decrease in vascular reactivity to angiotensin II. Therefore, although ovarian relaxin secretion increases during pregnancy, it apparently does not decrease vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II or cause vasodilation.\r"

Moreover, the prevalence of peripartum cocaine abuse increased considerably during the study period. The perinatal outcomes of the 138 patients whose urine samples yielded positive test results for cocaine were compared with those of the 88 control patients with negative results. Cocaine use was associated with lower gestational age at delivery and higher incidences of preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, and small-for-gestational-age infants. When compared with control infants, infants of mothers who used cocaine had more instances of neonatal morbidity and longer hospitalizations. In this study peripartum cocaine abuse was common, increased during the study period, and was associated with perinatal morbidity.\r"

The factor used to convert the whole blood values to plasma glucose values was empirically derived in a population in whom pregnancy status was not stated. A conversion factor derived from a nonpregnant population may systematically overestimate plasma glucose concentration when applied to a pregnant population. Paired specimens obtained from 995 consecutive pregnant patients were analyzed by the Somogyi-Nelson method on whole blood and the glucose oxidase method on plasma. A conversion formula was derived and was used to estimate plasma glucose values and 95% confidence limits equivalent to whole blood values. Application of this formula yields plasma glucose oxidase glucose tolerance test values of fasting, 96 mg/dl; 1 hour, 172 mg/dl; 2 hours, 152 mg/dl, and 3 hours, 131 mg/dl.

Thirty women with gestational diabetes and 80 control volunteers between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation were tested at the same time of day on two successive days. Of the 30 women with diabetes, three (10%) had glucose screening test results below the 135 mg/dl threshold on both days and 10 (33%) had results that straddled the threshold on successive days. Test results of 11 control women also straddled the threshold. Among these 21 women with results that straddled the threshold, there was no difference in mean glucose screening test results in diabetic women compared with nondiabetic ones. We conclude that, as currently recommended, the 1-hour glucose screening test is moderately reproducible.

An overall incidence of 11% small-for-gestational-age and 12% large-for-gestational-age infants was calculated for the control group. A significantly higher incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants (20% vs. 11%, p less than 0.001) was found between the control and the low category. In the high mean blood glucose category an approximate twofold increase was found in the incidence of large-for-gestational-age infants when compared with the control group (p less than 0.03). No significant difference was found between the control and mean blood glucose categories (87 to 104 mg/dl). Our data suggest that a relationship exists between level of glycemic control and neonatal weight. This information is helpful in targeting the level of glycemic control while optimizing pregnancy outcome in gestational diabetes comparable to the general population.\r"

There was no correlation between days in hospital or number of painful crises and either birth weight or birth weight percentile. The number of dense irreversibly sickled and least deformable cells was negatively correlated with birth weight percentile (r = -0.63, p less than 0.01). Patients' initial hemoglobin levels were positively correlated with birth weight percentile (r = 0.52, p less than 0.004). Hemoglobin F, on the other hand, was significantly inversely correlated with birth weight percentile. Nine pregnancies with small-for-gestational-age infants had an average hemoglobin level of 9.1% +/- 4.5%. In contrast, patients who were delivered of appropriate-for-gestational-age infants (23 pregnancies) had an average hemoglobin F level of 3.6% +/- 2.9% (p less than 0.01). We conclude that total hemoglobin levels and dense cells are correlated with birth weight percentile; moreover, the higher the maternal hemoglobin F levels the higher the risk of small-for-gestational-age infants. We speculate that although high hemoglobin levels may be beneficial to the fetus, high maternal hemoglobin F levels could increase the desaturation of non-F cells and induce placental obstruction.\r"

However, little is known regarding the effect of epidural analgesia on the incidence of cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women. During the first 6 months of 1987 we studied 711 consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. Comparison of 447 patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients who received either narcotics or no analgesia was performed. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group (3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p less than 0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race, gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin, duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p greater than 0.20) in both groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood gas parameters between the two groups. This study suggests that epidural analgesia in labor may increase the incidence of cesarean section for dystocia in nulliparous women.\r"

  ".W": "Increase in platelet size has been found in conditions with increased platelet destruction and use. This increase in platelet size can be found in patients with moderate or severe hypertension in pregnancy, even in the presence of a normal platelet count. The goal of this study was to investigate whether an increase in platelet size was present before the manifestation of the disease and therefore could be used to predict the progression of the disease before it is clinically apparent. Three hundred normal primigravid pregnancies were studied between 28 and 30 weeks' gestation, and blood was taken to assess platelet count and mean platelet volume. Two hundred sixteen patients had no hypertensive problems during their pregnancy, 84 developed hypertension, 62 had mild hypertension only with diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 99 mm Hg, 13 had moderate hypertension with diastolic blood pressures between 100 and 109, and nine had severe hypertension with diastolic blood pressure above 110. No difference was found between these groups in the parameters measured. Therefore it was felt that platelet volume may not be a useful screening test in a low-risk population. A second study was carried out to investigate the serial changes in these parameters in patients at risk of progressive disease. Thirty-four patients with essential hypertension were followed from 24 weeks with serial blood sampling to study changes in platelet size. An additional 40 patients with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension were also studied. From these patient groups, 20 patients developed severe hypertension. The mean platelet volume increased significantly at least 1 week before the hypertension became clinically apparent. There was no change in platelet count at this time. It is concluded that increasing platelet size can predict which patients are likely to progress to severe disease before it becomes clinically obvious.\r"

However, the most recent thoracic electrical bioimpedance technology has not been validated in pregnancy. We therefore compared two methods of measuring cardiac output in pregnancy, thoracic electrical bioimpedance and thermodilution. We studied 11 patients who required pulmonary artery catheterization for peripartum management and measured cardiac output simultaneously by thoracic electrical bioimpedance and thermodilution. Among eight of nine patients, there was agreement (within +/- 20%) between the two methods. Bivariate linear regression with these nine cases showed excellent correlation (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) with a slope of 1.04, which indicated a one-to-one relationship between thoracic electrical bioimpedance and thermodilution. The remaining two cases were removed from analysis because of septic shock in one case (which invalidates thoracic electrical bioimpedance) and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation in another case (which invalidates thermodilution). These data support that thoracic electrical bioimpedance measurement of cardiac output may be valid in most peripartum patients.\r"

All results have been confirmed by karyotyping. Dot blots have given false-positive \"male\" results three times. In contrast, the polymerase chain reaction has correctly determined fetal sex in every case, even when the dot blot was in error. The Y-specific polymerase chain reaction has been applied to fetal deoxyribonucleic DNA with a chromosome 15; Y translocation to identify the origin of the translocated material. Thus the polymerase chain reaction appears to be a reliable method to rapidly determine fetal sex that also can be used diagnostically to identify translocated Y-chromosomal material.\r"

Changes in fetal mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure levels at 2 and 30 minutes after bolus injection of 50 micrograms were minimal; by 60 minutes these values had returned to preinfusion levels. No significant changes were observed after infusion of 100 micrograms of nicardipine. Fetal heart rate, fetal arterial blood gas values, and maternal cardiovascular variables did not change at either dose. Fetal plasma concentrations of nicardipine were 78 +/- 28 ng/ml and 114 +/- 48 ng/ml at 30 minutes after infusion of 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms, respectively, well within the range previously reported to be associated with fetal asphyxia. These data suggest that the previously reported fetal acidosis from maternal infusion of nicardipine may be primarily due to a decrease in maternal uterine blood flow rather than a direct fetal effect of the drug.\r"

Fetal hypoxemia was produced by mechanically restricting uterine blood flow with a vascular clamp placed around the maternal common internal iliac artery. Fetal arterial oxygen tension decreased from 22.3 +/- 1.8 to 17.8 +/- 1.5 mm Hg at 2 hours and remained low for the 24-hour experimental period. Fetal pH decreased from 7.34 +/- 0.01 to 7.20 +/- 0.05 at 2 hours and returned to normal values by 12 hours. No significant change was observed in the number or characteristics of fetal heart rate accelerations or decelerations during the 24-hour control period. There was a significant increase in the number of accelerations from 48 +/- 4 to 63 +/- 4 per hour at 8 hours of hypoxemia followed by a return to control values by 12 hours. There was no significant change in the mean amplitude or duration of accelerations. There was a significant increase in the number of decelerations per hour with an associated increase in the mean amplitude but a decrease in the mean duration of decelerations during the first 16 hours of hypoxemia. We conclude that prolonged hypoxemia in fetal sheep leads to an initial increase in the number of both accelerations and decelerations in fetal heart rate followed by a return to normal patterns indistinguishable from those of the normoexemic fetus.\r"

Experimental fetal hyperinsulinemia has previously been associated with increased fat accumulation in rhesus monkey fetuses and increased lipid content and lipogenesis in rat fetuses. We hypothesized that prolonged fetal hyperinsulinemia would alter plasma total fatty acids and the individual fatty acids in each major lipid group. Fatty acids determined by gas-liquid chromatography were measured in the arterial blood of 12 chronically catheterized fetal sheep after 10 to 12 days of insulin (n = 7) or placebo (n = 5) infusion. Plasma concentrations of insulin were 412 +/- 63 microU/ml and 9 +/- 3 microU/ml (mean +/- SE) in the insulin- and placebo-treated fetal sheep, respectively. Prolonged fetal hyperinsulinemia was associated with lower circulating total fatty acid levels in each lipid class except cholesterol esters. Although the precursor of arachidonic acid, 18:2 (linoleic acid), was not decreased in any lipid class, insulin infusion was associated with reduced arachidonic acid in each lipid class. We conclude that prolonged fetal hyperinsulinemia decreases circulating total fatty acid and the individual fatty acids in each of the major lipid classes, except for the cholesterol esters. We speculate that these reductions in circulating fatty acids represent an insulin-mediated increase in tissue deposition.\r"

This is done with the intention of stopping uterine activity in patients with false preterm labor. A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydration on preterm uterine contractions in patients without proved preterm labor. A total of 28 patients were treated with bed rest and an intravenous bolus and subsequent continuous infusion of 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution. A control group of 20 patients were treated with bed rest alone. Uterine activity and arrest of uterine contractions were compared between the two groups. Contractions stopped in 54% of the patients treated with hydration, whereas contractions stopped in 40% of the patients in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant. As a crossover study, those in the control group with contractions that continued after the initial observation period were subsequently treated with intravenous fluids. Only one patient in this group stopped contracting. Of all patients whose contractions with either therapy, 18% eventually were delivered of preterm infants. This included 20% of the hydration group and 14% of the control group. The use of hydration as a pretherapy indicator to differentiate true preterm labor from false preterm labor could not be supported by this study. In addition, patients whose contractions stopped with either hydration or bed rest are at increased risk of subsequent preterm delivery.\r"

This prospective, randomized study compares cardiovascular and metabolic effects measured in association with sublingual and oral administration of nifedipine with those noted with the intravenous and oral administration of the beta-adrenergic agent ritodrine. Serial measurements of cardiovascular parameters, hematocrit, electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase were compared between groups. Sublingual and oral nifedipine caused minimal cardiovascular alterations. At doses sufficient to achieve tocolysis, ritodrine caused more pronounced cardiovascular changes than nifedipine. Both agents had a hemodilutional effect, but nifedipine was not associated with alterations in serum electrolytes or a dramatic hyperglycemia. On the basis of this study, it appears that the use of nifedipine for preterm labor management is associated with hemodilutional changes but not the adverse cardiovascular or metabolic effects often associated with ritodrine tocolysis.\r"

Among infants of similar ages, however, there was no variation in serum prolactin level as a function of birth weight, sex, Apgar scores, or delivery method. Infants of women with pregnancy-induced hypertension had higher than normal prolactin levels; infants of diabetic women had normal prolactin levels. At 31.5 to 37 weeks' gestation, infants who developed respiratory distress syndrome had lower serum prolactin levels than those whose lung function was normal or else was abnormal from causes other respiratory distress syndrome. The risk for respiratory distress syndrome was higher in newborns whose prolactin level was low (10th percentile) than in infants whose prolactin level was high (90th percentile). These results are suggestive that prolactin may play a role in fetal lung maturation.\r"

Leukoattractants were detected in 13 cases (87%) and absent in 2 cases (13%) with histologic chorioamnionitis (p less than 0.005). The two cases with histologic chorioamnionitis that had negative leukotaxis were classified as stage l/mild severity. A positive leukotactic response was a better predictor of histologic chorioamnionitis (87%) than positive Gram stain (33%), amniotic fluid culture (53%), gas-liquid chromatography (40%), or a combination of these three methods (60%). These results suggest that demonstration of leukoattractants in amniotic fluid is an earlier and more sensitive predictor of chorioamnionitis than is presently available.\r"

Patients who came to the hospital in preterm labor with intact membranes between 20 and 35 weeks' gestation underwent transabdominal amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid was sent for Gram stain and culture. Patients received tocolytic therapy as clinically indicated. Of 127 patients cultured, seven (5.5%) had positive amniotic fluid cultures. These patients had a significantly decreased latency period from amniocentesis to delivery (4.4 days versus 28.6 days), and a significantly increased chance of being delivered of preterm infants (100% versus 52.5%), as compared with patients with negative cultures. The rate of positive Gram stain was 7 of 125 positive. However, there was no correlation between positive Gram stain and positive culture results. Similarly, positive Gram stain results were not associated with any difference in the latency period or rate of preterm delivery.\r"

Our goal was to more precisely define birth asphyxia based on fetal condition as measured by umbilical artery blood pH, Apgar scores, and neurologic condition of newborns. We selected for study 2738 patients with singleton pregnancies with cephalic presentations who were delivered of infants at term to avoid complications such as prematurity, which may affect infant outcome independent of birth condition. The basis for study of these particular patients were defined criteria for high risk and an indicated arterial cord pH value. A total of five infants demonstrated cerebral dysfunction as evidenced by seizures during the neonatal period. Infection was linked to seizures in three of these infants; one infant had neonatal asphyxia and only one infant's clinical course could be attributed solely to birth events (uterine rupture). Stratification of umbilical artery blood pH values, Apgar scores, and combinations of these dependent variables in relation to newborn clinical outcomes revealed that infants must be severely depressed at delivery before birth asphyxia can be reliably diagnosed. Such depression includes Apgar scores less than or equal to 3 at 1 and 5 minutes plus umbilical artery pH values less than 7.00.\r"

In vivo studies suggest a role for platelets and monocytes-macrophages in mediating glomerular hypercellularity. The authors recently reported that several peptide growth factors stimulate DNA synthesis and growth of human mesangial cells. This article reports that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a peptide released by inflammatory cells and platelets, inhibits DNA synthesis and growth of human mesangial cells. The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of these mitogens on DNA synthesis and growth was confirmed by autoradiography and cell counting. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta is not mediated at the receptor level because TGF-beta did not inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to mesangial cells. Because peptide growth factors that stimulate DNA synthesis in mesangial cells induce expression of PDGF mRNAs, the effect of TGF-beta on PDGF mRNAs expression induced by peptide growth factors was studied. TGF-beta did not lower the increased levels of PDGF mRNAs caused by EGF or PDGF. These data show that TGF-beta is a potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis and growth of mesangial cells. The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "MRL/Mp mice bearing the lymphoproliferation gene (lpr) spontaneously develop systemic granulomatous arteritis coincident with glomerulonephritis (GNP). Although the association of lpr-dependent lymphoproliferation in these mice seems to be a prerequisite for the development of granulomatous arteritis, the genetic basis is poorly understood. The first approach to this problem was to study the ability of another, nonallelic, lymphoproliferative gene, gld (generalized lymphoproliferative disease), inducing arteritis in MRL/Mp mice. The gld gene was placed on an MRL/Mp background by producing reciprocal (MRL/Mp-+/+ X C3H/Hej-gld/gld)F2 hybrid mice. Seventeen percent of these mice with lymphoproliferation had arteritis and GNP, suggesting that more than one lymphoproliferative gene could induce GNP and arteritis in an MRL/Mp background. Next, the effect of rearrangements in the genetic background of MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice by hybridization with non-autoimmune lpr-bearing mice was examined. This was done by making MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr X reciprocal (MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr X C57BL/6-lpr/lpr)F1 mice. Thirty-three percent of these mice developed arteritis, but one third of these did not get GNP, thus showing that susceptibility to arteritis was separate from GNP. The histopathologic features of the arteritis in both the F2 hybrids and the backcross mice were granulomatous and were identical to those seen in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice. These findings suggested that it might be possible to dissociated two components (arteritis and GNP) of a severe autoimmune disease of MRL/Mp mice and to study their pathogenesis separately.\r"

The cases were grouped according to localization; gastric, intestinal, and mesenteric lymphoma. All cases were reviewed histologically, graded according to the Working Formulation, and reclassified according to the Kiel classification, which was modified to include the categories low- and high-grade mucosa-associated lymphoma. Clinical data, as well as staging and follow-up data, were related to both the original diagnosis and the diagnosis after reclassification. The results showed that the distribution of the types of lymphoma is related to site: centroblastic lymphoma was predominant in the stomach, lymphoblastic in the bowel, and follicular centroblastic-centrocytic in the mesentery. Gastrointestinal lymphoma was disseminated in approximately 50% of the patients at presentation. Survival analysis revealed that classification according to the original Kiel classification and grading according to the Working Formulation provided important prognostic information, whereas introduction of mucosa-associated lymphoma as an entity did not. It was concluded that modification of current classifications to include a separate category for mucosa-associated lymphoma is not useful.\r"

In (B6Xbm12)F1 recipient mice, bile duct changes resembling chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC) and a formation of epithelioid granulomas were observed during the course of GVHR. An epithelioid granuloma in the liver of (B6Xbm1)F1 or (bm1.Xbm12)F1 recipients was not detected. By electron microscopy, the bile duct epithelia were seen to be in close contact with infiltrating cells, and marked alterations of their cytoplasm and microvilli were demonstrated; ie, vacuolation of the cytoplasm, deterioration of microvilli, and bleb formation were frequently observed in the liver of class II-disparate hosts. Concerning the basement membrane, no marked changes characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), such as many-layered basement membranes containing osmium positive substance, were detected. Because the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-disparate system was used in our experimental system in the GVHR, the antigen expressed on the bile duct might be a target and be associated with the formation of the initial hepatic lesions in PBC such as CNSDC and epithelioid granuloma formation. Thus, GVHR across the MHC class II antigen is believed to play an important role in the development of PBC.\r"

Immunostained cryosections of adenomatous and hyperplastic parathyroid glands from 30 hypercalcemic patients with primary or uremic hyperparathroidism (HPT) showed a reduced and heterogeneous staining with the antibodies. This contrasted with the intense and even staining of normal and suppressed human parathyroid glands, as well as lymph node metastases of parathyroid carcinoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsies and imprints of the parathyroid glands showed a conspicuous antibody staining that enabled the identification of parathyroid cells. The antibodies seem to provide new means for histologic and cytologic identification of normal and pathologic parathyroid tissue, in conjunction with their highly restricted tissue reactivity. Because one of the antibodies interacts with a surface receptor mechanism of the parathyroid cells that is involved in the sensing and gating of calcium and, thereby, also with the regulation of parathyroid hormone release, the unequivocal demonstration of reduced staining of the adenomatous and hyperplastic parathyroid tissue suggests that HPT is associated with reduced expression of the calcium sensoring mechanism of the pathologic parathyroid tissue.\r"

Immunocytochemistry was used to localize VIP in human biopsied pituitary adenomas and postmortem anterior pituitary glands. Paraffin sections were immunostained for VIP with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Strong VIP-like immunoreactivity (VIP-LI) was observed in 16 of 17 prolactinomas, 12 of 14 growth hormone-secreting tumors associated with acromegaly, four of 12 ACTH-secreting tumors, and 14 of 18 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. In most cases, VIP was colocalized with the classical pituitary hormones. Six of the 18 nonfunctioning tumors had no demonstrable hormone immunoreactivity; five of these stained strongly for VIP, whereas one was negative. Of 18 normal anterior pituitaries, 12 showed strong diffuse staining for VIP throughout the gland. One pituitary with VIP-LI came from an individual who had undergone pituitary stalk transection. Double-immunoenzyme labeling and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated VIP-LI in many lactotrophs, scattered thyrotrophs, corticotrophs, and in an occasional gonadotroph. These results suggest the following: 1) VIP is present in more than one cell type in normal and adenomatous human pituitaries; and 2) VIP may be involved in the function and development of pituitary tumors.\r"

  ".U": "89390540\r", 
  ".W": "Fenoldopam mesylate (FM), a selective, postjunctional, dopaminergic (DA1) vasodilator, causes a novel lesion of large caliber splanchnic arteries (100 to 800 microns) in the rat characterized by necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells and hemorrhage. FM does not induce lesions in other vascular beds of the rat or in dogs or monkeys. Dopamine, like FM, causes hemorrhagic lesions of large caliber splanchnic arteries in the rat, as well as fibrinoid necrosis of small caliber arteries (less than 100 microns) of the splanchnic, cerebral, coronary, and renal vascular beds. Dopamine, an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor and dopaminergic agonist, is used clinically, principally as a pressor agent. Because these arterial lesions were believed to result from the pharmacologic activity of these two compounds, the role of vascular receptor subtypes in their pathogenesis was investigated. Rats were coexposed to either FM or dopamine and a variety of receptor antagonists (alpha, beta, DA1, DA2, and 5HT2). In rats coexposed to the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) and either FM or dopamine, the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic lesions of large caliber arteries were increased; PBZ, however, prevented the formation of dopamine-induced fibrinoid lesions in arteries of small caliber. SK&F 83566-C, a selective DA1 dopaminergic receptor antagonist, prevented the induction of FM and dopamine-induced hemorrhagic lesions of large caliber arteries. Rats exposed concurrently to dopamine, phenoxybenzamine, and SK&F 83566-C were free of all arterial lesions. The other receptor antagonists tested did not prevent arterial injury. Thus, the induction of splanchnic arterial lesions in the rat by dopamine and FM is caused by stimulation of, and interaction between, alpha-adrenoceptors and dopaminergic DA1 receptors. Activation of the postjunctional, dopaminergic (DA1) receptor is causally associated with the induction of novel hemorrhagic lesions of large caliber splanchnic arteries in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "Skin biopsies were collected from 15 patients with cutaneous tumors morphologically similar to Ki-1+ anaplastic large cell (ALC) lymphoma of the lymph nodes, including Ki-1+ ALC lymphoma of childhood. The histology and immunophenotype of these cutaneous tumors are reported and follow-up data on the patients are given. The tumorous infiltrates were composed of large, sometimes very bizarre cells with one nucleolus or multiple nucleoli. All tumor cells expressed the lymphoid cell activation antigen Ki-1 (CD30) in conjunction with CD25 and the beta-chain of the T cell receptor. In 11 patients, Ki-1+ cutaneous tumors developed primarily in the skin. In nine patients, these were restricted to the skin in follow-up periods ranging from 3 months to 6 years. Two patients developed lymph node involvement after 2 months and 2 years, indicating the spreading potential of these cutaneous tumors. Morphologic and immunophenotypical identity of the atypical cells found in primary cutaneous ALC lymphoma, in regressing atypical histiocytosis (RAH), and in lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) of type A, together with the protracted clinical course in all three conditions, suggests that primary cutaneous ALC lymphoma, RAH, and LyP of type A represent clinical variants of the same lymphoma entity. Secondary development of Ki-1+ ALC skin tumors was observed in two patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas of mycosis fungoides type. These secondary Ki-1+ ALC lymphomas of the skin showed rapid systemic progression similar to the primary lymphonodal Ki-1+ ALC lymphomas. Concomitant or subsequent occurrence of Ki-1+ ALC tumors in cutaneous T cell lymphomas thus may be a bad prognostic sign.\r"

  ".W": "Age-related changes of the condyle of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in strains of Senescence Accelerated Mouse (SAM) were investigated. With advancing age, all strains of SAM showed degenerative joint disease initiated by degenerative changes such as eg, roughness, fissure, and erosion on the condylar surface. These degenerative changes were in concert with an active remodeling that can lead to deformation of the condyle. Moreover, the short-lived SAM-P (accelerated senescence prone mouse) strains developed these degenerative changes earlier than did the SAM-R (accelerated senescence resistant mouse) strains. Thus, development of degenerative joint disease in SAM was closely related not only to chronological age but also to the accelerated senescence phenomenon. Of the SAM-P series, the SAM-P/3 strain was the first to manifest degenerative changes (approximately 50% at 7 to 9 months of age and 100% over 12 months of age) and thereafter showed the highest incidence of severe changes with overt deformity. As a model of degenerative joint disease, this strain of SAM should prove useful.\r"

  ".U": "89390545\r", 
  ".W": "Alveolar fibrin deposition commonly accompanies acute lung injury, but the nature of the local abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis that support pathologic fibrin deposition are not well understood. The trended abnormalities of procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities occurring in lung lavage fluids of Fischer 344 rats after lung injury induced by intravenous oleic acid (OA) or intratracheal bleomycin were studied. After injury by either agent, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) contained increased procoagulant activity and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Lavage procoagulant activity was mainly due to an activator of Factor X attributable to the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and fibrinolytic activity was almost completely plasminogen dependent. Major mechanisms of inhibition of fibrinolytic activity involved both the inhibition of the plasminogen activator (PA) and plasmin. These abnormalities were temporally associated with prominent alveolar fibrin deposition in both models. In OA-treated animals, lavage fibrinolytic activity was absent or profoundly decreased, and antiplasmin and procoagulant activities were increased within 4 hours after the induction of acute lung injury. By 24 hours after OA, lavage PA inhibitor (PAI) activity was elevated with sustained antiplasmin activity. By 3 days after OA, these abnormalities had resolved in association with almost complete resolution of alveolar fibrin deposits. Within 3 days after bleomycin-induced lung injury, lavage procoagulant activity was increased and fibrinolytic activity was depressed due to increased antiplasmin and PAI activities. These conditions persisted for 2 weeks, during which time alveolar fibrin deposition was associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. These data indicate that a disruption of the normal balance between procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities occurs in alveolar lining fluids of rats with alveolitis induced by either OA or bleomycin, and that concurrent abnormalities of pathways of fibrin turnover that occur in alveolar lining fluids promote the alveolar fibrin deposition associated with these lung injuries.\r"

Both the islet cell adenomas and the hepatocellular carcinomas developed from the proliferation of T antigen-positive cells. However, T antigen expression was not seen in either the peripheral or central nervous systems. Stimulation of the metallothionein promoter with heavy metals altered the temporal onset of hepatic expression and broadened the distribution of oncogene expression to include exocrine pancreas and renal tubular epithelium. Although solid tumors were not seen in the exocrine pancreas or kidneys of SV-202 mice, all immunopositive tissues developed histologic changes. These results indicate that metallothionein-directed T antigen expression can induce abnormal cellular growth in a variety of tissues, and the distribution of these tissues can be manipulated with heavy metals.\r"

After casein injection, interstitial cells of testes, cells of adrenal cortex, kidney proximal convoluted tubule epithelia, and some parafollicular cells of spleen took up SAA in a time pattern related to plasma SAA levels. Extrahepatic SAA1 and SAA2 mRNA were induced by lipopolysaccharide in kidney proximal and distal convoluted tubule epithelia, and SAA1 mRNA was induced in epithelial lining the mucosa of the ileum and large intestine, indicating that there may be more than one function for the apoSAA gene family related to site of and stimulus for expression.\r"

  ".W": "Purified radiolabeled fibrinogen and antithrombin III (ATIII) were injected intravenously into rabbits before a deendothelializing injury to the aorta, and allowed to circulate for 0.1 to 6 hours before exsanguination, excision of the aorta, and quantification of each protein/unit area of subendothelium (intima-media). Uptake of fibrinogen was rapid (saturation 10 minutes after injury was approximately 13.0 pmol/cm2) compared with that of ATIII (45 to 60 minutes; 3.5 to 4.3 pmol/cm2). Both proteins associated primarily (greater than 90%) with the subendothelium rather than the platelet monolayer. The avidity of the deendothelialized vessel of these proteins was measured after a 20-minute circulation time at various intervals after injury. Whereas turnover of fibrinogen was fairly constant (approximately 100% per hour), that of ATIII was maximal (approximately 200% per hour) at 1 hour, decreasing to approximately 105% per hour at 5 hours after injury. The profile of ATIII turnover mirrored that of thrombin released in vitro from the deendothelialized aorta up to 10 days after injury, whereas the uninjured aorta and the aorta deendothelialized ex vivo adsorbed fibrinogen poorly and released negligible thrombin. Pretreatment of the aorta, deendothelialized ex vivo with thrombin in vitro increased fibrinogen uptake significantly. It is possible that, after deendothelialization in vivo, fibrinogen adsorption is determined largely by thrombin generation at the vessel wall. ATIII binding is limited by the availability of binding sites in the subendothelium, although the rate of thrombin generation influences ATIII turnover.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicated that administration of a monoclonal antibody (MoAb 60.3), which blocks neutrophil adherence to rabbit endothelial cells, prevents ischemic-reperfusion (I-R) injury in multiple extrarenal organs. These findings indicated that the neutrophil can be a critical mediator of I-R tissue damage. To assess whether the neutrophil affects renal I-R injury, MoAb 60.3 was given to rabbits that were then subjected to either 50 minutes or 38 minutes of renal ischemia induced by renal artery occlusion (RAO). The severity of kidney damage was assessed 24 and 48 hours later by blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine concentrations and by renal histology. The results were compared with those obtained in time-matched RAO controls. MoAb 60.3 conferred no functional or morphologic protection against either severe or mild ischemic insults. To further evaluate whether neutrophils affect renal I-R injury, rats were depleted of neutrophils (less than 200 cells/mm3) by anti-neutrophil serum administration and then they were subjected to either 37 minutes or 29 minutes of RAO. Neutrophil depletion conferred neither functional nor morphologic protection when compared with time-matched RAO controls. It was concluded that the uniform lack of protection noted in these experiments, despite that two different animals, two different ways of interfering with neutrophil function, and differing severities of ischemic injury were studied, strongly suggests that the neutrophil is not a critical participant in the renal I-R injury process.\r"

AMs isolated from rats with bleomycin-induced fibrosis secreted significantly greater amounts of monocyte chemoattractants than those isolated from normal rats. When AMs from normal rats were stimulated with bleomycin in vitro, monocyte chemotactic activity was secreted into the medium. Chemotactic activity secretion by AM stimulated with 0.01 to 0.1 micrograms/ml bleomycin was significantly higher than that of cells incubated in medium alone. This activity was truly chemotactic for monocytes, but caused only minimal migration of normal AMs. Bleomycin itself at concentrations of 1 pg/ml to 10 micrograms/ml had no monocyte chemoattractant activity. Characterization of the chemotactic activity in conditioned media (CM) from bleomycin-stimulated AM demonstrated that the major portion of the activity bound to gelatin, was heterogeneous, with estimated molecular weights of 20 to 60 kd, and was inactivated by specific antifibronectin antibody. These findings suggest that fibronectin fragments are primarily responsible for the monocyte chemotactic activity secreted by AMs. Through increased secretion of such chemotactic substances, AMs could play a key role in the recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes into the lung in inflammatory lung disease and fibrosis.\r"

This suggests that schizotypal but not borderline personality disorder belongs in the schizophrenic spectrum.

They present differences in the purposes and formatting of these two documents and discuss different levels of compatibility between the two. They demonstrate several problems at the code, rubric, and case levels of compatibility. Ninety-seven percent of DSM-III-R codes are compatible with ICD-9-CM at the case level. The problems in most cases are minor, and in the authors' opinion are not problems in actual clinical or medical records use. The development of DSM-IV and ICD-10 should include attention to translation issues early in the process from the perspectives of clinical work, research, and medical records.\r"

The performance of the male schizophrenic patients was significantly lower than that of the female patients and the male and female normal control subjects. The last three subgroups performed at equivalent levels. These findings are discussed with respect to other reported sex differences in schizophrenia, including frequency of specific neurological signs and structural brain abnormalities, response to neuroleptic medication, and long-term outcome. The findings suggest that the sex of the patient may be a critical variable in understanding the processes of schizophrenia.\r"

Recommendations are also made concerning changes in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's Special Requirements for Residency Training in Psychiatry, which would require residency programs to place more emphasis on training to meet the needs of the chronically mentally ill. Obstacles to the implementation of the proposed recommendations are presented and possible solutions are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the impact of the AIDS epidemic on morbidity and mortality in a defined population of intravenous drug users, we analyzed overall and cause-specific death rates, AIDS incidence, and acute medical hospitalizations among patients in a long-term methadone maintenance program in New York City for the years 1984 through 1987 (midyear population for each year 828 to 891; demographic characteristics did not differ). The number of deaths while in treatment increased from 11 (13.3/1000) in 1984 to 39 (44.2/1000) in 1987. Deaths from AIDS increased from 3.6/1000 to 14.7/1000, deaths due to bacterial pneumonia/sepsis from 3.6/1000 to 13.6/1000; deaths from cirrhosis, drug overdose, trauma, and other causes remained relatively stable. AIDS incidence rose from six cases/1000 in 1984 to 20.4.1000 in 1987. Hospitalizations for AIDS, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and endocarditis/sepsis increased from 84.9/1000 in 1986 to 144.8/1000 in 1987. These data suggest that the AIDS epidemic has had a profound effect on patterns of morbidity and mortality among intravenous drug users in this methadone program population. Drug treatment programs may be important sites for targeting clinical services for drug users with AIDS, although the increasing burden of AIDS-related disease will require expansion of existing funding and treatment resources.\r"

A significantly higher percentage of alcoholic women (40.0% vs 8.8%) reported having made suicide attempts, a difference of 31.2 percentage points (95% CI = 23.9, 38.5). Age comparisons within the alcoholic sample show the percentage of younger alcoholic women attempting suicide to be twice as great as the percentage of the alcoholic women suicide attempters in their forties. Such age differences were not found among the nonalcoholic control group. The findings suggest that youthfulness and alcohol/drug abuse are the critical combination for high risk. Awareness of the suicide attempt risk potential is necessary both for emergency room personnel and for substance abuse facility workers.\r"

Factors contributing to this reduction were examined using interrupted time series analysis of monthly rates of motor vehicle deaths and fatal crashes for the period January 1980 to December 1986. Decreasing per capita alcohol consumption and increased unemployment apparently account for most of the fatality and fatal crash reduction in Oklahoma. The enactment of two traffic safety laws--one specifying the illegal blood alcohol concentration level (BAC law) and the other facilitating license withdrawal from suspected drunk drivers (administrative per se law)--together reduced Oklahoma traffic deaths and fatal crashes by about 9 percent. The effectiveness of the laws appeared to be greatest in the first two years following their enactment.\r"

In 1979, 22 schools were randomly assigned to program or control conditions. Students in program schools received a social influences curriculum in six core and two maintenance sessions in grade 6, two booster sessions in grade 7, and one booster session in grade 8. All students were assessed at pretest (T1), immediate posttest (T2), end of grade 6 (T3), beginning and end of grade 7 (T4 and T5), end of grade 8 (T6), and grades 11 and 12 (T7 and T8). Ninety percent of study students were relocated and data obtained from over 80 percent of them at T8. Program effects on experimental smoking observed in grades 7 and 8 had completely decayed by T8, six years after the beginning of the program. Grade 6 smoking experience and social risk were each strong predictors of T8 smoking behavior. Subjects who had left school were smoking at more than twice the rate of subjects still in high school (grade 12) at T8. We discuss implications of the results.\r"

At a random half of the worksites, we also provided training to discussion leaders who subsequently led discussions among smokers attempting to quit with the program. At health maintenance organization sites we invited smokers who had requested program materials to participate in similar group discussions at health centers. In this paper we report one year follow-up results for the above four groups and compare them with previously reported results of a self-help manual alone. Results for the television plus manual condition were better than those of past studies (25 percent nonsmoking prevalence and 10 percent continuous cessation one year after the program) and considerably better than the manual alone. None of the other conditions designed to supplement the manual plus television produced better long-term outcomes; we explore the reasons for this. The program did encourage and help over 50,000 Chicago smokers to attempt quitting with the American Lung Association manual, 100 times as many as would have done so without the televised program. At least 15 other similar programs implemented since 1984 multiply this effect.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke--passive smoking--results in greater risk of cancer was assessed by measuring the levels of two known carcinogens in the blood of 57 nonsmokers with varying degrees of involuntary exposure, including six heavily exposed bartenders. The concentrations of hemoglobin adducts of 4-aminobiphenyl, a bladder carcinogen, were significantly higher in subjects with confirmed involuntary exposure (plasma cotinine concentrations between 2 and 23 ng/ml) compared with subjects with undetectable levels of cotinine. Similarly, adducts of 3-aminobiphenyl were significantly elevated in subjects with confirmed exposure. The odds of 3-aminobiphenyl adduct levels exceeding 2 pg/g of hemoglobin were 6:7 among the confirmed exposed, compared with the odds of 2:42 among subjects with undetectable cotinine (odds ratio = 18; 95 percent confidence interval = 3.3, 94). The validity of the assay was demonstrated by showing striking declines in adduct levels among quitting smokers.\r"

Blood lead levels averaged 2.14 mumol/L and 0.35 mumol/L in the two groups; the lead workers also showed high levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin, as compared to the controls. Otherwise, the hematological parameters indicated an appropriate iron status and no other deviations. From all subjects, 0.45 L of blood was bled as part of a normal blood donation. Five and 11 days later, reticulocyte counts were significantly higher in the control group than in the lead-exposed workers. On day 15, the lead workers showed a significant delay in blood regeneration, as evidenced by lower hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts. The lead exposure in the present study was within legal limits, and lead-induced anemia would be expected only at much higher exposure levels. Thus, despite the normal hematological findings in the initial examination, the lead exposure caused a decreased reserve capacity for blood formation, and this effect became evident only after the blood loss.\r"

The analysis examined costs instead of charges, included professional costs in addition to hospital costs, and considered the effect of combining tests that are ordered as a panel (e.g., cardiac enzymes) or as part of a procedure (e.g., bronchoscopy). High-cost tests (costing more than $100) accounted for only 4 percent of the total number of tests ordered, but for nearly 50 percent of total test costs. The pattern varied by clinical service: high-cost tests accounted for 31, 47, and 51 percents of total test costs on the obstetrics, medicine, and surgery services, respectively. It would seem to be efficient to concentrate on the use of high-cost tests in attempting to foster cost-effective use of diagnostic technologies.\r"

Motor vehicle crashes are the predominant cause of YLL, and the United States manifests the highest YLL rates for each sex. US fall death rates at the older ages are exceeded by those of France and West Germany. The elderly generally manifest the greatest risk of suicide; American females exhibit a unique rate decline after ages 45-54 years, however. Beyond early adulthood, US suicide rates are lower than those of France, Japan, and West Germany. US homicide rates dwarf those of the comparison countries with 16- to 29-fold differentials separating prime-risk American males aged 25-34 years from their foreign counterparts.\r"

Nine of the patients in this series sustained their injury while performing the bench press. The majority of the remaining patients were also involved in sports when injury occurred. Eleven of the ruptures were in the nondominant arm and eight in the dominant arm. All of the patients complained of weakness, pain, and deformity, with weakness being the major complaint. Following surgery and rehabilitation, all 16 patients who underwent repair were relieved of pain. The deformity was corrected in all 16 patients, although 2 patients who had a 5 year interval from repair to rupture did not achieve a completely normal contour. Thirteen of the 16 patients reported a full return to strength. The others had significant improvements. Ruptures of the pectoralis major muscle are uncommon, but not rare. Ruptures occurring under tension tear at or near the insertion onto the humerus, as in all 19 cases in this series. Distal ruptures are usually complete, despite physical signs that may be misleading. Distal tears are reparable, even after a delay to treatment. After surgical repair, the majority of patients may expect relief of pain, return of strength and normal contour, and maintenance of range of motion.\r"

Histological studies revealed relatively few fibroblasts capable of producing collagen inside the alloplastic ligament. When these results are considered in conjunction with those of our earlier report of the disappointing mechanical strength of the carbon fiber substitutes, it seems evident that carbon fiber is not a suitable replacement for the ACL, mainly because of its failure to produce a \"neoligament\" before it disintegrates.\r"

The pivot shift was accentuated by external femoral torque, decreased by internal femoral torque, and was present in the absence of any applied torque. The pivot shift produced a sudden directional change in the motion of both femoral condyles and may be responsible for the meniscal degeneration that accompanies chronic ACL deficiency.\r"

Lactate produced during a maximal effort requires time to metabolize to a base level. If this does not occur, performance in a repeat effort may be impaired. Thus, techniques to enhance lactate clearance are of potential benefit to the athlete. We have demonstrated previously that swimming at 65% of maximum velocity significantly improved lactate clearance over passive resting. This study tested the effect of various swimming velocities on lactate clearance. Following a maximal swim, blood lactate clearance was tracked during a 15 minute cool down swim. Velocities of 55%, 65%, and 75% of maximum were tested. The results confirmed that cool down swimming will return lactate values to near resting levels in the test interval. However, statistical superiority of any of the test velocities was not demonstrated. The intensity of the swim should be below the lactate accumulation level. The 65% of maximum velocity was felt by all swimmers to be most comfortable and is a good target velocity for the athlete to reference.\r"

This study prospectively examines the incidence, severity, and cause of injuries sustained by a group of elite pair skaters and ice dancers. Thirty-three serious injuries, causing the skater to alter training significantly or to cease training completely for at least 7 consecutive days, were recorded over a 9 month period. Female senior pair skaters reported an average of 1.4 serious injuries, and other groups averaged greater than 0.5 serious injury per skater. The lower extremities were injured most frequently, and 7 of the 33 serious injuries were directly related to the skating boot. Eleven serious injuries were caused by lifts. Few of the serious injuries appeared preventable. Changes in boot design and the training for lifting maneuvers should be initiated and studied prospectively to attempt to reduce the unacceptably high injury rate among elite pair skaters and ice dancers.\r"

  ".W": "The passive tension resulting from dorsiflexion of the ankle was measured in relation to stretching in six handball players and six soccer players. Corresponding values of ankle angle and passive tension were measured by a strain gauge and a potentiometer connected to a pedal system. The passive tension versus ankle angle was measured before and 90 minutes after a single contract-relax stretching program of the plantar flexors. Stretching lowered the passive tension by up to 18%. Contract-relax stretching performed twice a day for 3 weeks lowered the passive tension in the plantar flexors by up to 36%. Before the last measurements, no stretching was performed for 20 hours or more. Stretching thus had both a short-term effect, matching the length of a training session, and a long-term effect, shown in a reduction of passive tension after 3 weeks. The relative decrease in passive tension after stretching exercises was constant from a neutral position of the ankle to maximal dorsiflexion. There was no correlation between 1) flexibility and the short-term effect of stretching, 2) flexibility and the long-term effect of stretching, or 3) the short-term and long-term effects of stretching. This indicates that passive tension was decreased in all subjects irrespective of their flexibility, and that subjects who had short-term effects after stretching did not necessarily demonstrate a long-term effect.\r"

In this study, 14 athletes who had arthroscopically proven absent ACLs were evaluated in the Biomechanics Laboratory at the Centinela Hospital Medical Center. None of the ligaments were repaired or reconstructed. Footswitch, high speed photography, and force place data were recorded while the athletes performed running and cutting maneuvers with and without their custom fitted C.Ti. braces (Innovation Sports, Irvine, CA). Cybex testing, KT-1000 evaluation, and radiographs were collected for each subject. Statistical analysis showed that while performing cutting maneuvers, braced limbs generated significantly increased shear forces compared to the same limb unbraced. During straight line running, braced limbs generated significantly less lateral and aft shear forces compared to the same limb unbraced. Running velocity increased while wearing a brace for most athletes, but this was not statistically significant. As expected, the sound limb generated significantly greater shear forces than the unbraced involved limb during most cutting maneuvers. Athletes who did not achieve 80% of the Cybex (Cybex, Division of Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY) quadriceps torque of the sound limb generated significantly more forces during cutting maneuvers while wearing their braces. The cutting angle, approach time to the cut, and time on the force plate showed no significant differences during brace wear. We conclude that the C.Ti brace allows significantly better running and cutting performances for athletes who have torn ACLs. Athletes who have not achieved 80% of quadricep strength as measured by Cybex testing showed even more improvement while wearing their braces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By collecting information specific to the musculoskeletal system in addition to that from a general medical examination, information can be gained that may improve performance and help prevent certain injuries. Two thousand one hundred seven athletes from a variety of sports from the junior high to the college level were examined using specific tests for flexibility, strength, and endurance. Females were significantly more flexible than were males on all flexibility measurements, and males were significantly stronger than were females on all strength measurements. Upper-body athletes were tighter in dominant side internal rotation and significantly looser in dominant side external rotation. Lower-body athletes, especially females, were significantly tighter in the leg muscles. These results indicate that the adaptations of the musculo-skeletal system are sport specific and depend on the body area that is placed under stress.\r"

The different hinge designs studied were fixed axis, gear-on-gear, rack-and-pinion, and natural 3-D; they showed only moderate differences in forces. Much larger differences were seen if the hinges were offset 12 mm from the ideal placement. Posterior placement resulted in the least force and anterior placement the highest. The mismatch of knee motion to brace motion would probably lead to abnormal ligament lengths and tensions and other internal mechanical changes, as well as to pistoning and discomfort. The results of this study have implications on brace design, selection, and placement.\r"

At each angle, the anterior-posterior position of the tibia was documented with biplane radiography, both before and after division of the ACL. In every specimen, anterior tibial translation increased with loss of the ACL and was greatest at 25 degrees of flexion, where an average displacement of 3.3 mm was observed. Subluxation was not significant at flexion angles exceeding 60 degrees, regardless of ACL deficiency. We also examined the effect of an external restraining force on tibial subluxation in the ACL deficient knee. Posteriorly directed forces of 0 N, 45 N (10 pounds), 90 N (20 pounds), 135 N (30 pounds), and 225 N (50 pounds) were applied to the tibia at the level of the tibial tubercle. Anterior subluxation was eliminated through application of forces ranging from a maximum of 106 N (23.6 pounds) at 10 degrees to only 13 N (2.9 pounds) at 60 degrees.\r"

At 20 degrees of flexion the internal rotatory laxity was increased on the injured side. The external rotatory laxity did not significantly differ between the two sides. With anterior traction, the internal rotatory laxity increased on both the injured and the normal sides and became almost equal. The external rotatory laxity manifested a decrease which was most pronounced on the injured side. With posterior traction, the rotatory laxities decreased and did not significantly differ between the two sides. Analysis of the simultaneously occurring translations of the tibial plateau disclosed abnormal displacements of both the medial and the lateral tibial condyles on the injured side.\r"

Age range of the patients was 8 to 28 years with greater than 77% being in the 14 to 18 year age range, the high school athlete. Twenty-nine of the fractures occurred in football, 14 in basketball, and the remainder were divided between various other sports. The most common mechanism of injury involved falls or hitting an object such as a helmet or another player. Fractures were evenly divided regarding which digit was involved in football, whereas most basketball injuries occurred in the fourth and fifth metacarpal. Fractures were analyzed as to type of radiographic appearance and this was correlated with time lost from competition or participation. No significant difference among fracture type regarding time lost was noted. Forty-six of the fractures (82%) were minimally displaced or undisplaced and were treated by means of simple casting and/or splinting whereas 10 were displaced. Two of the 10 underwent closed reduction and casting; 3 underwent closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation; and 5 (9%) underwent open reduction internal fixation using AO type plates and screws. All fractures healed primarily clinically and radiographically. The average time lost from practice or competition in this group overall was 13.7 days, (range, 0 to 56 days). Average time lost from basketball was 19.8 days and from football 10.63 days overall. Average time lost from sport in stable fractures treated with casting or splinting was 12.3 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-seven percent of respondents were involved actively in research activities at the time of the survey, although 57% of senior house officers and registrars and 30% of senior registrars would not attempt to acquire publications except to improve their curriculum vitae. Few had received any formal training in research methods. The significance of these findings is discussed with regard to current training opportunities.\r"

A total of 49% patients reported pain during injection of methohexitone; the use of lignocaine either mixed with, or given prior to, methohexitone significantly reduced this to 23% and 20% respectively (p less than 0.05).

The possibility that burn wound excision might adversely affect pulmonary circulation was also investigated. The patients were preanesthetically in a hyperdynamic-hypermetabolic state, characterized by a resting cardiac index (CI) of 6.2 +/- 0.9 L.min-1.m-2 (mean +/- SD), a VO2 (calculated using the Fick principle) of 213 +/- 44 mL.min-1.m-2, a normal mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) (92 +/- 15 mm Hg), and markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (570 +/- 162 dynes.sec.cm-5). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) preanesthetically was slightly increased (21 +/- 3 mm Hg), while pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was in the low-normal range (59 +/- 16 dynes.sec.cm-5). No difference among the effects of enflurane and isoflurane on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and metabolic rate was detected. Induction of anesthesia was associated with a decrease in VO2, CI, MAP, and MPAP (P less than 0.001), while SVR and PVR did not change. The decrease in CI paralleled the decrease in VO2, thereby maintaining whole-body O2 supply-demand balance. VO2 decreased most likely because of lessened tissue O2 requirements. When anesthesia was discontinued, all metabolic and hemodynamic variables promptly returned to preanesthetic values. No effect of burn wound excision on pulmonary circulation was detected.\r"

Recent standardization criteria prompted this study of the vastus and rectus abdominis muscles. This study evaluated changes in contracture tension after electrical stimulation of 271 bundles taken from the vastus (n = 16) and rectus abdominus (n = 19) muscle biopsies of normal individuals when exposed to tissue baths in the absence of and in the presence of caffeine (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 32.0 mM) alone, halothane (1% or 3%) alone, or the combination of halothane (1%) plus caffeine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 32.0). Caffeine threshold concentration was that concentration of caffeine that produced a 7% increase in tension. Caffeine specific concentration (CSC) and halothane caffeine specific concentration (HCSC) were those concentrations of caffeine alone or of halothane plus caffeine that produced a 1 g increase in tension. The concentration of caffeine alone that increased the contracture tension by 7% averaged 6.7 +/- 0.3 mM for vastus, significantly greater than 4.1 +/- 0.2 mM for the rectus muscle biopsies. Caffeine specific concentration was significantly greater for vastus muscle (7.7 +/- 0.7 mM) than it was for rectus muscle (4.9 +/- 0.4 mM). Three percent halothane alone showed contractures in 3/41 vastus (all less than 0.5 g) and 18/54 rectus muscle bundles (8 greater than 0.5 g). Mean HCSC was statistically significantly greater for vastus muscle (1.9 +/- 0.2 mM) than for rectus muscle (1.2 +/- 0.2 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight subjects breathed through an anesthesia face mask connected to a semiclosed anesthesia circuit for two consecutive 10-min periods while 25% and 40% nitrous oxide (N2O) was administered sequentially. Five subjects served as controls and breathed equivalent concentrations of nitrogen. Blood pressure and central venous pressure were recorded from radial artery and jugular vein catheters. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Peroneal nerve recordings were amplified 100,000-fold and integrated for analysis of burst frequency. N2O did not significantly alter respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (mass spectrometry), and diastolic or central venous pressures but did produce small but significant increases in heart rate and systolic pressure compared to time-control (P less than 0.05). In contrast, N2O was associated with progressive, large increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (peak % delta = 69 +/- 22 burst/min [X +/- SEM]) and forearm vascular resistance (30 +/- 4%) and a nonsignificant increase in plasma norepinephrine levels. Thus, brief exposure to 25% and 40% N2O produces striking increases in sympathetic outflow to skeletal muscle in humans.\r"

Onset and duration of antinociceptive effects were also compared. The ED50 values (mg/kg) were determined in mice for pentamorphone (0.0039), fentanyl (0.016), and morphine (7.3). In the rabbit tooth pulp test the ED50 values were 0.0009 mg/kg for pentamorphone, 0.0074 mg/kg for fentanyl, and 1.1 mg/kg for morphine; in the dog tail clamp test these values were 0.012 mg/kg for pentamorphone and 0.018 mg/kg for fentanyl. Duration of action (defined as the time until response to tooth pulp stimulation declined to 50% of maximum possible effect [MPE]) was 10 min with twice the IV ED50 for pentamorphone in mice. This duration was similar to that of the equipotent dose of fentanyl but much shorter than the duration of an equipotent potent dose of morphine (60 min). The duration in rabbits of the ED98 (IV) dose of pentamorphone was 65 min compared to 35 min for an equipotent dose of fentanyl and 200 min for morphine. Intramuscular doses of pentamorphone had significantly faster onset and shorter duration times than equipotent doses of morphine in both mice and rabbits. Pretreatment with naloxone in mice and rabbits attenuated the development of the antinociceptive effects of pentamorphone. This study shows that pentamorphone is a potent analgesic with a duration of action similar to that of fentanyl.\r"

These included needle size, bevel design, bevel orientation, and angle of approach. Using 25-gauge Quincke needles, a 30 degree approach caused a rate of leak across the dura significantly less than those following 60 degree and 90 degree approaches. A significant increase in leak rate was found with 22-gauge Quincke needles when the bevels were oriented so as to be perpendicular rather than parallel to the long axis of the dura. Also, 22-gauge Whitacre needles caused significantly less leak than did 22-gauge Quincke needles, and 25-gauge Quincke needles produced significantly less leak than 22-gauge Quincke needles. If human dura behaves in vivo as it does in this in vitro model, it would be advantageous to perform lumbar puncture using oblique approaches and small needles with conical tips.\r"

With diazepam, a nonbasic lipophilic amine, there was 30% uptake during the first pass through the human lung--significantly less than that observed with verapamil. With thiopental, an acidic lipophilic barbiturate, only 14% of the injected drug accumulated in the lung during the first pass. Taken together, these data are consistent with observations from animal studies, which indicate that extensive pulmonary uptake is greater with basic amine drugs that are moderately to highly lipid-soluble. Also, the relatively high first-pass uptake of verapamil in the human lung suggests a quantitatively significant role of this nonrespiratory function of the lung in the early pharmacokinetics of intravenous verapamil.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamine and renin-angiotensin responses to enflurane- or isoflurane-hypotensive anesthesia were compared in a randomized study. Two groups of 10 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were premedicated with morphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and the trachea intubated after pancuronium. Equal concentrations of each volatile agent (1.3 MAC) were administered until mean arterial blood pressure decreased to 50-60 mm Hg. Hemodynamic data and blood samples for measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were collected 1) after induction and intubation but before the start of isoflurane or enflurane; 2) 15 min (T15) after the start of isoflurane or enflurane administration; and 3) 45 min (T45) after the start of isoflurane or enflurane administration. The desired level of hypotension was achieved at T15 with isoflurane and at T45 with both anesthetics. When hypotension was achieved, cardiac index and stroke index were significantly lower in the enflurane group while systemic vascular resistance index was lower in the isoflurane group. Increases in E and NE levels above baseline levels were significantly greater in the isoflurane group than in the enflurane group. Use of isoflurane to induce hypotension is associated with more rapid induction of hypotension, less depression of cardiac output, and better preservation of homeostatic responses than is use of enflurane.\r"

All underwent urogenital surgery and received caudal analgesia after tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with O2/air at an end-tidal halothane concentration of 0.8%. A pediatric circle system at a fresh gas flow (FGF) of 0.5 and 1.5 x min ventilation (VE) (C0.5 and C1.5, respectively) and a Jackson-Rees system at FGF of 1.5 and 3.0 x VE (JR1.5 and JR3.0, respectively) were used in each patient in a random order. Tidal volume (VT), mean inspiratory flow (VT divided by the duration of inspiration TI, VT/TI), and the initial fast slopes of the airway occlusion pressure phase (delta P degrees/delta t FAST) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) with the Jackson-Rees than with the circle system, indicating greater impedence to spontaneous breathing with the Jackson-Rees system. The Jackson-Rees system also required a greater peak transpulmonary pressure (PtpMAXe) than did the circle system to achieve the same peak expiratory flows (VMAXe, P less than 0.05), again suggesting an increased resistance with the Jackson-Rees system. These results are most likely explained by the difference in elastic loads (two to three times more with the Jackson-Rees systems) between the two systems. The pediatric circle system appears to be a reliable alternative to the Jackson-Rees system.\r"

Anesthesia was maintained with droperidol (droperidol group), with halothane (1.7 MAC, halothane group), or with isoflurane (1.7 MAC, isoflurane group). During the surgical procedure, 1 hr after the induction, a liver biopsy was performed in each patient and processed for light and electron microscopy. All biopsies were normal on light microscopy. On electron microscopy, no mitochondrial abnormalities were found. In all three groups, irregular nuclear membranes, dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and vesiculation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum were seen, without any significant differences between the groups. There were significantly more lysosomes in the hepatocytes of patients receiving halothane than in the hepatocytes of patients receiving isoflurane or droperidol. This study shows that halothane can induce ultrastructure abnormalities very early after the beginning of its administration while, under the same conditions, isoflurane does not.\r"

Hypobaric spinal anesthesia was performed on 20 patients for total hip arthroplasty. Dural puncture was performed with a 22-gauge Whitacre needle. All patients received 10 mg of hypobaric tetracaine with epinephrine. An electrically driven syringe pump was used to inject the anesthetic solution at either slow (250 sec) or fast (10 sec) rates. Ten patients received slow injections, and 10 received fast injections. Anesthetic levels, duration of anesthesia, and specific gravities of injectate and CSF were measured. Slow injection resulted in less spread of spinal anesthesia. Four-segment regression of anesthetic levels took significantly longer in the slow injection group. Local anesthetic mixtures used were consistently hypobaric compared to patient CSF. We conclude that slow injection of hypobaric tetracaine through a 22-gauge Whitacre needle produces lower levels of spinal anesthesia that tend to be of longer duration than levels resulting from fast injection.\r"

Highly purified smooth-muscle myosin and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) were prepared from fresh turkey gizzards, and the phosphorylation of the myosin light-chain in the presence of Ca++ and calmodulin was evaluated by the urea gel-electrophoresis. Tetracaine 1.3.10(-3) M and bupivacaine 7.5.10(-3) M inhibited the MLCK 50%, whereas lidocaine 2.5.10(-2) M inhibited the MLCK 40%. The inhibitory action was partially reversed by increasing the calcium ion concentration from 1.10(-5) to 2.10(-4) M. On the other hand, raising the calmodulin concentration from 1.10(-7) M to 6.10(-7) M completely reversed the inhibition. A possible cause of the discrepancy in the anesthetic concentrations between subcellular and in vivo studies is discussed.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol. Twelve asthmatic patients (FEV1, 81 +/- 4% predicted), requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy, were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol (HDS), 4,000 micrograms daily, low dose inhaled salbutamol (LDS), 800 micrograms daily, or placebo (PI) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. During the 14-day run-in and during washout periods, inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and ipratropium bromide was substituted for rescue purposes. At the end of each 14-day treatment, a dose-response curve (DRC) was performed, and airway (FEV1, FEF25-75) chronotropic (HR), tremor, and metabolic (K, Glu) responses were measured at each step (from 100 to 4,000 micrograms). Treatment had no significant effect on baseline values. There were dose-dependent increases in FEV1 and FEF25-75 (p less than 0.001), and pretreatment with HDS did not displace the DRC to the right. DRC for HR (p less than 0.001), K (p less than 0.001), and Glu (p less than 0.005) were attenuated after treatment with HDS compared with PI. There were also differences between HDS and LDS for HR (p less than 0.001) and Glu (p less than 0.05) responses. Frequency and severity of subjective adverse effects were also reduced after HDS: tremor (p less than 0.001), palpitations (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was concluded that the rate of airway rewarming is an important event in asthma provoked by exercise. It is also possible, however, that the enhanced response was due to hypo-osmolarity caused by condensation of water from inspired air at BTPS on the cooled mucosa. We examined, in a group of boys with asthma, the response to rapid rewarming of the airways after exercise, with and without the potential for condensation. On two test days, two exercise tests were performed 4 h apart on a cycle ergometer. On Day 1 (n = 17), the inspired air during exercise was -5 degrees C, dry. During recovery, the air was either -5 degrees C, dry or 50 degrees C, 23 mg H2O/L. On Day 2 (n = 11), the inspired air during exercise was -15 degrees C, dry, and during recovery was either -15 degrees C, dry or at BTPS. We did not find enhancement of the response with either condition designed to cause rapid airway rewarming. On Day 1 the mean (+/- 1 SD) percent fall in FEV1 was 23 +/- 22 (-5 degrees C, dry) and 24 +/- 21 (50 degrees C, 23 mg H2O/L) (r = 0.92), and on Day 2 it was 19 +/- 17 (-15 degrees C, dry) and 18 +/- 17 (BTPS) (r = 0.96).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The midexpiratory glottic narrowing that normally occurs during tidal breathing is enhanced during histamine- or methacholine-induced airway narrowing. Exercise is associated with increased ventilatory demand and midexpiratory glottic widening in healthy subjects. However, the relative contribution of glottic aperture to airflow limitation during exercise-induced asthma is unknown. Consequently, we used the acoustic reflection technique to test whether a decrease in midexpiratory glottic size occurred also during exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in seven asthmatic subjects. Exercise resulted in a 38 +/- 16% (SD) fall in FEV1 from the baseline value (p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in midexpiratory glottic cross-sectional area from 1.89 +/- 0.45 cm2 before to 2.36 +/- 0.71 cm2 during bronchoconstriction (p less than 0.05). This midexpiratory glottic widening was also associated with increased tidal flow rates. We conclude that in marked contrast to airway obstruction induced by histamine or methacholine, exercise-induced asthma is associated with midexpiratory glottic widening, which occurs concomitantly with a decrease in lower airway caliber. We suggest that modulation of glottic aperture during acute asthma is heterogeneous and depends partly on the initiating stimulus.\r"

Salbutamol was equally effective in reversing LTD4- and LTE4-induced Cdyn changes. Aerosolized LY171883 Na was effective against both agonists, but was about threefold more potent against LTE4. In contrast, atropine was very effective in reversing LTD4-induced Cdyn changes, but produced minimal reversal when LTE4 was the challenge agent. Pulmonary gas trapping results supported these observations; ELGV values were closely correlated with 5-min Cdyn measurements for both LTD4 (r = -0.817) and LTE4 (r = -0.831). Thus, although LTD4 and LTE4 are though to act on the same or similar receptors, the pattern of pharmacologic reversal at comparable levels of airway obstruction differs for these two agonists.\r"

After a two-week observation period to establish baseline, subjects were given the same dose of budesonide as they would be for beclomethasone dipropionate; however, the frequency regimen (BID or QID) was randomly allocated. Subjects were asked to fill in diary cards describing their asthmatic symptoms, need for medication, and throat symptoms. They were assessed by a physician every 4 wk, at which time spirometry was performed. Throat swabs were done at every other monthly visit. Cortisol and response to cortisol after synthetic ACTH injection were assessed at the beginning and end of the trial. Thirty-six subjects, half in each group, completed the study. Those on the BID regimen had almost twice as many days with nocturnal asthma and cough and almost three times as many days with disability due to asthma. There were also twice as many relapses in the BID regimen as judged by the clinician. These relapses mainly occurred toward the end of the study. The maximal daily swings in peak expiratory flow rates were slightly greater in the BID group, although this difference was not physiologically significant. Spirometry, cortisol secretion, and the response after synthetic ACTH injection were not significantly different in either group from the beginning to the end of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary function measures derived from the maximal expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curve included FVC, FEV1, maximal expiratory flow after 50% of vital capacity had been expired (Vmax50), and maximal midexpiratory flow (FEF25-75). The lung function and somatic growth longitudinal data were characterized by a nonparametric polynomial smoothing spline model. This procedure yields an optimal fitted curve through the data, an estimate of the growth velocity curve, and 95% confidence bands. Temporal relationships between the fitted growth curves were determined examining the ages at which the growth velocity peaks (GVP) occur. In addition, the age of growth cessation was estimated using lower limits of the 95% confidence bands of each growth velocity curve. The results indicate that the point estimates of the somatic GVPs precede all peak lung function measurements derived from the MEFV curve in both males and females. The only statistically significant difference between when the GVPs for somatic growth and functional lung growth occurred was for FEV1 and FEF25-75 in males, though similar trends were apparent in all other variables, suggesting that the timing of maximal body growth velocity precedes that of maximal lung functional growth and that the early growth spurt in females includes the lungs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From this cross-sectional analysis, it is apparent that cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in DL that occurs very soon after beginning the cigarette habit. There is an irreversible decrease in DL with cumulative cigarette consumption, but also a reversible phenomenon that leads to rapid improvement in DL on smoking cessation.\r"

Atropine infusion had no effect on any of the variables measured. Ibuprofen infusion immediately reduced mean Ppa from 31 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 24 +/- 2 cm H2O (p less than 0.05). Metaproterenol and ibuprofen immediately increased Cdyn and SGaw and decreased RL to near baseline (p less than 0.05). No intervention affected delta AaPO2 (p greater than 0.05). In sheep treated with metaproterenol, propranolol immediately returned lung mechanics (p less than 0.05) to premetaproterenol levels without affecting delta AaPO2 (p greater than 0.05). Ibuprofen reduced lung lymph thromboxane-B2 towards baseline levels (p less than 0.05). We conclude that endotoxemia causes prolonged bronchoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension in sheep, which is largely mediated by constrictor prostanoids rather than by cholinergic mechanisms and is reversible with ibuprofen given 2.5 h after endotoxin.\r"

The prevalence of MF antibody among nonsmokers was significantly higher than that among smokers: 27.1% versus 7.7% in 1979, 31.3% versus 2.9% in 1984. There was no remarkable change in overall prevalences of MF antibody between 1979 and 1984 (18.5 and 19.6%, respectively). However, out of 17 seropositive farmers, six (35%) became seronegative, and out of 75 seronegative farmers, seven (9.3%) became seropositive after 5 yr. The nonsmoking farmers who remained seronegative throughout the follow-up period were older and had worked longer on farms than the farmers with seroconversion. These results suggest that in addition to smoking habits, age and exposure time to MF influence the immune response to MF in dairy farmers. Out of 11 farmers who remained seropositive throughout the 5-yr period, two (18.2%) developed FLD. Therefore, continuously positive MF antibody is one of the risk factors in the development of FLD.\r"

Because no comprehensive survey was carried out, more such deaths probably occurred. With one exception, the patients were not seen or contacted monthly throughout the course of treatment. However, in 16 patients where the information was known, eight were seen by a member of the group giving the isoniazid (INH) within 30 days prior to the patients presenting with hepatitis. In 12 of 17 cases, symptoms were present for 7 days or more before the patient presented for medical care. In at least 35% of cases where the information was known, a management error occurred, usually failing to immediately stop INH when the patient presented with symptoms. The duration of treatment before hepatitis developed varied from 9 to 53 wk. Four of the 20 patients had cholelithiasis or a history of cholelithiasis. With one possible exception, no excessive alcohol use was noted. Concomitant acetaminophen, barbiturate, and tetracycline use occurred in several cases. There were no deaths in Orientals. Sixteen of the 20 deaths occurred in women who had started to receive INH between the ages of 15 and 55. Four of these women began receiving INH during pregnancy and continued it postpartum. Eight deaths occurred in persons starting INH before 35 yr of age. The continued occurrence of INH-associated deaths suggests that indications and precautions for INH preventive treatment be carefully reconsidered.\r"

The sleep apnea group was composed of eight patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea, and the non-apnea group was composed of five patients without significant sleep apnea. We chose the time constant of relaxation (TauR) as an index of impaired inspiratory muscle contractility, and in subsets of each group, we measured the inspiratory pressure-time index as an indicator of a fatiguing breathing pattern. In patients with sleep apnea, presleep TauR was 79 +/- 22 ms (SD), longer than that of normal subjects (normal, 59 +/- 7 ms) (p less than 0.05). TauR increased by 21 +/- 16 ms during sleep (p less than 0.01). In patients without apnea, presleep TauR was 67 +/- 7 ms and it did not change after sleep. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures were unchanged after sleep. We conclude that patients with sleep apnea do not develop overt inspiratory muscle failure but do have impaired contractility. We speculate that hypoxemia as well as increased work load was responsible.\r"

However, little is known about morphologic features of the pharynx in patients with OSA. We therefore studied the tissue composition of the uvula (midsagittal section) in patients with OSA, using a quantitative, morphometric point-counting technique. Uvula tissue was obtained by uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) in 33 patients (mean number of apneas per hour of sleep = 32.7 +/- 5.2) and by autopsy in 22 normal subjects not known to have OSA. All statistical comparisons were controlled for differences caused by age and body mass index. Patients with OSA had a significantly greater percentage of muscle in the uvula (18.1 +/- 1.9% versus 9.3 +/- 2.1%, p = 0.02) than did normal subjects. A significant difference in fat content was also found (9.5 +/- 1.4% in patients versus 4.0 +/- 1.0% in normal subjects, p less than 0.02). These differences between patients with OSA and control subjects could not be accounted for by anthropometric or sex differences. The percentage of uvula fat tissue was significantly related to the frequency of apneas and hypopneas in sleep (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01). Uvula morphology in 6 nonapneic snorers undergoing UPPP was similar to that of patients with OSA. We conclude that the uvula in patients with OSA contains more muscle and fat than the uvula in control subjects, possibly contributing to pharyngeal narrowing in OSA.\r"

Symptoms obtained after the challenge were related to morphologic changes within and on the surface of the nasal mucosa. Cell samples were obtained daily prior to challenge from the nasal mucosa using mucosal imprints on plastic strips, brush samplings from the nasal mucosa, and nasal lavage. For light microscopy, the cellular material obtained by brushing and nasal lavage were cytocentrifuged onto object slides. Histamine was measured in the cell pellets that were obtained using the lavage and brush procedures as well as in the lavage supernatant fluid. Four symptoms (sneezes, itching, secretion, and blockage) were recorded and expressed individually as well as in the form of a composite symptom score. Nasal blockage was measured using a nasal peak flow meter. The patients displayed an increase in nasal symptoms after the allergen challenge, which was further increased between Days 2 to 7 (p less than 0.05). The light microscopic evaluation of the lavage revealed an immediate increase in eosinophils from 2.3 to 13.1% and was maintained on the same level throughout the period of challenges. A similar increase was noted in the brush specimens, and a strong correlation was obtained between these two methods of sampling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary mast cells were exposed to unilateral alveolar hypoxia by ventilating one lung of a cat with nitrogen. Mast cells from the contralateral lung, which was simultaneously ventilated with air, were used as a control. The granule content of perivascular and airway mast cells was determined from electron micrographs using morphometric methods. In response to alveolar hypoxia there was a 12% (p less than 0.005) decrease in the granule content of perivascular mast cells but no statistically significant change in periairway mast cell content. Perivascular mast cells from the hypoxic lungs did not show any of the morphological changes seen in IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, such as granule swelling, fusion, or exocytosis. In the hypoxic lung, morphometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of heterogeneous-appearing granules in the perivascular mast cells. The different reactivity of perivascular and periairway mast cells may explain why alveolar hypoxia does not induce significant bronchospasm.\r"

However, it is unclear just how many mast cells are present in the lumen of normal or hyperreactive airways, in part because of differences in the histochemical techniques that have been used to identify mast cells and questions about the heterogeneity of mast cells. The present study was done (1) to compare the effectiveness of six techniques in the identification of mast cells obtained from dogs by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), (2) to compare the mast cells in the airways of normal mongrel dogs with those from a breed of dog (Basenji-Greyhound) known to have bronchial hyperreactivity, and (3) to determine whether the two-type histochemical classification used for rodent mast cells (formaldehyde-resistant or typical and formaldehyde-sensitive or atypical) applies meaningfully to the mast cells in BAL fluid from dogs. Cells obtained by BAL were fixed with Mota's basic lead acetate or formaldehyde. Mast cells were identified by metachromatic staining with toluidine blue or methylene blue, staining of highly sulfated proteoglycans with Alcian blue or berberine sulfate, and a histochemical reaction for chloroacetate esterase (mast cell chymase). After Mota's fixation, the methods were relatively similar in their effectiveness in determining the number of mast cells in lavage fluid from the mongrel dogs, in that all of the values fell within a narrow range: 0.53 to 0.96% of the total number of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Factors controlling neutrophil migration into the lung are poorly understood, but their identification is important for our understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases. Pulmonary inflammation is difficult to quantify, and neutrophils in tissues and BAL may not accurately represent cell migration. In this study, intravenously delivered pulses of rabbit neutrophils labeled with Indium-111 (111In-neutrophils) were used to monitor neutrophil migration into the lungs. Radioactivity quantified in the lung \"region of interest\" (ROI) of external gamma camera scintigrams recorded 24 h after intravenous 111In-neutrophil injection accurately reflected the actual neutrophil-associated lung tissue radioactivity. ROI radioactivity at 24 h also correlated closely with the percent of 111In-neutrophils that had migrated into lavageable air spaces, and this parameter therefore provided an index of total lung 111In-neutrophil migration. Using 24-h ROI radioactivity and percent of injected 111In-neutrophils recovered in BAL at 24 h as indices of neutrophil migration into the lung, it was found that intratracheal saline caused only a transient neutrophil migration, whereas 10 U/kg intratracheal bleomycin induced migration that persisted for as long as 3 wk. 111In-neutrophil migration into the lung, assessed by external scintigraphy, correlated with total neutrophils quantified in histologic sections (r = 0.71, p = 0.006). The data suggest that this approach will be valuable in investigating mechanisms controlling neutrophil migration in lung inflammation, and that 111In-neutrophil scintigraphy may provide a noninvasive index of total lung neutrophil load that might be useful in staging inflammation in patchy diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

Recent investigations, however, indicate that both acute lung injury and pulmonary venous hypertension can be important in the pathogenesis of pleural effusions. To evaluate the role of acute lung injury in the formation of pleural effusions, we developed a model of acute, reversible lung injury in NZW rabbits. Intravenous ethchlorvynol (ECV), known to produce permeability edema in humans, was used to produce permeability pulmonary edema in rabbits. The injury was examined over 14 days with bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural fluid analysis, and morphologic analysis. Ethchlorvynol injection (40 mg/kg) produced a PMN-predominant, exudative alveolitis (2 h), alveolar hemorrhage (6 to 10 h), and pleural effusions by 2 h (peak, 10 h). Pathologic findings included a patchy, subpleural, hemorrhagic PMN inflammatory response, which peaked by 24 h, and an acute PMN vasculitis of small arterioles and capillaries; these changes resolved in 5 to 7 days. No parietal pleural abnormalities were observed. We conclude that ECV induces an acute, reversible parenchymal lung injury resulting in a capillary leak and that fluid moves from the interstitium of the lung into the pleural space along a pressure gradient through a relatively permeable mesothelium. The data support the concept that diffuse or localized lung injury can result in pleural effusions.\r"

When plasma from the patients was given intravenously to mice or to guinea pigs, the animals became immobile within 2 min and died at 3 to 30 min after the injection. Multiple thrombosis was found in the lungs and was considered to be the cause of the death. Thrombosis was not formed and the mice survived when heparin was given intravenously 5 min before the injection of the plasma. This TIA was present in plasma from 13 of 42 patients with lung cancer. On the contrary, only two of 32 with chronic lung diseases and two of 31 healthy control subjects had this activity in the plasma. The coagulation system in the 13 patients was considered to be chronically activated, as revealed by elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels, fibrin degradation product levels, and/or peripheral platelet counts. The TIA shared characteristics with tissue factor in that it was heat labile, nondialyzable through a dialysis membrane with a 10,000 molecular weight exclusion limit, sensitive to phospholipase C treatment, precipitated by 50% ammonium sulfate, and bound to concanavalin-A Sepharose.\r"

  ".W": "To assess metabolic functions of the pulmonary circulation during lung injury and subsequent recovery from injury, we measured angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by means of benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP) hydrolysis and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) removal in vivo in three groups of anesthetized rabbits. One group was treated with 30 micrograms/kg/day phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) intravenously 10 times over 14 days (PMA group). A second group received the same PMA treatment but was not studied until 14 days after the last treatment (PMA/recovery group). A third group was treated with vehicle alone. At the end of PMA treatment, rabbits had an elevated pulmonary artery pressure and depressed ACE activity, expressed as the ratio Vmax/Km. Decreased Vmax/Km for ACE was due to a significant reduction in apparent Vmax for BPAP (control = 235 +/- 37, PMA = 139 +/- 12 nmol/s). Km was unchanged (control = 25 +/- 4, PMA = 31 +/- 7 microM). Uptake of 5-HT was unaffected by PMA treatment. After 2 wk of recovery (PMA/recovery group), pulmonary hypertension had resolved. In this group, Vmax for BPAP hydrolysis was not significantly different from control (280 +/- 18 nmol/s), but Km was significantly increased (48 +/- 5 microM). We conclude that repeated exposure of rabbits to PMA results in lung injury manifested as depressed pulmonary ACE activity and pulmonary artery hypertension. Although much of these alterations were reversible within 2 wk after discontinuing PMA, an increase in apparent Km of ACE may be a more persistent alteration in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Although several studies have examined the duration of the bronchodilator effect of several inhaled beta-2-adrenergic agents, the duration of the blocking effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, another key feature of asthma, has seldom been studied. We investigated this problem in eight adult asthmatic subjects who underwent hyperventilation tests with dry cold air on 4 different days. On the first day, five hyperventilation tests with assessment of the level of ventilation causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) were obtained to evaluate the within-day variability of the test. On the three other visits, after a baseline hyperventilation test, albuterol 200 micrograms, terbutaline 500 micrograms, and terbutaline 1,500 micrograms were administered in a double-blind, randomized way. Hyperventilation tests were carried out 1, 2, 4, and 6 h later. The blocking effect on the treatment days, as assessed by the differences in PD20 for each test compared with baseline PD20 for that day, was corrected for the within-day variability of the control day. There was a significant bronchodilator effect 1 h after administering the drug; it was equivalent for albuterol 200 micrograms (25.6 +/- 14.7%) and terbutaline 1,500 micrograms (21.7 +/- 13.5%) and significantly less for terbutaline 500 micrograms (14.1 +/- 10.0%). Complete or partial blockade on bronchial responsiveness was obtained in the majority (six to seven of eight) of the subjects 1 h after inhaling the bronchodilator, with progressive reduction in the effect later on. Four subjects still showed a blocking effect 6 h after terbutaline 1,500 micrograms was administered, one subject after terbutaline 500 micrograms, and no subjects after albuterol (chi square = 6.6, p = 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

(1) 129 patients with severe chronic airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 1,880 ml, range 1,200 to 2,500 ml); (3) 81 patients out of group 2 with decline in FEV1 over time, without oral corticosteroids. It is clear that, at least in the presence of regular therapy, next to cessation of smoking, a higher reversibility of airflow obstruction and lower degree of airway hyperreactivity are important predictors of a slower decline in FEV1. In our opinion these findings point to the urgency for clinicians to change the nihilistic attitude towards patients with CAO, in that both smoking cessation and an early therapy directed at the reversible part of airflow obstruction and airway hyperreactivity may be able to prevent deterioration. Future studies have to show whether long-term, ongoing therapy with corticosteroids may even change the progression and survival in far advanced disease.\r"

  ".W": "The National Mortality Database of Statistics Canada was used to study chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality trends between 1950 and 1984 by age, sex, birth cohort, and province. Provincial hospital statistics were combined for the period 1971 to 1984 to determine age-specific hospital separation rates for COPD. Utilization of physician services for COPD was determined for one province using physicians' claims for payment. Results of these analyses indicate that mortality from COPD has leveled off for men and is increasing for women; the trend is different for combined chronic bronchitis-emphysema and for asthma. Mortality from COPD varies by age, sex, birth cohort, and province. Mortality from COPD stopped increasing with the 1910 to 1914 birth cohort in men and the 1920 to 1924 in women. Male and female birth cohorts born after 1920 to 1924 have decreased mortality. It is speculated that the age-standardized mortality will decrease in the near future. Surveys of smoking habits over time support the hypothesis that a proportion of sex, birth cohort, regional, and socio-economic variation of COPD mortality is due to smoking. Hospital morbidity is higher for men than for women particularly for those more than 65 yr of age. Between 1971 and 1983, mortality/morbidity ratios were relatively stable. Asthma mortality and morbidity are increasing; changing concepts about the disease may be one reason for this observation.\r"

COPD mortality is highest in the Eastern European countries and Ireland, Scotland, and England/Wales, and is lowest in southern Europe, Japan, and Israel. That these differences are large and real is a likelihood but not a certainty, due to problems in comparability of cause-of-death statistics. In the past, the trend in COPD mortality has been upwards. Over the short time period of 1980 to 1985, there have been substantial declines in death rates in most countries for the major causes of death, but not for COPD or lung cancer. It is not clear, however, whether COPD mortality is continuing to increase everywhere. In only nine countries is the trend upwards and only in women above age 55 and in men above age 75. In the other 22 countries, trends are not clearly upwards or downwards. Longer time trend statistics are needed to corroborate and explain these patterns and the apparent intercountry differences.\r"

It was found that rates of diagnoses increased from initial surveys within each age group, possibly due to the effect of the study per se. The rates increased even more in each age cohort until age 65, demonstrating the effects of aging. Cohort changes in smoking were greater than cross-sectional differences between age groups. The incidence rates of diagnoses with functional impairment are about 7/1000 and are greater in smokers and in males. The new cases of AOD were defined both by functional impairment and/or physician diagnoses. They had lower pulmonary function at the initial examination. This implies a natural history of AOD that starts well before clinical diagnoses. New cases of diseases had a variegated set of associated risk factors. In addition to smoking, there were contributions made by reports of childhood respiratory disease, family history, occupational exposures, alcohol consumption, and IgE (in asthma alone or with other AOD). Use of reported diagnostic endpoints as well as functional impairment contributed more to the understanding of the possible etiology of AOD. Some increases in AOD rates may be a function of more careful study, but cohort rate increases seen in a careful longitudinal study show that a real increase in AOD is likely.\r"

COPD was mentioned on the death certificates of 11% (102) of deceased men and 13% (24) of deceased women. Forty-one percent of these deaths was attributed to COPD as the underlying cause and the remainder to COPD as a contributory cause. Usage of diagnostic terms changed during the course of the study; emphysema was mentioned on 81% of certificates completed prior to 1968, whereas COPD was entered on 77% of the certificates written after 1978. Proportional mortality rates of COPD increased from 8% during 1959 to 1967 to 13.3% during 1979 to 1987 among men, and from 2.7% during the earlier years to 4.3% during the later years among women. Death rates for COPD and for all causes combined increased among men from the early 1960s to the late 1970s, then declined. Death rates for all causes combined were stable among women, but COPD death rates may have increased. Prevalence rates for chronic bronchitis were lower at the third examination than at the second in both sexes. Prevalence of obstructive airway disease was highest at the first and lower at the second and third examinations in men but not in women. Agreement between study diagnoses of COPD and entry of COPD on death certificates was poor. COPD was recorded on the death certificate for only 21% of men and only 6% of women who had COPD diagnosed at a study examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first examined the mortality of a private census population (greater than 35,000 whites) enumerated in 1963 over two subsequent time periods by age, sex, and initial smoking status. The second examined the 10-yr mortality of a subset of the 1963 census (884 men who had undergone spirometry). We observed a fall in age-adjusted mortality from all causes and from arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD), but an increase in COPD mortality. However, the increase in these chronic pulmonary deaths is essentially confined to persons who were smoking cigarettes at the beginning of the study period. Furthermore, while smokers showed an increased mortality risk for all causes, the excess mortality risk did not fall uniformly across cigarette smokers. It is a major observation of this study that all-cause and cardiovascular (as well as pulmonary) mortality are significantly more often found among subjects with ventilatory impairment (independent of smoking status). Reasons for the association of ASHD mortality with impaired forced expiration are discussed. Thus, men at increased risk for three (ASHD, lung cancer, COPD) of the five leading causes of death (three of eight for women) may be identified by spirometry. Perhaps it is time that this test was more generally applied.\r"

Whether this is due to changes in coding or diagnostic practices, increase in disease incidence or severity, or other causes is unknown. The Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) has followed a cohort of 11,136 Japanese-American men, 45 to 65 yr of age at onset, from 1965 to 1984. Following a fixed protocol, study physicians assigned cause of death after review of hospital records, pathology and autopsy reports, the death certificate, and, in doubtful cases, after interview with family and personal physician. The eighth revision of the international Classification of Diseases was used throughout. During 20 yr of follow-up, 2,624 men died, 113 from COPD by HHP coding and 105 from COPD by State Health Department (HD) coding. There was no change in age-adjusted or age-specific COPD mortality rates from 1965 to 1984 by HHP coding (tests for trend, p greater than 0.05). In contrast, when HD coding was used there was a significant decline in COPD mortality over the same time period. The frequency with which COPD was found on the death certificate decreased significantly for diagnoses listed in Section 1 and increased for those in Section 2. Current smokers showed increasing trends and past smokers decreasing trends in COPD mortality. When HHP and HD codings were compared, there was agreement in only 46% (69 of 149) of the cases. Agreement was greater in 1965-1974 than in 1975-1984. This study found no evidence of increasing mortality rates from 1965 to 1984 in this cohort of Japanese-American men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Death rates from COPD for the veterans by smoking status were compared with U.S. death rates for white males 55 to 84 yr of age over the same period. The main findings were that the veterans experienced sharp increases in COPD mortality over the 26-yr study period, much like the U.S. findings. However, the observed increases were not as great as those for the United States. The COPD rates for veterans who were cigarette smokers showed the same pattern as for all veterans. Some important differences by age were noted. Thus, for ages 60 to 64 and 65 to 69, the direction of the trend among veterans appeared to change from initial increases in the COPD death rate to later decreases while at the same time the three oldest age groups (70-74, 75-79, and 80-84) continued to experience increases in mortality over the whole period. These findings were similar to those for the United States. Several possible explanatory factors for these changes are discussed.\r"

COPD was the underlying cause for only one third of all death certificates listing COPD. Small changes in classification will have a major impact on reported COPD death rates. Cigarette smoking is clearly the primary determinant of COPD mortality. Decreased pulmonary function is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. Smoking cessation results in a slower rate of decline in pulmonary function over time, especially among heavy smokers. Careful evaluation of smoking cessation, including repeat chemical measures, suggest that the percentage of long-term quitters, especially among heavy smokers has been overestimated. The low percentage of quitters substantially reduced the power to detect an intervention effect. The increased cigarette smoking among recent older cohorts, and failure to substantially reduce smoking, especially among heavy smokers, may be an important factor accounting for the failure to note a decline in COPD mortality among older persons.\r"

  ".U": "89391198\r", 
  ".W": "Since the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health was released in 1964, the United States has achieved substantial progress in curtailing smoking. Per capita cigarette sales for persons 18 yr of age or older have declined each year since 1973. Total cigarette sales have fallen an average of 1.8% each year since 1982, despite the increasing size of the population. National population-based surveys show that the prevalence of smoking has fallen steadily among adults during the past quarter century. Unfortunately, a parallel decrease in mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the most important smoking-related diseases, has not occurred. To estimate the current impact of smoking on mortality from COPD, we used a modified formula for population attributable risk to calculate the mortality and years of potential life lost due to COPD caused by smoking. In 1984, an estimated 51,013 deaths occurred from COPD caused by smoking: 35,638 among men (85% of total COPD mortality) and 15,376 among women (69% of total COPD mortality) (sum does not equal total due to rounding). These deaths resulted in a total loss of 501,290 yr of life before the average life expectancy. We conclude that cigarette smoking continues to cause a heavy burden of premature death from COPD in the United States. This burden may increase in the coming years despite decreasing smoking rates because the residual risk of COPD mortality among former smokers persists for many years.\r"

These data are reviewed briefly. Findings in these subjects are then compared with those in \"COPD\" patients enrolled in an \"emphysema clinic\" in Chicago many years ago; patients with asthmatic features had been systematically excluded from the Chicago series. The rate of decline in FEV1 and mortality of Arizona subjects considered to have \"typical COPD\" were remarkably similar to those in the Chicago series after accounting for age and initial FEV1, but Arizona subjects with features suggesting \"chronic asthmatic bronchitis\" had a much more favorable prognosis than either of the \"COPD\" groups. These different forms of chronic airways obstruction should be distinguished in clinical or epidemiologic studies of airways obstructive disorders.\r"

They thus have added support to the concept of partial laryngectomy for selected lesions and have illustrated the features of those types of laryngeal cancer that have not responded well to radiotherapy. Whole organ sections of laryngectomy specimens have allowed a more accurate interpretation of preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and have provided a reliable basis for clinical staging.\r"

If the vibratory characteristics could be restored in these scarred vocal cords, the vocal intensity and efficiency of phonation also should improve. In an effort to enhance the vibration of damaged vocal cords, we implanted a submucosal fat autograft within the injured vocal cord cover layer of dogs 6 weeks after unilateral mucosal excision had been performed. Three months postoperatively these animals were compared to normal dogs and those with mucosal excision but no fat-grafting. Acoustic and biomechanical measures of phonation were collected from an excised larynx preparation. We found that the fat-augmented vocal cords had lower threshold pressures for phonation, greater vocal intensity, and more efficient acoustic output than injured vocal cords without the fat-grafting. These results provide a foundation for further research on reconstructive surgery of damaged vocal cords.\r"

Long-term success has been achieved in 74% of the bilateral group and 88% of the unilateral group. Successful reinnervation of unilateral paralyses usually maintains voice correction indefinitely, but there is late (2 to 5 years postsurgery) deterioration of successful airway restoration in approximately 17% of bilateral cases, which appears to be due to development of cricoarytenoid arthritis.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate far field brain stem recordings following stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve to determine whether laryngeal brain stem response is a valid measure of laryngeal activity at the brain stem level. The nerve was stimulated electrically in adult cats, and the resultant laryngeal adductor response as well as far field brain stem activity was recorded. For the latter, six reproducible positive and five reproducible negative waves were obtained via posterior pharyngeal (+) and posterior cervical (-) recording electrodes. Response threshold and latencies were measured and evaluated as a function of stimulus parameters. Wave latencies corresponded closely to those reported in prior near and far field evoked response recordings.\r"

In addition, a surgical technique of rhinotomy with medial maxillectomy is presented that includes maneuvers designed to prevent these complications.\r"

The examiner in each case was unaware of the findings of the other evaluation method. After definitive treatment had been carried out so that pathologic and operative information was also available, comparisons of the accuracies of the two methods of staging were made. In 32 cases, IVL provided information equal to or better than that provided by DL, and a tissue sample also could be obtained during IVL. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that aggressive, office-based IVL can guide initial treatment planning (partial or total laryngectomy versus irradiation) and patient counseling. A confirmatory DL can be performed without surprises at the time of definitive surgery, rather than as a separate procedure - a cost-effective modification of standard practice.\r"

These groups are evaluated as to the long-term results of surgical treatment with or without concurrent allergic desensitization. The great majority of patients benefited from the surgical treatment regardless of their allergic status. Postoperatively, the allergic patients had more subjective symptoms than those having only infection. A major conclusion was that the long-term benefit to the patient as a result of the operation performed by experienced hands does override the potential risks of ethmoid surgery.\r"

One hundred twenty-five intact temporal bones from 83 children of known sex, race, and age between birth and 20 years were measured. Thickness was measured with a specially designed micrometer at specific locations from a fixed reference point by use of a surface projected grid for site identification. Thickness was plotted against age on scattergraphs for each site, and regression analysis revealed a bimodal linear relationship. Sites medial to the temporalis muscle were the thinnest; sites associated with the posteroinferior insertion of the temporalis muscle, along the supramastoid crest, were the thickest. However, wide interindividual variability was the rule.\r"

In normal ears the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane contained a considerably higher concentration of HA (60 to 200 micrograms/g) than the pars tensa and areas of the medial wall (2 to 7 micrograms/g). In purulent otitis media the pars flaccida contained less HA than in normal ears. The HA concentrations were lower in purulent (3 to 40 micrograms/mL) than in serous (20 to 190 micrograms/mL) effusions. The weight average molecular weight of HA in serous fluid was high (greater than 10(6] and comparable to that in lymph.

However, we do not know the limits for OKAN parameters in normal humans. Accordingly, we studied OKAN in 30 normal subjects using a \"sampling\" method, in which a number of values of OKAN are obtained by turning out the lights periodically during optokinetic stimulation. We found that the initial velocity of OKAN has a large intrasubject variability. Accordingly, if precision is desired so as to obtain 95% confidence that the measured mean of the initial velocity of OKAN is within 25% of the true mean in an individual subject, at least eight measurements of the initial OKAN velocity must be taken. When 12 measurements are made, all subjects had a minimum value of 5 degrees/s initial OKAN, and there was little directional asymmetry (mean of -0.47 degree/s +/- 3.13 degrees/s). The intrasubject variability of the time constant of OKAN was similar to the variability of initial OKAN velocity. However, because it is not possible to obtain repeated measures of the time constant in a short period of time, the time constant of OKAN is less likely to be useful in clinical testing.\r"
