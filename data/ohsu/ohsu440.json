Indications were limb salvage in seven and claudication in five. After successful stenting, ankle-brachial indexes improved by 0.15 or more in 11 of 12 patients (mean increase, 0.40), transstenotic pressure gradients decreased to less than 5 mm Hg (mean, 0.58 mm Hg) in all patients, and improvement in clinical grade was seen in all patients. At follow-up at 1-14 months (median, 6 months), ankle-brachial indexes were stable (mean, 0.95), and clinical grades were unchanged in all patients. Complications occurred in two patients; both experienced distal embolization, and one, who was receiving corticosteroid therapy, also suffered stent thrombosis. Local surgical embolectomy was successful in both patients, and the thrombosed stent was recanalized with urokinase. This early experience suggests that stenting may play an important role in the management of iliac occlusions, especially in poor surgical candidates.\r"

The self-expandable metallic endoprosthesis is characterized by its flexibility and elasticity. The authors report the results of 40 femoropopliteal implantations in 36 patients; the follow-up period was greater than 6 months in all patients. Lesion length exceeded 7 cm in 25% of cases and was 3-7 cm in 75%. Thirty percent of lesions were total occlusions. At hemodynamic and angiographic study, two types of complications were noted. In patients not receiving orally administered anticoagulants, six thromboses occurred early; no early thromboses were noted in the nine patients treated with acenocoumarol. Restenosis occurred in 10% of cases (maximum follow-up, 2 years) and was noted even in long lesions (greater than 7 cm). The authors believe that placement of this type of prosthesis is an attractive approach to preventing postangioplasty restenosis, provided that the conditions of anticoagulation are well controlled.\r"

The initial success rate was 100%, without evidence of rupture, thrombosis, dissection, or distal embolization. In only three of the 28 patients who returned for follow-up did symptoms recur or noninvasive vascular laboratory indexes deteriorate (mean follow-up, 25 months). Percutaneous transluminal aortic angioplasty has proved safe and efficacious in the treatment of atherosclerotic aortic stenoses.\r"

Experiments representative of occlusion, restenosis (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis), a good result (less than 50% stenosis), or aneurysm (as defined angiographically) were randomly selected for histologic analysis. Histologic findings were compared with those in untreated control lesions in the contralateral femoral artery. All good results (n = 11) but only four of seven restenoses had histologic evidence of a tear into the tunica media or the tunica adventitia (P = .017). Cases of tears to the adventitia were more likely to have a good result. New myointimal proliferation was more severe with restenosis (P less than .05). Occlusions and aneurysms appeared to be more severe expressions of the histologic findings observed in restenoses and good results, respectively. An arterial tear is necessary but not sufficient to obtain a good result after PTA; outcome is ultimately dependent on the degree of intimal hyperplasia.\r"

Eleven percent of the clots passed through the filter, with all failures limited to the two smallest clot sizes: 4 x 10 mm (five of 25) and 4 x 30 mm (six of 25). The Greenfield filter was 100% efficient in trapping larger clots (8 x 10 mm and 8 x 30 mm). There was a tendency toward poorer clot-trapping performance when the Greenfield filter was tilted within the vena cava, but this was not significant. There were no significant differences in hemodynamic measurements obtained immediately before and after injection of each clot, and no significant changes were noted in the animal's hemodynamic status or in blood gas measurements in those cases in which the clots passed through the filter. Since the caval diameter in sheep approximates that in humans, the authors conclude that the Greenfield filter in the clinical setting is capable of stopping large, likely fatal, emboli and a large number of smaller, possibly less clinically significant, emboli.\r"

  ".U": "89367903\r", 
  ".W": "While both the balloon catheter and the bougie are effective for esophageal dilation, each has its proponents. From a biomechanical point of view, the two methods should differ significantly, since bougienage depends on advancing a tapered dilator to generate radial force and balloon catheter dilation depends solely on balloon inflation to generate its radial dilating force. In a series of equivalent esophageal stenoses made by suture plication in swine esophageal segments, the authors measured shear force and radial force generated by dilation with a Maloney bougie, a Savary-Gilliard bougie, and an esophageal balloon. The mean radial forces generated were 6.42, 4.46, and 4.04 N, respectively, which did not differ significantly. However, the mean shear forces measured were 16.92, 6.92, and 1.44 N, respectively. The shear force with the Maloney bougie differed significantly from that with the Savary-Gilliard and the balloon and was on the same order of magnitude as the tensile strength of the esophagus (25-27 N). The shear force with the balloon was significantly lower than that with either bougie. In theory, the reduced shear force associated with balloon dilation might reduce the risk of esophageal perforation, but safety will have to be determined in clinical trials.\r"

In this in vitro study, agitation greatly expedited the rate of dissolution with MTBE, by far the more potent of the two solvents. An additive effect was suggested when the solvents were used sequentially, monooctanoin followed by MTBE. Cholesterol-calcium stones were also dissolved by MTBE but at a slower rate, depending on the amount and distribution of calcium. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and mammographic images clearly delineated the amount and distribution of calcification, but plain radiographs did not. On the basis of these findings, the authors instituted two changes in their clinical protocol: All patients with gallstones are now examined by means of CT before chemical dissolution begins, and monooctanoin is instilled overnight before the MTBE procedure.\r"

Digital subtraction angiography and standard arteriography showed sensitivities of 92% and 96%, respectively, in the detection of aneurysms. Twenty-three (39%) of the 60 patients had polymicrobial infections. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 50 (83%) of 60 cases; 21 (42%) of the isolates were beta-lactam-resistant strains. Anaerobes and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were observed in 12 (20%) and seven (12%) of 60 patients, respectively. Thirty-six (60%) of the patients were bacteremic. All patients received parenteral antibiotics and had surgical resection of their false aneurysm(s). Bacteriologic treatment failures occurred in five of 13 patients who received less than or equal to 15 days of parenteral antibiotics following surgical ligation, as compared with one of 47 who received longer courses (P = .002). Six of 12 grafting procedures were successful, and six of the 60 patients required amputations. There were no deaths.

The 719 patients had a mean age of 63.2 years; 18% were admitted from nursing homes, and 18% required ventilatory assistance as part of the therapy for pneumonia. Patients with nursing home-acquired pneumonia were significantly older; had a higher mortality (40% vs. 17%); were more likely to be admitted in January; were less likely to complain of cough, fever, anorexia, chills, headache, nausea, sore throat, myalgia, or arthralgia; and were more likely to be confused than those admitted from the community. Pneumonia of unknown etiology and aspiration pneumonia were more common and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection less common among those with nursing home-acquired pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 58% of the 48 cases of bacteremia. None of the bacteremic patients received antibiotics before admission, compared with 34% of the nonbacteremic patients. Aerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia was not more frequent among nursing home patients than among those from the community. The overall mortality was 21% (8.5% for those less than 60 years of age and 28.6% for those greater than 60 years old). By multivariate analysis the following variables were significant predictors of mortality: number of lobes involved by the pneumonic process, number of antibiotics used to treat the pneumonia, age, admission from a nursing home, ventilatory support, and the number of complications that occurred while the patient was in the hospital.\r"

We also compared and controlled for patient characteristics such as age, sex, presence of multiple diagnoses, length of therapy, and concurrent use of other antibiotics. There were no differences in measured clinical outcomes between the two groups. Treatment was successful in 87% of both groups. The average number of febrile days was 5.1 in the first group and 3.9 in the second (P less than .05). Patients on 6-hourly therapy experienced a 12% rate of antibiotic-related adverse effects vs. 5% for the 8-hourly group (P greater than .05). These data support the clinical rationale and safety of a hospitalwide reduction in the frequency of clindamycin dosing. In addition to considerable pharmacy and nursing time saved, this change also saved greater than $40,000 annually in antibiotic costs.\r"

The prevailing evidence so far has suggested that these cells, unlike those in lower vertebrates, adapt little if at all. The experiments on cat rods reported here, however, indicate that this is not really true. Since the cone system in the cat retina has a fairly high light threshold, the rods also need to adapt so that they do not saturate with light before the cones fully take over vision at higher light intensities. In similar experiments, adaptation was found in rods of other mammalian species, including primates.\r"

The activity of many neurons was dictated by the retinal stimulus.

Identify of the proton pump was confirmed by immunoblot of osteoclast membrane proteins probed with antibody to vacuolar H+-ATPase isolated from bovine kidney. The osteoclast's H+-ATPase was immunocytochemically localized to the cell-bone attachment site.

Dibutyryl cAMP triggered a small, transient intestinal fluid accumulation response by 4.5 hours; however, the fluid was completely absorbed by 9 hours. After exposure of intestinal loops to cholera toxin, prostaglandin E was released into the intestinal lumen in a concentration-dependent manner independent of cAMP. Thus, not only cAMP, but also prostaglandins may regulate water and electrolyte secretion in cholera.\r"

Because primates self-administer most of the drugs abused by humans, they can be used to predict the abuse liability of new drugs and for preclinical evaluation of new pharmacotherapies for drug abuse treatment. Daily administration of buprenorphine (an opioid mixed agonist-antagonist) significantly suppressed cocaine self-administration by rhesus monkeys for 30 consecutive days. The effects of buprenorphine were dose-dependent. The suppression of cocaine self-administration by buprenorphine did not reflect a generalized suppression of behavior. These data suggest that buprenorphine would be a useful pharmacotherapy for treatment of cocaine abuse. Because buprenorphine is a safe and effective pharmacotherapy for heroin dependence, buprenorphine treatment may also attenuate dual abuse of cocaine and heroin.\r"

Evidence is provided here for a significant change in the amount and distribution of PKC within the CA1 cell field of the rabbit hippocampus that is specific to learning. This change is seen at 1 day after learning as focal increments of [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate binding to PKC in computer-generated images produced from coronal autoradiographs of rabbit brain. In addition, 3 days after learning, the autoradiographs suggest a redistribution of PKC within CA1 from the cell soma to the dendrites.\r"

A wheat nuclear protein, HBP-1 (histone DNA binding protein-1), which specifically binds to the hexameric motif, has previously been identified as a putative transcription factor. A cDNA clone encoding HBP-1 has been isolated on the basis of specific binding of HBP-1 to the hexameric motif.

In the pyrimidine-Hoogsteen model, a binding size of greater than 15 homopurine base pairs affords greater than 30 discrete sequence-specific hydrogen bonds to duplex DNA. Because pyrimidine oligonucleotides limit triple helix formation to homopurine tracts, it is desirable to determine whether oligonucleotides can be used to bind all four base pairs of DNA. A general solution would allow targeting of oligonucleotides (or their analogs) to any given sequence in the human genome. A study of 20 base triplets reveals that the triple helix can be extended from homopurine to mixed sequences. Guanine contained within a pyrimidine oligonucleotide specifically recognizes thymine.adenine base pairs in duplex DNA. Such specificity allows binding at mixed sites in DNA from simian virus 40 and human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

Mice that had intact copies of the transgenes expressed high levels of correctly initiated human alpha- and beta-globin messenger RNA specifically in erythroid tissue.

In insects, this problem is solved in part by pioneer neurons, which lay down the first axonal pathways when distances are at a minimum. Here the existence of a similar kind of neuron in the developing mammalian telencephalon is described. These are the subplate cells, the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex. Axons from subplate neurons traverse the internal capsule and invade the thalamus early in fetal life, even before the neurons of cortical layers 5 and 6, which will form the adult subcortical projections, are generated. During postnatal life, after the adult pattern of axonal projections is firmly established, most subplate neurons disappear. These observations raise the possibility that the early axonal scaffold formed by subplate cells may prove essential for the establishment of permanent subcortical projections.\r"

The growth cones of these pioneer neurons can migrate while embryonic distances are short and while intervening tissue is relatively uncomplicated. Are these pioneers necessary? In grasshopper embryos, a pair of pioneer neurons arise at the tips of limb buds and extend axons through the limb to the central nervous system. Growth cones of later arising sensory neurons migrate along the pioneer axons. After ingrowth of sensory axons, the pioneer neurons die. If the pioneer neurons are prevented from differentiating by heat shock, then the sensory growth cones that would have migrated along them are blocked and fail to reach the central nervous system. Thus, the pioneer axons are necessary for successful migration of these sensory growth cones. By crossing a segment boundary early in embryogenesis, the pioneers circumvent an incompatibility between differentiated segment boundary cells and growth cone migration. Pioneer neurons may resolve similar problems in many systems.\r"

In the absence of direct functional information, chromosomal map position is a guide for locating the gene. Chromosome walking and jumping and complementary DNA hybridization were used to isolate DNA sequences, encompassing more than 500,000 base pairs, from the cystic fibrosis region on the long arm of human chromosome 7. Several transcribed sequences and conserved segments were identified in this cloned region. One of these corresponds to the cystic fibrosis gene and spans approximately 250,000 base pairs of genomic DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Since the classification of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) into beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes, additional beta-ARs have been implicated in the control of various metabolic processes by catecholamines. A human gene has been isolated that encodes a third beta-AR, here referred to as the \"beta 3-adrenergic receptor.\" Exposure of eukaryotic cells transfected with this gene to adrenaline or noradrenaline promotes the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate; only 2 of 11 classical beta-AR blockers efficiently inhibited this effect, whereas two others behaved as beta 3-AR agonists. The potency order of beta-AR agonists for the beta 3-AR correlates with their rank order for stimulating various metabolic processes in tissues where atypical adrenergic sites are thought to exist. In particular, novel beta-AR agonists having high thermogenic, antiobesity, and antidiabetic activities in animal models are among the most potent stimulators of the beta 3-AR.\r"

Seventy sera (1.2%) from 51 missionaries (1.6%) were ELISA positive; however, on Western blot confirmatory testing none was diagnostic of HIV infection. Twenty-two (43%) of the Western blot tests were read as indeterminate, with band p17 occurring with the greatest frequency (57%), followed by p24 (23%), either alone or in combination. The significance of these equivocal results is unclear, but they do not appear to be a consequence of exposure to either HIV or the related retrovirus HTLV-I. Based on this seroprevalence survey, we conclude that missionary staff and their families were not at high risk of HIV infection between 1967 and 1984, even when serving in regions of high HIV endemicity.\r"

Patients who were admitted for major trauma, for medical emergencies, or in labor were screened. Of 534 sera screened, 11 (2%) were seropositive. All but two of the seropositive patients were men. Rates were similar among black and white patients. Seven patients could be placed into an established risk group, but only one patient was known to have AIDS upon presentation to the emergency room. The mean age of seropositive individuals was 30.9 years; there were similar seroprevalence rates in each of four age groups among men. We conclude that there is a substantial risk of exposure to HIV in trauma and medical emergency centers; therefore all health care workers should practice universal barrier precautions whenever exposure to a patient's blood or body fluids is likely.\r"

Seizures may be manifested by abnormal motor activity, loss of muscle tone, and changes in mental status. Seizure may increase an individual's risk for traumatic injury by adversely influencing performance in a particular situation. We identified 30 patients admitted to our trauma service over a three-year period with injury related to seizure; 16 were male and 14 were female, with a mean age of 34.8 years. Twenty-eight patients (93%) had a history of seizure activity, with the mean duration of seizure activity of 16.5 years (range, three to 40 years). Both seizure diagnosis and etiology were multifactorial. Multiple drug therapy predominated, phenytoin (Dilantin) being the most frequently used medication. Overall compliance was poor (53%). Only blunt injury occurred in these patients, 50% suffering injury from falls. Injuries from motor vehicle accidents (40%) were the next most frequent (auto crash in seven cases, motorcycle crash in four, and bicycle crash in one case). The remainder of the injuries were burns (10%). Nine patients (30%) required operation. Skeletal injuries predominated (67%). Patients with a history of seizure will be frequently encountered by physicians of all specialties. The patients likely to be at increased risk for injury are noncompliant, have breakthrough seizures (ie, despite therapy), or have the metabolism of their seizure medication altered by alcohol or other drugs. To prevent potentially serious injury, these patients should be identified and counseled.\r"

This study was designed to evaluate our progress in dealing with NEC both medically and surgically in a single large neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We also sought to confirm the relation of birth weight and particular indications for operation to outcome. Over 6 1/2 years, there were 7,807 admissions to a large NICU. Though there has been a steady increase in total admissions, especially of infants weighing less than 1,000 gm, survival has improved significantly in all groups (mean 89.1%). NEC occurred in 358 infants (4.6%), and 115 (32%) required surgical intervention. Infants weighing between 751 and 1,000 gm had the highest incidence of NEC. There has been a significant decrease in the mortality of both medically and surgically treated infants with NEC; in both cases, this decrease is weight-dependent. We found that using erythema and edema of the abdominal wall and a fixed-loop roentgenographic pattern as early indicators of necrotic bowel significantly improves survival in surgically treated infants.\r"

The 43 patients (48%) who were hypertensive did not differ significantly from the normotensive patients with regard to age, sex, serum calcium and phosphate levels, and creatinine clearance. However, the mean serum magnesium level was significantly lower in hypertensive hyperparathyroid patients (1.52 +/- 0.24 mEq/L) than in normotensive hyperparathyroid patients (1.76 +/- 0.18 mEq/L; P less than .001), irrespective of use of diuretics in the former group. Although some studies implicate hypomagnesemia in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, we are unaware of any previous human study reporting a link between hypomagnesemia and hypertension associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. This study suggests that a low level of serum magnesium may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, a finding that needs further evaluation.\r"

These findings suggest that CSF lymphocytosis may represent an early phase of infection. A low CSF leukocyte count was associated with a poor outcome, presumably reflecting an inadequate host response to infection. The CSF white cell count increased during the first 24 hours of therapy in 45% of cases. Morbidity and case fatality rates were not significantly increased in this group, suggesting that an initial rise in the CSF leukocyte count does not reflect a poor response to therapy.\r"

Each year, approximately 1,500 and 800 deaths resulted from unintentional injury (UI) and intentional injury (ie, suicide and homicide), respectively. The medical examiner (ME) data differed substantially from the state's vital statistics (VS); over the seven years, the ME records showed 2,021 (16%) fewer UI deaths than did the VS, as well as 24 (1%) more cases of suicide and 499 (23%) more cases of homicide. Rates for UI and suicide were highest for young adults and for the elderly; in contrast, rates for homicide were highest for young adults, and then decreased with age. For each of the three categories of injury-related deaths, rates for male subjects were approximately three times those for female subjects; rates also varied by race-ethnic group. Deaths due to UI and homicide occurred more often in the summer and on weekends, though suicides did not vary by month and were slightly more common on weekdays. This study indicates that ME data represent an important source of epidemiologic information for the surveillance and study of injury-related mortality.\r"

Presence of cellulitis (44 cases) and absence of a popliteal pulse (44 cases) had no significant effect on success of amputation, but a palpable foot pulse was significantly associated with a successful outcome (29/35 cases, or 83%) (P less than .005). Serial amputations to preserve the foot were successful for 18 of 31 extremities (58%), a success rate equal to that of the entire series, 72 of 124 (58%). Attempts to preserve viability in the distal portion of the foot were not associated with mortality. Cellulitis and absence of a distal pulse are not contraindications to attempting preservation of the extremity, although the best results occur when distal extremity pulses are palpable. In nearly six of every ten cases, amputation of the distal portion of the foot resulted in a successful outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Major soft tissue losses of the distal portion of the leg usually require free tissue transfer for reconstruction. We have recently treated seven patients with free rectus abdominis muscle flaps. The rectus abdominis has several advantages over other muscles; these advantages simplify such reconstructions. Elevation of this muscle can be done simultaneously with recipient vessel dissection without the need for patient repositioning. The deep inferior epigastric vessels provide a reliable pedicle of one large artery and two veins of sufficient length to accomplish microvascular anastomosis outside the zone of injury without the use of vein grafts. The size and shape of the muscle conforms well to the defects of many wounds in the leg. There is no functional deficiency from the use of one muscle, and the donor site scar is relatively inconspicuous since the rectus abdominis is harvested through a midline abdominal incision. There have been two complications in this series, one intraoperative flap failure, and one case of recurrent osteomyelitis. There has been no donor site morbidity. We recommend the free rectus abdominis muscle flap for the reconstruction of many complex wounds of the distal portion of the leg.\r"

The most common target population seems to be grades five through nine for both boys and girls. Lack of funding appears to be the largest factor hampering data collection. Although many varied comments and suggestions were received, most called for: 1) new recommendations for screening boys and girls at different grade levels; 2) quantitative referral criteria; 3) improved data gathering: 4) statewide uniformity within programs; and 5) improved understanding within the medical community about indications for referral and the principles of scoliosis treatment.\r"

Ten human cadaver spines were harvested and frozen. The specimens, consisting of segments from T11 to S1, were subjected to torsional loads of up to 20 N-m. Rotation was recorded throughout the loading cycle. The columns of the spine were destroyed at the L2-3 interspace in a predetermined fashion and loading was repeated. The data were plotted as torsion versus rotation in degrees. The curves of each loading cycle were compared and the ratios of the intact and compromised specimens were calculated. The contribution of each column of the spine to torsional rigidity was determined. In an intact lumbar spine, the anulus was the most effective structure in resisting torsion. Experience gained in this study supports the following conclusion: Flexion-distraction injuries of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine involving soft tissue destruction of the anterior column and anulus result in rotational instability.\r"

It is concluded that patients with spine implants may safely undergo magnetic resonance scanning. In Part 2, the magnetic resonance scans from 33 patients (61 studies) then were reviewed to determine which, if any, parameters could be adjusted to minimize artifact. Magnetic power, slice thickness, plane of scan, and pulse sequence were considered. Plane of scan was found to be the most significant parameter in achieving useful studies, with the sagittal plane being the preferred orientation. Scans of patients who had posterior wiring were more likely to be useful, while scans of patients with spinal rods usually showed a large amount of artifact.\r"

In every case of motor paraplegia, SEPs remained unchanged in the presence of abnormal ischiatic/sciatic NMEPs. These results suggest that SEPs are not adequately sensitive to the functional status of the motor system in hogs and humans. Ischiatic/sciatic NMEPs remained unchanged after sensory tract lesioning, suggesting that these NMEPs are insensitive to the functional status of the sensory system. These results suggest that SEPs and NMEPs should be used in combination when monitoring spinal cord function during surgeries that place that structure at risk.\r"

The tcMMEP, recorded bilaterally from anterior tibialis muscles, were evoked by an electric current induced in the motor cortex by a high-intensity transient magnetic field applied to the scalp surface. Potentials were recorded from ten of 12 volunteer subjects and preoperatively in 11 of 11 scoliotic patients. Group mean latency in the volunteers (32.0 +/- 2.1 msec) did not differ from that of the scoliotics (28.6 +/- 5.0 msec), but values in the latter group were more variable. During nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia, tcMMEP with reproducible latencies were obtained in 9 of 11 (82%) cases. A small, but statistically significant, increase in latency occurred during anesthesia. Compared with preoperative values (523 +/- 490 microV), individual tcMMEP amplitudes were significantly decreased intraoperatively (163 +/- 153 microV). Although the absolute amplitudes varied widely, the minimum recorded value was over 20 microV. Thus, intraoperative tcMMEP waveforms were readily discriminable from background electrical noise. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of intraoperative tcMMEP monitoring. Combined somatosensory evoked potential and tcMMEP monitoring may provide a more complete picture of spinal cord function, intraoperatively.\r"

Compound muscle action potential was only minimally changed by the rotation maneuver alone in all five cats. Distraction resulted in earlier deterioration of CMAP than SEP; when CMAP was no longer elicitable in ten cats, seven still showed measurable SEP. All ten cats became paraplegic. With the combined procedure, both CMAP and SEP were abolished earlier than with distraction alone. This was observed in all ten cats becoming paraplegic. The authors further extended the study to ten rabbits having experimentally induced scoliosis. Following corrective surgery with distraction and derotation, eight rabbits lost both CMAP and SEP. Two lost CMAP with still recordable SEP. All ten rabbits became paraplegic. These findings suggest that monitoring CMAP is a more sensitive measure than SEP, and that the spinal cord is more vulnerable to a combined distraction and derotation maneuver than to either one alone.\r"

Group 1, which was used as control, was subjected to lower dorsal bilateral laminectomies with dural incision; Group II to laminectomies with three right posterior rhizotomies; Group III to laminectomies with three right anterior rhizotomies, and Group IV to laminectomies with three right anterior and posterior rhizotomies. Scoliosis was induced in Groups II, III, and IV. There was no significant statistical difference in the degree of curvatures among these three groups. The convexity of the curvature faced to the side of the divided roots. In Groups III and IV, scoliotic curvatures were obvious within 2 weeks, but there were no considerable changes thereafter. In Group II, the curves progressed slowly up to the 12th week. They were statistically significant at the fourth week and increased continuously thereafter. The histologic findings in Groups III and IV showed denervation atrophy of the paravertebral muscles at the apex of the curvature, but there was little or no muscle atrophy in Groups I and II. The experimental results indicate that scoliosis may be induced not only by anterior root paralysis but also by selective posterior root paralysis.\r"

Physiologic integrity of the spinal cord was monitored and recorded by the spinal evoked potentials. With greater traction force, the potentials gradually lessened in amplitude. The vulnerability of the spinal cord to compression force was increased by spinal cord traction. Under 200 g traction, the vulnerability of the lower thoracic cord was most increased. The authors conclude that tethered cord syndrome is caused by the impairment of the spinal cord and lumbosacral roots due to traction, and that spinal cord traction not only causes spinal cord impairment but increases the spinal cord vulnerability to compression.\r"

In vivo determinations of the bone mineral content (BMC) were performed in the radius, femur, and lumbar vertebrae by new noninvasive techniques of single (SPA)- and dual (DPA)-photon absorptiometry. Frequency distributions of scoliosis vs. control subjects with respect to RVD and STI grades showed interdependence to the P less than 0.01 level of significance. The mean BMC determinations of the radius (0.685 +/- 0.061 gm/sq cm) of the femur (0.947 +/- 0.110 gm/BA/sq cm) and of the vertebrae (1.091 +/- 0.105 gm/BA/sq cm) were markedly reduced compared with published control values (P less than 0.001). In comparison with the authors' institutional controls, mean BMC measurements were significantly lower for the radius (P less than 0.05) and for the femur (P less than 0.001). These results conclusively demonstrated that assessment of peak skeletal mass in a population of adult premenopausal women with idiopathic scoliosis showed significant decrease in average BMC measurements compared with control values. Maximal bone accretion was best evaluated at locations unaffected by deformity such as the radial diaphysis and the femoral neck.\r"

In 94% of the affected vertebrae, a distinct anterior elongation of the vertebral centrum was present. This anterior extension was composed of mature cancellous bone and was morphologically and roentgenographically different from marginal osteophyte formation. It was not present in any vertebrae of a control group of 50 unaffected spines. Associated findings included vertebral wedging and Schmorl's nodes.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in spinal instrumentation have brought about a new emphasis on the three-dimensional spinal deformity of scoliosis and especially on the restoration of normal sagittal plane contours. Normal alignment in the coronal and transverse planes is easily defined; however, normal sagittal plane alignment is not so simple. This retrospective study was undertaken to increase the understanding of the normal alignment of the spine in the sagittal plane, with a special emphasis on the thoracolumbar junction. Measurements were made from the lateral radiographs of 102 subjects with clinically and radiographically normal spines. Cobb measurements of the thoracic kyphosis (T3-T12), the thoracolumbar junction (T10-T12 and T12-L2), and the lumbar lordosis (L1-L5) were determined. The spices of the thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis also were determined. Using a computerized digitalizing table, the segmental angulation was determined at each level from T1-2 to L5-S1. In conclusion, there is a wide range of normal sagittal alignment of the thoracic and lumbar spines. When using composite measurements of the combined frontal and sagittal plane deformity of scoliosis, this wide range of sagittal variance should be taken into consideration. Using norms established here for segmental alignment, areas of hypokyphosis and hypolordosis commonly seen in scoliosis can be more objectively evaluated. The thoracolumbar junction is for all practical purposes straight; lumbar lordosis usually starts at L1-2 and gradually increases at each level caudally to the sacrum.\r"

The blood indices in these preoperative patients demonstrated evidence of dilution on both the intracellular and extracellular levels. The major factors causing these dilutional effects were elevated ADH, intravenous fluid overloading, and mobilization of \"third space\" fluids. It appears that extracellular dilution secondary to these factors results in spuriously low blood indices (namely, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells) during the postoperative period. These findings suggest that an awareness of SIADH and avoiding intravenous fluid overloads by accurately managing intraoperative and postoperative fluids will decrease the dilutional effects observed on blood indices and perhaps save patients from unwarranted transfusions.\r"

The nonvascularized grafts, however, showed porosity, fragmentation, and replacement by spongiosa. Mechanical properties showed increased performance in the vascularized vs. nonvascularized grafts, and no improvement was seen between the nonvascularized grafts from 3 to 6 months.\r"

Most Type III curves balanced well regardless of the levels fused. One-third of all patients developed mild radiographic junctional kyphosis at the lower level instrumented, more commonly when instrumentation ended at or above T12. The authors recommend fusing one segment short of the stable vertebra in most Type II curves. Large Type II curves need both curves fused for optimal balance. Type III curves can be fused short of the stable vertebra.\r"

The majority of both the thoracic and the lumbosacral compensatory curves improved postoperatively (average of 38.6 and 66%, respectively). However, when the instrumentation was carried cephalad to the primary curve, there was a high probability that the upper compensatory curve would be worse after the surgery.

  ".W": "The benefits of achieving rigid internal fixation and eliminating the need for postoperative external orthotic support with L-rod spinal instrumentation made it desirable for use in the surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis. From May 1981 to May 1985, 31 severely involved cerebral palsy patients with progressive spinal deformity underwent posterior fusion and L-rod instrumentation. All patients except one were nonambulatory. Surgical indications included prevention of curve progression, correction of pelvic obliquity, and achievement of balanced spinal alignment in order to improve sitting balance and tolerance without external spinal orthotic support. Ten patients (Group I), with an average age of 15.2 years, with double major or flexible paralytic C-curves or scoliosis measuring less than 70 degrees, underwent posterior fusion and L-rod instrumentation only. Twenty-one patients (Group II), with an average age of 22.1 years, with thoracolumbar, lumbar, or rigid paralytic C-curves or scoliosis measuring greater than 70 degrees, underwent initial anterior release, bone grafting, and Zielke instrumentation followed by second-stage L-rod instrumentation. In Group I, scoliosis averaged 57 degrees and postoperatively 27 degrees (53% correction). In Group II, scoliosis averaged 88 degrees and postoperatively 36 degrees (63% correction). Fifteen Group II patients had posterior fusion extend into the sacrum using the Galveston technique. Six Group II patients were not fused into the sacrum. Scoliosis and pelvic obliquity were corrected in both groups. Torso decompensation improved to 2.7 cm in the Galveston group, but increased to 5.6 cm at follow-up in the patients not fused into the sacrum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-seven patients were excluded from this study due to insufficient medical documentation (16), lack of follow-up (5), and death (6); leaving 57 patients in the general study group. Group I (34 patients) had posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with Harrington rod instrumentation (HRI); mean age at surgery was 12 years, average preoperative curve was 57 degrees, average postoperative correction was 42%, with a loss of correction of 9 degrees. The complication rate in this group was 35%. The average follow-up interval was 9 years (range, 4-19 years). Group II (six patients) underwent PSF with Luque segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI); mean age at surgery was 11 years, preoperative curves averaged 37 degrees, average postoperative correction was 42% with a loss of correction of 3 degrees. The complication rate in this group was 16%. Follow-up was 3.5 years. Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluations were done preoperatively and postoperatively at 2- and 5-year intervals. Information was gathered in three categories: 1) ambulation, 2) equipment use, and 3) functional activities. After fusion, sitting tolerance was maintained but additional use of mobile arm supports, lapboards, and reaching aides was necessary for all patients. The ability to perform activities such as drinking, self-feeding, and self-hygiene declined during the 2 years immediately following surgery but improved by 5 years. Surgical patients never approached their preoperative skill levels. Therapy evaluations further demonstrated that there were no difference in function between either operative group.\r"

The purpose of this study is to identify unique aspects of these patients and to understand how spinal fusion affects their function. Forty patients underwent Harrington or Luque rod instrumentation with functional evaluations preoperatively and 2 and 5 years postoperatively. Biomechanical assessment of function is important. Flexibility of the spine is functionally advantageous because distal strength is used to align weaker proximal segments. Postoperatively, lack of spinal flexibility resulted in a decline in gross motor function and increased use of UE aids due to a change in the trunk position in the weaker patients. The stronger patients' activities were maintained. Earlier mobilization in patients with Luque procedures did not improve postoperative function.\r"

All of the patients had operative grading of the splenic injuries according to a prospective protocol. Data on preoperative hypotension (systolic blood pressure of less than 100) and intraoperative splenic bleeding were collected from hospital records. Patients with subcapsular hematomas were excluded. Over-all, 55.4 per cent of the patients with splenic lacerations were hypotensive preoperatively and 76.6 per cent were noted to be bleeding from the spleen at operation. For injuries not involving the hilum, seven of 22 of the patients with Grade I injuries were hypotensive preoperatively versus 19 of 29 of the patients with Grade IV injuries (p = 0.025). Fourteen of 21 patients with Grade I injuries were noted to be bleeding at operation. Seventeen of 23 with Grade IV injuries were noted to be bleeding. This difference was not significant. Of the patients with injuries involving the hilum, 25 of 38 were hypotensive preoperatively and 25 of 29 were noted to be bleeding at operation. No difference in the incidence of hypotension or bleeding was found between superficial and deep hilar injuries. No significant difference was found between the active bleeding with hilar and nonhilar injuries (p = 0.19). For isolated splenic injuries (N = 36), the incidence of hypotension was 39 per cent. However, 79 per cent of the patients with isolated splenic injuries were noted to be bleeding at operation. Of 49 patients with nonisolated splenic injuries who had been hypotensive preoperatively, 72.9 per cent were found to be bleeding at operation. Of the 27 patients never hypotensive preoperatively, 78 per cent were noted to be bleeding at operation (NS). For isolated splenic injury also, no relationship was found between preoperative hypotension and the presence of operative bleeding. No significant correlation was found between preoperative hypotension or the anatomic grade of splenic injury and the incidence of bleeding found at operation. Even if computed tomographic scans can reliably grade splenic injuries, anatomic grade may not be a predictor of clinical behavior. Hypotension also failed to predict the occurrence of continued splenic bleeding.\r"

The management of asymptomatic patients with stab wounds of the chest is controversial. The results of previous reports have asserted that asymptomatic patients with stab wounds of the chest do not have delayed complications develop if roentgenograms of the chest taken six hours after the injury are normal. This \"rule\" has not been validated. A three year, prospective study of patients with stab wounds of the chest was done. Patients were excluded from the study if they had symptoms on arrival, evidence of physiologic derangement caused by intrathoracic injury, wounds near the subclavian vessels or precordial wounds. Patients with lower thoracic stab wounds were evaluated by diagnostic peritoneal lavage. If findings from lavage were negative, the patients were included in the study. One hundred and five patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study group. All of the patients were hospitalized and examined serially. All had roentgenograms of the chest performed at admission, at six hours and at 24 hours. Four patients had a pneumothorax or hemothorax develop between the time of admission and six hours of hospitalization. In the remaining 101 patients, none had a pneumothorax or hemothorax between six and 24 hours. No patient asymptomatic on admission had a tension pneumothorax develop later. No patient had delayed evidence of abdominal injury. An asymptomatic patient with a stab wound of the chest that is not precordial, not in proximity to the subclavian artery and not suspected of diaphragmatic penetration should be serially examined and have a follow-up roentgenogram of the chest at six hours. If the patient remains asymptomatic and the six hour film is normal, delayed complications are rarely, if ever, encountered and the patient does not require further studies or hospitalization. The six hour rule for stab wounds of the chest is valid.\r"

Of those patients with metastases to the omentum, the clinical impression did not correlate with pathologic findings in 45 per cent. The findings were similar for diaphragmatic lymph nodes (50 per cent), pelvic lymph nodes (71 per cent) and para-aortic lymph nodes (96 per cent). Nine of 97 patients clinically thought to have stage I disease had the stage elevated to II and III based on pathologic findings.

Surgical exploration for early stage carcinoma of the ovary should include biopsy of the retroperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, excision of the infracolic omentum, biopsies of pelvic and abdominal peritoneum, including the right diaphragm, and peritoneal cytologic studies.\r"

The urethral meatus was in the subcoronal position in six boys, the distal shaft position in one boy and on the corona glandis in two boys. Although it is generally thought that boys with hypospadias have a dorsal hooded prepuce resulting from incomplete development of the ventral phallus, we have found hypospadias in boys with complete preputial development. Thus, physicians who perform circumcision should fully retract the prepuce to detect occult hypospadias before completing the procedure. Parents of newborns with hypospadias and a complete prepuce should be told, before circumcision, that preputial tissues may be needed to repair the hypospadias.\r"

In our experience, 46 of 51 patients with massively enlarged spleens had a myeloproliferative disorder (leukemia, lymphoma or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) and usually had a limited life expectancy. When morbidity in these patients was compared with that in patients with the same diagnosis but spleens of smaller size, no increase in complications or death was found other than a greater operative blood loss in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Limitation of operative morbidity in patients with very large spleens depends on careful selection and appropriate operative and perioperative management.\r"

Nine had experienced either postmenopausal bleeding or uterine instrumentation, or both, within the prior six months. Findings from physical examination and various laboratory and roentgenologic studies did not significantly help in improving the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis. In four, the abscess was associated with intra-abdominal pathologic conditions, and six had poorly controlled adult onset diabetes mellitus. Transfusion was required in eight patients. Two patients had a prolonged hospital stay because of pulmonary and septic complications. One patient had carcinoma of the ovary while another had carcinoma of the cervix uteri that was undiagnosed preoperatively. Our conclusion is that about one-half of postmenopausal patients with pelvic and tubo-ovarian abscesses have postmenopausal bleeding. The remainder may have associated intra-abdominal infective pathologic findings or a malignant condition of the genital tract. Expeditious surgical treatment should be undertaken.\r"

Of 244 patients with traumatic intracerebral hematomas, 85 were selected for intracranial pressure monitoring to assist in deciding whether surgical evacuation was indicated. None had deteriorated in conscious level or developed new neurological deficit since injury. Fifty-five patients (65%) demonstrated high intracranial pressure and underwent craniotomy. In 30 patients, intracranial pressure remained under 30 mm Hg, and their hematomas were not initially removed. Five of these 30 patients suddenly deteriorated or died 6 to 11 days after injury, with features of high intracranial pressure clinically or at postmortem. Intracranial pressure monitoring therefore failed to predict a late rise in intracranial pressure in 16.6% of those with low intracranial pressure initially. An analysis of computed tomography scanning and clinical features was therefore carried out to search for better predictors of the need for surgery. Our data suggest that basal cistern status, coma score, and the severity of edema surrounding the intracerebral hematoma should be used, in addition to intracranial pressure monitoring, to improve management of patients with traumatic intracerebral hematoma.\r"

Thirty minutes after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the concentration of 3H-nicardipine was higher in the ventricles and in the subarachnoid space than that found in normal brains. It is concluded that nicardipine penetrates into the subarachnoid spaces and ventricles from pial vessels and/or choroid plexus, and that subarachnoid hemorrhage increases the penetration of nicardipine from vessels into the subarachnoid space.\r"

The initial operations of 62 patients were converted to a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, 11 to an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, and 47 to a vertical banded gastroplasty. Four patients are dead (three of unrelated causes), 11 have undergone a third operation for morbid obesity, and five (4.2%) are lost to follow-up. For 69 of 86 patients, 3- to 5-year follow-up data are available. Serious early complications occurred in 5.8% of the patients. Almost 80% of the patients who received an unbanded gastrogastroplasty did not control their weight, whereas most of those who received a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy or a vertical banded gastroplasty had satisfactory long-term weight control 3 to 5 years later, maintaining an average weight loss of 30% of their original weight or 55% of their excess weight. Conversion surgery is safe and effective.\r"

Of the remaining 145 patients with equivocal findings, 27% had an upper gastrointestinal series, 29% a barium enema, and 44% had both. Useful information (complete obstruction, unobstructed passage of contrast, or diagnosis other than adhesional obstruction) was obtained from 86% of the radiographic studies. Three patients had negative contrast studies yet eventually underwent adhesiolysis (enterolysis) and were classified as false-negative. Two patients had evidence of high-grade obstruction yet had nonoperative resolution and were classified as false-positive. The mortality in the contrast group (7%) was not statistically different than that in the no-contrast group (7%).

Plasma CCK concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, and gallbladder contraction, measured by cholescintigraphy, were studied after intestinal administration of fat. Fasting plasma CCK concentrations were in the same range in nine patients who had undergone Billroth I gastrectomy (1.0 +/- 0.2 pmol/L), in nine patients who had undergone Billroth II gastrectomy (1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol/L), and in nine normal subjects (1.5 +/- 0.4 pmol/L). The peak increments in plasma CCK after intestinal fat were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in patients with partial gastrectomy (5.4 +/- 0.6 pmol/L) compared with normal subjects (7.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/L). The integrated plasma CCK secretion was significantly (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.05) reduced during the first 30 minutes in patients after Billroth I (74 +/- 11 pmol/1.30 min) and Billroth II gastrectomy (51 +/- 11 pmol/1.30 min) compared with normal subjects (122 +/- 18 pmol/1.30 min). Similarly, the start of gallbladder emptying was significantly (p less than 0.05) delayed in patients after partial gastrectomy. After 1 hour, however, the integrated plasma CCK response and gallbladder emptying were in the same range in Billroth I patients (186 +/- 34 pmol/1.60 min, 60% +/- 7%), Billroth II patients (175 +/- 17 pmol/1.60 min, 63% +/- 7%) and normal subjects (190 +/- 18 pmol/1.60 min, 55% +/- 6%). It is concluded that in patients who have undergone partial gastrectomy plasma CCK and gallbladder responses to intestinal fat are significantly delayed but reach normal levels beyond 30 minutes.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that neutrophils are an important factor in the organ injury associated with ischemia and shock. Increased neutrophil-endothelial adhesiveness is essential for neutrophil-mediated vascular injury. To examine the role of neutrophils and neutrophil adhesiveness in the development of injury after hypovolemic shock, and to determine whether this injury is a consequence of reperfusion, we used the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 60.3 (directed to the primary human neutrophil adherence glycoprotein, CD18) to block neutrophil adherence functions at the time of resuscitation in a rabbit model of hemorrhagic shock. None of the unanesthetized control animals subjected to 2 hours of shock (cardiac output, 30% of baseline) followed by resuscitation survived 5 days. All had gross and histologic evidence of injury to lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal mucosa. In contrast, 71% of the animals that received MAb 60.3 immediately before resuscitation survived 5 days (p less than 0.005), and visceral organ injury was absent or markedly attenuated. We conclude that a significant proportion of injury resulting from shock and resuscitation occurs after the ischemic insult and that increased neutrophil adhesiveness plays an important role in the development of multiple organ injury and death following shock and resuscitation (in this model). This injury may be significantly reduced by blocking neutrophil adherence functions with the MAb 60.3--even if administration is delayed until resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of extracellular calcium on the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+i) were studied by dual-wavelength microfluorometry in individual human parathyroid cells obtained from adenomatous glands and normal-sized glands associated with adenomas in hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as from enlarged glands of patients with uremia with HPT. In comparison with the normal parathyroid tissue, chief cells of the adenomatous and hyperplastic glands showed significantly lower Ca2+, and also right-shifted responses of Ca2+i to increases in the extracellular calcium concentration within the 0.5 to 3.0 mmol/L range. This pathophysiologic disturbance apparently was independent of the cell size. Oxyphil cells of nodules from the hyperplastic glands had lower Ca2+i and responded less to increments in extracellular Ca2+ than the chief cells from the surrounding parts of the same glands. Also the chief cells from the normal-sized glands associated with single adenomas exhibited a disturbance of the regulation of Ca2+i, which was less pronounced than that in the cells of the adenomas. These findings support the presence of relative calcium insensitivity of Ca2+i in chief and oxyphil parathyroid cells from adenomatous and hyperplastic glands. This derangement may also be found in all parathyroid glands of individuals with adenomatous HPT.\r"

  ".W": "Failure of a primary surgical treatment for cancer is often caused by recurrence of the tumor at the surgical site. The KHT mouse tumor system recapitulates this experience and provides a useful model to test strategies for reducing the incidence of local recurrence after surgical excision. There was an 82% local recurrence of the KHT tumor after surgery. A cell dilution assay indicated that it would require only 39 tumor cells injected into the wound site to result in the same (82%) incidence of tumors. This figure is in contrast to 340 cells required when the cells were injected into an unwounded flank. With the B16 melanoma in C57B1 mice and the Meth A sarcoma in BALB/c mice, the number of cells necessary to induce a tumor (TD/50) was also significantly reduced when the cells were injected into a surgical wound rather than into nonwounded tissue. The difference in cell number was interpreted as the result of the presence of growth factors derived from the traumatized tissue and the inflammatory cells at the wound site. Neither a 5 nor a 15 Gy dose of x-radiation delivered to the wound site immediately after surgical excision of the KHT tumor resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of local recurrences. When the same doses of x-radiation were given immediately after injecting 36 KHT cells into a wound, no tumors developed. This difference was believed to have resulted from the hypoxic condition in the wound site and the presence of residual clonogenic tumor cells in a nonproliferating (radioresistant) state.\r"

Although relief of symptoms has been reported, this has not always been associated with changes in esophageal contraction pressures or luminal pH. Myoischemia has been proposed as one possible mechanism for esophageal chest pain. We have investigated the effect of the calcium channel blockers verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem on esophageal blood flow in the rabbit model. Esophageal blood flow was measured three times in each rabbit with use of the radiolabeled microsphere technique after a 30-minute continuous infusion of (1) saline solution (baseline), (2) a low dose, and (3) a high dose of each agent. Esophageal mucosal blood flow significantly decreased with nifedipine but was unchanged with verapamil and diltiazem. Esophageal muscle blood flow significantly increased--approximately 100% after administration of each of the calcium channel blockers. Thus esophageal muscle blood flow is enhanced after administration of calcium channel blockers, and this may be one therapeutic mechanism of the calcium channel blockers in the relief of esophageal chest pain in some esophageal diseases.\r"

This makes it particularly suitable for use in light guiding systems. In this study laser light scattering spectroscopy was assessed for its ability to provide information on the motility of respiratory cilia. In vitro and in vivo measurements were undertaken with animal tracheal mucosa. The intensity fluctuations of laser light scattered from moving cilia were analysed in terms of their autocorrelation functions to provide information on the frequency and synchrony of beating cilia. In vitro measurements were performed on fresh bovine trachea to estimate a safe laser power level for mucosal exposure and to test the method by defining the temperature dependence of the ciliary beat frequency. Power densities not exceeding 0.3 kW/cm2 were found to be the upper limit for long term exposure of the mucosa in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency showed a pronounced temperature dependence, ranging from 5.8 to 28.3 Hz over the temperature range 20-43.5 degrees C. A maximum frequency was found at 41.5 degrees C. In vivo measurements of ciliary activity were performed in six pigs by means of optical fibres for light transmission combined with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. A ciliary beat frequency of 5 Hz was obtained; heart and breathing frequencies could be separated and identified. These results suggest that laser light scattering spectroscopy might provide a convenient method of studying the mucociliary system of the lower airways.\r"

Thirteen patients with mild idiopathic scoliosis were studied with and without the corrective brace applied. Lung volumes and the pattern of chest wall and abdominal movement were measured during quiet breathing. Transdiaphragmatic pressures were measured in six of the patients and upper ribcage movement in seven patients. Application of the brace resulted in a significant reduction in vital capacity (14%), functional residual capacity (22%), and total lung capacity (12%). There was no effect on respiratory rate or minute volume. In the erect position the pattern of chest wall movement was altered with a reduction in lower ribcage movement of 46% and abdominal wall of 39% and an increase in upper ribcage movement of 43%. These changes were greater in the supine position. There was at least a twofold increase in end inspiratory and end expiratory gastric pressures during tidal breathing, but oesophageal pressures were not affected by the brace. Transdiaphragmatic pressures showed a similar twofold increase, which implies a substantial increase in the work of breathing. In view of the doubts concerning the influence of bracing on the natural history of idiopathic scoliosis and the substantial functional effect of bracing on the respiratory system, it is suggested that the current practice of bracing in this condition needs to be reviewed.\r"

Peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured immediately before and after the four hours and over the subsequent hour. There was no significant difference between the erect and supine posture for PEF (248 v 248 l/min), FEV1 (1.31 v 1.22 l), or FVC (2.34 v 2.28 l) at the end of the four hours, nor did any significant change develop subsequently. Thus the supine posture is not associated with prolonged bronchoconstriction. As each patient had previously shown an average overnight fall in PEF of more than 20%, this study strongly suggests that the supine posture is not an important cause of overnight bronchoconstriction.\r"

The two challenges were performed in random order with an interval of 14 days. A normal diurnal decrease in serum cortisol concentrations was observed on both days. Mean blood cortisol concentrations three hours after inhalation of allergen (before the late response), nine hours afterwards (at the time of the late response), and 24 hours afterwards were virtually identical to those observed after inhalation of phosphate buffered saline. Serum cortisol concentrations before challenge and three, nine, and 24 hours after challenge were not related to the diurnal increase in blood eosinophils on the control day, or to the size of the late asthmatic response or accompanying changes in blood eosinophils after allergen challenge. It is concluded that serum cortisol concentrations show normal diurnal variation after allergen challenge and are unrelated to the size of the late response or associated changes in blood eosinophil counts.\r"

The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks in 87 (43.5%) and stroke in 36 (18%) patients; 77 patients (38.5%) were asymptomatic. In 176 sides (88%), the degree of stenosis exceeded 50% in terms of diameter reduction. The perioperative stroke rate was 2.3% in patients with transient ischemic attacks, 2.8% in patients with strokes, and 1.3% in asymptomatic patients. There was one perioperative death (0.5%). There were five occlusions of the internal carotid artery, one during the perioperative period and four after discharge; in three patients the occlusion was associated with the development of a stroke. There was a restenosis rate of 19.7% secondary to myointimal hyperplasia; such lesions did not appear to contribute to new ischemic events during or after their development. The mean stroke incidence after the decision was made for carotid endarterectomy was 2.8%/yr in the patients with transient ischemic attacks, 6.2%/yr in the patients with stroke, and 0.65%/yr in the asymptomatic patients. The annual death rate was 6% for the entire group, 5.5%/yr in the patients with transient ischemic attacks, 9.2%/yr in the patients with stroke, and 4.6%/yr in the asymptomatic patients.\r"

None was correctly diagnosed on the death certificates, and four of the nine (44%) were misdiagnosed as intracerebral hemorrhage. We found the survival rate of patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage to be much lower than previously reported because we detected a large number of sudden deaths due to subarachnoid hemorrhage through the high rate of autopsy in our cohort (81.4%).\r"

Electrocardiographic changes were related to the initial level of consciousness, to subsequent events, and to outcome after 3 months. All 61 patients had at least one abnormal electrocardiogram, but cardiac disease did not contribute directly to morbidity or mortality. Fast rhythm disturbances, ischemic changes, or both on the electrocardiograms were significantly correlated with poor outcome but not with specific outcome events, particularly not with rebleeding or cerebral ischemia. The Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission and the amount of cisternal and (to a lesser extent) intraventricular blood on the initial computed tomogram were also significantly correlated with poor outcome, but these factors only partially confounded the relation between electrocardiographic abnormalities and poor outcome. We conclude that in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, electrocardiographic abnormalities do not herald impending cardiac disease but indirectly reflect adverse intracranial factors. Electrocardiographic abnormalities may therefore have some independent value in predicting poor outcome.\r"

Twenty-three of the 25 operated patients were seen in long-term follow-up; 19 (83%) were found to have a patent operated vessel by noninvasive testing. None of the 23 operated patients followed up suffered recurrent neurologic deficits following surgery; two had distant contralateral strokes. Three of the nine patients treated medically (33%) experienced delayed ipsilateral stroke.

Cerebral blood flow was also determined according to the autoradiographic technique with a bolus injection of [15O]water. There were reasonable overall correlations between dynamic [15O]water and [18F]fluoromethane values for cerebral blood flow (r = 0.82) and between dynamic and autoradiographic [15O]water values for cerebral blood flow (r = 0.83). We found a close correspondence between abnormal pathologic findings and visually evaluated cerebral blood flow tomograms obtained with the two tracers. On average, dynamic [15O]water cerebral blood flow was 6% lower than that measured with [18F]fluoromethane. There also was a general trend toward a greater underestimation with [15O]water in high-flow areas, particularly in hyperemic areas, probably due to incomplete first-pass extraction of [15O]water. Underestimation was not detected in low-flow areas or in the cerebellum. Absolute cerebral blood flow values were less closely correlated between tracers and techniques than cerebral blood flow patterns. The variability of the relation between absolute flow values was probably caused by confounding effects of the variation in the circulatory delay time. The autoradiographic technique was most sensitive to this type error.\r"

Examinations were performed using the xenon-133 inhalation technique, and the data were processed and displayed by a computer-assisted system of our own design that allows statistical analysis in real time and is suitable for clinical use. The consistency of lateralization correlated with computed tomographic findings was tested for absolute values, percent distribution, and asymmetries. The latter yielded the highest degree of sensitivity (in 83.3% of the patients the affected hemisphere was correctly identified). Absolute values showed at least one hypoperfused area in the affected hemisphere in 48.7% of the patients, and percent distribution did so in 57.7%. Furthermore, the combination of the three methods of data analysis yielded a sensitivity of 91%; the remaining 9% of the patients, however, exhibited some abnormalities of regional cerebral blood flow (bilateral or contralateral hypoperfusion). Although good agreement was found for lateralization by computed tomography and by the combined use of the three methods of analysis, a complete overlap between functional and structural examinations should not be expected. Problems concerning the sensitivity of the xenon-133 inhalation technique under conditions of low blood flow and the statistical analysis of regional cerebral blood flow data are discussed.\r"

TOPOSCOUT is capable of detecting typical stroke patterns, for example, \"top-of-the-basilar\" or Wallenberg's syndromes. The accuracy of TOPOSCOUT's diagnoses has been tested for conformity with the final diagnoses of 129 patients in the Hamburg Stroke Data Bank, and a high level of agreement was found for hemispheric lesions. The program runs on microcomputers with MS-DOS and is intended as a practical aid for physicians not fully familiar with topologic stroke diagnosis and as an interactive teaching device.\r"

Nineteen spSHR fed the diet containing 4% NaCl and 0.75% K+ (low-K+ diet) from weaning had an accelerated rate of stroke development (mean +/- SEM age at death 15.3 +/- 0.5 weeks). The same diet containing 2.11% K+ (high-K+ diet) increased the mean lifespan of 15 spSHR by 39% but did not prevent stroke. The locations of hemorrhagic lesions were similar in the groups of spSHR fed high- and low-K+ diets, being nearly equally divided between the territories of the anterior, posterior, and middle cerebral arteries. The 14 srSHR fed the low-K+ diet exhibited 50% mortality at 66 weeks of age. However, in the srSHR fed the low-K+ diet, death did not result from hemorrhagic stroke. The differing incidence of stroke between the spSHR fed high- and low-K+ diets and between spSHR and srSHR fed the low-K+ diet could not be explained on the basis of differing blood pressures. Compared with spSHR fed the low-K+ diet, both srSHR fed the low-K+ diet and spSHR fed the high-K+ diet exhibited higher drinking and urine excretion rates and elevated plasma K+ levels. My study indicates the availability of a commercial North American diet that produces a predictable high incidence of stroke within a compressed time period in spSHR but not in srSHR. This diet would be useful in studies attempting to determine the events preceding and leading to the development of stroke and in determining the genetic factors responsible for stroke resistance.\r"

Adult male albino mice (Mus musculus) weighing 25-30 g were subjected to three pretreatment hypoxic exposures (4.5% O2, balance N2) of increasing duration (90, 120, and 150 seconds) with 300 seconds of normoxia between each pretreatment exposure and before testing of hypoxic survival time. Acute pretreatment exposures to hypoxia significantly increased mean +/- SEM hypoxic survival time from 108 +/- 4 to 403 +/- 42 seconds. Mean +/- SEM blood glucose concentrations increased significantly from 201 +/- 19 to 397 +/- 10 mg/dl immediately after hypoxic pretreatment. A significant increase in mean +/- SEM blood ketone concentrations, from 0.15 +/- 0.01 to 0.40 +/- 0.08 mM, was detected in the blood 1,800 seconds but not 300 seconds after hypoxic pretreatment. However, pretreatment with exogenous glucose or ketones alone, to mimic the blood levels seen after hypoxic pretreatment, failed to increase hypoxic survival time. In contrast, mice pretreated with hypoxic exposures plus the exogenous substrate beta-hydroxybutyrate had an increased mean +/- SEM hypoxic survival time of 749 +/- 48 seconds and a decreased body temperature. Stepwise Cox regression analyses with body temperature as a fixed covariate suggest that this decrease in body temperature has a partial role in, but can not fully account for, the increased hypoxic survival time. These data suggest that sequential exposures to hypoxia induce metabolic changes that protect against the lethal effects of hypoxia, perhaps by altering substrate mobilization and utilization and/or by inducing a hypometabolic hypothermia.\r"

We analyzed the mechanisms of change in glucose utilization outside the infarct using Fink-Heimer silver impregnation, axonal transport of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated-horseradish peroxidase, and succinate dehydrogenase histochemistry. One day after occlusion, glucose utilization was remarkably reduced in the areas surrounding the infarct. There were many silver grains indicating degeneration of the synaptic terminals in the cortical areas surrounding the infarct and the ipsilateral cingulate cortex. Moreover, in the left thalamus where the left middle cerebral artery supplied no blood, glucose utilization significantly decreased compared with sham-operated rats. In the left thalamus, massive silver staining of degenerated synaptic terminals and decreases in succinate dehydrogenase activity were observed 4 and 5 days after occlusion. The absence of succinate dehydrogenase staining may reflect early changes in retrograde degeneration of thalamic neurons after ischemic injury of the thalamocortical pathway. Terminal degeneration even affected areas remote from the infarct: there were silver grains in the contralateral hemisphere transcallosally connected to the infarct and in the ipsilateral substantia nigra. Axonal transport study showed disruption of the corticospinal tract by subcortical ischemia; the transcallosal pathways in the cortex surrounding the infarct were preserved. The relation between neural function and the neuronal network in the area surrounding the focal cerebral infarct is discussed with regard to ischemic penumbra and diaschisis.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique using platinum-iridium electrodes placed within the parietal cortex. Ten rabbits were infused with 50 mg/kg poloxamer 188 in saline beginning 30 minutes after occlusion; 12 control rabbits received an equal volume of saline. Poloxamer 188 increased blood flow significantly in areas of severe or moderate ischemia but had little effect in areas with mild or no ischemia. The improvement in blood flow could not be accounted for by hemodilution, and the copolymer did not affect blood viscosity at any shear rate from 1 to 100 sec-1. We hypothesize that poloxamer 188 increases circulation in ischemic tissue by inhibiting adhesive interactions among proteins (fibrin and fibrinogen) and cells in the microcirculation.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium derived from the blood is known to accumulate in brain tissue during the early stages of incomplete ischemia. Our present studies were undertaken to determine the relation between blood-brain barrier sodium transport and the development of ischemic brain edema. Incomplete cerebral ischemia was produced in gerbils by ligation of the left common carotid artery under ether anesthesia. Following recovery from the anesthetic, the gerbis were evaluated for the presence of neurologic symptoms and were divided into symptomatic (n = 77) and asymptomatic (n = 94) groups. Tissue water, sodium, and potassium contents, tissue plasma volume, and brain uptake of 22Na were measured in both groups 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after carotid ligation. There was a progressive accumulation of sodium and water in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex of the symptomatic group compared with either the corresponding contralateral cortex of the same gerbils or with the asymptomatic group. Net changes in brain sodium and potassium concentrations appeared to be the main determinants of fluid accumulation. Brain edema was not due to opening of the blood-brain barrier because the unidirectional transport of 22Na remained low and was even reduced by 35-55% in the ischemic cortex. Nevertheless, this sodium transport activity appeared to be rate-limiting in the development of brain edema during the first 3 hours of ischemia because the rate of sodium accumulation in the tissue was the same as the rate of 22Na transport from the blood to the brain. We conclude that blood-brain barrier sodium transport is an important factor in the formation of ischemic brain edema.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of Lyme disease is rapidly increasing in the United States. To assess the potential of transmission of the disease through blood transfusion, we studied the survival of Borrelia burgdorferi in blood products under blood bank storage conditions. Two units of whole blood, separated into red cells (RBCs), fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet concentrates (PCs), were inoculated with B. burgdorferi (strain B31) in concentrations of approximately 3000 organisms per mL of RBCs and FFP and 200 organisms per mL of PCs. Products were then stored under blood banking conditions and sampled at several storage times. The viability of the spirochete in blood components was determined by darkfield microscopic examination of cultures in modified Kelly's medium. The organism was shown to survive in RBCs (4 degrees C) and FFP (below -18 degrees C) for 45 days and in PCs (20-24 degrees C) for 6 days. The results of this study do not exclude the possibility of transmission of Lyme disease through blood transfusion.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the technical and behavioral impact of predonation alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing, one group of 2914 donors (Reflotron group) were tested with the Boehringer Mannheim Reflotron instrument; 3042 control group donors had no predonation test. Mobile blood collection sites in three regional blood centers were studied. More Reflotron group donors than control group donors thought that predonation testing did not add time and was a good idea. Both groups were equally satisfied with the donation process and indicated they would donate again even if testing added time. Comparison of the Reflotron and standard laboratory tests showed excellent correlation with low variability. The mean r value was 0.934, with a mean sensitivity of 94.4 percent and a specificity of 99.8 percent. The staff working with the Reflotron group found predonation testing easy to incorporate into donor screening. They observed that donors were pleased with testing and accepting of deferral counseling for elevated ALT. The control group staff was concerned that predonation testing would require more time and would have a negative effect on the donor return rate. This did not appear to be the case as judged by donor response and the 6-month return rates of 50 percent for Reflotron group and 54 percent for control group donors.\r"

Platelet yield in BC-PCs and PRP-PCs was 59 and 75 percent of donated platelets, respectively. The number of total white cells in 1 BC-PC unit, prepared from a pool of 7 buffy coats, was 21 x 10(6), i.e., 50 times lower than that of 7 units of PRP-PCs. The in vitro values of adequate platelet quality were maintained for 10 days in BC-PCs stored in 1000-mL polyolefin bags. Prolonged bleeding times were reduced or corrected in three of three thrombocytopenic leukemic patients evaluated before and after transfusion of stored BC-PCs. Pretransfusion and 1- and 24-hour posttransfusion median platelet counts in 57 leukemic recipients during 4 months of routine transfusion of BC-PCs (n = 93) were 14, 35, and 27 x 10(9) per L, while those of PRP-PCs (n = 246) were 13, 37, and 31 x 10(9) per L, respectively. No reactions to BC-PCs were reported, but a 1.3 percent rate of reaction to PRP-PC transfusions was reported. This study indicates that BC-PCs are a good alternative to PRP-PCs for platelet support of thrombocytopenic patients.\r"

With a mathematical model, the risk was derived of such transfusions causing hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in subsequent pregnancies. Calculations were performed for six classes of relatives of the recipient and her husband and for four racial groups. In general, the risk of HDN increases with the donor's degree of relatedness to the husband and decreases with the donor's degree of relatedness to the recipient in a fairly continuous manner. The relative risk for subsequent HDN was as high as 4.1 if the husband donated. The risk varied with the recipient's race as well as Rh(D) status. Although small, the risk involved in transfusing a woman of childbearing age with blood from her husband or his relatives should be considered when using directed donors.\r"

The authors examined the in vitro and in vivo function of platelets collected on the Haemonetics AutoSurge machine and stored for 5 days in two separate 1000-mL CLX bags. The average count per bag was 1.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(11) in approximately 200 mL of plasma. Immediately following collection, the platelet response to ADP and epinephrine represented 78 and 35 percent, respectively, of the preapheresis values. Aggregation to single stimuli subsequently decreased to 29 and 0 percent, respectively by Day 5. This response is equal to or better than the response reported with the Fenwal CS-3000, the only other plateletpheresis device routinely used for long-term storage. The pH of the preparations was well maintained throughout storage, and there was little alteration in hypotonic shock response or serotonin uptake. Serotonin release decreased consistently. The morphology scores indicated good maintenance of shape immediately following collection; this subsequently decreased after 5 days of storage. Bacterial cultures were negative in all instances. The 51Cr in vivo survival and recovery was good with 65.5 +/- 7.1 percent recovery and an average survival of 7.3 +/- 1.3 days (multiple hit; n = 5). The data indicate that storage of the Haemonetics plateletpheresis product is feasible and that the product is as good as others currently available.\r"

More recently, a high incidence of Th activation in congenital hypoplastic anemia has been reported, along with the finding that 13.5 percent of cord bloods are Th activated. The incidence of Th reactivity in newborn infants was confirmed by studying 200 paired samples of maternal and cord blood. Twenty-two (11%) of the cord samples and 13 (6.5%) of the maternal samples were Th activated. In 6 paired samples (6/22), both the mother and child had Th activation, a finding that demonstrates a high degree of concordance. Additionally, 3 (6%) of 50 pregnant women were Th positive. These findings indicate that Th activation is another of the red cell antigen alterations related to pregnancy.\r"

Serologic studies of the patient's serum revealed suprofen-dependent red cell antibodies. However, tolmetin-dependent antibodies were also found in the serum, showing the same properties as the suprofen antibodies and an even higher titer. The patient not only had drug-dependent antibodies in the serum, but also had developed autoantibodies, a phenomenon that has been described for several other drugs. The working mechanism by which suprofen and tolmetin caused immune hemolysis had properties of both the immune complex model and the induction of autoimmunity. Although it was unclear whether the immune hemolytic anemia was the result of suprofen, tolmetin, or cross-reacting antibodies, we feel that suprofen should be added to the list of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs associated with a positive direct antiglobulin test.\r"

Kell antigen activity could not be detected by flow cytometric analysis and was demonstrable only by sensitive serologic techniques. As with normal-strength Kell antigens, reactivity could be abolished by treatment with 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET). The donor's red cells have Kx antigen activity. Other commonly tested blood group antigens (MNSs, Rh, P1, Lewis, Duffy, and Kidd systems) appear normal. Clinical and serologic examination showed that this case is different from previously described examples of modified Kell expression. The propositus's phenotype has remained unchanged for 19 months, which suggests that it is not a transient condition. However, family studies provide no evidence that it is inherited. A 93-kD protein, which reacted weakly by Western blot with rabbit antibody to Kell protein, was isolated from the propositus's red cells by immunoprecipitation. This finding was not reproduced in subsequent studies, which suggests that the quantity of Kell protein recovered was at the threshold level detectable by the technique used. The red cell phenotype is categorized as Kmod, of which this is the first example reported in a healthy individual.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte-depleted blood products are being used with increasing frequency in hopes of preventing or delaying platelet alloimmunization. However, accurately monitoring the efficiency of leukocyte (WBC) removal is a difficult problem because electronic cell counters are not accurate at very low WBC numbers and hemocytometer counts are tedious and time consuming. A simple flow cytometric technique was developed which accurately and rapidly measures extremely low WBC counts. Using a propidium iodide solution which causes DNA to fluoresce, the residual WBC count was measured in 42 units of blood products after leukocyte depletion using a commercial filter. There was a significant correlation with simultaneous hemocytometer counts, r = 0.672, but residual WBC could be identified in every unit using the flow cytometer, whereas in 19% of the units no WBC were seen using the hemocytometer. Extremely low counts, as low as a single WBC/4 microliters could be reproducibly obtained. In addition, serial dilution studies yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.997. Because most clinical laboratories now have access to flow cytometers, this technique can be widely used.\r"

  ".U": "89371253\r", 
  ".W": "31P MR spectroscopic studies of forearm exercise frequently assume that the volume sampled is appropriate for the muscle of interest and that individual variations in muscle anatomy and use are not important. Postexercise MR imaging was used to assess variations in the size, location, and use of forearm flexors and the accuracy of palpation as a method for locating the muscle of interest. By using the information obtained with MR, the effects of errors in surface-coil position relative to the muscle of interest on 31P MR spectroscopy were examined. In the midforearm of seven men, the greatest diameter of the flexor carpi ulnaris was 29 +/- 4 mm, and that of the flexor digitorum superficialis was 28 +/- 6 mm. However, in the proximal forearm, 58 +/- 10% of the diameter was covered by the palmaris longus, when present (79% of subjects). An unexpected finding was that a focal portion of the superficial finger flexor was used primarily as a wrist flexor in 26% of subjects. Palpation incorrectly identified flexor muscle margins by more than 15 mm in 50% of attempts. When a surface coil was positioned over wrist flexors during handgrip, attenuation of exercise-induced changes in 31P spectra resulted. Exercise-enhanced MR imaging reveals variations in forearm muscle anatomy and use that are common and difficult to appreciate by palpation. It therefore allows improved localization of the sensitive volume for MR spectroscopic studies of muscle physiology.\r"

Scans were made by using a spin-echo pulse sequence before and after IV administration of 0.15 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. The images were made at four intervals (average of 5, 12, 30, and 90 days) after the onset of the infarction. Gd-DTPA uptake at the infarcted area was graded as marked, moderate, or no increase in signal intensity by visual inspection. At these four time intervals, an area of increased signal intensity in the infarcted myocardium was detected on T1-weighted images after administration of Gd-DTPA in 14 (82%) of 17 cases, 16 (94%) of 17 cases, six (38%) of 16 cases, and three (21%) of 14 cases, respectively. Markedly increased signal intensity in infarcted areas was shown on T1-weighted images with Gd-DTPA at 5 and 12 days. The ratio of gadolinium uptake in the infarcted area to that in normal myocardium also was evaluated. At 5 and 12 days, the mean increase in signal intensity in the infarcted area was significantly higher than that in a normal area, but not at 30 and 90 days. Increased signal intensity also was apparent on T2-weighted images without Gd-DTPA at 5 and 12 days; however, the use of late echo reduced the signal-to-noise ratio, leading to image degradation. Uptake of Gd-DTPA was a positive marker in acute myocardial infarction, but no significant uptake of Gd-DTPA occurred in chronic myocardial infarction.\r"

In all patients, the chest radiographs showed patchy air-space consolidation, and in five of six cases, the consolidation was most marked in the middle and upper lung zones. In only one patient was the classic pattern of air-space consolidation that is confined to the outer third of the lungs readily apparent. In three patients, the consolidation appeared to be diffuse, although a slight peripheral predominance was present. In two patients, a peripheral predominance was difficult to appreciate, even in retrospect. The CT scans in all cases showed peripheral air-space consolidation. In addition, mediastinal adenopathy was identified on CT scans in three cases. This has not been described before in association with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. A follow-up CT scan in one patient showed resolution of the adenopathy and marked improvement in the peripheral air-space disease within 2 weeks. We conclude that patients with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia show predominantly peripheral air-space consolidation on CT scans, even when this distribution is not readily apparent on the radiograph. CT may be helpful in the diagnosis when the clinical findings are suggestive, but the radiographic pattern is nonspecific.\r"

The positive predictive value for colonic polyp on single- and double-contrast barium enema was determined for 191 polyps found radiographically in 136 patients who also underwent colonoscopy for confirmation. Of 72 polyps seen in 54 patients on single-contrast examination, 59 were confirmed endoscopically; 110 of 119 polyps seen in 82 patients on double-contrast examination were confirmed similarly, giving positive predictive values of 82% and 92%, respectively. Positive predictive values per patient, disregarding the number of polyps present, were 87% (47/54) and 90% (74/82) for the single- and double-contrast examinations, respectively. False-positive errors were due to stool, air bubbles, haustration, and misinterpretation of an appendiceal stump. By using specificities derived from our prevalence of polypoid disease and previously reported sensitivities, we drew posttest probability curves showing that predictive values depend both on the chance of disease before the test is done and on the efficacy of the test used.\r"

The sentinel clot sign was sensitive, present in 101 (84%) of 120 visceral injuries with only three false-positive cases. Whereas CT visualized the visceral injury itself in 86% of cases, the sentinel clot was the only clue as to the source of hemorrhage in 14% of the cases. Splenic and bowel/mesenteric injuries were frequently subtle, and the focal clot helped to focus attention on the traumatic lesion. In 9% of splenic trauma cases and 32% of bowel/mesenteric injuries, the sentinel clot was the only positive finding. Localized clot is a frequent and accurate sign of injury to an adjacent organ. By facilitating diagnosis of trauma to a specific organ, it may influence the management decision of surgical vs conservative therapy.\r"

Projection angiograms were created by postprocessing a series of two-dimensional, flow-compensated gradient-echo images. Flow velocity was determined by a bolus-tracking method with radiofrequency tagging and multiple data readout periods. Each image was acquired during a breath-hold. MR angiography was applied to six normal subjects and four patients with abnormal hemodynamics in the portal venous system. Flow velocity determined by MR was correlated with the results of duplex sonography. The main portal vein and intrahepatic branches were shown in all cases. Portosystemic collaterals were identified in all patients with portal hypertension. In normal subjects, peak flow velocities (17.9 +/- 2.8 cm/sec) on MR correlated well with values determined by duplex sonography (17.5 +/- 2.2 cm/sec) (r = .846, p less than .04). Reversed portal blood flow was shown in two patients. One patient with portal vein thrombosis had no evidence of flow by MR angiography. Our results indicate that MR angiography can provide a three-dimensional display of normal and abnormal vascular anatomy as well as functional information in the portal venous system.\r"

By using the Dixon sequence in 20 patients, the lipid content of 22 adrenal tumors larger than 15 mm was determined. The mean percentage of lipid in 15 adenomas was 13.4% (standard deviation, 8%), compared with 3.5% lipid (standard deviation, 2%) in seven carcinomas. Only one lesion would have been misclassified on the basis of in vivo measurements of lipid content. After surgery, in vitro MR spectroscopy was used to determine the percentage of lipid in excised samples of nine of the 22 tumors. These in vitro measurements confirmed the in vivo results on lesions larger than 20 mm in diameter. Respiratory artifacts appeared to decrease the accuracy of in vivo measurements in smaller lesions. In vivo MR spectroscopic imaging of adrenal tumors appears to be useful for differentiating between adrenal carcinomas and adenomas.\r"

Radiation osteitis could not be identified on CT scans in the affected bone of any of the patients when tumor was present, but it was present in contiguous bone in two patients and had been shown 6 years before tumor became apparent in the affected bone in one other patient. Radiation-induced sarcoma of bone should be considered when bone destruction and an associated soft-tissue mass are shown on CT, or when changes occur in the appearance of previously stable irradiated bone.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between the clinical course of infants receiving prophylactic \"first-breath\" endotracheal surfactant and their initial posttreatment radiographs. The study population consisted of 80 premature infants of 24-32 weeks gestational age. All received 3 ml of calf-lung surfactant extract via endotracheal tube at birth. Anteroposterior chest radiographs taken within 1 hr of treatment were reviewed and correlated with gestational age, birth weight, days of endotracheal intubation, mean airway pressure, and days of oxygen requirement greater than 30%. Three distinct patterns of radiographic abnormality were encountered: typical RDS with hypoinflation, diffuse granularity, and air bronchograms (30%); central clearing of RDS (14%); and disproportionate clearing of RDS in the right lung (8%). No significant differences in ventilator requirements or clinical course were seen among these three groups. A fourth group (49%), whose posttreatment radiographs showed no evidence of RDS, required significantly less ventilatory support. Prophylactic first-breath surfactant treatment of premature infants occasionally results in radiographic patterns that are atypical for RDS. Familiarity with these patterns and their clinical significance will be important if surfactant augmentation becomes prevalent.\r"

We describe our experience using this technology on children with blunt abdominal trauma. We retrospectively reviewed 54 consecutive ultrafast CT studies and 30 consecutive conventional dynamic CT studies performed on children after blunt abdominal trauma. Thirty percent of the scans showed abnormalities. CT or pathologic follow-up was available for all abnormal cases. We compared scans made with these two techniques for diagnostic accuracy, amount of visible motion on each slice, and contrast enhancement seen on each study. A protocol of 0.4-sec images and 2 ml/kg IV contrast material administered before scanning was used for the ultrafast CT scans. A standard protocol of 2-sec scanning and 3 ml/kg IV contrast material was used for conventional CT studies. There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two techniques. There was significantly less visible motion (p less than .0001) and significantly better contrast enhancement (p less than .0001) seen on the ultrafast CT studies. Two of 54 ultrafast scans had images with sufficient motion to require repeated scanning, compared with 13 of 30 conventional CT studies. In addition, ultrafast scans required less sedation, decreased radiation dose, and improved accessibility of the patient to support personnel. Ultrafast CT is a valuable technique for abdominal imaging, offering equal diagnostic accuracy with improved image quality and important benefits to the patient.\r"

Therefore, we evaluated the procedure in 207 children, each of whom underwent voiding cystourethrography with two or more bladder fillings and voidings. The results showed a discrepancy of presence and/or grade of vesicoureteric reflux from one filling to the other in 22 (12%) of 177 patients with two cycles and in six (20%) of 30 patients with three cycles. No changes were observed with cyclic voiding in cases of grade IV reflux (large, tortuous ureters with pelvic dilatation and caliceal clubbing). The grading of reflux was upgraded from 0 to grade I (into ureter only), II (ureter and collecting system), III (distension of pelvis and calices) by a second voiding cycle in only 3% of patients and by a second and third cycle in 4%. Reflux was downgraded by the second or third filling in a similar percentage. Most changes occurred between minor grades of vesicoureteric reflux. With two fillings, the percentage of agreement of the test (including all grades of reflux) for patients with abnormal findings during the first voiding study was 64%; the percentage of agreement for patients with normal results on the first voiding cystourethrogram was 96%. Voiding cystourethrography is a less reliable test for grading reflux than for documenting the absence of vesicoureteric reflux. Although voiding cystourethrography is a good test to rule out reflux, its diagnostic reliability can be enhanced by a second voiding cycle.\r"

Muscular abnormalities were often detected incidentally in conjunction with lesions of the CNS, cranial nerves, facial bones, and/or temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Specific pathologic alterations observed included anomalies of musculoskeletal development, muscle hypertrophy, atrophy (disuse and denervation), inflammatory disorders, injuries (including contusions, tears, and muscle rupture), posttraumatic musculoskeletal deformities, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Atrophy, fatty replacement, fibrosis, and contracture of selected muscles of mastication may accompany internal derangement of the TMJ in the absence of traumatic deformity. We conclude that MR is a highly accurate imaging method for detecting masticatory muscle disease. Nontraumatic anatomic and physiologic abnormalities of the muscles of mastication are uncommon disorders. Demonstrable muscle alterations frequently accompany fracture dislocations of the mandibular condyle neck and related facial bones onto which masticatory muscles attach.\r"

Intraventricular cysts were present in 14 patients (54%), parenchymal cysts were present in 18 (69%), and intraventricular together with parenchymal cysts were present in six (23%). Intraventricular cysts were detected by mass effect, ventricular obstruction, detection of a cyst rim, and/or CSF flow void adjacent to the cyst. The intensity of most intraventricular and parenchymal cysts presumed to be viable was similar to that of CSF on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Cysts presumed to be degenerated had increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images, probably resulting from increased protein content. Pericystic high signal intensity surrounding lesions of various ages was seen on both proton-density- and T2-weighted images and represents gliosis, edema, and inflammation. Patients with parenchymal cysts had symptoms of seizures, while those with intraventricular cysts generally had symptoms related to obstructive hydrocephalus. Aqueductal stenosis, seen in 10 patients (38%), was possibly due to ependymal inflammation or adhesions caused by prior ventricular infection by neurocysticercosis. One patient with the racemose form of neurocysticercosis demonstrated abundant cyst wall proliferation resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus. In six patients scanned 1-6 months after oral praziquantel therapy, there was no change in the MR appearance of intraventricular cysts, while some parenchymal cysts showed evidence of degeneration. We found MR to be useful in detecting the cysts of neurocysticercosis and the accompanying signs of cyst degeneration and pericystic inflammation. MR was inferior to CT in the detection of parenchymal calcifications.\r"

  ".W": "Axial CT scans of 60 patients with biopsy-proved nasopharyngeal carcinoma were reviewed with particular reference to sites of origin and routes of spread of disease. In all patients there was involvement of the pharyngeal space with blunting of the fossa of Rosenmuller and usually associated thickening of the adjacent levator veli palatini muscle. Tumor infiltration through the pharyngobasilar fascia manifested by obliteration or displacement of the parapharyngeal fat space was seen in 65% of the patients. T-staging by CT showed T1 (28%), T2 (20%), T3 (5%), and T4 (47%) involvement. In three patients there was bilateral symmetric blunting of the fossa of Rosenmuller with no evidence of tumor infiltration into the parapharyngeal space. The scans were initially interpreted as normal except for widening of the preoccipital soft-tissue area in the midline of more than 1.5 cm and up to 2.0 cm in the anteroposterior plane. Biopsy of the postnasal space was positive for tumor in these patients. With symmetric, early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a confident radiologic diagnosis on CT can be difficult. If there is asymmetry of pharyngeal mucosal space or evidence of deep infiltration this should not be a problem. Although lymphoid adenoid tissue can sometimes result in widening of the preoccipital area, it is proposed that widening of this area of greater than 1.5 cm is an additional CT sign of nasopharyngeal carcinoma not previously emphasized. It is the result of early submucosal infiltration of the disease, and a patient with clinically suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma should have aggressive deep biopsies of the fossa of Rosenmuller.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experience has shown that parathyroid adenomas vary in their MR signal intensity, which raises the question of whether the signal intensity is related to different histologic characteristics. In order to address this question, 10 patients who had MR imaging studies (four at 0.35 T, six at 1.5 T) showing large- to medium-sized parathyroid adenomas and who subsequently underwent surgery with histologic proof of the lesion were evaluated. The MR appearance was compared with histologic characteristics. The adenomas were classified into three groups according to the MR appearance: group I, low signal intensity on short TR/TE images, high signal intensity on long TR/TE images (n = 5); group II, low signal intensity on short and long TR/TE images (n = 3); group III, high signal intensity on short and long TR/TE images (n = 2). Histologic analysis revealed that the major features of each group were different. High cellularity without degeneration or fibrosis was observed for all five adenomas from group I. In group II, all three adenomas showed cellular degenerative changes, old hemorrhage with hemosiderin-loaded macrophages, and/or fibrosis. In group III, both adenomas showed evidence of acute hemorrhage without significant degenerative or fibrotic changes. These data suggest that the signal intensity of parathyroid adenomas on T1- and T2-weighted images corresponds at least in part to differences in histologic composition.\r"

A large portion of these prescriptions are written for patients with asymptomatic, complex ventricular arrhythmias and organic heart disease, termed \"potentially malignant\" or \"potentially lethal.\" Since arrhythmia suppression in this population is of unproven benefit, we performed the following study: A total of 246 patients (42% with significant left ventricular dysfunction) had complex ventricular arrhythmias, and were treated with one of eight antiarrhythmic drugs (Vaughan Williams classes IA, IB, IC, II, and III). The extent of arrhythmia suppression and the development of serious complications resulting from therapy after 2 weeks was of primary interest. A total of 82 of 246 (33%) maintained adequate (protocol definition) suppression of both ventricular premature beats (VPBs) as well as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) for 2 weeks, mostly in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% (p = 0.04 versus LVEF less than 40%). Life-threatening complications of antiarrhythmic therapy occurred most frequently in the 61 patients with an LVEF less than 30% compared to the 185 patients with LVEF greater than or equal to 30% (15% versus 2.1%, p = 0.0005). Suppression of VT was achieved nearly twice as commonly in patients with an LVEF greater than or equal to 30% than in those with an LVEF less than 30% (67% versus 36%; p = 0.0008). Life-threatening complications occurred seven times as frequently in patients presenting with nonsustained VT and an LVEF less than 30% (18% versus 2.3%; p = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty inpatients with organic heart disease and multiform ventricular complexes underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring with full disclosure analysis of the number and morphology of single premature ventricular complexes, of repetitive forms of greater than or equal to 2 premature ventricular complexes, and of the variability of coupling intervals (greater than or equal to 40 msec). Multiform premature ventricular complexes were of 3 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- S.D.) different QRS morphologies. Nineteen patients (95%) had repetitive forms of greater than or equal to 2 premature ventricular complexes; 18 patients (90%) showed variable coupling (125 +/- 29 msec). Repetitive forms or variable coupling were present in each (100%) of the 20 patients studied. These data suggest that multiform premature ventricular complexes may be a transitional arrhythmia, since repetitive forms almost always coexist. Variability in coupling, rather than just form and frequency, may be an electrocardiographic characteristic linking single and repetitive forms.\r"

A total of 956 fibrillation-defibrillation sequences were performed at one of four energy levels appropriately selected for each period of fibrillation in 10 anesthetized dogs. The energy values related to 50% (E50) and 80% (E80) of the predicted success were calculated from a logistic regression curve. The E50 and E80 values at 10 seconds after the onset of fibrillation were less than those at 20 seconds after the onset by 7.1% +/- 18.3% and 9.7% +/- 21.4%, respectively; differences were not significant. At 5 seconds after the onset, the differences were 15.3% +/- 14.2% (p less than 0.02) and 16.4% +/- 12.7% (p less than 0.01), respectively. The defibrillation energy efficiency was assessed by dividing the success rate (SR) of fibrillation by the applied energy (E). The maximal SR/E at 5, 10, and 20 seconds of fibrillation was achieved at the energy corresponding to the SRs of 88.8% +/- 4.5%, 90.4% +/- 3.9%, and 88.1% +/- 4.6%, respectively. We conclude that the energy requirement for defibrillation increases with the duration of fibrillation, even shortly after the onset of fibrillation, and the maximal energy efficiency is attained at the energy associated with the SR of approximately 90%.\r"

Recently early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activity (TA) have been proposed as causes of torsades de pointes. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether magnesium suppressed EADs that were initiated in vitro by different agents and if so its mechanism of action. TA arising from EADs was induced by quinidine (1 to 4 mumol/L, n = 5) at high temperature (38.5 to 40 degrees C), cesium chloride (5 to 12 mmol/L, n = 6), and 4-aminopyridine (1.5 to 5 mmol/L, n = 7) in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers superfused with modified Tyrode's solution (KCI = 2.7 mmol/L). MgCl2 (2 to 7 mmol/L) reversibly abolished TA and suppressed EADs. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 to 5 mumol/L) also abolished TA elicited by 4-aminopyridine (n = 6). We then examined the effects of MgCl2, TTX, and verapamil on depolarization-induced automaticity by means of a single sucrose gap technique to gain insight into the mechanism of action of magnesium. MgCl2 (5 mmol/L) abolished automaticity arising from membrane potentials more negative than -70 mV and prolonged the spontaneous cycle length at less negative membrane potentials. The effects of TTX (1 to 5 mumol/L) resembled those of MgCl2. Verapamil (1 mumol/L) prolonged the cycle length of the initial automatic response at high levels of membrane potential and progressively reduced the amplitude of the subsequent automatic potentials. It abolished automaticity arising from less negative membrane potentials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atrial flutter was induced by means of an anatomic obstacle. Seven recording sites, four in the right atrium and three in the left atrium, and three pacing sites, two in the right atrium and one in the left atrium, were selected. After entrainment from the right atrium at pacing cycle lengths that were 94% of the FCL, the first postpacing interval was not significantly different from the intrinsic FCL at each recording site, but it tended to be shorter than the FCL at the recording sites near pacing sites. For entrainment from the left atrium, the first postpacing interval was longer than the FCL at recording sites in the left atrium (p less than 0.001), but it was not different from the FCL at recording sites in the right atrium. These results are due to differences in placement of recording and pacing electrodes relative to the reentrant circuit. Also we observed that activation sequences involving three appropriately selected recording sites were always identical when paced from two different pacing sites at a single constant pacing cycle length. This new phenomenon may best be explained by postulating reentry as the mechanism for atrial flutter.\r"

  ".U": "89371459\r", 
  ".W": "There is little doubt that the \"stunned myocardium\" is amenable to therapeutic intervention, as a host of diverse pharmacologic agents have all been shown to improve short-term contractile function of viable, previously ischemic myocardium. However, few studies have addressed the question: Should the stunned myocardium be forced to contract? If the stunned myocardium is a protective mechanism, then acute recruitment could have later deleterious consequences on recovery of contractile function and high-energy phosphate stores. Conversely, acutely \"resting\" the heart (i.e. by beta-adrenergic blockade) could conceivably enhance or accelerate recovery of the stunned, postischemic tissue. We therefore sought to assess the immediate and longer-term effects of acute recruitment and acute beta-blockade on regional wall thickening (WT: using two-dimensional echocardiography) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in the canine model of the stunned myocardium. Anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 15 minutes of transient coronary artery occlusion. At 30 minutes following reperfusion, the dogs acutely received either: the ultrashort-acting beta-blocker esmolol, the afterload reducing and cardiostimulatory agent hydralazine, or saline. As anticipated, hydralazine enhanced contractile function of the stunned tissue in the short term: WT at 2 hours after treatment was 53.7 +/- 6.9% versus 7.1 +/- 6.5% in treated versus saline controls (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of intravenous nisoldipine (0.12 microgram/kg/min) on diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was studied from simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide measurements in 12 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV cardiac failure. The initial LV filling fraction was low, the peak LV filling rate normalized for end-diastolic volume was decreased, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was high and associated with clinical shortness of breath. Nisoldipine produced an increase in LV filling fraction from 36 +/- 17% to 43 +/- 20% (p = 0.003). The increase in filling took place in both early and late diastole: peak early filling rate (PFR) increased in 11 of the 12 patients (p = 0.02) and late diastolic filling rate (atrial [A] wave in eight of them (NS). When the determinants of these changes, were examined further, it was found that in the control state PFR was inversely related to LV end-systolic volume (r = 0.77), whereas the A wave was related in exponential fashion to PCWP (preload) (r = 0.79). Nisoldipine did not change the slope of these relationships, and it did not alter the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, implying that inherent myocardial relaxation and distensibility were unaltered by the drug. In summary, nisoldipine improved measurements of diastolic LV dysfunction in patients with cardiac failure. This study illustrates the importance of considering ventricular loading conditions when analyzing and interpreting measurements of diastolic ventricular dysfunction. The measured changes in diastolic LV function during infusion of nisoldipine appear to be due to alterations in ventricular loading conditions rather than to a direct myocardial effect of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the new inotropic and vasodilating agent UDCG-115 on hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen metabolism was investigated in 11 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class II to III). After intravenous administration of UDCG-115, cardiac index increased from 3.03 +/- 0.68 to 3.76 +/- 1.07 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.01), left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 31 +/- 13 to 39 +/- 16% (p less than 0.01), and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise increased from 935 +/- 248 to 1056 +/- 284 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic wall stress (index of preload) and left ventricular end-systolic wall stress (index of afterload) decreased by 41% (p less than 0.01) and 34% (p less than 0.001), respectively. Heart rate did not change significantly. With UDCG-115 myocardial oxygen consumption decreased from 14.3 +/- 5.1 to 10.6 +/- 3.8 ml/min/100 gm (p less than 0.05), and the ratio of myocardial oxygen supply to myocardial oxygen demand increased from 1.40 +/- 0.08 to 1.53 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.05). Thus intravenous UDCG-115 improves left ventricular function by increasing inotropism and reducing preload and afterload in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and moderate congestive heart failure. The systemic hemodynamic actions are associated with favorable effects on myocardial energetics.\r"

However, very little work has been done so far to understand changes in the sympathetic system and cardiac adrenoceptors soon after an increased work load is imposed on the heart. Accordingly rat hearts subjected to aortic banding-induced pressure overload were assessed 3, 7, and 14 days postoperatively. Sham-operated rats without aortic banding were used as a control group. Rats with aortic constriction had increases in heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, and total mechanical energy during the entire study period. The cardiac RNA level was increased without a significant increase in left ventricular mass on days 3 and 7 in aortic-banded animals; these results were associated with a decrease in the cardiac norepinephrine (NE) store and an increase in the plasma level of NE and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. By day 14 a significant increase in left ventricular mass and the NE store were found; both plasma NE and DBH remained elevated. Catecholamines in other tissues such as the spleen and kidney were depleted in the banded group, whereas the dopamine level, particularly in the brain, was significantly higher during the entire study. Furthermore, the density of alpha-adrenoceptors was higher on day 3 of aortic banding, and a reciprocal correlation was evident between cardiac alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on day 14; the density of beta-adrenoceptors was increased, whereas that of alpha-adrenoceptors was decreased in the banded group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because of the concern about the ability of the morphologic right ventricle (MRV) to function over a long term as a systemic ventricle, adult patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) were evaluated to determine the long-term function of the MRV. Morphologic right ventricular function was assessed by functional clinical classification and angiographic ejection fraction in 18 adult patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. These patients had a mean age of 30.2 +/- 14.5 years (range 10 to 67 years). All but one had hemodynamically significant lesions, the most common being left atrioventricular valve regurgitation (11 patients), ventricular septal defect (seven patients), atrial septal defect (four patients), and pulmonic stenosis (three patients). The mean MRV ejection fraction at presentation was 55% +/- 11.5% (range 24% to 74%). Twelve of the 18 patients (67%) were followed clinically, with a mean follow-up time of 9.9 +/- 7.1 years (range 1 to 22 years). Eight were reassessed angiographically, with a mean MRV ejection fraction of 51.3% +/- 10.7% (range 30% to 67%). The other four were followed up clinically and evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography, with normal MRV function in two patients. Eight of 12 patients (67%) were in functional class I at follow-up, one was in functional class II, one was in functional class III, and two had died. Our data suggest that the morphologic right ventricle can function appropriately over a long term in adult patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling rate has been reported to be reduced in hypertensive patients. To investigate the possible influence of altered LV diastolic function in hypertension on peripheral vascular regulation, hemodynamic measurements were obtained in 16 hypertensive patients in the resting supine position and during head-up tilt. The study population included seven men and nine women with an age range of 30 to 62 years (mean, 49.5 years +/- 10.6). Measurements included LV peak filling rate (+dv/dt), LV peak ejection rate (-dv/dt), LV ejection fraction, heart rate, total peripheral resistance, stroke volume, and cardiac index. Moreover, we calculated the ratio relating left ventricular filling rate to left ventricular ejection rate (+dv/dt/-dv/dt) because a complex interaction between ventricular contraction and relaxation is well recognized. We observed that in patients with slow diastolic filling rate (ratio +dv/dt/-dv/dt less than 0.9), the increase in total peripheral resistance in response to head-up tilt was less marked than in those with normal LV filling rate (+dv/dt/-dv/dt greater than or equal to 0.9), whereas changes in stroke volume during tilt were not statistically different between the two groups. Conversely, supine resting cardiac index and total peripheral resistance was not significantly different among groups. We conclude that abnormal diastolic filling is associated with abnormal cardiovascular adjustment to changes in body posture. We suggest that the altered response to head-up posture is related to decreased sensitivity of low pressure receptors in the cardiopulmonary area as a result of impaired LV diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the extent, determinants, and functional consequences of reversal of left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, 38 patients with severe aortic regurgitation were studied pre- and postoperatively by serial echocardiography and radionuclide cineangiography. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension normalized in 58% of patients by 9 +/- 6 months postoperatively, at which time 50% of patients had normalized mass; cumulative normalization rose to 66% for end-diastolic dimension and 68% for left ventricular mass during further follow-up. All patients who had normalized end-diastolic dimension also had normal postoperative ejection fractions (mean 61 +/- 8%). In contrast, patients in whom the left ventricle remained dilated had a 42% prevalence of subnormal postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction. Preoperative left ventricular end-systolic dimension less than or equal to 55 mm identified 86% of patients in whom end-diastolic dimension normalized, whereas end-systolic dimension exceeded 55 mm in 81% of those with persistent dilatation; other proposed preoperative predictors of operative outcome correctly identified lower proportions (from 59% to 71%) of patients in whom left ventricular size did or did not normalize. In conclusion, aortic valve replacement resulted in normalized left ventricular chamber size and mass in two thirds of the patients selected for operation by current criteria; favorable geometric outcome is associated with persistence or recovery of normal left ventricular function.\r"

Our objective was to resolve this uncertainty by pooling all existing English language case reports in order to examine the relationship of treatment with survival. There were 71 published reports involving 119 subjects, of which 93% presented with abnormal cardiac signs and symptoms and 7% were asymptomatic but had risk factors for pulmonary embolism. The only factors that were significantly related to survival were whether pulmonary emboli were present, and the type of treatment actually received. Variables not significantly related to survival included cardiac symptoms and the echocardiographic appearance of the thrombus. The estimated probability of survival in patients with pulmonary emboli receiving heparin, thrombolytic agents, surgical embolectomy, or none of the above, was 0.70, 0.62, 0.62, and 0.19, respectively, while the estimated probability of survival in patients without pulmonary emboli for the same four treatment groups, was 0.92, 0.89, 0.89, and 0.53, respectively. We conclude that the efficacy of all three treatments are similar, and that they enhance the probability of survival. Because of the similar efficacy of drug therapy and surgery and the convenience of the former, drug therapy should probably be chosen. In addition, considering the small advantage of heparin with respect to the probability of survival, heparin may be the best choice if the illness is not characterized by a rapid downhill course.\r"

Cox model regression analyses demonstrated an interaction (p less than 0.01) between type A behavior and an index of disease severity in the prediction of cardiovascular death. Among those with relatively poor left ventricular function, type A patients had better survival than type B. This difference was not present among patients with better prognoses. Type A behavior did not predict the subsequent incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Differential risk modification and differential selection into postinfarction status are possible explanations for the findings. These results need not conflict with the proposition that type A behavior plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.\r"

In selected patients with effort angina and proven coronary artery disease, the cineangiographic pattern after 2-year therapy with nifedipine (group 1, 39 patients), propranolol (group 2, 36 patients) or isosorbide dinitrate (group 3, 38 patients) was compared to that before treatment. The disease evolved to a different extent in the 3 groups. Patients with evidence of progression of old narrowings and appearance of new narrowings were significantly fewer in group 1 (31% and 10%) than in group 2 (53% and 34%) and group 3 (47% and 29%). The number of stenoses with evidence of progression was significantly smaller after nifedipine (14), and larger after propranolol (39) compared with group 3 (24). Thus, nifedipine seemed more protective than the other 2 drugs against coronary atherosclerosis. The coronary risk factors were normal in the nifedipine group and remained so with treatment, suggesting that they were dissociated from influences on atherosclerosis. The evolution, as judged by the number of narrowings with progression, appeared significantly (p less than 0.01) worse with propranolol than with isosorbide dinitrate. Propranolol caused unfavorable modifications of serum lipids; there was a 28% increase in total triglycerides and a 25% decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months in group 2.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of regional and global left ventricular dysfunction due to isolated left circumflex (LC) artery stenosis were determined from the contrast ventriculograms of 52 patients studied during acute myocardial infarction. In patients with a left dominant coronary circulation (35%), the severity, circumferential extent and location of hypokinesia resembled those of right coronary artery stenosis. However, in patients with a right dominant or balanced circulation (65%), the location of LC artery-related hypokinesia varied over the entire left ventricular contour, overlapping with the territories of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries. The method for measuring the severity of hypokinesia was adjusted to take into account the wide territory of the LC artery. This enhanced the sensitivity of the method, particularly in the right anterior oblique view, as indicated by the greater severity of hypokinesia measured (-2.5 +/- 0.9 vs -1.8 +/- 1.1 standard deviations by our previously published method, p less than 0.001). However, the overlap of the artery territories may make it difficult to selectively measure the dysfunction due to stenosis of an artery of interest in patients with multiple infarctions. The circumferential extent of hypokinesia due to LC artery thrombosis was greater in the left than the right anterior oblique view. When averaged over both views, the size of the dysfunctional segment approached that due to left anterior descending coronary artery thrombosis, exceeding the size previously reported. These results suggest that current eligibility criteria for thrombolytic therapy select patients with extensive LC artery beds.\r"

  ".W": "Many clinical trials or population studies have used change in Minnesota Q code, ST-segment depression code or T-wave inversion code as evidence of new myocardial infarction or new coronary heart disease event. Direct electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform comparison is a new standardized procedure for diagnosing interim myocardial infarction from ECGs classified according to the Minnesota code (serial Q-wave pattern change). This procedure was investigated for its application in epidemiologic studies. Use of this procedure in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial resulted in a 50% increase in the positive predictive accuracy, improved agreement with clinically defined myocardial infarction and a strong independent prognostic association with total and coronary heart disease mortality. Among those with major Minnesota Q-code findings, there was substantial variation in mortality. The 5-year coronary heart disease death rates estimated by life table analysis were 8.5% for those with major serial Q-wave pattern change, 5.1% for those with minor serial Q-wave pattern change and 1.5 to 2.6% for those with major or minor Minnesota Q-code change not substantiated by direct waveform comparison, compared with 2.4% for those with no Minnesota Q-code findings. The coronary heart disease death rate for those with major serial Q-wave pattern change was greater than that for the other ECG groups (p less than 0.01). Adjustment for age and other risk factors did not qualitatively alter these findings. This new approach is eminently suitable for export to other investigators, for incorporation into computer analysis programs and for statistical analysis.\r"

In 21 of 147 patients (14%), 2 views could not be measured for technical reasons, even though all angiographers had tried to film 2 views. Lesion severity was slightly worse for 1 compared with 2 views (3.3 +/- 3.3% before PTCA, 3.6 +/- 3.8% after PTCA and 3.1 +/- 3.8% at follow-up). Similarly, minimal diameter was less for 1 view (0.11 +/- 0.09 mm before PTCA, 0.15 +/- 0.12 mm after PTCA and 0.13 +/- 0.09 mm at 6 months). When this systematic difference was taken into account, the 2 methods were within +/- 0.1 mm for minimal diameter in 288 of 376 measurements (77%) and within +/- 0.2 mm in 96%. For percent diameter stenosis the 2 methods were within +/- 5% in 90% and within +/- 10% in all but 2.7% (10 of 376). Thus, for routine clinical assessment, measurement of 1 view is adequate; for research purposes orthogonal views may sometimes be required.\r"

This matrix approach allows for multiple test outcomes (both tests positive, both negative, 1 test positive and 1 negative) and multiple disease states (no coronary artery disease vs 1-vessel vs multivessel coronary artery disease). Because this approach analyzes the results of 2 test outcomes simultaneously rather than serially, it also negates the lack of test independence, if such an effect is present. It is also demonstrated that ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram and defects on initial thallium-201 images provide conditionally independent information regarding the presence of coronary artery disease in patients without prior myocardial infarction. In contrast, ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram and redistribution on the delayed thallium-201 images may not provide totally independent information regarding the presence of exercise-induced ischemia in patients with or without myocardial infarction.\r"

Of 83 cases that have been described, 62 were diagnosed at autopsy and 21 were found antemortem. A series of 11 patients with the antemortem diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is reported and follow-up is provided for 16 of the 21 previously reported cases. Of the 62 autopsy cases, 10 (16%) were men (mean age 47) and 52 (84%) were women (mean age 40). Dissection of the left anterior descending coronary artery predominated in this group of patients, occurring in 80% of men and 65% of women. Of the 32 cases diagnosed antemortem, 15 (47%) were men (mean age 46) and 17 (53%) were women (mean age 38). Men were found to have dissection predominantly of the right coronary artery (73%). Women were found to have dissection predominantly of the left coronary artery system (88%). The etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection remains unclear. The 3 groups that can be identified are those associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, those in the postpartum period and those found to be idiopathic. Of the 94 known cases, 69 (73%) occurred in women; 21 (31%) of these were associated with the postpartum state. The prognosis of patients surviving the initial event is good, with an 82% survival rate (follow-up: range 1.5 to 144 months, mean 38). The indications for medical or surgical treatment are presented. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any young person sustaining an acute myocardial infarction, especially women in the postpartum state.\r"

Each patient had evidence of prior myocardial infarction, 1 or more occluded coronary arteries and a readily identifiable collateral vessel that provided collateral flow to the infarct-related artery. In each patient, the clinical arrhythmia was reproducibly inducible by programmed stimulation in the control state. After positioning a small infusion catheter in the collateral vessel, selective intracoronary lidocaine 0.3 to 0.6 mg/min (patients 1 and 2) or procainamide 0.1 to 1.4 mg/min (patient 3) was infused for a 10-minute period. In each patient the clinical arrhythmia was rendered noninducible during selective intracoronary drug infusion. The arrhythmia was again inducible after a 10-minute drug-washout period and also after standard intravenous doses of antiarrhythmic drug. Selective intracoronary antiarrhythmic drug infusion may help to localize the site of origin of some cardiac arrhythmias, may provide a means of testing the effects of several drugs during a single study and may be a new method for studying mechanisms of action of antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

In study 1, the electrocardiogram (paper speed at 50 mm/s, 800 measurements/subject) was recorded in 11 subjects (5 men, 6 women) at rest, during dynamic exercise and after rapid intravenous injections of isoproterenol (0.2 to 12.8 micrograms), before and after intravenous atropine (2 mg). In study 2, the QT-RR relation was studied at rest and during exercise in 12 subjects (6 men, 6 women) before and after oral propranolol (80 mg). The results confirmed a monoexponential individual relation of the QT and RR intervals during rest and exercise: QT = A-B.Exp (-k.RR). By pooling the RR-QT plots from the 11 subjects in study 1, we found that the measured QT interval = 425-676.Exp (-3.7.10(-3) RR. During isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, QT either did not change or increased and this may indicate an increase in temporal dispersion of ventricular repolarization. Atropine-induced tachycardia produced changes similar to those resulting from exercise testing. Propranolol did not change the QT-RR relation despite a lengthening in RR intervals. These results suggest that physiologic QT-RR adaptation is mainly under parasympathetic control.\r"

To determine their prevalence and relation with common characteristics, stress thallium-201 scintigraphy was performed in 28 patients. Eleven (39%) had positive scans despite normal epicardial coronary arteries (7 patients) or a pretest risk of coronary disease less than or equal to 5% (4 patients). There was no relation between thallium defects and age, sex, chest pain or outflow tract gradients at rest. However, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in those with perfusion abnormalities compared with those without (64 +/- 15 vs 75 +/- 11%, respectively, p less than 0.05). Also, the mean ventricular septal thickness was greater in patients with positive scans (27 +/- 7 vs 21 +/- 6 mm, p less than 0.05), and there was a nonparametric relation between increasing septal thickness and the frequency of positive scans (p less than 0.025). Seven of 11 patients with positive scans had ventricular tachycardia compared with none among those who had negative scans (p less than 0.001), and 5 of these 11 patients had conduction system disease requiring permanent pacemaker insertion compared with 1 of 17 with negative scans (p less than 0.025). It is concluded that thallium perfusion abnormalities are common in patients with HC in the absence of epicardial coronary disease, and are strongly associated with potentially lethal arrhythmias. Thallium scintigraphy appears to identify a subset of patients with HC at increased risk for sudden death, who therefore require closer follow-up.\r"

Aortic root dilatation is currently detected by nomograms based on M-mode echocardiographic data. Aortic root diameters measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography at the anulus, sinuses of Valsalva, supra-aortic ridge and proximal ascending aorta in 135 normal adults and 52 normal children were compared with age, gender, body habitus, blood pressure and stroke volume, and with M-mode findings and normal limits. Two-dimensional measurements at the sinuses of Valsalva were larger than M-mode aortic root values (p less than 0.001), and use of 2-dimensional values with M-mode nomograms falsely diagnosed aortic dilatation in 40% of normal children and 19% of normal adults. Two-dimensional measurements at the sinuses closely correlated with body surface area in children (r = 0.93, p less than 0.0005), moderately in adults younger than 40 years of age (r = 0.71, p less than 0.0005) and weakly in older adults (r = 0.40, p less than 0.0005). In adults, gender influenced aortic root size at all levels (p less than 0.001), but dimensions were similar when indexed for body surface area. Age strongly influenced supraaortic ridge and ascending aortic diameters; blood pressure and stroke volume had no independent effect on aortic size. In conclusion, (1) 2-dimensional echocardiographic aortic root dimensions are influenced by age and body size but not by blood pressure; (2) aortic root dilatation is overdiagnosed when aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is compared with M-mode nomograms; (3) nomograms comparing aortic diameter with body surface area should be used in children; and (4) although use of nomograms based on body size in adults should maximize sensitivity for aortic dilatation, 98% specificity is attained by use of an upper normal limit of 2.1 cm/m2 for aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva in both men and women.\r"

Because of an association between obesity and high levels of several coagulation factors, the effect of weight loss on coagulation factors VII and X was investigated among subjects taking part in a 3-month weight loss study. At baseline, both coagulation factors were correlated with age, Quetelet's index, total cholesterol and triglycerides. During the diet period, the subjects lost an average of 3.5 kg at 1 month and 4.2 kg at 3 months, whereas lipoproteins changed in only minor ways. In the group as a whole, factor VII and X both decreased at 1 month but returned to or exceeded the baseline levels despite continued weight loss at 3 months. Although changes in weight, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were correlated with the changes in the factors during the first month, during months 2 and 3 these correlations remained substantial only for triglycerides. Multiple regression analysis indicated that changes in weight, cholesterol and triglycerides could not explain the decreasing and increasing pattern in factors VII and X. These data suggest that weight itself does not explain the association between obesity and factors VII and X, and that weight loss does not effectively decrease the levels of these factors.\r"

Patients underwent sequential exercise tests with Doppler echocardiography and ultrafast cine computed tomography (CT). RV systolic pressure during exercise was determined by saline-enhanced Doppler of tricuspid regurgitation. RV ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, stroke volume and cardiac index were obtained by CT at rest and peak exercise. Sixteen of the 21 study patients also exercised on high-flow oxygen. In the control subjects RV systolic pressure increased from 21 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) at rest to 32 +/- 8 mm Hg at peak exercise, whereas in patients with lung disease, RV systolic pressure increased from 42 +/- 17 to 81 +/- 26 mm Hg (both p less than 0.01). Compared with the control subjects, the patients with lung disease had significantly lower mean values for RV ejection fraction at rest (47 +/- 7 vs 55 +/- 7%) and at peak exercise (47 +/- 9 vs 57 +/- 3%, respectively, both p less than 0.05). The patients who demonstrated oxyhemoglobin desaturation during exercise showed the most abnormal cardiac responses, with marked increases in mean RV systolic pressure, decreases in mean RV ejection fraction and blunted increases in cardiac index and RV stroke volume. Although acute oxygen supplementation was associated with a slight decrease in RV systolic pressure at peak exercise and a longer duration of exercise, there was no significant improvement in RV function. Doppler echocardiography and CT provide complementary and potentially useful information about right-sided heart pressures and RV ejection fraction during exercise in patients with advanced chronic lung disease. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation during exercise is a marker for the most abnormal pulmonary vascular reserve, as indicated by RV contractile dysfunction and limited ability to increase cardiac index.\r"

The choices now include ultrasound with Doppler, single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, cine computed tomography, biplane and digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the most expensive noninvasive option, but also provides the best information on chamber size, wall motion, valvular function and great vessel blood flow. It is multiplanar and multiparametric; thus, nearly any clinical problem except detailed coronary anatomy can be addressed, but the very plethora of technical details is daunting. With contrast agents as indicators, relative tissue perfusion of any organ appears achievable, including regional perfusion of the myocardial wall. As patient acceptance is high, MRI may become a major cardiac imaging tool and occupy the central position between office ultrasound and invasive angiography.\r"

The multicomponent model assumes the density of FFM varies by age and sex because of differences in its constituents. With FFM values from the multicomponent model as the dependent variable and impedance and anthropometry as the independent variables, prediction equations were derived by all possible subsets of regression (140 males, 110 females). These equations had RMSEs of 2.2-2.3 kg and CVs of 5.0-5.8%. Cross-validation results were excellent for young adults but less satisfactory for children for whom a different calf skinfold had been measured. The selected equations are applicable to healthy white individuals aged 7-25 y.\r"

Body cell mass was estimated as total body-potassium content and determined by whole-body counting. There was progressive depletion of body cell mass as patients neared death. The extrapolated and observed values for body cell mass at death were 54% of normal. Body weight had a similar relationship to death, with a projected body weight at death of 66% of ideal. We conclude that death from wasting in AIDS is related to the magnitude of tissue depletion and is independent of the underlying cause of wasting. The degree of wasting seen in this study is similar to historical reports of semistarvation, with or without associated infections. This observation suggests that successful attempts to maintain body mass could prolong survival in patients with AIDS.\r"

A specific hypothesis was that an inverse relationship exists between past body weight and future energy intake whereas a direct relationship exists between past energy intake and future weight. Daily energy intakes of 29 male (n = 13) and female (n = 16) adult subjects were related through linear-regression analysis to sex (+ for males), age (-), height (+), weight (- for past and present measurements, + for future measurement), data collection method (- for duplicate plate), day of week (+ for Friday and Saturday), and month (+ for May, July, August, December, and January). These relationships were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The results confirmed the hypothesis and were in general agreement with previously published studies that used larger samples but fewer days of data.\r"

  ".W": "Aggressive oncological chemotherapy often impairs the nutritional status of tumor patients. To evaluate the pathogenetic mechanisms, food intake in 13 cancer patients was investigated in correlation with nitrogen losses, N balances, muscle wasting, and weight course, during cytostatic therapy. Median daily N and energy intakes were reduced only in patients with weight loss [0.55 g protein, 16.5 kcal/kg ideal body wt (IBW)]. Patients with constant weight had the same intake as control subjects (1.27 g protein, 37.2 kcal IBW). N balances and creatinine height index (CHI) correlated with daily nutrient intake. Fecal N excretions did not correlate with urinary losses; there was no excess of fecal N loss because of cytostatic treatment. The impairment of cancer patients' nutritional status seems to depend primarily on the decrease of spontaneous oral intake as a consequence of the side effects of tumor therapy. Changes in CHI, compared before and after chemotherapy, indicated muscle wasting of weight-losing patients.\r"

It is not known if current methods for the estimation of total body fat (TBF) are adequate for this purpose. In this paper earlier reported data from 29 women are used to show how methodology affects estimates of changes in TBF during reproduction. Skinfold thicknesses are also reported and equations relating these measurements to TBF were developed and used to demonstrate how well the skinfold technique could estimate such changes. No correlation was found between changes in body weight and body fat during early pregnancy or between the maternal changes in body weight and body fat over the complete pregnancy. These findings are tentatively explained by changes in the degree of hydration of the body.\r"
