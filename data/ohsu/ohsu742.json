  ".W": "The diagnostic value of gadolinium-DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated by thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction was assessed in 27 consecutive patients who had a first acute myocardial infarction (14 anterior, 13 inferior) and who underwent thrombolytic treatment and coronary arteriography within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 93 hours (range 15-241) after the onset of symptoms. A Philips Gyroscan (0.5 T) was used, and spin echo measurements (echo time 30 ms) were made before and 20 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA. In all patients contrast enhancement of the infarcted areas was seen after Gd-DTPA. The signal intensities of the infarcted and normal values were used to calculate the intensity ratios. Mean (SD) intensity ratios after Gd-DTPA were significantly increased (1.15 (0.17) v 1.52 (0.29). Intensity ratios were higher in the 17 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging more than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms than in the 10 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging earlier, the difference being significantly greater after administration of Gd-DTPA (1.38 (0.12) v 1.61 (0.34). When patients were classified according to the site and size of the infarcted areas, or to reperfusion (n = 19) versus non-reperfusion (n = 8), the intensity ratios both before and after Gd-DTPA did not show significant differences. Magnetic resonance imaging with Gd-DTPA improved the identification of acutely infarcted areas, but with current techniques did not identify patients in whom thrombolytic treatment was successful.\r"

  ".W": "Subcostal echocardiography of the left ventricle was continuously recorded during balloon dilatation of the aortic valve in ten consecutive elderly patients. Left ventricular wall motion decreased gradually during a minute of maintained complete balloon inflation. Blind analysis of M mode echocardiograms showed a significant reduction in fractional shortening. Deflation of the balloon resulted in global left ventricular hyperkinesia. There was a transient overshoot in fractional shortening, wall thickness, and blood pressure approximately 40 s after deflation of the balloon. The myocardial reaction was similar to that known to occur regionally with brief coronary artery obstruction, whereas the timing of the events seemed to be dissociated from the timing of changes in left ventricular load. Thus it is likely that the left ventricular response during valve dilatation reflects not only changes in load but also an ischaemia-reperfusion effect on the myocardium. The systolic thickening of the hypertrophied interventricular septum was slightly reduced after balloon dilatation. This finding might be a result of repeated episodes of ischaemia and reperfusion. However, the potential for myocardial injury seemed to be unimportant clinically.\r"

There were two late deaths--one 38 days after operation, associated with an unrelated neurosurgical procedure and the other 2 years 6 months after when aortic root enlargement and replacement of the aortic valve were performed. During this period two other infants presented with aortic stenosis. One, who was very ill before transfer, died before operation could be performed. The second patient had a hypoplastic left ventricle with a small mitral valve ring and was, therefore, considered to be part of a different subgroup. All the surviving children have been followed up (median length of follow up 2 years and 11 months, range 7 months-5 years). Left ventricular function, in terms of percentage systolic wall thickening, was shown to be significantly impaired in all age groups. Peak diastolic thinning was abnormal in those children aged from 3 to 5. The aortic valve gradient, as assessed by peak instantaneous continuous wave Doppler, was less than 40 mm Hg in five patients and between 40 and 70 mm Hg in seven patients. One patient, with appreciable restenosis, has undergone successful percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve.\r"

Twenty nine patients had a Bjork-Shiley prosthesis in both mitral and tricuspid positions and six had Carpentier-Edwards valves in both sites. Five of the patients had abnormal tricuspid prostheses on the basis of clinical and echocardiographic criteria. Pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography was used in all examinations. The pressure half times for the normal tricuspid prosthetic valves, 105 (40) ms (Bjork-Shiley) and 97 (53) ms (Carpentier-Edwards), were significantly longer than those of normal mitral prosthetic valves, 75 (18) ms (Bjork-Shiley) and 83 (15) ms (Carpentier-Edwards). The range of pressure half times for the abnormal tricuspid valves (237-530 ms) was distinct from that of the apparently normal tricuspid prosthetic valves (38-197 ms). There was an increase in the peak velocity of the obstructed tricuspid prosthetic valves (1.69 (0.12) m/s) in comparison with normal prostheses (1.06 (0.26) m/s). The normal range of pressure half times for the Bjork-Shiley and Carpentier-Edwards valves in the mitral position is not applicable to the same valves in the tricuspid position. The valve appears to function well with very long pressure half times but a pressure half time of greater than 200 ms coupled with a peak velocity of greater than 1.60 ms without significant valve regurgitation indicates tricuspid obstruction of the tricuspid prosthetic valve.\r"

The patterns of ejection during pressure development and decline were similar in patients after relief of pressure load and in those with isolated volume load. A right ventricular pressure load, however, reduced ejection during the two \"isovolumic\" periods, and the overall shape of the pressure-volume loop resembled that of the normal left ventricle. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained from the left ventricle after the Mustard procedure were indistinguishable from the normal right ventricle, which accords with the hypothesis that the normal right ventricular contraction pattern is a consequence of loading conditions rather than a reflection of an intrinsic property of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Four infants and children with anomalous connection of the left coronary artery to the pulmonary trunk were studied with colour Doppler flow mapping. In three the diagnosis was only suspected when the colour Doppler study showed dilated intraseptal and epicardial vessels and an abnormal flow signal into the pulmonary artery in diastole; this latter signal localised the exact site of communication, which was not apparent on angiocardiography. Two of these patients had previously had operations for severe mitral regurgitation, the diagnosis of anomalous left coronary artery having been previously considered in one but missed despite aortic root angiography. The colour study in the fourth was largely confirmatory, operation without catheterisation being undertaken on the basis of the echocardiographic images. By contrast in two infants subsequently seen with congestive cardiomyopathy the demonstration of flow direction in the left coronary artery confirmed that it was normally connected to the aorta. Colour Doppler flow mapping can show flow direction in the left coronary artery and from the mouth of an anomalous coronary artery into the pulmonary artery, thus simplifying the diagnosis and allowing the site of the connection of the left coronary artery to the pulmonary artery to be determined with precision.\r"

Thirty three patients had post-exercise thallium defects and 19 had ST 1 mm greater than or equal to segment depression during exercise electrocardiography. Both tests were positive in 13 patients. Coronary angiography was subsequently performed on 33 patients with either scintigraphic and/or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Angiographically significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% narrowing of the coronary artery lumen) was detected in 13 patients. Six patients had minimal coronary artery stenosis (less than 50%), and 14 had normal coronary arteries. Six patients refused cardiac catheterisation. In 14 out of 27 patients with post-exercise thallium defects coronary angiography did not show any coronary artery stenoses (positive predictive accuracy 48%). Exercise electrocardiography showed only one false positive result (positive predictive accuracy 94%) but failed to detect coronary artery disease in three patients with a positive scintigraphic result. The accuracy of a positive exercise electrocardiographic test seems to be better than that of a positive thallium tomographic scan for detecting asymptomatic coronary artery disease in diabetic patients. The high number of false positive thallium defects may be the result of technical features inherent in thallium tomography and/or the possible disease of the small intramyocardial arteries in diabetic patients.\r"

This retrospective study was carried out to assess the efficacy and complication rate of this procedure. The case notes of all patients undergoing cyclocryotherapy at a single centre over a 10-year period were reviewed. Case records were available for 68 eyes of 64 people. Thirty-eight eyes had neovascular glaucoma, nine had aphakic glaucoma, nine had angle closure glaucoma, three had primary open angle glaucoma, and nine had secondary open angle glaucoma. The mean follow-up periods for these groups varied from 2.0-6.3 years. The mean reduction in intraocular pressure following treatment varied from 7.9 mm Hg in the secondary open angle glaucoma group to 24.3 mm Hg in those with angle closure glaucoma. Pressure was controlled in 29.4% overall, ranging from 66.7% in the angle closure and primary open angle groups to 0% in the secondary open angle group. Of the painful eyes 71% were rendered comfortable, indicating that pain relief from cyclocryotherapy is not due solely to pressure control. 30% of the patients lost their vision following the procedure, phthisis occurred in 11.8% and four eyes (5.9%) went on to enucleation. Our results indicate that cyclocryotherapy affords good pain relief, without good pressure control, in various types of glaucoma. While there is an apparent high complication rate, visual loss and phthisis cannot be ascribed directly to the procedure, since these are eyes with a poor prognosis.\r"

Astigmatism and reduced contrast sensitivity, especially in the presence of glare, were important complications. For keratoconus, 86% of seven patients with over two months of follow-up achieved a spectacle corrected acuity of 6/9 or better.

The major causes of blindness up to age 35 were corneal disease from xerophthalmia and trachoma and above age 45 cataract. Trauma was a major cause of monocular blindness. The prevalence of trachoma and its complications was 42.8% and the prevalence of cataract 5.2%. Cataract begins to form at an early age (25-35). The prevalence of xerophthalmia was 44%. These findings are similar to previously reported studies in Africa, especially in semiarid areas. The main remedy lies in improvement of education and the environment.\r"

Group 1 consisted of 99 students attending a girls' boarding school, group 2 of 200 patients selected randomly from 1000 examined at the local clinic. Moderate to severe hyperaemia and papillary responses were present in the palpebral conjunctiva of all patients, and 234 (66%) had subconjunctival haemorrhages. Transient superficial punctate keratitis was noted in over 60% of patients. A transient flare suggestive of a low grade iritis was seen in five patients. No neurological disorders were noted. Serological studies were carried out on patients from group 2. Fifteen paired and 20 single serum samples were titrated against adenovirus type 4 (Ad-4) and enterovirus type 70 (EV-70). Two pairs of sera showed a 4-fold rise in antibody levels to EV-70, whereas the antibody titres to EV-70 in the rest of the sera ranged from 1:20 (no antibody) to 1:160. None of the paired serum samples showed a 4-fold rise in antibody levels to adenovirus. The results of clinical studies and serological findings support EV-70 as a probable cause of AHC in Nigeria.\r"

Two main patterns of 'at risk' rupture were noted: a temporally situated rupture passing almost directly through the fovea, and a rupture which curves inferior or superior to the optic disc stopping just short of the fovea. In six of eight cases there was only a partial thickness rupture of the choroid. These neovascular membranes may present at any time after the original injury, either early (within six months of the injury), which could be related to persistence of the normal reparative neovascular response, or late (at least one year after the injury), which are more likely to have resulted from a secondary breakdown of the outer blood-retina barrier.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the changes of intraocular pressure throughout the day in 16 patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and 15 normal control subjects of similar age and race. The peak intraocular pressure exceeded 21 mm Hg in five of the ischaemic optic neuropathy patients but none of the controls. The mean peak intraocular pressure was 19.9 mm Hg for the ischaemic optic neuropathy group versus 17.6 mm Hg for controls (p = 0.034). The range of intraocular pressure was also greater for the ischaemic optic neuropathy group (p = 0.030). Eight of 16 ischaemic optic neuropathy patients had a range of intraocular pressure of 6 mm Hg or more, compared with three of 15 control subjects. The intraocular pressure exceeded 21 mm Hg during a subsequent visit in two additional patients in whom the hourly determined intraocular pressure peaked at less than 21 mm Hg. Thus, seven of 16 of our ischaemic optic neuropathy group had an intraocular pressure exceeding 21 mm Hg during the study period. Raised intraocular pressure may be a predisposing factor in some patients who develop anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Using an immunogold staining technique and electron microscopy, we investigated the localization of the alpha-granule pool of glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa in normal platelets and maturing megakaryocytes (MK), in pathologic platelets from a patient with type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT), and from three patients with the gray platelet syndrome (GPS). In normal resting platelets, GPIIb-IIIa was observed on the plasmatic side of the plasma membrane, the open canicular system (OCS) membranes, and along the internal face of the alpha-granule membrane. This location was found with three monospecific polyclonal antibodies: one anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody, the second specific for GPIIb, and the third specific for GPIIIa. After thrombin stimulation, the alpha-granule labeling disappeared whereas membrane labeling increased. Platelets from GT did not display labeling on plasma membranes, OCS membranes, or alpha-granule membranes. Platelets from the three patients with GPS displayed intense labeling of the plasma membrane and the OCS membrane, as well as the abnormal small alpha-granules and along the inside of large vacuoles (which contain the granule membrane protein [GMP]-140). In cultured immature MK from normal progenitors, both peptide components of GPIIb-IIIa appeared in the Golgi saccules and vesicles, and in the small precursors of alpha-granules, labeling both their membranes and their matrix. It was then observed only on the membrane of the mature MK alpha-granules, although labeling was less consistent than on the platelet granules. The MK plasma membrane and demarcation membrane system also displayed GPIIb-IIIa labeling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that GPIIb-IIIa is present on the internal face of the alpha-granule membranes of platelets (where it appears early during MK maturation) as well as in the abnormal alpha-granules of gray platelets; it is absent from GT type I platelets.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a multifunctional protein specific to platelets, synthesized in megakaryocytes and stored in alpha granules. This report of our work shows that PF4 potently inhibits human megakaryocyte colony formation in vitro. Colony formation by megakaryocyte progenitor cells from normal bone marrows was studied using the plasma clot culture system and indirect immunoperoxidase staining. Nonadherent mononuclear cells were co-cultured with various concentrations (0 to 20 micrograms/mL) of highly purified human PF4. Statistically significant inhibition of three classes of megakaryocyte progenitor cells, the mixed colony forming unit-megakaryocytes (mCFU-MK), the burst forming unit-megakaryocytes (BFU-MK), and the colony forming unit-megakaryocytes (CFU-MK), was seen at a PF4 concentration of 2.5 micrograms/mL or greater. PF4 had no effect on erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) colony formation except at high concentration (5 micrograms/mL for BFU-E and 10 micrograms/mL for CFU-GM). When a concentration of 5 micrograms/mL PF4 was added at various time points during marrow culture, a reduction of megakaryocyte colony formation also occurred. In the presence of PF4 2.5 micrograms or 5 micrograms/mL, the percentage of mature type of colonies was found to be decreased compared with cultures with no added PF4. These data demonstrate that PF4 inhibits both proliferation and maturation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells in vitro and suggest that PF4 may play a role in autoregulating human megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Hematopoietic stem cells were purified from murine bone marrow cells (BMC). Their characteristic density, size, internal complexity, Hoechst 33342 dye uptake, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) affinity were used to distinguish them from other cells in the bone marrow. BMC suspensions were centrifuged over Ficoll Lymphocyte Separation Media (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC; density 1.077 to 1.08). The lower-density cells were drawn off, stained with Hoechst and labeled with biotinylated WGA bound to streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (WGA-B*A-PE) or with WGA conjugated to Texas Red. These cells were then analyzed and sorted by an Ortho Cytofluorograph 50-H cell sorter. The cells exhibiting medium to high forward light scatter, low to medium right angle light scatter, low Hoechst intensity, and high WGA affinity were selected. Sorted BMC (SBMC) were stained with Romanowsky-type stains for morphologic assay, and were assayed in lethally irradiated (LI) mice for their ability to produce colony-forming units in the spleen (CFU-S) and for their ability to produce survival. The spleen seeding factor for day 8 CFU-S upon retransplantation of the isolated cells was 0.1. The isolated cells were found to have consistent morphology, were enriched up to 135-fold as indicated by day 8 CFU-S assay, 195-fold as indicated by day 14 CFU-S assay, and 150 sorter-selected BMC were able to produce long-term survival in LI mice with retention of donor karyotype. When recipients of this first transplantation were themselves used as BMC donors, their number of day 8 and day 12 CFU-S were found to be reduced. However, 3 X 10(5) of their BMC provided 100% survival among secondary recipients. When the previously SBMC were competed after one transplantation against fresh nonsorted BMC in a mixed donor transplant, they showed the decline in hematopoietic potency normally seen in previously transplanted BMC. We conclude that the use of combinations of vital dyes for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) selection of survival-promoting murine hematopoietic stem cells provides results comparable with those produced by antibody-selected FACS and has the advantage of a method directly transferable to human BMC.\r"

The osteopetrosis of mi/mi mice can be cured by bone marrow transplantation from congenic normal (+/+) mice, and therefore, the cause of the osteopetrosis is attributed to a defect of osteoclasts. Since both osteoclasts and mast cells are the progeny of multipotential hematopoietic stem cells, we examined whether mast cells were defective in mi/mi mice. In spite of the deficiency of mast cells in tissues of mi/mi mice, mast cells did develop when spleen cells of mi/mi mice were cultured with pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell conditioned medium (PWM-SCM). The proliferative response of cultured mast cells (CMC) derived from mi/mi mice to PWM-SCM was comparable with that of CMC from +/+ mice. In contrast, when CMC were co-cultured with the NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line in culture medium lacking PWM-SCM, only +/+ CMC entered into the S phase of the cell cycle and were maintained; mi/mi CMC gradually disappeared. Moreover, fibroblasts derived from the skin of mi/mi mice normally supported the proliferation of +/+ CMC. Thus, the mast cell deficiency of mi/mi mice appears to be due to the inability of mi/mi mast cells to respond to the proliferative stimulus presented by fibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "A human megakaryoblastic cell line, designated CHRF-288-11, has been established in vitro through the use of adherent stromal cells in long-term human bone marrow culture. Long-term bone marrow cultures were required for the initial adaptation of the megakaryoblastic cells to culture conditions; however, once adapted, the cells were weaned from the stromal layer until they proliferated in the complete absence of any feeder layers. The seed cells for the establishment of this line were derived from a solid tumor; the cloned cell line derived from this tumor exhibits markers characteristic of megakaryocytes and platelets. Specifically, the cells express platelet peroxidase, platelet factor 4, and platelet Ca+(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (CDw41), factor VIII antigen, and the MY7 (CD13) and MY9 (CD33) antigens. The cells do not express the erythroid markers glycophorin A and hemoglobin, the myeloid marker myeloperoxidase, nor markers specific for T and/or B cells. The established cell line produces both basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta, properties demonstrated previously for the solid tumor. The clonal cell population exhibited a unique, singular karyotype, indicating cellular homogeneity. The cells display a doubling time of approximately 33 hours in either 25% horse or calf serum. Treatment of the cells with 1 X 10(-8) mol/L phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) leads to the induction of multi-nucleation and hyperploidy in the cells, with approximately 35% of the cells exhibiting two or more nuclei per cell, and greater than 80% of the cells enlarging in size. The establishment of this unique cell line under defined culture conditions will be beneficial for the future study of megakaryocytic properties expressed by this cell line.\r"

These 11 patients represented 13% of a well-characterized cohort of 87 HIV + hemophiliacs. ITP developed a mean 3.5 years after seroconversion, mean platelet count at presentation was 36,000/microL (range 15,000 to 49,000/microL), and the mean age at seroconversion was 37.1 years. Nine patients (82%) suffered bleeding complications, including four with intracranial hemorrhage, which was fatal in three. At the onset of ITP, five had AIDS and six were asymptomatic. Mean T4 lymphocyte count at onset of ITP was 126 +/- 32/microL (range 5 to 267/microL). Sustained treatment responses occurred with intravenous gammaglobulin (2 of 2), one of whom spontaneously remitted, and with zidovudine (1 of 2), but not with steroids (0 of 6) or danazol (0 of 3). In conclusion, 13% of a cohort of HIV + hemophiliacs has developed ITP with platelets less than 50,000/microL, a significant proportion of whom (82%) have experienced bleeding complications. It is recommended that treatment for ITP in HIV + hemophiliacs be instituted once the platelet count falls below 50,000/microL in order to avoid serious hemorrhagic sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet calpain has many platelet substrates, including external membrane proteins. We thus investigated whether platelet calpain II was associated with platelet membranes in unstimulated and thrombin-activated platelets. A monospecific, goat polyclonal antibody was reared to purified platelet calpain II. Sixteen whole platelet lysates were found to contain 4.5 +/- 0.7 micrograms calpain antigen II per 10(8) platelets (mean +/- SEM) as determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using the dipeptide fluorogenic substrate, Suc-Leu-Tyr-MCA, 17 human platelet lysates contained 3.6 +/- 0.4 micrograms calpain activity per 10(8) platelets. Platelet calpain II was associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble platelet cytoskeletons from both unstimulated and thrombin-activated platelets. When compared with the total cell content of platelet calpain II, calpain antigen (10% to 13%) and calpain activity (24% to 28%) was associated with platelet cytoskeletons in unstimulated and thrombin-activated platelets, respectively. On immunoblot, the heavy chain (80 Kd) of calpain II was detected in platelet cytoskeletons. Subcellular fractionation studies on both unstimulated and thrombin-activated platelets, revealed that half of the total platelet calpain II antigen was associated with cytosol, and the other half was associated with the membrane fraction. Platelet calpain II was not seen on the surface of unstimulated, paraformaldehyde fixed platelets by immunofluorescence. However, on thrombin-activated platelets, rim immunofluorescence was seen, indicating that activated platelets externalize their calpain. This observation was confirmed by the finding that about 2,000 molecules per platelet of an 125I-anti-calpain II Fab' specifically bound to thrombin-activated but not unstimulated platelets. Both dibucaine (1 mmol/L) and platelet activating factor (1.86 mumol/L) in the absence of external Ca++, but not collagen (5 micrograms/mL) or ionophore A23187 (2.5 mumol/L) in the absence of external Ca++, were also able to externalize platelet calpain II antigen, as indicated by a similar level of specific 125I-anti-calpain II Fab'-platelet binding. These combined studies indicate that platelet calpain II is a major protein, comprising 2% of total platelet protein, a substantial portion of which is membrane-associated. When platelets are activated by thrombin and platelet activating factor, calpain II antigen also becomes present on the external platelet surface.\r"

  ".U": "90181615\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, the full-length primary amino acid sequence for human glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa have been derived from their respective cDNAs. Potential functional domains within these proteins have been proposed based primarily on homology with similar domains in other proteins having known biologic function. To further understand the relationship between structure and function of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, we have begun comparative studies of the human GPIIb/IIIa receptor with the corresponding rodent receptor. The rodent rGPIIb/IIIa receptor differs from the human receptor, having low affinity for R.G.D-containing oligopeptides and not binding at all to the C-terminus of the gamma chain of human fibrinogen. We describe the structure of rodent platelet GPIIb derived from a combination of peptide sequencing, and cDNA and partial genomic DNA sequence analysis. The initial transcript is 1037 amino acid residues, having 78% amino acid identity with its 1039 residue human analog. Both heavy chains have the N-terminal sequence L.N.L.D, agreeing with the consensus derived from other integrin family alpha heavy chains. All 18 cysteine residues occur at positions conserved in human GPIIb and the vitronectin receptor alpha subunit VNR alpha. The putative calcium-binding domains of the GPIIbs have a high level of amino acid identity (92%), supporting the supposition that these regions have a critical biologic role. The final 48 C-terminal amino acid residues of the heavy chain of rodent GPIIb share only 56% identity with its human counterpart, and the proposed cleavage site of human GPIIb into its heavy and light chains is not present in the rodent sequence. Although we demonstrate that rodent GPIIb is split into two subunits during its maturation, this process either involves a different recognition sequence in the rodent or occurs at a different site. Finally, partial genomic DNA sequence analysis indicates that there are at least two rodent GPIIb genes: a normal gene, containing introns in positions similar to those in the human gene, and a processed pseudogene. The human haploid genome contains only a single GPIIb gene.\r"

No molecular abnormality of KGN was detected in the DNA from four patients with total KGN deficiency or one patient with isolated HMW-KGN deficiency. In the former, the KGN gene appeared to be grossly normal at the level of the whole genome on Southern blotting. In isolated HMW-KGN deficiency, a partial deletion in intron 7 was found by restriction analyses of EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, Sca I, and Bgl II fragments. This partial deletion is assumed to be related to an abnormality of the alternative RNA splicing events for HMW-prekininogen mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "90181618\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine produced in monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes, is induced by a variety of stimulating signals, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly (I), poly (C), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and platelet-derived growth factor. Some of these signals induce IL-6 effectively only in one cell type, and this selectivity of induction may explain selectivity of biologic effects. In the present study, we show that IL-1 beta, previously known to be a potent inducer of IL-6 in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes, but not in monocytes, is also a potent inducer of IL-6 in peripheral blood monocytes. High level IL-6 activity that could be neutralized by specific antibodies to IL-6 was detected in supernatants of IL-1-stimulated monocytes. Maximal induction required IL-1 concentrations of 10 ng/mL. As judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, IL-6 species of relative molecular mass of 19 to 26 Kd could be specifically immunoprecipitated from supernatants of IL-1-induced monocytes. Size heterogeneity is a reported feature of IL-6 produced in a variety of cell types, and monocyte-derived IL-6 induced by either IL-1 or LPS displayed similar size heterogeneity. The highly purified recombinant IL-1 beta preparation used contained little, if any, LPS. In addition, monocyte production of IL-6, induced by IL-1 beta, was specifically neutralized by anti-IL-1 beta antibodies, demonstrating that IL-1, rather than a contaminant in the IL-1 preparation, was responsible for IL-6 induction. A number of biologic activities have been ascribed both to IL-1 and IL-6. The finding that IL-1 induced IL-6 in monocytes may help in defining the spectrum of biologic activities of each of these interactive cytokines.\r"

We report the establishment of five representative cell lines from high grade NHL-B using B-cell growth factor (BCGF). The five NHL-B cell lines display the morphologic, immunophenotypic, genotypic, and biologic characteristics of the lymphoma cells present in the original diagnostic specimen. The cell lines showed at least a sevenfold dose-dependent increase in proliferation in vitro over background in the presence of BCGF. Other putative B-cell growth-stimulating cytokines showed no significant proliferative activity or were inhibitory in some cases. NHL-B cell lines secreted growth factor(s) into culture supernatants that mediated at least a fivefold dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation in autochthonous lymphoma cells and a 10-fold or greater stimulation in growth factor-dependent normal B cell lines in vitro. The cell lines show monoclonal rearrangements of IgH genes and nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities characteristic of NHL-B, while the expression of Epstein-Barr virus associated antigen (EBNA-I) is present in two of the five cell lines. The studies show that lineage-specific growth factors may be used to establish neoplastic B cell lines in vitro, which are important experimental systems for cellular and molecular studies in the NHL-B.\r"

We studied the effects of bryostatin 1 on the growth of human leukemias in vitro. Bryostatin 1 inhibited 1 to 4 logs of clonogenic leukemia cell growth from three of four leukemia cell lines. Bryostatin 1 also inhibited, by at least 1 log, the proliferation of clonogenic acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) cells from 10 to 12 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed ANLL. Maximal inhibition of leukemic growth occurred at 10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L bryostatin 1. Interestingly, bryostatin 1 also inhibited the growth of hematopoietic progenitors from eight patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Leukemia cells exposed to bryostatin 1 for up to 96 hours and then washed, demonstrated no substantial inhibition of clonogenic growth, indicating that the anti-leukemic effect of bryostatin 1 is cytostatic. The phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) produced more potent inhibition of clonogenic leukemia growth, and this inhibition was blocked by bryostatin 1. Thus, the anti-leukemic activity of bryostatin 1 may be mediated through activation of protein kinase C. Bryostatin 1 inhibits clonogenic leukemia cells at concentrations that stimulate normal hematopoietic progenitors. The differential effects of bryostatin 1 on normal and abnormal hematopoiesis suggest that bryostatin 1 may have value in the treatment of leukemias and MDS.\r"

The creation of transgenic mice that express human beta-globin (beta s) has provided an opportunity to study the effect of increasing the non-alpha-globin chain production on the thalassemic phenotype. A small increase in beta-globin production produces transgenic mice that are healthier, have almost normal hemoglobin values, and whose red blood cell deformability is increased. We quantified and characterized the membrane skeletal-associated globin in normal, transgenic thal/sickle, and thalassemic mice and showed that only alpha-globin was associated with the membrane skeleton in the pathologic red blood cells, and that the degree of rigidity as measured in the rheoscope correlated directly and closely with the amount of membrane skeletal-associated globin in these abnormal red blood cells.\r"

In contrast, membranes of erythrocytes from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) contained the 67 Kd protein even when prepared in the absence of Ca2+, as well as the antibody-reactive proteins of 35 and 38 Kd. When prepared in the presence of Ca2+, CML membranes contained increased levels of these three species and the 48 Kd protein, as well. These results suggest that normal erythrocytes contain a calcimedin-like protein that is translocated to the membrane in the presence of Ca2+ and that CML erythrocytes have both an abnormal amount and distribution of calcimedin-like proteins.\r"

Forty patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) received cytoreduction followed by BMT with HLA-matched T cell-depleted allogeneic marrow. The remaining 24 patients were transplanted in second chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase, or received T cell-depleted grafts with a dose of T cells added back. The Y chromosome and autosomal heteromorphisms were used to distinguish between donor and host cells. Mixed hematopoietic chimerism (presence of donor and host cells) was identified in 90% of patients in first CP. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome reappeared in 16 of the 40 first CP CML patients. As expected, patients who had detectable Ph chromosome positive cells at any time during the posttransplant period had a high likelihood of subsequent clinical relapse. Transient disappearance of the Ph positive clone was rarely observed, and was followed by reappearance of the Ph chromosome or clinical relapse. A subset of engrafted patients with greater than 25% host cells within 3 months post-BMT had a significantly shorter survival time free of cytogenetic or clinical relapse compared with other patients. In patients who had received donor T cells added to the T cell-depleted graft, there was a higher proportion of complete chimerism. Clonal progression of Ph positive as well as negative cells was observed and may be the result of radiation induced breakage. Serial cytogenetic studies of patients post-BMT can provide useful information regarding the biologic and clinical behavior of CML.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty consecutive patients were transplanted with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling marrow for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, N = 29), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL, N = 23), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, N = 28). Donor marrow was depleted of lymphocytes using counterflow centrifugation. Median age of the recipients was 31 years. Pretransplant conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) with a low (4.1 +/- 0.3 cGy/min) or high (13.1 +/- 1.6 cGy/min) midline average dose rate. In 43 patients, cytosine-arabinoside or anthracyclines were added to the conditioning regimen. Immunoprophylaxis posttransplant consisted of methotrexate (MTX) alone, cyclosporine A (CsA) in combination with MTX, or CsA alone; two patients received no immunoprophylaxis at all. Graft failure occurred in 4 of 77 evaluable patients (5%). The probability of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade 2 at day 100 after transplantation was 15%. The projected 3-year estimate of extensive chronic GVHD was 12%. Only three patients died of cytomegalovirus-interstitial pneumonitis. The projected 3-year probability of relapse was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], range 8% to 53%) in transplants for AML in first complete remission (CR1), 35% (95% CI, 1% to 69%) after transplantation for ALL in CR1, and 38% (95% CI, 2% to 74%) after transplantation for CML in first chronic phase (CP1). The projected 3-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 56% (95% CI, 35% to 77%) after transplantation for AML-CR1, 42% (95% CI, 16% to 69%) in patients transplanted for ALL-CR1, and 49% (95% CI, 18% to 80%) after transplantation for CML-CP1. After transplantation for AML-CR1, ALL-CR1, or CML-CP1, the median follow-up time for leukemia-free survivors was 31+, 30+, and 21+ months, respectively. Probabilities of relapse, survival, and LFS in AML-CR1 and ALL-CR1 transplants were comparable with those reported in recipients of untreated grafts. In patients transplanted for CML-CP1, probability of relapse was higher and probability of LFS was lower than in recipients of untreated grafts. In transplants for leukemia in CR1 and CP1, preparative regimen and immunoprophylaxis posttransplant were not associated significantly with the probability of acute GVHD greater than or equal to grade 2, extensive chronic GVHD, relapse, survival, or LFS. In bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, counterflow centrifugation is a useful technique for the prevention of GVHD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Since LAK cells are sustained by interleukin-2 (IL-2), we also investigated the ability of post-BMT T cells to produce IL-2. These functions were investigated at the clonal level. More than 200 T-cell clones from six long-term BMT recipients were generated and compared with 60 T-cell clones derived from two normal controls. Almost all the CD8+ clonal cultures from BMT recipients expressed cytolytic activity in a lectin-dependent cellular cytoxicity assay. Interestingly, a higher proportion of BMT recipient-derived cytolytic clones were able to mediate LAK activity in comparison with control clones (28% versus 4%, P less than .05). However, T-cell clones from BMT recipients, as opposed to control clones, were largely incapable of producing IL-2. Given the high proportions of post-BMT circulating CD8+ T cells, it appears that, in long-term BMT recipients, the precursors of nonspecific LAK effectors are present at above normal levels. However, their function may be defective in vivo due to poor IL-2 production.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we have decreased the number of bone marrow (BM) lymphocytes in the donor marrow graft before bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using counterflow centrifugal elutriation (CCE). In a phase I-II clinical trial, 23 patients received lymphocyte-depleted BM allografts from their HLA-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC)-nonreactive sibling donors. The patients entered in the study were deemed to be at high risk for treatment failure on the basis of age (greater than 30 years; median, 39 years) and the result of our skin explant assay predictive of acute GVHD. Patients predicted not to develop acute GVHD by this assay were excluded from this study. All patients received a standard lymphocyte dose of 0.5 x 10(6) morphologic lymphocytes per kilogram ideal body weight (IBW) in the marrow graft and were maintained on cyclosporine A (CsA) immunosuppression for 170 days after BMT. Prompt hematopoietic recovery occurred in 22 of 23 patients with a median time to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 500/microL of 21 days. Donor cell engraftment was subsequently verified by cytogenetic and/or DNA analysis in all of 21 evaluable patients. No patient developed systemic acute GVHD. Only five (22%) developed cutaneous GVHD (clinical stage 1) that required steroid treatment, including one patient who failed to engraft. The median follow-up of the patients enrolled in this study is 14 months (range, 5 to 20 months). Actuarial survival 1 year after BMT is 83%. Thus, in two consecutive clinical trials using CCE to deplete donor BM of alloreactive lymphocytes (1.0 x 10(6) versus 0.5 x 10(6) lymphocytes/kg), we have demonstrated that the procedure does not interfere with BM engraftment and is effective in decreasing the incidence and severity of acute GVHD. Furthermore, comparison of these studies has revealed a differential dose response relationship between the number of graft lymphocytes, protection of engraftment, and induction of acute GVHD. Although there appears to be a modest relationship between lymphocyte dose and time to hematopoietic recovery, the 50% reduction in lymphocyte dose from that used in our previous trial resulted in a marked decrease in acute GVHD without compromising engraftment.\r"

The N stage, T stage and the characteristics (size and degree of fixation) of the neck nodes involved were found to be significant prognostic factors determining the development of distant metastasis. The bilaterality of neck node involvement, sex, age, haemoglobin and white blood count at diagnosis were not significant. The discriminating effect of N stage holds true in patient groups stratified for the node size and degree of fixation. The superiority of the Ho stage classification was confirmed. The high incidence of distant failure in patients with T3, N3, or bulky or fixed neck node involvement warrants further clinical trials to explore the role of adjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "90182046\r", 
  ".W": "It is now recognized that clonogenic tumour cells may repopulate vigorously during radiotherapy. Gaps in treatment schedules which lead to prolongation of overall treatment time may therefore cause sparing of tumour. Acute-responding normal tissues will also be spared if repopulation by surviving stem cells takes place. However, it is unlikely that stem cells in late-responding normal tissues repopulate significantly over the time-scale of a conventional treatment regime; these tissues will therefore experience little or no sparing as a result of a gap. This poses a dilemma since tumour cell repopulation implies that an increased therapeutic effect in the post-gap phase of treatment may be necessary to compensate for any prolongation of treatment time, but it is difficult to achieve increased tumour effect without also increasing damage to late-responding normal tissues. Neither increased total dose nor increased fraction size is able to achieve this. A possible solution is provided if total treatment time can be held constant, with unchanged total dose and fraction size, by use of twice-daily conventionally sized dose fractions administered after the gap. Provided the twice-daily fractions are sufficiently spaced (not less than 6-8 h apart), the result will be to offset repopulation in tumour and acute-responding normal tissues without additional impairment of late-responding normal tissues. The feasibility of the approach depends on being able to complete treatment by the time originally intended; it is therefore more readily applicable to gaps occurring early rather than late in a treatment schedule. The strategy should be especially advantageous for tumours with rapid repopulative potential in sites where risk of damage to late-responding normal tissues imposes limitation of dose.\r"

  ".U": "90182047\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of hypoxia and low pH in tumours is known to influence several treatment modalities including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hyperthermia. Hypoxic and acidic regions have been demonstrated in tumours using pH and pO2 microelectrodes. The technique has shown marked heterogeneity within individual tumours. A non-invasive measure of intracellular pH is provided by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy from determination of the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate, and is being increasingly applied to the study of human tumours in vivo. Based upon the assumption that hypoxic cells are also acidic, we have assessed the ability of a whole-body NMR spectrometer to detect acidic subpopulations within a tumour using simulated tumour spectra. In these simulations the size of the acidic subpopulation, assigned pH values from 5.0 to 7.0, was varied between 5% and 50% of the neutral \"control\" population. Gaussian noise was added to the simulated spectra giving signal-to-noise ratios for the neutral control inorganic phosphate peak of 3, 5 and 7, which are typical of values encountered in human tumour measurements. From the results of the simulations it seems unlikely that human hypoxic, and presumably acidic, cell fractions, typically 1-15%, will be detected by this method in the presence of signal-to-noise levels characteristic of current equipment. Therefore, whole-body in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy may fail to identify significant pH heterogeneity within human tumours. Improvements in signal-to-noise and line separation owing to improvements in technique and higher field strength instruments may improve sensitivity to heterogeneous populations.\r"

The maximal urethral pressure was 69.9% of the expected pressure and did not vary significantly in relation to the various balloon pressures. The mean maximal urethral pressure (+/- SEM) between the cuff when inflated and when deflated was also significantly different, although the absolute difference was small (14.1 cm H2O +/- 10.0). There was good correlation between maximal urethral pressure and urethral leakage pressure as measured by retrograde perfusion sphincterometry. The mean functional urethral length became significantly longer after implantation of the cuff. A combination of low urethral pressure and increased functional length may help to prevent cuff erosion and maintain continence.\r"

Balloon dilatation to 25 mm is not adequate therapy for bladder outflow tract obstruction or urinary retention from prostatic hypertrophy.\r"

The effects of surgery and infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on the level of anticoagulation were monitored. FFP reduced the prothrombin index by 0.25/unit. Transurethral resection can be carried out safely by an experienced urologist on patients anticoagulated with warfarin, reducing the risk of serious thromboembolic complications associated with withdrawal of anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 25 patients with strictures of the membranous urethra following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were investigated and treated initially by careful urethral dilatation. This controlled the stricture in 14 patients, 6 of whom continued with occasional dilatation or self-catheterisation to maintain control; 8 required an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) and 2 required a \"clam\" ileocystoplasty for detrusor instability. Eleven had persistent or recurrent strictures requiring urethroplasty. Nine underwent bulbo-prostatic anastomotic urethroplasty, 4 with simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction and 5 with subsequent implantation of an AUS; 2 had a preputial patch urethroplasty with subsequent implantation of an AUS. Four of the 9 patients with a urethroplasty and an AUS are satisfactory, 1 developed a recurrent stricture and 2 developed erosions. Two of those with a bulbo-prostatic anastomosis and bladder neck reconstruction are satisfactory and 2 are incontinent. These results were compared with those of 18 other patients who underwent bladder neck reconstruction and 12 who had a urethroplasty in conjunction with an AUS for reasons other than a post-TURP sphincter stricture. The success rate of bladder neck reconstruction was 55% and the success rate of urethroplasty in conjunction with an AUS was 83%, but the main complication of AUS implantation, erosion, was a more serious problem than failure of bladder neck reconstruction. However, the much higher success rate makes AUS implantation a more satisfactory procedure. Surgery should be avoided if at all possible and reliance placed on urethral dilatation.\r"

Partial, gradual disappearance of glans engorgement and irregularities palpable along the penile urethra associated with ventral curvature are constant findings. The post-manipulative ventral curvature can be transient, disappearing when the inflammatory process subsides or the repeated urethral manipulation ceases. Since fibrosis of the corpus spongiosum begins with urethral inflammation, patients in whom irregularities of the penile urethra are observed during urethrography should be questioned about any erectile deformity. Surgical treatment is indicated when the deformity interferes with sexual intercourse or is accompanied by severe urethral strictures.\r"

Two physicians assessed independently the position and motility of the testes of 37 boys referred for undescended testis. The boys were examined in the supine and squatting positions. The observed agreement rate between the observers was 0.90 to 0.97. Using kappa (kappa) statistics, the values were adjusted for the expected chance agreement; kappa values between 0.47 and 0.81 were obtained, slightly higher values for patients in the supine position. Complete agreement on all observations was reached in 13.5% of the patients. Inter-observer variation may be a substantial source of bias in diagnosing the undescended testis and one of the reasons for the varying results in studies of hormonal treatment of this condition. It is also a fact that the number of orchiopexies in some countries exceeds the incidence of this condition.\r"

Only patients with sterile urine pre-operatively were included in the study. All received antibiotic cover in the post-operative period. Positive urine cultures were found in only 3 patients (7.5%). In spite of this low incidence, the urine specimens collected from all children 1 month after removal of the stent showed a much higher incidence of infection. It was concluded that ureteric stenting is a safe procedure with a low rate of infection provided that antibiotic cover is given.\r"

Instability was not apparent in Group B at standard filling cystometry, but had to be elicited through aggressively stressing the bladder by provocation tests. In all women the acceleration of flow rate (a, in ml/s2) was calculated from free flow uroflowmetry as the ratio of peak flow divided by the time to peak flow. This parameter did not differ significantly in GSI patients when compared with controls but proved higher in the DI group than in either the controls or the GSI patients. It was concluded that measuring the acceleration of flow rate is a simple and reliable test which improves the accuracy of diagnosis of detrusor instability in stress incontinent women.\r"

The tumour specimens were fixed and stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. There was an area which could not be stained with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody surrounding the stained area where diffusion effects could be excluded. This indicates a growth fraction less than 1 and implies that a proportion of the tumour cells in bladder tumours are cycling and contributing to growth. The BrdU labelling index (growth fraction) was determined by counting the number of BrdU labelled cells in the well labelled tissue sections. The average growth fraction of invasive bladder cancer was 38.4 +/- 7.7% (range 26.9-48.1%). Grade 3 tumours averaged 42.8 +/- 5.4% labelling versus 31.0 +/- 4.4% in grade 2. The higher growth fraction may indicate greater biological malignancy. These results indicate that immunohistochemical studies of cell kinetics using BrdU monoclonal antibodies may provide information about the biological characteristics of bladder tumours in situ.\r"

The study showed that 65% of patients responded completely after 12 weekly instillations and 46% of these remained continuously free of disease for 5 years. An initial complete response to therapy and lower pathological grade seemed to indicate a long-term successful response to treatment. In patients who failed to respond by 1 year, further therapy was of no benefit. Clearance of bladder disease by 1 year carried a 14% risk of subsequent tumour invasion by 5 years. This risk increased to 75% in those who failed to respond by 1 year.\r"

  ".U": "90182131\r", 
  ".W": "The critical intravesical pressure range for extravascular absorption of irrigating fluid (EVA) during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is determined by the pressure in the perivesical tissue. This means that the transmural bladder pressure (detrusor pressure), calculated by deducting perivesical pressure from intravesical pressure during cystometry, is the pressure gradient behind EVA. The transmural pressure in 6 patients undergoing TURP has been studied both before and during epidural anaesthesia, using both conventional medium-fast fill cystometry and \"free-flow\" cystometry through the resectoscope. Epidural block does not influence the transmural pressure response on filling the bladder and neither does the type of infusion. A positive transmural pressure, and thereby a pressure gradient for EVA, exists already during the very early phase of bladder filling. Incomplete perforation of the prostatic capsule and clotting, as well as the accumulation of irrigating fluid in the perivesical tissue, probably moderate the rate of absorption.\r"

Each of the 4 parameters yielded an approximately equal increased risk of disease progression at 5 and 8 years. The occurrence of 2 or more risk factors in the same patient did not result in a statistically increased risk of progression at 5 and 8 years. The effect of capsular involvement on progression was directly related to the extent of invasion. The progression rate at 8 years was 3% for patients with mild involvement, 19% for those with extensive invasion and 50% for those with capsular penetration.\r"

In order to differentiate between vascular and non-vascular impotence, 5 micrograms PGE1 were found to be a sufficiently high and safe dose for the first intracavernous injection. Local discomfort, ranging from mild to severe pain after injection, was recorded in 40% of patients. A significant difference in severe side effects was found between arterial, venous and non-vasculogenic impotence, the highest incidence of local pain occurring in non-vasculogenic patients. The most striking result was the occurrence of 4 cases of priapism, all in the non-vascular group, 1 of these occurring after the injection of only 5 micrograms PGE1.\r"

A deficiency of penile shaft skin in association with abnormal mobility of the skin gives rise to the phenotypic appearance. The skin defect may be related to an abnormal attachment of dartos muscle during embryogenesis. Correction of this condition requires separation of these abnormal muscular attachments and provision of skin coverage of the penile shaft. It is imperative not to circumcise the patient as this will worsen the skin deficiency. We describe a novel technique for correcting buried penis performed on 12 patients at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. A satisfactory cosmetic result was obtained in all patients.\r"

Few significant differences were found across practice types in the presence of recall systems for screening or in knowledge of, compliance with or estimated coverage for selected preventive maneuvers recommended by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. CHCs reported a significantly greater variety of formal health promotion programs and a greater tendency to use nonphysician health care personnel to carry out both prevention and health promotion activities. The results must be interpreted with caution because of the use of self-reported data, the low response rate for FFS practices and the use of a restrictive definition of disease prevention tied to evidence from the reports of the task force. Thus, the results cast some doubt on the common assumption that increasing the population served by alternative modes of delivery such as HSOs and CHCs necessarily increases the level of disease prevention and health promotion activity.\r"

Outcome was evaluated prospectively, with a structured questionnaire, by telephone. During the visit pulsus paradoxus was documented in four patients. Spirometry was done in 63 patients; postbronchodilator values ranged from 0.9 to 4.1 L. A total of 92 patients received inhaled bronchodilator therapy, most by wet nebulization. Sixteen patients received anticholinergic agents and three received theophylline. Ingested corticosteroids were given to 27 patients. Of the 71 patients contacted, a mean of 12 days after the visit, 26 (37%) had sought further medical attention, 19 at the emergency department; 9 had required admission. Forty-six patients reported that their condition had improved, but over 60% continued to have cough, sputum production, nocturnal waking and early-morning chest tightness. The results indicate that asthma continues to be undertreated in the emergency department and highlight the importance of routine spirometry in all patients and the need for systemic corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Forty patients entered the study and 39 were evaluable for clinical response and toxicity. The infusion technique was done in two consecutive series of patients with the same characteristics: 17 had treatment with vincristine, bleomycin, and methotrexate (VBM), and 22 received cisplatin and bleomycin (PB) with a median number of six and five cycles, respectively. The total objective response (OR) rate was 76.9%, which included 12.8% of complete response (CR). A better percentage of OR was attained in BCC than SCC (83.3% versus 75.8%), in tumors of the skin of the face than other sites (87.5% versus 74.2%), and in the group that received PB than the group that received VBM (77.3% versus 76.5%). Our series had an overall technique-related toxicity of 18%; 10.3% with neurologic disturbances and 7.7% with skin inflammation (almost all were reversible). The most common systemic toxic side effects were generally mild and well tolerated (30.8%), whereas major toxicities (severe modifications of the cardiopulmonary function) occurred in four patients (10.3%) in the group that received VBM. After chemotherapy, 28 patients (71.8%) were deemed resectable; 23 of these patients (82.1%) agreed to surgery. Pathologic CR were obtained in 13 patients (56.5%). Our technique has significant advantages over the conventional methods of infusion, because tumor perfusion is feasible and selective, technique-related and catheter-related complications are almost completely eliminated, and fatal drug-related side effects are avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients with advanced gastric cancer and measurable areas of malignant disease were treated with etoposide (130 mg/m2/day X 3 days) plus cisplatin (45 mg/m2day on days 2 and 3). Both drugs were given by constant intravenous infusion and repeated every 4 weeks. Common toxic reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most patients experienced severe but reversible toxic reactions. In 46 evaluable patients an overall objective regression rate of 28% was obtained with a median duration of regression of 4 months. Regression rates were only modestly reduced among patients with prior chemotherapy exposure (21%). Whereas this combination of etoposide and cisplatin does not appear to offer any major advantage over other single and combination regimens in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, it shows definite activity and its lack of cross-resistance with other commonly used agents for this disease could indicate a possible role in new combination or sequential chemotherapy approaches. As an interesting sidelight, we found that 21% of our patients had elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels, and among this group regression rates were higher than in HCG-negative patients. It would be of interest to extend these observations in other gastric carcinoma studies involving cisplatin regimens.\r"

With regard to treatment response and survival, 345 patients could be evaluated. Carcinoma of the lung (19%), prostate (18%), breast (13%), and kidney (10%) were the most frequent primary malignancies causing spinal compression. The outcome of treatment depended primarily on the patients' condition at the time of diagnosis: 79% of the patients who were able to walk before the treatment remained ambulatory, whereas only 21% of the nonambulatory paraplegic patients and 6% of the paralytic patients regained walking ability. Patients treated with laminectomy followed by radiotherapy seemed to respond better than patients treated with radiotherapy or laminectomy alone, but when the patients' pretreatment motor function was taken into account no significant difference was found between the three forms of treatment. In the subgroup of nonambulatory patients, however, a significantly better restoration of gait was observed in patients treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone. A longer survival in the group treated with the combination of laminectomy and radiotherapy may reflect that these patients were in a lower stage of disease and thus had a better potential of regaining motor function. The results call for prospective randomized studies.\r"

  ".W": "From 1970 to 1986, 304 patients underwent limb salvage resections for 271 malignant and 33 benign tumors of the extremities. Reconstruction was with a prosthesis or nonbiologic spacer. Nonmechanical complications were analyzed to determine the influence of the site and method of reconstruction and the use of chemotherapy on their incidence and severity. There were 82 shoulder resections, 53 proximal femur resections, and 169 knee resections. No chemotherapy was used in 115 patients; neoadjuvant therapy was used in 128 patients and adjuvant therapy was used in 61. There were 120 complications. The most common complication was infection (36 of 304 patients; 11.8%), which led to amputation in eight patients. Resections about the knee led to more complications than the other sites, particularly if reconstructed with a large cement spacer. Patients who did not receive any chemotherapy had a 25.2% (29 of 115) incidence of complications and those who received adjuvant treatment had a 32.8% (20 of 61) incidence. This compares with a 55.4% (71 of 128) incidence in the neoadjuvant group. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, reconstruction with an uncemented prosthesis led to the fewest complications.\r"

  ".W": "Nine hundred thirty-two patients with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas were seen at the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Radiology of the University of Essen, Essen, Germany, between 1970 and 1986. In addition to standard treatment by surgery, radioactive iodine and medical thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, 346 patients had received conventional external irradiation to the neck (mostly 40-60 Gy) before referral to our institutions, whereas 586 patients had not received radiotherapy. From the follow-up data of these patients, survival rates were calculated separately for tumor Stages T1 (n = 203), T2 (n = 552), and T3/T4 (n = 277) using life-table analysis. Distribution of risk factors (histologic type of tumor, grading of malignancy, presence of distant metastases, age and sex) was similar in all groups with the one exception, that the radiotherapy patients with Stage T3/T4 were older. There was no significant difference in the life expectancy of irradiated and not irradiated patients by Breslow and Mantel-Cox tests. In Stages T1, T2, and T3/T4, 75% of the radiotherapy patients survived for 10.6 +/- 0.32, 11.5 +/- 0.61, and 6.71 +/- 0.85 years, respectively; the figures for the nonirradiated patients were 9.4 +/- 0.17, 10.8 +/- 0.37, and 6.26 +/- 0.51 years, respectively. When survival rates were calculated separately for patients with Stage T3/T4 older and younger than 40 years, there was no obvious effect of radiotherapy in the younger group, whereas in the older patients, improvement of survival by radiation just failed to reach statistical significance (P less than 0.09). In conclusion, this retrospective analysis failed to prove that survival is prolonged in patients with differentiated carcinoma by administration of conventional external radiotherapy after surgery. A benefit to older patients with locally advanced tumors has still to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Eight of 28 (28%) cancer patients with liver metastases treated by either splenic (four) or hepatic (four) arterial infusion of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) developed hypersensitivity reactions to iodine-containing radiographic contrast media. These reactions consisted of fever, chills, malaise, nausea and vomiting, skin rash, diarrhea, and occasionally, hypotension. Reactions usually occurred 1 month after the initial arteriographic procedure and rIL-2 infusion, with 1-hour to 4-hour intervals between procedure and reexposure of the patient to the iodine-containing contrast medium (used in conjunction with computerized tomography or repeated arteriography for subsequent courses of rIL-2 infusions) and the onset of symptoms. Prompt administration of corticosteroids during the reaction and premedication of patients who were known to have had a reaction in the past were very effective in stopping reactions or preventing them from reoccurring. The high incidence (28%) of hypersensitivity reactions, the temporal relationship (4 hours) between the arteriographic procedure (utilizing iodine-containing contrast medium) and the initial infusion of rIL-2 (while some of the contrast medium was still present), and the absence of such hypersensitivity reactions among patients receiving systemic (intravenous) rIL-2 (not requiring the use of concomitant iodine-containing contrast medium) provide additional evidence that in the presence of a potentially immunogenic moiety, rIL-2, a potent stimulant of the human immune system, can produce an initial sensitization followed by subsequent anamnestic reaction upon reexposure of the patient to the immunogen (even without the additional rIL-2).\r"

  ".W": "A 57-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia (ET) developed myelofibrosis, that progressed to a blastic transformation state. The characteristics of the blastic cells were serially studied both morphologically and phenotypically as well as in cell culture. The blastic cells that were first detected in peripheral blood had features of myeloid stem cells with slight differentiation toward megakaryocytic lineage. However, later in the course, most of the blastic cells were immature. During culture in the presence of human plasma-derived serum (PDS), some blastic cells obtained at the initial stage differentiated, mainly to both granulocytes and macrophages morphologically, but later tended to differentiate into both megakaryocytes and macrophages. Finally the blasts appeared to have lost their ability to differentiate morphologically. However, the blasts formed mixed colonies consisting of erythroblasts, granulocytes, macrophages, and immature blasts when cultured in methylcellulose with PHA-leukocyte conditioned medium. In addition, the blastic cells in suspension culture strongly expressed phenotypic features which are characteristic of erythroblasts, in the presence of both PDS and 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), whereas they expressed features of megakaryoblasts in the presence of PDS alone. These results suggest that essential thrombocythemia is of myeloid stem cell origin. This is the first case in the literature in which a clonal evolution in ET has been followed closely, essential events were identified serially, and the blastic cells, which appeared as a result of the progression of ET, were found to have the capability to differentiate toward the three myeloid lineages.\r"

  ".W": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the only tumor marker of proven, although limited, value for the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The authors have prospectively assessed the potential value of a new tumor marker, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC Ag), in a large series of patients with advanced lung cancer (LC). Squamous cell carcinoma antigen and CEA levels were measured in 382 healthy persons (N1 group), 90 patients with benign pulmonary diseases, and 291 patients with LC (129 with SCLC and 162 with NSCLC, including 96 with squamous LC). Carcinoembryonic antigen levels were higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, but smoking habits did not influence the serum concentrations of SCC Ag. Elevated values (above the 95th percentiles of N1, i.e., 7.5 ng/ml for CEA and 3.0 ng/ml for SCC Ag) were observed in 11.1% of patients with benign pulmonary diseases for both markers. Carcinoembryonic antigen was more sensitive than SCC Ag, even for squamous LC (56% versus 35% of elevated values, P less than 0.01). The specificity toward squamous LC was better, however, for SCC Ag, for which levels were elevated in only 8.5% of SCLC and in 18% of other forms of NSCLC, compared with 49% and 55%, respectively, for CEA. Moreover, measurement of SCC Ag and CEA levels did not give redundant information: thus, in squamous LC and SCC Ag level was elevated in 32% of the patients with a normal CEA level, increasing from 57% to 71% the proportion of patients with at least one elevated marker. Lastly, elevation of CEA or SCC Ag levels was an adverse prognostic factor in squamous LC (P = 0.05 for CEA; P = 0.07 for SCC Ag). In conclusion, SCC Ag appears to be worthwhile of further investigation in squamous LC. The authors found that this new marker provided additional information on CEA and that it was more specific for squamous LC than CEA.\r"

False-positive elevations of serum Span-1 levels were rather common in liver cirrhosis (53.8%) and chronic hepatitis (26.3%). The sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of this assay for pancreatic cancer, was 81.3%, 75.6%, and 76.5% against all subjects without pancreatic cancer, respectively. In comparison with other markers, sensitivity of Span-1 tended to be highest with similar specificity to those of CA19-9 and CEA. The Span-1 assay has a high sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic cancer. It is almost equivalent to CA19-9 assay. However, this assay is not specific for chronic liver diseases.\r"

The interpretation of stimulated test results was sometimes difficult: elevated basal levels without a significant increase after the injection of secretagogues; basal levels in the normal range with considerable increases after stimulation but not exceeding two or three times the upper limit of normal; elevated basal or stimulated CT levels that slowly decreased to normal or near-normal levels over relatively short periods of time.

  ".W": "To evaluate DNA content as an independent, long-term prognostic indicator in infiltrative, node-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast, flow cytometric DNA analyses were performed retrospectively in 165 patients. The exclusive use of paraffin-embedded tissue permitted the study of patients for whom 3 to 15 years' follow-up was available. Other investigators have shown a relationship between DNA nuclear content and well-known prognostic indicators of breast carcinoma, such as estrogen receptors, age, menopausal status, and stage of tumor. However, very few of these studies were based on patients with long-term clinical follow-up and investigated the independent prognostic value of DNA nuclear content. The frequency of aneuploidy in the patients in this study was 57%, with DNA indices ranging from 0.73 to 2.59. Survival in patients with localized breast carcinoma with DNA aneuploid tumors was 84.1% at 5 years and 75.5% at 10 years. Those with diploid tumors showed survival of 87.8% at 5 years and 73.4% at 10 years. These data show no independent prognostic value for DNA nuclear content. The relationship between DNA content, tumor histologic type, and age was also investigated. High-grade tumors were more often aneuploid. There was no association between DNA content and age. Of 165 patients, information regarding estrogen receptor status was available in only 77; 45% of those with aneuploid tumors and 35% with diploid tumors were estrogen receptor-negative. This difference was not significant. The authors conclude that simple determination of DNA ploidy fails to indicate prognosis for infiltrative, node-negative breast carcinoma.\r"

At endoscopic examination, characteristic \"volcano-like\" ulcers were noted. Clinical gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 30 of the necropsy cases, and in four cases the gastric metastases led to the patients' deaths. Tumors primary in the lung accounted for most of the metastases (55%), followed by other gastrointestinal malignancies. A correct diagnosis is important to direct therapy and is facilitated by the characteristic clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings.\r"

Overall, 56% of the patients had silent cirrhosis, but this occurred significantly more frequently among those born in areas of the world where HCC is common (64% compared with 36%), those who were HBsAg-seropositive (75% compared with 25%), and those who had cryptogenic cirrhosis (71% compared with 29%). Previously recognized (\"known\") cirrhosis was more common among those from low-incidence areas (52% compared with 36%) and the cause of the cirrhosis was more often alcoholic (44% compared with 10%). The clinical features at the time of presentation with HCC did not differ between the two groups. During the 10-year period of the study (1978 to 1988), 448 patients with HCC were seen (including those without cirrhosis and those in whom the presence or absence of cirrhosis could not be determined). Overall, therefore, cirrhosis was recognized before presentation with tumor in only 30% of the patients. The screening of cirrhotic patients can only have a limited impact on the early detection of HCC.\r"

This report presents the clinicopathologic and flow cytometric features of 17 cases of primary renal sarcoma (seven men and ten women, ages 28-69 years). Presenting symptoms included abdominal and back pain and hematuria. Stages at diagnosis were I, in three patients; II, five patients; III, two patients; and IV, two patients. Eight tumors were leiomyosarcoma, two malignant fibrous histiocytoma, one hemangiopericytoma, one fibrosarcoma, and five unclassified. Tumors measured 5.5 to 23 cm, seven contained marked nuclear pleomorphism, seven were extensively necrotic, and mitotic rate was 1 to 33 per 10 high-power fields. Seven tumors showed aneuploidy and five were diploid. Thirteen patients were dead of disease after a mean of 23 months and two were alive with known metastases at 29 and 33 months, respectively. Ploidy pattern and outcome or time to death were not correlated, but aneuploidy correlated with histologic grade, marked nuclear pleomorphism (P less than 0.05), extensive necrosis (p less than 0.01), and high mitotic rate (0.05 less than P less than 0.10). The authors conclude that although DNA ploidy does correlate with histologic grade, for primary renal sarcomas, whose prognosis in this series was extremely poor, it does not correlate with outcome.\r"

Patients were divided into those 15 to 34 years of age, and those older than 50 years. Older patients had higher rates of advanced stage and B symptoms (e.g., Stage IVB, 19.7% compared with 7.7%) and significantly higher rates of poor prognosis histologic types, odds ratio (OR) = 3.7. The older population with clinical stage (CS) I and II disease was also less likely to have received any of the selected staging procedures, bone marrow biopsy, lymphogram, or laparotomy (OR = 4.48). The two populations were equivalently understaged when CS was compared with pathologic stage (PS). In each category the older patients were more likely to have received no therapy; for PS I and II disease the OR for older patients compared with the younger patient was 2.14. When stratified by PS, B symptom status, histologic type, and treatment the older patients continued to show poorer 5-year survival by the life-table method. The authors' hypothesis--that older patients equivalently staged and treated would have no significant difference in long-term survival--was not substantiated by the data. However, in the analyses in which corrections for the known risk factors were made, the difference in survival was not as great as that in the crude, unstratified data. This study, as well as other recent studies utilizing smaller numbers of patients, finds age an independent predictor of poorer survival in HD patients.\r"

The distribution of lung cancers into histologic types varied with the age of the patients at the time of diagnosis. When 38 high-risk occupational groups were combined, the age-specific distribution of lung cancer into histologic types did not differ significantly from the corresponding distribution for other economically active men. Of individual occupational groups, young farmers had a higher RR of small cell carcinoma than older farmers or other economically active young men. Besides their high overall lung cancer risk, miners and quarriers had a very high risk of small cell carcinoma as compared with other economically active men. Servicemen and repairmen in the metal industry had a high risk of epidermoid carcinoma. Welders had a high risk of epidermoid carcinoma, but their risk of small cell carcinoma was lower than expected. There were no other excess risks of any histologic type of lung cancer attributable to occupational factors.\r"

Of active respondents (AR) attending two to five screening examinations, 1582 had received annual mammography (MA) and physical examination (PE) of the breasts and 548 received annual PE alone. Of 139 dropouts after the first screening, 105 received MA and PE and 34 received PE alone. Dropout respondents (DR) were significantly less likely than AR to report receiving very prompt (46% versus 66%), very courteous (73% versus 92%), or very competent examinations (74% versus 95%). Although 35% of those allocated to PE expressed disappointment with PE allocation compared with 9% of those allocated to MA, fewer of those allocated PE were prepared to accept MA in the future than those allocated MA (59% versus 73%). Of those who had MA, 36% reported moderate and 9% extreme discomfort from mammography. Almost half of each subgroup--MA allocations, PE allocations, and DR--preferred mammography every 2 to 3 years and 30% preferred mammography restricted to diagnostic purposes. Only 5% of AR reported anxiety after screening. National Breast Screening Study participation was a positive experience for 93%. An intention to do breast self-examination (BSE) was reported by 89% of AR and 79% of DR. Forgetfulness was a major impediment to BSE. Disincentives for screening were excessive distance to center, painful mammography, fear of radiation, lack of time, and preference for own physician. Convenient location, punctual appointments, and courteous and supportive staff should enhance screening compliance.\r"

First, 300 tubings of three different types were tested at the three distal injection sites. The contamination rate was 3.3 per cent at the injection site closest to the IV catheter and 0.3 per cent at the furthest. The presence of a check-valve did not affect the contamination rate. Second, 300 third injection sites fixed at a level equal to or above the IV catheter were tested. None of them was contaminated. Finally, in order to evaluate whether changing the needle alone could prevent the contamination of syringes, injections were made into a tubing where blood was flowing. Thirty-four per cent of the syringes tested positive for blood. We conclude that IV tubings have a significant contamination rate in usual practice. This rate decreases as the distance from the IV catheter increases. The use of the third site fixed at a level equal to or above the IV catheter carries a lower risk of contamination. Changing the needle alone is a useless procedure to prevent cross-contamination.\r"

The effect of epidural epinephrine on the plasma concentration of bupivacaine was also measured. Twenty patients with a history and/or ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia requiring PVS were randomly assigned to two groups. The patients were monitored with a modified V5 ECG, oscillometric BP monitor and a PA catheter. After control haemodynamic measurements, 12 ml of bupivacaine, 0.75 per cent, +/- epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1, was injected over five minutes into the epidural space at L3-4. Supine haemodynamic measurements were repeated at 15 and 45 min after injection. At 15 min after epidural injection, compared with control values, patients receiving epidural epinephrine showed a significantly greater decrease in mean blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, and a significantly greater increase in cardiac output than patients receiving plain epidural bupivacaine (79.3 +/- 11.6 per cent vs 94.6 +/- 16.8 per cent, 61.6 +/- 9.0 vs 91.6 +/- 19.2 per cent, 130.8 +/- 23 vs 105 +/- 20.8 per cent, respectively). These differences were not present at 45 min after epidural injection. Heart rate was not significantly different between groups at either time. The presence of epidural epinephrine reduced the peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine from 0.86 +/- 0.20 to 0.64 +/- 0.33 micrograms.ml-1 and increased the time to achieve this concentration from 16.1 +/- 11.2 to 33.7 +/- 20.1 min.\r"

Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained by either propofol (2.0-2.5 mg.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion 0.1-0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1) or thiopentone (4.0-5.0 mg.kg-1, and infusion rate 0.16-0.32 mg.kg-1.min-1), titrated to patient response. Succinylcholine was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation and maintain neuromuscular blockade. Induction of anaesthesia was slightly longer with propofol than thiopentone (42.2 vs 29.8 sec) and was smooth with both drugs. Post-intubation increases in heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were attenuated by propofol when compared with thiopentone. After the administration of propofol, times to eye opening (6.4 +/- 4.3 vs 13.9 +/- 15.9 min), response to verbal command (7.6 +/- 6.3 vs 15.4 +/- 16.6 min) and orientation (22.7 +/- 12.8 vs 36.2 +/- 23.1 min), were significantly shorter. Psychomotor and cognitive function returned earlier with propofol and fewer side effects were noted. At 24 hr there was no distinguishable difference between groups. Propofol is a safe anaesthetic agent with the potential for early patient discharge and street fitness after outpatient procedures.\r"

This study evaluated the emotional and behavioural responses of children to being accompanied by a parent at induction of anaesthesia in a paediatric day-care surgical centre. One hundred and thirty-four patients (aged 2-10 yr, ASA physical status I or II) were divided into two groups by day of surgery, to have a parent present at induction of anaesthesia (treatment group), or to be unaccompanied (control group). Before, and at one week after surgery, the child's fears and behaviour were scored by the Hospital Fears Inventory (HFI) and Behavioural Questionnaire (BQ), and parental anxiety by the Parents' Questionnaire (PQ) before and at one week after surgery. The Global Mood Scale (GMS) was used to assess the child's behaviour and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to assess the parent's anxiety on arrival for surgery and at induction of anaesthesia. All patients and parents were disturbed by the experience, but to the same degree in the treatment and control groups. Subgroups of \"calm\" and \"anxious\" parents were identified by a median split of their preoperative VAS scores. Children in the \"calm-treatment,\" \"calm-control\" and \"anxious-control\" subgroups were similarly upset at induction. Children in the \"anxious-treatment\" subgroup were the most disturbed at induction, and significantly more than those in the \"anxious-control\" subgroup. Preoperative parental anxiety levels also correlated with the child's fears and behaviour one week after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean changes in cardiac output were approximately -19 and -2 per cent and in heart rate -1 and +26 per cent for pipecuronium and pancuronium respectively. Plasma and urine concentrations of pipecuronium were also measured and the pharmacokinetic variables obtained indicated rapid initial decrease in plasma concentration (t1/2 = 7.6 minutes) followed by a longer terminal phase (t1/2 = 161 minutes). The central compartment volume was 102 +/- 24 ml.kg-1 and plasma clearance was 1.8 +/- 0.4 ml.kg-1 min-1. Approximately 56 per cent of the dose was recovered from the urine within 24 hours of administration and about 25 per cent of this was the metabolite, 3-desacetyl pipecuronium. High-dose pipecuronium administration under the anaesthetic regimen employed did not produce deleterious haemodynamic effects. The pharmacokinetic variables after bolus injection of pipecuronium did not deviate from those reported under normothermic conditions.\r"

During thiopentone-nitrous oxide-enflurane anaesthesia 20 adults were given atracurium 0.5 mg.kg-1. Both ulnar nerves were stimulated with TOF every 12 sec until one per cent recovery of first twitch (T1). At this time, ST stimulation was applied to one arm, selected at random. When the mean value of T1 and ST reached ten per cent of control, edrophonium, 1 mg.kg-1, preceded by atropine was given either as a single dose, or in two doses consisting of 0.2 mg.kg-1 followed by 0.8 mg.kg-1 three minutes later. No statistically significant differences were observed between T1 and ST for the next ten minutes, whether edrophonium had been given in single or divided doses. Giving edrophonium in divided doses did not improve recovery significantly, measured with either T1, ST or train-of-four ratio (T4/T1). Five minutes after the first administration of edrophonium, T1 was (mean +/- SEM) 86 +/- 3 and 86 +/- 2 per cent control in the single and divided dose groups respectively.

The present study was designed to investigate possible dissimilarities in cardiovascular and sympathetic events after administration of either NX or NBPH in dogs made hypercapnic following fentanyl administration.

This caused a significant decrease in heart rate (HR) (P less than 0.001), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (P less than 0.001), and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) (P less than 0.002). Then, ventilation was decreased to produce a PaCO2 of 60 mmHg; this was accompanied by a significant elevation in plasma level of both epinephrine (EPI) (P less than 0.02) and NE (P less than 0.001). Administration of 20 micrograms.kg-1 NX to six dogs resulted in immediate increases in HR (P less than 0.01) and MAP (P less than 0.01), and a further rise in CA levels to greater than pre-fentanyl baseline values. In six other dogs, NBPH (0.3 mg.kg-1) caused increases in HR (P less than 0.001) and MAP (P less than 0.001) only, and the MAP rise was significantly less than that seen in the NX group (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether centrally mediated sympathetic tone exerts compensatory effects on nitrous oxide-induced myocardial depression during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia. The cardiovascular responses to 60 minutes of nitrous oxide administration after fentanyl, 100 micrograms.kg-1, were examined in 18 dogs with or without autonomic blockade induced by hexamethonium. Decreases of cardiac output and left ventricular stroke work were significantly greater in dogs with autonomic blockade (n = 9) by about 20 per cent of baseline values than in dogs without autonomic blockade (n = 9) at 30, 45, and 60 min. Similarly, left ventricular dP/dt was reduced more in dogs with autonomic blockade than in dogs without autonomic blockade, but this difference was only significant at the 60-min period. It is concluded that the sympathetic nervous system provides partial compensation for myocardial depression induced by nitrous oxide in the presence of high-dose fentanyl, suggesting that large doses of fentanyl do not ablate the centrally mediated sympathomimetic effects of nitrous oxide.\r"

The amiodarone group (Group 1, ten patients, cumulative dose 10 g) was compared with a control group (nine patients, Group 2). Amiodarone (A) and desethylamiodarone (NA) concentrations in plasma and myocardium were measured and haemodynamic and antiarrhythmic effects were analysed. Throughout anaesthesia haemodynamic status was similar in both groups. No correlation was found between A/NA and cardiac index changes. No patients needed intraaortic blood pressure augmentation or developed low systemic vascular resistances. Pacemaker dependency was similar in both groups and there was no evidence of increased anaesthetic risk. An excellent antiarrhythmic effect was obtained during the postoperative period. We conclude that preoperative treatment with amiodarone is effective against postoperative arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Several cases of recurrent respiratory depression progressing to apnoea and unconsciousness after apparent recovery from sufentanil have been reported recently. Alfentanil has the shortest elimination half-time of the narcotics used in anaesthesia, suggesting that it should be the least likely to cause postoperative respiratory depression. A case of recurrent unconsciousness and respiratory arrest after apparent recovery from alfentanil-isoflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia is reported. A total dose of 137 micrograms.kg-1 alfentanil was given over a 3.25-hr period to a 45-year-old female undergoing partial gastrectomy. Naloxone, 0.16 mg IV, rapidly restored spontaneous ventilation and consciousness. This case demonstrates that apnoea and unconsciousness can also recur after apparent recovery from alfentanil. Recovery room personnel should be aware of this phenomenon. Earlier detection may permit treatment before apnoea occurs. Patients given narcotic-supplemented anaesthesia should be monitored by capnography and/or pulse oximetry in the early postoperative period.\r"

Subsequent assessment of this equipment with an anaesthetic agent analyzer revealed that, at the ventilator settings which had been used, the delivered anaesthetic vapour concentration varied greatly from the vaporizer settings. This problem eventually was traced to a malfunctioning inlet control valve on the ventilator. This complication may have been prevented if the end-tidal anaesthetic concentration had been monitored intraoperatively.\r"

In both patients, renal biopsy specimens showed significant arteriosclerotic changes in addition to mesangial proliferation. Increased fibrinopeptide A concentration in their plasma suggested increased thrombin generation. In one patient, no systemic arteriosclerosis coexisted, judging from normal optic fundi and the absence of neurological and cardiac abnormalities. In IgA nephritis, renal vascular hyalinosis is often observed, probably resulting from vascular injury. Thus, it was suggested that the decreased fibrinolysis and renal vascular injury of these patients synergistically induced more fibrin thrombi and accelerated arteriosclerosis of the kidney. These cases imply the important role of fibrinolytic disorders in the progression of IgA nephritis.\r"

All of them followed the diet for 6 months, 23 patients for 1 year and 9 for 2 to 4 years. Mean levels of IgA containing circulating immune complexes (IgAIC), detected by a specific conglutinin assay and by measuring IgA content in 2.5% polyethylene glycol precipitates, on an unrestricted diet, significantly decreased after 6 months of gluten-free diet (p less than 0.01) and remained reduced during the follow-up. A decrease in IgAIC levels was evident in 85.7% of the cases with basal positive data, with complete normalization in 64.3% of them. IgA to gluten antigens (ethanol- or saline-soluble gliadin, glutenin and the lectin fraction termed glyc-gli) as well as to heterologous bovine and egg albumins were found to be significantly increased on an unrestricted diet in the group of 14 IgAGN patients with basal positive IgAIC. The mean levels of IgA to most dietary antigens significantly decreased after 6 months to 1 year of a gluten-free diet. A decrease in IgA to ethanol-soluble gliadin was evident in 81.8% of the cases with basal positive data, with complete normalization in 63.6%. A subgroup of 27.5% of IgAGN patients showed positive IgAIC values associated with increased IgA values to a variety of dietary antigens. A gluten-free diet induced in 75% of the cases a parallel improvement in these abnormal immunological data. Mean proteinuria values were found to be significantly decreased after 6 months of the diet and a reduction was also observed in microscopic hematuria. However, mean blood creatinine levels showed a significant increase after the gluten-free diet. The data of this study indicate that a gluten-free diet can modify some immunological abnormalities in a group of IgAGN patients, reducing levels of IgAIC and IgA to dietary antigens. The clinical course does not seem to be favorably influenced, since a relentless progression towards renal failure was observed.\r"

Eleven children developed ESRD immediately following HUS, in nine others temporary partial recovery of kidney function for 0.5-13.2 years was observed. Twenty-four grafts were transplanted in these 20 patients. Graft survival was no different from overall cadaver graft survival. In nine patients failure of the first kidney graft occurred, while the four second grafts were still functioning at the time of writing. Recurrence of HUS was suspected but not proven to be the cause of first graft failure in two patients, and impaired graft function in a third one. A short interval between HUS and kidney transplantation seems to adversely affect graft survival. No other factors influencing outcome of transplantation could be detected.\r"

Although serum creatinine increased and creatinine clearance decreased, inulin clearance did not show significant variations. Furthermore, serum creatinine fell to the baseline value within 60 days after discontinuation of vitamin D therapy. The increased serum creatinine may be explained by an augmented release from muscular tissue, probably due to the improvement of uremic myopathy induced by calcitriol.\r"

Content of P-450 human-2 assessed by Western blots was correlated to microsomal S-(+)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, R-(-)-hexobarbital 3' alpha-hydroxylation, and S-(+)-hexobarbital 3' beta-hydroxylation, and was less correlated to R-(-)mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, R-(-)-hexobarbital 3' beta-hydroxylation, and S-(+)-hexobarbital 3' alpha-hydroxylation. Antibodies raised against P-450 human-2 inhibited microsomal S-(+)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation efficiently but was less efficient on R-(-)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation in extensive metabolizers and on 4'-hydroxylation of mephenytoin enantiomers in poor metabolizers. The antibodies also inhibited R-(-)-hexobarbital 3' alpha-hydroxylation and S-(+)-hexobarbital 3' beta-hydroxylation but did not effectively inhibit the hydroxylation of the two other optical isomers of hexobarbital in extensive metabolizers and of four stereoisomers in poor metabolizers. These findings indicate the close relationship between polymorphic mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation and two stereospecific hexobarbital hydroxylations, and they suggest that P-450 human-2 is a typical S-(+)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase and a major hexobarbital 3'-hydroxylase in the livers of extensive metabolizers. The findings were further supported by the experiments that used P-450 human-2 complementary dexoyribonucleic acid-derived protein in yeast microsomes.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total proteins, as well as the plasma binding of racemic, d-methadone, and l-methadone were measured in 45 healthy subjects. The AAG phenotypes and the concentrations of AAG variants were also determined. The measured free fractions for racemic, d-methadone, and l-methadone were, respectively, 12.7% +/- 3.3%, 10.0% +/- 2.9%, and 14.2% +/- 3.2% (mean +/- SD). A significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio (B/F) for dl-methadone and the total AAG concentration (r = 0.724; p less than 0.001). A multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that AAG was the main explanatory variable for the binding of the racemate. When concentrations of AAG variants were considered, a significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio of dl-methadone and orosomucoid2 A concentration (r = 0.715; p less than 0.001), a weak correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid1 S concentration (r = 0.494; p less than 0.001), and no correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid1 F1 concentration (r = 0.049; not significant). Similar findings were obtained with the enantiomers. This study shows the importance of considering not only total AAG but also concentrations of AAG variants when measuring the binding of methadone and possibly of other drugs in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied the effect of albendazole on microsomal reserve and on first-pass activation to albendazole sulfoxide in patients with hydatid disease. An aminopyrine breath test was performed in 12 patients while they were receiving albendazole treatment and while they were not. Excretion of 14CO2 in breath averaged 0.70%.kg.mmol-1 +/- 0.20%.kg.mmol-1 without treatment and 0.54%.kg.mmol-1 +/- 0.14%.kg.mmol-1 with treatment (p less than 0.005). Plasma levels of albendazole sulfoxide were measured 4 hours after the morning dose during the first and second half of the 4-week treatment cycles. In nine of the 12 patients albendazole sulfoxide levels decreased during the second half of the cycle by an average of 0.84 +/- 0.76 mumol/L (p less than 0.02). Transaminase levels increased in 10 of the 12 patients during long-term albendazole treatment, and major side effects, including hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, and alopecia, were observed in three patients. We conclude that albendazole partially inhibits microsomal enzyme function but induces its own metabolism. Hepatotoxicity and other possible severe side effects necessitate close therapeutic monitoring of patients who are given albendazole.\r"

  ".W": "Orthostatic hypotension is a clinical condition that frequently involves abnormal adrenergic control of cardiovascular function. Adrenergic function was studied in six patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and in 11 age-matched healthy subjects. The patients demonstrated higher supine mean arterial pressures (MAP; 103 +/- 8 versus 86 +/- 4 mm Hg) and orthostatic hypotension (delta MAP -70 +/- 5 versus +15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) compared with normal subjects. The delta MAP in phase II of the Valsalva maneuver was significantly greater (-31 +/- 4 versus -7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.002) and phase IV heart rate response was blunted (-5 +/- 3 versus -30 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.02) in these patients. More isoproterenol was required to increase heart rate by 25 beats per minute in patients with hypotension (810 +/- 670 versus 3.1 +/- 1.3 micrograms, p less than 0.05), indicating marked chronotropic hyposensitivity. Leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor densities were similar in patients and controls. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor coupling, however, was elevated in patients with hypotension when compared with control subjects (ratio of the low-affinity and high-affinity dissociation constants [KL/KH] 140 +/- 7.4 versus 66 +/- 4.3, p less than 0.001). There were negative correlations between the KL/KH value and the dose of isoproterenol required to decrease MAP by 20 torr (p less than 0.02) and between the KL/KH value and the product of the hormone receptor and MAP (p less than 0.01). However, the patients could be subdivided into a group who could mount a nearly normal hormone receptor times MAP response on standing (group 1A), and a group who could not (group 1B). The group 1A patients had elevated plasma norepinephrine responses associated with milder beta 2-adrenergic receptor supercoupling, whereas group 1B patients had essentially no orthostatic plasma norepinephrine response and had much higher KL/KH values. Thus, though a state of biochemical supersensitivity existed in both patient subgroups, diminished catecholamine exposure was associated, as expected, with beta 2-adrenergic hypersensitivity in group 1B, whereas there was no diminution of catecholamine exposure in the beta 2-adrenergic hypersensitivity observed in group 1A patients.\r"

Compared to this low intraindividual variation, interindividual variation was slightly higher--the mean coefficient of interindividual variation was 14%, with a range from 10% to 17%. A one-way ANOVA with repeat measures showed that on any one of four separate occasions of ethanol administration, the eight subjects differed from one another (p less than 0.01), but that each subject remained similar from one test to another. The consumption of food before ethanol administration increased variability. Fever associated with upper respiratory infection also increased variability, but exercise did not.\r"

Perindopril is the ester pro-drug of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat. The influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of perindopril (4 mg administered orally) and the time course of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum was studied in a randomized crossover short-term study of 12 healthy subjects. Food significantly decreased the relative availability of perindoprilat by 35% +/- 42%, the fractional urinary excretion of perindoprilat from 19% +/- 7% to 13% +/- 4% (p less than 0.05), and the partial metabolic clearance of perindopril to perindoprilat from 102 +/- 57 ml.min-1 to 72 +/- 32 ml.min-1 (p less than 0.05). These changes were associated with a significant decrease in the area under the percent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition-versus-time curve by 15% (p less than 0.05). Food did not alter the total amount of drug recovered in urine as perindopril and its metabolites, and it did not alter perindoprilat renal clearance. We concluded that food alters the conversion of perindopril to its active metabolite perindoprilat after single-dose administration of perindopril.\r"

The known in vivo and in vitro inhibitory properties of sulfaphenazole were used to convert control phase subjects to phenotypically \"poor\" metabolizers of tolbutamide. Six healthy subjects were given a single 500 mg oral dose of tolbutamide with and without sulfaphenazole, 500 mg every 12 hours. Tolbutamide, hydroxytolbutamide, and carboxytolbutamide in urine were determined by newly developed HPLC procedures. Plasma tolbutamide clearance and half-life were measured, as were the metabolic ratio (hydroxytolbutamide + carboxytolbutamide/tolbutamide) in successive 6-hour urine collections. The mean tolbutamide plasma clearance decreased from 0.196 +/- 0.026 ml/min/kg without sulfaphenazole to 0.039 +/- 0.009 ml/min kg with sulfaphenazole, and the mean half-life of tolbutamide increased from 7.28 +/- 0.89 hours to 38.76 +/- 13.30 hours. The metabolic ratio determined in the 6 to 12 hour urine collection period decreased from 794.0 +/- 86.6 to 126.0 +/- 79.3, and this collection period also gave the best separation of subjects between phases. There was a good correlation between tolbutamide plasma clearance and metabolic ratio (rs = 0.853, p less than 0.01, n = 12) and between the percentage decrease in plasma tolbutamide clearance and the percentage decrease in metabolic ratio (r = 0.932, p less than 0.01, n = 6). The tolbutamide urinary metabolic ratio therefore effectively distinguishes tolbutamide hydroxylase activity in \"normal\" subjects and in those converted to model phenotypically \"poor\" metabolizers by sulfaphenazole.\r"

Sixteen (nine female, seven male) healthy adult (21-35 years old) subjects were used. Cold stimulus was applied with gel-filled compresses. Forehead temperature under the compress as an indication of stimulus magnitude, heart rate, blood flow in the finger, toe and calf by venous occlusion plethysmography, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were monitored. Three protocols were carried out in which the temperature (0, 5, 10, 15 degrees C), placement (whole face, unilateral, forehead) and duration (20, 40, 60, 120 s) of the cold compress application were varied. 3. The data indicate that 0 degrees C compresses applied bilaterally for 40 s produced the maximum bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. No subject found this test to be obnoxious, but a 120 s application was objectionable to some subjects. This cold face test resulted in 22%, 72%, 59% and 44% reductions in heart rate and blood flow to the finger, toe and calf, respectively. There was significant between-subject variability, but good consistency in responses to tests repeated in the same subject on different days, at different times of day and in different seasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the percentage binding of ouabain-sensitive [3H]ouabain was plotted against the log of the concentration of drug in mol/l, it was shown that the bufalin curve was shifted to the left of that of ouabain and that of cinobufotalin was to the right. 4. Linear regression lines were fitted to the data transformed as the log of (p/1--p) plotted against the log of the drug concentration, where p is the proportion of maximal ouabain-sensitive activity at the drug concentration being considered. The IC50 (the concentration of drug producing a 50% change in the maximal ouabain-sensitive response) was 1.4 x 10(-9) mol/l for bufalin, 9.7 x 10(-9) mol/l for ouabain and 1.70 x 10(-7) mol/l for cinobufotalin. 5. The introduction of bufalin 1 h before ouabain reduced the binding of [3H]ouabain to 23.4 +/- 1.5% (P less than 0.001). Bufalin added in the second hour reduced the ouabain-sensitive binding from 100 +/- 1.9% to 87.4 +/- 2.9% (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Free fatty acids when incubated in vitro (micellar suspension with 1 mmol/l Tween 40) with rabbit gall-bladders can promote abundant mucus secretion. 3. The hexosamine content of rabbit gall-bladder walls, measured by gas-liquid chromatography, was significantly higher in gall-bladders incubated with fatty acids than in control tissues. 4. The biochemical data were supported by ultrastructural findings showing numerous droplets with a translucent content in the perinuclear cytoplasm. Exocytosis was also seen in treated gall-bladders, confirming the secretory nature of the vesicles. 5. These results suggest that free fatty acids, which appear in high amounts when bile lecithins are hydrolysed by phospholipase, play an active role in the gall-stone formation.\r"

The basal urinary PGF2 alpha excretion rate of 3.9 pmol/h (n = 23) did not vary with urine pH. In marked contrast, PGE2 excretion increased as the urine became more alkaline. The PGE2/PGF2 alpha ratio therefore progressively increased from 1.5 to 22 as the pH of the urine changed from pH 5.8 to pH 7.8. 3. The independence of PGF2 alpha excretion from urine pH: (a) excludes cyclo-oxygenase as a potential site of action for the pH-dependence of urinary PGE2 excretion; (b) suggests that the urinary PGE2/PGF2 alpha ratio measured in alkaline urine may be a more accurate reflection of the kidneys, ability to synthesize these two prostaglandins in vivo; (c) suggests that control of urine pH is required before the urinary PGE2/PGF2 alpha ratio can be employed as an index of PGE2 9-ketoreductase (EC 1.1.1.189) activity in vivo.\r"

To examine the metabolic effects of increases in circulating endogenous plasma catecholamines, we measured plasma glucose, potassium and magnesium in 14 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. The patients were randomized into two groups and received either sodium nitroprusside (a direct-acting vasodilator) or trimetaphan camsylate (a ganglion-blocking agent) for routine control of blood pressure during the operation. 2. There were significant differences between the two groups in the levels of all three metabolic variables studied. Plasma glucose levels rose in both groups, but were significantly higher in the sodium nitroprusside group [peak levels 9.14 (SEM 0.72)mmol/l compared with 6.71 (0.88) mmol/l, P less than 0.001, analysis of variance]. The cardioplegia solution caused a large increase in plasma magnesium in both groups but in the sodium nitroprusside group the level rose higher [to 1.59 (0.12)mmol/l compared with 1.34 (0.06)mmol/l] and fell faster (P less than 0.05, analysis of variance). In the group receiving sodium nitroprusside, plasma potassium fell, by a mean of 0.34mmol/l, as plasma catecholamine levels rose; no such fall was seen in the group receiving trimetaphan camsylate (P less than 0.05, analysis of variance). 3. It is concluded that the sympathoadrenal system is important in causing metabolic changes during cardiopulmonary bypass and may be relevant in other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction.\r"

In order to study the acute effects of blood volume changes on the vascular resistance of portal-systemic collaterals (collateral vascular resistance), a model of total portal vein occlusion with 100% portal-systemic shunts was developed in the rat. In this model, we determined the haemodynamic effects of haemorrhage (1.8 ml/100 g body weight) or intravenous infusion of a volume expander (1.8 ml/100 g body weight). Cardiac output and regional blood flows were measured by the radioactive microsphere method. 2. Haemorrhage significantly reduced arterial pressure from 108 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 4 mmHg (mean +/- SEM), cardiac output from 56 +/- 4 to 24 +/- 2 ml min-1 100 g-1 body weight, portal pressure from 15.1 +/- 1.5 to 10.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg and portal tributary blood flow from 19.9 +/- 2.3 to 8.3 +/- 1.4 ml/min. Consequently, collateral vascular resistance significantly increased from 6.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(3) to 11.1 +/- 2.0 x 10(3) kPa 1(-1) s. 3. Volume expansion reduced arterial pressure from 98 +/- 3 to 90 +/- 3 mmHg, and significantly increased cardiac output from 43 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 3 ml min-1 100 g-1 body weight, portal pressure from 13.9 +/- 0.7 to 16.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg and portal tributary blood flow from 16.4 +/- 1.3 to 28.2 +/- 3.2 ml/min. Consequently, collateral vascular resistance significantly decreased from 7.0 +/- 0.5 x 10(3) to 4.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(3) kPa l-1 s. 4. This study shows that in rats with portal hypertension, portal-systemic collateral vascular resistance is modified by alterations in blood volume.\r"

To study potassium transport in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in a model of striated muscle cells, we measured specific [3H]ouabain binding (the number of sodium-potassium pumps), sodium-potassium-pump-mediated (ouabain-sensitive) 86Rb+ influx and sodium-potassium-pump-independent (ouabain-resistant) 86Rb+ influx in lymphocytes in vitro. 2. The subjects comprised euthyroid and thyrotoxic men with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis between attacks, men with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis, and healthy men matched for age and weight. 3. Thyrotoxic patients, both with and without periodic paralysis, had significantly more lymphocyte sodium-potassium pumps than normal, and a significantly greater sodium-potassium-pump-mediated 86Rb+ influx. Anti-thyroid treatment corrected this defect in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Euthyroid patients with cryptogenic periodic paralysis had significantly increased sodium-potassium-pump-mediated 86Rb+ influx, but a normal number of sodium-potassium pumps. 4. Only untreated thyrotoxic and euthyroid patients with periodic paralysis showed a significant increase in sodium-potassium-pump-independent 86Rb+ influx (5.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.5 +/- 1.8 respectively, vs control 2.8 +/- 1.0 pmol h-1 10(-6) cells; mean +/- SD; P less than 0.001, P less than 0.005). 5. We conclude that thyrotoxicosis increases the number and activity of sodium-potassium pumps and facilitates, but is probably not necessary for, periodic paralysis. Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is associated with an increase in sodium-potassium-pump-independent potassium influx.\r"

However, the evidence documenting improvements in myocardial acidosis and in myocardial resuscitability after administration of calcium-entry blockers during cardiac arrest is incomplete. We therefore compared the effects of verapamil (0.05 mg/kg) and diltiazem (0.075 mg/kg) with those of saline placebo in an established porcine model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 2. After verapamil, six of 11 animals were successfully resuscitated; after diltiazem, five of 10; and after saline placebo, six of 10. Coronary perfusion and mean aortic pressures together with end-tidal CO2 concentration during precordial compression were predictive of resuscitation, independently of the drug or placebo. 3. Coronary vein pH decreased to 6.91 +/- 0.06 units (mean +/- SEM) with concurrent increases in PCO2 to levels exceeding 100 mmHg. Coronary vein lactate increased to a maximum of 7.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l. Coronary vein acidaemia was accompanied by decreases in intramyocardial pH to 6.64 +/- 0.06 units. However, each of these differences between success and failure of resuscitation was unrelated to treatment with calcium-entry blockers. 4. Accordingly, neither verapamil nor diltiazem selectively altered coronary perfusion pressure, attenuated intramyocardial acidosis or improved resuscitability after porcine cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\r"

Sodium content was significantly reduced after a 20 min incubation with ethanol at concentrations between 17 and 170 mmol/l. 3. The rise in sodium content during a 20 min incubation with ouabain was significantly less in the presence of 170 mmol/l ethanol as compared with 17 mmol/l ethanol. 4.

Total calcium intake is not related to the risk of colon cancer, and separation of calcium into dairy and nondairy sources does not alter the result. There is, however, a significant, monotonic increase in sigmoid colon cancer risk with decreasing total calcium intake. Similar trends are shown for both dairy and nondairy calcium. Dietary calcium is not consumed in large quantities among the Hawaii Japanese, partly because of their limited consumption of milk due to lactose intolerance. If calcium plays a protective role against sigmoid colon cancer, this effect is unlikely to be related to fat intake. Sigmoid colon cancer subjects had lower intakes of fat than other cohort men, and a statistical test for the interaction effect of total calcium and fat intake on colon cancer risk was statistically insignificant (P = 0.2).\r"

During this time, 486 patients underwent colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis was performed in 60 of those patients (12 percent). A retrospective histologic examination of the slides of the operative specimens in the latter group revealed that nine patients had Crohn's disease. Of the 51 remaining patients with ulcerative colitis, the colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis was performed as an elective procedure in 44 cases (86 percent) and as a one-stage procedure in 48 patients (94 percent). Complications occurred in 7 of 43 patients (16 percent) undergoing an elective, one-stage procedure. There were two postoperative deaths (4 percent). There were 22 patients (43 percent) who had their ileorectal anastomosis in function at the time of follow-up, with a mean time of observation of 13 years. The cumulative probability of having the ileorectal anastomosis in function at 10 years was 51 percent. The causes of total excision were recurrent inflammation in the retained rectum (N = 23), dysplasia (N = 3), and postoperative complications (N = 3). No rectal carcinoma occurred. Patients with preoperative mild rectal disease had a better outcome (ileorectal anastomosis in function at time of follow-up) compared with patients with moderate rectal disease (P less than 0.001). The functional outcome of ileorectal anastomosis was, if anything, better than what is stated in the literature following pelvic pouch procedure.\r"

Using the radial perfusion catheter, the squeeze pressure profile was consistent with a double-loop external sphincter mechanism. Using the linear perfusion catheter, the internal sphincter relaxation pressures show a greater negative deflection at the proximal portions of the sphincter, which was not achieved at points distally in the same quadrant. This implies that during reflex relaxation, pressure is maintained in the distal anal canal so that patients remain continent during sensory sampling of rectal contents. The authors believe this is the first time this same-quadrant longitudinal asymmetry of relaxation has been shown with a single rectal balloon stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred eight patients with retention disorders have been studied. Most frequent causes were idiopathic (107), iatrogenic (57), and obstetric (33). Twenty-five patients experienced soiling, 31 had insufficient function, and 152 complained of incontinence. Seventy percent of patients with idiopathic incontinence did not experience urge, compared with 38 percent with iatrogenic and only 3 percent with obstetric incontinence. The incidence of prolapse was 58 percent in patients with idiopathic incontinence, 20 percent in patients with iatrogenic incontinence, and only 3 percent in patients with obstetric incontinence. The authors conclude that the function of the puborectalis sling is to create the anorectal angle to evoke the feeling of urge and to support intra-abdominal contents and, furthermore, that fecal incontinence after anorectal surgery was likely caused by denervation. Anal resting and squeeze pressures varied widely. There was a huge overlap in the different groups. Mean resting and squeeze pressures were 9.5 kPa and 9.4 kPa, respectively, in controls, 4.8 kPa and 10.3 kPa, respectively, in the soiling group, 7.1 and 6.1 kPa, respectively, in the insufficient group, and 5.1 and 2.7 kPa, respectively, in the incontinent group. An incontinent external sphincter function could be defined as a function of the external sphincter causing a pressure increase of 5 kPa or less during straining. The ability to retain feces, therefore, is based on external sphincter function. Anal manometry is, indeed, a suitable technique to determine anal sphincter functions, but the presence of a retention disorder cannot definitely be determined. Its clinical application remains under discussion.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups based on the extent of their disease: (1) patients with unresectable primary tumors; (2) patients with recurrent disease after abdominoperineal resection; and (3) patients with isolated inguinal lymph node metastases after abdominoperineal resection. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 underwent biopsy of their nodal metastases. Patients in Group 3 were treated by inguinal node dissection. Survival data were examined for each group, and four clinical and pathologic features were analyzed to determine their impact on prognosis: depth of invasion of the primary tumor (T1-2 vs. T3-4), number of positive lymph nodes in the rectal specimen (0-2 vs. greater than 2), extent of the inguinal lymph node metastases (unilateral vs. bilateral), and timing of the inguinal lymph node metastases (less than 1 vs. greater than 1 year after abdominoperineal resection). There were no five-year survivors in any group. Median survival was highest in those with isolated lymph node metastases, with 2 patients remaining free of disease, and was lowest in those with unresectable primary disease (7 months). Median survival was increased when inguinal LNM were unilateral (17 vs. 6 months; P less than 0.01) and when they occurred more than 1 year after abdominoperineal resection (21 vs. 7 months; P = 0.02). Stage of the primary lesion (depth of invasion and number of positive lymph nodes) did not affect survival. Of the 32 patients who underwent biopsy alone, only 1 developed a tumor-related groin complication. For patients with isolated inguinal lymph node metastases, inguinal node dissection is recommended for the purposes of local control and possible cure. For patients with extranodal disease, prophylactic excision of inguinal lymph node metastases is not warranted.\r"

The collagen turnover in the anastomotic area, as well as the changes of breaking strength, were equal between the groups in the early healing course, implying that the stenosis group, as an entity, did not show impairment in the studied parameters predisposing for complications. Other factors such as mechanical strain by the increased fecal bulk and increased bacterial load may contribute to occurrence of the anastomotic complications.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess the safety of the BAR after irradiation with the equivalent of 6000 rad. Thirteen mongrel dogs underwent preoperative irradiation to the rectum and rectosigmoid, receiving 6000 rad according to the nominal standard dose equation. After a three-week rest period, each dog underwent anterior resection of the rectosigmoid and anastomosis with the BAR. The anastomoses were evaluated for early and late healing and anastomotic leaks. The results were compared with previous data from the authors' laboratory using an identical model. Radiographic leaks were found in 7 of 10 sutured anastomoses, 8 of 10 stapled anastomoses, and 3 of 13 BAR anastomoses (P less than 0.01). Comparative clinical leaks were 5 of 10 for sutured, 5 of 10 for stapled, and 3 of 13 for BAR anastomoses. These data suggest that the BAR may offer added safety to an anastomosis after preoperative irradiation. Whether this effect is due to the atraumatic technique of placing the device, improved blood flow to the anastomotic margins, or other factors, is still underdetermined.\r"

  ".U": "90183653\r", 
  ".W": "In 1984 a national registry of families with familial adenomatous polyposis was set up in The Netherlands to promote screening in those families. Eight-two families had been registered by the end of 1988. Analysis of the pedigrees showed that 204 family members at risk had not yet been screened. The diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis was histologically confirmed in 230 patients. These patients were subdivided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with familial adenomatous polyposis referred because they were symptomatic, and Group B relatives of these patients who were found by screening to have familial adenomatous polyposis. The authors compared these groups with respect to the occurrence of colorectal carcinoma. Fifty-four patients were found to have a colorectal carcinoma at the time of diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, i.e., 49 of the 104 patients in Group A (47 percent) and five of the 126 patients in Group B (4 percent). The average age at diagnosis of the 104 patients in Group A was 35 years (range, 13 to 66 years) and that of the 126 patients in Group B was 24 years (range, 8 to 59 years). By the age of 40 years, 90 percent of the patients in group B had been diagnosed. Late onset of familial adenomatous polyposis was found in four families. Endoscopy and/or radiography of the upper digestive tract were (was) performed in 44 of the 230 patients. Nineteen patients (43 percent) were found to have polyps in the stomach or duodenum, or both. In our series, only one patient died from cancer of the upper digestive tract (ampullary carcinoma). These results show conclusively that screening leads to the early detection of familial adenomatous polyposis. The value of a national registry is proved by the finding of many at-risk family members who had not previously been screened. Screening should start between the ages of 10 and 12 and should continue up to the age of 50. In the rare cases of families with an apparently late onset of familial adenomatous polyposis, screening should be continued up to age 60. More studies are needed to determine the natural history of polyps in the upper digestive tract.\r"

The hepatic arterial capacity to buffer portal flow changes was studied over a wide range of portal flow with arterial pressure held steady (the active buffer response) or uncontrolled. The active component of the buffer response led to nearly full dilation of the hepatic artery at low portal flows as shown by inability to dilate further in response to adenosine infusion; at high portal flows the hepatic artery was nearly fully constricted as shown by lack of further constriction to norepinephrine. With pressure uncontrolled, active and passive effects combined to produce an increased compensation with similar efficiency (44% +/- 4%) over the full range of portal blood flows. Thus, although the active component of the hepatic arterial buffer response becomes less efficient at very high and low portal flows, the combination of active and passive effects leads to a larger buffer capacity which is equally efficient over a wide range of portal blood flow changes.\r"

To evaluate the significance of this malabsorption, concurrent fecal excretion of both exogenous radiolabeled bile acid and endogenous (unlabeled) bile acid were measured in patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea. Subjects received a 2.5-microCi oral dose of taurocholic acid labeled with 14C in the 24th position of the steroid moiety. Endogenous bile acid excretion was measured by a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase assay on a concurrent 72-h stool collection. Both radiolabeled and endogenous bile acid excretion were abnormally high in most patients with chronic diarrhea compared with normal subjects, even when equivoluminous diarrhea was induced in normal subjects by ingestion of osmotically active solutions. The correlation between radiolabeled and endogenous bile acid excretion was good. However, neither radiolabeled nor endogenous bile acid excretion was as abnormal as is typically seen in patients with ileal resection, and none of these diarrhea patients responded to treatment with cholestyramine with stool weights less than 200 g. These results suggest (a) that this radiolabeled bile acid excretion test accurately reflects excess endogenous bile acid excretion; (b) that excess endogenous bile acid excretion is not caused by diarrhea per se; (c) that spontaneously occurring idiopathic chronic diarrhea is often associated with increased endogenous bile acid excretion; and (d) that bile acid malabsorption is not likely to be the primary cause of diarrhea in most of these patients.\r"

X antigen was present in more than half of the individuals tested. There was a significant association between X antigen and markers of viral replication. Most individuals destined to become surface-antigen carriers had X antigen appearing before surface antigen, as did a smaller proportion of individuals transiently positive for surface antigen. A high frequency of X antigen was observed only in sera from human populations with a high frequency of other hepatitis B virus markers. These results suggest that X is a newly identified serum marker of viral replication that often appears before surface antigen in productive infections.\r"

The aims of the present study were to examine histologically the protective effect of capsaicin and to test whether this effect is related to changes in mucosal eicosanoid formation and mucosal blood flow. Intragastric capsaicin (160 microM) significantly reduced gross mucosal lesion formation induced by 25% ethanol. Light microscopy revealed that the depth of erosions was attenuated likewise. However, capsaicin did not prevent ethanol from causing superficial damage to the mucosa as observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. The protective action of capsaicin against ethanol remained unchanged by a dose of indomethacin that reduced the ex vivo formation of prostaglandin E2 and 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha in the gastric mucosa by about 90%. Capsaicin alone did not affect the ex vivo formation of these prostaglandins and of leukotriene C4. Intragastric capsaicin (160 microM) enhanced gastric mucosal blood flow by 89% as measured by the hydrogen gas clearance technique. This effect was also observed when capsaicin was administered together with 25% ethanol. These data indicate that afferent nerve stimulation by intragastric capsaicin protects against deep mucosal damage in response to ethanol, an effect that seems related to an increase in mucosal blood flow but not to eicosanoid formation.\r"

In this in vivo study we have measured the jejunal secretion rate of histamine in patients with Crohn's disease (n = 15) of the terminal small bowel and in healthy controls (n = 24). The secretion studies were performed using a recently developed segmental jejunal perfusion system with a two-balloon, six-channel small tube. The histamine secretion rate was 152 +/- 29 (SEM) ng/cm small intestine per h in patients with Crohn's disease, which meant a significant increase (p less than 0.01) compared with the secretion rate in controls (71 +/- 11 ng/cm per h). Moreover, the secretion of histamine was related to the disease activity. Patients with active disease (n = 8) (i.e., Crohn's disease activity index greater than 150) had a mean histamine secretion rate of 193 +/- 47 ng/cm per h, while patients with inactive disease (Crohn's disease activity index less than 150) had a secretion rate not significantly increased compared with controls (105 +/- 24 ng/cm per h). The present data indicate increased mast-cell involvement of the small intestine in active Crohn's disease of the distal ileum. This finding might reflect the systemic nature of the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chemically induced diabetes mellitus on the intestinal transport of glutamine was examined using a brush-border membrane vesicle technique. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg body weight). Control and diabetic rats were studied 5 days following the induction of diabetes. Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent glutamine (0.5 mM) transport was found to be significantly higher in the diabetic rats than in the control rats. This increase was found to be caused by a significant increase in the Vmax of the Na(+)-dependent and the Na(+)-independent glutamine transport processes in the diabetic rats (Vmax of 3742 +/- 487 and 2055 +/- 279 pmol/mg protein per 7 s, respectively) compared with that of the control rats (2183 +/- 75 and 1271 +/- 83 pmol/mg protein per 7 s, respectively). The apparent Km values of glutamine transport systems, on the other hand, were similar in the two rat groups. Insulin treatment of the diabetic rats significantly reduced the Vmax of glutamine transport by both the Na(+)-dependent and the Na(+)-independent processes to a level similar to that of the control rats (Vmax in the insulin-treated diabetic rats of 2036 +/- 123 and 1247 +/- 105 pmol/mg protein per 7 s, respectively). This study demonstrates that chemically induced diabetes mellitus is associated with an increase in intestinal glutamine transport. This increase is the result of the diabetic condition itself and appears to be mediated through an increase in the number of the transport carriers of glutamine.\r"

In addition, duodenal bicarbonate output is stimulated by luminal acidification and prostaglandins of the E class. The hypothesis that in vivo human duodenal bicarbonate transport persists in the absence of a plasma-to-lumen bicarbonate gradient and therefore is probably an active transport process was tested. In healthy subjects, a 4-cm segment of the proximal duodenum was isolated from gastric and pancreaticobillary secretions. Net duodenal bicarbonate secretion remained similar to basal levels during luminal perfusion with either 24 or 32 mM bicarbonate (each isoosmolar with plasma by the addition of NaCl). In addition, peak increases in acid-induced bicarbonate outputs with luminal perfusion of 154 mM NaCl and 32 mM NaHCO3 (+122 mM NaCl) were similar. Moreover, prostaglandin E2-stimulated bicarbonate secretion with perfusion of 154 mM NaCl and 32 mM NaHCO3 (+122 mM NaCl) was similar. It was concluded that in humans, proximal duodenal mucosal bicarbonate transport remains unaltered in the absence of a plasma-to-lumen bicarbonate gradient at rest and after stimulation with HCl or prostaglandin E2. These observations suggest that human proximal duodenal bicarbonate secretion involves active transport.\r"

  ".U": "90185008\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that Entamoeba histolytica lysates contain the neurohormones serotonin, neurotensin, immunoreactive substance P, and probably acetylcholine, and that amebic lysates inhibit sodium and chloride absorption and stimulate chloride secretion in the rat descending colon as measured by the Ussing chamber-voltage clamp technique. We now demonstrate that these transport effects have both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent components. In addition, arachidonic acid metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway are probably involved in the Entamoeba histolytica-induced changes in colonic transport that are not dependent on Ca++ entry. Prostaglandin E2 (10(-5) M), indomethacin (10(-6) M), piroxicam (5 x 10(-5) M), and mepacrine (10(-4) M) partially inhibited the amebic lysate effect on active transport in the rat descending colon. In addition, verapamil (10(-4) M) partially inhibited the effect of amebic lysates. The effect of verapamil was additive with that of indomethacin, totally blocking the effect of amebic lysate on short-circuit current. However, amebic lysates do not contain prostaglandin E2 as measured by sensitive radioimmunoassay. Amebic lysates stimulated prostaglandin E2 release from rat colonic mucosal strips. Amebic lysate significantly increased colonic cyclic adenosine monophosphate content. Piroxicam inhibited the lysate-induced increase in colonic cyclic adenosine monophosphate content. These results indicate that although amebic lysate does not contain prostaglandin E2, it caused arachidonic acid metabolites to be produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway, and these are probably involved in the Entamoeba histolytica-induced changes in colonic transport. Neurohormones in Entamoeba histolytica may act directly on colonic tissue to stimulate intestinal secretion, probably via a Ca+(+)-dependent mechanism that is blockable by verapamil, or indirectly via stimulation of prostaglandin E2 generation and release from the rat colon via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent mechanism. These effects appear separate. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent secretion is the predominant mechanism in this model of colonic amebic diarrhea.\r"

Removal of Na+ from the perfusates or addition of amiloride (1 mM) to serosal perfusate (containing HCO3-) had no influence on intracellular pH during exposure to pH 2 (N = 6), but removal of HCO3-/CO2 from or addition of 4, acetamido-4-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (0.5 mM) to the serosal perfusate (containing Na+) acidified intracellular pH from 7.02 +/- 0.03 to 6.45 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.01, N = 10) and from 6.97 +/- 0.06 to 6.58 +/- 0.26 (p less than 0.01, N = 6), respectively, in 15 min. In tissues exposed to mucosal pH 6, epithelial surface pH was about 1.3 pH units higher than pH of the mucosal bulk solution. Removal of Cl-/HCO3- from the serosal perfusate acidified epithelial surface pH by about 0.5 pH units (p less than 0.01, N = 6), suggesting that serosal HCO3- sustains intracellular pH, at least in part, by generating an alkaline buffer layer at the epithelial surface. In the absence of HCO3-/CO2, a stable intracellular pH was obtained when the tissue was exposed to mucosal pH 2.7, but in this situation intracellular pH was sensitive to Na+ removal or amiloride addition, intracellular pH decreasing from 7.00 +/- 0.07 to 6.48 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.01, N = 6) and from 6.86 +/- 0.06 to 6.32 +/- 0.01 (p less than 0.01, N = 7), respectively, in 15 min. The data suggest that in gastric epithelium exposed to luminal acid, physiological intracellular pH is primarily maintained by the buffer action of serosal HCO3- transported to the epithelial surface to impede the entry of luminal H+ into mucosal tissue. Removal of the sheltering HCO3- unmasks a second line, Na(+)-dependent and amiloride-sensitive intracellular pH regulatory mechanism, presumably a Na+/H+ antiport.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury closely resembles an inflammatory response. Thus, in vivo and in vitro experimental models were used to assess whether ethanol is proinflammatory in concentrations likely to be encountered by the gastric mucosa during acute intoxication. Perfusing the rat gastric lumen with progressively increasing concentrations of ethanol (10%, 20%, and 30%) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance from blood-to-gastric lumen. Rendering the animals neutropenic (with antineutrophil serum) ameliorated the ethanol-induced mucosal injury; the degree of protection was directly related to the severity of neutropenia. Neither superoxide dismutase, catalase, nor sodium benzoate offered any protection against ethanol-induced injury, indicating that neither superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, nor the hydroxyl radical is involved. To assess further whether ethanol could exert proinflammatory effects an in vitro model consisting of cultured bovine microvascular endothelial cells and isolated human neutrophils was used. Ethanol at concentrations of 1.0%-4.0% (but not at 0.1%-0.5%) increased neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells and enhanced neutrophil-mediated endothelial cell injury. We conclude that ethanol is proinflammatory at concentrations that may be achieved in the gastric mucosa during acute intoxication. The ethanol-induced, neutrophil-mediated cell injury does not appear to involve oxy radicals.\r"

Studies were made in healthy volunteers and in patients with peptic ulcer disease. Mucosal biopsies were taken from antral and oxyntic gland areas whereupon histamine content, histidine decarboxylase activity, and histamine methyltransferase activity were simultaneously assayed. Histamine content of the oxyntic gland mucosa was decreased as a consequence of pentagastrin administration in all groups studied, and this decrease was numerically largest in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. Pentagastrin induced a significant increase in histidine decarboxylase activity of the oxyntic gland mucosa with the most profound increase seen in patients with duodenal ulcer. The highest rates of histamine formation were present in the oxyntic mucosa of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The activity of histamine methyltransferase was the same in all groups studied and was not changed by pentagastrin. In conclusion, pentagastrin administration in humans is followed by a significant mobilization of histamine only from the oxyntic gland mucosa, an effect that is more pronounced in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

We tested several peptides chemotactic for different inflammatory cells, as well as a nonchemotactic peptide, bradykinin, for their ability to induce colitis in vivo in rabbits. These peptides were also assessed for their ability to stimulate release of the eicosanoids leukotrienes B4 and C4 and prostaglandin E2 from normal rabbit colons perfused ex vivo. Intracolonic administration of n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (chemotactic for neutrophils); its methyl ester (chemotactic for monocytes), and alanyl-glycyl-seryl-glutamic acid (chemotactic for eosinophils) all produced colitis (assessed grossly and histologically) within 4 days. Bradykinin did not induce colitis although it did release prostaglandin E2. n-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine methyl ester induced the greatest degree of colitis in vivo and released prostaglandin E2 and leukotrienes ex vivo. n-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and alanyl-glycyl-seryl-glutamic acid induced comparable degrees of inflammation, but alanyl-glycyl-seryl-glutamic acid produced no eicosanoid release while n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine released both prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 and leukotriene C4 products from normal ex vivo perfused colons. Thus alanyl-glycyl-seryl-glutamic acid produces colitis independent of proinflammatory eicosanoids while eicosanoid release could contribute to colitis produced by n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine methyl ester. This experimental model of colitis may reflect one possible etiology of inflammatory bowel disease in humans, when bacterial chemotactic peptides breach mucosal defenses in susceptible individuals.\r"

The present study investigated whether increased production of epidermal growth factor/alpha-tumor growth factor or increased density of epidermal growth factor receptors may occur in gastric carcinomas as compared with normal mucosa from the same individuals. Epidermal growth factor receptors were measurable by (125I)EGF-binding assays in 13 of 15 normal mucosas and in 15 of 15 carcinomas. The epidermal growth factor-binding capacity was significantly higher in carcinomas than in mucosa. A comparison of pairs of mucosa and carcinomas showed an increase of epidermal growth factor receptors in 9 of 15 carcinomas, no change in 3, and a decrease in 2 carcinomas. One mucinous adenocarcinoma contained extreme numbers of epidermal growth factor receptors (2445 fmol/mg protein) corresponding to a 320-fold increase over normal mucosa. Epidermal growth factor-like activity was increased in 2 of 22 carcinomas compared with mucosa. We conclude that relative overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors occurs in a fraction of gastric carcinomas. Whether increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptors is associated with particular patterns of tumor progression needs to be investigated.\r"

Guinea pigs (31 1-mo-old, 31 1-yr-old, and 23 3-yr-old) were placed on a cholelithogenic diet for 2 wk while another 10 guinea pigs of each age group remained on regular chow. Half of each group received a daily injection of cholecystokinin (0.5 nmol/kg). After 2 wk, guinea pigs were killed and the gallbladders were examined for gallstones. The concentrations of bile constituents were determined. The prevalence of gallstones was: 1-mo-old, control 0 out of 16, cholecystokinin 1 out of 15; 1-yr-old, control 3 out of 14, cholecystokinin 5 out of 16; 3-yr-old, control 10 out of 11, cholecystokinin 3 out of 8. Gallstone formation was significantly greater in 3-yr-old controls than in the two younger control groups, and cholecystokinin treatment significantly reduced the incidence of gallstones to near the level seen in younger guinea pigs. In the two younger age groups (but not in the 3-yr-old group), the cholelithogenic diet significantly reduced the concentration of bile salts in bile below that of guinea pigs on a normal diet. The cholelithogenic diet and treatment with cholecystokinin did not alter the relative compositions of bile lipids from that of guinea pigs on a normal diet in any of the three ages studied. In the second experiment we measured gallbladder emptying in response to exogenous infusion of cholecystokinin-8 (100 fmol/kg/h-100 nmol/kg/h) in the same three age groups of guinea pigs in vivo that had been maintained on regular chow. There was no difference in cholecystokinin sensitivity between the two younger age groups, but both were significantly more sensitive to cholecystokinin than the 3-yr-old guinea pigs in rate of gallbladder emptying in the dose range 1 pmol/kg/h-1 nmol/kg/h. We conclude that a major factor in the increased incidence of gallstone formation in the aged guinea pig gallstone model is decreased gallbladder emptying due to decreased gallbladder sensitivity to cholecystokinin.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic and biopsy findings of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colorectum were studied in 37 patients with amyloidosis involving the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic examinations revealed fine granular appearance, polypoid protrusions, erosions, ulcerations, and mucosal friability in many cases. These findings were most marked and noticed most often in the second portion of the duodenum. The frequency of amyloid deposition in the biopsy specimens was as follows; 100% in the duodenum, 95% in the stomach, 91% in the colorectum, and 72% in the esophagus. The degree of amyloid deposition in the duodenum, which was the highest of the entire gastrointestinal tract, significantly correlated with the frequency of endoscopic findings such as fine granular appearance and polypoid protrusions. Therefore, the two endoscopic findings described above are characteristic of this disease and may reflect amyloid deposition in the mucosa or submucosa of the alimentary tract. Our results indicate that for a diagnosis of amyloidosis, it is important to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the duodenum, using endoscopy and biopsy techniques.\r"

The grain concentration indicating HBV DNA on autoradiography in hepatocytes in areas of DRPM was less than that in areas not appearing as DRPM. These findings suggest that replication of the hepatitis B virus is reduced in pre-nodular lesions which are appearing as DRPM in chronic active hepatitis.\r"

Changes observed during colonoscopy were then correlated with the type of anesthesia and level of sedation, position of the endoscope and presence of looping, existence of comorbid medical conditions, concomitant medication usage, and the occurrence of endoscopy induced pain. Clinically important changes in O2 saturation (54%) and in blood pressure (44%) were most frequently noted. Less frequent were changes in pulse (15%) or respiratory rate (4%). These clinically significant changes were associated with induction of anesthesia or endoscope looping and pain in 58 to 62% of the patients. In the remainder of patients, no obvious factor was associated with the observed alterations in physiologic parameters. There was no correlation with presence of comorbid medical conditions, use of concurrent medication, dose of anesthesia, level of sedation, and/or colon segment reached by the endoscope. Although there was no apparent morbidity associated with the induced changes in physiologic parameters, these data suggest that certain patients may be at increased risk of procedure-related morbidity and support the need for physiologic monitoring in high-risk patients.\r"

Patients who received supplemental oxygen were less likely to become hypoxic (pulse oximeter reading, SpO2 less than 90%) than those who breathed room air (10 of 28 vs. 22 of 28, p less than 0.005). Similarly, the total time during which SpO2 was below 90% was significantly less in patients receiving nasal oxygen (0.7 +/- 0.3 min) than in patients breathing room air (9.7 +/- 1.9 min, p less than 0.001). Minimum oxygen saturations were significantly higher in patients receiving oxygen (90.6 +/- 0.8%) than in patients breathing air (86.5 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001). In patients breathing air, there was a significant negative correlation between the dose of meperidine and the minimum observed oxygen saturation; conversely, midazolam dose did not correlate with indices of hypoxemia. The authors conclude that administration of oxygen via nasal prongs can reduce the risk of hypoxemia during colonoscopy. However, since hypoxemia may occur even when nasal oxygen is given, continuous monitoring of arterial oxygenation is recommended.\r"

The cumulative survival rate was compared with these peritoneoscopic parameters. The usefulness of peritoneoscopic and histological findings in the prognosis of liver cirrhosis was evaluated using the proportional hazard model of Cox. Significant differences were observed in the cumulative survival rate with respect to the degree of development of regenerating nodules, the size of the right hepatic lobe, the formation of small lymphatic vesicles, and the degree of splenomegaly. Analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model indicated that peritoneoscopic findings are of greater clinical use than histological findings in determining the prognosis of liver cirrhosis.\r"

In addition, function of the stomach in these patients was assessed by determination of gastric acidity and fasting serum gastrin level and by gastrin response test to a beef extract. In the investigation of the gastric mucosal pattern in hyperplastic polyp patients, Type A gastritis (involving the corpus but sparing the antrum) was most frequently found. On the other hand, extensive intestinal metaplasia from the pyloric antrum to the corpus was most often noted in the adenoma-bearing stomach. Hypergastrinemia was more marked in hyperplastic polyp patients, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperplastic polyps. Attention should be paid to the detection of cancer in areas without polyps during endoscopic observation and reexamination of patients. On these occasions, the characteristics of the background mucosa for each type of polyp should be kept in mind.\r"

Prior to treatment, patients had a mean dysphagia grade of 3. After one treatment, dysphagia grade had improved to a mean of 1.5. An optimum dysphagia grade (mean, 0.9) was achieved after a mean of 1.6 injection treatments. Treatments were repeated as symptoms recurred, with a mean period between repeat treatments of 32 days (median, 26). There were no complications associated with ethanol-induced tumor necrosis (ETN). Mean patient survival was 140 days (median, 109). These results suggest that ETN has considerable potential for palliation of malignant dysphagia in selected patients.\r"

The neorectum and the ileum above were examined in all cases and multiple biopsies were taken. No symptoms of pouch inflammation were found in 41 subjects; 80.5% of these had non-macroscopic lesions and 19.5% had focal lesions such as congestion, petechiae, mucous hypersecretion (5), or single ulcers (3). None of these developed pouchitis. Pouchitis was observed in the other six subjects, who all underwent surgery for ulcerative colitis and developed 14 clinical episodes of pouchitis during the follow-up. In these cases the entire neorectum mucosa was always affected by the lesions which, in 50%, also extended to the ileum above. The most common endoscopic features (71.4%) were congestion, potechiae, oozing areas, mucous hypersecretion, and multiple superficial ulcers. In half the remaining cases (14.3%) the neorectum showed the features, described above, while the upper ileum was affected by deep round or irregular ulcers within normal mucosa; Crohn's disease was excluded in these cases. In the remaining 14.3%, pouchitis showed a pseudomembranous feature. In our experience, the endoscopic pattern of pouchitis is polymorphic. Although an ulcerative colitis-like feature prevails, pseudomembranous and Crohn's ileitis-like features may also be present.\r"

Consenters had significantly more positive feelings about being used as a subject; giving urine; giving blood; having a physical examination; being interviewed; taking an IQ test; answering questions; being a subject to help others; finding out about problems and as a way to pass time; and telling an interviewer the truth. Reasons given for partaking in research were the personality of the interviewer, interest in the project, and benefits to subject or others.\r"

  ".W": "Various staff behaviors in a nursing home were sampled seven times a day, 5 days a week over 37 months and were coded separately for LPNs, RNs, and NAs. The behavior most frequently observed was patient care, which occurred during 56.9% of the samples. We observed staff interacting with patients during 10.7% and with other staff during 19.5% of the samples. The LPNs displayed significantly more patient care behaviors and NAs significantly more nonwork behaviors than other nursing staff. RNs displayed the least nonwork behavior. We conclude that nursing staff devote most of their time to patient needs and relatively little time to nonproductive activities.\r"

The attendant cognitive changes that occur in the Alzheimer's patient present the caregiver with many, often conflicting, challenges to a couple's sexual functioning. This case study highlights these issues by describing a man who reported an erectile dysfunction directly stemming from stressful changes that had occurred in his relationship to his wife who had Alzheimer's disease. General themes and relevant hypotheses are derived and clinical practice implications are explored.\r"

This paper describes the assessment technique used by an interdisciplinary staff on a coed Alzheimer's disease unit. Two case studies are presented to highlight how the assessment led to the treatment decisions.\r"

An increase in absenteeism and knowledge of aging services was associated with attendance at the seminar series. Among the service options, only care planning and support groups were utilized by employees. A decrease in negative affect was associated with each of the options.\r"
