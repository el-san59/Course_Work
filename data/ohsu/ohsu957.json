  ".W": "Pericardial effusion is reported to occur in 30% to 80% of subjects with hypothyroidism. However, these earlier studies were conducted when the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was only suspected and was confirmed only in the presence of classic clinical features. In contrast, the diagnosis has recently been established in the early mild stage or more often in an asymptomatic stage because of more frequent or routine determinations of thyroid function tests, especially in the elderly. Thus the subjects in the older studies were severely hypothyroid at the time of diagnosis and may not be representative of the present hypothyroid population. For this reason, 30 subjects with hypothyroidism were evaluated with echocardiography to reassess the evidence of pericardial effusion in this disorder. Only two subjects demonstrated pericardial effusion, and in only one of them with severe disease could the pericardial effusion be attributed to hypothyroidism, since it resolved on the patient's attaining the euthyroid state. Thus the incidence of pericardial effusion was only 3% to 6%, depending on the inclusion of one or both subjects, an extremely infrequent occurrence when compared with that of previous studies. Moreover, the occurrence of pericardial effusion in hypothyroidism appears to be dependent on the severity of the disease. Thus pericardial effusion may be a frequent manifestation in myxedema, an advanced severe stage, as previously found, but a rare association of hypothyroidism, an early mild stage, because of the timeliness with which the latter condition is nowadays detected.\r"

  ".U": "91063338\r", 
  ".W": "In color Doppler flow studies, \"variance\" is an important display modality for diagnosing stenotic, regurgitant, and shunt lesions. Variance, a mathematical calculation based on the variation in the Doppler signal frequencies, has been reported to reflect the degree of flow disturbance. A wide-band pulsed Doppler spectrum results in a larger degree of variance. It has been suggested that variance area (green color or mosaic area) might provide useful quantitative information regarding the severity of stenotic, regurgitant, and shunt lesions. Since ultrasound machine settings may affect the color Doppler variance image, we evaluated in 101 free jet experiments the effect of packet size (eight versus four samples per line), pulse repetition frequency (3.9 versus 5.2 kHz), frame rate (11 versus 22 frames per second), system gain (+15 dB versus -15 dB), transmit power (high versus low), and moving target indicator (MTI) filter setting (high versus low) on variance display. The variance area was planimetered using an image analysis computer. The following machine parameters were inversely correlated with variance area: (1) packet size (p less than 0.01), (2) pulse repetition frequency (p less than 0.001), and (3) frame rate (p less than 0.05). Both system gain (p less than 0.001) and wall filter setting (p less than 0.01) showed a direct correlation with variance area. We conclude that machine factors must be standardized in evaluating stenotic, regurgitant, and shunt lesions by color Doppler variance display imaging.\r"

The clinical relevance of vasoselectivity and its impact on drug selection are discussed. The newer calcium antagonists are important alternatives to older agents and may be associated with improved tolerance and a reduced incidence of adverse effects. Their place in therapy has yet to be defined by comparative studies of efficacy and safety.\r"

Data from the NHDS and National Vital Statistics System were used to assess its impact in the U.S. In 1985 to 1987, an estimated 229 thousand men and 184 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of chronic PAODE. Discharge rates were much higher in men and increased sharply with age. Lower extremity arteriography was performed during 88 thousand hospitalizations and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass procedures were done during 31 thousand hospitalizations per year. Numbers of procedures increased markedly since 1979. An estimated 60 thousand men and 50 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of acute PAODE. Embolectomy or thrombectomy of lower limb arteries was listed for 28 thousand discharges per year. Few deaths were attributed to PAODE. Although these data are limited by likely incomplete reporting and by the nonspecificity of diagnostic codes, they provide an indication of the magnitude of the problem. An aging population and advances in surgical techniques suggest continued monitoring using multiple data sources. Vigorous primary prevention programs are needed to lessen the impact of all atherosclerotic diseases.\r"

The extraordinary satisfactory functional responses seen in patients who undergo cardiac transplantation clearly identify the primary cause as the status of the heart itself, whatever the pathophysiologic adjustments of the neuroendocrine system, and interventions of the wide variety of drugs. Since donor hearts are unlikely to be available even from younger sufferers of these clinical syndromes, prevention must be the hallmark. Protection of the viability of myocytes, such as in acute myocarditis and acute infarction, is essential. Myocardial collagen undergoes continual synthesis, and production is greatly stimulated in the presence of hypertrophy caused by increased wall stress. It is possible that excess collagen is intimately involved with diastolic ventricular dysfunction, but that this may be a reversible process if the collagen-producing stimulus is removed. Thus reduction in wall stress and reversibility of ventricular hypertrophy appear to be promising directions. However, to limit the catastrophic effects of chronic heart failure, early recognition of the precursors of these syndromes, prevention of progression, and surgical intervention in valvular heart disease at an optimal point in time are essential.\r"

  ".W": "Heart failure results not only in a fall in cardiac output but also in a redistribution of blood flow favoring some regional beds (the brain and the heart) at the expense of others (the kidney and working skeletal muscle). The chronic resting hypoperfusion of striated muscle is further compromised with exercise. Maladaptive vasoconstrictor control mechanisms prevent the redirection of blood flow from nonworking muscle and liver to working muscle. This inappropriate preservation of nonworking organ perfusion further compromises the functional capacity of working muscle and is associated with evidence for metabolic deconditioning with reduced oxygen extraction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the clinical response to the inotropic and vasodilator therapy used in heart failure is in part dependent on the differing regional blood flow profiles of the various agents studied. The ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to redirect blood flow away from nonworking regional beds to exercising muscle, and thereby to reestablish an appropriate physiologic response to changing metabolic needs, may be the overriding reason for their long-term efficacy. Certainly in the future the comprehensive therapy of heart failure will have to take into consideration not only central hemodynamic but also regional blood flow/supply and demand issues.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of pathophysiologic mechanisms, the medical therapy of today for chronic heart failure is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of the vasodilator drugs and the inotropic drugs are presented. Finally, the therapeutic value of the inodilator drugs, which combine the central myocardial effects of positive inotropic agents with those of peripheral vasodilators, is discussed. In particular, the orally available dopaminergic agents, such as ibopamine, which interact with beta-receptors in the heart (mediating a positive inotropic effect) as well as with dopaminergic receptors in the peripheral vessels (mediating a systemic vasodilator effect) and in the kidneys (potentiating the natriuretic effect of diuresis), seem to be an advancement in the modern medical therapy of chronic heart failure. Data are shown during long-term treatment with ibopamine, in which the sustained clinical benefit in heart failure was not diminished, despite a decrease of the adrenergic receptors in blood cells. Dopamine plasma concentration was permanently normalized during long-term treatment. The discrepancy between clinical improvement and the measured adrenergic downregulation may be due to the interference of the inodilator with neurohormonal systems at multiple sites and is probably independent of receptor activation. It is suggested that the biosynthesis of noradrenaline is improved by increasing intracellular dopamine transport.\r"

  ".W": "In the sympathetic nervous system the physiologic effects of the endogenous catecholamines noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) are mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors (ARs). Both AR-types can be subdivided into two major subtypes: alpha-ARs into alpha-1 (predominant effect: vasoconstriction) and alpha-2 (presynaptic: inhibition of NA-release; postsynaptic: vasoconstriction), beta-ARs into beta-1 (cardiac effects, renal renin release, and lipolysis) and beta-2 (presynaptic: facilitation of NA-release; postsynaptic: vascular, bronchial, and uterine smooth muscle relaxation, glycogenolysis and possibly part of the A-mediated cardiac effects). During the last 30 years growing evidence has accumulated that dopamine (DA), the third endogenous catecholamine and the immediate precursor of NA, may also cause peripheral effects through stimulation of specific DA-receptors, in addition to its known action at alpha- and beta-ARs. It is now well accepted that at least two different DA-receptors are present in many peripheral tissues (DA1 and DA2), including those of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system. They seem to be involved in dilation of certain vascular beds, inhibition of NA-release during nerve stimulation, natriuresis, and aldosterone release. In chronic heart failure cardiac beta-AR function decreases (presumably due to endogenous \"down-regulation\" by the elevated catecholamines), and this decrease is related to the severity of heart failure (judged clinically by New York Heart Association functional class). The human heart contains both functional beta-1 and beta-2 ARs; cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 ARs seem to be differentially affected by different kinds of heart failure; in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy beta-1 ARs are selectively reduced, whereas beta-2 ARs are nearly normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three months of treatment with a placebo produces a reduction in symptoms in 25% to 35% of patients, an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure, and an increase in exercise tolerance of up to 90 to 120 seconds. Physicians commonly seek to maximize the \"placebo effect,\" since the goal of treatment in the clinical setting is to improve the quality of the patient's life. On the other hand, clinical investigators seek to minimize the \"placebo effect,\" since the goal of a research study is to test the hypothesis that the new drug is superior to a placebo.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of myocardial contractility, reflexly enhanced vasoconstriction, and neuroendocrine excitation are the pathophysiologic hallmarks of low-output heart failure. Drugs that counter both consequences afford considerable therapeutic potential in retarding and perhaps even in staying the consequences of the syndrome. Ibopamine possesses such potential through its unique ability to stimulate both dopaminergic- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the heart and circulatory system. Stimulation of dopaminergic- receptors and beta 2-adrenoreceptors results in vasodilatation in all regional vascular territories. beta 2-Adrenoreceptor agonist activity also affords mild positive inotropic activity in the heart, whereas stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic- receptors (DA2) attenuates the increased sympathetic neural outflow. The drug also suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in addition to having a direct natriuretic activity. The pharmacodynamic effects of ibopamine, exerted through its metabolite epinine, are translated into measurable therapeutic benefits in patients with chronic heart failure. The increase in peripheral blood flow induced in all regional vascular territories, including the kidneys, is associated with increased cardiac output and stroke volume and reduction in left ventricular pressure work, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen consumption. Plasma norepinephrine, angiotensin, and aldosterone are also reduced, and renal sodium excretion is enhanced. These hemodynamic and neuroendocrine activities, which are not subject to tolerance during sustained administration of the drug, are accompanied by clinically significant improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, and the New York Heart Association classification of disability. More important, no proarrhythmic effects have been observed during sustained treatment, and the minimal side effects observed during long-term treatment enhance the safety profile of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cardioprotective effect of amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine derivative, was studied in 2 experimental models of ischemia and reperfusion. Isolated and blood-perfused feline hearts were made globally ischemic for 60 minutes and then reperfused for 60 minutes. Alterations of left ventricular developed pressure and compliance were monitored in both amlodipine-treated hearts and saline-treated control animals. Changes in perfusion pressure indicated that amlodipine significantly reduced myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary vascular resistance. Furthermore, a progressive increase in resting left ventricular diastolic pressure indicated that amlodipine, administered before the onset of global ischemia, attenuated the development of ischemic contracture. Return of contractile function 60 minutes after reperfusion and maintenance of tissue concentrations of electrolytes were significantly better in the amlodipine-treated group than in the control animals. In intact canine hearts, regional myocardial ischemia was induced for 90 minutes, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Although the hemodynamic variables and the size of the region of risk did not differ significantly between treated animals and control animals, the infarct size was significantly smaller in the amlodipine-treated group than in the control animals, and a gradual reduction in coronary blood flow was observed in the control group that was prevented in the amlodipine group. A comparison of these findings with those observed with oxygen radical scavengers also is discussed. A detailed report of these studies was published in The American Journal of Cardiology (1989;64:101I-116I). This review is included here to maintain continuity of the symposium for the convenience of the reader.\r"

These therapies are aimed at improving myocardial perfusion with the ultimate improvement or restoration of myocardial function. Two-dimensional echocardiography with digital storage and display is an ideal technique for temporally monitoring regional ventricular function and the effectiveness of interventional therapy. By design, 2-dimensional echocardiography is noninvasive and can be performed conveniently at the bedside. For these reasons, echocardiography is the principal imaging technique at Indiana University Hospital for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Computer retrieval of echocardiograms can be achieved in about 10 seconds at the nurses' station in the coronary care unit. With the availability of such an examination, the physician has a better understanding of the site, size and function of the infarct area. The state of the noninfarcted myocardium is also assessed and may be critical to the patient's prognosis. With the digital recordings, serial studies can be displayed side-by-side, making it easier for the physician to follow the natural history or to judge the effect of therapy. Echocardiography also is useful in identifying many complications that can occur with myocardial infarction. For these reasons, and because echocardiography will also show related cardiac problems, it is indispensable in the management of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

They are efficacious for the treatment of vasospastic, fixed atherosclerotic and mixed angina; they reduce the incidence of silent ischemia; and they have been shown to reduce postmyocardial infarct angina. Experimental data suggest that they may have certain cardioprotective properties in cases of acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, stunned myocardium, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and atherosclerosis. Moreover, they have been shown to improve exercise performance, as well as the diastolic abnormalities in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In animals, they may delay or reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis after coronary occlusion or coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion, and in low doses that do not alter the hemodynamic profile, they have been shown to enhance the return of ventricular function in animals with stunned myocardium. However, the early first-generation calcium antagonists (nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem) have not been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size or to enhance survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction. There now are clinical studies that suggest that, unlike beta blockers or nitrates, nifedipine may slow the development of atherosclerotic progression in humans over a 2-year period, and it seems likely that in the 1990s there will be further expansion of the use of calcium antagonists for not only angina and hypertension but also for aspects of cardioprotection. That calcium antagonists may delay, prevent or possibly regress atherosclerotic lesions is an exciting possibility.\r"

More recently, the calcium antagonists have been under investigation for their potential protective role in atherosclerosis. Coupled with these new possibilities for therapeutic use are the development of new, long-acting, tissue-specific calcium antagonists. Amlodipine belongs to this group, and although it is a dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist, its pharmacologic profile differs from that of other dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonists. Differences include: different pH optimum for receptor binding, different rates of association and dissociation, and differences in allosteric interaction with the diltiazem and verapamil binding sites. Amlodipine, when given orally to rabbits receiving a high-cholesterol diet, reduces atheroma formation. Evidence of its ability to protect the vasculature is provided by its ability to significantly increase (p less than 0.001) survival in stroke-prone hypertensive rats.\r"

Expression of c-myc is inhibited in the first 24 hours of mithramycin exposure (in contrast to actin gene expression, which is unaffected). Nuclear runon transcription of c-myc by nuclei isolated from mithramycin treated cells is decreased, indicating inhibition of transcription initiation. However, treatment of isolated nuclei with mithramycin also results in decreased c-myc transcription. Thus, inhibition of c-myc expression by mithramycin in these cells appears to occur at the transcriptional level and is most likely mediated at both the transcription initiation and elongation level. This suggests that mithramycin selectively interacts with the G-C rich c-myc promoter, preventing formation of the c-myc transcription initiation complex.\r"

There was no difference in the maximum rate of superoxide production by primed and unprimed PMNs stimulated with either high (2 x 10(-6) M) or low levels of PMA (2 x 10(-8) M). Following stimulation with high levels of PMA, primed PMNs demonstrated a significantly shorter lag period than unprimed cells (103.3 +/- 14.4 vs. 142.1 +/- 21.7 seconds) and larger amounts of superoxide generated in the intervals between 100 seconds (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.3 nmol/10(6) PMNs) and 300 seconds (14.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 12.2 +/- 1.1).

The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) manifests several defects in calcium metabolism that may contribute to its hypertension. Blood pressure and bone mineral status were measured in SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) as a marker of whole animal calcium metabolism. In addition, the effect of alterations in dietary calcium and sodium on bone status were examined. At 6 weeks of age, seven male SHR and seven male WKY were placed on a control diet. At the same age, 28 SHR and 28 WKY were randomized to four diets containing either 2.0% or 0.1% calcium and 1.0% or 0.25% sodium. Four markers of bone mineral status were analyzed: bone density measured by direct photon absorptiometry, and total bone calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium content measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The SHR exhibited significantly lower levels (p less than 0.001) of bone density and bone magnesium content than the WKY, whereas bone phosphorus and calcium did not differ between the two strains. The 2.0% calcium diets resulted in increased bone density and bone calcium content, and lower bone magnesium in both strains. The 1.0% sodium diets were associated with decreased bone density in the SHR, but not in the WKY. These findings identify another indicator of disturbed calcium metabolism in the SHR that may be related to impaired renal calcium handling. They are consistent with previously reported reductions in renal calcium reabsorption and decreased intestinal calcium transport in older SHR.\r"

Advances in protein biochemistry and molecular genetics have provided the tools for the bulk production of these hormones for clinical application. Clinical trials of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-3 have all demonstrated significant effects on the peripheral blood counts of the recipients. The clinical usefulness of at least two of these agents in ameliorating post-chemotherapy myelosuppression, in the treatment of other cytopenias, and in enhancing engraftment after bone marrow transplantation has already been demonstrated. Potential applications to the therapy and diagnosis of other clinical disorders is under study. The history of the elucidation of these growth factors, our current understanding of their properties, interactions, and clinical effects, and the potential prospects for their future use in the manipulation of human blood cell production are the subject of this review.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic epidemiology studies have indicated that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) occurs in caucasians with a frequency of 3 to 13 per thousand. Clinical recognition however occurs far less frequently. The disparity is best resolved by defining HH as homozygosity for the HLA-linked hemochromatosis allele, regardless of the total body iron burden. Variability of clinical expression is explained in part by physiologic iron loss in women but variability in males may be due to environmental factors, gene-gene interactions or polymorphisms in mutated hemochromatosis alleles. Although clinical variability is great, the laboratory phenotype of HH is fairly constant and is marked by elevation of the transferrin saturation. The elevated transferrin saturation occurs early in life, before organ iron loading occurs and can be used as a screening tool to detect HH before organ damage occurs. Cloning and characterizing the HH gene, which is located within 1 centimorgan of the HLA-A locus should resolve some of the issues concerning clinical variability.\r"

In its defense against these environmental challenges, however, the lung responds through a limited number of pathophysiologic mechanisms. This is well illustrated by a group of diseases which are collectively referred to as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This syndrome includes a very large number of different diseases. However, in the United States, only farmer's lung, bird-breeder's lung, and ventilation hypersensitivity pneumonitis occur with any significant frequency. Each of these is characterized by flu-like symptoms, in conjunction with a pneumonitis consisting of lymphocytic granulomatous infiltration of the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. This disease is caused by the inhalation of antigenic material which usually originates from the dusts of organic material. A host of different dusts and antigens have been described in conjunction with hypersensitivity pneumonitis but each leads to the same characteristic clinical syndrome. Thus, each of the diseases shares similar clinical features but differs primarily with respect to the nature of the exposure and causative antigens. The clinical features, pathogenesis, course, prognosis, and treatment of these related diseases are reviewed.\r"

  ".U": "91063458\r", 
  ".W": "One of the exciting recent developments in endocrinology research has been the introduction of the somatostatin analog, octreotide into clinical practice. Octreotide provides a new therapeutic tool for diseases in which somatostatin or somatostatin-like products are secreted abnormally. Unfortunately, early experience was obtained largely with uncontrolled, compassionate drug use. When clinical information regarding octreotide is critically reviewed, evaluation is hampered by the lack of long-term studies with adequate numbers of patients and controls. Nevertheless, the information available does indicate that octreotide is promising in the acute treatment of some of the manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome, including carcinoid crisis. Similarly, octreotide ameliorates symptoms of other gut neuroendocrine tumors, particularly vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-secreting tumors. Octreotide also has potential in the management of growth-hormone-secreting tumors. Long-term treatment with octreotide for these diseases requires more information regarding alterations in disease progression and development of adverse effects including variable effects on blood sugar regulation and steatorrhoea. Octreotide also has been used in nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders, but larger studies are necessary before recommendations regarding these applications can be made. The cost of octreotide, as may be expected, is high but is justified for patients with the specific indications outlined in this review. These indications may change as understanding of the drug increases. Octreotide offers promise, particularly as acute treatment for the troublesome symptoms of several neuroendocrine disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immunostaining procedures were used to identify immunoglobulin and complement deposits, to visualize class II antigen expression by proliferating cells, and to determine eventual infiltration by cells of the immune system. Diffuse deposits of IgG, IgA, IgE, C1q, C3c, and C3d were found in epiretinal membranes, whereas numerous cells, including glial or pigmented epithelial cells, expressed HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens. Some macrophages and B or T8 lymphocytes were identified. These results suggest activation of the immune system during the course of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Class II antigen expression could be dependent upon growth-promoting factors and interferon gamma and could play a crucial role in this immune reaction, which resulted in immunoglobulin deposition and activation of complement. However, the eventual role of immune phenomena in the extension of proliferative processes remains to be determined.\r"

The mean age of fathers at the birth of their children with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma (33.7 years) was significantly higher than the mean age of fathers at the birth of their children in the general population (32.5 years) (P less than .05, one sided). Similarly, the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma (31.2 years) was significantly higher than the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children in the general population (29.5 years) (P less than .05, one sided). We further analyzed this parental age factor by measuring the relative risk of age groups and comparing the incidence of sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma in the various parental age groups with the incidence of sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma in the total population. Mothers 35 years of age or older had a relative risk of 1.7 to have a child with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma compared with mothers in the population in general (P = .006, one sided). Similarly, fathers 50 years of age or older had a relative risk of 5.0 to have a child with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma compared with fathers in the population in general (P = .04, one sided). No parental age effect was found in children with nonhereditary retinoblastoma. We conclude that a high paternal and a high maternal age are significant risk factors for sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma.\r"

The apex of the focal detachment was excised by intraocular scissors and removed from the eye by pneumohydraulic expulsion. A fluid-air exchange reattached the retina. The biopsy sites were evaluated clinically and by light and electron microscopy at regular intervals up to 20 weeks postoperatively. The initial five procedures were performed without heparin in the infusion fluid, and they were complicated by severe fibrin reaction and early retinal detachment. Of the remaining 17 eyes, 15 were without intraoperative complication and maintained attached retinas. The biopsy site developed an early ring of hyperpigmentation along the border, and the biopsy bed became increasingly hyperpigmented because of cytoplasmic hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the pigment epithelium. Epiretinal membranes and subretinal neovascularization were observed histologically. Retinal biopsy specimens were reproducible and suitable for diagnostic studies.\r"

We studied 19 eyes with a single exposure to methyl ethyl ketone peroxide that developed clinical patterns of mild injury, moderate injury, severe injury, or delayed keratitis. Delayed methyl ethyl ketone peroxide keratitis may cause exacerbations and remissions of corneal and limbal disease lasting more than 20 years with palpebral and bulbar hyperemia equal to the initial chemical exposure. With repeat exacerbation, further pannus may occur, which can be associated with a poorer outcome. Based on the capability of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide to change DNA to a new weak antigen, we suggest possible methods of therapy to prevent or limit delayed methyl ethyl ketone peroxide keratitis. This proposed type of injury has important implications in studying various limbal and corneal diseases. A major factor in the severity of ocular injury was the length of time from exposure to methyl ethyl ketone peroxide to obtaining a topical ocular local anesthetic to perform adequate lavage.\r"

During re-epithelialization, cell movement was found to occur circumferentially along the corneoscleral limbus and centripetally from the corneoscleral limbus. In no patient did the central corneal defect close before the corneoscleral limbus had first re-epithelialized completely. Normal limbal healing was observed to occur by circumferentially migrating tongue-shaped corneal limbal epithelium. These tongue-shaped projections developed from either side of the remaining intact epithelium and advanced along the corneoscleral limbus until they met. A centripetal movement of cells from the corneoscleral limbus then completed the healing process. In three patients, however, the advancing conjunctival epithelium extended across the corneoscleral limbus before the tongue-shaped projections of corneal limbal epithelium had met. The surface of the cornea covered by conjunctival epithelium was thin and irregular, and later showed peripheral scarring, vascularization, and recurrent erosions.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation.\r"

We examined fixation stability, saccades, the vestibulo-ocular reflex, visual enhancement and suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, optokinetic nystagmus, and pursuit by using digitally sampled, direct current electro-oculography. Patients with blepharospasm exhibited no ocular movement abnormalities. Since quantitative aspects of ocular movements are sensitive to nonspecific brainstem lesions, the absence of abnormal ocular movements suggests that the lesion in blepharospasm is specifically limited to neurons regulating the facial muscles.\r"

All Bacillus species isolates were sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotics (N = 34) and to vancomycin hydrochloride (N = 32); resistance to clindamycin was found in four of 18 (22%) of tested isolates. Although B. cereus was uniformly sensitive to these antibiotics, resistance to clindamycin occurred in four cases in the non-B. cereus group. The microbroth dilution technique confirmed the Kirby-Bauer data. The aminoglycosides were uniformly effective, but the cephalosporins (first, second, and third generation drugs) were consistently ineffective against B. cereus and varied from sensitive to moderately sensitive for the non-B. cereus isolates. Our microbiologic laboratory findings suggest that vancomycin hydrochloride in combination with an aminoglycoside ensures more consistent antibiotic coverage of Bacillus species ocular infections.\r"

A randomized double-blind design was used, and 91 patients scheduled for post-operative pain relief by epidural morphine were studied. Patients received either a continuous epidural infusion of morphine and clonidine (group 1; n = 45) or morphine alone (group 2; n = 46) over the 72 h after major abdominal surgery. In the first 24 h, the dose of morphine was 6 mg per 24 h; during the second 24 h, it was decreased to 4 mg per 24 h; and in the final 24 h, it was decreased to 2 mg per 24 h in both groups. Group 1 patients received clonidine (450 micrograms) during each 24-h period. Additional epidural bolus injections of 2 mg morphine and intravenous meperidine were given on demand. The pain score, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and relative forced vital capacity were measured at fixed times during the first 72 h after operation. Total consumption of analgesics and side effects were recorded. Although the total consumption of analgesics was significantly higher in group 2 (P less than 0.05), pain scores were lower in group 1 than group 2 during the entire observation period (P less than 0.05). Epidural clonidine produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in heart rate and blood pressure, whereas the respiratory rate was not affected. Due to the better pain relief in group 1, the forced vital capacity was increased (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive. By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia. Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively. Ischemia at the same periods was less frequent by the standard ECG system (5.5 and 12.8%, respectively) and least frequent by the Holter recorder (4.6 and 8.3%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated the accuracy of CACI administration of fentanyl using a newly developed CACI device programmed with a well-known set of pharmacokinetic parameters for fentanyl. Patients received diazepam 1 or 2 h before surgery. Anesthesia was induced by a combination of 70% N2O and fentanyl administered by CACI to a predicted concentration of 15-25 ng.ml-1. After neuromuscular blockade and tracheal intubation, the desired plasma fentanyl concentration (setpoint) entered into CACI was 3-6 ng.ml-1, and then the setpoint fentanyl concentration was titrated according to strict criteria of adequate or inadequate anesthesia. Plasma samples for subsequent assay of fentanyl concentration then were taken: at predefined stimuli, when inadequate anesthesia occurred, or 5 min before an anticipated decrease in the fentanyl setpoint. The predictive accuracy of CACI was assessed by calculating for each patient the tenth, 50th, and 90th percentile of the performance error and absolute performance error from each measured and predicted plasma sample pair. Cumulative probability functions for each of these were then plotted. Precision was defined as the dispersion of the tenth to 90th percentile of the median percent performance error for the population and was found to be -31-26%. The median population performance error was -4%, and the median population absolute performance error was 21%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven of the patients were dosed according to the pharmacokinetics described by McClain and Hug, and ten of the patients were dosed according to the pharmacokinetics described by Scott and Stanski. The authors measured the difference between the measured arterial fentanyl concentrations and the concentrations predicted by the CCIP for each pharmacokinetic parameter set. The median absolute performance error (MDAPE) in patients dosed according to McClain and Hug's parameters was 61%, and the MDAPE in patients dosed according to Scott and Stanski's parameters was 33%. The population pharmacokinetics in these 21 patients were analyzed using a pooled data technique. The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl in this population showed a smaller central compartment volume and a more rapid initial distribution half-life than previously estimated for fentanyl. The derived pharmacokinetic parameters described these patients well and also predicted the observed fentanyl concentrations from four previously published fentanyl studies with reasonable accuracy. Comparison of the parameters used by the authors with those of McClain and Hug demonstrated that dosing regimens designed from pharmacokinetic models can be fairly accurate at the times sampled in the original study but may not be accurate at time points not sampled in the original research. The authors concluded that although the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl administered by CCIP are the same as the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl administered by a bolus or constant rate infusion, a pharmacokinetic study using a CCIP may be particularly effective at characterizing the most rapid distribution pharmacokinetic parameters, and thus may provide parameters appropriate for subsequent use in a CCIP.\r"

A battery of psychometric tests, including the Satz-Mogel form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and the Sickness Impact Profile, and various neuropsychological measures were administered by a blinded observer just before surgery and again 3 months later. Analyses of covariance revealed improvements in most measures that were equivalent between groups. The results indicated that there were no cognitive or psychosocial effects of general or regional anesthesia after 3 months in elderly persons undergoing knee arthroplasty. In this patient population, general anesthesia poses no more risk to long-term mental function than regional anesthesia.\r"

We quantified the doses of all sedatives utilized, determined the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), and identified risk factors associated with NAS. We determined peak fentanyl infusion rate, mean fentanyl infusion rate, total fentanyl dose, and duration of ECMO therapy. NAS was observed in 21 of 37 neonates (57%). In both the NAS and non-NAS neonates, mean infusion rate increased steadily during ECMO therapy, from a mean of 11.6 +/- 6.9 (SD) micrograms.kg-1.h-1 on day 1 to a mean of 52.5 +/- 19.4 (SD) micrograms.kg-1.h-1 by day 8. Total fentanyl dose and duration of ECMO were significantly greater in neonates with NAS. We found that neonates with a total dose greater than 1.6 mg/kg or an ECMO duration greater than 5 days had a significantly greater incidence of NAS (chi-squared test, P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.005; odds ratios = 7.0 and 13.9, respectively). With multiple logistic regression, ECMO duration was found to be the most powerful predictor of the occurrence of NAS. We also measured plasma fentanyl concentrations in a separate group of 5 neonates receiving fentanyl by continuous infusion for sedation. Fentanyl concentrations increased steadily during the period of infusion, suggesting the development of tolerance to the sedating effects. We conclude that continuous administration of fentanyl for sedation is associated with the uniform development of tolerance and a significant incidence of dependence. Alternative approaches to sedation should be investigated.\r"

These concentrations of morphine and sufentanil yielded a comparable near maximal hot-plate response latency on day 1 of the infusion. On day 7, the magnitude of tolerance was assessed in each group by establishing intrathecal dose-response curves and ED50 values for sufentanil and morphine given as a bolus injection. Each infused animal was used for a single bolus injection. In all cases, infusion with the opioid resulted in a rightward shift (increase in ED50) for both morphine and sufentanil as compared to saline-infused animals. The magnitude of the shift, however, was different for the two drugs. Thus in morphine-infused rats, the morphine ED50 increased as compared to saline-infused animals by a factor of 44, whereas the sufentanil ED50 shifted by a factor of 10. In sufentanil-infused animals, the respective shifts in the morphine and sufentanil ED50 values were increased by a factor of 9 and 3, respectively. Thus, a significantly greater shift as compared to saline-infused animals was observed in morphine-infused than in sufentanil-infused animals. Conversely, regardless of the opioid to which the animal was exposed, morphine-tested animals showed a greater rightward shift than did sufentanil-tested animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91063588\r", 
  ".W": "Assessment of the effects of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractile function in vivo has been complicated by lack of a reliable, easily quantified, load-independent index of contractility and by the presence of intact autonomic nervous system reflexes. Although several previous investigations in humans and experimental animals have demonstrated that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic effects, this conclusion remains controversial. This investigation reexamined the effect of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractile function when this agent was combined with baseline isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia in chronically instrumented dogs. Contractility was evaluated with the use of the regional preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW)-end-diastolic segment length relationship, a method that provides an accurate, relatively afterload-independent assessment of inotropic state in conscious and anesthetized dogs. Because autonomic nervous system tone may influence the response of systemic hemodynamics to anesthesia in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Two groups of experiments, consisting of a total of 15 experiments, were performed with 12 dogs. Dogs, chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics, including left ventricular pressure and subendocardial segment length, were anesthetized with isoflurane or sufentanil. Thirty percent and 70% nitrous oxide were then administered in a random fashion. Left ventricular pressure-segment length loops were generated after 30 min of equilibration after each anesthetic intervention with the use of preload reduction by partial inferior vena caval constriction, and regional PRSW was calculated. Regional PRSW versus end-diastolic length slope reflected decreases in contractile state when nitrous oxide was added to isoflurane (50 +/- 5 for isoflurane alone to 28 +/- 2 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).min-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide) or sufentanil (73 +/- 8 for sufentanil alone to 52 +/- 5 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).mm-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide). Similar decreases in left ventricular positive dP/dt50 were observed as well, reflecting decreases in contractile function. The results further suggest that the degree of functional depression produced by nitrous oxide is nearly equal when isoflurane and sufentanil groups are compared. This study demonstrates that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic actions independent of changes in autonomic nervous system tone in the chronically instrumented dog.\r"

Under control conditions (n = 15 hearts) APD90 of proximal (false tendon) fibers (289 +/- 6 ms) always exceeded (P less than or equal to 0.01) that of distal (apical) fibers (213 +/- 4 ms). Halothane (0.35-1.07 mM) reduced regional differences of APD90 by producing dose-dependent decreases of proximal APD90 without decreases of distal APD90. The regional actions of halothane were similar to those of low (0.33-1.0 microM) concentrations of the Na+ channel antagonist TTX, which also decreased proximal APD90 more than distal APD90. The actions of halothane in combination with TTX further decreased proximal APD90, whereas the Na+ channel agonist VTD, which increased proximal APD90 more than distal APD90, reversed the regional actions of halothane. Decreasing Ca++ influx by reducing [Ca++]0 from 1.8 to 0.6 mM increased proximal APD90 more than distal APD90 in a manner opposite to the regional actions of halothane. Although there was no difference between the values of APD90 obtained for each region in the presence of halothane at 0.6, 1.8, and 3.6 mM [Ca++]0, the action of halothane decreasing APD90 of proximal fibers was more prominent at 0.6 mM [Ca++]0 because of the increased APD90 of fibers under this condition. The findings are consistent with, but do not definitively prove, the hypothesis that halothane may decrease APD90 of proximal Purkinje fibers by a mechanism similar to that of TTX involving inhibition of plateau-phase inward Na+ current.\r"

Recently, active reflex venoconstriction of 500-1,000 microns O.D. mesenteric veins has been demonstrated. In the current study, the effects of halothane on the reflex responses of similar mesenteric veins were measured. Mesenteric vein diameter and intravenous pressure were measured in 500-1,000 microns O.D. veins from the mesentery of segments of terminal ileum externalized in situ from 27 New Zealand white rabbits anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Mean arterial pressure was measured with femoral arterial cannulation, and heart rate was determined from the arterial pressure signal. In a separate group of six animals, sympathetic efferent nerve activity was measured from a postganglionic splanchnic nerve. Reflex venoconstriction and increases in mean arterial pressure and mesenteric vein pressure in response to bilateral carotid occlusion were attenuated by 0.5% and 1% inhaled halothane but not by superfusate equilibrated with 3% halothane. Decreases in mesenteric vein diameter and increases in mesenteric vein pressure in response to celiac ganglion stimulation were unaffected by both 0.5% inhaled halothane and superfusate equilibrated with 5% halothane. The bilateral carotid occlusion reflex-mediated increase in sympathetic efferent nerve activity was depressed by both 0.5% and 1% inhaled halothane. The effect of inhaled halothane on prestimulation baseline vein diameter was inconsistent. Superfusate equilibrated with 5% but not 3% halothane caused baseline venodilation. These results suggest a mechanism whereby control of venous tone is inhibited by halothane proximal to the postganglionic neuron. This could involve central or ganglionic inhibition.\r"

Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) and glucose utilization were measured in five gray and three white matter areas of lumbar spinal cord 15 min after drug administration with the autoradiographic iodo-[14C]-antipyrine and 2-[14C]-deoxyglucose methods, respectively. Physiologic differences between the groups were minor. Rats in the blood flow experiments that received clonidine 100 nmol had a slightly lower arterial PO2 level (70 +/- 1 vs. 82 +/- 3 mmHg; P less than 0.05), whereas those in the glucose utilization group were mildly hypocarbic (PCO2 27 +/- 1 vs. 32 +/- 2 mmHg; P less than 0.01) relative to control animals. Only animals that received 400 nmol clonidine intrathecally had significant analgesia, as assessed by the tail-flick test. One control animal for the metabolism experiments was technically unsatisfactory and was excluded from data analysis. Subarachnoid clonidine reduced both SCBF and glucose utilization.

  ".W": "The authors' objectives were as follows: 1) to characterize for the first time the relationship between whole body O2 delivery (DO2) and O2 consumption (VO2) in adult conscious dogs; and 2) to asses the effects of the inhalational anesthetic, halothane, on that relationship. DO2 was varied over a wide range in chronically instrumented dogs by gradual inflation and deflation of a hydraulic occluder implanted around the thoracic inferior vena cava to alter venous return and cardiac output. VO2 was measured at different values of DO2 in dogs in the fully conscious state and again during halothane anesthesia. A \"binning\" technique indicated that halothane decreased VO2 (P less than 0.01) at any given value of DO2 over a broad range of VO2. A two-line piecewise linear regression analysis technique indicated that halothane decreased (P less than 0.01) the critical O2 delivery (COD) from 20 +/- 3 to 10 +/- 1 ml.kg-1.min-1 and increased (P less than 0.01) O2 extraction at COD from 31 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 2%. However, the DO2-VO2 plots measured in both conscious and halothane-anesthetized dogs did not exhibit a discrete discontinuity but rather were closely fit (correlation coefficient = 0.98) by an exponential equation of the following form: O2 extraction = B1.(1 - exp (-DO2/B2))/DO2, where B1 is the delivery-independent estimate of VO2 and B2 is the \"delivery constant,\" i.e., the DO2 associated with a VO2 equal to 63% of B1. Halothane decreased B1 (P less than 0.01) from 5.3 +/- 0.1 to 3.9 +/- 0.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 and decreased B2 (P less than 0.01) from 5.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.6 +/- 0.3 ml.kg-1.min-1 compared with that measured in conscious dogs. Thus, compared with the conscious state, halothane anesthesia alters the fundamental relationship between DO2 and VO2 and may have a beneficial effect on tissue oxygenation at low values of DO2.\r"

Administration of intrathecal alpha-2, but not alpha-1 or beta agonists, produced a dose-dependent block of the tail-flick and evoked cardiovascular responses with the order of activity being as follows: dexmedetomidine greater than clonidine greater than ST-91 much greater than methoxamine greater than or equal to isoproterenol.

Without drugs, the halothane MAC was 1.23 +/- 0.07%. In the presence of intrathecally administered dexmedetomidine (0.33 micrograms), the MAC was significantly reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.09%. The intrathecal administration of alpha-2 agonists resulted in a rapid decrease in resting blood pressure and heart rate with the magnitude of hypotension being as follows: dexmedetomidine greater than clonidine greater than ST-91. These data suggest a potent spinal alpha-2-receptor-mediated modulation of somatomotor and autonomic responses to pain.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo covalent binding of halothane biotransformation-reactive intermediates to hepatic protein and lipid was examined in association with the subsequent development of hepatic necrosis in the guinea pig. Oxidative halothane biotransformation was inhibited by the use of deuterated halothane, whereas reductive metabolism was enhanced by low inspired oxygen concentrations. Male outbred Hartley guinea pigs (n = 8) were exposed to either 1% (v/v) halothane or deuterated halothane--with a fractional inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 0.40 or 0.10--for 4 h. Livers removed from half of the animals immediately after anesthesia were evaluated for organic fluorine bound to protein and lipid. The remaining animals were evaluated for a hepatotoxic response up to 96 h after exposure. Only guinea pigs that received 1% halothane at an FIO2 of 0.40 had centrilobular necrosis develop with significantly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase activities. All other treatment conditions significantly reduced oxidative halothane biotransformation, as indicated by decreased plasma trifluoroacetic acid concentrations. These reductions were associated with a significant decrease in organic fluorine bound to hepatic proteins. An FIO2 of 0.10 during halothane anesthesia significantly enhanced reductive biotransformation, as indicated by plasma fluoride ion concentrations. This was associated with a significant increase in organic fluoride bound to hepatic lipids. Centrilobular necrosis did not develop under these conditions. Thus, covalent binding to subcellular proteins by the trifluoroacetyl acid chloride intermediate generated by oxidative halothane biotransformation is implicated as a mechanism of centrilobular necrosis in guinea pigs. Binding to lipids by reductive pathway generated free radicals does not appear to be involved in production of the lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Little information exists about which spinal meninx is the principal permeability barrier between the epidural space and the spinal cord or about what physicochemical properties of drug molecules govern their meningeal permeability. To better understand these aspects of epidural pharmacokinetics, the authors measured the permeability of morphine and alfentanil through the different components of the spinal meninges-dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater-of dogs and monkeys in vitro. Live meningeal tissue from either species (dura mater alone, pia mater alone, or intact dura-arachnoid-pia) was placed between two fluid reservoirs of a temperature-controlled diffusion cell. The permeability of the tissues to each opioid was determined by placing the opioid in one of the reservoirs of the diffusion cell and measuring the rate at which the drug diffused through the tissue and appeared in the second reservoir. The arachnoid mater was found to be the major meningeal diffusion barrier between the epidural space and the spinal cord. Alfentanil was 3.7 times more permeable than morphine through all three meninges, suggesting that increased lipid solubility increases meningeal permeability. However, neither lipid solubility nor molecular weight adequately explained the difference in permeability between morphine and alfentanil. The authors conclude that this in vitro model has significant utility for studies aimed at predicting in vivo meningeal permeability and hence the potency and rapidity of action of any opioid administered by the epidural route.\r"

The authors' aim was to examine the inotropic, chronotropic, dromotropic, and vascular effects of N2O, compared with its N2 control, on hearts isolated from the guinea pig. Hearts (N = 31) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with Krebs-Ringer solution at constant pressure. Isovolumetric left ventricular pressure (LVP) and its derivative (maximum rate of tension development [dP/dtmax]) were measured by placing a saline-filled, latex balloon into the left ventricle. Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurement of heart rate (HR) and atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT). The venae cavae were ligated, and the right ventricle was cannulated through the pulmonic valve to collect coronary sinus effluent for measurement of coronary outflow O2 tension, adenosine, and inosine. After stabilization and perfusion with 96% O2 (plus 4% CO2), each heart was exposed for 10 min either to 48% N2O or to 48% N2 with 48% O2. After repeated perfusion with 96% O2 for 10 min, hearts were exposed in the reverse order to 48% N2O or 48% N2. In the postcontrol period, hearts were again exposed to 96% O2. Inflow Po2 (in mmHg) was 506 +/- 5 (standard error of the mean [SEM]) during 96% O2 and 258 +/- 5 during both 48% N2 and 48% N2O. Effluent Po2 was 155 +/- 7 during 96% O2, 81 +/- 5 during 48% N2, and 83 +/- 5 during 48% N2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received fixed ratios of medetomidine to morphine, fentanyl, and meperidine of 1:10 and 1:30, 10:1, and 1:3, respectively, by iv administration or 10:1, 3:1 and 10:1, and 1:3 by intrathecal administration, respectively. Data were expressed as the percentage maximal possible effect (%MPE). The A50 (dose producing 50% MPE) for each drug or drug combination was determined from the dose-response curve. Isobolographic analysis revealed that the effect of medetomidine combined with fentanyl, morphine, or meperidine was additive after iv administration. The intrathecal administration of combinations of medetomidine with the opioids produced a synergistic antinociceptive effect in the TF but not HP test. These data confirmed that the interaction between medetomidine and opioids in producing antinociception may be additive or synergistic, depending on the route of administration, drug ratio administered, and level of processing of the nociceptive input (i.e., spinal vs. supraspinal). Moreover, these results were consistent with a spinal role for alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating antinociception. The authors suggest that the interaction between the opioid and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the spinal cord.\r"

Power densities in selected frequency bands were calculated from the electroen-cephalogram (EEG). EEG and systemic variables were determined over a period of 60 min after starting halothane (1% inspired). Malignant hyperthermia (MH) was triggered in all susceptible pigs. Initial changes in the EEG during development of MH consisted of a decrease in total power and a shift to lower frequencies (delta-theta activity) in all animals. These EEG alterations were noted when there was an increase in heart rate, but other systemic variables were still normal. EEG changes in all MHS animals started at an arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) greater than 90 mmHg and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) less than 50 mmHg. In 5 MHS animals EEG became isoelectric at a PaO2 of 61-82 mmHg and a PaCO2 of 53-68 mmHg. Mean arterial blood pressure at this time was 54-66 mmHg. To determine the effects of hypoxia on the EEG in 7 nMHS animals, oxygen was decreased over a period of 45-60 min to 7% inspired. In 7 other nMHS animals, hypercarbia was produced by admixture of carbon dioxide to the fresh gas supply to achieve incremental increases of PaCO2 to 110-120 mmHg. Significant EEG changes during hypoxia comparable to those seen at the onset of MH were noted at a PaO2 below 40 mmHg and during hypercarbia at a PaCO2 greater than 68 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of halothane or isoflurane on contractility and metabolism in postischemic \"stunned\" myocardium were studied in an open-chest canine model in which the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded for 15 min and then reperfused. Regional function in the LAD and circumflex artery (CIRC) areas were measured with sonomicrometry, and metabolic data were determined from simultaneous arterial and venous measurements of oxygen and lactate. Halothane and isoflurane produced equivalent decreases in systolic shortening in both normal (CIRC) and stunned (LAD) areas of the heart. Furthermore, the amount of depression was similar with either halothane or isoflurane. Halothane 0.75 MAC significantly decreased systolic shortening in both the LAD region (from 38.8 +/- 25.9% to 11.0 +/- 21.8%) and in the CIRC region (from 116.7 +/- 24.7% to 87.5 +/- 23.3%). At equivalent MAC concentrations of isoflurane, the values were 42.5 +/- 45.7 to -7.0 +/- 49.9% in the LAD region and 91.5 +/- 11.9% to 66.9 +/- 23.9% in the CIRC area. At 1.5-MAC halothane, systolic shortening in the LAD region decreased from 47.9 +/- 47.2% to -0.6 +/- 20.3% and in the CIRC area from 114.6 +/- 16.8% to 76.0 +/- 18.7%. Isoflurane at 1.5 MAC produced significant decreases, from 23.4 +/- 54.5% to -15.6 +/- 27.1% in the LAD region and from 94.4 +/- 33.2% to 61.3 +/- 28.2 in the CIRC area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isometric responses were recorded from dog and guinea pig basilar artery rings suspended in modified Krebs' solution at 37 degrees C. After precontracting with a voltage (KCl)- or a receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine)-mediated agonist, cumulative concentration-relaxation curves were established for: pure succinylcholine; Quelicin from multidose vials containing 20 mg/ml succinylcholine, 1.8 mg/ml methylparaben, and 0.2 mg/ml propylparaben; Anectine from single-dose vials containing 20 mg/ml succinylcholine; multidose Anectine containing 20 mg/ml succinylcholine and 1.0 mg/ml methylparaben; and methylparaben and propylparaben alone. When required, the endothelium of dog artery was removed by gentle mechanical rubbing and the response to the drugs reevaluated. Both Quelicin and multidose Anectine produced statistically significant (P less than 0.05) relaxation; Quelicin was the more potent of the two. Methylparaben and propylparaben produced relaxation in an additive manner and completely accounted for the relaxation produced by Quelicin and multidose Anectine. The vascular relaxation was found to be independent of the presence of a functional endothelium. Consistent with a nicotinic induced contraction, pure succinylcholine maintained vessel tone. It is concluded that the pharmaceutically ubiquitous preservatives methylparaben and propylparaben but not pure succinylcholine have vasoactive properties in vitro.\r"

These were compared with the metaproterenol aerosol produced by the actuator (provided by Boehringer-Ingelheim [BI]) that was supplied by the manufacturer for use in patients whose tracheas are not intubated. The volume of particles in the respiratory size range (1.0-5.1 microns) delivered to the end of the endotracheal tube were measured using adapters designed by Intec (IT), Instrumentation Industries (II), and Monaghan (MAIS). Particle numbers were measured using a CSAS 100 scattering-aerosol laser spectrometer, and volumes were calculated by assuming the particles were spheres. The authors found that the volume of particles in the respiratory range with the IT, II, and MAIS adapters plus endotracheal tube were 11, 31, and 66%, respectively, of the volume produced in the respiratory range by the BI. When particles likely to impact before reaching the lower airways (greater than 5 microns) were measured, almost none was produced by the adapters plus endotracheal tube, whereas the majority of drug volume in the BI aerosol was in the greater than 5 microns range. It was concluded that the aerosol produced by different actuators differ from each other, that all three produced less drug in the respiratory range than was produced by the manufacturer-supplied actuator, and that large particles are effectively removed by the adapter plus endotracheal tube.\r"

Each patient achieved satisfactory blood pressure control during the infusion period with a mean controlling dose of 7.85 mg/hr. The dose of nicardipine needed for sustained blood pressure control correlated with untreated diastolic blood pressure but not with untreated systolic blood pressure. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of intravenous nicardipine for the treatment of severe hypertension requiring rapid lowering, and they suggest also that the severity of pretreatment diastolic hypertension might be a useful indicator of the dose required for blood pressure control.\r"

NC was administered IV (3 to 7 mg/hr) X 72 hours by titrating dose to mean arterial blood pressure (MABP not less than 10% of baseline), then orally X 30 days. Forty-three patients have been entered; mean age 63 (range 34-89), 25 male and 18 female. Only 3 had CT evidence of infarct on entry. Results have shown improvement in a 100-point (pt) graded exam (40 pts at entry, 68 pts at 3 months). Of 20 patients completing 3 months' evaluation, 17 improved and none worsened. Sixteen out of 20 were at home and 8 had minimal or no impairment. Mean Barthel's index was 72. Mean maximal serum NC level was 75 ng/mL. MABP decreased from 103 (entry) to 83 (72 hours). A larger controlled study is warranted to determine the efficacy of NC for acute cerebral infarct.\r"

  ".W": "Nicardipine, a new 1-4 dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has chemical properties that allow oral and stable intravenous preparations. It is the first intravenous dihydropyridine calcium antagonist available in the United States. Among its drug class it has a unique chemical structure that affords properties useful in the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and other related disorders. In patients with coronary artery disease, intravenous nicardipine has been found to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing afterload and increasing myocardial oxygen supply through coronary vasodilatation. It enhances left ventricular performance and augments coronary blood flow beyond that required by increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Nicardipine may also offer protection from ischemic injury to the heart and central nervous system. Alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, nicardipine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It is safe for use in patients with certain types of conduction disturbances because it does not greatly affect sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction. Additional advantages for nicardipine's use in the management of acute cardiovascular disorders are its rapid onset and short duration of action.\r"

Since the incidence of sickle cell trait in the black population in the United States is 8.5%, we recommend these patients have a preoperative sickle test followed by hemoglobin electrophoresis with quantification if positive. The presence of sickle cell trait should alert the surgeon to the risk of ASI, and factors predisposing to hypoxia should be minimized when possible.\r"

The tip of the fiberoptic probe is placed in direct contact with the surface of the eye to be treated. The technical equipment developed for contact transscleral laser cyclocoagulation is simple, practical, and easy to use. The method was investigated experimentally (on animals and on human eyes to be enucleated) and tried in clinical practice. Only patients facing glaucoma surgery (on whom all other methods of conservative therapy failed) were selected for this kind of treatment. The immediate hypotensive effect was approximately 13 mmHg during the first 24 hours; then there was a gradual elevation of the tension, reducing the initial effect on average by 30%. This method has definite advantages over surgical cyclocoagulation as far as safety and simplicity are concerned. The use of contact fiberoptic systems may open up new possibilities in other fields of laser treatment of glaucoma, including techniques to channel the laser beam to the structures of the anterior chamber angle.\r"

At presentation mean (SD) chronological age was 14.0 (1.9) years, bone age delay 2.7 (1.0) years, standing height standard deviation score (SDS) -3.4 (0.6), and predicted adult height SDS -1.3 (0.7). Final adult height SDS was -1.6 (0.9), measured at 21.2 (2.6) years. There was no significant difference between final height and predicted adult height, but there was a significant difference between final height and measured mid-parental height. Psychological questionnaires showed no significant difference in self esteem, marital, or employment state between the CDGP group and a control group. There was no correlation between self esteem and final height, but 25 felt their growth delay had affected their success either at school, work, or socially and 20 would rather have had treatment to advance their growth spurt. This study supports the more frequent use of active medical treatment to advance growth in boys with CDGP, and shows that although boys with CDGP reach their predicted heights, this is short for their families.\r"

The children had identical facies with deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge with beaked nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, micrognathia, and large floppy earlobes. They were all developmentally retarded. The following abnormalities were found on investigation: hypocalcaemia in all (of whom six of seven had hypoparathyroidism), medullary stenosis and other skeletal survey defects in seven of the eight children, and reduced numbers of T cell subsets in four of four tested.

A 4 year old boy with this condition has been successfully treated by oral administration of a bile acid--chenodeoxycholic acid. He had been jaundiced since birth, grew poorly because of rickets, and had severe pruritus. Plasma transaminase activities were persistently raised. Chenodeoxycholic acid 125 mg twice daily for two months, and then 125 mg daily, cured his jaundice and pruritus, returned his transaminase activities to normal, and eliminated the need for calcitriol for prevention of rickets. On this treatment he has so far remained well for two years. A diagnosis of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered in any child with unexplained chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially if the liver disease is accompanied by a clinically obvious malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins. A simple colorimetric test of the urine confirms the diagnosis and effective treatment can be started.\r"

The mean final SD score (-2.07) of treated patients, however, was significantly higher than the value before treatment (-2.79), which indicated an average absolute height gain of 4-4.5 cm compared with the expected height values. Six of the treated patients developed ultrasonographically detectable nephrocalcinosis with normal renal function. The daily phosphate intake and excretion of patients with nephrocalcinosis was significantly higher than that of patients with normal renal morphology. There was no difference in the doses of vitamin D between the two groups. The average urinary calcium:creatinine ratio of the two groups was similar to and below the hypercalciuric 0.6 mmol:mmol limit. The group with nephrocalcinosis, however, had a higher incidence of hypercalciuric episodes than the group without nephrocalcinosis (12 in 130 observations compared with six in 334 observations, respectively). The benefits and risks of treatment of patients with X linked hypophosphataemia must be further evaluated. The high dose of phosphate seems to be an important factor in the development of nephrocalcinosis in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "The optimum daily dose of thyroxine was calculated for 13 children aged 3-16 years with primary hypothyroidism by titrating their doses at monthly intervals. The condition of the thyroid was assessed by sensitive assay of thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, as well as measurement of total and free thyroid hormone concentrations and systolic time interval ratios. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration was found to be the most responsive to small changes in thyroxine. The calculated optimum daily replacement dose of thyroxine (102 micrograms/m2 or 3.5 micrograms/kg) was fractionally lower than that previously recommended, and was more closely related to surface area (coefficient of variation 8.2%) than to body weight (coefficient of variation 16.2%). Our results suggest that though monthly may be the optimal time interval for increases in the dose of thyroxine, any reduction in the dose should be made more gradually.\r"

A probable aetiology or a disorder of unknown aetiology had been identified in a further 21 (26%) children. To confirm the existing diagnosis, identify new diagnoses, and offer genetic counselling, the parents of 63 children were offered detailed reassessment of their child. Fifty three children were reviewed, and a specific disorder identified in 25 out of 31 previously undiagnosed children. The most frequent diagnoses made were fragile X syndrome and Rett's syndrome. On completion of the survey, 61 of the 82 children (74%) had a specific diagnosis or probable aetiology identified, 12 (15%) had associated disorders such as cerebral palsy, and in only nine of the 82 children (11%) were there no clues at all to the cause of their retardation.\r"

After a further 2.6 to 9 years on a diet containing gluten, small bowel villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia compatible with coeliac disease was found on a second biopsy specimen. The HLA type of the patients was that typical for coeliac disease; all were DR3 positive. Within the families three other patients with coeliac disease have been diagnosed, two earlier and one at the time the first biopsy was undertaken. Four other HLA-DR3 positive haploidentical first degree relatives were found and had biopsies. All four had normal small bowel villous architecture, one had an increased intraepithelial cell count, and another was positive for reticulin and endomysium antibodies. Coeliac disease may exist latent in patients having normal mucosa when eating a normal diet containing gluten.\r"

Two patients with medium sized aneurysms had myocardial infarctions, and one died. Coronary arterial lesions persisted in 17 (23%) patients, most often in younger children. The remaining 16 patients were examined from one month to four years after their acute illnesses, and this group did not have coronary arterial abnormalities. Seven patients with coronary artery lesions have reached school age and require regular echocardiographic examination and exercise electrocardiography. Selective coronary arteriography may be indicated in some patients to identify coronary artery stenosis, which the Japanese experience has shown may progress for several years after the acute illness.\r"

All patients had previously relapsed while the dosage was being reduced or within 14 days of discontinuing prednisolone in the six months before receiving cyclophosphamide treatment (steroid dependent), and had severe steroid toxicity. Thirty two patients were treated with cyclophosphamide for eight weeks, and 41 for 12 weeks. There were no differences between the two groups in age at onset of nephrosis or entry into the study, sex ratio, duration of nephrosis, number of relapses before entry, and follow up period after entry. The relapse free rate of patients treated for eight weeks (25%) was similar to that of those treated for 12 weeks (24%) five years after stopping the treatment, and the mean relapse free interval and the sparing effect of cyclophosphamide (if any) on subsequent treatment with steroids did not differ between the groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide should be used for no longer than eight weeks at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in children with steroid dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Successful outcome was associated with the absence of adverse environmental factors and psychiatric disorders in the child. A logistic regression procedure enabled a risk score to be created so that successful outcome could be predicted. Psychiatric disorder in the child, family stress, and the degree of concern shown by the child emerged as the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of enuresis. The favourable success rates with baseline recording and the enuresis alarm confirm the role of conditioning treatment at the forefront of management of enuresis and the risk score allows outcome to be predicted for the first time.\r"

The hypopituitary patients (n = 70) included multiple pituitary deficiency (n = 23), pituitary deficiency with diabetes insipidus (n = 5), and isolated growth hormone deficiency (n = 42). The patients with multiple pituitary deficiency showed pathological morphological findings in all cases, with stalk and posterior lobe always involved. The group with associated diabetes insipidus had abnormal stalk in four of five cases and posterior lobe not visible in all cases. Only five of 42 (12%) patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency had abnormalities of the sellar area. In two out of four patients with isolated diabetes insipidus posterior lobe was not seen. All patients with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (three with Kallmann's syndrome, one Prader-Willi syndrome, and two idiopathic hypogonadism) appeared normal. In precocious puberty (n = 21) the three patients with onset of symptoms before age 2 years exhibited a hypothalamic hamartoma, whereas in the others with onset of puberty between age 2 and 7 the magnetic resonance image was normal in 17 of 18 patients. The probability of finding a pathological magnetic resonance image was considerably high in our patients with multiple pituitary deficiency, isolated diabetes insipidus, and precocious puberty with very early onset of symptoms. On the contrary, purely functional abnormality is suggested in most patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and precocious puberty with later onset of symptoms.\r"

The proportion of subjects with sperm positive urines increased from pubic hair stage (PH) 1 (6%) to PH 5 (92%) with a steep rise between PH 2 and 3. Estimated median age of first positive spermaturia ('spermarche') was 14.1 years. While at PH 1 to 4 all positive samples were found within the first five days of collection, at PH 5 cumulative frequency of spermaturia increased up to day 8. We conclude that repetitive morning urine sampling is a useful tool in assessing spermaturia and may be helpful to screen for testicular damage in epidemiological surveys.\r"

A normal range for intact parathyroid hormone was also measured. The indices of calcium and magnesium excretion showed no correlation with age or sex so that a common range for all children could be established. The 97th centile values for urinary calcium:creatinine and magnesium:creatinine ratios were 0.69 mmol:mmol and 1.05 mmol:mmol respectively. The calculated tubular maximum for phosphate/litre of glomerular filtrate (TmPO4/GFR) showed no correlation with age with a geometric mean value of 1.67 mmol/l. The normal range for intact serum parathyroid hormone for the age group was 11-35 ng/l, which is lower than the adult normal range using the same assay. There was an inverse correlation between TmPO4/GFR and intact parathyroid hormone in this group of normal children.\r"

Endoscopy with antral and duodenal biopsies for urease test, microaerophilic culture, and histological studies were performed at entry, six weeks, 12 weeks, and at six months. Children with persistent H pylori infection at six weeks were given a further two weeks' course of amoxycillin. H pylori persisted in all children not receiving amoxycillin treatment but cleared in six of the 13 children (46%) treated with amoxycillin. With failure of H pylori clearance at six months, only two out of six (33%) ulcers had healed and 50% of patients had experienced ulcer recurrence. In contrast, when H pylori remained cleared all ulcers healed and no ulcer recurred. Persistent H pylori infection was associated with persistent gastritis and duodenitis despite endoscopic evidence of ulcer healing. Detection and eradication of H pylori deserves particular attention in the routine management of duodenal ulceration in children.\r"

These children were divided at random in two groups of 15 and 14 patients. Both groups were treated similarly except that one group received prednisolone. Both groups were very similar before the onset of treatment for most variables. Tuberculous infection healed in both groups but the group on steroids improved earlier and had significantly fewer complications, both on radiography and bronchoscopy. Only two of the patients on steroids still had progressive lesions: a very young baby probably because he developed two severe viral infections consecutively, and another infant of 7 months whose treatment was unreliable, as the parents were not very compliant. Some patients initially not treated with prednisolone improved only after it was given. Prednisolone treatment is not recommended when the reliability of the treatment cannot be guaranteed, as the hazard of harm would exceed the expected benefit.\r"

It was noted whether dilatation occurred immediately or at 30 and 60 seconds with the buttocks minimally separated, and on subsequent firm lateral traction of the buttocks. The degree of faecal loading was assessed in all children. Anal dilatation was found in 24 (18%) and first appeared on lateral traction in eight (6%). In three quarters of the children with dilatation faecal loading or perianal signs were present. Fissures were found in 35 (26%) children and tags in seven (5%). Perianal redness was more likely to be associated with fissures, and blueness with dilatation. We conclude that there are no pathognomonic perianal signs in childhood constipation and that the technique of anal examination should be standardised.\r"

Concerns have been expressed that newborn screening may cause mothers, who had considered their child to be healthy before diagnosis, to overprotect their child. Some critics of screening also suggest that a period of delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis may help a mother adjust to the reality of the child's lethal condition. This study compared the strength of overprotective child rearing attitudes of 29 mothers whose children were screened (13 had symptomatic children and 16 asymptomatic children) with the attitudes of 29 mothers whose children were diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. Results indicate that newborn screening had not increased a mother's tendency to overprotect her child with cystic fibrosis and in some cases the tendency had decreased. Further, delay in diagnosis when screening was not conducted usually caused mothers considerable personal distress.\r"

Immunofluorescent antibody titre to the varicella zoster virus in the cerebrospinal fluid was 1:32. Cerebral angiography showed evidence of focal vasculitis. He presented again seven months later with an acute exacerbation of seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an old posterior extension of the infarct, but a repeated angiography demonstrated an improvement in the vasculitic process. Cerebrospinal fluid antibody titre was again 1:32. Although this may have been an unfortunate coincidence, a possible association between chickenpox and vasculitis, similar to that reported with herpes zoster, and with potentially significant clinical implications, should be considered. As a definite proof can be obtained only by a brain biopsy, however, which is generally not indicated in such cases, only additional clinical reports can lead to delineation of this association as a definite entity.\r"

Appreciable differences were found, the percentage of the total time during which the pH was less than 4 varying by up to 3.7-fold between the two tests. The differences were largely the result of biological rather than technical variability. From these results estimates were made of the reliability of a single diagnostic study and the size of changes that would be necessary to show the effect of treatment. These findings have a considerable impact on the diagnosis of abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux and its response to treatment whether using 24 hour pH monitoring or any other method of measurement.\r"

The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of aspiration of gastric acid as triggers in asthma was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the distal and into the proximal oesophagus were followed by asthma attacks. Twenty-one subjects (50%) had a pathological total reflux time in the distal oesophagus and six (16%) in the proximal oesophagus. Nine patients had pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux into the distal oesophagus together with symptoms of asthma during the day on which the recording took place. In three of them the episodes of asthma symptoms were significantly correlated with preceding episodes of reflux into the distal oesophagus, and in one subject to reflux into the proximal oesophagus. We conclude that pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children and adolescents with asthma, but it seems to provoke symptoms of asthma in only a few. Symptoms of asthma were more often elicited by exposure of the distal oesophagus to gastric acid, possibly by a vagal reflex, than by aspiration of gastric juice.\r"

This service is an important source of thyroid surgical training for UCLA head and neck residents who rotate through this major affiliate. The purpose of this communication is to review our experience with these cases; to describe our overall surgical strategy; and to detail the specifics of our surgical procedure, which we have developed to safely train residents in the treatment of these challenging cases. This article deals with the specific problems of preservation of the recurrent nerve, the parathyroid glands, and the techniques for reimplantation of injured parathyroid glands; the management of larger, substernal thyroid glands; and our techniques for partial thyroid surgery. In addition, the difficult decisions in the management of thyroid cancer, such as completion thyroidectomy; the management of lymph node mestastases; and how tracheal, esophageal, or laryngeal invasion should be managed are discussed. An initial section describing the general preoperative examination of these patients is also included, so that the proper surgical strategy can be developed prior to entering the operating room.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical management of carotid body tumors requires identification and preservation of neural and vascular structures without compromising resection of the neoplasm. Fifteen patients were examined and treated for carotid body tumors at the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation from 1979 through 1987. The benchmark of diagnosis is bilateral carotid angiography. When neural structures are free of tumor, meticulous dissection facilitates their preservation. Large tumor size increases risk for arterial resection necessitating reconstruction. The use of a vascular shunt minimizes the risk of cerebral ischemia. Postoperative intravenous digital subtraction angiography allows for evaluation of arterial repair. A retrospective review of 15 carotid body tumor resections performed in 14 patients revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence, no mortality associated with surgical intervention, no postoperative cerebrovascular accident, and limited morbidity associated with unavoidable sacrifice of neural elements.\r"

The surgery-treated group, despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors, had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy, of whom 23% had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16% overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease (NX, N1, N2a), while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease (N2b, N3a). Factors that affected survival include neck stage, connective tissue invasion, and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment.\r"

The abnormal activation of these genes in naturally occurring and experimentally induced cancers may have an important role in the expression of the malignant phenotype in cancer cells. Mechanisms for the activation of these genes include chromosomal translocation, point mutation, and DNA amplification. The amplification of specific oncogenes correlates with clinical prognosis in several human malignancies, including breast cancer and neuroblastoma. We examined 21 fresh-frozen human squamous cell carcinomas of the aerodigestive tract for amplification of 10 known cellular oncogenes (c-myc, N-myc, L-myc, N-ras, H-ras, K-ras, erb-B, erb-B2, raf, and int-2), using Southern blotting techniques. Eleven of 21 tumors demonstrated a two-fold to 11-fold amplification of the int-2 oncogene, one member of a family of genes related to basic fibroblast growth factor. Amplification of c-myc, a gene that codes for a DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of cell growth, was seen in two tumors. None of the other eight genes studied were amplified in any of the tumor specimens.\r"

A group of 37 patients who underwent five different combinations of reanimation was analyzed. The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50% of cases. The advantages and disadvantages of the other techniques are described. The clinical situations in which these techniques have advantage over single reanimation techniques are outlined.\r"

The number of sneezes and the symptom scores increased significantly with increasing antigen doses. The levels of histamine and N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase activity increased in the eluted secretions on the antigen day, but not on the control day. The amount of secretions collected also increased per unit of time on the antigen day. We found no significant increase in the concentration level of either histamine or N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase in nasal secretions on either day.

Eleven cocaine abusers were recruited from a drug treatment clinic. Olfaction was assessed using a butanol threshold test, the UPSIT, and a 7-item discrimination test. One patient tested anosmic, one had a mild discrimination problem, and one had a large septal perforation but was normosmic. From the present study, it appears that most cocaine abusers, even heavy users or those with intranasal damage, do not develop permanent olfactory dysfunction. It is not clear what factors may have resulted in complaints of olfactory loss in previous studies.\r"

  ".U": "91064009\r", 
  ".W": "Following cancer resection of the nasal unit, nasal valve malfunction is manifested by the symptoms of nasal stuffiness or difficulty getting air into the nostril. These symptoms occur in cases in which the resection is in the alar crease at the junction with the lateral sidewall of the nose. Wound scar contracture elevates the alar margin and causes the alar and lateral cartilages to move inward forming a visible and palpable shelf on the lateral wall of the nasal vestibule. This displacement of the alar and lateral cartilages and the rigid scar formed between these cartilages render the nasal valve immobile. Since it is easier to prevent nasal valve malfunction than to repair it later, wounds that bridge the alar crease or are located in either the alae or lateral sidewall and come within 1 mm of the alar crease with a total diameter of 1.0 cm should be repaired to prevent nasal valve malfunction. In the process of repairing deep defects, the overlapping region of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage and the lateral cartilage may be stabilized by a conchal cartilage graft. This cartilage graft may be used in combination with reconstruction of the nasal skin with a forehead flap and repair of the nasal lining. In the event that the nasal lining is intact, the cartilage graft may be used with a full-thickness skin graft.\r"

  ".W": "As a step in the application of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for treating advanced head and neck cancers, preliminary information was obtained on the radiation tolerance of the canine common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve to a single, high-dose electron beam. Both sides of the neck of eight mongrel dogs were operated on to expose an 8-cm segment of common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve. One side of the neck was irradiated, using escalating doses of 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 cGy. The contralateral side of the neck served as the unirradiated control. At 3 and 6 months after IORT, one dog at each dose level was killed. None of the dogs developed carotid bleeding at any time after IORT. Light microscopic investigations using hematoxylin-eosin staining on the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein showed no consistent changes that suggested radiation damage; however, the Masson trichrome stain and hydroxyproline concentration of irradiated common carotid artery indicated an increase in the collagen content of the tunica media. Marked changes in the irradiated vagus nerve were seen, indicating severe demyelination and loss of nerve fibers, which appeared to be radiation-dose dependent. Four patients with advanced recurrent head and neck cancer were treated with surgical resection and IORT without any acute or subacute complications. The role of IORT as a supplement to surgery, external beam irradiation, and chemotherapy in selected patients with advanced head and neck cancer needs further exploration.\r"

Although rapid expansion does not increase skin surface area as much as prolonged expansion, it may be helpful in assisting with closure of defects that might otherwise be problematic.\r"

It is presumed that the higher brain system has important roles in discriminating speech. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the function of the auditory cortices of a patient with a cochlear implant before and after sound signal inputs. In this study, we used positron emission computed tomography, which can detect brain activity by providing quantitative measurements of the metabolic rates of oxygen and glucose. Without sound signals, the auditory cortices of the patient showed remarkably low metabolic rates. However, with the cochlear implant device, the activity returned to near normal levels. These findings suggest that the activation of the speech comprehension mechanism of the higher brain system can be initiated by sound signals from the implant device.\r"

We studied 2953 intensive care admissions over a 4-yr period. The overall complication rate was 8%. Accidental extubation and tube blockage were the most frequent events, accounting for a mean of 3.5% and 2.6% of the complications per year, respectively. Complications were more common in smaller children and there were differences between fields of intensive care. None of the complications was fatal or resulted in serious sequelae. None of the children in the study showed clinical symptoms of acquired subglottic stenosis before discharge from hospital, and none has been readmitted for this condition subsequently.\r"

Anaesthetic technique comprised premedication with lorazepam, papaveretum and hyoscine, induction with diazepam, fentanyl, thiopentone, atropine and suxamethonium, and the trachea was intubated. At least 20 min later, during stable nitrous oxide in oxygen anaesthesia, a single bolus of neuromuscular blocking drug was administered and the effects measured at 1, 5 and 10 min. There was a small decrease in heart rate following doxacurium 0.075 mg kg-1, but no other significant or dose-related changes in mean heart rate, arterial pressure or cardiac index with doxacurium. Similar results were found following vecuronium, but the reduction in heart rate was more pronounced.

Before tracheal intubation, a bolus dose of vecuronium 0.08 mg kg-1 was given i.v. followed by repeated doses of 0.03 mg kg-1. The twitch response of adductor pollicis was recorded after supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist using a Myograph 2000 neuromuscular transmission analyser. In the control group, a close correlation was found between PTC and time to first reaction to train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation. This relationship was unchanged when comparing the bolus dose and each of eight consecutive maintenance doses. Further, the degree and the duration of intense block were unchanged after each of the eight maintenance doses. In the isoflurane group, the relationship between PTC and time to first reaction to TOF stimulation remained unchanged after addition of isoflurane. However, isoflurane caused a significant prolongation of the duration of intense block and a corresponding lower PTC in all patients. We conclude that PTC is a reliable method to evaluate intense neuromuscular block caused by vecuronium, even after repetitive administration of the drug and in combination with 0.5% isoflurane.\r"

Neuropsychological tests were performed 6 months after surgery to determine any relationship between ischaemic damage and CBF and administration of nimodipine.

Bupivacaine 1, 5 or 25 micrograms ml-1 or lignocaine 4, 20 or 100 micrograms ml-1 was administered 5 min after the start of perfusion. Both bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 and lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 reduced heart rate significantly. Bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 was associated with a higher incidence of arrhythmias than the other groups. Three hearts in the bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 group (n = 8) and two hearts in the lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 group (n = 8) failed (zero cardiac output) at the end of the experiment. Although there were no significant differences in myocardial lactate and glycogen concentrations between groups, ATP content in the bupivacaine 25 micrograms ml-1 and lignocaine 100 micrograms ml-1 groups was significantly less than that in the control group. The results suggest that myocardial depression and subsequent metabolic deterioration occurred with both the high doses of local anaesthetics; these findings do not account for the apparent increased cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine.\r"

Bupivacaine concentrations were measured in plasma obtained 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after intra-articular injection. Patients receiving bupivacaine with adrenaline had significantly smaller plasma concentrations of bupivacaine at all times than did patients receiving plain bupivacaine. The maximal concentrations of bupivacaine in the plain group (median 515 ng ml-1, range 46-875 ng ml-1) were greater than those in the adrenaline group (median 33 ng ml-1, range 7-125 ng ml-1) (P = 0.001). All patients found the anaesthetic satisfactory.

Immediately after the cold exposure, FAP decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) in both groups. However, during the subsequent 20 min, FAP values increased in relation to upper arm pressure. Finally, FAP values were greater than upper arm pressure in the control individuals, but not in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. These results have implications for non-invasive monitoring of arterial pressure by the finger pressure device. Clinically, significant problems may arise in the monitoring of FAP in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease affecting peripheral circulation.\r"

Vibration at 4 Hz and 8 Hz induced increases in detection time for hypoxaemia and spurious decreases in the displayed SaO2 in some of the oximeters tested. Finger-dependent differences in oximeter performance and pulse rate registration were noted especially in those oximeters without ECG linkage (Ohmeda 3700 and Simed S100). Subsequently, eight different pulse oximeter finger probes were assessed for those characteristics that may predispose to motion artefact. There were marked differences in the mass of the probes, the forces exerted on the test finger and in the force required to displace the probes from the subject's finger. Differences in both the microprocessor programmes and the physical characteristics of the finger probes may explain the observed differences in function. Similar studies should form part of the standard evaluation of new pulse oximeters.\r"

Response to the commands was impaired at 0.1 MAC in three subjects and lost at 0.2 MAC in two subjects. No subject responded at 0.4 MAC. When the subjects were questioned 1 h after exposure, memory of response to commands was lost also at these concentrations. Frequently, those who responded to the command \"open your eyes\" failed to remember having done so; non-responders remembered nothing. At the time of that test, at 0.4 MAC, five of eight subjects had no eyelash reflex. Both recall and recognition of neutral words was lost at 0.2 MAC and greater, but the effect of attention was demonstrated by the memory of a \"shock\" word by four of eight subjects at 0.2 MAC.\r"

After induction of anaesthesia, a gastric tube was inserted and intragastric contents aspirated. Volume and pH were recorded and measurements were repeated on completion of surgery. The median (range) volume was 2 (1-13) ml before surgery and 4 (0-14) ml at the end of surgery. There was insufficient volume to measure pH in all patients. The median (range) pH was 6.7 (4.6-7.4) before surgery in 20 patients and 6.6 (4.6-7.8) at the end of surgery in 28 patients. No adverse drug reactions were noted in mothers or neonates. Omeprazole 40 mg orally twice before elective Caesarean section appeared to be effective in reducing intragastric volume and acidity to acceptable values.\r"

Patients receiving diclofenac had significantly improved postoperative visual analogue pain scores compared with patients receiving placebo medication (P less than 0.05). With fentanyl, pain scores were reduced also, but the effect was not statistically significant. Both fentanyl and diclofenac produced significant reduction in postoperative analgesic requirements (P less than 0.05).

The onset time of analgesia was shortest and conduction delay longest at the dermatome related to the site of injection (L3). Full analgesia was obtained at L1, L3 and S1, although the peak efficacy at S1 was delayed for 120-180 min after injection.

Lignocaine 2% resulted in a decrease in overall amplitude, but its main effect was a significant decrease in the amplitude of the second and third peaks, suggesting an action on the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. A significant increase in latency was found in both the lignocaine and sodium chloride groups.

Haemodilution was more pronounced, and central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index maintained at greater values, after treatment with Dx70. Colloid osmotic pressures (COP) decreased by 1.7 mm Hg after loading with 3% Dx70, and by 5.6 mm Hg in mothers treated with Ringer's acetate (P less than 0.001). The transthoracic fluid index decreased more after hydration with Ringer's acetate (P less than 0.001), indicating an increase in lung water. In spite of these maternal changes, there were no differences in neonatal bioimpedance or values of haemoglobin, PCV, albumin and COP in umbilical cord blood, and only one case of respiratory distress. We conclude that colloids may be preferable to crystalloids for circulatory preload for extradural Caesarean section, as greater haemodynamic stability was maintained and increases in lung water avoided.\r"

Data were consistent with a three-compartment model with a mean (SEM) elimination half-life of 209 (29) min and total body clearance of 40.4 (3.6) ml min-1 kg-1. The mean (SEM) apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 5.0 (2.7) litre kg-1 and volume of the central compartment was 0.6 (0.1) litre kg-1. The mean (SEM) ratio of k12:k21 was 1.4 (0.2), suggesting that, after injection of a single bolus dose in children, propofol is distributed rapidly to the shallow compartment. The mean ratio of k31:k10 suggests that lipophilicity constrains return of the drug to the central compartment.\r"

Following an intubating dose of suxamethonium, atracurium was infused according to a predetermined profile which continually set the infusion rate to maintain stable muscle paralysis and a target steady state plasma concentration when equilibrium between the biophase and plasma had occurred. Atracurium was infused for the first 1 h to maintain a target steady state plasma concentration of 1.0 microgram ml-1. Thereafter, the target plasma concentration was adjusted to maintain 90% muscle paralysis. The maintenance infusion rate required to maintain 90% paralysis was 4.25 (SD) 1.11 micrograms kg-1 min-1, with an estimated steady state plasma concentration of atracurium required to maintain 90% paralysis (Cpss90) of 1.13 (0.24) microgram ml-1. The clearances of atracurium, estimated by the constant infusion rate required to maintain the steady state plasma concentration, at 50-60 min and during estimation of Cpss90 were 3.8 (1.0) and 3.9 (1.1) ml kg-1 min-1 (ns), respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state of atracurium after 1 h of infusion, calculated using the clearance and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 1 h, was 130 (50) ml kg-1. These estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of atracurium are markedly different from those derived from pharmacokinetic analysis of single bolus dose data. Normalization of the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates by lean body mass decreased interpatient variability and improved precision in comparison with the un-weighted data and normalization by total body weight.\r"

Muscle paralysis was stable after 20 min, with a mean absolute drift in muscle paralysis in the succeeding 40 min of 0.13 (SD 0.07)% T1/Tc (height of first twitch/height of control twitch) per min. The plasma samples after 30 min, which were assessed empirically as being in equilibrium with the biophase, had an overall mean bias of 8.0 (SEM 3.7)% (P less than 0.05) and an overall mean absolute prediction error of 16.4 (SEM 2.5)% from the target steady state concentration being delivered by the infusion. The profile was then used to estimate the steady state plasma concentration of atracurium required to maintain 90% paralysis (Cpss90), by manually adjusting the delivered target concentration of the infusion until muscle paralysis was stable at 88-92% inhibition of T1/Tc for 15-20 min, with three plasma samples taken over the next 10 min. Measurements were completed within 60-90 min. The mean Cpss90 of atracurium with propofol was 1.039 (SD 0.224) microgram ml-1 (n = 10), with thiopentone 1.334 (0.378) microgram ml-1 (n = 10), and with opioid anaesthesia 0.915 (0.221) microgram ml-1 (n = 10). These differences in the Cpss90 explain some of the variability in response which occurs with neuromuscular blocking drugs. The technique enables the Cpss90 of a myoneural blocker to be determined by a simple model-independent method.\r"

When the test was performed with less than normal concentrations of contracture-triggering substances (caffeine less than or equal to 2 mmol litre-1, less than or equal to 2% halothane), 70% of the muscles from the patients and only 15% of the controls responded with small contractures (less than 0.2 g). These results should not be taken to indicate that the patients have the genetic trait for MH. The positive and equivocal test results, in addition to the slight contractures, may be accounted for by the electrical after-activity in the cases of pure myotonia, and by increased resting myoplasmic [Ca2+] in myotonic dystrophy. This shows that the in vitro contracture test lacks specificity.\r"

Cardiac output was maintained while mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased in a dose dependent manner. Hepatic arterial and total liver blood flows and oxygen supplies decreased significantly at all isoflurane concentrations. Portal venous blood flow and portal venous oxygen supply did not decrease significantly until the concentration of isoflurane was increased to 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Hepatic oxygen consumption was reduced with 2% isoflurane (P less than 0.05), but this was insufficient to offset the reduction in hepatic oxygen supply and resulted in an increased extraction of oxygen by the liver.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated whether nitrous oxide antagonizes or augments the CNS stimulant action of laudanosine in mice by comparing the mean convulsive doses (CD50 (SE] of a control group and those following pretreatment with 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen for 20 and 180 min. Nitrous oxide significantly increased CD50 from 46.8 (1.4) mg kg-1 of control to 57.3 (1.3) mg kg-1 at 20 min and 53.5 (1.7) mg kg-1 at 180 min. The attenuation of the effect of nitrous oxide at 180 min, suggestive of possible partial drug tolerance, was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that nitrous oxide antagonizes the CNS stimulating action of laudanosine.\r"

Administration of low sodium (glucose) solutions also produced biochemical abnormalities of a severity not documented previously. A survey of the published literature on volumes of crystalloid fluids used supports the contention that, during major surgery, crystalloid requirements may be of the order of 10-15 ml kg-1 h-1 rather than 5-10 ml kg-1 h-1.\r"

This study was carried out to establish whether the immunological changes observed in the lesional DEBR rat correlated with studies of human alopecia areata. The immune infiltrate was characterized using immunoperoxidase techniques on cryostat sections of vibrissa follicles. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to quantify the peripheral blood leucocytes. Some parallels were observed in the infiltration of human and DEBR rat follicles by T lymphocytes. In contrast, pre-lesional DEBR rat follicles, which are not available for investigation in human alopecia areata, were not penetrated by leucocytes and MHC class II antigens were expressed in the precortical region of the epidermal component of these follicles. Quantification of peripheral blood leucocytes showed significant increases in both T-lymphocyte subsets during lesional expression. We consider that the pre-lesional form of the rat may provide important information as a model for the pre-lesional and uninvestigated form of alopecia areata in man.\r"

However, these cells were defective in the repair of potentially lethal damage (D = 2.36 Gy and 3.26 Gy, respectively). The response to radiation of Go T lymphocytes derived from the patient was similar to that of the control. The frequency of mutant circulating T lymphocytes resistant to 6-thioguanine was 17 x 10(-6) which was elevated when compared with age-matched controls.

The effect of in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells and T-cell subsets on the expression of Leu 8 antigen was also determined. In all the skin diseases studied an inverse relationship was found between the proportions of cells expressing Leu 8 and HLA-DR. A deficiency of Leu 8 positive cells was not specific for mycosis fungoides, but was also found in several reactive dermatoses. Stimulation of peripheral blood cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and anti-CD3-PMA resulted in a considerable decrease of Leu 8 antigen expression on day 3 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that the low proportion of Leu 8+ T cells in mycosis fungoides and several reactive skin disorders is not related to malignant transformation or selective homing of Leu 8- T cells, but probably results from local T-cell activation.\r"

Three groups of human subjects were studied, and the guinea-pig ear was also used as a model of NIICR. Cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were all able to produce NIICR in the majority of subjects studied. There was a strong correlation between the susceptibility of each subject to each urticant, but no correlation between the susceptibility to NIICR and age, atopic status or tanning ability. Eugenol caused a reduction in NIICR induced by all three urticants. This 'quenching' effect was apparent even when the eugenol was applied up to 60 min prior to application of cinnamic aldehyde, and its effect was not eliminated by washing. In the guinea-pig-ear model, ear thickening was induced by all three urticants, and this response was inhibited by eugenol.\r"

Ten anatomical regions were tested: forehead, upper arm, volar and dorsal forearm, postauricular, palm, abdomen, upper back, thigh, and ankle. The skin responses were evaluated 24 h post-patch removal by visual scoring and by transepidermal water loss measurements (TEWL). Non-treated symmetrical anatomical regions served as controls. SLS induced a mild erythematous reaction on most anatomical regions except the palm and TEWL was significantly increased as compared with controls. The elderly group demonstrated significantly less susceptibility to SLS-induced irritation for most regions of the body as indicated by visual scores and TEWL measurements. In addition, evaluation of the stratum corneum water content following SLS irritation demonstrated lower responses in the old age group for most regions. The thigh had the highest reactivity and the palm the lowest, in both age groups. These data suggest that young adult skin is more sensitive to SLS than old skin and that SLS irritation varies considerably with respect to region. Moreover, objective TEWL measurements seem to be a better indicator of irritant susceptibility, especially in the elderly, than clinical evaluation by visual scoring.\r"

This study has produced the first in vitro kinetic data on CyA penetration across human cadaver stratum corneum and has shown that addition of the penetration enhancers (PE) Azone and propylene glycol to the CyA vehicle significantly enhanced drug permeation across the skin barrier. Using flow-through permeability cells with 5% w/v CyA (Sandimmun) alone (CyA) or with PE (CyA + PE) in olive oil in the donor chamber, the penetration rate (mean +/- SD microgram/cm2/h) into receptor fluid was 53 +/- 43 (n = 13) for CyA and 660 +/- 175 (n = 7) for CyA + PE. The in vivo efficacy of this formulation was assessed in guinea-pigs undergoing delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). CyA was applied topically at the time of challenge and twice daily thereafter. At 24 h, skin reactions revealed that compared with appropriate drug vehicles, concentrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 5% CyA +/- PE had a significant inhibitory effect upon the erythema response and this corresponded with significant reductions in T-cell infiltrates (0.5 and 5% CyA). No statistically significant reductions in erythema were demonstrated with 0.05% CyA +/- PE, but there was a reduction in the number of infiltrating lymphocytes in sites receiving 0.05% CyA + PE compared with vehicle-treated sites (P less than 0.01). This suggests that PE permitted some penetration of an otherwise non-immunosuppressive concentration of CyA through the skin.\r"

The patients were monitored over a period of 6 months and any relapse recorded. With each combined treatment regimen, CyA plus PUVA and RePUVA, the patients cleared within comparable periods of time (mean treatment period of 5.3 vs. 4.7 weeks after initiation of therapy and 3.3 vs. 3.7 weeks after initiation of PUVA). However, the cumulative UVA dose required for clearance (110.9 J/cm2 vs. 62.1 J/cm2 (P less than 0.05)) and the incidence of severe and early relapses were significantly higher in the CyA cohort. Within 6 months severe relapses had occurred in 58% of CyA plus PUVA but only in 15% of RePUVA-treated patients (P less than 0.001). This suggests that the CyA plus PUVA regimen as performed in this study is less effective than RePUVA.\r"

There was no clinical evidence or history of urticaria or other inflammatory change. Investigations demonstrated a raised plasma cortisol secondary to a left adrenal adenoma.
