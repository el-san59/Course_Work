We reviewed 79 patients treated at NYU/Bellevue Medical Center from 1965 to 1984 to establish a data base from which the controversies surrounding this disease can be viewed. Standard treatment involved a radical inguinal orchiectomy as primary therapy. Stage I patients received adjuvant radiation to para-aortic and ipsilateral iliac nodes, with additional radiation given routinely to the mediastinum of patients with Stage II disease. No major complications were observed. All Stage I patients remain free of recurrent tumor with a median follow-up of eight years. There were 4 deaths from seminoma among the Stage II patients. The use of prophylactic mediastinal radiation for Stage II patients, and observation only for Stage I patients are reviewed in light of our results and other published series. While early evidence suggests that both approaches may be reasonable, their adoption awaits confirmation by prospective trial.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with known prostate cancer presented with cranial nerve deficits and skull metastases during the course of their disease. All were treated with radiation therapy to the base of skull. Of the 11 patients, 10 (91%) responded to therapy. Four of the patients in the responder group had complete resolution of the cranial nerve deficits. This response lasted until their death. One patient had a complete response but later relapsed and is still alive. He is the only survivor of the 11 patients. Partial responses were achieved in 5 patients. These patients had either improvement but not resolution of the cranial nerve deficit or, in cases of multiple nerve involvement, there was response of some of the involved nerves. Four of the partial responders retained the response until their death. One patient achieved partial response but later relapsed with additional nerve deficits. The development of this problem represented a grave prognostic factor as 10 patients died within a median of five months (range 1-16 months) after presentation. One patient is alive nineteen months later but in poor condition with disease progression. Only 1 patient (9%) did not achieve any response to therapy. His treatment was not completed due to deterioration of his general health. The seventh cranial nerve was the most frequently involved either alone or in combination with other nerves. The most commonly used treatment schedule was 3,000 rad in 10 treatments (7 cases). We conclude that effective palliation is achieved though short survival is possible.\r"

Using a retrospective cohort design, patients were matched for age, sex, physical status index (American Society of Anesthesiologists), stone size, and urinary tract obstruction. Twenty-nine pairs of PCN and ESWL patients with complete data were matched. The groups were not significantly different in the matching parameters. Seventy-two per cent of patients in each group (21/29) were stone-free after the initial hospitalization. PCN patients required more auxiliary procedures per patient than did the ESWL patients; in addition, 5 (17%) of the PCN patients had perforation of the renal pelvis and 5 (17%) required transfusions. On discharge, 48 per cent (14/29) of the PCN patients had nephrostomies compared with none of the ESWL patients. The ESWL group had a shorter mean length of stay (2.9 vs 8.7 days, p less than 0.0005) and lower charges in all categories. Total charges were significantly less for ESWL ($9,290 vs $11,796 for PCN, p less than 0.005) as were physicians' fees ($3,391 vs $5,607, p less than 0.0005), room and board charges ($825 vs $2,164, p less than 0.0005), and operating room fees ($313 vs $1,452, p less than 0.0005). We conclude that ESWL is a cost-effective means for treating stones of the kidney and upper urinary tract.\r"

The effect of doxorubicin, cisplatinum, vinblastine, and mitomycin C in different concentrations was tested. Tumors generally showed more resistance than sensitivity. Some tumors showed sensitivity to one or more drugs, but no one drug was persistently effective in all tumors. Our short-term culture technique solved the discrepancy between cell kinetics and test duration found in the Volm test and the problem of nongrowth in the clonogenic assay.\r"

There are indications that long-term mitomycin C instillation therapy improves recurrence rate, progression rate, and survival. Considering prognostic factors in patients with superficial bladder tumors, it is justified and necessary to investigate this regimen in future protocols.\r"

The initial endoscopic session should provide sufficient material to assess accurately the extent of tumor. The tumor is termed superficial if it is confined to the mucosa (Stage Ta and CIS) or lamina propria (T1). Based on the prognostic factors, the clinician decides whether or not intravesical therapy should be incorporated into the treatment plan that is designed to eradicate any remaining postresection tumor(s) as well as retard the development of subsequent tumors. The clinician who chooses to utilize intravesical therapy should be knowledgeable regarding the frequently used drugs: thiotepa, mitomycin C, doxorubicin, and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Each has established efficacy in the treatment and prophylaxis of transitional cell carcinoma. Each also has a different spectrum and incidence of local and systemic toxicity.\r"

After an observation period of 1-3 months, insulin treatment was initiated which resulted in rapid improvement of the glycemic control within 6 weeks. Thereafter glibenclamide or placebo was added to insulin for a further 12 weeks. Glibenclamide improved the glycemic control as expressed by a diminution of blood glucose and HbA1c. This was observed in spite of the fact that the daily insulin dose was reduced by approximately 30% in the glibenclamide-treated group of patients. It is concluded that in NIDDM patients with second failure to glibenclamide ot glipizide therapy, the responsiveness to glibenclamide may be at least partially restored by a short period of insulin treatment. It is suggested that therapy with insulin and glibenclamide is an appropriate treatment regimen for NIDDM patients with second failure to sulfonylurea therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The average radiologist will never compute a probability by using Bayes theorem or carry out a logistic regression, ROC, or cost-effectiveness analysis. Why, then, do we think that radiologists should be familiar with these techniques? Radiologists base many decisions on information gleaned from the published literature. In the past decade, the techniques discussed here have begun to appear in medical (including radiologic) publications. A radiologist with no comprehension of ROC analysis, for example, would be unable to critically assess a study that used this technique to compare MR imaging and CT in the detection of liver metastases and would have to accept or reject its conclusions blindly. A knowledgeable radiologist, on the other hand, could judge whether the study employed proper methodology, and could accept or reject its conclusions on that basis. The four cases presented here are specific examples of generic problems facing the radiologist: predicting the likelihood of disease on the basis of a test result, using several pieces of information provided by a single test to arrive at a diagnosis, comparing the efficacy of radiologic tests or interpretive techniques, and choosing among available tests or procedures on the basis of their relative cost-effectiveness. It is likely, therefore, that the techniques of medical decision making discussed here will appear with increasing frequency in the radiology literature. The list of potential applications is long. Some of the questions that can be addressed by the techniques presented here are: How predictive of IUGR are the various proposed Doppler criteria? How can they be used in conjunction with conventional sonographic criteria to diagnose IUGR? Which technique is best for detecting prostate cancer or for staging known cancer--sonography or MR imaging? Which MR pulse sequence is best for a variety of organ systems and clinical indications? Is routine screening obstetric sonography cost-effective? Applications of statistical decision-making techniques to these and related questions will improve the quality of health care provided by radiologists, if the statistical techniques are done properly and understood by the intended audience.\r"

Gd-DTPA was given either alone or with mannitol (15 or 30 g/l). Opacification of the small bowel after the administration of 1.0 mM Gd-DTPA was superior to that achieved after administration of the 0.5-mM solution. In the absence of Gd-DTPA, the pancreas could be delineated partly in 11 cases. After administration of Gd-DTPA, the pancreas could be well differentiated from stomach and duodenum in 16 of 20 cases. In the absence of mannitol, two of the five subjects had homogeneous opacification of the entire small bowel. When Gd-DTPA was given with either 15 or 30 g mannitol/l, homogeneous opacification of the entire small bowel was obtained in nine of 10 volunteers. Diarrhea not discomforting to the volunteers was noted in four of 20 cases. No abnormal blood tests were recorded after administration of Gd-DTPA. The results suggest that oral administration of Gd-DTPA (1.0 mM) given with mannitol (15 g/l) is effective as an MR contrast agent for the gastrointestinal tract. The formulation was found to be safe in a small series of 20 volunteers.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) and nitroglycerin were compared in 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Both drugs were given intravenously, at an infusion rate individually titrated to achieve a maximal increase in cardiac output and a maximal decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Both drugs produced the typical hemodynamic responses to nitrates, the most prominent of which were decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge, pulmonary arterial and right atrial pressures, and an increase in cardiac output. Several differences in the response to these 2 drugs were observed. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was reduced from 31.5 +/- 3.0 to 19.6 +/- 5.0 mm Hg with nitroglycerin and to 15.0 +/- 3.12 mm Hg with IS-5-MN. Both the absolute and the percent decrease with IS-5-MN were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than those observed with nitroglycerin. Mean systemic arterial pressure was reduced from 89.2 +/- 11.3 to 79.8 +/- 10.8 with IS-5-MN (difference not significant) and to 67.5 +/- 7.7 mm Hg with nitroglycerin (p less than 0.01). The difference, both in absolute and percent reductions, was statistically significant. Thus, in patients with chronic CHF, IS-5-MN produced a greater decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (the major beneficial effect of nitrates in this condition) and a smaller decrease in systemic arterial pressure (the potentially deleterious effects of nitrates). These findings indicate a potential advantage of IS-5-MN over nitroglycerin in patients with CHF, particularly in those with CHF of ischemic etiology.\r"

Eight patients with documented silent ischemia were studied. All patients also had angina on effort treated with calcium antagonists (n = 8) and beta blockers (n = 6). They were evaluated by 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The transdermal nitroglycerin patch, 20 to 30 mg/24 hours, reduced the number of silent ischemic episodes from 9.25 +/- 5.52 to 2.4 +/- 2.0 episodes per 24 hours (p less than 0.001). The maximal ST-segment depression was reduced from 3.1 +/- 0.7 to 0.9 +/- 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001). Ventricular premature beats were significantly reduced, by 50%. Symptomatic ischemic episodes were completely suppressed. Thus, transdermal nitroglycerin, in moderate doses, is effective in suppressing silent ischemia in patients with angina pectoris who have silent ischemic episodes despite treatment with other antianginal agents.\r"

Patients performed treadmill tests 2 and 24 hours after application of patches on the first and last days of each of the 3 treatment periods. Effects caused by sequence of treatments and training with serial testing were prominent so the changes in the well-known parameters did not favor either of the active doses over placebo. Quantification of training effects and its subtraction from performance index disclosed that 10 mg of transdermal NTG caused significant increase in performance in both the acute and sustained stages of therapy in comparison to pretreatment performance. This was not observed with 5 mg and placebo treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to study the efficacy of transdermal NTG with a more objective parameter that permitted elimination of training effects of serial exercise testing.\r"

  ".W": "In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, the antianginal and anti-ischemic effect of a new transdermal system, releasing 10 mg of nitroglycerin (NTG) over 24 hours, was assessed in 19 outpatients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. The trial consisted of a 3-day washout: a 1-week period with verum or placebo patch followed by a second 1-week period with the other patch. During the study only sublingual NTG was allowed, and its consumption and the number of attacks recorded. Treadmill exercise tests were performed at the end of washout before patch application (baseline test) and 3 and 24 hours, respectively, after each period of 7 days of application of 1 patch daily. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate did not vary significantly at rest in the 17 patients who completed the trial. Angina was reduced 31.3% and NTG consumption 34.3% (p less than 0.01) during the week with Deponit 10 as compared with placebo. Exercise duration increased 29 and 16.1% (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.1, respectively) at 3 and 24 hours with a verum patch as compared with placebo. ST-segment depression at comparable loads decreased 69 and 40.5% (p less than 0.01) at 3 and 24 hours, respectively, after application of Deponit. Onset of angina was delayed and maximal heart rate-blood pressure product significantly increased at 3 and 24 hours of treatment. It is concluded that Deponit 10 patch is effective in reducing anginal attacks and in increasing exercise capacity up to 24 hours after application.\r"

NTG patch effects were evaluated by means of a multistage treadmill exercise test. During the acute study, exercise tests were performed after the washout period, after placebo patch (5 hours postdosing) and NTG patch (5, 16, 20 and 24 hours postdosing); a 3-day washout period preceded each test. After 3 months of therapy with the NTG patch, exercise tests were performed in 3-day intervals of continuous therapy 5, 16, 20 and 24 hours after patch application. Then, after 7 days of placebo patch therapy, 1 exercise test was performed 5 hours after application. Statistics were obtained by multivariate analysis of difference. Placebo acute and chronic tests did not show any significant difference when compared. Acute and chronic NTG patch tests, (5 to 24 hours) showed significant improvement of maximal exercise time, the time to onset of 1.0 mm ST-depression and to onset of angina as well as maximal ST depression and ST depression 3 and 6 minutes after exercise testing compared with placebo. These effects were significant over 24 hours after acute or continuous therapy, although all values started to decrease after 16 hours, with a decrease of 10% during the acute and of 15% during the chronic period, compared with values at 5 hours. The efficacy was maintained during 3 months of chronic therapy, even with slightly greater magnitude compared with acute administration, mainly during the time of the first angina and 1.0 mm of ST depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two single-blind placebo-controlled studies were consecutively performed with nitroglycerin (NTG) (5 and 10 mg/24 hours) patches in 24 patients with stable angina pectoris. The relation of NTG patch efficacy with dosage and different subsets of patients during acute and chronic patch therapy was analyzed. NTG patch effects were assessed by multistage treadmill exercise test at 5, 16, 20 and 24 hours after patch application, during single patch administration and after 3 months of continuous therapy, with washout phases as well as with 1- and 7-day placebo patch periods. The analysis of differences between NTG and placebo patch demonstrated significant improvement of exercise capacity in the total group of 24 patients. A taxonomy analysis revealed 2 different subsets in the sample of 24 patients, having similar exercise ST depression but different exercise walking times in the washout period. Group I (15 patients), with an initial 68% of maximal predicted time, showed moderate increases in magnitude of exercise efficacy during the acute and chronic period, with low decrease of effects over 24 hours. Efficacy was greater during the chronic phase, with evident dose relation of all changes. Group II (9 patients), with 40% of maximal predicted time, demonstrated an increased efficacy during acute and chronic therapy, with a steep decrease of all values over 24 hours and significant improvement of exercise tolerance during chronic therapy; these changes were not mainly dose-related. These differences in the magnitude and in the pattern of exercise efficacy over 24 hours, during acute and chronic NTG patch therapy, could probably be attributed to different nitrate mechanisms of action, depending on the pathophysiologic characteristics of stable angina pectoris in 2 subsets of patients. The controversies about NTG patch efficacy have been discussed with regard to relation between multiple modes of nitrate action and the subsets of patients with different prevailing mechanisms of stable angina pectoris.\r"

The assessment was by a randomized double-blind trial involving quantitative coronary angiography and pharmacological stress testing using ergonovine maleate. The peak effect and duration of NTG-induced coronary dilatation were evaluated in 2 groups of 10 patients each, in whom NTG oral spray was given either under resting conditions (group A) or for the release of ergonovine-increased coronary vasomotor tone (group B). The study demonstrates that the 2 different galenic formulations of NTG spray are equally efficacious in dilating the conductance coronary arteries under both conditions. When NTG-h and NTG-I oral spray were given subsequent to ergonovine-testing, the diameters of extramural coronary arteries are not only reset to their dimensions at baseline but furthermore increase above resting values by 15.1% and 15.5%, respectively. Ergonovine-induced coronary vasoconstriction was released significantly for a period of at least 30 minutes. Both the NTG-h and NTG-I oral spray are potent coronary vasodilators in patients with increased coronary vasomotor tone.\r"

Overall, hemodynamic effects of NTG consisted of an increase in stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke work index (+21 and +23%), coupled with a 16% reduction in systemic vascular resistance, and of a marked decrease in right atrial and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures. The hemodynamic end-point (5 to 10% reduction in mean systemic arterial pressure) used for NTG titration was achieved with a significantly lower dose in group B, in which a greater percent reduction in mean PA and mean PA wedge pressures was also observed. However, because effects of NTG on systemic vascular resistance were similar in groups A and B, it was concluded that the vasodilating action of NTG is maintained in advanced age, as opposed to what has been demonstrated for beta-adrenergic agents.\r"

A maximum was reached when this treatment was followed by a 1-h pancreatin digestion. Pepsin digestion products with molecular weight (MW) less than 10,000 solubilized significantly more Fe than those with MW greater than or equal to 10,000. In contrast pancreatin digestion products of MW less than 10,000 were not effective Fe-solubilizing agents.

Additionally, strong positive reactions to polyclonal antisera against adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and human peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) and weaker reactions to antisera against leu-enkephalin and met-enkephalin were observed; all other antisera tested yielded negative results. Positive stainings for vimentin, CLA, alpha 1-AT, alpha 1-ACT, and lysozyme further support the hypothesis that human TMCs may be related to the myeloid-monocytic system. The positive reactivity of TMCs to antisera against ACTH, PHI, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin has not been reported previously. These findings suggest that TMCs are able to store and/or produce regulatory peptides in addition to many other well-known, granule-bound mediators.\r"

  ".W": "An automated method for analytical subcellular fractionation which utilizes routinely available reagents and equipment is described. Tissues are fractionated in Percoll density gradients and marker enzyme analysis of gradient fractions is performed with the Cobas-Bio centrifugal analyzer. Manual assays for cytochrome oxidase and protein were adapted for use with the instrument along with commercially available 5'-nucleotidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and acid phosphatase assay kits. Crude liver homogenate fractions containing different levels of enzyme activity were used to examine the linearity of the enzyme assays. The assays were shown to be linear at high and low levels of activity. Within-run precision studies using high and low activity liver homogenate pools were also performed, and a coefficient of variation of less than or equal to 5.5% was obtained for all assays. This method was used to analyze subcellular fractions from a Percoll density gradient separation of mouse liver homogenate material. The method allowed for a complete marker analysis, consisting of 96 separate kinetic assays, within 2 hours. The versatility of this method and the ease with which it can be performed should expand the use of analytical subcellular fractionation in the diagnostic laboratory.\r"

This report presents a patient with severe hemophilia A, in whom the disappearance of such an inhibitor coincided with the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Laboratory studies demonstrated a marked decrease in helper T-cells and marked depression of cell-mediated immunity by in vivo and in vitro testing. In addition, humoral immune responses were abnormal. Thus, anamnestic antibody formation to different antigens was absent and in vitro pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin synthesis by the patient's B-cells was markedly impaired even in the presence of normal T-cells. These findings indicate that the disappearance of the Factor VIII inhibitor and the lack of an anamnestic antibody response to infused Factor VIII observed in this patient may be secondary to a humoral immunodeficiency associated with AIDS.\r"

A gastric secretory study in which tetragastrin was used as the stimulant revealed that acid and pepsin secretion was less in ALC patients than in hospital controls (p less than 0.001). Endoscopic biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa from ALC patients revealed that atrophy of the gastric mucosa advanced with age. A strong negative correlation was also found between the secretory capacity of the stomach and the degree of atrophy. Possibly, the interval between recurrent episodes of acute mucosal damage was too short to allow complete healing of mucosal lesions. Failure to regenerate denuded epithelium would result in a decrease in the gastric secretory area. Thus, chronic alcohol abuse seems to be an etiological factor in atrophic gastritis.\r"

Its incidence in typhoid fever (67%) was three times higher than in paratyphoid fever (22%). Hepatic dysfunction occurred in 55% of cases. Jaundice was noted in only 8% of the cases, whereas hyperbilirubinemia (serum bilirubin greater than 1.8 mg %) was present in 17%. Although hepatic manifestations of enteric fever were mild, a small but important group had sufficient hepatic involvement to mimick the clinical picture seen in viral hepatitis, amebic liver disease, and malaria with jaundice. It may be considered of clinical significance, since enteric hepatitis responds very well to specific therapy.\r"

Analysis of the distribution of selected polymorphic loci revealed evidence of linkage disequilibrium, particularly between VH2 and VH3 subclass loci, indicating that the subclasses are interdispersed in the human germ-line chromosome. Absolute correlation was detected between alleles of a VH2 locus and the alleles of three VH3 loci, evidence for an extra set of VH genes, which are present in 48% of the Caucasian population. A preliminary estimate of the number of VH genes, approximately 50, indicates a smaller number of VH genes than suggested by the amount of protein variation. The extensive genetic variation we have observed may be associated with genetic differences in the immune response and potentially with variable susceptibility to autoimmune disorders.\r"

There was no significant difference in apo AI or apo AII RFLP allele frequency between groups of individuals with high and low HDL-cholesterol concentration. However, the apo AI PstI RFLP showed an association with genetic variation determining the plasma concentration of apo AI in this sample. Genetic variation in the apo AI-CIII-AIV gene region, as defined by haplotypes, accounted for 16% of the phenotypic variance in the apo AI concentration and for 8% of the phenotypic variance in HDL-cholesterol concentration. There was no significant association between alleles of the apo AII MspI RFLP and genetic variation determining apo AII or HDL concentration.

  ".U": "88161096\r", 
  ".W": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most widely used therapeutic agents for many important rheumatic diseases. A large body of evidence indicates that the anti-inflammatory effects as well as the toxic side effects of NSAIDs can be attributed to their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. The most frequent side effect leading to discontinuation of NSAID therapy is upper gastrointestinal toxicity. This is a major problem for rheumatologists and their patients since alternatives to NSAIDs are not readily available. The mechanism of upper gastrointestinal toxicity associated with NSAIDs can be attributed to their common ability to inhibit gastric PGE2 synthesis, which suggests that gastrointestinal side effects often may not be avoided by substituting another NSAID, a prediction borne out by many patients with rheumatic diseases. However, there is some evidence that some patients may differ in their susceptibility to gastrointestinal and other toxic effects, though this concept has not been rigorously studied in clinical trials. Thus, although changing the specific NSAID may prevent gastrointestinal toxicity in some patients, many are intolerant to all NSAIDs. Patients who benefit from a specific NSAID, but in whom gastrointestinal toxicity develops, have limited options. Another NSAID may be substituted but at the risk of losing therapeutic efficacy and/or of continuing toxicity. Alternatively, the side effects may be controlled while continuing therapy with the NSAID by one of several measures, including the use of antacids or a histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist, such as cimetidine. The use of enteric-coated salicylates or nonacetylated salicylates may also provide satisfactory alternatives. However, patients who have experienced major gastrointestinal toxicity, such as massive bleeding or active peptic ulcers, should usually avoid NSAID therapy.\r"

The present study explores the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Eight subjects unable to excrete ingested free water normally (three patients with SIADH and five healthy humans after intranasal administration of desmopressin) underwent a standard oral water loading test. Plasma ANF level and urinary sodium excretion increased during water retention, whereas plasma aldosterone value decreased later. The increment of urinary sodium excretion rate was significantly correlated with that of plasma ANF. In two patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH, plasma ANF levels were increased during the hyponatremic phase of their condition and decreased under water restriction. In one of them, marked natriuresis was observed when the plasma ANF level was high. It is concluded that secretion of ANF is acutely and chronically stimulated during water retention in SIADH and that ANF may be in part responsible for the natriuresis encountered in inappropriate antidiuresis.\r"

Umbilical cord blood gas determination at the time of delivery showed almost normal values of pH, PcO2, and PO2 in the umbilical vein but acidotic pH with high PCO2 and low PO2 values in the umbilical artery samples. These findings are probably the result of a prolonged umbilical blood circulation time because of fetal cardiac failure. This sluggish perfusion allows the equilibration of fetal blood with maternal intervillous blood, and the findings in the fetal umbilical vein approximate maternal uterine venous values. Umbilical cord acid-base determinations in perinatal surveillance are commonly recommended without specific details. Umbilical artery samples must be obtained to properly assess the metabolic status of the fetus at the time of birth.\r"

To define the effects of ritodrine hydrochloride on these parameters, six pregnant baboons were exposed to both low (1.5 micrograms/kg/min) and high (5 micrograms/kg/min) concentrations of the drug and compared with six control animals not exposed. Ritodrine had no effect on arterial or mixed venous oxygen tension, the arteriovenous oxygen content difference, or the venous-arterial shunt fraction. The treated animals did manifest a significant decline in both arterial (p less than 0.05) and mixed venous carbon dioxide (p less than 0.01) pressures, with associated increases in the respective pH values (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01). Total pulmonary resistance also showed a significant fall during ritodrine treatment (p less than 0.05). These data support a minimal, if any, impact of ritodrine hydrochloride on the blunting of normal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Furthermore, these data are of potential use as a reference in the treatment of pregnant women who have sustained life-threatening insults from exposure to these agents.\r"

Weak Ia-positivity could be identified on the surface of islets cultured with both cytokines for as little as 48 hours; however, the staining appeared most intense after 5 days of culture. Intensely Ia-positive islets were then carefully washed and cultured in media without either cytokine; Ia positivity could be identified on the surface of these islets for up to 1 week.

  ".W": "The plasma and cardiac levels of immunoreactive (IR) atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were measured during the entire lifespan of cardiomyopathic hamsters, which eventually develop spontaneous congestive heart failure, and were correlated with immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and immunocytochemical changes in the secretory apparatus of atrial and ventricular cardiocytes. Plasma IR-ANF rose in the early stages of the disease, reached a maximum in moderate heart failure, and declined thereafter but remained above control values. The peptide decreased constantly in the atria during the evolution of the disease but increased markedly in the ventricles. Its highest levels were found in the inner half of the left ventricle. In atrial cardiocytes, the size and complexity of the Golgi complex increased with the progression of the disease, whereas the number, size, and IR-ANF content (as assessed by the immunogold technique) of secretory granules decreased constantly. In ventricular cardiocytes, the size of the Golgi complex increased, and typical secretory granules were present in approximately 20% of these cells, regardless of their localization in the myocardium. The results suggest that stimulation of ANF secretion in atrial cardiocytes leads to a dissociation between synthesis and release, the latter being maximal according to ultrastructural and immunocytochemical criteria. In ventricular cardiocytes, the same stimulation culminates in increased synthesis and the possibility of release via two pathways: one constitutive, the other regulated. Thus, the elevated plasma levels of IR-ANF in congestive heart failure may be derived from secretion by both atrial and ventricular cardiocytes.\r"

In SAM-R/1, with 125I-HDL purified from both strains. In SAM-R/1, the serum half-life of apo A-II was not altered with increasing age and was practically identical to that of apo A-I. In 2-month old SAM-P/1, the serum half-life of both apo A-I and apo A-II was generally the same as observed in SAM-R/1. However, at age 6 and 12 months, in SAM-P/1, the serum half-life of apo A-II decreased significantly and was less than that of apo A-I. These age-related changes in apo A-II clearance kinetics were observed regardless of the HDL donor. The authors also examined the tissue distribution of injected apo A-II, using 125I-apo A-II reconstituted HDL, and found that several organs trapped more 125I radioactivity in old SAM-P/1 than in young mice. This evidence strongly suggests that age-related changes in the metabolic environment of apo A-II might affect senile amyloidogenesis in SAM-P/1.\r"

The authors have therefore examined the possibility of detecting such rearrangements in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathology specimens. Southern blots of DNA obtained from optimally fixed tissues were very similar to blots of unfixed material, except that the electrophoretic mobility of the fixed DNA fragments was sometimes slightly reduced. High-molecular-weight DNA was not recovered from suboptimally fixed partially autolysed samples. Increasing the time of exposure to formalin resulted in loss of hybridizable DNA. Monoclonal rearrangements of heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes could be detected in formalin-fixed specimens provided that these fixation artifacts were taken into consideration. This technique expands the pool of material available for studies on gene rearrangement and should facilitate the use of such studies in clinical medicine.\r"

During this period, state-only expenditures increased 15-fold, to $156.3 million. Between fiscal 1986-1988, the distribution of state funding for AIDS patient care and support services doubled from 16 to 35 per cent and the number of states supplementing federal funds for testing and counseling increased from eight to 20. Five states continue to account for the largest AIDS appropriations. Of these, California leads in funding research; New York, Florida, and New Jersey have directed funds to provide care and services to IV (intravenous) drug users, prisoners, and children. The average state expenditure per diagnosed AIDS case is $3,323 and an increasing number of states with relatively low case loads are appropriating funds beyond this level. Across states, AIDS expenditures per person average $.65 and $.21 for education, testing and counseling--below the level recommended by the Institute of Medicine for AIDS prevention activities. Some jurisdictions support AIDS activities indirectly by shifting resources, often from their STD (sexually transmitted disease) programs--this trend deserves continuing review given the rise in STD cases and their relationship to diagnosed AIDS.\r"

Total costs, including testing, discarding processed blood, marginal donor recruiting, notifying and evaluating positive donors, are $36,234,000 annually for 10 million donors in 1986. Screening these donors will prevent 292 cases of transfusion-transmitted acquired immune deficiency syndrome (TT-AIDS), saving the costs of therapy and loss of earnings for total benefits of $43,490,480, a benefit:cost ratio of 1.2:1. Net economic benefits of $0.73 per donor will arise from the program. Calculated benefits will rise as increased numbers of infected recipients are diagnosed with longer follow-up or as partially effective therapy increases the cost of caring for patients with AIDS. Changes in test sensitivity, follow-up procedures, estimated value of life, and testing costs will also alter these projections, but none as dramatically as a change in the overall specificity of the screening process. The cost per case of TT-AIDS prevented, $124,089, and cost per year of life extended, $10,885, are comparable to costs of other screening programs.\r"

The 61 patients developed a total of 83 late asthmatic responses, 35 isolated late responses (ILAR), and 48 dual late responses (DLAR), which is a combination of an immediate response (IDLAR) and a late response (LDLAR). Disodium cromoglycate demonstrated significant protective effects on the LAR (P less than .01), however, the LDLAR as part of the DLAR was decreased by DSCG to a slightly higher degree than the ILAR. The BDA also showed significant protective effects on the LAR (P less than .01), but the ILAR was protected by BDA to a slightly higher degree than the LDLAR as part of the DLAR. The immediate asthmatic response as part of the DLAR was prevented by DSCG significantly (P less than .01) while the BDA was ineffective (P greater than .05). It can be concluded that both DSCG and BDA demonstrated significant effects on the LAR. It is suggested that DSCG should be used as a drug of the first choice to control bronchial asthma with an allergy component where the LAR plays a role. The BDA should be added temporarily at the beginning of the treatment of patients in whom the isolated late asthmatic response plays the predominant role, or of patients in whom the DSCG does not provide full control of the LAR during a certain period, eg, during the peak of the pollen season.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Interferon-gamma, a key lymphokine secreted by antigen-triggered T4+ helper cells, is capable of inducing the macrophage to act against a diverse group of microbial targets, in particular, intracellular pathogens. In animal models, treatment with recombinant interferon-gamma is beneficial in systemic intracellular infections, and inhibition of endogenous interferon-gamma activity impairs host resistance. Trials in patients with cancer, leprosy, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have shown that interferon-gamma can activate the mononuclear phagocyte in humans. This research and the identification of patients whose T cells fail to produce interferon-gamma properly has set the stage for evaluating the role of macrophage-activating immunotherapy using interferon-gamma in various human infectious diseases.\r"

The rats received antibiotics for 4 weeks twice daily, and approximately 10 rats in each group were sacrificed for quantitative kidney cultures at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the start of therapy. At the end of the 4- and 6-week periods, significantly better results were obtained with the combination of LY146032 plus gentamicin than with no treatment or treatment with single antibiotics.\r"

The quality of life, degree of renal function, and height attainment of the 31 survivors were assessed in June 1985, when their mean age was 22 years (range 14-27), using hospital records and a questionnaire designed to highlight social and psychological problems. Twenty six patients had a functioning transplanted kidney. Average growth during treatment for all survivors was normal, but most were disappointed with their 'final height'. Though five patients had some form of disabling bone disease, all 31 could walk and 27 could run. Sixteen (67%) were in full or part time employment and nine were living independently. A group of 32 patients with juvenile onset diabetes treated at this hospital for at least five years were also asked to complete the questionnaire and of these, 17 responded. On average, their data could usefully be compared with those of cases of end stage renal failure. More of the diabetics had jobs, but most sexually mature patients with renal disease were concerned about their physical appearance and had not achieved any stable long term sexual relationships. We suggest that a poor body image resulting in low self esteem may be responsible for the deficiency and believe that further study in this group is warranted.\r"

The ventilator differs from 'true' jet ventilators in that its driving gas does not take part in gas exchange. Functionally it is a pressure pre-set, time-cycled ventilator, whose performance is characterised by the rapid and precise maintenance of both inspiratory and expiratory airway opening pressure. All the babies had progressively worsening respiratory failure (mean values of arterial pCO2 were 9.46 kPa, with a pH of 7.14, and an inspired oxygen concentration of 92.5%) on conventional mechanical ventilation. On the new ventilator, with the same settings, there was a dramatic and highly significant improvement within 20 to 30 minutes (mean values of arterial pCO2 were 6.45 kPa, pH 7.26, and inspired oxygen concentration 85.7%). This improvement was maintained. The new ventilator represents an important advance in the management of babies with severe respiratory failure.\r"

In Groups 1 (control) and 2, donors were cooled to 15 degrees C on CPB and organs were either immediately transplanted (Group 1) or stored in saline solution (4 degrees C) for 4 hours (Group 2) prior to transplantation. In Group 3, donors were pretreated with prostaglandin E1 prior to PAF with modified Euro-Collins solution. Organs were stored in saline solution (4 degrees C) for 4 hours and were then transplanted. Acute cardiopulmonary function following transplantation was assessed by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to end-systolic dimension, extravascular lung water (EVLW), lung compliance, arterial oxygenation, and lung biopsy. Cardiac function after the transplantation procedure was similar in all groups, but EVLW values and lung biopsy scores were worse after PAF. Arterial O2 tension appeared lower after PAF, but not significantly so. Core-cooling provides superior static preservation and thus improved graft function in the acute bovine model.\r"

Pepsinogen concentrations were measured by iodine 125-labeled albumin digestion and acid secretion indirectly by carbon 14-tagged aminopyrine uptake. Misoprostol inhibited histamine-stimulated acid secretion in parietal cells with 50% inhibition at 10(-9) mol/L and maximally (78% inhibition) at 10(-7) mol/L. In contrast, however, misoprostol strongly stimulated pepsinogen secretion by gastric glands with a half-maximal effect at 10(-8) mol/L and maximal stimulation of 227% at 10(-6) mol/L. It is possible that this release of pepsin could compromise the action of prostaglandins in promoting ulcer healing.\r"

The observed suppression was not related to altered kinetics, cell death, or interference with the binding of IL-2 to cell surface receptors. It appeared that GST affected an early step in the proliferative process, since maximum inhibition was obtained by the addition of GST within 4 hours of stimulation; progressive reduction of suppression was observed when GST was added later. Significant inhibition occurred when cultured T cells were preincubated for 24 hours with GST and washed prior to IL-2 stimulation, although the degree of suppression was decreased. Thus, inhibitory activity was not dependent on the continued presence of GST throughout culture. These findings suggest that there is a direct inhibition of T lymphocytes by GST, which may be important in immunomodulation by gold compounds.\r"

The positive predictive value for HIV seropositivity was 25%. This study suggests that it is more difficult to define AIDS clinically in children than in adults and that the utility of the proposed WHO clinical case definition for pediatric AIDS for surveillance of children's AIDS in Africa is limited.\r"

Sixteen men who did not progress beyond persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and did not develop HIV antigenaemia showed persistent strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity to all initially recognized HIV proteins. Three out of four men who did not progress beyond PGL but did develop HIV antigenaemia showed declining or absent IgG reactivity to the outer HIV core protein p17, whereas reactivity to other initially recognized HIV proteins persisted in all four; in one of these subjects a striking decline in anti-p17 reactivity occurred 1 1/2 months after HIV antibody seroconversion and 7 1/2 months before HIV antigenaemia developed. In nine out of 10 men who developed constitutional disease [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group IV A] or AIDS (CDC groups IV C1 and IV D), a decline in anti-p17 reactivity was seen preceding or at disease development; in two of these men a concomitant decline in anti-p24 reactivity was seen. In the only individual without HIV antigenaemia who developed CDC group IV disease, anti-p17 reactivity declined 10 months before disease development, whereas no similar decline in anti-p24 reactivity was seen. Decline in IgG antibody reactivity to HIV core protein p17 appears to be an earlier marker of disease progression than the previously reported decline in anti-p24 reactivity, and may be of value in selecting individuals for secondary prevention of HIV-related disease development.\r"

Using the Vironostika plates, HIV antibodies were demonstrated in circulating immune complexes in three and five sera in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Anti-core antibodies hidden in circulating immune complexes were present in three out of eight and two out of nine sera, respectively, in groups 1 and 2, whereas anti-envelope antibodies were present in circulating immune complexes in one out of eight and six out of nine sera in the same groups.

A small number of CEM cells (2%) fluoresced with either AIDS or normal serum. A larger proportion of PBL were immunofluorescent after serum treatment but there was no difference between normal and AIDS serum. We were able to detect ALA in the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with both CEM and PBL. In contrast, incubation of either CEM or PBL with some AIDS sera, and to a lesser degree normal sera, enhanced the binding of intact FITC-rabbit anti-gamma. Anti-gamma was not bound by CEM cells unexposed to human serum. The binding was blocked by rabbit immunoglobulin, demonstrable with CEM fixed in 1% formalin, and unrelated to the density of CD4 on CEM cells.\r"

These insects engorged through a membrane on a blood-virus mixture. Female bedbugs were larger than males and took larger blood-meals when fed to repletion. It was determined that the full blood-meal of a female bedbug contained 0.09 x 10(5) tissue culture infectious doses (TCID) of virus and a male 0.07 x 10(5) TCID, while partial meals taken when feeding was interrupted contained 0.013 x 10(5) TCID and 0.015 x 10(5) TCID for female and male bugs, respectively. Reverse transcriptase activity was assayed after culture of insect extracts in H9 cells: this showed survival of virus in C. lectularius for up to 4 h, in C. hemipterus for up to 1, possibly 2 h, but no survival in Ae. aegypti formosus. Four attempts to transmit the virus by interrupted feeding by C. lectularius from a blood-virus mixture to uninfected blood failed. It is concluded that Ae. aegypti formosus and probably other mosquitoes are not mechanical vectors of HIV and that such transmission is also unlikely to occur in bedbugs under natural conditions.\r"

Poor knowledge of the transmission of AIDS was documented, with 50% of workers stating that AIDS can be spread through ordinary non-sexual contact and 23% through the air by a cough or a sneeze. One-third of employees believed that they should be able to refuse to care for patients with AIDS. Extreme anxiety in dealing with AIDS patients was noted by 25% of employees, and only 16% of the employees would volunteer to work on an AIDS ward. Knowledge regarding AIDS was demonstrated to be a predictor of positive attitudes, appropriate professional behavior and lower anxiety in dealing with AIDS patients. The goal of hospital education programs on AIDS must be to ensure the incorporation of accurate information into the belief system of workers.\r"

Univariate analysis showed an association between HIV seropositivity and a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), blood transfusion, medical injections for treatment of STD, and medical injections for treatment of febrile illnesses. However, injection related to treatment of other conditions were not associated with HIV seropositivity. Among health workers, no association between HIV seropositivity and professional or accidental exposure to HIV-infected patients or to their body fluids was identified. Discriminant analysis showed that HIV seropositivity was associated only with a history of STD and with a history of blood transfusion. In central Africa, a history of STD and a history of blood transfusion should be considered as risk factors for HIV seropositivity. Medical or accidental injections do not seem to play a major role in the transmission of HIV among adults in central Africa.\r"

Two out of 147 (1.4%) adults from a strict rural area, five out of 59 (8.5%) adults from an adjacent market place, and 49 out of 169 (30%) STD clinic attenders from the same area were HIV seropositive. In the first two groups, HIV seropositivity was associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the previous 2 years (P less than 0.001) and with a history of travel to a Rwandese urban centre in the previous 5 years (P less than 0.05). This study suggests that HIV seroprevalence is low in rural central Africa compared with urban centres. Risk factors for HIV seropositivity are similar in rural and urban-based adults in Rwanda, i.e. heterosexual promiscuity and STDs. Many HIV seropositive rural subjects from this study are likely to have acquired HIV infection through sexual contacts in Rwandese cities.\r"

All ELISA-positive sera were also tested by Western blot analysis. In Dar es Salaam HIV antibodies were demonstrated in 3.6% of 192 pregnant women, 5.2% of 784 blood donors, 29.0% of 224 barmaids, 8.0% of 50 male bar workers, 9.25% of 400 male and 12.2% of 90 female patients attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), 85.7% of 35 patients with herpes zoster and in 97.6% of 84 patients clinically suspected of AIDS. Among the barmaids the seropositivity rate was higher in younger women (45%) than in middle-aged women (11%). Only three (4.6%) out of 65 HIV-seropositive barmaids had HIV-related symptoms. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity among healthy low-risk subjects was highest in Bukoba, namely 16% of 100 pregnant women and 13.9% of 36 blood donors, while in Arusha only one (0.7%) of the 144 pregnant women and none of 41 bar workers, none of 42 blood donors and none of 61 patients with STD were positive. In Mbeya, 3.4% of 118 pregnant women and 11.8% of 34 men with STD were seropositive. Thus the prevalence of HIV infection differs considerably in various population groups and in various parts of Tanzania.\r"

In the sexually inactive, whether primary school pupils or residents of old people's homes, no serological evidence of HIV infection was found. In young adults in Kampala the HIV seropositivity ranged from 10.6 to 24.1%, whereas in rural adults the range was from 1.4 to 12.5%. Those with the greatest number of lifetime sexual partners had the highest rate of seropositivity, ranging from 32 to 67.7%. These rates are probably dependent on a number of factors, including sexuality.\r"

Human embryo brain cells displayed glial-cell morphology and expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. Electron microscopy showed clusters of virus particles around these cells as well as budding virus. Extracted, infected glial cells revealed bands for three major gag proteins, p18, p24 and p55, in Western blotting. It was not possible to detect CD4 antigen on the surface of these cells by indirect immunofluorescence or alkaline phosphatase staining with CD4 monoclonal antibodies. The results of these experiments indicate that HIV replicates in non-malignant brain cells. This observation strengthens the postulated aetiological link between HIV and the encephalopathy, dementia and other neurological symptoms observed in HIV-infected patients.\r"

A progression rate to AIDS of 5% per year was seen in those who were infected with HIV. Certain clinical features and routine laboratory investigations were significantly associated with an increased risk of disease progression, but had only limited predictive value. Two hundred and fifty-two serial sera from 57 patients were analysed for the p24 antigen (Abbott), the principal core protein of HIV and antibody against p24 by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients who remained well retained a high titre of anti-p24 antibody compared with those who progressed to AIDS-related complex (ARC) or AIDS. HIV antigen was detectable in 40% of AIDS patients 2 years before diagnosis, but antigenaemia was preceded by loss of anti-p24 antibody by up to 18 months and preceded AIDS by up to 40 months. ARC patients tended to be negative when tested for both alpha-p24 antibody and antigen, suggesting a transitional state. Analysis of the humoral response against gag proteins appears to correlate closely with clinical status and may be an earlier and more consistent way of predicting disease progression than p24 antigenaemia, or clinical and routine laboratory investigations.\r"

  ".W": "During a prospective study of the natural history of AIDS, 1001 homosexual or bisexual men were offered the opportunity to learn their HIV antibody status. Six hundred and seventy (67%) of the population who elected to do so were similar to the 331 (33%) people who declined in a number of baseline characteristics. All were counselled to practice safe sex. To determine whether disclosure of HIV serologic status affects subsequent sexual behavior, we examined changes at four time-points in three sexual activities during the previous 6 months: the number of male partners with whom the participant had (1) sexual intercourse, (2) unprotected anal receptive intercourse, and (3) unprotected anal insertive intercourse. All activities decreased strikingly over the 18-month study period. Following disclosure, the mean number of partners dropped to 47% of the baseline number in people remaining unaware of their antibody status, to 45% in people told that they were seropositive, and to 55% in people told that they were seronegative. The mean number of partners for younger seropositives declined less than that for older seropositives. The mean number of partners with whom unprotected anal receptive intercourse was practiced declined to 57% of baseline in unaware people, 42% in aware seropositives, and 62% in aware seronegatives. The mean number of partners with whom unprotected anal insertive intercourse was practiced declined to 52% of baseline in unaware people, 42% in aware seropositives and 59% in aware seronegatives. Disclosure of a negative test result led to a significantly smaller decline in these sexual activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and sixty-one intravenous (IV) drug users, distributed between a methadone maintenance program and a large detention facility in New York City, were interviewed about knowledge of AIDS, needle use practices, and risk-reduction efforts. Ninety-seven per cent of subjects recognized needle-sharing as an AIDS risk factor; subjects showed less awareness about the effectiveness of certain risk-reduction techniques and tended to over-estimate the risk of casual contact. Of those still sharing needles at the time of first becoming aware of AIDS, 63% reported having subsequently either stopped needle-sharing or ceased IV drug use entirely. Logistic regression analysis indicated that continued needle-sharing behavior was associated with the detention facility site and lower scores on an AIDS knowledge questionnaire; reduced needle-sharing was more evident among methadone program patients and among subjects with greater knowledge about AIDS. The most common reasons for continued needle-sharing among those who continued to share needles despite knowledge of risk were: 'need to inject drugs, with no clean needle available' and 'only share with close friend or relative', offered by 46 and 45% of subjects, respectively. Results suggest that certain subgroups of IV drug users have adopted risk-reduction measures in response to AIDS. Expanded educational programs, increased drug treatment capacity, and additional strategies addressing drug users' access to sterile injection equipment and the social context of needle-sharing may be necessary to curb the further spread of AIDS among IV drug users.\r"

The decrease in viable cells from an established culture was visually observed directly and measured by the loss of cell protein mass as determined by the staining of cultures with naphthol blue-black dye. We avoided confusion with tumor necrosis factor effects by using recombinant human interferon gamma cloned from a single gene as opposed to natural human interferon gamma. Oncolysis induced by recombinant human interferon gamma requires four days after exposure for a significant loss of total cellular protein to be measured, although changes can be observed visually after one day. This sensitivity to recombinant human interferon gamma was observed in SCC cultures obtained from head and neck mucosa, in addition to those from cervix and skin. Several head and neck cultures are sensitive to the oncolytic effect of recombinant human interferon gamma at less than 30 U/mL concentration. The actual time of treatment observations dictates changes in current recombinant human interferon gamma treatment regimens if the oncolytic effect is desired.\r"

  ".W": "Two colour flow cytometry techniques were used to assess the activation stages of peripheral and intraocular T lymphocytes in uveitis. Increased numbers of T lymphocytes bearing the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors were found in intraocular fluids or peripheral blood or both of 35/51 patients with uveitis. This increased expression of IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes correlated with increased expression of other early T lymphocyte activation markers, HLA-DR and L-35. Both T helper cells (Leu-3A+) and suppressor cells (Leu 2A+) were activated in vivo. A positive correlation was seen between lymphocyte activation and clinical uveitis activity. In idiopathic uveitis activation of Leu-3A lymphocytes (helper/inducer) was significantly increased, and intraocular activation of the Leu-2A lymphocytes (cytotoxic/suppressor) was significantly decreased. These data show that some patients with idiopathic uveitis have a perturbation of T helper cells. Twenty-two of 31 patients with idiopathic uveitis, not associated with systemic disease, had increased peripheral T lymphocyte activation. This finding indicates that in some inflammations believed to be restricted to the eye an abnormal systemic immune activation exists.\r"

  ".W": "A new high-energy neutron therapy facility has been installed at the Douglas Cyclotron Centre, Clatterbridge Hospital, Merseyside, in order to extend the clinical trials of fast neutrons initiated by the Medical Research Council. The neutron beam is produced by bombarding a beryllium target with 62 MeV protons. The target is isocentrically mounted with the potential for 360 degrees rotation and has a fully variable collimator. This gives a range of rectilinear field sizes from 5 cm x 5 cm to 30 cm x 30 cm. Basic neutron beam data including output, field flatness, penumbra and depth-dose data have been measured. For a 10 cm x 10 cm field, the 50% depth dose occurs at 16.2 cm in water and the output is 1.63 cGy microA-1 min-1 at the depth of dose maximum. The effectiveness of the target shielding and the neutron-induced radioactivity in the treatment head have also been measured. It is concluded that the equipment meets both the design specifications and also fully satisfies criticisms of earlier neutron therapy equipment. A full radiation survey of the centre was also carried out and it was found that radiation levels are low and present no significant hazard to staff.\r"

The cost is compared with the financial values of the detriment as assessed by the National Radiological Protection Board. The expenditure required to avoid a man-Sv for staff protection in diagnostic departments is suggested. In the examples we take, it is found that the larger staff dose reductions, and often the cheaper reductions, can be obtained by reducing the radiation dose to the patient. There are, of course, major additional advantages to the patient in reducing this dose.\r"

In the present work, data extracted from the original treatment records of a random sample of one in 15 patients have been used to make dose estimates, using Monte Carlo methods, for 30 specific organs or regions of the body and 12 bone marrow sites. Estimates of the mean and median organ doses, standard deviations and ranges have been tabulated. Detailed distributions are presented for six organs (lung, bronchi, stomach, oesophagus, active bone marrow and total body). Comparison with the earlier bone marrow estimates and more recent theoretical estimates shows good agreement.\r"

The assay results reflect the potential value of cytokeratin shedding in urine as a new urinary marker for bladder cancer. A 94% sensitivity for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder suggested the importance of using antibodies prepared against cytokeratin extracted from the same cell type of carcinoma as that to be detected. The relatively low sensitivity shown while detecting transitional cell carcinoma patients and the relatively low degree of assay specificity suggested the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to various types of cytokeratins of bladder carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Three consecutive randomized open studies have been carried out to determine the optimal dosage of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the prevention of postoperative thrombosis in general surgery (892 patients). All patients undergoing abdominal, gynaecological, thoracic or urological surgery were over 40 years old and presented at least one of the following risk factors for thrombosis: previous thromboembolism, obesity, varicose veins, malignancy (30 per cent), pre-operative hospitalization over 5 days, oestrogen therapy, chronic cardiac disease or bronchitis. Isotopic venous thrombosis and bleeding complications were assessed after subcutaneous administration of a LMWH fragment (LMWH, Enoxaparine) or unfractionated heparin (UH). The three studies compared 3 X 5000 units UH daily with 1 X 60 mg, 1 X 40 mg, 1 X 20 mg LMWH daily. Thromboembolic events rates were not significantly different from group to group (UH: 3.8 per cent, 2.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent respectively compared with LMWH: 2.9 per cent, 2.8 per cent, 3.8 per cent). Bleeding episodes including wound haematoma formation, perioperative blood losses and systemic haemorrhage were not significantly different in patients receiving LMWH or UH. Significant decreases in haematocrit and haemoglobin were only observed in patients receiving 60 mg Enoxaparine (as compared to UH). An analysis using the 'intention to treat' approach gave results consistent with those of an analysis of good compliers. An overview of isotopic thromboses in the three studies gave no evidence of differences amongst the effects of the three doses of LMWH (P = 0.20), and pooling the results of the three studies using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure gave no evidence of a global difference between Enoxaparine and UH (P = 0.54). These results suggest that an optimal dosage of 20 mg/day of Enoxaparine is safe and effective in the prevention of postoperative thrombosis in this population.\r"

Seven out of eight patients had a successful percutaneous cholecystolithotomy. An adequate track could not be secured in one man; he had an uneventful cholecystectomy under the same anaesthetic. Follow up at three months of the seven patients showed no calculi and no complications.

In 25 patients who had received diuretics for 2-14 years the mean concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and sodium-potassium pumps were measured in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens and were significantly lower than in those from a group of age matched controls. The reductions in all three variables were significant in those patients receiving diuretics for arterial hypertension as well as in those being treated for congestive heart failure. In 14 patients the mean muscle potassium concentration was below the control range, but only one of those was hypokalaemic (3.4 mmol/l), and 13 were receiving potassium supplements. In 15 patients the mean muscle magnesium concentration was below normal, and the mean muscle potassium and magnesium concentrations showed a linear correlation. In 12 patients in whom the mean muscle potassium concentration was below 80 mumol/g wet weight there was a linear correlation between the cellular potassium:sodium ratio and the concentration of 3H-ouabain binding sites indicating that potassium deficiency also leads to a down regulation of sodium-potassium pumps in human skeletal muscle. In spite of potassium supplements long term treatment with diuretics may lead to potassium and magnesium deficiencies, which are not detectable using the standard methods of serum analysis. The changes in concentrations of electrolytes and sodium-potassium pumps associated with treatment with diuretics may impair muscle function and potassium homoeostasis and interfere with the distribution of digitalis glycosides.\r"

The postoperative complications and mortality in the 175 patients aged 70-79 were compared with those in the 102 patients aged 80 or more. The overall mortality was 11%. Mortality was significantly higher after resection in the older age group even when deaths from widespread malignancy were excluded from the analysis. After curative resection mortality was 2% (2/120) in the younger group and 7% (4/60) in the older group, but after palliative resection of tumours with local or distant spread mortality was significantly higher, at 21% (9/44) and 38% (12/32), respectively. An equal but high proportion of patients in both age groups suffered major complications, but complications caused significantly more deaths in the older group. The length of stay in hospital was not significantly different between the age groups. Patients should not be denied resection of a colorectal cancer because of age alone, especially if a curative operation is possible. The increased risk of death from major complications, particularly after palliative resection, should, however, be taken into account when an operation on patients over 80 is being considered.\r"

The ratio was significantly higher in the Indian patients than in the Europid patients and the Indian controls. There were no significant correlations between the logarithm of the albumin: creatinine ratio and age, known duration of diabetes, haemoglobin A1 concentration, or body mass index within either diabetic group. Hypertension and raised albumin:creatinine ratio were significantly associated, and significant correlations were seen between the logarithm of the albumin:creatinine ratio and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the Indian but not the Europid diabetics. Because of the high prevalence of diabetes at a relatively early age in Indians, nephropathy may emerge as an important clinical problem.\r"

  ".W": "During the six months immediately after a public information campaign about the acquired immune deficiency syndrome 1115 women who attended a genitourinary medicine clinic in west London were tested for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Three women (0.27%) were positive, and all three were regular sexual partners of men with high risk lifestyles--two intravenous drug users and one bisexual. A consecutive series of 647 women from the cohort was tested for antibodies for hepatitis B core antigen: 27 were positive, of whom six had been born in the United Kingdom and were not known to have been at risk. The two women who were seropositive for HIV who completed a questionnaire on their sexual behaviour before they were tested reported both anal and oral receipt of semen and were in the upper fifth percentile for lifetime sexual partners. More than half (53%) of 424 women who reported that they had non-regular sexual partners never used a condom. It is concluded that heterosexual women in London are at a low risk of becoming infected with HIV.\r"

Eating behaviour and psychopathology were assessed by standard methods. At the end of the trial the controls had significantly higher scores than the treated groups on all measures of bulimic behaviour. In terms of behavioural change all three treatments were effective, 71 (77%) of the 92 women having stopped bingeing. In addition, scores on eating and depression questionnaires were reduced and self esteem improved. Follow up was continuing, but of 24 women available at one year, 21 were not bingeing and had maintained their improved scores on psychometric scales. Bulimia nervosa is amenable to treatment by once weekly structured psychotherapy in either individual or group form.\r"

Seven subjects were found to be infected with the virus. Risk factors for transmission included being the regular sexual partner of an abuser of intravenous drugs and having a sexual relationship of more than 18 months' duration. Anal intercourse was not a risk factor in the three subjects who admitted to it. There were 41 regular partnerships with abusers of intravenous drugs in which the antibody state and history were fully known for both partners. In these partnerships male to female transmission of the virus occurred in five out of 34 (15%) and female to male in one out of seven. In 30 couples in whom one partner was known to be positive for HIV and an abuser of intravenous drugs four female partners were found to be seropositive at first testing, but there were no new positive results on subsequent serial testing. In six of these 30 couples both partners abused intravenous drugs but the partner who was negative for HIV remained so. Few of the partnerships always practised safe sexual techniques, even after a partner was known to be positive for HIV. Heterosexual transmission of HIV occurred but was incomplete and may be related to the timing of the relationship with the infection.\r"

Their attitudes to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and infection with HIV are, however, unknown. A questionnaire survey of 196 general practitioners in East Berkshire Health District was used to assess general practitioners' readiness to undertake opportunistic health education to prevent the spread of infection with HIV. Altogether 132 replied. Sixty four of them expressed little interest in health education about HIV, and one in six would not dissent from the notion that AIDS could be controlled only by criminalising homosexuality. Only 75 of them had initiated discussions about HIV with patients. Moreover, many underestimated the risks from heterosexual sex while exaggerating the risks from non-sexual contact. Advice from general practitioners if given extensively might reduce the spread of infection with HIV. How best this may be achieved needs to be considered urgently.\r"

Of the 235 (84%) general practitioners who replied, nine out of 10 were giving advice about infection with HIV to their patients. One in two were testing patients for such infection, and one in four were caring for infected patients. Nevertheless, uncertainty remained about the risks of transmission of infection with HIV and general practitioners' knowledge of educational activities for their patients could be improved. The introduction of a facilitator to work with general practitioners in managing patients with AIDS or infection with HIV is planned, especially to help general practitioners develop the skills needed for prevention.\r"

A postal questionnaire survey was therefore carried out among general practitioners in the North West Thames and East Anglian regions to determine their attitudes to AIDS and the issues it raises for them. One hundred and thirty seven questionnaires were returned (response rate 57%) and four factors underlying the doctors' attitudes identified; these concerned disease control, general practitioner care, patient support, and perception of seriousness. There were wide divergences of attitude among the general practitioners, younger doctors being more in line with specialist thinking on AIDS than older colleagues, and evidence of important gaps between policies advocated by AIDS specialists and bodies of opinion in general practice. Attitudes to AIDS in general practice may partly be a function of personal experience; further study is required.\r"

Replies were received from 181 units. Extrapolating from the survey data showed that about 10,000 patients were transported each year, although many units transferred only a few patients. An appreciable minority of units reported that facilities for secondary transport were inadequate and many were obliged to send inexperienced medical staff with patients. Almost half of the respondents thought that arrangements for transfer were unsatisfactory, but only a tenth said that they delayed or refused transfer for this reason. This undoubtedly reflects a policy of \"making do\" despite inadequate resources. We believe that these results support the concept of regional transport services, where each major unit would be adequately equipped and staffed and unnecessary duplication of resources avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential serum samples from 18 haemophiliac patients exposed simultaneously to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) in early 1984 were tested retrospectively for serological markers of infection. Assay for total antibodies to HIV established that the time to seroconversion might be as long as 110 days after exposure to contaminated factor VIII; serum samples were also tested by Western blotting, by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for specific antibodies to envelope and core proteins, and for p24 antigen by two assay systems during the two years after infection. The studies showed that five of the 12 patients for whom serum samples obtained between exposure and seroconversion were available had transient p24 antigenaemia. Although amounts of total antibody to HIV and of antibodies to envelope proteins rose continuously during the two years of the study, amounts of antibody to the core protein were variable and tended to decline in patients who became symptomatic. Two patients had persistent p24 antigenaemia that began four months after seroconversion; these patients remained asymptomatic. One patient who developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had transient antigenaemia at the time of seroconversion but failed to show any antigen for the rest of the study; progression to AIDS was accompanied by an increase in antibodies to envelope proteins. Much of the variability in the course of infection with HIV must represent the differences in the susceptibility of the patients to infection.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety nine consecutive insulin dependent and 101 non-diabetic pregnant women were examined by ultrasonograph to assess early fetal growth. In 42 of the diabetic mothers and three of the non-diabetic mothers the scan showed early intrauterine growth delay. At 4-5 years of age all children available for study were evaluated by the Denver developmental screening test. Only 23 of the 34 children of diabetic mothers with early intrauterine growth delay had normal test scores compared with 46 of the 50 children of diabetic mothers with normal intrauterine growth. The children failed in personal-social development, gross motor development, and particularly in language and speech development. Children of diabetic mothers with normal early fetal growth had scores very similar to those of the children of non-diabetic mothers, of whom 76 of the 86 tested had normal scores. This study suggests that children with a history of growth delay in early diabetic pregnancy should be screened for possible developmental impairment.\r"

Most of these users (73%) had been taking hypnotic drugs for more than one year, with 25% reporting drug use for more than 10 years. These results suggest that for most elderly users of hypnotic drugs, patterns of consumption encourage the development of cumulative effects and benzodiazepine dependence.\r"

All but five of these patients were over 40 years of age, nearly a third (19) were given a diagnosis related to depression by interviewers, and between a third and a half reported a current physical illness. Long term treatment with benzodiazepines is not necessarily optimum management but may reflect the realities of general practice.\r"

  ".W": "A 10 year study of whooping cough in a discrete general practice community was performed to assess longitudinally the efficacy of pertussis vaccine from one to seven years after immunisation. Of the 436 cases of whooping cough over 10 years, 326 occurred in children aged 1-7 years. The rate of immunisation was known for each cohort of children born during each year, and the attack rate of whooping cough was thus calculated for those immunised and unimmunized. The attack rates were highest in those cohorts exposed to the epidemics of 1977-9, 1981-3, and 1985-7. The efficacy of the vaccine was calculated as a percentage as (attack rate in unimmunized group--attack rate in immunised group) x 100/attack rate in unimmunized group. It fell from 100% in the first year to 46% in the seventh, being 84% in the fourth and only 52% in the fifth. Thus the pertussis vaccine or its schedule of use does not seem to provide sufficient herd immunity to prevent outbreaks of whooping cough. Matters might be improved if vaccination against pertussis were included in the preschool immunisation programme.\r"

Bran increased the stool weight and decreased the transit time in each study in healthy controls and in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, with diverticula, and with chronic constipation. Statistical evaluation of the data showed, however, that constipated patients had lower stool output and slower transit whether or not they had taken bran, and they responded less well to bran treatment than controls. From these data it is concluded that bran can be expected to be only partially effective in restoring normal stool weight and transit time in patients who are constipated.\r"

  ".W": "The beta blocker stroke (\"BEST\") trial was designed to see if the apparent protective effect of propranolol on cerebral function in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage applied also to patients suffering from acute stroke. Three hundred and two conscious patients with clinically diagnosed hemispheric strokes sustained within the past 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive atenolol, propranolol, or matching placebo capsules for three weeks. More early deaths occurred among the patients allocated to receive beta blockers, but this was largely explained by differences in the initial characteristics of the patients among the different treatment groups. By contrast, the outcome in a further 60 patients, who had been taking beta blockers at the time of their stroke but were otherwise similar to the patients in the trial, was considerably better, suggesting that prior treatment with beta blockers might be protective. The search for an effective medical treatment for acute stroke must continue. The approach used here, in which neurological outcome was assessed in a modest number of patients with a view to proceeding subsequently to a full scale trial of functional outcome, allows practical benefits of a treatment to be evaluated under realistic conditions and an ineffective treatment to be eliminated without undue cost.\r"

Activity was detected in all samples (range 3.6-35.0 fmol oestrogen/mg protein/h) but varied considerably not only among different patients but also among the quadrants of individual breasts. The highest activity in a breast was always found in a quadrant that contained tumour, whereas quadrants with the lowest activity were never associated with the presence of tumour. These results provide evidence of a significant relation between breast adipose tissue and breast cancer. Whether such an association occurs because breast tumours are more likely to develop in areas with enhanced oestrogen biosynthesis or because they secrete into their local environment factors capable of stimulating oestrogen biosynthesis remains to be determined.\r"

Seventy two were receiving drugs unrelated to their operation or anaesthesia. One thousand seven hundred and forty six single prescriptions (that is, single doses) were recorded as to be given on the day of surgery and the next day, of which 256 (15%) were not administered. All prescriptions of analgesics and premedicants were given; when these were excluded the proportion of prescriptions that were not given rose to 29%. The prescriptions omitted included 38 out of 95 for drugs for cardiovascular disease, 34 out of 103 for drugs for respiratory disease, and 10 out of 61 for drugs for endocrine disorders. The omission of drugs was not known to the medical staff and may introduce variability in the response of patients perioperatively.\r"

An additional 26 (19%) developed AIDS related conditions. Beta 2 Microglobulin concentration, packed cell volume, HIV p24 antigenaemia, and the proportion and number of T4 lymphocytes each independently predicted progression to AIDS. Beta 2 Microglobulin was the most powerful predictor. The 111 subjects tested who were normal by all predictors (40%) had a three year progression of 7%, and the 68 subjects who were abnormal by two or more predictors (24%) had a progression rate of 57%. Two thirds of all men who progressed to AIDS were in the last group. The median T4 lymphocyte count in subjects who did not progress to AIDS fell from 626 x 10(6) to 327 x 10(6)/l. HIV p24 antigenaemia developed in 7% of the subjects per year. The proportion who were abnormal by two or more predictive variables rose to 41%. At three years an estimated two thirds of the seropositive subjects showed clinical AIDS, an AIDS related condition, or laboratory results that were highly predictive of AIDS. It is concluded from the observed rates and the distribution of predictive variables at three years that half of the men who were seropositive for HIV will develop AIDS by six years after the start of the study, and three quarters will develop AIDS or an AIDS related condition.\r"

Thirty six heroin users had a statistically significantly higher yearly doctor-patient consultation rate than a group of matched controls. More heroin users also failed to attend appointments than controls. When consultations directly related to heroin and its effects were excluded, however, the consultation rates in the two groups were similar. The heroin users did not have an excess of psychiatric disorder or disturbed family background compared with controls but had a noticeable history of dishonest and violent behaviour towards medical staff. A high proportion of heroin users in the study were antibody positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. General practitioners should take advantage of their frequent contacts with heroin users and their families to give them support and counselling about the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

Analysis of the interview data was carried out based on two aspects of student progress: graduation with honours and failure to complete the course of study. The interview as a whole, and especially some of the subscales, appears to identify students who may fail to complete the course: it may also help to predict which students are likely to graduate with honours.\r"

The IA chemotherapy included Adriamycin (n = 14) and mitomycin C plus 5-Fluorouracil (n = 14) were used. The response rate of the primary breast lesions to IA chemotherapy was as high as 83%, and complete necrosis of the tumor was histologically documented in 43% of the cases. The median interval from the initiation of IA chemotherapy to surgery was 7 weeks. Toxicity was acceptable and every patient completed the treatment. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 59% and 53%, respectively. These results suggest that IA chemotherapy is a very useful induction therapy for inflammatory breast cancer in terms of excellent local effects and the short time required for therapy before surgery.\r"

Whether sympathetic-mediated reflex vasoconstriction interferes with nitroglycerin-induced augmentation of coronary blood flow is unknown. Therefore, coronary and systemic hemodynamics were measured in 19 patients during isometric handgrip exercise (3 min x 25% maximal effort), during intracoronary nitroglycerin, and during handgrip plus intracoronary nitroglycerin. Nine patients had no significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis (group 1) and ten patients had greater than 70% left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis (group 2). Handgrip exercise increased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and coronary sinus and great vein flow 15% while increasing coronary resistance 10%. Intracoronary nitroglycerin (200 micrograms) reduced mean arterial pressure -4 +/- 6% and increased great cardiac vein flow 35-72%. Anterior left ventricular regional coronary flow responses to intracoronary nitroglycerin were unaffected by sympathetic stimulation for group 1. Group 2 had a greater increase in great vein flow with intracoronary nitroglycerin plus handgrip compared to nitroglycerin alone due to increased mean arterial pressure with no change in the great vein resistance. These data indicate that sympathetic stimulation does not alter the nitroglycerin-induced augmentation of coronary sinus and great vein blood flow in patients with and without significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. In patients undergoing invasive interventions who may have increased circulating catecholamines, mild sympathetic (isometric) stimulation does not appear to interfere with the coronary vasodilatory responses to intracoronary nitroglycerin.\r"

There is a relative paucity of literature dealing with clinical anaesthetic experience with these patients. We report a retrospective review of the recent experience at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Canada, administering 38 anaesthetics to nine patients with several of the mucopolysaccharidoses; specifically the Hunter, Hurler, Sanfilippo and Morquio syndromes. The establishment and maintenance of an adequate airway represents the most commonly encountered anaesthetic-related problem in these patients.

Induction of myocardial infarction was associated with a transient decrease in blood pressure. CEI treatment maintained a lower blood pressure throughout the experimental period. Plasma renin concentration was not significantly increased in the untreated infarct group (155.4 +/- 136.7 ng AI/ml/hr) as compared to the sham-operated group (47.6 +/- 15.9 ng AI/ml/hr). Plasma aldosterone did not change in the three experimental groups. The plasma level of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor increased in the untreated infarct group (185 +/- 245 pg/ml) as compared with the control group (76 +/- 40 pg/ml) and was normalized by CEI (66 +/- 60 pg/ml). Body weight was slightly decreased in both treated and untreated infarct groups, whereas the heart weight was significantly increased in the untreated group (1,540 +/- 310 mg) and normalized by treatment (1,145 +/- 180 mg) as compared with sham-operated controls (1,071 +/- 80 mg). The combined atria and right ventricular mass was significantly increased in the untreated infarct group (660 +/- 210 mg) and decreased by treatment (443 +/- 106 mg) but was not completely normalized (controls, 343 +/- 40 mg). Left ventricular isomyosin profiles were modified by myocardial infarction as compared with controls: V1 form decreased from 62.4 +/- 9.4% in the sham-operated group to 41.6 +/- 13.4% in the infarct group, and the V3 form increased from 13.0 +/- 4.7% in sham-operated animals to 27.4 +/- 11.8% in untreated infarct animals. CEI treatment partially, but significantly, reversed this modification of the isomyosin profile (V1, 53.0 +/- 14.4%; V3, 17.5 +/- 8.0%). Volume density of collagen was significantly increased in the untreated infarct rats (4.14 +/- 0.81% versus 2.68 +/- 0.49% in controls), and this was reversed by treatment (2.95 +/- 0.66%). Messenger RNA encoding for atrial natriuretic factor, measured by dot blot hybridization, was significantly increased in both the atria and the ventricles in the untreated infarct group, and treatment by CEI partially reversed this increase. Thus, myocardial infarction profoundly modified several variables of peripheral circulation and quantitative and qualitative myocardial protein expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Rat atriopeptin III (APIII) and 3-28 ANF rat (rANF) had negligible effects on basal ICa at concentrations up to 200 nM. However, when ICa was increased by isoprenaline, both peptides had significant inhibitory effects. rANF (3 nM) decreased isoprenaline-elevated ICa by an average of 33% after 3-5 minutes. APIII was slightly less effective than rANF. The effects of rANF and APIII were dose-dependent in a complex manner: one stimulatory and two different inhibitory effects were observed, one being responsible for an irreversible rundown of ICa. The effects of ANF were not blocked by atropine and desensitization of the cells to isoprenaline did not play a significant role in the response to ANF. When ICa was elevated by intracellular perfusion with cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, added to the patch electrode solution or using a perfused pipette, rANF or APIII had less inhibitory effect, and no rundown of ICa was observed. It is proposed that adenylate cyclase may be one of several mechanisms by which ANF regulates ICa.\r"

  ".U": "88165412\r", 
  ".W": "Platelets are suggested to exacerbate ischemia-induced myocardial injury, which has led to the study of various antiplatelet therapies including thromboxane synthetase inhibitors (TXSI). Two such agents, benzylimidazole and OKY-046, reduce infarct size commensurate with a diminution in serum thromboxane B2 formation in anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by 5 hours of reperfusion. In contrast, platelet depletion with specific antiserum does not reduce infarct size but prevents the cardioprotection afforded by the TXSI. Platelet-derived prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGG2 and PGH2), which cannot be converted to thromboxane A2 in the inhibited platelet, can be transformed to PGE2 and PGD2 in plasma and to PGI2 by the blood vessel wall. These prostaglandins are considered \"cardioprotective.\" Consequently, a low dose of aspirin (3-5 mg/kg) given 24 hours before coronary occlusion was used to selectively block the platelet cyclooxygenase enzyme. Aspirin, by itself, does not reduce infarct size, but it suppresses the myocardial salvage induced by OKY-046. Thus, TXSI reduce infarct size by platelet-dependent, aspirin-sensitive mechanism that depends on the redirection of platelet-derived PGG2 and PGH2 to protective metabolites, rather than inhibition of thromboxane A2 per se. Moreover, myocardial salvage induced by the TXSI is accompanied by a reduction in neutrophil accumulation in the myocardium, as indicated by the levels of the neutrophil-specific myeloperoxidase enzyme. Platelet depletion or pretreatment with aspirin prevents the TXSI-induced suppression of neutrophil accumulation. Consequently, it is proposed that the prostaglandin-mediated protective effects of TXSI can be resolved, at least in part, in terms of a braking action on neutrophil activation to prevent leukocyte-dependent tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated as a potential mediator of inflammatory processes. In this study, we quantified the effects of PAF on vessel diameter in a microvascular bed and investigated the biochemical pathways of this compound. The hamster cheek pouch microcirculation was observed with intravital microscopy. Experiments were video-recorded and analyzed with an image shearing device. Vasoconstriction was the predominant vasomotor response to PAF. PAF (10(-10) -10(-5) M) was applied topically to the pouch for 3 minutes. Arterioles ranging in size from 8 to 15 micron were the most sensitive, and they constricted completely in response to PAF 10(-7) and 10(-5) M. Arterioles 21-40 micron in diameter constricted to 12-17% of control after PAF at 10(-7) and 10(-5) M, respectively; they reopened to about 70% of their control value after a few minutes and remained near that size throughout the experiment. Arterioles 41-60 micron in diameter constricted to about 20% control size in response to 10(-7) and 10(-5) M PAF, and by the end of the experiment, these vessels had returned to about 90% control size. To determine the pathways of PAF actions, inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade and receptor blockers were used. Dexamethasone, indomethacin, OKY-046 (a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor), and kadsurenone (a PAF-receptor blocker) blocked the vasoconstrictor response to PAF. Our experiments demonstrate that PAF-produced arteriolar constriction in a microvascular bed is 1) dose-related, 2) dependent upon vessel size, 3) largely due to thromboxane A2 activity, and 4) mediated by PAF-receptor interactions.\r"

The maximal rate of cAMP generation (Vmax) and the concentration of agonist associated with 50% of the maximal activity (apparent Kact) were determined for a series of agents. Six days after infection, the Vmax for isoproterenol significantly declines without a change in the apparent Kact. After 21 days of infection, both the Vmax and apparent Kact for isoproterenol are reduced. At 6 and 21 days of infection, the affinity of the beta-receptor for [125I]iodocyanopindolol declines from 0.84 to 3.6 and 3 nM, respectively, while the receptor density increases with the duration of infection from 33 to 57 and 82 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The Vmax (but not the apparent Kact) for forskolin and Mg2+- and Mn2+-associated activities declines also after 21 days. Another adenylate cyclase activity, which was stimulated by the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p, declines in relation to the duration of infection. Inhibitors of adenylate cyclase activity were also studied. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by adenosine and by Gpp(NH)p (in the presence of forskolin) declines after 21 days of infection. The results suggested that the coupling proteins Ns and Ni, which mediate stimulatory or inhibitory control of receptors to adenylate cyclase activity, might be altered by infection. As monitored by cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation of their respective substrates, which include Ns and Ni proteins, respectively, there are declines in the availability of both substrates as a result of T. cruzi infection. For infected membranes, the addition of NADP enhances the magnitude of cholera toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation and renders the magnitude of pertussis toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation equal to that observed in uninfected membranes. The results support the hypothesis that infection with T. cruzi results in profound generalized alterations of the adenylate cyclase complex at several different sites.\r"

By day 2 in culture, flattened endocardial cells at the wound edge extended processes out onto the wound edge. By 4 and 6 days, the wound was bridged over by spindle-shaped cells although gaps still remained between cells. In some areas, multilayering of cells beneath the surface was present.
