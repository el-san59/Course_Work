  ".W": "Positron emission tomography (PET) was applied to the measurement of myocardial perfusion using the perfusion tracer 13N-labeled ammonia. 13N ammonia was delivered intravenously to 13 healthy volunteers both at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Dynamic PET imaging was obtained in three cross-sectional planes for 10 minutes commencing with each injection. The left ventricle was divided into eight sectors, and a small region of interest was assigned to the left ventricular blood pool to obtain the arterial input function. The net extraction of 13N ammonia was obtained for each sector by dividing the tissue 13N concentration at 10 minutes by the integral of the input function from the time of injection to 10 minutes. With this approach for calculating net extractions, rest and exercise net extractions were not significantly different from each other. To obviate possible overestimation of the true 13N ammonia input function by contamination by 13N-labeled compounds other than 13N ammonia or by spillover from myocardium into blood pool, the net extractions were calculated using only the first 90 seconds of the blood and tissue time-activity curves. This approach for calculating net extractions yielded significant differences between rest and exercise, with an average ratio of exercise to rest of 1.38 +/- 0.34. Nonetheless, the increase was less than predicted from the average 2.7-2.8-fold increase in double product at peak exercise or the 1.7-fold increase in double product at 1 minute after exercise. However, when the first 90 seconds of dynamic data were fit with a two compartment tracer kinetic model, average perfusion rates of 0.75 +/- 0.43 ml/min/g at rest and 1.50 +/- 0.74 ml/min/g with exercise were obtained. This average increase in perfusion of 2.2-fold corresponded to similar average increases in double product. Thus, the noninvasive technique of PET imaging with 13N ammonia shows promise for future applications in determining absolute flows in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with heart failure frequently exhibit abnormal skeletal muscle metabolic responses to exercise, as assessed with 31P NMR. To investigate whether these metabolic abnormalities are due to intrinsic skeletal muscle changes, we performed gastrocnemius muscle biopsies on 22 patients with heart failure (peak VO2, 15.4 +/- 4.7 ml/kg/min; ejection fraction, 20 +/- 7%) and on eight normal subjects. Biopsies were analyzed for fiber type and area, capillarity, citrate synthase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity. All patients with heart failure also underwent 31P NMR studies of their calf muscle during plantarflexion at three workloads. Muscle pH responses and the relation of the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) to systemic VO2 were then evaluated. Compared with normal subjects, patients with heart failure exhibited a shift in fiber distribution with increased percentage of the fast twitch, glycolytic, easily fatigable type IIb fibers (normal subjects, 22.7 +/- 10.1; heart failure, 33.1 +/- 11.1%; p less than 0.05), atrophy of type IIa (normal subjects, 5,477 +/- 1,109; heart failure, 4,239 +/- 1,247 microns 2; p less than 0.05) and type IIb fibers (normal subjects, 5,957 +/- 1,388; heart failure, 4,144 +/- 945 microns 2; p less than 0.01), and decreased activity of beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (normal subjects, 5.17 +/- 1.44; heart failure, 3.67 +/- 1.68 mol/kg protein/hr; p less than 0.05). No significant linear correlation could be identified between the slope of the Pi/PCr to VO2 relation and muscle histochemistry or enzyme activities. Similarly, no linear relation was found between intracellular pH at peak exercise and any muscle variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-three episodes of ventricular fibrillation or flutter (Vf or VF) were provoked by transesophageal asynchronous random shocks occurring during the vulnerable period of the ventricular cycle in seven dogs and seven pigs that were healthy adults. The 43 episodes of Vf or VF were terminated by the transesophageal technique. The defibrillation energy thresholds were 23.11 +/- 6.28 J (range, 5-30 J). Seven episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a cycle length of 360 msec or less (330 +/- 27 msec) were provoked by ventricular pacing stimuli during acute myocardial ischemia resulting from delayed resuscitation in two dogs and three pigs. Five of the seven VTs had a duration of 31 seconds or more, and they were all terminated by transesophageal synchronous shocks, the cardioversion thresholds being 1.71 +/- 2.25 J (range, 0.25-5 J). Fourteen episodes of idioventricular tachycardia (IVT) with a cycle length of 400 msec or more (445 +/- 33.5 msec) spontaneously occurred after the use of adrenaline and after defibrillation in four dogs and five pigs. We also succeeded in terminating seven episodes of IVT with a duration of 34 seconds or more by the same means of treating VT, although IVT is not an indication for cardioversion in the clinical setting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90030817\r", 
  ".W": "The conductance catheter is a promising new instrument for continuously measuring left ventricular (LV) volume. Absolute LV volume (V[t]) is related to uncorrected conductance volume, B(t), according to the equation: V(t) = (1/alpha)(B(t) - alpha Vc). The alpha Vc factor represents parallel-conductance volume due to conducting material outside the LV blood pool, and may be estimated by transiently changing blood conductivity using a bolus injection of hypertonic saline. alpha is the slope in the relation between B(t) and true LV volume. We tested the assumption that alpha Vc and alpha are constant over a range of hemodynamic conditions. We performed multiple hypertonic saline alpha Vc determinations in seven intact dogs during control conditions and subsequent temporary balloon occlusions of inferior vena cava (IVCO), aorta (AO), and pulmonary artery (PAO). We also compared B(t) with simultaneous biplane angiographic LV volume during similar control and intervention conditions. The saline-derived alpha Vc was 76 +/- 2 ml during control and fell significantly by -7 +/- 2 ml during IVCO (p less than 0.001) but not during AO or PAO. According to multiple linear regression analyses, the strongest predictor of saline-derived alpha Vc was uncorrected end-systolic Bes, with a sensitivity coefficient of 0.60 +/- 0.06 ml/ml (p less than 0.001). Angiographically derived alpha Vc showed a similar dependence on Bes, with a coefficient of 0.77 +/- 0.14 ml/ml (p less than 0.001). Angiographically determined alpha also showed significant variation with hemodynamic interventions, largely reflecting an underlying dependence on alpha Vc. The variation in alpha Vc and alpha with LV size may stem from nonlinearity in the B(t)-V(t) relation. Although the conductance catheter provides a useful measure of relative LV volume, measurement of absolute LV volume over a wide hemodynamic range using constant alpha Vc and alpha factors is unrealistic. This result calls into question the current use of this technique for the measurement of the absolute end-systolic--pressure-volume relation.\r"

  ".W": "Three measures of left ventricular (LV) performance derived from pressure (P)-volume (V) loops have been proposed: the end-systolic P-V (PES-VES) relation, the stroke work-end-diastolic V (SW-VED) relation, and maximum dP/dt-VED (dP/dtmax-VED) relation. We evaluated the variability of repeated determinations, and inotropic and load sensitivity of these relations in conscious dogs. LVV was determined from three orthogonal LV diameters measured by sonomicrometry. Three to six sets of variably loaded P-V loops were generated by transient caval occlusions before and again after increasing inotropic state by infusing dobutamine (6 +/- 1 microgram/kg/min, mean +/- SD) and after increasing PES by 49 +/- 17 mm Hg with phenylephrine following autonomic blockade. The slope (MSW) of the SW-VED relation was the least variable at constant inotropic state (coefficient of variation, 4 +/- 3%) compared with the slope (EES) of the PES-VES relation (8 +/- 3%) or the slope (dE/dtmax) of the dP/dtmax-VED relation (11 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05). The extrapolated volume-axis intercept of the SW-VED relation was much less variable than the intercepts of the PES-VES or dP/dtmax-VED relations. MSW, EES, and dE/dtmax all increased (p less than 0.05) in response to dobutamine. The extrapolated volume-axis intercepts of the PES-VES and dP/dtmax-VED relations increased with dobutamine, whereas the volume intercept of the SW-VED relation was unchanged. MSW had the smallest increase in response to dobutamine (124 +/- 22% of control) compared to EES (178 +/- 67% of control) and dE/dtmax (211 +/- 68% of control, p less than 0.05). The position of the PES-VES relation, quantified as the VES at PES = 100 (V100), showed less variability (2 +/- 1%) than the slope of the PES-VES relation (8 +/- 3%, p less than 0.05). V100 decreased from 30.8 +/- 17.4 to 26.7 +/- 13.7 ml during dobutamine (p less than 0.05). After phenylephrine, EES, MSW, and dE/dtmax decreased by less than 10% (p = NS). The PES-VES relation shifted to the left with this increased afterload and V100 decreased by 3.2 +/- 1.5 ml (p less than 0.05), whereas the position of the SW-VED and dp/dtmax-VED relations were relatively unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial salvage after reperfusion may be limited by deleterious vascular changes in the previously ischemic microcirculatory bed. This could result in a progressive decrease in blood flow in the capillary bed to potentially viable myocytes (no-reflow phenomenon). The effect of intracoronary adenosine on these changes was assessed in 15 closed-chest dogs subjected to 2 hours of proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Animals randomly received adenosine (n = 8) 3.75 mg/min into the proximal LAD or an equivalent volume of saline (control) (n = 7) for 1 hour after reperfusion. Endothelial-dependent and independent coronary vasodilator reserve was determined using a chronically implanted volume-flowmeter on the mid-LAD at baseline and 1 and 3 hours after reperfusion with acetylcholine and papaverine infusions, respectively, into the proximal vessel. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured serially with radioactive microspheres and regional contractile function with contrast ventriculography. Both agonists produced a significant increase in LAD flow before occlusion. Endothelial-dependent and independent vasodilatory reserve was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) at 1 and 3 hours after reperfusion in control animals compared with adenosine treatment. A progressive decrease in mid-LAD flow and increase in coronary vascular resistance after reperfusion was observed in control animals (p less than 0.05). The treated group manifested improved regional myocardial blood flow in endocardial regions from the central (0.73 +/- 0.15 versus 0.24 +/- 0.11 ml/g/min; p less than 0.02) and lateral ischemic zones (0.80 +/- 0.15 versus 0.34 +/- 0.12 ml/g/min; p less than 0.05) 3 hours after reperfusion. A significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in endocardial and midmyocardial flow compared with baseline was seen in control animals at 3 hours. Intravascular and interstitial neutrophil infiltration was reduced in adenosine animals and this was associated with relative ultrastructural preservation of endothelial cells. Regional ventricular function in the ischemic zone was improved in the adenosine group 3 hours after reperfusion (13.4 +/- 3.9% versus -5.3 +/- 1.6%; p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that selective administration of adenosine after reperfusion significantly attenuates functional and structural abnormalities in the microvasculature after prolonged (2 hours) regional ischemia in the canine model. Prevention of microvascular injury and the non-reflow phenomenon by adenosine may preserve reversibly injured myocytes following restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".U": "90030820\r", 
  ".W": "Morbidity and mortality from acute coronary artery occlusion may be reduced if local myocardial adenosine concentration is augmented because 1) coronary collateral blood flow during ischemia increases with adenosine infusion, and 2) granulocytes that accumulate in the microcirculation during ischemia are, to a large extent, inhibited by adenosine from generating superoxide anion free radicals, from adhering to vascular endothelium, and from damaging endothelial cells in culture. Using a cultured lymphoblast model system, we found that 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide (AICA) riboside enhanced adenosine accumulation during ATP catabolism. Therefore, AICA riboside pretreatment was used in canine myocardium to selectively increase adenosine concentration in the ischemic area during 1 hour of ischemia. At 5 minutes of ischemia, endocardial flow to ischemic myocardium in saline-treated and AICA riboside-treated dogs was 0.06 +/- 0.03 and 0.34 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g, respectively (p less than 0.01); flow to nonischemic myocardium was not affected. Ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular depolarizations were significantly attenuated in the AICA riboside-treated dogs. Blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by AICA riboside. In venous blood from ischemic tissue, adenosine increased from undetectable levels (less than 0.01 microM) to 0.22 +/- 0.08 microM in saline and 1.79 +/- 0.06 microM in AICA riboside-treated dogs, respectively (p less than 0.001). Coronary vein inosine concentrations were greater in saline than in AICA riboside-treated dogs. In separate in vitro studies, AICA riboside did not alter the removal rate of adenosine from canine blood. Indium-labeled granulocyte accumulation was significantly less in ischemic myocardium in AICA riboside-treated compared with saline-treated dogs. In addition, adenosine, but not AICA riboside, inhibited in vitro canine granulocyte superoxide production. We conclude that AICA riboside given before myocardial ischemia augments adenosine concentration, decreases arrhythmias, decreases granulocyte accumulation, and improves collateral flow to ischemic myocardium. One of the beneficial mechanisms could be an increased production of adenosine rather than inosine from ATP catabolism that causes vasodilation and inhibition of granulocytes. We propose a new hypothesis regarding regulation of the inflammatory reaction to ischemia in the microcirculation. Adenosine, in addition to its vasodilator action, is an anti-injury autacoid that links ATP catabolism to inhibition of granulocyte adherence, microvascular obstruction, and superoxide anion formation.\r"

To examine how ventricular repolarization is modulated by prolonged changes in activation sequence, we studied the effect of ectopic pacing on the distribution of action potential durations (APDs) in nine isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. A contact electrode probe was used to map right and left ventricular-epicardial monophasic action potentials during three consecutive changes in stimulus site, that is, 1) during 45 minutes of right atrial pacing, 2) during 120 minutes of right ventricular pacing, and 3) again, during 60 minutes of right atrial pacing. During each of these phases, the effect of activation sequence on repolarization was examined by linear-regression analysis of APD on activation time (AT). Results averaged for all nine hearts showed that during the initial atrial-pacing phase, APD was inversely related to AT (slope [S] = -1.63; r = 0.76), indicating that sites with earlier activation repolarized later. With the onset of ventricular pacing, the inverse correlation between AT and APD disappeared (S = -0.19; r = 0.31). Continuing ventricular pacing, however, produced slow changes in APD that restored the inverse relation (S = -0.71; r = 0.68 at 120 minutes; p less than 0.0002 versus 5 minutes). Switching from ventricular to atrial pacing again perturbed the inverse correlation (S = 0.28; r = 0.35) but at 60 minutes of atrial pacing, a significant inverse correlation was reestablished (S = -1.25; r = 0.53; p less than 0.01 versus 5 minutes).

Our recent study suggested that APD alternans is determined by the process controlling APD during electrical restitution in P but not in V fibers. In the latter, alternans was attributed to changes in the availability of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. We examined this hypothesis further with the following pharmacologic probes known to alter restitution or action of [Ca2+]i: tetradotoxin (0.5-3.0 microM), lidocaine HCl (2.0-12.0 micrograms/ml), sotalol (10 microM), nicorandil (10-20 microM), 4-amino-pyridine (0.5 microM), ryanodine (10 microM), caffeine (2 mM), and ARL 115 BS (100 microM). Alternans in P fibers persisted under all studied conditions but varied in magnitude depending on the time constant and amplitude of restitution. In V fibers, the magnitude of alternans did not correlate with APD changes during restitution, and APD alternans was associated with the alternans of action potential shape and alternans of developed tension. Alternans in V was suppressed by caffeine at 2.0 mM [Ca2+]o when tension was increased and by ryanodine at 1.0 mM [Ca2+]o when tension was decreased. Alternans in V was not altered by changes in [Ca2+]o within the range of 1.0-4.0 mM; by ARL 115 BS, a compound that increases myofibrillar sensitivity to calcium; or by any other pharmacologic probes. We concluded that in P fibers, APD alternans was determined by the factors controlling APD in the absence of alternans; V fibers posses an independent mechanism of alternans linked to alternans of tension and controlled by [Ca2+]i; in V fibers, alternans could be suppressed by both positive and negative inotropic interventions; and calcium released from sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in the V alternans.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of aerobically perfused rat hearts, the in situ photoactivation (530-590 nm) of rose bengal (a process that leads to the production of singlet oxygen and superoxide) has been shown to lead to the rapid development of electrocardiographic abnormalities and arrhythmias. With rose bengal concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, 100, and 50 nmol/l (n = 6/group), photoactivation (3,600 lx) led to electrocardiographic changes (inversion of the T wave, Q-T prolongation, or both) after 3.8 +/- 0.9, 4.5 +/- 0.7, 11.8 +/- 2.1, 24.8 +/- 3.9, and 65.3 +/- 6.0 seconds), respectively; ventricular premature beats occurred in 100% of hearts after 0.5 +/- 0.2, 1.1 +/- 0.3, 2.2 +/- 0.7, 4.4 +/- 0.8, and 6.6 +/- 1.2 minutes, respectively. Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 83%, 83%, 83%, 67%, and 50% of hearts after 2.1 +/- 0.2, 2.1 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.7, 5.7 +/- 2.0, and 11.2 +/- 1.9 minutes, respectively, and complete atrioventricular block in 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 67% of hearts after 3.8 +/- 0.7, 6.5 +/- 1.0, 5.5 +/- 0.9, 13.8 +/- 1.0, and 14.1 +/- 0.9 minutes, respectively. With a fixed concentration (250 nmol/l) of rose bengal, similar light-response relations were observed. Photoactivation of rose bengal had no effect on heart rate but caused a transient (0-4 minutes) vasodilation followed by a progressive vasoconstriction. In further studies in which rose bengal was washed out for 10 minutes before photoactivation, several arrhythmias still developed, indicating that rose bengal binds strongly to tissue and acts as a cellular level rather than in the vascular compartment. To assess the reversibility of rose bengal-induced effects, hearts (n = 6/group) were perfused with rose bengal (250 nmol/l) for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 20 minutes followed by perfusion in the dark for 19, 18, 16, 14, and 0 minutes, respectively. During dark perfusion, the incidence of arrhythmias declined and any decrease in coronary flow was reversed. However, analysis of contents of adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, lactate, and creatine kinase leakage indicated the occurrence of severe injury that did not abate on termination of photoactivation. Finally, although many arrhythmias developed before the onset of vasoconstriction, the reduction in flow with consequent ischemia was shown to exacerbate vulnerability to arrhythmias. In conclusion, short-lived reactive oxygen intermediates such as singlet oxygen and superoxide, which are produced during the photoactivation of rose bengal, can cause rapid and major damage to the heart and its function.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated, isovolumic rat hearts, perfused by Krebs-Henseleit buffer at constant coronary flow rate, were used to explore the hypothesis that endogenous cardiac glutathione provides protection against myocardial dysfunction associated with short periods of ischemia. Experimental animals were depleted of cardiac glutathione to 35% of control levels by intraperitoneal injections of diethylmaleate (DEM). Left ventricular pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and glutathione levels were measured in control and experimental hearts after 60 minutes of oxygenated perfusion and after 20 minutes of global, no-flow ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. With each protocol, both control and glutathione-depleted hearts received either standard buffer or one supplemented with 2 mM glutathione. Recovery of systolic function after ischemia-reperfusion was impaired in DEM-treated hearts compared with controls. In addition, the rise in perfusion pressure and chamber stiffness was also greater in DEM-treated hearts compared with controls. Recovery in glutathione-depleted hearts was improved when the reperfusate was supplemented with glutathione. In addition, the supplemented reperfusate prevented the decrease in compliance and the increase in coronary perfusion pressure in the glutathione-depleted hearts. Ischemia-reperfusion alone were not associated with a significant alteration in myocardial glutathione levels. Prewashout myocardial levels of glutathione were elevated after reperfusion with glutathione-supplemented buffer but fell to baseline levels after a short washout period. These studies demonstrate that endogenous glutathione is important in protection of myocardium from injury after ischemia-reperfusion, presumably by modifying levels of active oxygen intermediates. The smaller changes in left ventricular pressure and coronary resistance after administration of GSH probably reflects an extracellular mechanism because benefit is seen soon after reperfusion.\r"

  ".U": "90030825\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the relations between coronary perfusion pressure, blood flow, and the diastolic pressure-segment length relation in the conscious animal, circumflex pressure was incrementally decreased in 10 resting, chronically instrumented dogs by a hydraulic occluding cuff while monitoring left ventricular pressure and regional segment length (with piezoelectric crystals) in the circumflex and left anterior descending territories. In five dogs, regional blood flow was measured by microsphere injections at selected circumflex pressures. The diastolic portion of the pressure-segment length curve was unchanged when decrements in circumflex pressure were within the autoregulatory range, that is, unassociated with changes in blood flow or systolic function. Further decrements in circumflex pressure, which decreased blood flow and regional segment shortening (both p less than 0.05), caused a progressive downward and rightward shift of the pressure-segment length curve (p less than 0.05). The rate of relaxation, as measured by tau (the time constant of pressure decay during isovolumic relaxation, which is calculated assuming either a fixed or a variable asymptote) and peak negative dP/dt, decreased slightly during reductions in circumflex pressure within the autoregulatory range and greatly at lower pressure (all p less than 0.05). Thus, in the conscious animal, reductions in coronary perfusion pressure within the autoregulatory range do not affect the diastolic pressure-segment length curve but cause modest decreases in the rate of isovolumic relaxation. Further reductions in coronary perfusion pressure, below the limits of blood flow autoregulation, cause an increased extent of relaxation with a marked downward shift of the diastolic pressure-segment length curve as well as a large decrease in the rate of relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "Cells from the cardiac neural crest are essential for the normal development of both the heart and the great vessels. If cardiac neural crest is ablated surgically from Hamburger-Hamilton stage 9 chicken embryos, they will develop anomalies of both the heart and great vessels that are similar to anomalies that occur in humans. In the absence of cardiac neural crest, another area of neural ectoderm (nodose placode) provides replacement cells that are less competent than those of the neural crest. In this study, both the cardiac neural crest and the nodose placodes have been surgically ablated. A syndrome of unusual prevalence (47%) and severity was found among the survivors of this surgery, which was characterized by a large undivided aorta that arched dorsally without right or left deviation to become the dorsal aorta. There was no other tributary to the formation of the dorsal aorta. There were no ducti arteriosi, and the pulmonary arteries were both ectopic and hypoplastic. The brachiocephalic arteries were asymmetric and hypoplastic. The association of the aorta with the anlagen of the thyroid and thymus glands, as well as with the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve, indicated that the solitary surviving aortic arch artery is that of arch III in this syndrome. These results establish a biological limit of the plasticity of the neural ectoderm and give a probable cellular basis for a lethal congenital septal defect.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate intraoperative changes in myocardial performance during valvular operations, ventricular functional measurements were obtained in 16 patients before and after elective cardiac valvular replacement. Six patients had mitral regurgitation, four had mitral stenosis, and six had calcific aortic stenosis; all patients underwent isolated mitral or aortic valve replacement. Cold potassium crystalloid cardioplegia, topical hypothermia, and low-flow systemic hypothermia were employed uniformly. Just before and 10 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued, left ventricular pressure and volume data were recorded at four to five different steady-state levels of filling produced by blood infusion or withdrawal from the aortic cannula (mean end-diastolic pressure range, 10-22 mm Hg; mean end-diastolic volume range, 120-168 ml). Portable first-pass radionuclide ventriculography and simultaneous micromanometry were used for construction of left ventricular pressure-volume loops from which stroke work and end-diastolic volume were calculated. Two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiograms also were recorded, and epicardial pacing maintained heart rate as constant as possible. As compared with prebypass measurements, echocardiographic left ventricular wall volume changed insignificantly after the valvular procedures (178-181 ml/m2, p greater than 0.5). The stroke work-end-diastolic volume relationship before and after operation was highly linear in all studies (mean = 0.97). The slope and x intercept of this relationship did not change significantly after operation, indicating a stable level of left ventricular function (from 12.7 x 10(4) to 10.0 x 10(4) ergs/ml and from 67 to 57 ml, respectively; p greater than 0.3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates that hypertrophied cardiac tissue is more sensitive to ischemic injury than is normal myocardium. Recent studies indicate that cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury involves the generation of toxic oxygen free radicals. We used the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, with its otherwise genetically identical control (the Wistar-Kyoto [WKY] rat), to investigate the potential role of enzymes that generate and detoxify oxygen radicals in the sensitivity of hypertrophied heart to ischemia and reperfusion. Because hypertension develops progressively with age in SHRs, we assayed xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase at three different time points and found significant fluctuations at different ages. At age 26 weeks, physiological measurements demonstrated hypertension and increased sensitivity to ischemia and reperfusion, measured as significantly decreased left ventricular recovery after injury. At this age, xanthine oxidase, which may generate oxygen radicals, was significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY rats (p = 0.003). Superoxide dismutase, which is a principal step in oxygen-radical detoxification, was significantly lower (p = 0.044). These data suggest that differences in the constitutive levels of oxygen-radical metabolic pathways are different in hypertrophied myocardium, and it is suggested that this finding may play a role in the response of these hearts to ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"

Prior multivariate analyses have failed to identify any strong predictors of this disease. We retrospectively reviewed serial annual coronary angiograms to assess the prevalence of transplant coronary artery disease. A total of 103 patients treated initially with azathioprine-based therapy were compared with a later cohort of 78 patients for whom cyclosporine was the basis of immunosuppressive therapy. The percent of patients free of angiographically visible transplant coronary artery disease at 1 year was 89% for the azathioprine group versus 86% for the cyclosporine group. At 3 years, 74% of the azathioprine group versus 63% of the cyclosporine group were free of visible disease (p = NS). By the fifth postoperative year, 58% of azathioprine-treated and 50% of cyclosporine-treated patients were free of transplant coronary artery disease (p = NS). The mean number of rejection episodes in the first year after transplantation was 2.0 for cyclosporine patients versus 2.5 for azathioprine patients. The azathioprine and cyclosporine patients were compared with respect to a variety of baseline and clinical follow-up measurements that might influence the development of coronary artery disease. Patients in the cyclosporine group had higher blood pressure (135/94 versus 123/85 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and were receiving lower maintenance prednisone doses. This study demonstrates that improved cyclosporine immunosuppression does not decrease the time-related prevalence of transplant coronary artery disease.\r"

Fourteen patients experienced 22 moderate or severe rejection episodes more than 1 year after OHT (LR); 39 were nonrejectors (NR). Twelve of 14 (86%) LR and only 14 of 39 (36%) NR had two or more moderate or severe rejection episodes within the first year after OHT (p less than 0.001). The LR had significantly higher numbers of infections more than 1 year after OHT (2.0 vs. 0.9; p less than 0.05). Nine of 22 (40%) late acute rejection episodes followed within 1 month of infection. Human leukocyte antigen reactivity before OHT, follow-up hemodynamics, length of survival, incidence of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease 1 year after OHT, mean cyclosporine levels, and mean daily prednisone doses were similar in LR and NR patients. We conclude that 1) OHT recipients with two or more moderate or severe rejection episodes in the first year after OHT are at higher risk of developing late acute rejection and may require closer long-term rejection surveillance and more aggressive maintenance immunosuppression and 2) the possible relation between infection and subsequent acute rejection episodes in OHT recipients requires further investigation.\r"

We have followed up 74 cardiac transplant recipients with yearly coronary angiograms. The probability of acute rejection was 10.8% at 1 year. The incidence of coronary artery disease was 8% at 1 year (six of 74 patients) and 24% at 2 years (11 of 30 patients). In patients who developed posttransplant coronary artery disease, there was a slightly higher, but not statistically significant, incidence of acute graft rejection and pretransplant idiopathic cardiomyopathy. No correlation was found between the incidence of coronary artery disease and recipient age, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol level, triglyceride levels, weight gain after transplant, and smoking. These data indicate that triple-drug immunosuppression, despite having produced a significant reduction in the episodes of acute graft rejection, has not decreased the incidence of posttransplant coronary artery disease. Common risk factors for coronary disease and HLA mismatch are probably not important in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis after cardiac transplantation, whereas the risk for coronary artery disease may be increased by acute graft rejection and pretransplant idiopathic cardiomyopathy.\r"

Treadmill exercise duration was similar in the four groups of patients. Resting ejection fraction was also not different among the groups. Exercise ejection fraction did not rise in the group with ischemic times greater than 3 hours, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance.

In an attempt to determine whether lymphocytotoxic antibodies are related to heart allograft survival, we evaluated 123 patients whose sera were monitored for cytotoxic antibodies against HLA antigens after transplantation. Patients underwent serial sampling of peripheral blood at the time of right-heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. Patients with three or more sera containing lymphocytotoxic antibodies were considered alloantibody producers (81 of 123 patients). With similar follow-up, mortality was greater for antibody producers (27 of 81 patients) than for nonproducers (three of 42 patients, p less than 0.01). Among antibody producers, the mortality rate was higher when multiple samples obtained during the first 6 months after transplantation contained anti-HLA class I or class II antibodies. Coronary artery disease was documented in 12 of 81 antibody producers and only one of 42 nonproducers (p = 0.05). The presence of anti-HLA antibodies in the serum showed no association with the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in myocardial biopsies or with hemodynamic abnormalities. However, histologic rejection was present in 14 of 19 antibody producers who died. Thus, the presence of anti-HLA antibodies was associated with increased mortality and the development of coronary artery disease and was a major correlate of the clinical course after cardiac transplantation. High- and low-risk groups can be differentiated within the first 6 months after transplantation.\r"

Because of limited donor heart supply and increasing demand for cardiac transplants, we attempted to expand the donor pool by using hearts from older individuals. This study was designed to determine if older donor hearts adversely affected cardiac transplant patient prognosis by predisposing them to graft failure from coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, or death. Since 1982, 314 heart transplants have been performed at our institutions. Potential donors were deemed fit if there was no history of heart disease, the chest x-ray film was normal, the electrocardiogram showed nonspecific changes only, and blood pressure was maintained without major pharmacological support. In 47 (15%), donor age was 35 years or greater (group 1: mean age, 39 years; range, 35-49 years). In 267 (85%), donor age was less than 35 years (group 2: mean age, 23 years; range, 2-34 years). Mean group 1 recipient age was 55 years (range, 39-68 years) compared with 46 years (range, 0.7-66 years) in group 2 (p less than 0.01). Pretransplant inotropic support, mechanical support, or both were required in 15 (33%) group 1 patients and in 41 (16%) group 2 patients (p less than 0.01).

Overall survival was 64% versus 65%, group 1 versus group 2, and life table analysis showed no significant difference between the groups. There were three of 17 (18%) deaths due to coronary artery disease in group 1 and 20 of 87 (23%) in group 2 (p = NS).

Early postoperative graft function was sufficient in all 72 group 2 patients, whereas in group 1, early graft failure in nine (5.7%) patients led to death or required retransplantation. Forty-one patients in group 2 and 79 patients in group 1 were restudied at annual intervals between 1 and 4 years postoperatively by complete cardiac angiography. Mean late postoperative left and right ventricular ejection fractions were normal in both groups. Graft atherosclerosis was found in seven (8.9%) patients in group 1 and in four (9.8%) patients in group 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although cold blood cardioplegia provides excellent myocardial protection for elective coronary bypass surgery, myocardial metabolic recovery is delayed postoperatively, perhaps because of free-radical injury during reperfusion. To assess free-radical reperfusion injury, we measured the products of lipid peroxidation and the cardiac concentrations of alpha tocopherol in 10 patients undergoing elective surgical revascularization. Arterial and coronary sinus blood measurements revealed a delayed recovery of myocardial oxygen consumption and lactate utilization and the myocardial release of conjugated dienes (chemical signatures of free-radical injury) at 3 and 60 minutes after reperfusion. In addition, myocardial concentrations of alpha tocopherol decreased after reperfusion, suggesting consumption of the major membrane antioxidant. These results support the hypothesis that oxygen-derived free radicals contribute to myocardial injury after cardioplegic arrest and that antioxidant therapy should improve myocardial protection.\r"

Accordingly, we analyzed telemetry data from the initial hospitalization period for 33 cardiac transplant procedures and from 100 hospital readmissions in 23 long-term survivors. Prevalence of arrhythmias was analyzed in relation to immunosuppressive regimen, occurrence of acute rejection, and other clinical and hemodynamic variables. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 55% and 79% of patients during initial hospitalization and in 39% and 43% of long-term survivors, respectively. Compared with cyclosporine-treated patients, atrial (24% vs. 88%, p less than 0.001) and ventricular (65% vs. 94%, p = 0.085) arrhythmias during the initial hospitalization were more prevalent in patients receiving azathioprine. There was no difference in the prevalence of arrhythmias during initial hospitalization between patients experiencing acute rejection and those who did not. Potential associations between arrhythmia occurrence and a prolonged donor heart ischemic time (p = 0.022), elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (p = 0.01), and a lower ejection fraction (p = 0.009) were noted. These data suggest that arrhythmias occur in the majority of patients during the initial hospitalization for transplantation, even in those who never experience acute rejection. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients treated with either immunosuppressive regimen; however, atrial arrhythmias are less prevalent in patients receiving cyclosporine. Arrhythmias tend to occur in the setting of altered hemodynamics.\r"

When patients with subsequent transplantation (n = 16) were compared with those who died on the Jarvik-7 heart (n = 21), there were no significant differences in total artificial heart driving mode such as frequency, ventricular driving pressures, systolic-diastolic ratio, or vacuum use, nor were there any differences in the hemodynamics achieved, such as device output (cardiac output) or atrial filling pressures, throughout the observation. However, improvements of other organ functions, especially kidney and liver, were remarkable in that transplant patients immediately experienced increased urine output and reversal of secondary organ dysfunction. The nontransplant group failed to diurese and continued to deteriorate despite similar hemodynamics. When a smaller model of the Jarvik-7 (volume of 70 ml, n = 18) was compared with the standard model (volume of 100 ml, n = 19), again there were no significant differences except that ventricular stroke volume was consistently less for the 70-ml model. Because of a slightly higher heart rate in the smaller model, device output did not differ between recipients of the two types. The results suggest that once successfully implanted, the Jarvik-7 provides adequate perfusion without associated mortality from circulatory failure, regardless of the size of the ventricle. Recovery from other organ failure appears to be independent of postimplant hemodynamics, a phenomenon that suggests the importance of preimplant status and patient selection.\r"

  ".W": "The Hemopump is a new 7-mm diameter left ventricular assist device that provides as much as 3.5 l/min of nonpulsatile cardiac output after fluoroscopic placement into the left ventricle through a femoral artery cutdown. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of Hemopump assist on hemodynamics, left ventricular function, and perfusion in the presence and absence of ischemia. Eight dogs were instrumented under pentobarbital anesthesia with left ventricular, left atrial, and aortic catheters, a loose silk ligature around the midleft anterior descending coronary artery, and sonomicrometer crystals in midwall myocardium within the left anterior descending and circumflex perfusion territories. Hemodynamic variables, regional systolic fractional shortening, and myocardial perfusion after left atrial injection of 15-microns radiolabeled microspheres were measured in the presence and absence of Hemopump assist before and after left anterior descending artery occlusion. In the absence of ischemia, Hemopump left ventricular assist resulted in reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure while aortic mean pressure was maintained, and there was significant reduction in regional systolic fractional shortening (reflecting systolic unloading) that correlated with an 18% decline in regional myocardial perfusion. During left anterior descending artery occlusion, left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures were reduced during Hemopump assist while aortic mean pressure was maintained. Perfusion rose in the ischemic territory (from 13.0 +/- 8.7% to 26.2 +/- 19.8% of nonischemic flow, p = 0.045). Reduced fractional shortening was again seen in nonischemic tissue with Hemopump assist during left anterior descending artery occlusion, and this was often correlated with reduced perfusion (r = 0.67).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A spherical balloon was inserted into the left ventricle while the usual intra-aortic balloon was introduced into the thoracic aorta. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by direct current. The pumps operating the two balloons were adjusted to inflate the intraventricular balloon during one third of the pumping cycle and the intra-aortic balloon during the next two thirds of the same cycle. The intraventricular balloon capacity varied from 40 to 110 ml (six dogs weighing 16-24 kg) while the intra-aortic balloon capacity was 20 ml. An optimal pumping rate of 75 beats/min maintained an aortic flow of 0.9-1.5 ml/beat/kg and a mean pressure into the brachiocephalic trunk of 110 +/- 12.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). These experimental data indicate that an easily applied mechanical device system (needing no extracorporeal circulation) may be used to bridge the time between intractable cardiac arrest and implantation of an artificial heart or transplantation.\r"

Control levels were from healthy volunteers not undergoing cardiac operation. Preoperatively, numbers of total lymphocytes and subclasses CD3, CD4, and CD8, as well as the interleukin-2 receptors (IL2R), were the same as controls (cells/microliters): lymphocytes, 1,940; CD3, 1,413 +/- 410; CD4, 894 +/- 318; CD8, 490 +/- 185; IL2R, 96.

However, from postoperative day 7 to the last day of ventricular support (group 1, 24-90 days; group 2, 7-29 days), group 1 levels (lymphocytes, 2,364 +/- 618; CD3, 1,825 +/- 553; CD4, 1,013 +/- 187; CD8, 796 +/- 402) were significantly above (p less than 0.01) group 2 levels (lymphocytes, 1,290 +/- 463; CD3, 746 +/- 295; CD4, 534 +/- 253; CD8, 221 +/- 106). These data indicate that lymphocytes and particularly T cells 1) decrease after ventricular assist device insertion, reaching a nadir at postoperative day 2, 2) return to control values after patients whose clinical status improves, and 3) remain low in severely ill patients. T-cell depression in ventricular assist device patients is related to the severity of the patient's condition rather than the presence of the device.\r"

Using technetium Tc 99m-labeled red blood cells, we assessed global and segmental RV function by first-pass and gated blood-pool radionuclide angiocardiography before and within 24 hours after aortic valve replacement in 14 consecutive patients (age, 58 +/- 5 years; mean +/- SEM). Coronary sinus cardioplegia was given in a multidose fashion at a flow rate of 50-70 ml/min through a balloon-tipped catheter, with the inflated balloon kept seated around the intra-atrial rim of the coronary sinus orifice. Additional myocardial protection was provided by systemic (25 degrees C) and topical hypothermia. Postoperatively, none of the patients had clinical or hemodynamic patterns suggestive of RV dysfunction. The postoperative global RV ejection fraction (0.49 +/- 0.03) was similar to the preoperative value (0.49 +/- 0.01). Analysis of segmental wall motion did not reveal postoperative abnormalities of new onset in any of the three anatomically defined RV regions (free wall, apex, and septum). Similarly, RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes (ml/m2) were not significantly affected by coronary sinus cardioplegia, being 71.6 +/- 5.8 and 36.1 +/- 3.5 before, and 67.4 +/- 3.8 and 34.5 +/- 2.3 after aortic valve replacement, respectively. We conclude that retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia does not cause a detectable impairment of RV function if the balloon catheter does not obstruct the terminal tributaries of the coronary sinus and, hence, does not impede delivery of cardioplegia to right-sided cardiac structures.\r"

Thirty patients received the Symbion J7-100, and 70 patients received Symbion J7-70 implants. Eighty-seven patients were men and 13 were women; mean age was 42 years, and mean weight was 73 kg. The time spent on the device ranged from 1 to 243 days, for a mean of 23 days. Sixty-eight patients underwent cardiac transplantation, with a 69% 30-day survival rate and a 46% (31 of 68) long-term survival rate. The majority of the patients had ischemic (52) or idiopathic (36) cardiomyopathies. Indications for implantation of the TAH occurred most frequently in patients whose condition deteriorated while awaiting transplant (34) or who were admitted in acute cardiogenic shock (27). There was an 8.7% incidence of thromboembolic events (four cerebrovascular accidents, five transient ischemic attacks). Multivariant analysis was performed to determine the effect of various factors on the patients' ability to undergo transplantation and then ultimate survival. The results indicate a need for further clinical investigation in patient selection and appropriate timing for implantation of the TAH.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle grafts can be used to mechanically assist the failing heart. In 13 mongrel dogs, latissimus dorsi muscle was preconditioned in situ for 6-8 weeks. Biopsy samples of the muscles were obtained for histochemical analysis. In seven dogs, muscle force and fatigue were compared in conditioned and contralateral unconditioned (controls) muscles. In six dogs, latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty was performed in propranolol-induced acute heart failure, and its effects were evaluated by hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters. Muscle conditioning was responsible for latissimus dorsi transformation to a muscle with predominantly fatigue-resistant type I fibers. Conditioned muscles developed less initial force (-27 +/- 6%) and a longer contraction time (+32 +/- 4%) (p less than 0.05) but did not show fatigue for less than 15 minutes. With synchronous pulse-train stimulation of the muscle flap, cardiac output increased from 1.4 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SD) to 2.0 +/- 0.2 l/min (p less than 0.05), pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 16.3 +/- 0.9 to 12.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 18 +/- 2.0 to 13.5 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Echocardiographically derived ejection fraction increased from 39.3 +/- 2.4% to 59.6 +/- 2.9% (p less than 0.05), and fractional shortening increased from 15.4 +/- 1.1% to 26.3 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.05). Thus, chronic stimulation of skeletal muscles induces fiber transformation and increases resistance to fatigue and force development. Cardiomyoplasty, on the other hand, improves ventricular function in the presence of acute heart failure. This surgical technique represents an alternative method of treatment for advanced myocardial failure.\r"

Seventeen patients, aged 2-62 years, underwent the procedure with three deaths. Hemorrhage precipitated each death, and there was one reexploration for control of bleeding. Postoperative echocardiography showed excellent valvular function. No anticoagulants were used except daily aspirin in three patients who underwent concomitant procedures. There were no thromboembolic episodes. Right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was accomplished with cryopreserved aortic (three) and pulmonary (14) allograft conduits.

Hypothermic global myocardial ischemia was maintained for 90 minutes with intermittent crystalloid cardioplegic solution.

Animals were rewarmed and weaned from bypass. Three experimental groups received either 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg rHSOD. Based on previously reported dose-response data, we conclude that desirable peak serum concentrations are achieved with 16 mg/kg rHSOD. In the setting of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and global myocardial ischemia, single bolus administration of rHSOD before reperfusion is an effective method due to the prolonged serum half-life.\r"

Surgical revascularization was modeled by reopening the LAD with the first cardioplegia reinfusion. The slope of the RSW versus preload relation (a load-independent index of contractility) was decreased by a mean amount of 44% in the LAD region of group 1 hearts but was preserved in group 2 and 3 hearts. The slope of the LCX region was preserved in all groups. The use of adjuvant deferoxamine in this model of early surgical reperfusion eliminates measurable postischemic stunning.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative cardiac patients frequently are mildly hypothermic, yet the influence of hypothermia on left ventricular (LV) contractility has received little attention. To study the possible effects of mild hypothermia on LV function, six pigs were placed on partial right ventricular bypass, the hearts were electrically paced to control heart rate, and myocardial temperature was varied between 34 degrees and 38 degrees C. Using two pairs of orthogonally oriented sonomicrometer crystals in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) distributions, we estimated regional work (the area within LV pressure-area loops) over a range of LV preloads. Diastolic function was assessed by measurement of the time constant of LV pressure decay during isovolumic relaxation. Regional work data were expressed as percentages of baseline (38 degrees C and end-diastolic pressure of 10 mm Hg). To control for preload variations, regional work and time constants were calculated from beats with end-diastolic areas within 0.1% of baseline. Regional work (mean +/- SEM) declined from 85.1 +/- 6.7% at 38 degrees C to 31.9 +/- 4.4% at 34 degrees C. Time constants were prolonged from 44.8 +/- 2.5 msec at 38 degrees C to 61.6 +/- 2.7 msec at 34 degrees C. These data demonstrate a marked depression of LV contractility, even at mild levels of hypothermia that may be encountered clinically after cardiac operations.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the efficacy of laser-assisted reconstructive vascular surgery (LARVS) for patients with severe symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, 118 ischemic legs of 104 patients were retrospectively analyzed (argon:89 and YAG:29 lasers). Of those 118 legs, 26 (22%) had tissue loss, 60 (51%) had rest pain, and 32 (27%) had incapacitating intermittent claudication. The LARVS was adequate in 60 of 118 (51%) and inadequate in 58 of 118 (49%). With argon:89 and Nd:YAG:29 lasers, respectively, 41 of 89 (46%) and 19 of 29 (66%) were adequate. In the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery (PA), the LARVS was adequate in 31 of 43 (72%) in segmental occlusion and in one of 31 (3%) in total-length occlusion (p less than 0.001). In segmental occlusion of the SFA, however, argon:89 and Nd:YAG:29 lasers were adequate in four of 12 (33%) and in 10 of 12 (83%), respectively (p less than 0.05). The legs in which laser was used in more than one artery (eight of eight) or in occluded grafts (proximal SFA to distal PA; three of 18) required amputation within 30 days. A follow-up study demonstrated patency in 31 of 34 (91%) 1-24 months later with the argon:89 laser and in 15 of 16 (94%) 1-6 months later with the Nd:YAG:29 laser. This study indicates that LARVS was adequate in segmental occlusions, particularly in SFA and PA lesions; however, total-length occlusions and combination arterial lesions were not appropriate for the currently available laser systems. Laser application should not be performed if a guidewire passes through the lesion, since these lesions may be more appropriately treated with balloon angioplasty.\r"

Of 900 consecutive elective endarterectomies performed during an 8-year period, 41 patients experienced a perioperative stroke, carotid thrombosis, or both. These patients were subdivided into three groups: group 1, 22 patients with perioperative stroke and carotid thrombosis; group 2, six patients with carotid thrombosis but without symptoms; and group 3, 13 patients with postoperative stroke but no thrombosis. In group 1, 17 patients were reexplored (group 1a), and five were observed without reexploration (group 1b). In group 2, three of the patients were reexplored (group 2a), and the remaining three were observed (group 2b). None of the group 3 patients were reexplored. In group 1a, four (23%) patients awoke from anesthesia with neurological deficits, whereas in group 3, nine (69%) patients awoke with such deficits. Follow-up at 30 days revealed that 76% of group 1a patients demonstrated improvement in symptoms, whereas similar results were seen in only 20% of group 1b patients and 23% of group 3 patients. These trends were maintained throughout the follow-up period of 1-5 years. Those patients who were asymptomatic, group 2, with thrombosis were more likely to have been operated on for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. with thrombosis were more likely to have been operated on for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Thrombosis was the most common cause of postoperative stroke (63%) in patients after carotid endarterectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite success in adults, heart transplantation (HT) is still considered by many as only desperation therapy for children with end-stage heart disease. Thus, of 30 pediatric patients undergoing HT at our center, only seven (23%) patients had not developed pulmonary hypertension with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PH) or hemodynamic decompensation (HD) requiring inotropic support at the time of transplantation. We have retrospectively reviewed the effect of preoperative PH, HD, and seven other potential risk factors on survival of our pediatric heart transplant recipients. All 30 patients, aged 5 days to 18 years, had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Twenty had idiopathic cardiomyopathy, nine had congenital lesions, and one infant had a large left ventricular tumor. A univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis was performed examining the effects of nine variables on survival after transplantation: PH, HD, age, need for hospitalization, congenital heart disease, need for surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction, prior stroke, history of cardiac arrest(s), and mechanical ventilator dependence. One-year actuarial survival for the entire series was 66% and was 100% for the seven patients with neither PH nor HD. None of the nine potential risk factors was a statistically significant predictor of risk, yet the combined presence of PH and HD represented a highly significant predictor of mortality (relative risk, 4.08: 1; p less than 0.002). One-year actuarial survival of the 10 patients with this combination was 30% versus 84% of those without the combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Among 48 consecutive patients with pretransplant pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 4 Wood units, 38 patients underwent orthotopic heart replacement (OHT), and the remaining 10 received a graft in a heterotopic position (HHT). The OHT recipients were smaller (63 vs. 73 kg, p less than 0.05) and received a larger donor heart (donor-recipient, 109% vs. 79%, p less than 0.001) with a shorter graft ischemic time (108 vs. 139 minutes, p less than 0.05) than HHT recipients, reflecting patient selection and surgical complexity. Comparison between the hospital survivors and nonsurvivors identified the selection of HHT and graft ischemic time in excess of 150 minutes as potent risk factors. Immediately after transplantation, pulmonary artery (PA) pressures dropped to almost one half of preoperative values regardless of the mode of transplantation. Within the next 24 hours, however, the OHT group required lower doses of inotropes, had lower left atrial pressure (12 vs. 16 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and were more frequently extubated (58% vs. 10%, p less than 0.01). Catheterization at 10 days revealed a doubled cardiac index and a dramatic reduction in PVR for both groups. The higher the preoperative PVR value, the more substantial the reduction observed, resulting in normalization of PVR for all survivors. The incidence of early graft failure was similar between the groups, but HHT recipients frequently developed pulmonary complications and infection, resulting in a 30% hospital survival in contrast to 71% in OHT recipients (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that transplant candidates with pulmonary hypertension might better be treated by OHT with an oversized, on-site, viable donor heart than by HHT.\r"

Both groups had lignocaine infiltrated into the nasal vestibule and lignocaine applied topically to the nasal mucous membrane. The groups differed in the order in which the medication was given, one group having the infiltration first and the other group the topical application first. Local anaesthesia of the nasal vestibule caused a marked decrease in the nasal sensation of airflow (P less than 0.05) with no accompanying change in nasal resistance to airflow. Topical anaesthesia of the nasal mucous membrane had no effect on either nasal sensation of airflow or nasal resistance. The study demonstrates that the nasal vestibule is the dominant area for sensing nasal airflow. The nasal cavum (the major part of the nasal cavities that is lined by respiratory mucosa) appears to be unimportant as regards the sensation of nasal airflow. The clinical significance of the study is discussed with reference to other work, in this field.\r"

Patients with normal ENGs showed fewer peripheral vestibular lesions and more dizziness of psychogenic aetiology. Almost half the patients with infratentorial lesions had normal ENGs. Patients with rotatory vertigo had fewer ENG abnormalities than those with other types of dizziness. These results suggest that ENG alone is of limited value in the diagnosis of dizziness.

Analysis of age-standardized mortality rates reveals that rates for males have risen significantly during the period 1931-1984 whereas rates for females have declined significantly (P = 0.0001 and 0.005, respectively). The rise in age-standardized mortality rates for males is associated with corresponding significant rates of increase in age-specific rates for males aged 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 + (P less than 0.02) whereas the decline in rates for females is associated with significant declines in rates for women aged 35-44, 45-54, and 75-84 (P less than 0.05).

The extent of the morphological changes bears no obvious relationship either to clinical or familial features. Immunogold studies indicate that there is reduction or loss of the subepithelial portion of the basement membrane, which apparently contains normal amounts of type IV collagen. Unnecessary urological investigations may be avoided by awareness of the condition and microscopic examination of urine for dysmorphic red blood cells. Prospective long-term studies are necessary to determine the nature and consequences of the condition.\r"

  ".W": "The specificity of anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ACPA/ANCA) was investigated in patients suffering from Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), various forms of systemic diseases including vasculitides (non-WG), and different types of biopsy-proven glomerulonephritides. In particular, the diagnostic significance of ACPA/ANCA was assessed in patients affected by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with and without systemic manifestations. From 25 patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis 22 showed the classical diffuse finely granular cytoplasmic staining of neutrophils as did 4/31 patients with idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. One patient with biopsy confirmed Wegener's granulomatosis, six patients with microscopic polyarteritis and 3/31 patients with idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis showed a focal cytoplasmic staining exhibiting a rosette-like pattern. One further patient with Wegener's granulomatosis displayed a prominent fluorescence of the outer nuclear membrane as well as a punctate-diffuse nuclear staining resembling that of granulocyte specific antibodies. Another patient with active Wegener's granulomatosis did not react in the ACPA/ANCA-test. These findings demonstrate different staining patterns of neutrophils which are related to different clinical entities within the spectrum of small vessel vasculitis. Moreover, they point out that different antigens are involved in the various types of vasculitis. In classical cases of Wegener's granulomatosis, but not in other forms of vasculitis, the titer of ACPA/ANCA showed a close relationship to the number of organs involved.\r"

Serum SIRS was detected by its capacity to suppress the induction of plaque forming cells in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated in vitro lymphocyte culture in a dose dependent manner, and specificity was determined by the ability of monoclonal anti-SIRS coated beads to specifically absorb the suppressor activity. Serum SIRS was present in 7 of 18 patients with steroid responsive nephrotic syndrome and in 1 of 6 patients with nephrotic syndrome who were resistant to steroid treatment. It was also found in 2 of 4 patients with nephrotic syndrome which would be expected to be resistant to steroid treatment, in 2 of 10 patients with steroid responsive nephrotic syndrome in remission and in 2 of 8 normal healthy controls but was absent in 8 patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria secondary to a variety of renal disease. It was concluded that, although serum SIRS was present more often in patients with steroid responsive nephrotic syndrome, it is not a sensitive enough assay for predicting the response to treatment.\r"

The purpose of this study was to analyze the consequences of factor D accumulation. A number of in vitro assays were used to analyze AP activation in normal human serum (NHS), in normal serum supplemented with purified factor D to 10-fold its normal concentration (10 x D), and in sera of patients with ESRD. When compared with NHS, in 10 x D: 1) Spontaneous fluid-phase activation of complement at 37 degrees C was greatly increased as measured by C3 cleavage, 2) The lysis of rabbit erythrocytes, a function of the AP, was accelerated, 3) More C3 fragments bound to cuprophane membranes and to immune precipitates; both reactions were accompanied by the formation of more C5a, 4) Complement mediated solubilization of antigen-antibody precipitates was enhanced. Sera of patients with ESRD behaved similarly to 10 x D in all assays used, i.e., enhanced AP function, although complement activation measured in these assays varied widely from one individual to another. Thus, the elevated factor D concentration observed in renal failure might have important pathophysiological consequences, some of which could be detrimental (e.g., C5a produced during hemodialysis), while others might be beneficial, e.g., solubilization of immune precipitates.\r"

  ".W": "Hypogonadism in male hemodialysis patients has been previously reported. However, its precise pathogenesis has not yet been clarified. Mepitiostane and nandrolone decanoate are anabolic steroids prescribed for uremic anemia, and those may possibly exacerbate uremic gonadal damage. We studied the influences of these steroids on male gonadal function. Seventy-six hemodialysis patients were selected and examined for levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, and prolactin. Twenty-three patients who received anabolic steroids showed lower testosterone values (205.2 +/- 35.6 ng/dl) than did patients without these steroids (449.7 +/- 21.3 ng/dl). Gonadotropins and prolactin showed no significant differences between the patients with and without the steroids. The testosterone values of three patients with mepitiostane increased after they stopped taking steroids. One patient suffering from complete aspermia recovered (sperm count: 0/ml to 1300 x 10(4)/ml) after discontinuation of mepitiostane and administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). This clinical study suggests that some anabolic steroids play a role in uremic hypogonadism; thus mepitiostane or its analogues should be carefully prescribed for young male patients.\r"

Usually embolism was manifested as neurologic changes, most often changes of mental status. Death is a potential consequence, and this occurred in one patient. The present authors believe that fat embolism is not predictable preoperatively and propose that intraoperative guidelines can be used to reduce risk of this complication. Intraoperative monitoring by a Swan-Ganz catheter will permit measurement of the pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. A sustained rise of any of these would be an indication to abort the second knee operation. If Swan-Ganz catheter is not available, a sustained fall of oxygen saturation to 90% or lower can be used as a criterion. The risk for fat embolism is increased with the use of intramedullary instrumentation, and the above guidelines are recommended for operations with this type of instrumentation. A fluted intramedullary rod and vent holes should be used.\r"

Fifteen percent of those with a solid fusion had residual pain or even recurrence of infection. Aggressive debridement was successful in eight of ten (80%). Long-term follow-up results show reimplantations were successful in eight of 15 (53%) but were functionally successful in only five of 15 (33%). A treatment plan based on functional considerations follows. For acute infections a very aggressive initial debridement followed by primary closure over an antibiotic-soaked pack is carried out. The prosthesis is left in place if at all possible and if the bone-cement interface has not demonstrated loosening. The knee is debrided every two or three days until negative cultures are obtained. Antibiotic beads are then inserted, with reexploration at three weeks with new cultures. Parenteral antibiotics are given for a three-week period initially. If two successive surgical debridements fail to reveal a positive culture, the knee is closed and rehabilitation is begun. For chronic infections, the recommendations of Wilde and Ruth are followed, employing antibiotic-impregnated beads and spacers with staged debridements similar to the method described above. Finally, an accurate definition of the true value of any of these options is predicated on long-term follow-up studies, since options that seemed promising as an initial procedure have proved disappointing as more experienced and longer follow-up study is obtained.\r"

Thirty-five knees in 33 patients with TKA were followed for a mean duration of 55 weeks. In no case did the surgical procedure include excessive bony resection in order to correct a flexion contracture. Standard goniometric measurements were used to determine the knee flexion contractures preoperatively and postoperatively while the patient was anesthetized and at each successive follow-up visit. All preoperative and postoperative flexion contractures were less than 30 degrees. The mean fixed flexion deformity of the entire group preoperatively was 12.9 degrees; immediately postoperatively, 14.8 degrees; and at final follow-up, 2.9 degrees. No difference was found in the amount of flexion contracture present at final follow-up evaluation with respect to age or gender. The impression that fixed flexion contractures must be corrected at the time of arthroplasty has led to the intraoperative removal of excess bone from the distal femur and/or proximal tibia. The present findings indicate that knee flexion contractures can significantly improve after TKA. There appears to be little, if any indication for excessive removal of bone in an attempt to achieve intraoperative correction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine ideal alignment and component placement of total knee prostheses, Kinematic (K) and total condylar (TC) devices were physiologically loaded and interface forces were measured. Laboratory observations were correlated with clinical (roentgenographic) findings. Asymmetric loading of the tibial component has been proposed as causing loosening and radiolucent lines. Misalignment of components is one factor that affects load sharing by bone under the medial and lateral regions of the tibial plateau. Tibial components of K and TC prostheses were inserted without cement into the cut surfaces of artificial tibiae. The mating femoral condylar components were mounted. The tibial and femoral components were individually positioned at 0 degrees (horizontal) and at certain angles of varus and valgus. Pressure-sensitive film was placed between the tibial component and the artificial tibia. A vertical load of 1500 N was used. The experiment was replicated twice. The percentages of the load on the medial and lateral regions of the tibial plateau were calculated from quantitative image analysis of the pressure patterns on the film. Roentgenograms from 532 K and 21 TC patients were examined to determine the orientations of the condylar and tibial components and the presence of radiolucent lines around the tibial component. An even distribution (ideal alignment) of load on the medial and lateral regions of the K tibial component occurred at 9 degrees of valgus tilt of the femoral component and 2 degrees of varus tilt of the tibial component and for the TC at 7 degrees valgus and 0 degrees varus. Misalignment by 5 degrees yielded a 7% change in the load distribution under the K plateau and a 40% change for the TC prosthesis; a 10 degrees misalignment produced changes of 34% and 62% for the K and TC, respectively. Small variations in clinical knee alignment produced the same percentage of radiolucent lines for each alignment group. The location of radiolucent lines was distributed among the medial, lateral, and both tibial plateaus regardless of knee alignment, although there were more medial reactions overall. The smallest incidence (8%) of radiolucent lines occurred with the K prosthesis at 7 degrees of knee valgus, the femoral component placed at 9 degrees valgus, and the tibial component at 2 degrees varus. This correlated with the ideal bench-test findings for the K device.\r"

There were 12 failures in the total condylar series including three infections (one early and two late), five loose tibial components, two loose femoral and tibial components, and two unstable arthroplasties. The posterior stabilized prosthesis with the polyethylene tibia demonstrated six failures including two loose tibial components, two loose femoral components, and one supracondylar femur fracture. The posterior stabilized prosthesis with the metal-backed tibial component was associated with seven failures including six infections (three early and three late) and one femoral loosening. No metal-backed tibial components have been revised for loosening. The overall failure rate in this series was 1.7% for all prostheses. The incidence of tibial loosening was 0.53% with an average time to failure of 4.7 years. The incidence of femoral loosening was 0.35% with an average time to failure of 2.0 years. Tibial loosening was related to error in technique: postoperative varus tibiofemoral alignment, varus tibial component position, and excessive tibial resection. The overall infection rate was 0.63% for all total knee arthroplasties, and all were secondary to gram-positive organisms. Presently, the posterior stabilized prosthesis with a metal-backed tibia is the authors' implant of choice. Technical error and infection are the major causes of failure.\r"

Both normal and osteoporotic bones were tested. A transverse osteotomy in the subcapital region was fixed by one of two techniques: (1) Asnis screws (AS) or (2) variable length telescoping compression screws (VLCS). Each specimen was roentgenographed after fixation to assess the placement of the devices and reduction. Each femur was held in an angle vise that was placed on rollers on a table mounted on the servohydraulic testing machine. Compression was applied at a constant displacement rate of 10 mm per second to failure. Load and displacement were monitored; specimens were photographed and roentgenographed after failure. In osteoporotic bone, the VLCS provided yield and ultimate load values several times greater than those of the AS. Resistance to combined compression varus loading was significantly higher with the experimental system in osteoporotic bone. In normal bone there was no significant difference between the two systems.\r"

Seven hundred patients treated with total hip arthroplasty were examined preoperatively and several times postoperatively using this technique. Twenty-one abnormal IPG results were obtained, and venography confirmed that 12 of these patients had proximal segment thrombi and five had evidence of calf thrombi. Four venograms were completely clear, demonstrating a false-positive rate of 1.3% (including calf thrombi). Six patients with normal IPG results had calf thrombi. All positive venograms indicating a thrombus in the proximal venous segment were indicated with a positive IPG result, giving a sensitivity of 100%. The standardization of the procedure involving constant leg elevation has assisted in the accuracy of this screening system.\r"

In order to provide quantitative information, three straight and one curved cementless hip stems were submitted to in vitro tests in autopsy specimens of the femur under dynamic axial and torsional loads with the displacements measured in several directions. The results were compared to those of an additional group of cemented straight stem prostheses providing reference values. Subsidence of cementless implants on the average was significantly higher than the cemented reference, but single implants were comparable to the reference. Rotational motion was distinctly higher than the reference values, with considerable differences between designs. When comparing displacements perpendicular to the main load direction, the sagittal plane motion was found to be at least double the motion in the frontal plane. Micromotions at the prosthesis/bone interfaces under the load case selected were smallest for the curved and highest for one of the straight prostheses.\r"

Quantitative bacterial counts were obtained in 52 consecutive open fractures in 50 patients to assess the correlation between quantitative bacterial counts and subsequent sepsis, to determine the effect of time to debridement on the quantitative bacterial count, and finally to review the bacteriology of open fractures. Forty-one of the 52 fractures had positive quantitative bacterial counts. Four of eight (50%) fractures with quantitative bacterial counts greater than 10(5) developed late sepsis, while only two of 44 (5%) with quantitative bacterial counts less than 10(5) or negative quantitative counts became infected. There was no correlation between time to debridement and quantitative bacterial count levels. A significant percentage of the positive quantitative bacterial counts were gram-negative organisms.\r"

Four patients were treated with a titanium segmental defect (SD) prosthesis with good clinical results. A comparative in vitro analysis of fixation with the SD prosthesis, a Rush rod, and a dynamic compression plate (DCP) augmented with methylmethacrylate was performed. The SD prosthesis performed better than the Rush rod and DCP in both the nondestructive four-point bending test and the destructive torsional test. The reconstructed humeri using the SD prosthesis had a torsional strength approaching that of an intact specimen. Hence, the SD prosthesis is a useful adjunct device in treating patients with extensive destructive lesions of the humerus secondary to metastatic disease and hematologic malignancies and in patients with malignant diseases who have had failed attempts at internal fixation.\r"

In this study the holding strength of pin fixation clamps in two representative external fixators (Hoffmann and Orthofix) was evaluated by determination of the torque resistance of pins within a clamp. In the standard Hoffman clamp, the pin-clamping effect was satisfactory in the symmetric two-, three-, and four-pin configurations, whereas the standard Orthofix clamp provided higher holding strength in the symmetric two- and three-pin configurations. All other pin configurations in both clamps resulted in a high variation of pin torsional resistance, and sometimes one of the pins registered low or had no resistance to torsion. The results indicated that the holding power of the clamps was adequate only if certain guidelines were followed at the time of external fixator application. An instrumented torque wrench may be helpful to assess the pin-fastening strength within the clamp. This wrench should also be used to introduce appropriate and uniform tightening torques to the pin clamp screws. However, these results do not apply to those fixators in which each pin will be tightened individually.\r"

In addition, these surgical procedures tend to have less associated patient morbidity by decreasing operative time and minimizing the area of the operative field. The trade-off, however, may be an increased risk of radiation exposure to the surgeon on an annual or lifetime basis. The current study was designed to determine the amount of radiation received by the primary surgeon and the first assistant during selected surgical procedures involving the use of fluoroscopy. Five body sites exposed to radiation were monitored for dosage. The results of this study indicate that with appropriate usage, (1) radiation exposure from fluoroscopy is relatively low; (2) the surgeon's dominant hand receives the most exposure per case; and (3) proper maintenance and calibration of fluoroscopic machines are important factors in reducing exposure risks. Therefore, with proper precautions, the use of fluoroscopy in orthopedic procedures can remain a safe practice.\r"

The disease follows a classic autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The condition is distinct enough in its clinical features and natural history to be recognized as a new and unique disease. There are both general and focal skeletal changes, the latter having a predominantly peripheral distribution and an onset from the second decade. Progressive osteoclastic resorption accompanied by medullary expansion leads to severe and painful disabling deformities with a tendency to pathologic fracture. Most affected members of the family have an associated early-onset deafness and loss of dentition as a result of unique middle ear and dental abnormalities. The serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline are elevated to a variable degree, whereas other biochemical indices are normal. The response of the disease to a therapeutic trial using parenteral dichloro-methylene-diphosphonate (dichloro-MDP) produced an initial rapid biochemical response, which was not sustained.\r"

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the results of total knee arthroplasty in patients under the age of 55 years. Ninety-three knee arthroplasties in 62 patients were performed between 1974 and 1982. The preoperative diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis in 76 knees and osteoarthritis in 17 knees. The total condylar knee prosthesis was used in all knees. Defects in the tibial plateau were noted in 13 knees, and supplemental support was required. Ninety knees (17 with osteoarthritis and 73 with rheumatoid arthritis) were available for follow-up study at a mean of 6.1 years. The knee rating for the entire group was 87.1. The subgroup scores for the osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis groups were also 87.1. Roentgenographic evaluation revealed a lucency rate of 30%. Two implants were found to have global radiolucencies and were considered loose. Survivorship analysis resulted in a cumulative survivorship rate of 96% at ten years for the entire group. These results are comparable to the long-term results of total knee arthroplasty in the older patient and better than the results of total hip arthroplasty in the younger patient. Total knee arthroplasty in the younger patient is a reliable and durable procedure but should be used with caution despite the excellent results reported here.\r"

In 17 adolescent rabbits, a rectangular graft of periosteum was elevated from the medial aspect of each proximal tibia and folded back on itself so that its deep (cambium) layer was facing outward on both sides. The grafts were transplanted into both ipsilateral knee joints that had been paralyzed by section of the femoral and sciatic nerves, and a cast was applied to one hind limb to provide immobilization. The opposite knee joint of each animal was then placed in the continuous passive motion (CPM) apparatus. At the time of death (21 days postoperatively), some degree of neochondrogenesis was evident in 69% of the grafts in the group with casts and in 100% of the grafts in the CPM group. Hyaline cartilage was the predominant tissue in 13% of the grafts in the group with casts compared to 63% of the grafts in the CPM group. Although this investigation has confirmed the chondrogenic potential of free periosteal grafts in a synovial fluid environment (and the significantly stimulating effect of CPM), the results have also demonstrated that at least some hyaline cartilage can be formed by periosteal grafts even with paralysis of the limb plus immobilization of the joint (presumably complete immobilization). Thus, other factors capable of stimulating neochondrogenesis warrant investigation.\r"

  ".W": "A congruent-contact, metal-backed, rotating-bearing patellar prosthesis has been used clinically over an 11-year period. The features of this implant include a congruent-contact, rotating bearing attached to a thin metallic anchoring plate fixed to the bone by cruciate fixturing fins. The device was initially used with methylmethacrylate and later used as a cementless, porous-coated, ingrowth fixation implant. The benefits of congruent contact with mobility to adjust its tracking position during flexion and extension help to eliminate axial shear stresses at the bone-prosthesis interface and lower the contact stresses at the bearing-metal interface to improve wear properties. Prostheses were implanted in 515 knees over a period of six months to 11 years. Of these 515 knees, 331 patellar prostheses have been followed for 24 to 132 months (mean, 73 months). Of that group of 331 implants, 141 were cemented and 190 were cementless. Specific complications involving the use of this implant were as follows. One intraoperative vertical midpatellar fracture in a cemented case went on to uneventful healing with an excellent result. Two displaced postoperative transverse midpatellar fractures (0.39%) occurred in two revision total knee arthroplasties that involved major lateral releases. One of those was a cemented revision and required removal of the implant and a partial patellectomy to gain an excellent result. In the other, a noncemented revision, the patient lacks 45 degrees of quadriceps extension and has a poor result following traumatic fracture at three years postsurgery. One patellar dislocation (0.19%) occurred in a 270-pound, osteoarthritic man in whom undersized components were used. No polyethylene wear-through, separation from the metal anchoring plate, or implant breakage was seen in this series. Overall, the performance of this congruent-contact, metal-backed, rotating-bearing patellar prosthesis indicates the prosthesis can provide long-term function and stability with few short-term or long-term complications.\r"

However, in some cases, the intramedullary guide can be misleading because of unusual femoral bowing and the rotational position of the femur. To determine the effect of rotation, an intramedullary guide was inserted into seven normal adult anatomic specimen femurs that were then examined roentgenographically in known positions of internal and external rotation. A variation of 2.5 degrees was found between the positions of 20 degrees of internal rotation and 20 degrees of external rotation of the femur. Intramedullary instrumentation provides sufficient accuracy when the femur has a normal anatomic shape. However, when an excessive degree of femoral bowing is present, rotational attitudes can affect the roentgenographic measurements, and thus it is prudent to use the intramedullary and extramedullary alignment guides whenever the roentgenogram indicates an unusual angle of femoral resection.\r"

With proper filling of the resultant flexion and extension spaces, instability was corrected in 22 of the knees. Hospital for Special Surgery rating scores at one, two, and three years postsurgery were not statistically different from a matched group of total knee arthroplasty patients without bone grafts. There was no statistical difference in eventual motion or rating scores between those patients with a posterior cruciate-retaining and a posterior stabilized prosthesis. Four bone grafts demonstrated fragmentation and dissolution within the first year with implant subsidence. Needle biopsy performed one year postoperatively in nine knees in which the graft had not fragmented revealed osteocytes in the lacunae in only four grafts. In each of four further knees, there was a complete radiolucency between the graft and the tibial host bone. The overall success rate at five years was only 67%. This high failure rate has led the authors to reevaluate the use of prosthetic shims or wedges in large fragment defects but to continue to use bone grafting for smaller, circumscribed defects.\r"

Attempts can be made to solve the problem with cement, cement with screws, bone grafts, metal wedges, and custom components. In vitro testing has shown that a custom-augmented prosthesis with a built-up metal wedge is mechanically superior in resisting deflections when loaded. Using modular metal wedges, the tibial tray can be customized at the time of surgery. In vitro testing has also shown the wedge to be superior to the use of cement alone or cement reinforced by screws. The authors report on modular metal wedges to augment tibial bone stock deficiency. Twenty-two knees (20 patients) were followed for a minimum of two years with an average follow-up time of 37 months. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years. There have been no failures of this technique and no loosening of tibial components. The incidence of nonprogressive radiolucent lines was 27%. All but one patient was pain-free, and this patient's discomfort was not related to the tibial component fixation. No patient has had subsequent revision surgery. This technique should be considered in the treatment of severe peripheral tibial deficiencies in the elderly, low-demand patient.\r"

  ".W": "Reconstruction of massive proximal tibial defects caused by failed cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was evaluated using cancellous allograft and a rigidly fixed tibial component. Twenty patients with massive tibial defects requiring revision TKA were operated on using this technique from December 1984 to December 1986. All these had tight mediolateral capsular structures so that satisfactory varus-valgus stability was achieved. Only three had competent posterior cruciate ligaments. The tibial component had a cobalt chromium tray with a six-inch-long smooth stem, porous undersurface, and peripheral smooth pegs. Fixation was augmented with four cancellous screws that passed through the periphery of the tray and penetrated the cortical surface of the tibia. Good fixation of the tibial component was achieved in all cases at the time of surgery. All patients achieved full weight bearing within six months, and all but two were free of walking aids at one year postoperation. None of the patients developed apparent loosening of the femoral or tibial components. Two patients complained of mild pain and one who had revision of a painful but nonloosened cemented TKA complained of severe pain. Range of motion was 93 degrees +/- 7.6 degrees. Roentgenographic evaluation showed progressive increase in radiodensity in the grafted areas one year after surgery in all knees. One knee was revised for recurrent dislocation one year postoperation and had a biopsy of the allografted area. This biopsy showed trabeculae with empty lacunae surrounded by viable new bone. Allograft reconstruction of the proximal tibia for failed cemented TKA was highly successful using morselized allograft and rigid fixation of the tibial component.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The underlying pathologic condition was osteoarthritis in nine patients and rheumatoid arthritis in three patients. Nine patients with a postoperative follow-up time of greater than two years (average, 34 months; median, 29 months; longest, 55 months) were evaluated for functional results. Six patients obtained a satisfactory knee fusion in an average of 6.6 months (range, three to 11 months; median, five months). Those patients without massive bone loss preoperatively attained a fusion rate of 66.6%. Two thirds of the patients with massive bone loss attained fusion. Indications for surgery in addition to infection included massive bone loss, mixed infection with multiple organisms, infrapatellar tendon rupture, ligamentous instability, and severe valgus deformity with tibial fracture nonunion. Failure occurred in three cases. One was associated with rod breakage; another was due to massive bone resorption; and the third was in a diabetic female with infrapatellar tendon rupture. All patients with successful arthrodesis reported an absence of pain and the ability to ambulate with, at most, a walker. The use of curved intramedullary rods is a convenient technique for obtaining successful arthrodesis after infected total knee arthroplasty.\r"

However, the long-term benefits have not previously been reported. This study reviews 19 TKAs performed for hemophilic arthropathy that were followed for a minimum of 5.5 years and an average of 9.5 years. At present, 13 knees have good or excellent results, and six knees rate as poor or failures. Those patients with excellent results have maintained good pain relief and function. Four of the six failures were among the first seven arthroplasties performed, when only 80% factor VIII coverage was used during the perioperative period. Since the use of 100% factor VIII coverage was instituted, the failure rate has declined. Ten of the 19 knees suffered complications, including one deep infection, six superficial skin necroses, three nerve palsies, seven postoperative bleedings, and one transfusion reaction. Six of the seven knees operated on under 80% factor VIII coverage had complications. Once 100% factor VIII coverage was instituted, the only complications included one skin necrosis and three postoperative bleedings. The roentgenographic failure rate has remained high with progressive roentgenographic lucencies in 13 of 19 tibial components, associated with component shift in three knees. While these roentgenographic findings have not necessarily correlated with clinical results, they are disturbing and may portend future failures. However, pain relief and improved function are maintained at longer follow-up times. The best results were obtained under 100% factor VIII coverage using a posterior stabilized prosthesis and patellar resurfacing.\r"

Running duration was 3-15 years (mean 8.4 +/- 3.6 yrs). Seven children completed 41 marathons, seven 30-mile races, and eight 60-mile races. The other nine competed at shorter distances. All trained at 30-105 miles/week. Two stress fractures, one back sprain and one knee injury occurred. Athletes who reported injuries from recollection may have underreported some injuries. At age 15.4 +/- 4.2 years bone age was 15.3 +/- 2.6 years and height was at 51 +/- 26.0 percentile. Athletes had larger left ventricular diastolic diameter, higher max O2 uptake, and delayed onset of anaerobic metabolism compared to controls. Psychological profile: IQ = 121 +/- 11, scholastic grade point average (GPA) (n = 13) was less than or equal to 3.0 in four, 3.6-3.9 in four, and 4.0 in five. Cattell 16 personality factor (PF): Seven scored above the 85th percentile on boldness, warmth, conformity, sensitivity, dominance, and high drive with tension. Eight scored above the 93rd percentile for self discipline and emotional stability. Human Figure Drawing showed a distorted body image in seven. Two developed anorexia nervosa, and another girl committed suicide. Thus, high physical fitness and no growth retardation were observed. These runners, however, shared distinct positive and negative personality characteristics. The relatively high incidence of severe psychological disorders possibly suggests a need for psychological screening for young children entering a strenuous training program and for close monitoring for development of psychological problems during the program.\r"

Only 39 parents had heard of PL 94-142, and only 21 of those could define the federal law. Twenty children had an IEP within the previous two years. Possible deficiencies in the implementation of PL 94-142 were discovered. This study demonstrates that the treatment of children with JRA should include efforts to: 1) identify and remediate potential performance limitations before they become problematic at school; 2) communicate this information to parents and school personnel; 3) and improve parents' awareness and understanding of PL 94-142.\r"

To further characterize the cardiac rhythm and conduction of these \"at-risk for SIDS\" infants, we performed 24-hour continuous (Holter) electrocardiograms on 100 full term, healthy infants with ALTE. Sixty-two patients (62%) had one or more dysrhythmias on Holter monitor. Twenty-five patients (25%) had premature ventricular depolarizations (PVD), including five with couplets. Thirty (30%) had QTc greater than 2 SD above the mean, and, of these, 40 percent had PVD's. Fifteen (15%) had premature atrial depolarizations and 39 (39%) had evidence of moderate or marked sinus node irregularity. There was no prexcitation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or atrioventricular block. Two patients with marked sinus node dysfunction were treated with propantheline and did well. All patients were monitored at home, with no deaths or clinically significant dysrhythmias on follow-up (1-32 months (mean = 18]. In summary, when Holter monitoring was performed, a high incidence of dysrhythmia was found in infants with ALTE. Most dysrhythmias were clinically insignificant. The incidence of ventricular dysrhythmias and long QTc are consistent with previously advanced theories of cardiac electrical instability in some of these patients, but no patient with ventricular dysrhythmias required therapy. The incidence of sinus node dysfunction requiring therapy was 2 percent. Although Holter monitoring of infants with ALTE only infrequently determines therapy, it may provide data linking theories of cardiac etiology of SIDS with actual clinical events.\r"

At 07.00, 11.00, 15.00, 19.00 and 23.00 hours on 8 consecutive days in their ordinary environment and under their usual drug regimen, the subjects first rated their dyspnoea with a visual analogue scale and immediately after recorded their PEFR. 3. The linear regression coefficients between dyspnoea score and PEFR for the 35 subjects were continuously distributed between -0.93 and +0.21, with most r values ranging from -0.9 to -0.5. The group median r values calculated at each time point showed that strongest correlation between dyspnoea score and PEFR occurred at 7 h. which coincided with the lowest PEFR values. 4. We chose r = -0.7 (r2 = 0.5) as a limit to distinguish good perceivers (-1 less than r less than or equal to -0.7) from bad perceivers of airway obstruction. These two populations differed only by a higher variability of both PEFR and dyspnoea score in good than in bad perceivers, but not for severity, duration or treatment of asthma, absolute value of dyspnoea score, age or sex. 5. Our study quantified an important intra- and between-subject variability in the accuracy of perception of spontaneous airway obstruction in asthmatic subjects which seems to be unrelated to most characteristics of asthma.\r"

The cooling stimulus was provided by a coverall perfused with water at 16 degrees C. 2. After the application of the cooling stimulus, central body (auditory canal) temperature rose initially in both studies. After underfeeding, the magnitude of this rise in temperature was not significantly different from that seen in the normally fed state. After 48 h starvation, the rise in temperature on cooling was reduced from 0.30 (SEM 0.03) to 0.10 (0.04) degrees C (P less than 0.01). In two subjects in whom central body temperature had been maintained in the normally fed state, a fall occurred after starvation. 3. Underfeeding for 7 days did not affect thermogenesis or the degree of vasoconstriction in the forearm or hand in response to cooling. 4. After 48 h starvation, the thermogenic response to cooling was abolished and blood flow in the forearm remained higher than in the normally fed state. 5. In normal weight young females, thermoregulatory responses to a cooling stimulus were therefore substantially affected by 48 h starvation but not by 7 days underfeeding.\r"

  ".W": "1. It has been suggested that low levels of serum caeruloplasmin in Wilson's disease result from the failure to switch from a fetal to an adult mode of caeruloplasmin gene expression. To investigate postnatal expression of the caeruloplasmin gene, steady-state levels of caeruloplasmin messenger RNA in adult and neonatal rat liver were measured. 2. Copper parameters observed in neonatal rats were similar to those seen in Wilson's disease: hepatic copper concentration was significantly elevated (neonatal 164 +/- 35 micrograms/g, adults 50 +/- 8 micrograms/g, P less than .001) and serum copper and caeruloplasmin levels were low (neonatal 0.5 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml, adults 1.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml, P less than .001; neonatal 0.20 +/- 0.04 arbitrary units, adults 0.69 +/- 0.16 arbitrary units, P less than .001), respectively. 3. Caeruloplasmin messenger RNA levels were analysed by Northern and dot blotting using a 32P-labelled caeruloplasmin complementary DNA probe. A caeruloplasmin messenger RNA of approximately 4.4 kilobases was detected in both adult and neonatal rat liver, with no significant difference observed in steady-state levels. 4. A step subsequent to caeruloplasmin gene transcription must therefore be impaired in neonatal rats.\r"

In order to examine the possibility of heterogeneity in the dependence of renal tubular cells upon oxidative phosphorylation and exogenous substrates, the effects of antimycin A and substrate deprivation on adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) content were examined in isolated rat nephron segments in vitro at 37 degrees C. 2. Antimycin A (5 mumol/l) caused varying decrements in cell ATP level within 5 min in the following order: proximal tubules greater than cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (cTAL) greater than cortical collecting duct (cCD) in the cortex, and thin descending limb of Henle's loop (TDL) greater than medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (mTAL) greater than outer medullary collecting duct (omCD) in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. In the thick ascending limb and the collecting duct, the segments located in the cortex were more sensitive than those in the medulla. 3. Substrate deprivation for 30 min markedly decreased the cell ATP content in cortical and medullary proximal tubules and also in medullary TDL, whereas it caused only a slight decrease in cTAL and mTAL with no change in cCD and omCD. 4. Media made hypertonic by the addition of 200 mmol/l NaCl under aerobic conditions, increased the requirement for exogenous substrates in TDL and mTAL, but not in omCD. This stimulation was seen to a lesser extent in media made hypertonic by the addition of mannitol instead of NaCl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This mast cell population consisted of 79% formalin-sensitive, Alcian Blue-positive mast cells and 21% formalin-insensitive, Alcian Blue-positive mast cells. 3. By the use of centrifugal elutriation and subsequent Percoll gradient centrifugation, separate mixed cell populations could be obtained in which the mast cell constituents were either of the formalin-sensitive or -insensitive type. 4. Cell suspensions in which formalin-sensitive cells comprised 97% of mast cells contained approximately 1.34 pg of histamine per mast cell, whereas in preparations in which mast cells were 84% formalin-resistant the histamine content was approximately 4.17 pg of histamine per mast cell. 5. The histamine release upon anti-immunoglobulin E challenge of formalin-sensitive mast cells was greater than the release by formalin-insensitive mast cells. 6. After challenge with opsonized zymosan, only formalin-sensitive mast cells were able to release histamine. 7. Leukotriene C4 release was observed when formalin-sensitive mast cells were challenged with anti-immunoglobulin E. Formalin-insensitive mast cells showed no release of leukotriene C4. 8.

The relationship between blood pressure and heart rate responses to coughing was investigated in 10 healthy subjects in three body positions and compared with the circulatory responses to commonly used autonomic function tests: forced breathing, standing up and the Valsalva manoeuvre. 2. We observed a concomitant intra-cough increase in supine heart rate and blood pressure and a sustained post-cough elevation of heart rate in the absence of arterial hypotension. These findings indicate that the sustained increase in heart rate in response to coughing is not caused by arterial hypotension and that these heart rate changes are not under arterial baroreflex control. 3. The maximal change in heart rate in response to coughing (28 +/- 8 beats/min) was comparable with the response to forced breathing (29 +/- 9 beats/min, P greater than 0.4), with a reasonable correlation (r = 0.67, P less than 0.05), and smaller than the change in response to standing up (41 +/- 9 beats/min, P less than 0.01) and to the Valsalva manoeuvre (39 +/- 13 beats/min, P less than 0.01). 4. Quantifying the initial heart rate response to coughing offers no advantage in measuring cardiac acceleratory capacity; standing up and the Valsalva manoeuvre are superior to coughing in evaluating arterial baroreflex cardiovascular function.\r"

Lithium clearance was strictly correlated with glomerular filtration rate, and there was no suggestion of distal tubular reabsorption of lithium or influence of osmotic diuresis. 3. Fractional reabsorption of lithium was reduced in most patients with glomerular filtration rates below 25 ml/min. 4. Calculated fractional distal reabsorption of sodium was reduced in most patients with glomerular filtration rates below 50 ml/min. 5. Lithium clearance data were independent of whether renal disease was of primarily glomerular or tubular origin and, further, were not influenced by long-term conventional antihypertensive treatment. 6. It is concluded that, even with a reduced kidney function, the data are compatible with the suggestion that lithium clearance may be a measure of the delivery of sodium and water from the renal proximal tubule. With this assumption it was found that adjustment of the sodium excretion in chronic nephropathy initially takes place in the distal parts of the nephron (loop of Henle, distal tubule and collecting duct). With more severe impairment the proximal tubule also becomes involved in the adjustment.\r"

It has been proposed that the enhanced erythrocyte Na+/Li+ countertransport observed in many patients with essential hypertension could be a marker of abnormal renal proximal tubular function. We thus investigated the relationship of blood pressure and Na+/Li+ countertransport to an index of proximal tubular function such as renal Li+ clearance. 2. The study was carried out in a sample of 299 untreated male subjects (aged 21-59 years) randomly selected from a population at work. Na+/Li+ countertransport was measured in a representative sub-group of 176 men. 3. We did not detect statistically significant correlation of either blood pressure or Na+/Li+ countertransport (Vmax) with fractional excretion of Li+, while confirming the existence of a significant continuous association of blood pressure and body mass index with Na+/Li+ countertransport (P less than 0.01). 4. A sub-sample of 57 participants belonging to the lowest or the highest quintiles of Na+/Li+ countertransport distribution repeated the Li+ clearance study after moderate Na+ restriction. 5. Although fractional excretions of Na+ and Li+ were reduced on the low Na+ diet (both P less than 0.001), they did not differ significantly between groups. 6. Our results are at variance with the findings of a recent case-control study in a young age group and suggest that further studies are necessary before a conclusion can be drawn as to the suitability of Na+/Li+ countertransport as a marker of Na+ reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule.\r"

In patients with hyponatraemia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) we have rapidly corrected hyponatraemia by using urea, without observing clinical CPM. This led us to analyse the brain damage induced by hypertonic saline and by urea when used for the correction of hyponatraemia in a rat model of SIADH. 2. Severe hyponatraemia (serum Na+ less than 115 mmol/l) was produced in 28 rats. Seven rats were excluded from statistical analysis because they died during the correction of hyponatraemia, or because they were under- or over-corrected. Normalization of serum Na+ (135-146 mmol/l) was obtained in 48 h by hypertonic saline (group I, n = 7) or urea (group II, n = 8). 3. Despite similar correction of serum Na+ at 24 h and 48 h, all the rats treated with hypertonic saline presented severe brain damage, whereas those treated with urea were free of any brain damage. A third group of rats (n = 6) who spontaneously corrected their serum sodium level and presented mild hyponatraemia at 48 h (129 +/- 5.2 mmol/l) were also free of any brain damage.\r"

This property may be one factor preventing intracellular acidosis under stress. 4. This method is also suitable for the study of Na+/H+ antiport activity.

Hypoxic ventilatory drive measured using progressive isocapnic hypoxia ranged from -0.13 to -2.65 litres min-1%-1 after placebo and from -0.20 to -6.48 litres min-1%-1 after almitrine. The response was greater after almitrine in six of the seven subjects, and the difference was significant for the whole group (P less than 0.05). 3. Hypoxic ventilatory drive measured using transient hypoxia ranged from -0.19 to -1.59 litres min-1%-1 after placebo and from -0.09 to -1.62 litres min-1%-1 after almitrine. The response was not consistently greater after almitrine, and the difference was not significant for the group. 4. Difficulties in accurately quantifying a brief rise in minute ventilation after transient hypoxia, particularly in subjects with a low hypoxic ventilatory drive, may have masked small changes in the slope of the minute ventilation/arterial oxygen saturation relationship with this method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compliance was confirmed by dietary history and measurement of urinary excretion. 3. Serum albumin was the same on all diets. Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion increased progressively with increasing dietary protein (LPD 6.1 g. NPD 8.2 g. HPD 9.2 g). Recumbent plasma renin activity and serum phosphate were significantly increased on HPD (plasma renin activity: LPD 5.7, NPD 4.6, HPD 8.2 pmol of angiotensin I min-1 1(-1); serum phosphate: LPD 1.27, NPD 1.26, HPD 1.41 mmol/l). 4. There was no evidence of protein-induced hyperfiltration or hyperperfusion: 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetra-acetate and [125I]iodohippurate clearances were similar on all three diets. 5. Since proteinuria, increased plasma renin levels and hyperphosphataemia may contribute to progression of renal failure and because HPD did not improve hypoalbuminaemia, the use of HPD in the nephrotic syndrome should be abandoned. 6. Until it can be established that LPD, which is accompanied by the least proteinuria, does not, with long-term feeding, lead to malnutrition, NPD should be used in the treatment of the nephrotic syndrome.\r"

No positive patch tests were seen in the controls. Parthenium hysterophorus (78%) was the most frequent plant reacting, followed by Chrysanthemum morifolium (42%), Dahlia pinnata (18%) and Tagetes indica (7%).\r"

  ".W": "The influence of eccrine sweating on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was investigated. TEWL was simultaneously measured on both forearms, with and without topical inactivation of the eccrine sweat glands by 0.3 ml of 0.5% aqueous scopolamine hydrobromide (HBr), applied under 1 h occlusive patches. The degree of sweat inhibition, after exercise, was measured at 2, 3 and 4 h after patch removal. In 42 out of 44 subjects, complete sweat inhibition (on exercise) was achieved only at 4 h after removal. After a 15-min rest in a room at 20 degrees C, the pre-exercise TEWL values (at 4 h) on the treated and untreated sites were not different (P greater than 0.05), in 38 out of 44 subjects. By this rest period, sweating due to slight physical, thermal or even emotional stimuli may be prevented in most subjects. In the other 6 subjects, the pre-exercise TEWL values (at 4 h) on the untreated site were 1-1.8 g/m2h higher than (P less than 0.001) on the treated site, due to emotional sweating. Thus, accurate baseline TEWL measurements may only be made after anticholinergic suppression of the sweat glands. In this way, accurate TEWL measurements may be made even outside favourable laboratory conditions, at industrial sites etc., where circumstances are far from ideal. The effect of this agent applied to a skin site previously irritated artificially by a 24-h occlusive sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS, 0.3 ml, 0.5% aq.) patch, was also investigated in 17 subjects. In all subjects, 4 h after removal, sweating (on exercise) was completely inhibited on the scopolamine-treated site, pre-irritated with SLS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hydroxypropyl cellulose, ordinarily used in the TRUE TestTM, induced crystallization and inadequate release of benzocaine. Addition of the crystal poison glucose caused rapid degradation of the caines. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) proved to be a vehicle which incorporated the caines in a stable preparation on the patch. Rapid release of the caines from this vehicle when applied on membranes was confirmed by in vivo patch test studies.\r"

A questionnaire was sent to 121 machine operators who had been diagnosed over a 5-year period. Life table analysis of the 100 replies (83%) revealed a poor prognosis both for those who had continued to work with soluble oils and for those who had stopped. 78% (95% confidence intervals: 63%-94%) of those who continued to work with soluble oils had not healed 2 years after diagnosis. 70% (95% confidence intervals: 56%-83%) of those who stopped working with soluble oil had not healed 2 years after discontinuing contact. Both groups were divided into 4 subgroups with different combinations of aetiological components: allergic and endogenous, non-allergic and endogenous, allergic and non-endogenous, non-allergic and non-endogenous. No significant difference in outcome emerged in either the discontinued contact group or the continued contact group between any aetiological subgroups. Patients who discontinued contact with soluble oils fell into 2 groups: those who healed rapidly and those who developed a chronic dermatitis. 11 of the 15 patients who had healed after 2 years had done so within the first 3 months following cessation of contact. No factor could be identified to distinguish those with the more favourable prognosis. The implications of this study for the management of soluble oil dermatitis are discussed.\r"

Acute (stripping, sandpaper abrasion, needle abrasion, delipidization) and subacute (irritant and allergic contact dermatitis) injuries were induced by physical or chemical treatment of the skin. Absorption of solvents was quantified by blood analysis. Induction of acute injuries markedly altered the absorption pattern of the solvents and correlated to their water solubility. Absorption of toluene and trichloroethane was reduced and that of butanol was increased compared to normal untreated skin. Subacute injuries had a less pronounced effect. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis reduced the absorption of toluene and trichloroethane, and no effect was seen for butanol. For hydrophobic solvents, it is concluded that in acute injuries strata other than stratum corneum hold the barrier properties.\r"

Phase diagram, birefringence microscopy and droplet size distribution analysis were used for characterization of the preparations. It was found that skin absorption of the solvents depends on the type of surfactant, type of preparation and also on phase equilibria in the systems studied. The presence of nonionic surfactants in the solvents and in a microemulsion with butanol caused skin absorption to decrease. A reduced uptake of solvents from o/w emulsions was observed. The absorption of butanol from a microemulsion with anionic surfactant was greater than from the pure solvent.\r"

We investigated whether the degree of histamine airway responsiveness would predict the development and extent of lidocaine-induced bronchoconstriction in 20 asthmatic patients. The provocation concentration of histamine producing a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PC20) was measured. On a separate day, challenge with 6 ml 4 percent lidocaine (Xylocaine 4 percent topical) was performed. There was no correlation between the response to lidocaine and the histamine PC20. Five patients (25 percent) showed a fall in FEV1 of greater than 15 percent (max 42.1 percent). Three responders were rechallenged double-blind with the commercial 4 percent lidocaine preparation and with a 4 percent preservative-free lidocaine solution. There was no difference in the response to these two solutions. These results demonstrate that inhaled topical lidocaine induces bronchoconstriction in a significant proportion of patients with asthma. This response is not related to airway histamine responsiveness or to the preservative in the lidocaine preparation.\r"

The subjects with RA had a significantly greater mean BAL histamine level than the normal subjects, (313 +/- 154 pg/ml vs 18 +/- 8 pg/ml; p less than 0.05). When the subjects with RA were divided into three groups based on chest radiograms (1 = normal; 2 = pleural disease only; 3 = interstitial or nodular disease), we found that subjects in group 3 had significantly lower values for TLC and D. Subjects in group 3 also had higher percentages of BAL neutrophils and eosinophils and higher BAL histamine levels (group 1, 115 +/- 52 pg/ml; group 2, 30 +/- 30 pg/ml; and group 3, 1,182 +/- 709 pg of histamine per milliliter). Moreover, BAL histamine levels were negatively correlated with TLC (r = -0.46; p = 0.01) and FVC (r = -0.45; p = 0.01) and positively correlated with BAL neutrophils (r = 0.6; p = 0.0003) and BAL eosinophils (r = 0.89; p = 0.0001). These data suggest that the BAL histamine level may be a useful marker to determine the activity of pulmonary disease in RA.\r"

We present seven patients with seropositive RA and subcutaneous nodules who had new pulmonary nodule(s) noted on chest roentgenograms. All but one were current smokers. Carcinoma was found in all patients at bronchoscopy or thoracotomy. Four patients had solitary nodules (one was cavitary); the remaining three patients had multiple bilateral nodules that cavitated in one case. All patients had interstitial abnormality (peribronchial/vascular thickening) with basal predominance in three, and there was evidence of pleural thickening/fluid in three patients.

In subjects with normal coronary arteries, dipyridamole induced an increase in LVEF (from 66 +/- 8 to 76 +/- 8 percent; mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001); in patients with significant coronary artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 75 percent narrowing of at least one major vessel), dipyridamole injection did not affect LVEF (from 63 +/- 12 to 62 +/- 12 percent). In ten patients a complete, successful PTCA was performed and the RNV with the dipyridamole test repeated. The EF did not change with the dipyridamole test before PTCA (63 +/- 7 to 65 +/- 9 percent), but increased significantly after PTCA (62 +/- 11 to 70 +/- 9 percent; p less than 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity of EF changes after dipyridamole infusion were 75 and 76 percent, respectively. The test produced no major side effects or complications.

Patients with either no or incomplete redistribution at 4 h had repeat imaging 18 to 48 h later. Delayed redistribution was seen in 8/26 (31 percent). Four had incomplete and four had no redistribution at 4 h. Delayed redistribution with SPECT 201Tl is more common than generally appreciated, and we recommend delayed images in patients with fixed perfusion defects or incomplete redistribution at 4-h imaging, particularly in patients with previous infarctions for whom a revascularization procedure is being considered.\r"

Normal volume-related values for both mechanics and diffusion were seen throughout the range of severity of disease. The ratio of mechanics to lung volume did not correlate with the ratio of diffusion to lung volume in the same patient. Volume relationships of mechanics and diffusion failed to distinguish pathologic predominance of fibrosis or inflammation/granulomas. These ratios failed to predict reversibility in patients who had repeated tests. These results suggest that in patients with interstitial lung disease the significance of \"volume-adjustment\" of mechanics and diffusion should be viewed with caution; these parameters do not appear to contribute to the assessment of pathophysiology or correlate with clinical spectrum of interstitial lung diseases.\r"

These results could be explained by the short interval between diagnosis and follow-up. In the current study, we saw 28 subjects with occupational asthma at two intervals, 2.3 years (range, three months to 5.7 years) and 5.8 years (range, 4.3 to 10.9 years) after the cessation of exposure. Various causes of occupational asthma were included. The diagnosis was confirmed in 26 of the cases by specific inhalation challenges in the laboratory, and in the remaining two cases by combined monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates and bronchial responsiveness. All subjects had symptoms of asthma at both follow-up assessments. There were no changes in the need for medication, spirometry, or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Depending on the interval of the follow-up, four to six subjects required inhaled steroid agents in addition to the usual bronchodilators, 11 had FEV1 less than 80 percent of predicted, and 26 or 27 had an abnormal PC 20 histamine. Only two subjects demonstrated sustained improvement in PC 20 at the first and second follow-ups, and one other showed changes during the second follow-up assessment which were not present at the first. We conclude that except for three subjects, the need for medication did not diminish, nor did airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness improve in this group of subjects with occupational asthma long after exposure ended. These results differ from other studies, which demonstrated that some recovery takes place in a greater proportion of individuals.\r"

Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were found in seven of 20 cases (35 percent). These abnormalities were not seen in a matched control group.

Cox proportional hazards survival analyses indicated a gender effect, with women having a much better survival rate than men. In women, but not in men, there was a strong association between mortality and the RDI. In addition, patients with obstructive sleep apnea had a greater tendency to die in their sleep. These results show that respiratory disturbances in sleep are an extremely significant risk factor for mortality in elderly women who are in poor health.\r"

We studied three patients with hypothyroidism presenting with fatigue, dyspnea, exercise limitation, and in two, chronic alveolar hypoventilation (PaCO2 of 51 and 75 mm Hg) before and after thyroid hormone replacement. In all patients diaphragmatic strength as determined by the maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure was low (2, 13, and 64 cm H2O) and improved with therapy (86, 84, and 90 cm H2O). Similarly, all patients manifested a fatiguing breathing pattern, as determined by the diaphragmatic tension time index. These values (0.22, 0.55, and 0.36) decreased after hormone replacement (0.16, 0.20, and 0.15). These changes were associated with the correction of hypercarbia in the two patients with hypoventilation and an improvement in lung volumes and exercise endurance in all patients. This study confirms that in patients with hypothyroidism diaphragmatic dysfunction occurs more frequently than has been suspected and might be of varying severity. This dysfunction reverses with adequate hormone replacement.\r"

Inequalities of VA/Q were estimated in the respiratory steady state using the multiple inert gas technique. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure was low (7.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg) and the cardiac output high (Q = 11.0 +/- 2.06 L/min), indicating a low PVR. The VA/Q mismatching of the ventilated and perfused units ranged from mild to moderate, but a large percentage of Q flowed through unventilated areas. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between predicted and measured PaO2 (9.27 +/- 5.9 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), which was attributed to either an unmeasured postpulmonary shunt (between portal and pulmonary vein) or a diffusion defect. The impairment in gas exchange in these patients is thus due primarily to an intrapulmonary, and possibly extrapulmonary, shunt. This was thought to be due mainly to an impaired regulatory mechanism of the microcirculation by the hepatic dysfunction.\r"

The same test was used to determine whether patients with or without physical symptoms or with various auscultatory findings responded differently. Compared with 105 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects, the MVP patients showed significantly higher mean heart rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and rate-pressure (double) product, at both rest and exercise; significantly lower mean near-maximal physical working capacity (PWC170); significantly higher incidence of both arrhythmias and nonspecific ST and T wave changes; and a significantly longer mean corrected QT interval. None of these findings was associated with the presence of physical symptoms or with specific auscultatory or echocardiographic findings. These observations strongly suggest an autonomic nervous system imbalance in some young women with MVP, irrespective of whether physical symptoms are present.\r"

  ".W": "Symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with radionuclide angiography was performed on 11 patients with severe mitral regurgitation (who were not receiving vasodilators), to assess changes in left ventricular volume, regurgitant fraction, forward flow and regurgitant flow during exercise. All patients were in normal sinus rhythm with a normal resting ejection fraction (greater than 0.50). During exercise, the end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, ejection fraction, and regurgitant fraction of the left ventricle did not change significantly. The forward cardiac index increased by 86 percent (p less than 0.01) with exercise. This increase was explained by an 87 percent increase in the heart rate (p less than 0.01); there was no significant change in the forward stroke volume index. Although the regurgitant stroke volume index declined by 12 percent with exercise (p = 0.07), the regurgitant flow increased markedly by 64 percent (p less than 0.01) to a mean of 8.2 L/min/m2. These data indicate that in patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the increase in the exercise forward flow is totally dependent on the heart rate response. There is a marked increase in regurgitant flow during exercise, which presumably contributes to dyspnea.\r"

At least one aneuploid cell subpopulation was seen in 91 percent of NSCLC and 50 percent on SCLC. To show intratumor heterogeneity, multiple-site sampling was done whenever possible in both primary tumor and metastatic sites, revealing a high incidence of multiclonality (50 percent). Although diploid tumors were rare, they associated with a higher survival rate than aneuploid monoclonal and multiclonal tumors with hypoploid and/or hypertetraploid clones, which had the lowest survival. Cellular DNA content analysis in patients with lung tumors may be useful in prognostic evaluation.\r"

Recently, it has been shown that PaO2 may in fact be higher during the initial 20 to 120 seconds recovery phase, compared to rest and peak exercise levels. Since it is not established to what extent this improvement persists, we investigated the changes in oxygenation during this phase in patients with CAO. We measured arterial blood gas values, expired gases and ventilation at rest, peak exercise and during the first seven minutes of recovery in 18 male patients with moderate-severe CAO. Mean rest PaO2 (77 mm Hg) and peak exercise PaO2 (76 mm Hg) did not change significantly. Compared to peak exercise, PaO2 was significantly higher during recovery at one minute (93 mm Hg, p = 0.005) and at four minutes (91 mm Hg, p = 0.005), but not at seven minutes (86 mm Hg, p = 0.155) after exercise. All of the recovery PaO2 levels were significantly higher than resting PaO2. These results indicate that during the postexercise recovery period, oxygenation is better than at peak exercise or at rest. Regression analysis of the data predicts that oxygenation may return to resting levels 8 to 9 minutes after cessation of exercise.\r"

The 33 patients in whom distant recurrence had occurred within 12 months of curative operation, were then evaluated to establish the relationship between the recurrent site and the preoperative examination: negative scans on the examination failed to predict the low incidence of early distant recurrence. Those data suggest that the routine use of radionuclide or CT scans is of no benefit to asymptomatic patients with local, early disease.\r"

The BTG:PF4 ratio was 2:1 or greater in BAL of ARDS patients and of control subjects with other lung diseases, suggesting in vivo release. In ARDS patients, the ratio of TSP to BTG exceeded that usually found in plasma. In ARDS patients in group 2, BAL levels of TSP, BTG, and total protein correlated strongly with the composite injury scores that were used to quantitate their degree of lung injury. Elevated levels of platelet-derived proteins, which modulate chemotaxis of inflammatory cells and promote connective tissue reorganization, occur in the alveolar compartment of ARDS and ILD patients but are usually undetectable in BAL of healthy control subjects. Levels in these patients in BAL fluid are nonspecific indices of the severity of lung injury in patients with ARDS.\r"

There was no correlation between the localization of the pleural effusions and that of the abdominal incisions. There was a positive correlation between atelectasis and pleural effusion, but no evidence of a causal relationship. Pleural effusions might be related to postoperative sodium and water retention, and aggravated by an age-related relative cardiac decompensation. Early postoperative pleural effusions are common and do not require specific treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxemia occurs during routine hemodialysis and may contribute to morbidity, but its cause is not well understood. We reasoned that patients with COPD would be more vulnerable to abnormalities in gas exchange with dialysis. Thus, to investigate the cause of dialysis-related hypoxemia, we measured gas exchange in a group of stable dialysis patients with normal pulmonary function (n = 6) and a group of dialysis patients with COPD (n = 6). Measurements were made predialysis, at 1 h, and postdialysis with both acetate and bicarbonate dialysates. Acetate dialysis decreased PaO2 in normal and COPD patients at 1 h and postdialysis. Acetate-induced hypoxemia was associated with reduced respiratory CO2 excretion and hypoventilation but PaCO2 did not change. This decrease in CO2 excretion resulted from CO2 fixation during acetate metabolism and modest CO2 loss across the dialyzer. Hypoxemia occurred only postdialysis with bicarbonate dialysate in normal and COPD patients. An increased P(A-a)O2 occurred postdialysis with both dialysates, and was most consistently observed in the COPD patients. In summary, at least two mechanisms contribute to dialysis hypoxemia. With acetate dialysate, alveolar hypoventilation from CO2 unloading occurs at 1 h and postdialysis due to acetate metabolism. However, abnormalities in ventilation/perfusion contribute to postdialysis hypoxemia observed with both dialysates. In addition, the decrement in PaO2 associated with dialysis is similar in normal and COPD patients, although preexisting COPD makes postdialysis changes more apparent.\r"

Among them, CBF was coded mainly in blue in 32 patients, showing that the flow runs from proximal to distal. In some cases, yellowish and/or reddish components were seen, suggesting the occurrence of aliasing associated with augmentation of flow velocity or flow turbulence. The fast Fourier transformation spectrogram of the pulsed Doppler sampled in the colored flow showed a typical flow velocity pattern of the LAD, which mainly consisted of a predominantly diastolic component. These results indicate that the transesophageal color Doppler technique is advantageous in noninvasively imaging CBF. It should be further sought whether flow abnormality due to coronary stenosis could be determined by this technique.\r"

Patients with PaO2 values less than 60 mm Hg, the highest mean PAPs and the poorest spirometric performances demonstrated no significant changes in VA/Q distributions or PaO2 after terbutaline. Cardiac output increased 40 to 60 percent in all patients after terbutaline with an increase in tissue oxygen delivery. Mean PAP did not change in any patient after terbutaline and pulmonary vasodilatation was indicated by a decrease of calculated static PVR. The decrease of PaO2 after terbutaline in COPD is related to a further deterioration of existing VA/Q relationships. The cause of these effects and lack of such responses in patients with more advanced disease are discussed.\r"

There is little information about the magnitude of cholinergic tone in patients with COPD as compared with normal subjects. As an index of the amount of cholinergic tone we measured the maximum increase in FEV1 following administration of an optimal dose of the anticholinergic agent atropine methonitrate. The study included nine normal nonsmoking subjects, ten normal smokers and 22 subjects with mild to moderately severe COPD. We found that normal nonsmokers had smallest increases in FEV1 following atropine methonitrate administration. Responses of subjects with airway disease were progressively greater. Greatest responses occurred in the group of subjects with prebronchodilator FEV1 values less than 55 percent of predicted. The most plausible explanation for this is that cholinergic tone in COPD is increased in proportion to the severity of airway disease. Other explanations are possible.\r"

There was no correlation of neutrophil or lymphocyte counts with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and none of the cell types was correlated with airway obstruction. Our findings support the hypotheses that macrophages may be important in the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children with asthma and that they may modulate bronchial responsiveness both directly and by recruitment of eosinophils.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine whether esophageal acid stimulation in asthmatic patients can provoke clinically detectable bronchospasm and if a possible response is correlated to bronchial reactivity. Eight patients with chronic asthma and GER disease were investigated on three occasions with a histamine challenge test followed by acid provocation of the esophagus. Assessment of bronchial function was made by FEV1, chest auscultation, and respiratory symptoms. While symptoms and signs of bronchoconstriction induced by esophageal acid stimulation were not detected clinically on any occasion, there was a significant correlation between histamine reactivity and the subclinical bronchospasm following acid provocation. It is concluded that esophageal acid stimulation during daytime in the majority of asthmatic patients is not a strong and immediate trigger of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a pathologic finding common to various injuries to the lung of either definite or idiopathic etiology. Since the presentation of patients with idiopathic BOOP varies, we studied 16 patients with BOOP on pulmonary histology to define more distinct and homogeneous clinical and imaging profiles of idiopathic BOOP. We distinguished three groups of patients: group 1 (n = 4), with multiple patchy migratory pulmonary involvement of the pneumonia type. Their clinical course was subacute, with cough, fever, weight loss, mild dyspnea, and increased ESR. Chest x-ray film and CT scan showed multiple alveolar opacities. All patients completely recovered with corticosteroid therapy but relapsed when therapy was stopped too rapidly. Group 2 (n = 5) had solitary pulmonary involvement of the pneumonia type occurring in a similar clinical context. Since carcinoma was suspected, they underwent surgical excision of the pneumonic area and recovered without relapse. Group 3 patients (n = 7) presented with diffuse pulmonary involvement of the interstitial lung disease type. They had more progressive onset of more severe dyspnea, crackles heard over all lung surfaces, and interstitial opacities with or without alveolar opacities on chest imaging. Improvement with corticosteroid therapy was obtained in only three patients. In all three groups, lung function test results showed a restrictive pattern. The obstructive pattern characteristic of pure bronchiolitis obliterans was found in none. BAL showed a mixed pattern (increase of both lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells) in the patients of the first two groups. Thus, we distinguished three characteristic clinical and imaging profiles in patients with idiopathic BOOP: multiple patchy pneumonia, solitary pneumonia, and diffuse interstitial lung disease. These profiles are so different that they should be distinguished in clinical studies of idiopathic BOOP.\r"

Four hundred eighty-six patients (263 men and 223 women) were submitted to colectomy with or without proctectomy. In elective cases, proctocolectomy was the procedure of choice until the 1980s, when subtotal colectomy became more common. In acute cases subtotal colectomy was the procedure of choice during the entire period. Major complications developed in 162 patients (33 percent) and 103 (21 percent) underwent another operation. The frequency of major complications increased, with the urgency of intervention being 25 percent in elective cases and 46 percent in acute cases (P less than .001). The postoperative mortality was 1.7 percent in 301 elective cases and 9.2 percent in 185 acute cases (P less than .001). The overall postoperative mortality was 4.5 percent and fell from 13 percent during 1960 to 1964 to 2.0 percent during 1980 to 1984 (P less than .01). In acute cases, the mortality during the same two periods fell from 36 to 3.0 percent (P less than .001). The postoperative mortality for proctocolectomy (2.7 percent) was significantly lower (P less than .01) than for subtotal colectomy (9.0 percent). Seventy-four percent of the patients treated by subtotal colectomy were acute cases, however, with a mortality of 11 percent and only 30 percent of the proctocolectomy cases were acute cases, with a mortality of 6.5 percent.\r"

Fifteen procedures, including six exploratory laparotomies, four transperineal explorations, two transsacral explorations, one transvaginal biopsy, one brachytherapy, and one transanal polypectomy, were performed. Two patients had previous low anterior resection, seven abdominoperineal resection, and one a rectal polypectomy. Five patients had previous pelvic radiation therapy. Reoperation was indicated by elevated CEA levels in seven patients (70 percent), persistent pelvic pain in six (60 percent), and a suspicious radiologic study in seven (70 percent). RIGS system localized tumors verified by histopatholoy in all ten patients (100 percent); one patient with a positive CT scan and probe findings lacked histopathologic confirmation on frozen section, but had a tumor confirmed on permanent histology. Five major abdominal operations were avoided; in five patients major modifications were made in the surgical procedure based on probe findings. Six received chemotherapy or radiation therapy based on findings of the RIGS system. In six patients with negative or equivocal CT scans, the RIGS system localized histopathologically confirmed tumor. Major abdominal procedures can be avoided, the surgical approach modified, and other modes of therapy instituted earlier with the use of the RIGS system.\r"

The severity of disease was also classified (stages I to IV). Postoperative mortality rates in the first two groups were lower than that of the Hartmann group (3.4 vs. 15.3 percent). The mean length of initial hospitalization was 16 +/- 1.2 days for group I, 18.2 +/- 4.4 days for group II, 19.4 +/- 2 days for group III, 26.4 +/- 4.4 days for group IV (P less than .05, t-test group IV vs. groups I, II, and III). Complications in the Hartmann group were high with a 23 percent wound infection rate and mortality after closure of colostomy and bowel reconstruction was 3.8 percent. These data demonstrate that primary resection with anastomosis is a satisfactory operation for the majority of patients with perforated diverticulitis (stages I to III), and there appears to be no clinical indication to use the three-staged operation.\r"

The Jass system revealed four prognostic groups when all patients or only Dukes' B and C cases were examined; however, the magnitude of differences between groups I and II and III and IV were small. Dukes' classification, as defined in this study, revealed five prognostic groups. A statistically strong association between the Jass and Dukes systems was observed. Although histologic grade permitted further prognostic discrimination of all Dukes stages except A, only the Jass system allowed for the subdivision of C cases with up to four nodes positive for metastases. Those in that group had survival rates comparable to B cases (no nodal involvement) when scores of I and II were found. The distributions of the patients in the extremes of the Jass and Dukes systems (C2 as defined) were almost similar. The findings indicate that the Jass system is a valid prognostic method for patients with rectal carcinoma. In this material, however, it basically allowed for only two major prognostic groups whereas five were noted by the Dukes method. These results, as well as the more objective nature of Dukes' classification, warrant its continued use for prognosis and therapeutic decisions for patients with rectal cancer.\r"

The mean and range from ileostomy closure were 3.5 months (1.5 to 12) and 21.7 months (13 to 32), respectively. The mean maximum resting pressure (MRP) ( +/- SEM and range) was 81.3 mm Hg ( +/- 6.0 and 61 to 112.5) and 50.0 mm Hg ( +/- 6.2 and 17 to 62.5), respectively, for the Js and Jm groups (P less than .003). None of the Js patients experienced leakage or wore a pad, while in the Jm group 14 percent experienced minor leakage during the day and 28 percent at night. Seventy-one percent of the Jm group wore a pad at some point. Anal sphincter resting pressures and continence were better in the Js group. The improvement in MRP resulted from avoidance of injury to the internal and sphincter during dilatation and mucosectomy and the maintenance of a normal anal canal that allowed for proper closure.\r"

Expression of CEA, both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of the epithelial cells, was found to be moderately correlated with the severity of dysplasia in all adenomas. This relation was not observed with the SC expression in the adenomas. Both CEA and SC expressions were found to be increased with the size of the adenomas, but only in the villous adenomas and not in the tubular adenomas. These findings indicate that evaluation of CEA and SC expression does not add much additional information to the known parameters of malignant potential of colonic adenomas, such as dysplasia, size, and pattern of mucosal growth.\r"

Patients with prolapsing hemorrhoids demonstrated greater degrees of sampling responses, 12.9 +/- 1.9/hour, vs. 7.4 +/- 2.0/hour (mean +/- SEM) in controls (P less than .05). Ultraslow wave and giant ultraslow wave activity were seen frequently in the patient group occupying more than 30 percent of recording. The external sphincter demonstrated much greater electrical activity (spike potentials) in patients with hemorrhoids than in controls both by day, 24.9 +/- 11.0/10 min vs. 12.8 +/- 3.2/10 min (P less than .02), and by night, 7.4 +/- 2.6 min vs. 1.6 +/- 1.3/10 min (P less than .03). Sleep electrical activity in the presence of hemorrhoids did not differ significantly from that of controls during waking, 7.4 +/- 2.6/10 min vs. 12.8 +/- 3.2/10 min (P less than .1). No difference in phasic and periodic rectal motor activity was noted between patient and control groups. This demonstrates the application of prolonged assessment of anorectal motility and external sphincter activity in a patient group. Abnormalities previously documented in patients with hemorrhoids using conventional manometric tests were confirmed. In addition, evidence of increased external sphincter function during waking and sleep may have implications in the pathophysiology of this disorder.\r"

Recurrence was diagnosed in 214 patients (41.2 percent), 179 of whom (34.5 percent) had received blood transfusions and 35 of whom (6.7 percent) had not (P less than .001). Exclusion of the right-sided colonic tumors still showed that recurrence was more common in transfused than nontransfused patients (135 [47.2 percent] vs. 25 [22.5 percent]; P less than .001). Recurrence in patients transfused only during surgery (N = 201) was higher than in nontransfused patients (P less than .001) and, similarly, all patients transfused during surgery (N = 297) had an increased risk (P less than .001). Among patients with rectal cancer, transfusion increased the risk of recurrence in those treated by abdominoperineal resection (P less than .02), but this was not the case in those treated by sphincter-saving resection (P = .2). Hierarchical log linear analysis of all dependent factors (Dukes' stage, histologic grade, age, sex, site, elective, or emergency procedure) showed that Dukes' stage and blood transfusion had the most significant effects on the development of recurrence (chi 2 = 54.04, df = 6, P less than .0001 and chi 2 = 13.93, df = 3, P less than .003). The risk of recurrence following curative surgery for colorectal cancer is markedly increased by blood transfusion on the day of operation.\r"

This \"triple-stapled\" end-to-end anastomosis was performed with one circular staple line and two linear staple lines, eliminating the need for a colotomy or purse-string suture. The fact that the anvil and anvil stem of a new circular stapling device (Premium EEA) can be detached from the frame of the instrument allows the anvil stem to be brought out through the proximal linear stapled colon. The trocar mounted on the main stem of the circular stapler allows the stem of the main device to be brought out through the distal staple line. Thus, a totally stapled colonic anastomosis is created after mating the anvil stem and main stem of the instrument. The new anastomosis was evaluated radiographically and at necropsy. The use of this technique resulted in no clinically detectable leaks, suggesting that it may facilitate the performance of anterior resections in humans.\r"

The results of therapy were assessed in terms of ovarian response and pregnancy outcome. Ovarian response was evaluated employing basal body temperature (BBT) to define follicular, luteal, and cycle lengths, and a midluteal serum progesterone (P) level and the integrated luteal P to define luteal adequacy. Pregnancy outcome was evaluated in the categories of total pregnancy, live birth, first trimester abortion, and fecundity rates. There were no significant differences noted between the groups who started CC on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th day of cycle in terms of anovulation rates (12% to 21%), luteal dysfunction (28% to 39%), and normal ovulation rates (42% to 57%). Pregnancy was achieved in 31% (n = 27/87) of patients with a spontaneous abortion rate of 19% (n = 5/27). The fecundity rates ranged between 5.7% and 9.4%. Pregnancy outcomes also were not significantly different between the groups. Significantly shorter luteal phase length and longer follicular phase length were observed in the cycles with luteal dysfunction. The luteal progesterone parameters, including midluteal serum P concentration, the integrated luteal P, and the luteal P amplitude were significantly lower in the cycles with luteal dysfunction.\r"

The patient twice underwent transsphenoidal microsurgery to partially remove the adenoma. Thereafter, a trial with bromocriptine was initiated. Normal levels of FSH and LH were observed after 6 weeks of treatment as well as improvement of visual field examination.

The treatment resulted in normalization of PRL secretion in 71% of the women at a once-daily dose of less than or equal to 0.100 mg. All women responded with a significant decrease in serum PRL. Menstrual function normalized in all women except 1, whereas galactorrhea disappeared in all but 2 patients. During the observation period, four pregnancies were recorded with an additional three in the immediate posttreatment period. Until now, four healthy children have been born. Regarding tolerability, women with fair or poor response bromocriptine (Parlodel) in the past tolerated CV 205-502 better. Two women with no PRL decrease while on Parlodel responded with a decrease while on CV 205-502. All safety parameters remained normal while on treatment, and no significant changes were observed in blood pressure (supine and standing), pulse rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.

Gonadotropins, prolactin (PRL) 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2), estrone (E1), progesterone (P), androstenedione (A), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) remained in the follicular phase range. Total testosterone (TT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) decreased, whereas free testosterone (FT) slightly increased. Metabolic studies showed a decrease of total triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and VLDL cholesterol, parallel to the decrease of associated apoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoprotein B increased during therapy. The results suggest that gestrinone possesses antiestrogenic, androgenic, and progestigenic effects at therapeutic dosages both by acting on central and peripheral steroid receptors. For its efficacy and good tolerance, gestrinone may be considered an option for treating endometriosis.\r"

Prolactin (PRL) levels were measured on the morning of cycle day 3, days of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, and peak estradiol (E2), and in the midluteal phase. Women were divided into high (H: peak E2 greater than 1,000 pg/mL, n = 51), intermediate (I:peak E2: 500 to 800 pg/mL, n = 50), or low (L:peak E2 less than 400 pg/mL, n = 50) E2 response groups. There was no difference in the incidence of hyperprolactinemia on cycle day 3 between the response groups (H:16%, I: 12%, and L:8%). However, high responders had a higher incidence of hyperprolactinemia than intermediate or low responders on all other study days. The incidence of hyperprolactinemia was greater than baseline (cycle day 3) only in the high responders on the day of peak E2. Serum prolactin was strongly correlated with peak E2 (r = 0.41). There were no differences in the number of preovulatory oocytes retrieved or fertilized or the pregnancy rates between hyperprolactinemic and euprolactinemic patients in each response group or when all hyperprolactinemic and euprolactinemic patients, regardless of E2 response, were compared. Transient hyperprolactinemia during gonadotropin stimulation for IVF occurs and correlates with E2 response but has no impact on IVF outcome.\r"

Thirty minutes after anesthesia, there was a 120-ng/mL rise in serum prolactin (PRL) in control patients versus an insignificant change in women given bromocriptine. Levels of PRL in follicular fluid were significantly less, and estradiol (E2) levels were higher (P less than 0.05) in all bromocriptine-treated patients compared with controls, whereas follicular fluid levels of progesterone (P), inhibin activity, and midluteal serum P were unaffected. Although fertilization and pregnancy rates were similar, a greater proportion of fertilized oocytes from bromocriptine-treated patients advanced to cleaving embryos compared with controls (95% versus 63%, respectively; P less than 0.001). We conclude that bromocriptine, given before anesthesia, can suppress transient, anesthesia-induced hyperprolactinemia and dramatically alter follicular fluid concentrations of PRL and E2. Although these changes in hormonal milieu affected neither oocyte fertilization nor pregnancy rate in our IVF patients, they seemed to have a positive influence on embryonic development after IVF.\r"

Results of the first 28 couples treated are presented. The pregnancy rate for 39 cycles reaching attempts at oocyte retrieval is 18%. The procedural aspects, ethical issues, legal issues, and subsequent program development are summarized. Recommendations are of a similar program. There are numerous potential pitfalls and traps for the unwary, but our experience has thus far been gratifyingly positive, and we endorse the further provision, observation, and documentation of this controversial approach to the care of the infertile couple.\r"

Before actual transfer, the ampulla of each tube was measured to determine the depth at which gametes could be placed. Fifty-seven transfers were made with four oocytes into a single tube; of these, when gametes were deposited deeper than 4 cm, the pregnancy rate was higher than when they were placed at between 3 to 4 cm (69.6% compared with 41.2%). Presumably, a deeper placement is more secure and decreases the likelihood of gamete displacement. The pregnancy rate also rose with the number of oocytes used: from 0% with a single oocyte to 42.9% with four oocytes.\r"

In 10 females a tubal pathology was present, and in the normal female patients repeated intrauterine insemination with husband sperm had failed. The presence of an andrological factor in 17 male patients did not influence the fertilization and the cleavage of the retrieved oocytes. Although the fertilization rate of 45.8% was significantly lower than in patients with tubal pathology, the pregnancy rate was 34.2% per started cycle and 44.8% per replacement. Furthermore, the embryos were of lesser quality than in couples with tubal and idiopathic infertility. This study suggests that IVF could be considered as a useful therapeutic approach for couples with a positive direct mixed antiglobulin reaction test before advising them the use of heterologous sperm.\r"

Treatment of 20 human semen samples with 3.69 x 10(-7) to 3.69 x 10(-13) M PAF resulted in statistically significant increases in motility. Treatment of spermatozoa with lyso-PAF (the biologically inactive form of PAF) showed no change in motility.

Doses of 5 and 25 mg of purified antibody were injected into patients. Monoclonal antibody serum levels dropped to 0 within 1 to 5 days. Human antibodies directed against mouse immunoglobulins were not detected at up to 41 days after injection. In one patient, the tubal pregnancy resolved, as confirmed by hCG levels of less than 10 mUl/mL and by tubal patency at hysterosalpingography. The time of resolution was 30 days. In two patients, salpingectomy was performed because of persistence of elevated hCG levels, whereas HT13 had a striking effect on progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) serum levels. The injection of anti-hCG antibody did not appear to interfere with the subsequent fertility of patients, and two out of three patients later developed a successful pregnancy. While the precise role of antibody injection in the interruption of ectopic pregnancy remains speculative, the injection of monoclonal anti-hCG antibody appears to induce a dramatic decrease in the production of both P and E2.\r"

Each formulation was tested at two dose levels (100 and 500 micrograms). All women without exception developed anti-hCG antibodies having hCG-binding capacity above 20 ng mL-1 (0.5 nM), a level considered to be the threshold for prevention of pregnancy. Formulations A and B gave relatively better immunogenic response in human subjects than M. In each case, the antibody response was reversible. The mean duration of response above 20 ng was 35 to 37 weeks for formulation A, 34 weeks for B, and 17 to 20 weeks for M. Antibodies induced by three formulations of the vaccine had high-affinity (Ka 10(9)-10(10)M-1) for binding with hCG. They were devoid of cross-reaction with human follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone but, as expected, cross-reacted with human LH. Antibodies were competent to block the hCG induced ovarian hyperemia.\r"

Serum E2 levels were similar between groups and similar to normally-cycling controls. With vaginal administration of E2, a burst effect was noted, with marked elevation 1 hour after insertion. The pattern with oral administration was more consistent, although marked conversion to estrone occurred. The P cylinder and suppositories delivered similar levels, with diminution of P in some patients with the cylinder. Despite apparent limitations, endometrial histology was normal after each cycle; both groups achieved pregnancies. Administration of E2 and P by polysiloxane vaginal rings achieved hormonal levels similar to oral micronized E2 and P vaginal suppositories. Endometrial biopsies after the stimulated cycle were appropriately mature.\r"

Treatment with physiological doses of estradiol and progesterone induced PRL production and stimulated cell proliferation, resulting in multilayering with an increase of the saturation density. Electron microscopy showed the development of gap junctions, whereas immunofluorescence revealed a dense pericellular matrix containing fibronectin and laminin. These findings show that human endometrial stromal cells in culture respond to physiological doses of ovarian hormones with ultrastructural, proliferative, and biochemical changes that are characteristic of decidualization in vivo. This culture system thus provides an in vitro model for human decidualization.\r"

In addition, alterations in PGF2 alpha synthesis and degradation in response to 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) were examined to clarify the mechanism of steroid modulation of endometrial PG production (n = 12). Endometrium was maintained in tissue culture and the concentration of PGF2 alpha and 13,14 dehydro-15 keto F2 alpha (DHKF2 alpha) was determined in spent media by radioimmunoassay. Prostaglandin F2 alpha and DHKF2 alpha output from luteal endometrium exposed to P and E2 + P were both significantly reduced when compared with no addition or E2 treatments. This implies that the modulation of PGF2 alpha output by P in vitro is secondary to altered synthesis. There was an increase in PGF2 alpha output from late luteal endometrium when compared with early luteal endometrium in the P and E2 + P treatments, but DHKF2 alpha remained unchanged. These data imply that the temporal increase in PGF2 alpha output is the result of alterations in both PG synthesis and catabolism.\r"

Variation of the time exposure to DMSO and sucrose, and cryoprotectants concentrations, followed by extraction-dilution in sucrose without freezing made it possible to study chemical toxicities. Variation of cryoprotectant concentrations followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen, thawing, extraction, and dilution made it possible to choose optimal conditions for vitrification. The sucrose concentration upon extraction after freezing and thawing which was lower than that during soaking enhanced the oocyte survival rate as did the choice of duration and temperature of soaking. No parthenogenetical activation of these unfertilized ovum was observed. This study indicates that with a certain combination of DMSO and sucrose concentrations up to 80% of morphologically intact human oocytes can be recovered after rapid freezing and thawing.\r"

Sixty-two clinical pregnancies were established, representing a pregnancy rate of 28.4%. Excluding 49 cases of male factor infertility, the pregnancy rate was 34.9%. Pregnancy rates were not significantly different according to age, cause of female factor infertility, parity, duration of infertility, stimulation protocol, or estradiol level. The only variables having a strong association with pregnancy were sperm and egg parameters. Sperm motility and morphology were statistically more important than sperm density. Based on odds ratios calculated from multiple logistic analysis, pregnancy was 3.80 times more likely if three or more fully mature eggs were transferred, 0.34 times as likely if motility were less than or equal to 30%, and 0.22 times as likely if normal morphology was less than or equal to 50%, controlling for other egg and sperm factors. If all egg and sperm factors in a given cycle were unfavorable, the probability of pregnancy estimated by the logistic model was 4%, whereas if all were favorable the probability of pregnancy in that cycle was 59%.\r"

Sixty percent and 56% of the 1-cell embryos reached the expanded blastocyst stage when cultured in media A and B, respectively. Eighty-four percent and 88% of 2-cell embryos reached the expanded blastocyst stage when cultured in media A and B, respectively. A prospective randomized study was then performed to evaluate this synthetic serum substitute in human in vitro fertilization. Among 141 ovum pick-up (OPU), oocytes retrieved in 74 cases were processed in medium A and oocytes retrieved in 67 others in medium B. In media A and B, the fertilization rate was 67% and 44.3% respectively, and the pregnancy rate/OPU 23% and 9%, respectively. The pregnancy rate/transfer was 28.8% and 12.2% respectively, and the implantation rate/transferred embryo 9.5% and 4.2%. In the human sperm survival assay, the vitality and residual motility after 24 hours of incubation were significantly lower in medium B. In conclusion, UltroSer G successfully sustained the development in vitro of mouse embyros. However in human, it reduced sperm survival, oocyte fertilization, and embryo viability.\r"

The response of these patients to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation, oocyte capture, fertilization, cleavage, and pregnancy was studied. Patients with cystic change had significantly lower peak estradiol (E2) levels. Pregnancy rates were lower, but not significantly so. Those patients with structures 16 to 29 mm had more cycles canceled due to precipitous drops in E2, consistent with an untimely surge of luteinizing hormone. Patients with structures 30 to 60 mm had increased numbers of cycles with poor response to stimulation. The importance of an early follicular phase ultrasound scan is stressed, and the management of ovarian cysts in this patient population is discussed.\r"

An improvement was observed after changing to 5-ASA in those with poor (n = 3), but not in those with normal (n = 3), sperm function on sulfasalazine. There was no correlation between reactive oxygen species production or acetylator phenotype with egg penetration capacity, sperm motility, or sperm density. We conclude that the mechanism of impairment and recovery of sperm function on and off sulfasalazine treatment is not related to an excess in reactive oxygen species.\r"

We examined symptoms and oesophageal motor patterns in response to eating bread in 30 patients with either gastro-oesophageal reflux (n = 20), or normal oesophageal function tests (n = 10). No patient experienced symptoms while swallowing water but one complained of heartburn and one developed symptomatic oesophageal 'spasm' during eating. In eight further patients, pain or dysphagia which occurred with swallowing bread was associated with aperistalsis. Comparing asymptomatic and symptomatic periods, there was a slight increase in mean swallow frequency from 7.5 (0.79) (SEM) to 9.0 (1.17) swallows per minute (NS; n = 10). The mean number of aperistalsis swallows increased from 4.5 (0.96) per minute to 6.2 (1.30) (p less than 0.01; n = 10). Aperistalsis during symptoms was mainly caused by non-conducted swallows rather than synchronous contractions (mean 5.8 (1.45) per minute compared with 1.2 (0.44]. Aperistalsis can be produced by rapid swallowing in the normal oesophagus through 'deglutitive inhibition'. These results suggest that some patients experience dysphagia associated with aperistalsis perhaps as a response to increased frequency of swallowing. Functional abnormalities of this nature will not be detected by conventional oesophageal manometry.\r"

It is present in large concentrations in saliva and duodenal contents but the mechanisms of its release have been little studied. This study carried out on four groups of healthy subjects was designed to determine the distribution and the release of immunoreactive EGF (IR-EGF) in salivary, gastric, duodenal, and pancreatic secretions. Under basal conditions, the concentrations of IR-EGF in salivary, gastric, duodenal and pancreatic secretions were; 2.7 (0.4), 0.42 (0.12), 21 (5) and 8.5 (1.2) ng/ml, respectively. Chewing of Parafilm* significantly increased salivary but not gastric or duodenal EGF output while atropinisation led to the reduction in basal salivary and duodenal EGF output without affecting the increment in EGF release induced by chewing. Cigarette smoking caused a marked reduction in basal salivary and duodenal EGF output. Infusion of pentagastrin increased salivary and duodenal EGF output and this was blocked by the addition of somatostatin. Injection of secretin lead to an increase in pancreatic output of EGF. We conclude that in man the major sources of EGF are salivary glands, duodenum, and pancreas and that the release of EGF remains under neurohormonal control.\r"

There was no relationship between a preference for hotter drinks with either the sex or smoking habits of the patient. In the control group the temperature of choice tended to decrease with age though linear regression just failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.06); this trend was not apparent in the disease group (p = 0.64).

The primary G lamblia infection induced a transient reduction in disaccharidase activity which was related to the highest trophozoite burden in the small intestine. During the primary exposure, a 30% to 85% decrease in the activity of enzymes was observed on days 10 and 20 after infection. Secondary exposure of gerbils to G lamblia caused a sharp decrease in disaccharidase activity as early as 24 h after challenge. The reduction in the enzyme activity was not influenced by the size of the challenge inoculum and occurred even when there were no live trophozoites in the small intestine. Disaccharidase deficiency could also be induced by challenge with the soluble extract of the trophozoites. Multiple challenge administrations of G lamblia trophozoites to gerbils induced a persistent disaccharidase deficiency. The results indicate that disaccharidase deficiency associated with the primary G lamblia infection probably represents a direct effect of the parasite on the brush border of the small intestine. On the other hand, the observed disaccharidase deficiency in the secondary G lamblia infection appears to be induced by the local immune responses of the host.\r"

Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91%) and 18 children (100%) with coeliac disease and in 14 dermatitis herpetiformis patients with subtotal villous atrophy (reticulin antibodies 93% and endomysium antibodies 100%). The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies was high because all 45 adult patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 24 non-coeliac children with abdominal symptoms and 99/100 healthy blood donors were negative for these antibodies. The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies but also she was found to have coeliac disease. IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge. This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive enteropathy and to monitor dietary treatment. To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates. Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the endomysium antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus. These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes. The human subtype could not be separated from endomysium antibodies in the present absorption experiments.\r"

Anal sensation was impaired in the faecally incontinent patients. No difference was found between the groups as measured by pudendal nerve terminal motor latency.

Although Vivonex caused greater body weight gain, both essential fatty acids and saturated fatty acids increased small intestinal weight, mucosal weight, protein and DNA overall, and in each of three intestinal segments (proximal, middle and distal), compared with Vivonex.

Sucralfate can be labelled with 99mTc for the detection of oesophageal mucosal ulceration. This method uses two separate supine swallows of 10 MBq 99mTc-colloid in 10 ml, followed by a single supine swallow of 30 MBq 99mTc-sucralfate. The data are processed to give time-activity curves, mean transit times and condensed dynamic images. When oesophageal ulceration is detected, the time-activity curves using sucralfate show residual activity in the oesophagus after the transit time indicated by the colloid swallow. The condensed dynamic image shows a persistence of activity at the level of the ulceration. Erect sucralfate images taken immediately after the dynamic sequence show no oesophageal localisation. The results from a study of 62 patients have shown excellent correlation between the dynamic 99mTc-sucralfate images and endoscopy findings. Sequential sucralfate studies for healing also correlate well. The use of labelled sucralfate to detect oesophageal ulceration could modify the indications for endoscopy in gastrooesophageal reflux disease.\r"

Nodal deposits all expressed CEA and 45 of 49 expressed EMA (92%); 29 of 45 normal colon sections showed CEA expression (64%) as did all adenomas. EMA was not expressed by normal colon or adenomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increasing amounts of porcine secretion (0.05 to 2.00 clinical units/h/100 g body wt) given to rats during a continuous infusion of bilirubin, increased bile flow and the apparent maximal biliary excretion of bilirubin ('Tm'). This increment was caused by an enhanced biliary output of bilirubin monoconjugates. The effect was dose dependent but maximal at a secretin infusion of 0.80 CU. Somatostatin 0.2 and 0.8 microgram/h/100 g body wt caused a dose related inhibition of the hepatic effects of secretin both on bile flow and on biliary output of bilirubin conjugates. As secretin elicits the release of somatostatin, a feed-back system could be envisaged whereby the somatostatin released stops the effects of secretin.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol inhibits phospholipase (PL) activity in a number of animal models. We have therefore measured prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), liberated by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils respectively in chronic alcoholics and in control subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from alcoholics produced less PGE2 (p less than 0.01) and neutrophils produced less LTB4 (p less than 0.025). Reduced PGE2 production by PBMC of alcoholics was corrected by the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (p less than 0.005) whilst neutrophil LTB4 production remained lower in the alcoholics (p less than 0.01). Percutaneous liver biopsies were undertaken in the 20 alcoholics having abnormal liver function tests. Prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis was lower in PBMC from patients with alcoholic hepatitis than with alcoholic cirrhosis (p less than 0.05). Analysis of PBMC fatty acid composition demonstrated that endogenous arachidonate and linoleate contents were not significantly different in alcoholics and controls. Cells from controls and alcoholics were incubated with 0, 50 and 150 mmol/l ethanol for two hours but there was no alteration in PGE2 or LTB4 biosynthesis. In summary, we found reduced eicosanoid production by peripheral leucocytes in alcoholics, supporting the hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption either inhibits membrane bound phospholipase activity or enhances, alternatively, catabolism of eicosanoids. This phenomenon is more marked in alcoholic patients with hepatitis than in those with cirrhosis alone.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of oxidoreduction of deoxycholic acid in the enterohepatic circulation was studied in seven healthy subjects and seven patients after cholecystectomy. (12 beta-3H) Deoxycholic acid was given orally together with (24-14C) labelled bile acid. The rate of oxidoreduction of the 12 alpha-hydroxyl group of deoxycholic acid was calculated from the decay in ratio between 3H and 14C. In spite of a normal proportion of deoxycholic acid and other secondary bile acids in bile, patients after cholecystectomy had more than two-fold higher degree of oxidoreduction of the 12 alpha-hydroxyl group than healthy controls. The high extent of oxidoreduction is probably because of an increased exposure of the bile acid pool to intestinal bacteria and may have physiological implications.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of meal volume and luminal digestion of carbohydrates on the release of pancreatic polypeptide (HPP) were investigated in eight healthy subjects and in six patients who had non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. On one occasion each subject ingested a placebo with 200 ml water and a starch (50 g) pudding meal (400 ml) 30 minutes later. On another occasion an amylase inhibitor that retards intraluminal starch digestion was given with the water and starch. In normal subjects, water caused a moderate rise in HPP plasma levels (16.9 (10.9) pg/ml; p less than 0.02) and ingestion of starch increased HPP in a double peaked pattern. The mean increments of the peaks were 45.0 (15.2) pg/ml (p less than 0.02) and 41.1 (17.3) pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. In the diabetic subjects, the HPP concentrations did not increase in response to water. After ingestion of starch the diabetics had two peaks of HPP that were similar in magnitude, but the early postprandial peak was delayed significantly compared to normal subjects (37.5 (5.1) min v 23.4 (3.9) min; p less than 0.05). The amylase inhibitor (5 or 10 g) reduced the early postprandial HPP peak by 79% (p less than 0.05) in normal subjects and 4 g of the inhibitor reduced the early HPP peak by 58% (p less than 0.05) in the diabetics. In both groups ingestion of the amylase inhibitor abolished the late HPP peak (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, carbohydrate induced HPP release is dependent on undisturbed intraluminal starch digestion.\r"
