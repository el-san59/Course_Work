A group of eyes dressed with a petroleum jelly mesh, gauze pad, and cartella shield were compared with a group dressed only with a cartella shield. Study of the eyes and lids before and after operation, including the taking of lid margin and fornix swabs for culture, suggested that there was no significant difference in the bacterial presence between the two groups. The eyes dressed with a cartella shield alone appeared less prone to discharge. The relative merits of different types of dressing are discussed.\r"

The average interval between cataract extraction with lens implantation and the appearance of bullous keratopathy was five and a half years (range 10 months to 16 years). The mean follow-up period after penetrating keratoplasty was 36 months (range 12 to 56 months). The corneal graft remained clear in 22 (76%) eyes. One year after the operation 45% of the eyes had a vision of 20/40 or better, and 20% had visual acuities between 20/40 and 20/100. The remaining 31% had a vision of 20/100 or less (one unknown). Nine eyes (31%) had cystoid macular oedema or macular degeneration. 45% of the eyes had a refraction within approximately 2 dioptres of emmetropia. In patients with pseudophakic corneal oedema we continue to exchange the intraocular lens by a Pearce tripod posterior chamber lens sutured to the iris when it is necessary to remove the lens.\r"

Changes in axial length were found to be too small to produce errors in calculation.

  ".W": "This paper describes the ophthalmological features of 150 patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis, 67 of whom had isolated retinal vasculitis (RV) and 83 had RV associated with systemic inflammatory disease (RV + SID). The diagnosis of retinal vasculitis was made by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography, and patients with any identifiable cause (infection, ischaemia, or malignancy) were excluded from the study. Patients with isolated RV tended to have peripheral vascular sheathing, macular oedema, and diffuse capillary leakage. Those with RV accompanying Behcet's disease often had branch vein retinal occlusions and retinal infiltrates together with macular oedema and diffuse capillary leakage; the retinal infiltrates were pathognomonic for Behcet's disease. In sarcoidosis the retina typically showed features of periphlebitis associated with focal vascular leakage. Patients with uveomeningitis, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, or systemic vasculitis showed diffuse retinal capillary leakage associated with a mixture of the other features. Poor visual function was particularly associated with macular oedema and branch vein retinal occlusion, while the retina appeared to 'withstand' the impact of vascular sheathing, periphlebitis, or neovascularisation alone. Within the limitations of a point prevalence study it was concluded that different patterns of retinal vasculitis occur in different systemic inflammatory diseases, and that in isolated retinal vasculitis there is a particular association between peripheral vascular sheathing, macular oedema, and diffuse capillary leakage. In Part 2 we describe the results of examining the sera of these patients for the presence of antiretinal antibodies and circulating immune complexes.\r"

Antiretinal antibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence and passive haemagglutination, and circulating immune complexes were measured by polyethylene glycol precipitation and Clq binding. The occurrence of antiretinal antibodies and that of circulating immune complexes were analysed in relation to each other, to severity of retinal disease, to the type of associated systemic inflammatory disease, and to the presence of individual features of retinal inflammation. In patients with retinal vasculitis together with systemic inflammatory disease circulating immune complexes were usually accompanied by antiretinal antibodies. However, those patients with antiretinal antibodies in the absence of circulating immune complexes tended to have more severe retinal vasculitis, a feature particularly evident in Behcet's disease (p = 0.028). In patients with isolated retinal vasculitis, severity of disease was associated with antiretinal antibody (p = 0.013), as well as with the occurrence of both antiretinal antibody and circulating immune complexes together (p = 0.010). In the series as a whole there was a tendency for individual features of retinal vasculitis to be associated with antiretinal antibodies unaccompanied by circulating immune complexes; especially in macular oedema (p = 0.028).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This number represents a significant increase on the previous incidence of this serious complication, which may be related to more widespread use of vitrectomy techniques. Orbital and local lymph node recurrence of retinoblastoma have been associated with a very poor survival rate in the past, and steps must be taken to limit the chance of this happening should an intraocular surgical procedure be performed inadvertently on an eye containing a retinoblastoma. Early enucleation without implant is advised, and adjuvant orbital radiotherapy is strongly recommended, even when there is no histopathological evidence of local extraocular tumour spread.\r"

Of nine litter mates five had nyctalopia. The results of different clinical tests, including electroretinography (ERG), were compared with the results found in four human cases of CSNB, three of which were most probably associated with autosomal recessive inheritance and one with X-linked inheritance. The congenital and stationary nature of the disease, ophthalmoscopically normal appearing fundi, and recordable but reduced photopic flicker responses were some of the similarities found between canine and human cases. The single-flash ERG response was abnormal in the humans as well as in the affected Briards. However, the human cases showed a \"negative' ERG, whereas in the Briards both the a and b waves were extremely reduced and present only at a photopic level. Cases similar to these Briards have been described also in man, where rhodopsin concentration and regeneration were found to be normal, suggesting a disturbed transduction mechanism. It thus appears that the Briard dog may become a valuable model of human CSNB.\r"

Its effect appears to be mediated at least in part by NO stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. We evaluated the role of this pathway in two PMN effector functions: cell movement and microbial killing, using the competitive inhibitor of L-arginine conversion to NO, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA). We also evaluated the effect of additional L-arginine and dibutyryl cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) on any NMA-associated changes. Human peripheral blood neutrophils were used and the cells were incubated with and without NMA. Chemotaxis was evaluated using a 48-well micro-Boyden chamber. Microbial killing was evaluated using S aureus strains D2C and 502A. These studies demonstrated that chemotaxis to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine was markedly inhibited in NMA-treated cells. This inhibition could be overcome if L-arginine or dibutyryl cGMP were added with the NMA. In contrast, microbial killing of S aureus was unaffected by NMA. These observations support the hypothesis that the L-arginine metabolism to NO and its effect on the cGMP level may be important for the dynamic changes required for neutrophil chemotaxis.\r"

The rise in platelet count occurred following completion of the short course of IFN in 10 patients and occurred during therapy in one patient. Three patients showed an increase to normal platelet counts within 14 days of discontinuing the drug, eight showed a partial response, with a platelet count increase from 30 to 100 x 10(9)/L, and two patients showed minimal response. One complete responder relapsed at 5 months from initial response, and a further course of alpha 2b IFN caused a second prompt response with a rise of platelet count to supranormal levels. Short-course alpha 2b IFN can be recommended as a therapy for severe ITP. Responses are seen in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized subjects, and thrombocytopenia is not exacerbated during treatment.\r"

Disease-free survival (DFS) following myeloablative therapy and ABMT has been shown to be superior to conventional treatment in high risk patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It was the purpose of the present study to compare hematopoietic reconstitution, actuarial DFS, and relapse rate of patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR) of AML with those in second or subsequent CR, and to evaluate transplant related mortality. Fifty-two patients with AML, 22 in first CR (low risk) and 30 in second or subsequent CR (high risk), underwent total body irradiation (12.1 to 16.7 Gy) and cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment (200 mg/kg) followed by ABMT. The autograft was incubated with the active CY derivative Mafosfamide (ASTA Werke, Bielefeld, Federal Republic of Germany) to reduce the number of possibly contaminating clonogenic tumor cells. All patients showed three lineage engraftments with platelet recovery observed as being the slowest. The transplant related death rate was low at 5.8%. There was no significant difference in the kinetics of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell or platelet reconstitution between the low and high risk patient subgroups. The estimated probability of DFS (relapse) after ABMT in first CR was 61% (36%) compared with 34% (65%) in second or subsequent CR, the longest follow-up being 55 months and 57 months, respectively (median follow-up 31 months and 19 months, respectively). ABMT offers a stable long-term DFS when performed in first CR with no relapses occurring in over a year after transplantation. Six later relapses, however, were seen after ABMT in second or subsequent CR, although DFS was not statistically different from that of first remission patients (P = .72).\r"

  ".W": "We used a helper-free recombinant retrovirus carrying the neomycin resistance (neor) gene to investigate methods for improving gene transfer efficiencies to clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells of human origin and to assess the possibility of gene transfer to the more primitive cells from which clonogenic cells are derived after several weeks in long-term human marrow cultures. The proportion of neor CFU-GM in methylcellulose assays of infected fresh marrow was increased by six- to eightfold (mean 37.4%) by the addition of extra GM colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-1 beta or medium conditioned by a human marrow \"stromal\" cell line to medium conditioned by agar-stimulated human leukocytes both during the infection and the colony growth period. Similar increases were also noted in the proportion of neor BFU-E, although the efficiencies overall were somewhat lower (up to 25.7%, mean 16.3%). Initiation of long-term cultures with marrow exposed to virus under the same growth factor-supplemented conditions but without any immediate selection step resulted in sustained production of a high proportion of neor CFU-GM and BFU-E for 6 weeks in both the nonadherent and adherent fractions. Molecular analysis was used to confirm the presence of the neo gene after culture. These results demonstrate that stable, high-efficiency gene transfer can be accomplished to the most primitive class of human hematopoietic cells currently detectable that may also have in vivo reconstituting potential. Further use of this approach should provide new insights into human hematopoietic stem cell regulation and allow continued development and assessment of gene therapy procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow cytotoxicity of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), an anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) drug, has been attributed to deoxyribonucleotide pool perturbations that might result in impaired DNA synthesis in normal bone marrow elements. We examined, in vitro, the effect of high, but clinically achievable and nontoxic, concentrations of 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd) (greater than or equal to 100 mumol/L) on high-dose AZT mediated growth inhibition and intracellular biochemical perturbations in normal bone marrow progenitor cells. Colony formation by bone marrow progenitor cells in semisolid medium was significantly protected by dCyd against the inhibitory effects of co-administered, high concentrations of AZT (10 mumol/L). Also, dCyd significantly corrected AZT mediated depletion of intracellular thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and dCyd triphosphate (dCTP) levels in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC). Moreover, dCyd reduced the intracellular accumulation of AZT triphosphate (AZT-TP) and its DNA incorporation in BMMC. In contrast, co-administration of dCyd (100 mumol/L to 1 mmol/L) did not reverse AZT (10 mumol/L) mediated suppression of HIV infectivity in HUT-102 cells in culture, although a partial reduction in intracellular AZT-TP pools and its DNA incorporation as well as a correction of AZT mediated depletion of dTTP and dCTP pools was observed in these cells. These studies suggest that dCyd at high concentrations might ameliorate the bone marrow cytotoxicity of high-dose AZT without impairing its anti-HIV effect.\r"

  ".W": "Using a clonal culture system, we investigated the lymphohematopoietic effects of recombinant interleukin-7 (IL-7) obtained from conditioned media of transfected COS 1 cells. IL-7 alone acted on murine bone marrow cells and supported the formation of B-cell colonies. These colony cells were positive for B220, and some of them were also found to have either IgM or Thy-1. B220+, IgM- cells, but not B220- cells sorted from fresh bone marrow cells were able to form B cell colonies in the presence of IL-7. Thus, IL-7 supported the differentiation of B220+, IgM- cells to B220+, IgM+ cells. B220+, IgM+ cells did not proliferate in the presence of IL-7. IL-7 did not affect the myeloid colony formation supported by IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and G-CSF. On the other hand, lymphocyte colony formation was not affected by IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, or G-CSF. Interestingly, IL-1 alpha inhibited IL-7-induced B cell colony formation in a dose-dependent manner, while the same concentration of IL-1 alpha enhanced the myeloid colony formation by IL-3. This reciprocal effect of IL-1 alpha may act on hematopoietic progenitor cells without accessory cells. These data show that IL-7 is a B cell growth factor and that IL-1 alpha may play an important role in differentiation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages.\r"

Infusion of NaB increased F reticulocytes and F-positive CFUe and e-cluster colonies without induction of reticulocytosis or increase in progenitor cell numbers. Addition of NaB in bone marrow cultures increased the frequency of F-positive CFUe and e-clusters without increasing progenitor cell numbers. NaB induced HbF in human adult BFUe cultures and increased the gamma/gamma + beta globin chain and mRNA ratios in short-term incubations of culture-derived erythroblasts. There was a synergistic induction of HbF by NaB and 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), but not when the animal was treated with NaB and cytarabine (AraC). Our results suggest that the activation of gamma-globin expression by NaB reflects an action of this compound on globin genes or globin chromatin.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the movement of fibrinogen-gold (fgn-Au) complexes in platelets activated in suspension and by surface contact. Fgn-Au probes did not react with resting cells but were bound to the external membrane of platelets in suspension 5 seconds after addition of 1 U/mL of thrombin. At intervals over a period of 5 to 20 minutes, fgn-Au probes moved from the cell surface to peripheral and then deep channels of the open canalicular system (OCS). When platelets were surface activated by exposure to carbon-stabilized, formvar-coated grids for 5 to 20 minutes and then exposed to fgn-Au complexes for 5 minutes, probes were also observed in the OCS. At 5 minutes, over 40% of the platelets had concentrated fgn-Au in their OCS. Results after 10 minutes revealed 25% with gold-filled channels, 16% after 15 minutes, and 5% after 20 minutes. The decrease in frequency of OCS staining correlated with the increasing frequency of spread platelets, suggesting that tension produced by spreading may cause collapse of the OCS or that the OCS may evaginate onto the platelet during spreading. To evaluate the latter hypothesis, platelets were initially exposed to grids for 5 minutes and then incubated with fgn-Au for intervals of 5 to 20 minutes. The frequency of platelets with fgn-Au concentrated in the OCS was greatest at 5 minutes (44%) and decreased at the same rate as the frequency of spread platelets increased. Only 14.7% of the cells contained fgn-Au in the OCS after 20 minutes. These were primarily dendritic in form, while fully spread platelets rarely contained an OCS filled with the probe. The study indicates that fgn-Au particles are cleared to channels of the OCS independent of the mechanism of platelet activation. Fgn-Au that has been concentrated in the OCS at early stages of surface activation can be externalized during platelet spreading but remain internalized in suspension-activated cells. The OCS represents a membrane reservoir that can be evaginated onto the platelet surface during interaction with surfaces.\r"

We report here the results of a clinical study undertaken to test the consistency of responses to repeated DDAVP administrations in 22 patients with vWD and 10 with mild or moderate hemophilia A (time interval between first and last infusion ranging from 1 to 77 months; median, 13 months). In patients with vWD, 80% of cases showed a departure of less than 20% from the average VIII:C peak level calculated after the two infusions. A similarly consistent pattern was observed for bleeding times recorded 30 minutes after each infusion. In patients with hemophilia A, some infused on more than two instances, the departure from the average VIII:C peak level was less than 20% in nearly 70% of cases. A good within-family consistency was also demonstrated by analyzing data obtained from seven kindreds with vWD and two with hemophilia A. In conclusion, our study suggests that the pattern of responsiveness observed after a DDAVP test-infusion can be reliably used to decide the future clinical management of the individual patient and that a similar pattern of response is usually observed within the same kindred.\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the fragment that is liberated from factor X when this zymogen is activated by factor VII/VIIa-tissue factor or factor IXa was developed. Antisera were raised in rabbits to a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide containing the COOH-terminal sequence of the activation fragment coupled to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. The reactivity of the antibody population obtained toward the factor X zymogen was negligible (less than 1/36,000 that of the activation peptide on a molar basis). However, because other plasma constituents contributed to a nonspecific basal signal in the RIA, a procedure by which the peptide could be reproducibly extracted from plasma was developed. The mean level of this species in normal individuals younger than the age of 40 was 66.4 pmol/L, and elevations up to 550 pmol/L were observed in patients with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The validity of these measurements of factor X activation is supported by the fact that the RIA signal migrates on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in a manner identical to that of the native peptide and can be quantitatively recovered. The mean concentration of the activation fragment was markedly decreased to 25.7 pmol/L in patients with hereditary factor VII deficiency (P = .0001 v normal controls), whereas the mean level in subjects with factor VIII deficiency was 61.1 pmol/L (P greater than .1 v normal controls). These data indicate that the basal (ie, in the absence of thrombosis or provocative stimuli) levels of FXP under in vivo conditions result mainly from the activity of the extrinsic pathway.\r"

  ".U": "90028726\r", 
  ".W": "Platelets contain a pool of endogenous platelet-von Willebrand factor (vWF) that becomes expressed on the platelet surface when platelets are stimulated by a variety of agonists. Maximal platelet-vWF expression occurs in concert with platelet alpha-granule secretion. Aspirin (ASA) is known to impair platelet activation and alpha-granule secretion by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclo-oxygenase. We studied native and ASA-treated platelets for their ability to mobilize and to express platelet-vWF in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or thrombin. We found that each agonist was effective in promoting increased platelet-vWF surface expression on native and ASA-treated platelets. ASA-treated platelets responded identically to native platelets to low (0.01 U/mL) and high (1.0 U/mL) concentrations of thrombin, while the ADP-induced increase in ASA-treated platelets was only 50% to 60% of that for control platelets. Measurement of secreted platelet-vWF and beta-thromboglobulin indicated that the increase seen with ADP was largely independent of alpha-granule secretion. Using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa and Ib (MoAbs 10E5 and 6D1, respectively), we demonstrated that the ADP-induced increase in platelet-vWF expression on control platelets primarily involved the binding of secreted platelet-vWF to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa. In contrast, the increase in platelet-vWF that occurred following ADP stimulation of ASA-treated platelets was largely insensitive to GPIIb/IIIa blockade. No effect of GPIb blockade in platelet-vWf expression was noted for either control or ASA-treated platelets. When platelet shape change was prevented by the addition of cytochalasin D, ADP-induced platelet-vWf surface expression on ASA-treated platelets was reduced by more than 80%. Our data indicate that platelets in which the cyclooxygenase pathway is blocked by the action of aspirin can increase surface expression of platelet-vWf as a consequence of platelet shape change. We speculate that this process exposes platelet-vWf bound to GPIIb/IIIa, or possibly GPIb, within the surface connected canalicular system.\r"

We report here on the identification of two integrins on the surface of human platelets that bind to thrombospondin. When platelet membrane proteins are radiolabeled with 125I-lactoperoxidase, solubilized in n-octylglucoside, (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and applied to a column of thrombospondin-Sepharose, both complexes are bound to the column and specifically eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. One of these integrins, glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, appears to bind relatively weakly. The second integrin shares the same beta subunit (beta 3 or GPIIIa), but has a distinct alpha subunit that comigrates with the alpha subunit (alpha v) of the vitronectin receptor (VnR) on endothelial cells and reacts with a monoclonal antibody, LM142, which was raised against an integrin from M21 melanoma cells. The alpha v beta 3 integrin is present on a variety of cell types and appears to act as a receptor for thrombospondin on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. On endothelial and M21 melanoma cells this receptor is also involved in adhesion to fibrinogen, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The alpha v beta 3 integrin is present at approximately equal levels on normal and thrombasthenic platelets, whereas levels of GPIIb-IIIa are greatly reduced on thrombasthenic platelets. The alpha v beta 3 integrin on thrombasthenic platelets also binds to thrombospondin-Sepharose and can be eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. These data indicate that the alpha v beta 3 integrin on platelets, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells functions as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent receptor for thrombospondin.\r"

Spontaneous platelet aggregation is observed when citrated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is stirred in an aggregometer cuvette. This aggregation is completely is only slightly diminished by an antiglycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa or by an anti GPIb monoclonal antibody. The patient's PRP shows increased sensitivity to ristocetin. The distinct feature of this patient, also present in two family members studied, is that platelet aggregation is initiated by purified vWF in the absence of any other agonist. The vWF-induced platelet aggregation is abolished by anti-GPIb and anti-GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibodies and by EDTA (5 mmol/L). Apyrase inhibits the second wave of aggregation. Patient's platelets in PRP are four to six times more reactive to asialo vWF-induced platelet aggregation than normal platelets. The amount of radiolabeled vWF bound to platelets in the presence of either low concentration of ristocetin or asialo vWF was increased 30% compared with normal. The patient's platelet GPIb was analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting and by binding studies with anti-GPIb monoclonal antibodies showed one band with slightly increased migration pattern and a normal number of GPIb molecules. Unlike the previously reported patients with pseudo or platelet-type von Willebrand disease, this patient has normal vWF parameters.\r"

In this study, the capacity of human thymocytes for nucleoside transport was assessed both by cytosine arabinoside influx and by equilibrium binding of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR), a specific ligand for the equilibrative nucleoside transporter of leukocytes. The proportion of freshly isolated thymocytes synthesizing DNA was 8.6% +/- 2.1% (n = 12) by 3H-thymidine labeling index and 7.8% +/- 2.9% (n = 4) S-phase cells by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. In comparison, both methods gave proliferation S-phase values less than 1% for peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Thymocytes expressed a high density of specific NBMPR binding sites (26,068 +/- 8,776 sites per cell, n = 12) as compared with PBLs (1,123 +/- 553 sites per cell, n = 8). The initial influx of cytosine arabinoside into thymocytes was 14-fold greater than into PBLs, and in both cell types the influx of nucleoside was totally inhibited by 0.5 mumol/L NBMPR, which is known to inhibit the major equilibrative nucleoside transporter in white blood cells. Depletion of mature CD3+ cells from the thymocyte preparation by anti-CD3 antibody left a residual population with both increased labeling index and up to twofold greater density of NBMPR binding sites. When PBLs were cultured for 48 hours with the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin, a 40-fold increase in labeling index was observed, together with a 30-fold increase in the density of specific NBMPR binding sites. Thus, fresh thymocytes from human thymus are actively proliferating and express high densities of a functional nucleoside transporter. The more immature cells in the thymocyte population which are proliferating more actively have a greater density of nucleoside transporters than the whole population. In contrast, mitotically inactive PBLs-have few nucleoside transporters, but after mitogenic stimulation PBLs express large numbers of this transmembrane molecule.\r"

Both kappa and lambda light-chain genes were rearranged in the blood, suggesting peripheral blood lymphocyte involvement in the myeloma. Analysis of the Ig genes after chemotherapy demonstrated no change in the JH or CK rearrangements; however, the lambda genes were now in a germline configuration.

The rate of ara-CTP accumulation after in vitro ara-C incubation was compared in lymphocytes obtained prior to therapy without any other manipulation, after ex vivo F-ara-ATP (100 mumol/L) treatment, and after in vivo F-ara-A monophosphate therapy. Lymphocytes showed a 2.2-fold (n = 23) and 1.7-fold (n = 23) median increase in the cellular concentration of ara-CTP after an ex vivo incubation with 100 mumol/L F-ara-A and 20 to 24 hours after the first dose (25 or 30 mg/m2) of F-ara-A monophosphate in vivo treatment, respectively. Although the rates of F-ara-ATP and ara-CTP accumulation varied among patients, a relationship was observed in individuals between the cellular concentration of F-ara-ATP at the beginning of the ara-C incubation and ara-CTP accumulation. These studies strongly suggest that a protocol designed to administer F-ara-A monophosphate prior to ara-C infusion will augment ara-CTP accumulation by leukemia cells.\r"

Using a sensitive bioassay for IL-6, the capacity of the leukemic cells of 30 patients with AML to produce IL-6 was examined. IL-6 production was found to be specific for cells from patients with an AML with monocytic differentiation (12 of 15 M4 and M5 patients, 0 of 15 M1 and M2 patients). Moreover, IL-6 production was paralleled by IL-1 production. The IL-6- and IL-1-producing cells were mainly found in the more mature monocytic cell fractions, defined as CD14-positive and CD34-negative adherent cells. By limiting dilution experiments, it could be excluded that the production of IL-1 or IL-6 was due to contamination with normal monocytes.\r"

As a first step, we synthesized several oligonucleotide probes and isolated cDNA clones for the MPO gene. MPO expression was detected in most acute myeloid leukemias, and the level of expression correlated well with cytochemical enzymatic activity. No MPO message was detected in pure lymphoid leukemias, whereas very low basal levels of MPO transcripts were found in normal bone marrows. In four cases of acute undifferentiated leukemias cytochemically negative for MPO, significant levels of MPO transcripts were detected, suggesting a myeloid origin for these cases. These results indicate that MPO gene expression may serve as an additional marker for subclassification of acute leukemias and may be used to identify leukemic cells arrested at an early stage of the myeloid differentiation pathway.\r"

Colonies of leukemic cells were obtained in 18 of 20 cases after 1 week in culture in a liquid layer containing recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and B-cell growth factor over an agar feeder layer containing irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells plus fetal calf serum (FCS) and horse serum. Cultured cells expressed HLA-DR, CD-9, CD-10, CD-20, and CD-34 antigens, indicating conservation of precursor B phenotype. Differentiation antigen expression on the clonogenic subpopulation giving rise to leukemic colonies was assessed by treating cells prior to culture with selected cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Lytic treatment with HLA-DR, CD-10, CD-9, and CD-20 antibodies produced median reductions in colony formation of 93%, 81%, 73%, and 58% respectively. Combined treatment with CD-9 and CD-10 antibodies produced complete inhibition in 11 of 13 cases. Cell-sorting experiments after CD-10 staining indicated a good correlation with complement lysis studies and also demonstrated that the CD-19 antigen is expressed on a high proportion of clonogenic cells. Colony formation was also significantly reduced in 13 of 17 cases by lytic treatment of cells with the CD-33 antibody MY-9, suggesting expression of this \"myeloid\" lineage antigen on ALL clonogenic cells. The substantial case-to-case variation in expression of individual differentiation antigens indicates that leukemic cellular heterogeneity is a major consideration in ex vivo bone marrow purging using MoAbs and emphasizes the need for more critical evaluation of purging techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of lymphoid infiltrates of the orbit and conjunctiva is poorly understood. To determine if immunohistologic features could predict clinical outcome, these features were evaluated in 61 patients with orbital and conjunctival lymphoid infiltrates, including 44 patients with lesions localized to one or both orbits or conjunctivae. Using histologic criteria, 20 infiltrates were classified as malignant lymphoma (cytologically atypical), 14 cases were classified as benign (follicular hyperplasia or inflammatory pseudotumor), and 27 infiltrates (44%) were dense infiltrates of small lymphocytes without cytologic atypia, which could not be confidently classified as benign or malignant (histologically indeterminate). Based on expression of monotypic immunoglobulin, 20 of these cases were reclassified as small lymphocytic lymphoma. For all cases, monotypic immunoglobulin expression correlated with reduced survival (P less than .05) and increased likelihood of dissemination (P less than .001). Monotypic immunoglobulin expression also correlated with increased risk of dissemination for all histologically indeterminate (small lymphocytic) infiltrates (P less than .05). Separate analysis of the localized infiltrates showed that monotypic immunoglobulin expression significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of dissemination for all 44 cases (P less than .005) and for the 22 histologically indeterminate lesions (P = .06). For the localized small lymphocytic infiltrates, monotypic immunoglobulin expression conferred a 50% risk of dissemination. In contrast, no patients with polytypic small lymphocytic infiltrates have disseminated, although one lesion locally recurred 30 months later as lymphoma. Thus, monotypic immunoglobulin expression significantly correlates with reduced patient survival and increased risk of dissemination by orbital and conjunctival lymphoid infiltrates. Monotypic small lymphocytic infiltrates without cytologic atypia behave as do low grade B-cell malignant lymphomas with a significant risk of dissemination and an indolent clinical course. The relationship of polytypic small lymphocytic infiltrates to lymphoma remains to be determined.\r"

These children were assigned to six mutually exclusive cytogenetic categories as follows: (1) hyperdiploid, with 50 or more chromosomes (n = 35); (2) hyperdiploid, with 47 to 49 chromosomes (n = 11); (3) diploid (n = 42); (4) pseudodiploid (n = 34); (5) hypodiploid (n = 9); and (6) insufficient data (n = 34). At a median follow-up of 5 years, there were no statistically significant differences between any of these cytogenetic categories in either event-free or overall survival. Those children with chromosomal translocations (n = 26) appeared to fare the same as those lacking translocations (n = 105). The absence of karyotypic prognostic significance was observed not only within the overall group, but also when the results were stratified by standard-risk and high-risk status. Of the specific structural chromosome changes that we studied, only the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) appeared to confer a poor prognosis, although there were too few such cases to achieve statistical significance. Although we did not detect the event-free survival differences that have been described previously in hyperdiploid, hypodiploid, and pseudodiploid childhood ALL, our findings must be viewed as preliminary given the small number of children in some of the cytogenetic categories. We think that the prognostic implications of these cytogenetic features might have been nullified by improvements in therapy.\r"

An analogous structure was recently described in platelets. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were examined for the presence and plasma membrane association of similar proteins. Isolated PMNs, free of contamination with erythrocytes or platelets, were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and separated into subcellular organelles on a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Detergent lysates of plasma membrane vesicles, but not azurophilic or specific granules, contained insoluble actin filaments and associated proteins. Immunoblots of detergent-insoluble plasma membrane fractions contained proteins recognized by antibodies to brain fodrin and erythrocyte band 4.1, whereas blots probed with antibodies to erythrocyte spectrin and ankyrin were negative. Fodrin and band 4.1 were not detected in granule fractions, but some fodrin was present in the cytosol. The association of proteins related to fodrin and band 4.1 with the plasma membrane suggests that PMNs contain a submembranous skeleton structurally analogous to that of erythrocytes and platelets. The specific function of these proteins and their structural organization in human PMNs await further study.\r"

They originate from circulating monocytes (MO) as immature precursor cells that undergo terminal differentiation upon migration from the capillary bed into the various tissues. In the presence of serum, MAC maturation from blood MO is observed in vitro and can be followed by the expression of maturation-associated antigens (MAX.1, .3, .11, and .26; transferrin receptor, 13C2, CD16). We have tested blood MO from 22 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) for their capacity to undergo terminal maturation in vitro. After isolation, blood MO in six patients expressed CD14 molecules at low density when compared to normals. On culture for 7 days, in 15 patients various abnormalities could be shown by phenotype analysis using cell-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunoperoxidase staining technique of single cells. Abnormalities ranged from the distinctive failure of mature MAC to express single surface antigens (eg, gp64-MAX.1) to complete inhibition of the development of a MAC maturation-associated phenotype. In three patients the maturational defect was found to persist in complete remission after successful therapy with antileukocyte globulin (ALG). Neither in other immunosuppressed or multiple-transfused patients nor in those with bone marrow hypoplasia secondary to cancer chemotherapy and during hematologic reconstitution following autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), defective MO maturation in vitro was seen. Our data provide evidence for the existence of serious disorders within the MO-MAC lineage in patients with AA. This observation may either reflect the stem-cell defect or indicate a MAC involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

Older red blood cell (RBC) cohorts in these patients consistently exhibited significantly decreased activities of AMP deaminase (approximately 5% to 70% of normal control mean) in association with increased concentrations (up to threefold) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total adenine nucleotides. We postulate that the latter is a direct consequence of the former, since diminishing AMP deaminase activity in aging cells should reduce the drain on the adenine nucleotide pool imposed by irreversible deamination of AMP to inosine 5'-monophosphate. Consistent reductions in AMP deaminase activity indicate that this enzyme should also serve as a reliable marker of mean RBC age useful in diagnostic confirmation of transient erythroblastopenia. The observed increases in ATP and total adenine nucleotides in older RBCs require a reevaluation of the traditional view that age-related losses of these compounds mediate the ultimate demise of senescent erythrocytes. Similar alterations in the balance of degradative and salvage pathways in RBC nucleotide metabolism may also underlie certain cases of so-called \"high ATP syndrome.\"\r"

Because the probe is irreversibly bound in the lipids of the cell membrane; substantial numbers of dye molecules can be incorporated per cell and thus substantial signal to noise can be achieved. Although this technology can be used for all hematopoietic cells, these first findings are reported on red blood cells (RBCs) owing to the importance of the membrane to RBC function and integrity. We demonstrated that labeling 10% of the RBCs of a rabbit and reinjecting them into the animal makes possible the tracking of these cells at various times after injection. Furthermore, the labeling appears not to affect in vivo cell lifetime or cellular volume changes in response to hypotonic shock. The single cell fluorescence intensity of the labeled RBCs remains relatively constant for 60 days, and an immune response appears not to be generated against labeled cells. That labeled RBCs have lifetime kinetics in vivo, as shown in other studies, indicates that the membranes are functioning normally and are unaltered by the labeling technology. The technology we present is also applicable to white blood cells, bone marrow, and platelets.\r"

The DNA located immediately 3' to the deletion breakpoint was found to function as an enhancer element in gene transfer experiments and to be specifically hypomethylated in normal erythroid cells of both fetal and adult origin. This DNA also contains a long open reading frame encoding a polypeptide chain 292 amino acids in length. Therefore, in this form of HPFH (HPFH-1), the continued expression of gamma-globin genes in adult life may result from the inclusion of these genes within a new chromosomal domain that is potentially transcriptionally active in adult erythroid cells. The 3' breakpoint of another large deletion causing delta beta thalassemia rather than HPFH was also identified. This deletion (Spanish G gamma A gamma (delta beta) degrees thalassemia) is nearly identical in size and location to that of HPFH-1, but extends an additional 8.5 to 9 kb in the 3' direction, and therefore results in loss of the sequences near the 3' breakpoint of HPFH-1.

In normal subjects, absorption from each of these pools was inversely correlated with storage iron, as measured by the serum ferritin concentration. In patients with hemochromatosis, absorption of both forms of iron was far greater than would be predicted from the relationship between absorption and serum ferritin observed in normal volunteers. Nevertheless, there was still a modest but statistically significant reduction in absorption of nonheme iron with increasing serum ferritin. This relationship could not be demonstrated in the case of heme iron absorption. In heterozygotes, nonheme iron absorption from a hamburger meal containing no supplementary iron did not differ significantly from that observed in normal volunteers. However, when this meal was both modified to promote bioavailability and supplemented with iron, absorption of nonheme iron was significantly elevated. These studies confirm the presence of excessive nonheme iron absorption even from unfortified meals in patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and suggest in addition that they are particularly susceptible to iron loading from diets containing a high proportion of heme iron. Impaired regulation of nonheme iron absorption was also observed in heterozygous individuals, but a statistically significant abnormality was demonstrable only when the test meal contained a large highly bioavailable iron supplement.\r"

  ".W": "To define how excess unpaired alpha- and beta-globin chains in severe beta-thalassemia and severe alpha-thalassemia interacting with the membrane might alter cellular and membrane properties, we performed a series of biophysical and biochemical analyses on erythrocytes obtained from affected patients. Detailed analysis of cellular and membrane deformability characteristics showed that both forms of thalassemic erythrocytes have excess surface area in relation to cell volume and increased membrane dynamic rigidity. The deformability characteristics of thalassemic erythrocytes in hypertonic media differed significantly from that of normal erythrocytes of identical cell density. These findings suggest that dynamic rigidity of thalassemic erythrocytes is influenced not only by cytoplasmic viscosity determined by cell hemoglobin concentration but also by the extent and type of globin interacting with the membrane. In contrast to the above-noted similarities, major differences were noted in the mechanical stability of the alpha- and beta-thalassemic membranes and in their state of cell hydration. While the mechanical stability of alpha-thalassemic membranes was normal or marginally elevated, the stability of beta-thalassemic membranes was markedly decreased to half the normal value. Cell-density analysis showed that the alpha-thalassemic erythrocytes were uniformly less dense than normal, while beta-thalassemic erythrocytes had a broad-density distribution, with all populations having both lower and higher than normal density values, implying cellular dehydration in beta-thalassemia and not in alpha-thalassemia. Membrane-protein analysis revealed that excess globin chains were bound to the membrane skeletons of both alpha- and beta-thalassemic erythrocytes, with the highest amounts being found in membrane skeletons derived from erythrocytes of splenectomized individuals with beta-thalassemia intermedia. These data demonstrate that interaction of excess alpha- and beta-globin chains with membranes produces different cellular changes and suggest that the observed differences in the pathophysiology of alpha- and beta-thalassemias may be related to different cellular effects induced by the excess in beta- and alpha-globin chains.\r"

In contrast, the percentage of CD4+ T cells was reduced for at least 3 years, and the CD4:CD8 ratio reflected this imbalance. B-cell reconstitution was slightly prolonged, with normal percentage and absolute numbers of CD20+ B cells evident by 3 months. Although B cells returned by 3 months, in vitro assessment of B-cell function demonstrated impairment of proliferative responses to either anti-immunoglobulins bound to beads (anti-Ig), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or interleukin-2 (IL-2) for approximately 1 year and low molecular B-cell growth factor (BCGF) for approximately 2 or more years. Moreover, in vivo B-cell reconstitution demonstrated a more selective defect, with normal levels of immunoglobulin IgM returning at 6 months, IgG at 12 months, and IgA after 2 years. Despite normal numbers of B cells and relative normal levels of Ig early following ABMT, our in vitro data suggest an intrinsic defect in B-cell responsiveness. Moreover, these defects are similar to those observed following nonpurged autologous and allogeneic BMT, although the interval of immune impairment appears more prolonged.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed the development of lymphocytes and of the main immunological functions in 33 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency who survived at least 6 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Eighteen patients received HLA-identical BM and 15 received HLA-nonidentical BM. Development of immune functions occurred faster after HLA-identical BMT as full T- and B-lymphocyte-mediated responses were present at day 186 versus 505, respectively (P = .05). In addition, antibody responses remain completely or partially absent in 8 of 15 patients of the second group. Detection of antibody response after HLA-incompatible BMT correlated with engraftment of donor B cells in informative cases. In patients who received an HLA-nonidentical BMT after chemotherapy (6 of 15), development of immune functions occurred more rapidly and 6 of 6 had B-cell functions, including normal antibody production. Autoimmunity was not uncommon and was found after HLA-incompatible BMT (4 of 15) or after HLA-partially phenotypically identical BMT (2 of 3). Antibodies were in most cases specific for blood cells. Occurrence of autoimmunity correlates with poor B-cell functions and to a lesser extent with defective T-cell responses. This type of study may lead to definition of a more accurate strategy for performing BMT in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency.\r"

In each case pretransplant immunosuppression included 1,375 to 1,500 cGy hyperfractionated total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d x 2). No patient received immunosuppression prosttransplant for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Nineteen patients in this group experienced graft failure. The major factors associated with graft failure were transplants from male donors and the age of the patient (or donor). Among male recipients of male donor-derived grafts a low dose per kilogram of nucleated cells, progenitor cells (colony forming unit-GM) and T cells was also associated with graft failure. Additional irradiation to 1,500 cGy, high dose corticosteroids posttransplant, and additional peripheral blood donor T cells did not decrease the incidence of graft failure. In addition, type of leukemia, time from diagnosis to transplant, an intact spleen, or the presence of antidonor leukocyte antibodies did not correlate with graft failure. To ensure engraftment of secondary transplants, further immunosuppression was necessary but was poorly tolerated. However, engraftment and survival could be achieved with an immunosuppressive regimen in which antithymocyte globulin and high dose methylprednisolone were administered both before and after infusions of secondary partially T-cell-depleted marrow grafts.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at the time of failure were consistently of host origin, bearing the phenotype of suppressor T cells (CD3+, CD8+, Leu 7+). A direct cytolytic effect on 51Cr-labeled donor-derived target cells was not detected, a finding that contrasts with the donor-specific cytotoxic host T lymphocytes that have been regularly observed in patients rejecting HLA nonidentical SBA -E- BMTs. However, these host T cells did exhibit a strong and specific suppressive activity against the donor marrow CFU-GM in vitro. Furthermore, in contrast to prior findings in durably engrafted recipients of SBA -E- BMTs, the lymphocytes isolated prior to or at the time of graft failure lacked natural killer surface antigen expression and effector function.\r"

Twenty-five (21%) of 120 patients developed moderate (grade II) to severe (grades III to IV) acute GVHD. Severe GVHD was only seen in patients older than 20 years of age. It is also notable that only 2 (5%) of 39 patients who received the combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine (MTX/CSP) for the prevention of GVHD developed grade II acute GVHD, and none developed grades III to IV acute GVHD. Thirteen (30%) of 44 patients receiving MTX alone and 10 (27%) of 37 patients receiving CSP alone developed grades II to IV acute GVHD. Multivariate life-table analysis indicated that the prophylaxis by MTX/CSP was the risk factor for the low incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD. Compared with the reported incidence of acute GVHD in the patients of the United States, lower incidence of acute GVHD in Japanese BMT patients might be attributable to a lesser degree of genetic diversity in histocompatibility antigens among Japanese.\r"

Three to five times greater numbers of lethally irradiated (1,200 to 1,350 cGy) C57B1/6 (H-2b) mice given 10(7) T-cell-depleted Balb/c (H-2d) BM cells survived over 6 weeks if also treated with a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 10 micrograms IL-1 20 hours before or from 1 to 3 hours after radiation. The spleens of these mice were reconstituted predominantly, but not exclusively, with donor cells (54% to 91%). Histologic examination of the epidermal and gastrointestinal tissues of mice surviving more than 6 weeks did not reveal any evidence of graft-versus-host (GVH) disease; however, since 10% to 43% of the mice died between days 30 and 46, the possibility of a GVH syndrome in these mice cannot be excluded. The spleen cells from irradiated mice given BM transplants and IL-1, which consisted of greater than or equal to 85% donor cells, were able to generate specific T-cell cytotoxic killing of unrelated allogeneic donor cells but were unreactive to target cells bearing either host or donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. Thus, long-term mixed chimeric survivors were tolerant to recipient and donor alloantigens but exhibited immunologic competence. These results show that IL-1 promotes survival of lethally irradiated mice and that allogeneic hematopoietic cells in such animals develop tolerance to host MHC antigens. Although there are many unanswered questions, these data suggest that IL-1 may prove clinically useful in promoting BM engraftment.\r"

  ".W": "Graft rejection after marrow transplantation is generally thought to be mediated by alloreactive immune effector cells of host origin. Transfused blood products also contain immune cells capable of alloreactivity against both donor graft and host. To reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection, standard procedure is to irradiate all blood products with at least 1,500 rad before transfusion. We report a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who developed graft rejection and GVHD after receiving a T-cell-depleted transplant from a serologically HLA-A, B, DR/DQ matched and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) nonreactive unrelated donor. Cytogenetic analysis of marrow cells collected at the time of graft rejection revealed a PH1-negative female karyotype that was not consistent with donor cells. Use of specific minisatellite DNA probes (YNH 24, H-RAS, and 3' HVR) revealed the exclusive presence of third-party (neither donor nor recipient) restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLP) in both peripheral blood and marrow. Repeat RFLP analysis 3 days later showed persistence of this unique third-party banding pattern. DNA-based HLA-typing, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, also showed these cells to be derived from an individual whose HLA-DR type was distinct from donor and recipient. Together, these findings suggested the presence of a proliferating population of transfused cells possessing alloreactivity against both donor graft and host, despite prior irradiation of all blood products with 2,000 rad. Limiting dilution analysis to assess the frequency of irradiated lymphocytes able to respond to mitogen revealed an approximate 5- to 6-log reduction at 1,500 to 2,000 rad as compared with unirradiated controls. These data indicate that a small percentage of lymphocytes can survive irradiation at these doses and suggest that existing blood-product irradiation guidelines may require reassessment, especially in T-cell-depleted transplant recipients.\r"

Our assay is based on the detection of a biotinated HIV DNA probe hybridized to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase to identify positive cells. This assay is rapid in that it can be performed within a day and is sensitive enough to unambiguously identify a rare, single, positive cell. Patient samples derived from HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs and HIV-seropositive infants were analyzed before and after coculture with normal PBL. The same samples were investigated using a Dupont P24 antigen-capture kit. It was found that ISH always detected the same positive samples as antigen capture, often in shorter times of coculture. In situ hybridization detected over half of our HIV-infected hemophilia patient population as virus positive, whereas the antigen capture assay detected less than one fourth as virus positive. In situ hybridization detected positive cells directly, without coculture, in 12 out of 35 (34%) hemophiliacs and in three out of eight (37%) infants. The speed, sensitivity, and confidence of ISH and nonisotopic detection indicates that it will be useful as a tool for clinical research and diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the mechanisms controlling hematopoietic engraftment in untreated, normal recipients, we investigated the fate of parental, donor hematopoietic stem cells after apparent graft failures in unconditioned F1 hybrid recipient mice. By administering an anti-host H-2K monoclonal antibody, which targets host cells but spares the donor, we found that chimerism could be induced by delayed conditioning in animals with apparent graft failure. Engraftment kinetics in the host were followed by typing individual colony forming unit--granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies for their origin and showed that parental cells, which were otherwise virtually absent, become promptly detectable within the marrow cavity after antibody administration. Marrow transfers to secondary hosts suggested that parental stem cells were present in the marrow of the untreated recipients. These findings establish that the elimination of all parental cells cannot account for the absence of peripheral blood chimerism in the unconditioned F1 hybrid recipient. Thus, viable and functional donor stem cells, which remain quiescent in the host marrow, can be activated by a selective conditioning regimen and can rescue an apparent graft failure. The selective activation in vivo of marked stem cells in an unirradiated microenvironment may be a useful system to study the regulation of cellular proliferation within the marrow cavity.\r"

We determined PDGF levels in the circulation (outside platelets) in patients with myeloproliferative diseases. Platelet-poor plasma and urine PDGF were significantly elevated in patients with myelofibrosis (6.2 +/- 2.0 micrograms/L for plasma; 7.8 +/- 2.4 micrograms/L for urine) and essential thrombocythemia (5.5 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L for plasma; 11.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/L for urine), but not in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (2.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/L for plasma; 2.8 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L for urine). Polycythemia vera produced an intermediate pattern: although plasma PDGF was within the normal range (2.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L), urine levels were increased (3.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L). These results show that PDGF is increased in the circulation in some but not all myeloproliferative diseases, and suggest that this is due to abnormal in vivo release from either megakaryocytes in the bone marrow or circulating platelets.\r"

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vitro augments this cytotoxicity and used therapeutically might thereby promote the eradication of minimal residual disease. In order to assess whether these effects on cytotoxicity can be reproduced in vivo, we studied changes in number, phenotype, and MHC unrestricted cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with hematologic malignancy receiving IL-2 infusions. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma were treated after cytotoxic chemotherapy or autologous BMT. IL-2 infusions produced an initial lymphopenia, followed by a progressive recovery in mononuclear cell numbers and a rebound lymphocytosis after the termination of treatment. This affected all lymphocyte subsets; in particular CD25 (IL-2 receptor) positive cell numbers rose sevenfold. Cells with the ability to kill a natural killer (NK)-resistant, lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK)-sensitive target appeared in the circulation during 16 of 19 infusions and mean LAK activity rose from 5.9% to 15.5% during infusion (E:T ratio, 50:1; P less than .001). During IL-2 infusion, cells present in the peripheral blood inhibited the growth of myeloid leukemia blasts in agar after overnight co-culture. Depletion experiments showed that LAK activity was mediated by cells of both CD3- CD16+ (NK derived) and CD3+ CD16- (T derived) subsets. LAK precursor activity in peripheral blood also significantly increased during IL-2 infusion. Increases in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) unrestricted cytotoxicity can be produced by IL-2 infusions in vivo and may result in improved relapse-free survival following chemotherapy or BMT.\r"

We found that TGF-beta 1 could induce hemoglobin accumulation in K-562 cells. Various clones were selected on the basis of the inducibility of hemoglobinization by TGF-beta 1. One high response clone (no. 1) and one low response clone (no. 8) were studied in detail. Hemoglobin accumulation peaked on day 5 of culture in the presence of TGF-beta 1 (0.5 ng/mL, 20 pmol/L), when 90% of clone 1 cells, 55% of parent line cells, and less than 10% of clone 8 cells contained hemoglobin. There was a concomitant reduction in proliferation of 60% for clone 1, 40% for the parent line, and 30% for the clone 8 on day 5 of culture. Quantitative analysis showed that the hemoglobin contents in clone 1 after 5-day induction by TGF-beta 1 and hemin were 1.0 pg/cell and 2.9 pg/cell, respectively. The hemoglobin induced by TGF-beta 1 showed the same electrophoretic characteristics as the hemoglobin induced by hemin. The expression of epsilon-globin mRNA was minimally detectable in control cells and was induced in both TGF-beta 1 and hemin treated cells. Other cytokines with potential effects on K-562 cell proliferation and differentiation were also studied. Interleukin-1, interleukin-3, interferon alpha, interferon gamma, and inhibin, tested as single agents, showed minimal effects on proliferation. None of these agents could induce hemoglobinization or inhibit the hemoglobinization induced by TGF-beta 1.\r"

  ".W": "The role of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes in the regulation of human hematopoiesis is controversial. NK-mediated inhibition of colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells has been irregularly reported for various cell lineages. In an effort to clarify such disparate findings, we studied the interaction of clearly defined NK and partially purified progenitor cell populations. Cell sorter purified CD16 positive blood NK cells and enriched autologous marrow progenitors were co-incubated at various lymphocyte to marrow cell ratios and then cultured in methylcellulose. There was no inhibition of myeloid, erythroid, or mixed colony formation. Similarly, activation of CD16 positive lymphocytes by interleukin-2 (IL-2) before co-incubation and co-culture did not result in inhibition of colony formation. Furthermore, in a newly designed assay system, we demonstrated that NK cells, which did not modulate colony-formation, remained capable of recognizing and killing rare K562 target cells seeded within the marrow cell population. Our results indicate that unstimulated and IL-2 activated isolated blood NK cells coexist with functioning autologous marrow progenitors in vitro.\r"

These MSS lines support the proliferation and differentiation of the erythroid progenitor cells from mouse fetal livers and bone marrow in a semisolid medium in the presence of erythropoietin. Larger colonies of over 1,000 benzidine-positive erythroid cells were developed from the fetal liver cells on the MSS cell layers after 6 days of incubation. These layers also support the maturation of the erythroid cells since the enucleation process of the latter was observed in large erythroid colonies. Metabolically active MSS cells are apparently required to support the proliferation and differentiation of the erythroid progenitor cells, because neither the MSS cells inactivated with fixation nor the conditioned media of MSS cells promoted the erythroid colony formation. These studies demonstrate that MSS lines specifically support the proliferation and differentiation of the erythroid progenitor cells in vitro and that stroma cells may have a critical function in blood formation in the mouse spleen.\r"

We evaluated the ability of three different IVIgG preparations to inhibit the in vitro binding of autoantibody to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. ITP plasma, known to contain anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, was incubated overnight with either IVIgG or bovine serum albumin (BSA) followed by measurement of the autoantibody titer. Binding of autoantibody from eight ITP patients was inhibited by IVIgG in proportion to the IVIgG concentration. Using 3.2% IVIgG, compatible with therapeutic concentrations expected in vivo, mean inhibition of autoantibody binding ranged from 20.2% to 41.3%. No inhibition by IVIgG of alloantibody binding to the same or different molecules was detected (five patients with anti-GPIIb/IIIa and two with anti-HLA alloantibodies). F(ab')2 fragments of IVIgG also inhibited the binding of both plasma autoantibodies and purified anti-GPIIb/IIIA autoantibodies prepared by elution from antigen affinity columns. A portion of the anti-idiotypic antibodies could be adsorbed from IVIgG using insolubilized, purified anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibody. These results show that IVIgG preparations from normal donors contain anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against idiotypes located on GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies but do not have anti-idiotypes to platelet alloantibodies against the same or different molecules. The importance of these anti-idiotypic antibodies in the therapeutic response to IVIgG remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin K deficiency or administration of vitamin K antagonists results in the biosynthesis of abnormal des-gamma-carboxy forms of the vitamin K-dependent proteins. Monoclonal antibody H-11 binds several vitamin K-dependent proteins at a determinant that includes the first two residues of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. Antibody H-11 binds fully carboxylated prothrombin and protein C in the presence of EDTA but binding is inhibited by the divalent metal ions, calcium, magnesium, and manganese. By contrast, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin and protein C bind antibody H-11 the same in the presence of EDTA or calcium ion. Antibody H-11 thus appears to bind a conserved antigenic site containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid that in the presence of divalent metal ion undergoes a conformational transition. This ability of antibody H-11 to bind des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin and protein C in the presence of calcium ion allowed the development of an immunoassay for these proteins in plasma. Prothrombin and protein C from stably anticoagulated individuals receiving warfarin were characterized by their ability to bind antibody H-11 in the presence of calcium ion. Binding of prothrombin and protein C to antibody H-11 in the presence of calcium correlated temporally with warfarin administration. The inability of calcium ion to inhibit binding of antibody H-11 to abnormal prothrombin and protein C in plasma suggests that the circulating forms of both proteins following warfarin administration cannot undergo the metal ion-dependent conformational transition that includes sequence residues 1 through 12.\r"

On the average, heterozygotes had low levels of vWF in both platelets and plasma. There was, however, considerable heterogeneity, with four distinct patterns. Eleven heterozygotes had concordant reduction of vWF:Ag and Ricof in both plasma and platelets; five had low levels of vWF:Ag and Ricof in plasma contrasting with normal levels in platelets; eight had a peculiar pattern, the reverse of the above (ie, low levels in platelets and normal levels in plasma); and in one, both vWF measurements were normal in plasma and platelets. These patterns were genetically determined: they were consistent in four couples of consanguineous heterozygotes and in two couples carrying the same gene deletion. Only the remaining three heterozygotes had no clearly identifiable pattern. Other findings of this study were that although most of the heterozygotes had normal bleeding times, the 7 of 28 who had prolonged bleeding times had concordantly low levels of vWF measurements in both plasma and platelets. In conclusion, this large series of obligatory heterozygotes provides evidence for phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of severe vWD.\r"

  ".U": "90028787\r", 
  ".W": "The gamma chain of human plasma fibrinogen is heterogeneous with three forms differing in length at the C-terminus. Alternative RNA splicing produces two gamma chain mRNAs encoding gamma 50 and gamma 57.5 polypeptides, while fibrinogen gamma 55 is produced by post-translational modification of the gamma 57.5 chain. The composition of purified variant gamma chain fibrinogens, which comprise 10% to 13% total plasma fibrinogen, is predominantly heterodimeric (A alpha, B beta, gamma 50/gamma 55 or A alpha, B beta, gamma 50/gamma 57.5), whereas the composition of purified fibrinogen with the major form of the gamma chain is homodimeric (A alpha, B beta, gamma 50/gamma 50). These gamma chain variations interrupt sequences that mediate platelet-fibrinogen interactions. Therefore, the structure and function of gamma 57.5 C-terminal sequences were investigated using synthetic peptides and a specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb), L2B. The L2B epitope was localized and included gamma 57.5 chain residues 409-412 (Arg-Pro-Glu-His), as determined by differential enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactivity with a His-412 deleted synthetic peptide and by Western blot analysis of plasmin cleaved fibrinogen gamma 57.5. L2B had no effect on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation supported by either fibrinogen gamma 50 or gamma 57.5. High concentrations (0.5 to 1 mmol/L) of synthetic peptide gamma 57.5 405-416 only weakly inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation supported by either fibrinogen gamma 50 or gamma 57.5. Binding of fibrinogen gamma 50 (IC50 = 780 mumol/L) or gamma 57.5 (IC50 = 650 mumol/L) to ADP-stimulated platelets was weakly inhibited, and MoAb L2B failed to inhibit fibrinogen gamma 57.5 binding. Peptide gamma 57.5 408-416 failed to dissociate platelet-bound fibrinogens. These data indicate that the gamma 408-416 sequence of fibrinogen gamma 55 or gamma 57.5 alone is unlikely to bind to the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein llb-llla (GPllb-llla), in support of platelet aggregation under physiologic conditions. The sequence recognized by L2B does not resemble known GPllb-llla binding site peptide sequences [Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) or gamma 50 400-411] as determined by competitive inhibition ELISA comparing these binding site synthetic peptides with gamma 57.5 408-416. This epitope is available for binding MoAb L2B in gamma 55 or gamma 57.5 chain dimers and binds to all gamma 57.5 408-416 epitopes equally in non-crosslinked and factor Xllla crosslinked fibrin clots.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with leukemic B-lymphoproliferative diseases (B-LPD) were evaluated for development of in vitro recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated killer (LAK) cells. B-cell cultures were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) containing 63% +/- 29% malignant cells. Short-term cultures were tested after 5-day activation with 500 U rIL-2/mL. Long-term cultures were maintained for 4 to 6 weeks by weekly addition of 500 U rIL-2 and autologous irradiated feeder cells. In the first week, the cells decreased considerably in the long-term cultures but thereafter cells proliferated (mainly T cells) on the average 300-fold (range 30- to 1,000-fold). In the short-term cultures, there was a 36% reduction of malignant B cells. In long-term cultures, B cells were reduced from 63% to 8%; three cultures still contained greater than 15% B cells. The CD16-positive cell percentage was comparable in both types of cultures and ranged from 2% to 17%. Effector cells lysing the natural killer (NK)-sensitive cell line K562 could be induced in all patients. Except in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and high malignant cell numbers, NK activity was already restored after 5 days. Optimal NK activity was obtained after 1.5 to 2.5 weeks. LAK cells killing NK-resistant lymphoma cell lines showed optimal activity after 2 to 3 weeks of culture. However, LAK cells killing greater than 10% of autologous malignant cells were obtained in only one third of the patients. The discrepancy between strong cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive (K562) target cells obtained in all patients and the cytotoxic activity against NK-resistant cell lines contrasts with the poor development of LAK cells against autologous tumor cells. This discrepancy does not appear to be explained by soluble inhibitory factors released during the tumor cultures, as allogeneic LAK cells were not inhibited by supernatants from patients' cultures. Further investigations are warranted to reveal cell-mediated inhibition by tumor cells or suppressor cells.\r"

Immunoglobulin (Ig) subclass typing performed on these paraproteins identified five as IgG1 kappa, one as an IgG3 lambda, and one as an IgA lambda. The IgG1 kappa paraproteins, purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, contained the majority of anti-HIV-1 antibody reactivity present in the five serum specimens (ranging from 1:5,000 to 1:500,000) as demonstrated by immunoblot. All five IgG1 paraproteins had at least two light chain species as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the antibodies were reactive with multiple HIV-1 viral antigens. In contrast, the electrophoretically purified IgG3 lambda and IgA lambda paraproteins did not react with HIV-1 antigens and only one light chain species was detected by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent clinical evaluation of these patients following the initial observation of paraproteinemias failed to correlate the presence of paraproteins with the development of lymphoma over a 2 to 3 year period. These data support the hypothesis that IgG1 paraproteins present in the sera of HIV-1 infected individuals reflect a normal albeit exuberant polyclonal immune response to HIV-1 viral antigens. In contrast, the clinical significance of an IgG3 lambda or an IgA lambda paraprotein is unclear at present.\r"

In this report we describe an interesting exception to the parallel phenotypic features of activated T cells and malignant CD4+ T cells. A monoclonal antibody (MoAb; termed 27.2) that was raised to HTLV-1+, CD4+25+ leukemic T cells stained weakly 25% of peripheral T cells, including approximately 50% of CD8+ T cells and 20% of CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the surface density of the 27.2 antigen was unchanged or diminished when normal T cells were activated by antigen. However, 3/4 Sezary cases and 4/8 cases of ATL had relatively high densities of the 27.2 antigen. Immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the NP-40-solubilized membranes of surface-iodinated ATL cells indicated that MoAb 27.2 reacted with a 75 Kd molecule. The size and distribution of the 27.2 antigen on T cell subsets suggested that it might be the enzyme ecto-5' nucleotidase (NT), a phosphatidylinositol-linked enzyme that catalyzes dephosphorylation of monophosphate nucleotides to their respective nucleosides. This was confirmed by demonstrating that lymphocyte ecto-5'NT activity was blocked partially and inhibited completely by preincubating cells with MoAb 27.2 for 1 hour at 4 degrees C and 24 hours at 37 degrees C, respectively. When used with a second MoAb (27.1) to a novel T cell activation antigen found on all CTCL and ATL leukemias examined, 27.2 was found to discriminate between normal and leukemic T cells in two patients with ATL. These studies suggest that ecto-5'NT has diagnostic value in T cell malignancies and may be aberrantly expressed in some cases of ATL and CTCL.\r"

In vitro shed membrane cCLLa was comparable in all patients (n = 15) on a per cCLLa-positive cell basis but was independent of cCLLa density (r = .46), absolute lymphocyte count ([ALC] r = .46) and stage (r = .44). In contrast, serum cCLLa (n = 31) correlated with absolute cCLLa-positive cell count (r = .92) and to a lesser extent with stage (r = .67), but was independent of cCLLa density (r = .47). cCLLa modulation was assessed from changes in membrane density estimated by radioreceptor assay before and after in vitro exposure to anti-cCLLa monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CLL2. Immune precipitation studies of metabolically labeled CLL cells showed that modulated cCLLa was internalized as judged by its detection within modulated cells but not in their supernatants. Intact cCLLa-CLL2 complexes were not detected within the modulated cells nor in their supernatants. Regeneration of modulated cCLLa was rapid with return to baseline density levels within 24 hours of antibody removal. Modulation was specific and depended on exposure time, medium temperature, and on antibody titer; correlated with extent of disease (versus absolute lymphocyte count, r = .79; versus stage, r = .66; n = 22); was independent of cCLLa density or affinity (r = .44 to r = .57; n = 11); and was unaffected by T cells or by monocytes (n = 14).\r"

The CD14+/CD16+ cells can be assigned to the monocyte lineage based on typical morphology, on expression of additional monocyte-associated molecules, on the ability to form reactive oxygen intermediates and on the expression of monocyte-specific NaF-sensitive esterase. Light scatter analysis revealed lower forward angle and right angle light scatter for the CD14+/CD16+ cells compared with the regular monocytes, and the average cell size was determined to be 13.8 and 18.4 microns, respectively. Expression of class II antigens on these \"small monocytes\" was twofold higher compared with the regular monocytes. By contrast, the capacity to perform adherence to plastic surfaces, as well as the ability to phagocytize antibody-coated erythrocytes was clearly reduced in the CD14+/CD16+ monocyte subset as compared with the regular monocytes. Hence the CD14+/CD16+ cells appear to represent a new monocyte subset with a distinct functional repertoire. A survey of various tissues revealed that a large proportion of the alveolar macrophages, but not of the peritoneal macrophages, express the CD14+/CD16+ phenotype.\r"

When the HL-60 human myeloid cell line is grown in a selenium-deficient medium, GPx enzymatic activity decreases 30-fold compared with selenium-replete cells. Upon return to a medium containing selenium in the form of selenite, GPx activity in the cells starts to increase within 48 hours and reaches maximal (selenium-replete) levels at 7 days. Steady-state immunoreactive protein levels correlate with enzymatic activity. Cycloheximide inhibits the rise in GPx activity that accompanies selenium replenishment, indicating that protein synthesis is required for the increase. However, GPx mRNA levels and the rate of transcription of the human GPx gene change very little and thus appear to be independent of the selenium supply. Thus the human GPx gene appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally, probably cotranslationally, in response to selenium availability.\r"

Surprisingly, a five- or ninefold increase in SOD activity yielded no additional protection against superoxide-generating drugs (phenazine methosulfate or menadione sodium bisulfite). No significant differences were observed between the control and SOD-loaded RBCs in O2-driven methemoglobin formation or generation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. In contrast, RBCs with elevated SOD activity pretreated with sodium azide (to block catalase activity) or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (to deplete reduced glutathione, GSH) showed significantly enhanced methemoglobin generation in response to superoxide generating drugs. No differential response was noted between the control, control-resealed, and SOD-loaded RBCs to oxidants other than superoxide. Based on our results and other data, we conclude that elevated SOD activity may imbalance cellular oxidant defense, resulting in enhanced oxidation due to the accelerated generation of H2O2, the product of O2- dismutation. This effect is significantly exacerbated under conditions in which H2O2 catabolism is altered.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is probably the most common disease-producing genetic polymorphism of humans. Virtually all G6PD-deficient Africans show the G6PD A- phenotype, an electrophoretically rapid, deficient enzyme. The recently acquired ability to identify the point mutations producing the different variants has given us new insights into the population genetics of G6PD variants. Twenty-nine males with the G6PD A- phenotype were studied. They were of African, Mexican, Spanish, and US white ethnic origin. All had the A---G transition at nucleotide 376 characteristic of G6PD A. In each case, one of three additional mutations was present, at nucleotides 202, 680, or 968. That in this population second mutations producing G6PD deficiency occurred only on the genetic background of G6PD A suggests that G6PD A was at one time the most common type of G6PD in Africa. However, the nucleotide sequence of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) G6PD indicates that the primordial human type of G6PD was G6PD B.\r"

  ".W": "Adult dogs with phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency have compensated hemolytic anemia, due to an absolute or functional deficiency of the muscle-type (M-type) subunit that normally accounts for a majority of total erythrocyte PFK activity in dogs. Potential effects of PFK deficiency on hematologic development were evaluated in dogs. Routine hematologic parameters were similar in normal and affected dogs when 1 day old, because all newborn dogs had erythrocyte PFK activities about three times that of normal adult dogs. Based on chromatographic separation of PFK isozymes and enzyme immunoprecipitation studies, the high PFK activity at birth was attributed to the predominance of the liver-type (L-type) subunit of PFK, which is negligible or absent in normal adult dog erythrocytes. Both total PFK activities and the amounts of L-type subunit present decreased dramatically during the first 6 to 8 weeks of life. The muscle-type subunit was negligible or absent at birth, but appeared and increased as the L-type decreased in normal dogs. These changes may result from the replacement of erythrocytes formed in the fetus with those formed after birth. A postnatal physiologic anemia developed to a similar degree in both affected and normal dogs because of decreases in both mean corpuscular volume and erythrocyte numbers. Reticulocyte counts were high in all dogs at birth and remained high in affected dogs, but decreased from 2 months of age onward in normal dogs. Erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) values were very low in all newborn pups and increased to values expected for adults in the respective groups by 2 to 4 weeks of age. A low 2,3-DPG concentration occurs in affected dogs because PFK deficiency inhibits glycolysis above the side shunt that forms 2,3-DPG.\r"

  ".W": "Erythrocytes must have the capacity to undergo marked membrane deformation and shape changes in order to circulate through capillaries and respond to a range of shear stresses. To study the interrelationships between membrane deformability and the capacity for shape transformation, we created rigid membranes using several agents and then examined the ability of these erythrocytes with rigid membranes to undergo amphipath-induced shape change. We have previously shown that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and a monoclonal antibody to glycophorin A (R-10) cause membrane rigidity as measured by ektacytometry. Experiments were therefore designed to produced comparably rigid membranes using WGA, R-10, and diamide, and then to test the ability of lysophosphatidylcholine to produce echinocytes, and primaquine to produce stomatocytes. We found that diamide treatment substantially blocked both types of shape change. In contrast, R-10 binding did not impair either primaquine- or lysophosphatidylcholine-induce shape change. Further, WGA blocked echinocyte transformation, as previously reported, but not stomatocytosis. Using reduced and unreduced gel electrophoresis and Triton extraction, we compared the biochemical changes associated with WGA-, diamide-, and R-10-induced rigidity, and found them to be different. We conclude that not all rigid cells are incapable of shape change, and therefore that decreased membrane deformability is not predictive of impaired capacity for shape change.\r"

  ".U": "90028804\r", 
  ".W": "In a registry of volunteer bone marrow donors, the relation between registry size and probability of finding an exact or partial match for a random recipient cannot be theoretically derived because it depends on specifics of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype frequencies in the donor and recipient populations. The relation must be explicitly calculated using empirically determined HLA haplotype frequency data for all possible pairings between a donor and a recipient population. This report describes a general solution to this problem. The method shows that the relation of the probability of matching to registry size is sigmoidal, with small increases in probability at the extremes of registry size and a middle range of registry size within which the probability of matching increases most sharply. This range determines the approximate size of the most cost-effective registry. In addition, for any pairing of donor and recipient populations, there is a maximum probability of identifying a match of a given quality for a random recipient, which cannot be exceeded even if registry size were infinite. This upper limit is a function of the frequency of blank (or unknown) alleles in the donor and recipient populations; the higher that frequency, the lower the maximum probability of achieving any given quality of match. The determinants of the probability of achieving a given quality of match with a given registry size are (1) the genetic heterogeneity within the recipient and donor populations, which increases the registry size required to achieve a given probability of matching, and (2) the degree of genetic homology between the donor and recipient populations, which increases the maximum probability of matching and also lowers registry size requirements. The method described here can be used to estimate donor pool size requirements using any donor and recipient populations for which HLA frequency data are available.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with disseminated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are only occasionally cured with standard chemotherapy regimens. Although most of these tumors are initially responsive to chemotherapy, in 40% to 70% of patients the lymphoma will eventually transform to an NHL of higher grade malignancy and a poorer prognosis. We treated 18 patients having an original diagnosis of follicular NHL with high-dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. The lymphomas of 10 of the patients had already undergone histologic transformation and eight still had a follicular histologic pattern. The former group had been followed for a longer time from the diagnosis of NHL and had been more extensively treated with conventional chemotherapy regimens. All eight patients with follicular NHL at the time of transplantation are alive for 246+ to 1,804+ days and seven of the patients are in complete remission. In contrast, of the 10 patients in histologic transformation only 1 is alive and in CR. This reflects the inability of these patients to tolerate the high-dose chemotherapy and myelosuppression as well as resistance of their lymphoma to this therapy. This difference in survival between the two groups was highly significant (P = .002). We conclude that the outcome of patients with follicular NHL transplanted early before histologic transformation is better than for those who are transplanted later in the course of their illness. Because of the relapsing behavior of follicular NHL, a longer follow-up is necessary to prove any impact on the natural history of the disease.\r"

Selected serum or plasma samples reactive by HTLV-I enzyme immunosorbent assay or gel-agglutination assays with at least one viral-specific band on Western immunoblot (WIB) were tested in six laboratories by four WIBs and four radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPAs) for antibodies to HTLV-I proteins encoded by gag (p19 and p24), env (gp46 and/or gp61), and tax (p40x) genes. One hundred forty-two donor sera were obtained from 38 Japanese, 69 American, and 35 Caribbean blood or plasma donors. Among these samples, WIB assays appeared more sensitive to p24 antibodies, whereas RIPAs were significantly more sensitive to gp61 antibodies. All sera (137) with gp61 antibodies had p24 antibodies. Of the 137 sera positive for p24 and gp61 antibodies, p19 antibodies were detected in 129 sera, and p40x antibodies were detected in 108. In sera with p19 antibodies and antibodies to env- or tax-encoded proteins, p24 antibodies were always present. Antibodies to p40x were not found in the absence of gp61 antibodies. Virological evidence of infection was found in seven American donors by lymphocyte coculture (one HTLV-I, one HTLV-II) or by polymerase chain reaction (three HTLV-I, two HTLV-II). Sera from all seven donors showed p24 and gp46 and/or gp61 antibodies. We suggest that seroreactivity to both p24 and gp46 and/or gp61 by WIB or RIPA or both are suitable criteria to confirm but not to distinguish HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections.\r"

We have assessed the effect of allopurinol, 300 mg daily for 2 weeks, on urine biochemistry in patients with EHO due to small bowel Crohn's disease and/or resections. Compliance with treatment was confirmed by a fall in plasma uric acid in every patient. Allopurinol failed to alter 24 h urinary oxalate excretion or oxalate concentration. There were also no significant changes in the urinary excretion of glycollate (like oxalate, a breakdown product of glyoxylate), citrate, magnesium or calcium, each of which was at the lower end of the normal range before and during treatment with allopurinol. It appears unlikely that allopurinol will prove useful in the prevention of urolithiasis in patients with EHO.\r"

The DNA content and the expression for each mAb were measured in separate samples with flow cytometry. The importance of local inflammatory reaction was measured objectively according to tumour grade. These cells formed 41, 32 and 31% of the total cell count for grade I, II and III tumours respectively. The percentage of each leucocyte population according to grade I, II or III was as follows: 8, 5 and 6% respectively for T-lymphocytes; 3, 3 and 4% for B-lymphocytes; 10, 7 and 6% for granulocytes; 17, 18 and 24% for macrophages. No relationship was found between mAb expression and DNA content of tumours. This study demonstrates the importance of the inflammatory reaction in bladder tumours and the preponderance of cells expressing a macrophage phenotype. In a flow cytometry study, leucocytes may mask the presence of a minor group of urothelial tumour cells with an elevated DNA content associated with a poor prognosis; on the other hand, host leucocytes within a tumour could be used as an internal reference for precise measurement of the DNA content of tumour cells.\r"

Non-responding patients had a poor prognosis: 14/30 (47%) developed metastatic disease and 13 died. In assessing the primary lesions, clinical understaging was significant. Of 15 patients who were TO cystoscopically prior to surgery, 6 (40%) had residual disease in the pathological specimen, including 4 with muscle infiltration; 23 patients (32%) remained clinically staged, only 8 of whom remain disease-free.

Maximum bladder capacity, voiding and residual bladder volumes, average and maximum urine flow rates and urine flow patterns were estimated. The index of urine transport (IUT), representing the relationship between urine flow rate and bladder volume, was introduced as a measure of outflow capability. Of 129 children without evidence of outflow obstruction, 90% had a normal urine flow pattern; in 96% the average IUT was 0.8 or higher and in 87% the maximum IUT was 1.2 or higher. A sawtooth-shaped pattern with both normal and abnormal IUT values was observed in 10% of these children. In 63% of the children with outflow tract obstruction there was a low, flat urine flow pattern together with decreased IUT values. A sawtooth-shaped pattern with varying IUT values was observed in 15%, whereas in 20% the urine flow pattern and IUT values were normal. This extension of standard radionuclide renography as a method of screening lower urinary tract function is recommended. It is at least as good as conventional direct urine flow rate recording, it has the advantage of being non-invasive and it is also part of an established urological investigation.\r"

No difference was found between patients and controls in the incidence of infection by Chlamydia trachomatis or other sexually transmitted organisms. The numbers of lactobacilli and other fastidious organisms in the urine of patients with either mild or severe symptoms were similar and did not differ from the numbers in the urine of control subjects. The numbers of leucocytes in urine were also similar in both patients and controls. Our findings support the view that the urethral syndrome is not caused by bacterial or chlamydial infection.\r"

The spiral allowed unobstructed voiding and is a good alternative to an indwelling urethral catheter. We recommend insertion of a spiral in patients with urinary retention if the waiting period for TURP is long or if the patient is unfit for surgery.\r"

Local recurrence within the treated breast occurred in 56 patients (21 per cent), in 18 (6.8 per cent) of whom it was gross and uncontrollable. An analysis of clinicopathological features shows patient age, nodal status, tumour size, presence of definitive vascular invasion, adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ and grade to be predictive of local recurrence. A Cox's multivariate analysis of these factors shows the first four to be independently significant. The factors can be combined as a prognostic index which allows identification of patients at high risk of local recurrence. On the basis of these findings we have altered our selection policy for patients suitable for breast conservation.\r"

All the patients were European despite the fact that 15 per cent of the local population is either Maori or Polynesian. The average age at presentation was 62 years and 13 of the 15 patients were women. The duration of symptoms was short: on average 9 months. Where feasible a definitive resection of the lesion was performed but this could only be performed in six of the 15 cases. The commonest histological type was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which accounted for 14 of the 15 cases with the large cell variant being the most common (five cases). The mean period of follow-up was 3.3 years: only eight patients were alive and well at that time. The prognostic factors that influenced outcome were: (1) the histology of the lesion - large cell lymphoma carried a bad outlook; (2) whether the lesion could be totally resected or not - five out of six patients undergoing total resection remain alive and well; (3) the presence of pre-existing Hashimoto's thyroiditis was a favourable prognostic factor as only one patient without underlying Hashimoto's disease or positive antithyroid antibodies was alive at the end of the study; (4) male sex may also be an unfavourable prognostic factor as both men in the study died of disease 0.3 and 5 years after diagnosis.\r"

Non-cyclical breast pain was subdivided into true non-cyclical mastalgia (35 patients) and musculoskeletal pain (37 patients), the latter including Tietze's syndrome and other causes of chest wall pain. Mean age at presentation was significantly greater in the musculoskeletal group (39.3 versus 33.9 years) with a shorter mean duration of pain (14.7 versus 35.4 months) compared with the non-cyclical mastalgia group. True non-cyclical mastalgia was commonly bilateral and located within the upper outer quadrant of the breast, whereas musculoskeletal pain was almost always along the lateral chest wall or costochondral junctions and unilateral in 92 per cent of cases. Breast nodularity was present in 54 per cent of patients with non-cyclical mastalgia, but in only four cases (11 per cent) in the musculoskeletal group. Nine of 14 patients (64 per cent) with non-cyclical mastalgia obtained a good clinical response to drug therapy (over half responding to danazol alone); 19 underwent spontaneous remission, but there was a prolonged mean time to pain resolution of 27 months. In the musculoskeletal group 33 of 34 patients (97 per cent) had a good response to steroid and local anaesthetic injection; three resolved spontaneously without treatment, with a mean time to pain resolution of 17 months. This study indicates that differentiation of musculoskeletal pain from non-cyclical mastalgia may lead to more effective treatment with some prediction of the overall prognosis.\r"

A total of 3843 cases was included in this study and an evaluation was made of the prognostic variables and lymph node involvement at various locations. Using a computer program, it is possible to compile a group of treated patients, with prognostic variables exactly matching those of an individual patient. Analysis of this group can then give an indication of the extent of lymph node dissection required for an individual patient. This paper gives a demonstration of the structure of such a system by means of an example.\r"

  ".W": "When performing total gastrectomy and oesophagojejunostomy with a circular stapling device two disadvantages are obvious; firstly, a purse-string suture is needed, and secondly the instrument can be extremely difficult to introduce if the oesophagus is narrow, so that the risk of rupture is substantial. We therefore developed the following technique. When the specimen is attached only to the oesophagus, and the Roux-en-Y loop has already been divided with a linear stapling device, a small incision is made on the back wall of the oesophagus and antimesenterically 6 cm distal to the cut end of the Roux-en-Y loop. The two forks of the GIA or the PLC 50 instrument are introduced into the oesophagus and jejunum, and the two organs are brought together at the hiatus. The instrument is closed and fired. The residual opening is closed with a linear stapler which also includes the front wall of the oesophagus. With a knife, the oesophagus and excessive amounts of tissue are trimmed away, and the oesophagojejunostomy is completed. Fifteen patients (median age 67 years) had a postoperative hospital stay of 10 days (range 8-45 days) after this operation. Leakage occurred in one patient and one patient died. The anastomosis took 12 min to perform (range 8-20 min). Three reoperations were needed: intestinal obstruction, leakage and a negative exploration. The median width of the oesophagojejunal anastomosis 6 months after operation was 32 mm (range 27-40 mm). Oesophagojejunostomy performed with two linear staplers allows a quick and reliable anastomosis independent of oesophageal lumen size and a time-consuming purse-string suture.\r"

The proportion of proximally localized primary tumour increased from 17 to 27 per cent (P = 0.008), and signet-ring cell carcinoma increased from 2 to 22 per cent (P less than 0.001). These changes were not relative with regard to the declining incidence of intestinal tumours, but absolute. Patients with proximally localized tumours were generally in a more advanced stage of disease than those with distally localized tumours, and thus had poorer survival rates. However, after stratifying into stages, the difference in survival disappeared. The survival rate of patients with signet-ring cell carcinoma was not significantly different from that of patients with other gastric tumours (P greater than 0.05). The discrepancy between the survival rates of Japanese and western gastric cancer patients is attributed by some authors to tumour-related factors. However, we believe that the similar trends found with regard to tumour localization and histology point towards comparable tumour behaviour in the two different geographical areas.\r"

Five patients had oesophageal perforation with a carcinoma; one had spontaneous perforation of an intrathoracic stomach; two had severe haemorrhage; and one had acute sterile mediastinitis. Following operation there was one postoperative death (11 per cent) and no major complications. Long-term survival was marred only by the development of further malignancy in four patients. Subtotal oesophagectomy has both theoretical and practical advantages over conventional oesophagogastrectomy in oesophageal emergencies and we suggest that it should be considered as the method of choice in the management of these difficult cases.\r"

  ".U": "90029345\r", 
  ".W": "Since December 1986, 40 laser angioplasty procedures have been performed using the energy from a pulsed NdYAG laser, delivering near infrared light (1064 nm) in 100-microseconds pulses of approximately 300 mJ per pulse, directly through a transparent sapphire tipped device. All patients had total occlusion of the superficial femoral artery and symptoms severe enough to warrant surgery, with ulceration or gangrene in eight, rest pain in 14 and severe claudication interfering with life-style in the others. The device was introduced through an antegrade puncture of the superficial or common femoral artery and laser recanalization was followed by attempted balloon angioplasty in all cases. Occlusions were a median length of 15 cm (range 2-35 cm); ten patients had previously undergone failed attempts at conventional balloon angioplasty and four had occluded femoropopliteal grafts. Thirty-seven legs of 34 patients were treated with an average of 60 J (range 10-235 J) with successful recanalization in 27 and immediate reocclusion in seven. The 20 successful recanalizations have been followed up for up to 24 months (median 7 months) with only one late occlusion at 5 months. Failed recanalization was due to poor transmission by the delivery device in the early part of the series (five cases), repeated passage of the device down a collateral branch (four cases), dissection at the site of previous surgery (two cases) or no apparent reason (two cases). Immediate reocclusion was due to very poor run off in patients with severely ischaemic limbs (three cases) or technical difficulties with balloon dilatation (two cases). Complete symptomatic relief was obtained in all the cases of radiologically successful laser angioplasty. Early surgery was required in one case following reocclusion of the artery when an angioplasty balloon failed to deflate, and one patient suffered a skin reaction thought to be due to inadequate removal of the sterilizing solution. A different sterilizing procedure is now followed. Laser angioplasty can reduce the number of patients requiring bypass surgery and improvements in the device and access methods may reduce the number of untreatable cases.\r"

Graft blood flow, peripheral resistance and impedance were measured before and after the injection of 15 mg papaverine down the graft. The proportion of retrograde blood flow at the distal anastomosis was also measured. The success of a graft at 1 month was defined by patency on duplex ultrasound scanning, a rise in the Doppler ankle pressures and an improvement in the clinical state of the limb. By these criteria the 1-month primary success rate was 35 out of 47 (74 per cent). Graft blood flow was of little value in predicting graft outcome but, combined with segmental pressures, accurately located six of eight technical problems which were successfully corrected. After papaverine, the peripheral resistance of all the successful grafts fell below one peripheral resistance unit (PRU). No single measurement was able to completely distinguish between success and failure, although discriminant analysis of all measurements was able to predict success with a sensitivity of 100 per cent and specificity of 97 per cent. A simpler combination of a peripheral resistance after papaverine less than 1 PRU and a retrograde blood flow less than 33 per cent predicted success, with a sensitivity of 97 per cent and specificity 83 per cent. These criteria have been validated on a further 26 grafts, achieving a sensitivity of 88 per cent and a specificity of 75 per cent. Simple operative measurements, using a newly developed Doppler flowmeter, enable the detection of technical problems and the accurate prediction of the early outcome of femorodistal grafting.\r"

The aim was to maintain the peak value just above the upper limit of the normal range. Adjustment of dosage began 24 h after surgery in the replacement group and 24 h after admission in the fracture group. Significant improvement in protection against postoperative deep vein thrombosis, assessed by venography, was observed in the adjusted group undergoing hip replacement (P = 0.013) and overall in both groups (P = 0.017) compared with a conventional fixed dose subcutaneous regimen (calcium heparin 5000 units, 8-hourly). In most instances, adjustment resulted in increased heparin dosage but this was not associated with any evidence of excessive bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "Intimal hyperplasia is the universal response to endothelial denudation and occurs after a variety of vascular procedures. In a proportion of cases the smooth muscle cell proliferation may lead to stenosis of the blood vessels. These vessels exhibit increased sensitivity to noradrenaline that can be reduced by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. Because the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and platelet-derived growth factor (which promotes vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation) act through the same metabolic pathway, it was postulated that alpha 1-adrenergic blockade might reduce the development of intimal hyperplasia. Twenty-eight New Zealand White rabbits underwent endothelial denudation of the aorta using a Fogarty balloon catheter. Test rabbits were treated with prazosin from the day of operation until they were killed. All rabbits were killed either 1 or 4 weeks after endothelial denudation. Intimal hyperplasia in cross-sections of the aorta was measured using an X-Y digitizer and was standardized in terms of percentage luminal reduction. Prazosin-treated rabbits had significantly less luminal reduction at 1 week (0.75(1.8) versus 9.7(3.1) per cent, mean (s.d.), P less than 0.001) and at 4 weeks (14.7(4.4) versus 25.3(12.8) per cent, P less than 0.05) than control rabbits. It is concluded that prazosin caused a major reduction in the development of intimal hyperplasia.\r"

Five per cent ethanolamine oleate, the sclerosant used, was injected into the oesophageal varices. There were significant increases in the concentrations of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B-beta-15-42 and fibrin degradation products-E after the sclero-therapy. At 1 h after the sclerotherapy the mean(s.e.m.) platelet aggregation was significantly suppressed to 71.9(4.2) per cent of that before the treatment (P less than 0.01). There was a gradual recovery within 1 week to the same level seen before the sclerotherapy. Thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, both stable products of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin respectively, showed significant temporary increases after the sclerotherapy (P less than 0.01). The peak increase in the level of thromboxane B2 was noted within 1 h after the sclerotherapy and earlier than that for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. This increased ratio of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 may be related to the marked limitation in platelet aggregation.\r"

Preoperative MSF-stimulated acid output was found to be correlated with preoperative basal acid output, and postoperative MSF-stimulated acid output was correlated with both preoperative basal acid output and postoperative basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid outputs. The addition of preoperative MSF-stimulated acid output to preoperative pentagastrin-stimulated acid output did not noticeably increase the close relationship between the latter and postoperative pentagastrin-stimulated acid output. It is concluded that basal and MSF-stimulated secretory rates overlap. Therefore, it is suggested that in both preoperative and postoperative conditions the addition of the sham-feeding test to the more simple basal and pentagastrin-stimulated studies could be discarded.\r"

The argon laser may be an ideal instrument for performing seromyotomy. This study compares anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior or truncal vagotomy with anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy in a canine preparation. Six dogs underwent anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy and six others underwent anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy. Gastric emptying and acid secretion studies were performed preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Operating time and blood loss were determined. Anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy was performed with the argon laser at 10 W, continuous, delivered through a 600 micron unsheathed quartz fibre. Anterior proximal gastric vagotomy and posterior truncal vagotomy were performed in the standard fashion. Solid phase gastric emptying was slowed with both operations (P less than 0.05) but this was not manifest clinically. Blood loss (millilitres) was less following anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy than following anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy (21(6.8) versus 95(28.1), mean (s.e.m.), P less than 0.05) but operating time was not significantly different between the groups. Mean basal acid secretion was reduced by 64 per cent 6 months after anterior lesser, curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy (P less than 0.05) and by 53 per cent after anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy (not significant). Mean stimulated acid secretion was reduced by 41 per cent 6 months after anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy (P less than 0.05) and by 24 per cent after anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy (not significant). We conclude that anterior lesser curvature argon laser seromyotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy is an acceptable alternative to anterior proximal gastric vagotomy/posterior truncal vagotomy and may provide superior parietal cell denervation with less operative blood loss.\r"

Complete obstruction was present in 148 cases (16.3 per cent), 280 cases (30.8 per cent) had partial obstruction and 480 (52.8 per cent) presented without obstruction. There were fewer Dukes' A tumours in those with complete obstruction (P less than 0.005) and greater numbers of advanced tumours (P less than 0.0005) compared with those without obstruction. This is reflected in a lower curative resection rate of 50.7 per cent in those with obstruction compared with 70.6 per cent in those without obstruction (P less than 0.001). However, after curative resection there was no significant difference in the distribution of tumour stage. Patients with complete obstruction showed a higher incidence of recurrence (P less than 0.01) after curative resection, consequent to an increased incidence of local recurrence (P less than 0.02). Five-year cancer-specific survival for the total series was decreased from 59.1 per cent in patients without obstruction to 31.8 per cent in those with complete obstruction (P less than 0.001). After curative resection there was also a significant reduction in survival (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that completely obstructing colonic cancers are more aggressive than other colonic cancers.\r"

This procedure preserves the entire mucosa of the anal canal. The histological appearances of the anal mucosa have been examined in 16 consecutive patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis. In 14 patients there was chronic inflammation characteristic of ulcerative colitis. Four patients had moderate dysplasia and in one of these patients an unsuspected adenocarcinoma of the anal canal extending down to the level of the dentate line was present. We believe that the anal mucosa should always be removed down to the level of the dentate line in restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis.\r"

A consecutive series of patients with PD was therefore examined for the presence of depression and neuropsychological deficits. Severity of depression was found to be the single most important factor associated with the severity of cognitive impairment. When PD patients with major depression were compared with an age and stage-matched group of nondepressed patients with PD using a neuropsychological battery, major depressed patients performed significantly worse than the nondepressed patients on all aspects of neuropsychological function tested. These impairments were most pronounced on frontal lobe tasks.\r"

We describe 14 patients with motor neuron disease who were considered for respiratory support; 11 received such support and all derived significant symptomatic improvement without distressing prolongation of life. Of the 8 patients with typical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 7 had predominant diaphragm weakness and 1 generalized respiratory muscle weakness; 7 received negative pressure ventilation by cuirass which improved both the quality of sleep and exercise tolerance. Three patients with predominantly bulbar disease had nocturnal apnoea or hypoventilation. Two received no support. One, who also developed diaphragm weakness, was treated by a cuirass, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and later nocturnal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Three patients with progressive muscular atrophy had predominant diaphragm weakness or nocturnal apnoea. These patients received nocturnal CPAP, cuirass or IPPV with symptomatic benefit. This series shows that some patients with motor neuron disease, mainly those with symptoms due to respiratory muscle weakness in the absence of severe bulbar impairment, derive symptomatic benefit from supported ventilation.\r"

They presented with a progressive disease bearing some clinical resemblance to Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome and displaying some pathological features of Pick's disease. Their illness began at the age of 59 to 66 yrs with focal dystonia and myoclonus of an arm, the 'alien hand' sign, or an akinetic-rigid syndrome. They developed a supranuclear gaze palsy, parkinsonian features and mild cerebellar signs. Two patients showed constructional dyspraxia when using the arms. The duration of disease to death was 4 to 6 yrs. Pathological examination showed frontoparietal atrophy with cortical cell loss, gliosis and Pick cells, but there was no significant hippocampal disease or Pick bodies in this region. There was nerve cell loss and gliosis in the thalamus, lentiform nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, red nucleus, midbrain tegmentum, substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Neuronal inclusions in the substantia nigra, termed corticobasal inclusions, were reminiscent of the globose neurofibrillary tangle of Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, and other pale inclusions resembled the pale body of Parkinson's disease, but Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles were generally absent. Some nigral inclusions were similar to those in Pick's disease. Despite some pathological similarities to Pick's disease we suggest that the distribution of nerve cell loss and the corticobasal inclusion are unique to corticobasal degeneration.\r"

Saccade latency, amplitude and peak velocity, smooth pursuit peak velocity, optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) maximal and mean velocities and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) suppression by vision or imagination were significantly altered in patients, whereas VOR gain in darkness was normal. Alterations of saccade latency and smooth pursuit peak velocity were more severe in the more advanced stages of the disease and saccade latency directed towards the symptomatic side was slightly delayed in hemiparkinsonian patients. Saccade amplitude improved 90 min after a single oral dose of L-DOPA. These results suggest a possible dopaminergic control of some ocular movements.\r"

Two coloured patterns were presented one above the other and the monkey chose one by touching it with a hand. On some trials, conflicting information was presented to the two visual hemifields. For example, in the left hemifield the stimulus associated with reward was in the higher position and in the right hemifield the stimulus associated with reward was in the lower position. On some of these conflict trials the monkeys were required to use the left hand and on others the right. Normal monkeys, monkeys with section of the anterior commissure and the posterior corpus callosum, and monkeys with section of the anterior commissure and the whole of the corpus callosum performed this task. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that following forebrain commissurotomy, the response made by each hand would be predominantly influenced by the visual information put into the hemisphere contralateral to that hand. If this is true then choices in the conflict test should vary systematically with hand use. This hypothesis was not confirmed. We conclude that when a monkey reaches to a rewarded visual stimulus, information about the reward history of the stimulus is integrated between the hemispheres before influencing the motor control of the hand that reaches, either by a peripheral or a subcortical route.\r"

Cultures were used for HSV infection either without additional treatment, or with pretreatment with nerve growth factor (NGF), or with subsequent exposure to medium containing neutralizing antibody to HSV or with a combination of NGF and antibody. The appearance of morphological changes in the cultured cells following HSV infection was delayed by treatment with NGF or neutralizing antibody alone. Both treatments given concurrently resulted in maximal delay; similar results were obtained for both PC12 and DRG cultures. The appearance of a variety of HSV-specified polypeptides identified by a polyspecific rabbit anti-HSV antibody and monoclonal antibodies to the product of immediate early (IE) gene 3, Vmw175 (1098 and 58S), to the major DNA binding protein (1147), to glycoprotein C, gC (1001), and of a minor heat shock protein (identified by monoclonal antibody T156), was followed after HSV infection by indirect immunofluorescence. Staining with polyspecific rabbit anti-HSV increased with time after infection both in intensity and extent and correlated well with the degree of the morphological changes. This staining was delayed by NGF treatment, by exposure to neutralizing antibody, and maximally by both treatments combined, the DRG and PC12 behaving very similarly. Labelling with monoclonal antibodies 1098, 58S and 1147 was increased and that with antibody 1001 decreased in PC12 cells by NGF treatment. No such increased labelling with 1098 was observed in DRG cultures after NGF treatment. It is proposed that NGF treatment leads to increased expression of Vmw175 and to a delay in the transition from early to late HSV polypeptide synthesis in PC12 cells. The expression of the cellular stress protein defined by T156 was upregulated after HSV infection. This upregulation was most marked in cultures treated with NGF.\r"

  ".U": "90029381\r", 
  ".W": "Quantitative thermal and mechanical algometry was studied in 4 human subjects exposed to various concentrations of capsaicin administered topically to the skin of the palm or forearm. Treated skin patches were assessed for changes in heat pain threshold and in mechanical pain threshold at various controlled temperatures. The results showed that: (1) in addition to heat hyperalgesia, capsaicin consistently induces overt mechanical hyperalgesia; (2) thermal and mechanical hyperalgesias are linearly dependent on the log of capsaicin dose; (3) mechanical hyperalgesia is increased by increasing skin temperature; (4) mechanical hyperalgesia is abolished by cooling the skin to a point about 10 degrees C below the threshold for heat pain, a temperature that does not impair touch or sharp pain sensation. These sensory effects of capsaicin are mediated by C fibres, since dissociated A fibre block established by compression-ischaemia does not abolish either spontaneous pain or mechanical hyperalgesia. In addition, abolition of mechanical hyperalgesia by cooling persists during A fibre block. Cooling thus appears to act directly, presumably decreasing hyperexcitability of the C nociceptor. Hyperalgesia is also transiently depressed for at least 30 min during the postischaemic period, well beyond the duration of paraesthesiae or overt hyperaemia. Sensory changes identical to those induced experimentally by capsaicin have been observed in patients with a particular variety of neuropathic pain (ABC syndrome) and have been termed polymodal hyperalgesia and cross modality threshold modulation (Ochoa, 1986; Ochoa et al., 1987). Based on these overall observations, it is postulated here that the sensory abnormalities induced by capsaicin and those observed in this particular variety of patients relate to primary hyperalgesia and share a common mechanism in that the excitable receptor membrane of polymodal C nociceptors behaves as if it 'misreads' temperature.\r"

Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs.\r"

Patients were then heated to determine the effect of sympathetic blockade on mediation of thermoregulatory facial flushing. Release of vasoconstrictor tone following stellate ganglion blockade was invariably followed by an increase in orbital and cheek temperature, and by similar but less consistent increases in temperature of the forehead, lips and chin. The amplitude of capillary pulsations recorded from the forehead and cheeks also increased on the side of stellate ganglion blockade. Flushing of the forehead and cheek on the sympathetically intact side during body heating far outweighed the extent of flushing after release of vasoconstrictor tone. The thermoregulatory response was prevented by sympathetic blockade, indicating that an active sympathetic vasodilator pathway had been interrupted. In contrast, the temperature of the orbit during body heating was not influenced by sympathetic blockade. Asymmetry of forehead temperature was detected before sympathetic blockade in 8 of 9 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, suggesting that autonomic disturbances in this condition may influence cervical sympathetic outflow. The results indicate that sympathetic vasodilator fibres passing through the stellate ganglion mediate thermoregulatory facial flushing, and that release of vasoconstrictor tone has only a minor influence on this response in most areas of the face.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of percutaneous microneurography was used to study the response properties of 68 cutaneous afferents in 8 diabetic patients and, for comparison, of 104 afferents in 12 normal control subjects. The diabetic patients were neurologically asymptomatic or had a mild sensory neuropathy. Three afferent categories were studied in the diabetic subjects (rapidly adapting type RA and slowly adapting SAI and SAII) in response to mechanical skin stimulation and abnormal responsiveness was encountered in all categories. Distinct abnormalities were seen in about 30% of the RA and in 20% of the SAI type nerve fibres. The abnormalities consisted of the generation of only single action potentials to above threshold stimuli (RA), and of high fatiguability to repetitive stimulation (SAI). A more subtle abnormality was additionally encountered in the slowly adapting SAI and SAII groups. This consisted of low discharge rates to sustained skin indentation, with values statistically significantly different from normal. Absolute mechanical response thresholds and receptive field configurations were similar between diabetic and normal units. The conduction velocities of individual nerve fibres were measured in response to intradermal electrical stimulation. They were similar to normal, regardless of whether the afferents displayed normal or abnormal responsiveness to physiological stimulation of the receptive fields. The data indicate that different cutaneous afferent categories are affected by the disease, and are limited in their ability to transmit trains of action potentials. As a consequence, physiological stimuli may be abnormally encoded in diabetic units. Two hypotheses, one morphological and one biophysical, are proposed for explaining the present findings. The results altogether provide a physiological basis for understanding nerve fibre dysfunction and sensory disturbances in human diabetic neuropathy.\r"

Otoneurological examination, including tympanoscopy, showed that nonphysiological mechanical stimulation of the otoliths by a (pathologically) hypermobile stapes footplate typically manifests with a pattern of sound-induced paroxysms of ocular tilt reaction (OTR), oscillopsia and postural imbalance (otolith Tullio phenomenon). The rare condition of sound-induced otolithic stimulation in an otherwise healthy young man offered a unique opportunity to investigate otolith reflex control of the eye, head and posture in man. Electro-oculographic recordings and special video analysis (time resolution: 1000 images/s) revealed an initial rapid and phasic counterclockwise rotatory upward deviation with a latency of 22 ms, followed by a smaller tonic effect which lasted as long as sound stimulation (480 +/- 20 Hz, 95 dB A). Latencies of the otolithic vestibulospinal reflex, recorded using surface EMG during upright stance with the eyes closed, were surprisingly short with activation of the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle 47 ms after the stimulus, and of the ipsilateral gastrocnemius muscle after 52 ms. A considerable postural pertubation was measured by means of a Kistler platform, with the shortest latency for displacement of the centre of pressure of 80 ms and a preferred body sway direction from right-backward to left-forward. When the Valsalva manoeuvre was performed, tonic eye movements and oscillopsia were induced opposite in direction to those produced by the sound reflecting a push-and-pull deviation of the otoliths.\r"

An important factor in the stabilization was a decrease in the rate of repeat section. The diagnosis and management of dystocia and fetal distress continue to put upward pressure on the cesarean section rate, which is higher than would be expected if recent practice guidelines had been fully implemented. There is a need for further research into the appropriate management of labour and delivery and into more targeted techniques for bringing practice into line with appropriate standards of care.\r"

  ".U": "90029987\r", 
  ".W": "I have attempted to address some critical issues relating to the introduction of generic aerosol bronchodilators in Canada. I approached Genpharm to obtain information on the data submitted to the HPB, including the number of subjects involved, but the company refused to divulge this information because it was concerned about the use of such information by its competitors. In addition to the in-vitro testing conducted by the HPB, should a single pharmacodynamic study be sufficient to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a drug that serves such a critical role in the prevention of serious illness and possibly death? If so, what will constitute the minimum requirements for the design of such a study? In general, what should be the minimum standards required for safety, efficacy and bioequivalence of aerosol bronchodilators? The next phase rests with the provincial governments. What criteria will they use to determine whether a generic aerosol bronchodilator will be considered bioequivalent? It is essential that the criteria for bioequivalence be developed by experts, and ideally those criteria should be agreed upon and accepted by federal and provincial regulatory bodies before a product is given the status of bioequivalence. Unless such a step is taken it will be difficult to have confidence that products can be considered interchangeable. The issue of interchangeability of aerosol bronchodilators demands immediate attention. Regulatory agencies are caught between those groups with vested interests on both sides. Since patients will either benefit or suffer as a consequence of regulatory decisions, action must be taken to ensure that the best decisions are made. Scientists, clinicians and government officials should convene as soon as possible to formulate a satisfactory approach to this problem of interchangeability. The medical and pharmaceutical professions need reliable information, and patients should not be denied less expensive generic drugs if it can be determined that they are comparable to the innovator's product.\r"

  ".W": "There is conflicting evidence as to whether physicians who are certified in family medicine practise differently from their noncertified colleagues and what those differences are. We examined the extent to which certification in family medicine is associated with differences in the practice patterns of primary care physicians as reflected in their billing patterns. Billing data for 1986 were obtained from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan for 269 certified physicians and 375 noncertified physicians who had graduated from Ontario medical schools between 1972 and 1983 and who practised as general practitioners or family physicians in Ontario. As a group, certificants provided fewer services per patient and billed less per patient seen per month. They were more likely than noncertificants to include counselling, psychotherapy, prenatal and obstetric care, nonemergency hospital visits, surgical services and visits to chronic care facilities in their service mix and to bill in more service categories. Certificants billed more for prenatal and obstetric care, intermediate assessments, chronic care and nonemergency hospital visits and less for psychotherapy and after-hours services than noncertificants. Many of the differences detected suggest a practice style consistent with the objectives for training and certification in family medicine. However, whether the differences observed in our study and in previous studies are related more to self-selection of physicians for certification or to the types of educational experiences cannot be directly assessed.\r"

Expectation was defined as a respondent's rating that a given practice would be reality, and importance was defined as a respondent's rating of the personal importance of a practice were all options possible. Subjects in the last 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy were asked by their obstetricians to complete a questionnaire; 231 mothers and 227 fathers responded, for a response rate of 95%. In each of six subcategories parents' importance ratings significantly exceeded their expectation ratings. Certain items were rated as relatively less important postnatally than prenatally and by multigravid women than by primigravid women. Parents' perceptions of available options reflect consistent discrepancy with what they wish were possible. However, increased efforts to inform parents of existing options and to provide the rationale for specific practices may reduce the discrepancy between importance and expectations. This would in turn heighten the likelihood of a psychologically positive birth experience for parents.\r"

Such data would be valuable in assessing patient exposure to benzodiazepines and would provide a context to estimate the risk-benefit ratio of these drugs. Analysis of benzodiazepine sales in 1978-87 in Canada, expressed as the defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, showed that the use of these drugs was stable during the first half of the decade, at 33 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day, then steadily increased from 1983 to 1987, reaching 48 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day in 1987. The total use of slowly eliminated benzodiazepines declined, whereas the overall use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines increased linearly. In 1978-83 Canada had the second-lowest total benzodiazepine use among several Western countries. The patterns of use and abuse of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines in 1978-84 showed a close correlation. Our findings indicate that data on drug use can be monitored and linked to clinical data, providing a mechanism for monitoring the relation between use and related illness.\r"

  ".W": "To assess sclerosing adenosis (SA) as an independent risk factor for subsequent invasive breast cancer (IBC), the authors reviewed 10,366 benign breast biopsy specimens (BB) obtained between 1950 and 1968 and identified 547 cases of SA meeting strict histologic criteria of expanded lobular units with whorled compressed acini. Of those women targeted for follow-up (3303, of whom 349 had SA), 84% were successfully followed for an average of 17 years. The relative risk for IBC among patients with SA regardless of the presence of atypical hyperplasia (AH) was 2.1. This risk decreased to 1.7 when patients with AH were excluded, and rose to 6.7 when only those patients with SA and AH were analyzed. The coexistence of a family history of IBC in a first-degree relative did not further elevate risk above that of SA alone when women with AH were excluded. Sclerosing adenosis was found to be positively associated with atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) as ALH was present in biopsy specimens with SA 2.7 times more frequently than in other biopsy specimens. Perimenopausal age, histologic calcification, and family history of IBC (FH) were also positively associated with SA. Sclerosing adenosis was most frequent in the perimenopausal period and had a weak association with family history of IBC. No association with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) was identified. The authors conclude sclerosing adenosis represents an independent risk factor for subsequent invasive breast cancer apart from its association with ALH, and the risk (excluding patients with coexistent atypical hyperplasia) is in the range of 1.7, times thereby justifying inclusion of sclerosing adenosis as a component of a group of histopathologically defined lesions termed \"proliferative breast disease without atypia\" which implies a relative cancer risk of 1.5 to 2.0.\r"

  ".W": "A protocol with postoperative adjuvant intraarterial (ia) chemotherapy using nimustine (ACNU) was followed at the University of Dusseldorf (Federal Republic of Germany) after histologic confirmation of malignant glioma of the brain. The first iaACNU procedure was performed within 10 days of surgery, and immediately before postoperative irradiation. After radiotherapy further iaACNU courses were given. The study population consisted of 35 primarily treated malignant gliomas World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV, i.e., glioblastomas (NIV). Of these tumors 11 showed early progressive disease (PD) (NIV primPD), whereas 24 had stable or responsive disease (NIV SD&RD). Seven patients with recurrent malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV (NIV recurrent) were also treated plus six patients with malignant gliomas WHO Grade III (NIII). Experience with 50 treated patients resulted from this study. The median survival time (MST) for the group NIV was 14.2 months; 41.0% of patients were long-term survivors. The MST for the group NIV primPD was 7.8 months; 9.1% of patients were long-term survivors. For the group NIV SD&RD a MST of 18.3 months and 66.7% of long-term survivors were determined. Patients with recurrent tumors on this treatment protocol had an additional MST of 6.1 months. The total MST after first surgery was 16.2 months. The incidence of complications was low. Systemic complications were infrequent or rare. Retinal disturbances were seen in two patients; leukoencephalopathy was not seen in our patients. In 10% of patients cerebral complications were found, which were irreversible in 2% of patients. Complications could not be assigned unequivocally to the nitrosourea. These results compare favorably with what is reported in the literature, demonstrate the potential value of iaACNU in the treatment of malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV, and should encourage the initiation of a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant iaACNU in the therapy of these tumors. The authors propose iaACNU as a valuable approach in the management of primarily diagnosed malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV, but cannot recommend the delay of iaACNU until the recurrence of a brain tumor.\r"

  ".U": "90030084\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective randomized study was done to determine the effect of different doxorubicin (Adriamycin [ADR], Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) administration (schedules every week versus every 3 weeks) on the productivity of a cyclophosphamide, ADR, cisplatin (CAP) chemotherapy regimen for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Electrocardiograms, multigated cardiac scans, echocardiograms, and endomyocardial biopsies were done serially for cardiac monitoring. Of 102 patients, 47 ahd inoperable limited disease (LD), 47 had extensive disease (ED), and eight had no evidence of disease. In the last group chemotherapy was given adjuvantly. Fifty-one patients were entered into each treatment arm. The groups were formed according to extent of disease and were comparable in terms of patient characteristics. In these groups, the overall response rates using both schedules in LD patients were similar: in patients without chest irradiation previously, there was a response of 35% with ADR weekly, and 31% with ADR triweekly; in LD patients with chest irradiation previously, the response was 20% with ADR weekly, and 25% with ADR triweekly; and in ED patients, 16% with ADR weekly, and 11% with ADR triweekly. There was no significant difference in survival between the two treatment groups. However, results for all responders suggested a longer duration of response with weekly than with triweekly ADR (complete plus partial response: 35.8 versus 11.4 weeks, P = 0.06; minor response: 34 versus 11.5 weeks, P = 0.003, respectively). Results also suggested that weekly ADR was less cardiotoxic than triweekly ADR: 29% of patients in the former group had no changes or only minor changes in endomyocardial biopsy results, whereas all patients in the latter group had at least grade 0.5 changes at a similar dosage. The median doses of weekly ADR were higher at the same endomyocardial biopsy-defined toxicity levels. No correlation was found between toxic effects defined by endomyocardial biopsy results and those defined by noninvasive monitoring techniques, although the number of patients assessed was small. Weekly ADR produced less granulocytopenia and a lower incidence of fever (6% versus 16%, P less than 0.001) than did triweekly ADR. Alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were significantly less for weekly ADR than triweekly Adr (P less than 0.0005, less than 0.0005, and less than 0.005, respectively). These data suggest that weekly ADR can achieve the same therapeutic results as the standard triweekly regimen with less cardiotoxicity, myelotoxicity, alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting in patients with NSCLC.\r"

  ".U": "90030088\r", 
  ".W": "Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is an S-phase active antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. We did a retrospective analysis on 48 patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who were treated with high-dose ara-C between 1982 and 1987. All patients received between 9 and 24 g/m2/course of treatment with 90% receiving 12g/m2/treatment. Fifteen patients (25%) achieved a complete or partial remission. Of these, five (10%) were complete responders. Long-term disease-free survival was maintained only in those responders who were consolidated with autologous bone marrow transplantation. Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression. Seventy-five percent of patients developed fever and neutropenia with an equivalent percent having severe thrombocytopenia sufficient to require platelet transfusion. Five patients (10%) had significant neurotoxicity. There were seven treatment-related deaths (15%). Patients in whom tumors contained a small cell component responded better than patients with purely large cell or undifferentiated lymphomas (50% versus 15%, P = 0.024). We conclude that high-dose ara-C given as 3g/m2 every 12 hours for four doses has a limited role when used as a single agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, there are subsets of patients who may respond favorably to this therapy.\r"

All Th-CLL cases were negative for antibodies against type I human T-leukemia virus (HTLV-I). Serum levels of sIL-2R were significantly increased in patients with Th-CLL with respect to controls (P less than 0.02) and this increase was related to the clinical course of the disease. In fact, patients with rapidly progressive disease (mean survival, 11.6 +/- 3 months) showed significantly higher concentrations of sIL-2R than patients with less aggressive disease (mean survival, 39.5 +/- 5 months) (16,223 U/ml +/- 5612 versus 1447 U/ml +/- 817; P less than 0.05). A significant positive correlation was found between sIL-2R concentrations and the number of CD4-positive cells (r = 0.64; P less than 0.05). These data point to the possible use of sIL-2R levels as a marker of active malignancy in patients with Th-CLL. Patients with LDGL showed increased sIL-2R values (721 U/ml +/- 112) with respect to controls (334 U/ml +/- 28; P less than 0.005). However, the sIL-2R levels were lower than those detected in Th-CLL patients (P less than 0.05). Among the different correlations the authors tried to establish, the only observed difference was found between serum sIL-2R levels in the group of CD3+ LDGL patients with respect to CD3- LDGL cases (P less than 0.05).\r"

Vinblastine was used in a dose of 1.6 mg/m2/d for 5 days, DTIC was used in a dose of 800 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 1, and cisplatin was used in a dose of 20 mg/m2/d for 4 days starting on day 2 of chemotherapy. The courses of chemotherapy were repeated at 3-week intervals. All patients were premedicated with antiemetics, and IV hydration was used before cisplatin. Fifty-two consecutive patients were registered and 50 were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 18 patients had a partial response (PR) for an overall response rate of 40% (95% confidence interval, 27% to 55%). The median duration of response was 9 months and the median survival time of the responders was 12 months. The overall median survival time of patients treated on this protocol was 9 months. The treatment was associated with significant toxicity consisting of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and partial hair loss. Additionally, neutropenia with a median nadir granulocyte count of 500/microliters was observed, and significant anemia required blood transfusions in a majority of the patients after three to four courses of chemotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy which required discontinuation of cisplatin after six to eight courses of chemotherapy. We believe that this triple-drug regimen has significant activity that appears to be superior to the single-agent activity of these drugs, both in terms of increased response rate and duration of response.\r"

Intravenous injection of 10(5), 10(6), and 2 x 10(6) TA3Ha cells into syngeneic Strain A mice led to liver or kidney tumor development in none of the 96, ten, and ten mice tested, respectively. In contrast, injection of 10(5) cells into mice immediately after hepatic wedge resection performed using milliwatt carbon dioxide laser and electrocautery resulted in tumor formation at the site of trauma in 21/37 (57%) and 25/52 (48%) mice, (P less than 0.001) respectively. Similar results were obtained in mice subjected to partial nephrectomy using the laser (nine of 18) and electrocautery (eight of 13). These results clearly demonstrate that surgical trauma renders a nonprivileged organ susceptible to experimental metastasis formation, and that at least in this model both laser and electrocautery have similar effects. Tumor cell injection 1, 7, and 10 days posthepatic surgery resulted in 36%, 20%, and 0% tumor formation, respectively, indicating that the earlier events in wound healing support tumor implantation and/or growth better than those later on. Frequency of tumor formation at sites of trauma in the peritoneum induced by scalpel blade, laser, and electrocautery were 28%, 50% and 82%, respectively. Peritoneal tumors were seen in 33% of the nonsurgical mice. Skin incisions induced with the three above probes had little influence on experimental metastasis formation. Thus the influence of trauma on tumor formation is not uniform in every organ.\r"

  ".U": "90030096\r", 
  ".W": "Two-hundred twenty-one patients with soft tissue sarcoma were treated from 1978 to 1983. Treatment was nonrandomized and consisted of neutron irradiation in 94 cases with gross tumor. Treatment was nonrandomized and consisted of neutron boost irradiation after photon-irradiation or electron-irradiation in 127 cases with no gross tumor after surgery. Patient distribution according to UICC (1978) criteria was 15, 100, and 106 of T1, T2, and T3 respectively. Distribution by pathologic grade was 54, 107, and 60 for Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 tumors. Distribution by tumor residuum after surgery was 23 cases without microscopic disease (R0), 104 with microscopic disease (R1), and 94 with gross residuum (R2) or nonoperative disease. Five-year follow-up reveals a significant difference (P = 0.024) in disease-free survival (DFS) for T1 (60%), T2 (71%), and T3 (29%, P = 0.016) tumors. Similarly, there are significant DFS differences among G 1 (74%), G 2 (48%, P = 0.035), and G 3 lesions (22%, P = 0.024). The impact of tumor bulk or residuum on DFS after operation is significant when comparing R0 (87%) and R1 (65%) disease (P = 0.042). The 5-year survival of patients who had gross residuum (R2) after surgery was significantly worse (26%, P = 0.003). Ninety percent of patients failed treatment locally and distally within 2 years. The late morbidity rate was 27% for neutron and 7% for neutron-boost irradiation. In our series and reported photon data, local control rates for tumors 5 to 10 cm with neutrons were 76% and 53%, respectively. Low energy (d(14) + Be) neutrons are considered beneficial in the postoperative treatment of well-differentiated soft tissue sarcomas where gross tumor remains. Neutron-boost irradiation is of potential benefit in the treatment after operation of T2-3, and G 1-2 tumors if there is microscopic residual tumor.\r"

  ".W": "The proper demarcation of diseased tissue is important for radiation therapy planning and treatment. The volume to be irradiated is usually identified on radiographs or on x-ray computed tomography (CT) sections. Magnetic resonance (MR)-derived images of the proton T2 relaxation times in small pixel elements, typically 0.5 mm2 or less, provide significantly sharper differentiation between normal and diseased tissue. The T2 values in tissue depend on the tissue composition, histologic condition, and physiologic environment within the tumor. Furthermore, for many tumors the histogram of T2 values has a clear biphasic distribution suggesting that T2 maps may be useful for the identification of necrotic or hypoxic regions within tumors. The distribution of T2 values within the tumor bed shows the general pattern that the T2 values are elevated with a range greater than that seen in normal muscle. Elevated T2 values are not by themselves diagnostic of malignancy; however, they demonstrate the heterogeneity of the microenvironment present within a tumor. The spatial distribution of T2 values is being explored as a method for computer assistance in the delineation of the target volume for treatment planning. In addition, MR P-31 spectroscopic examinations were performed on 30 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Although hampered by muscle contamination in some P-31 spectra obtained with surface coil profile localization techniques, significant trends can still be appreciated in our data. These trends include the following: (1) the P-31 spectra from malignant tissue have well-resolved spectral lines in the upfield region that correspond to Pi, phosphomonoester (PME), and phosphodiester (PDE) not usually seen in normal muscle; (2) the PDE/B-ATP and PME/B-ATP ratios are greater than unity in all cases; and (3) most of the tumors have higher PME peaks than PDE peaks. The P-31 spectra from patients treated with ionizing radiation changed during and after therapy. Some of the changes could be associated with alteration of the tumor metabolic activity or synthesis and breakdown of lipoproteins. These studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies may be useful for both radiotherapy treatment planning and the noninvasive monitoring of patients both before and during treatment.\r"

The TNF was measured by enzyme immunoassay using anti-recombinant human TNF antibody, and PGE2 was measured by radioimmunoassay. As a result, in high-stage bladder cancer patients, there was a significant inverse correlation between TNF and PGE2 production of monocytes. However, there was no significant correlation in control subjects and low stage patients. Accordingly, some patients with high-stage bladder cancer had higher TNF production but lower PGE2 production of monocytes, and vice versa.\r"

A correlation was found to exist between DT and patient age and, to an even greater extent, between DT and pathologic prognostic indicators such as histologic grading and nuclear grade. Inflammatory symptoms were not associated with DT, but were closely related to the size of the tumor and regional lymph node involvement. The date of detection of distant metastases depended heavily on the DT of the BC:BC with shorter DT = earlier metastatic spread. The presence of inflammatory signs was also decisive: within each DT category, inflammatory BC metastases were both more frequent and precocious.\r"

Comparisons were made among these groups and with healthy controls. Mean TBA reactivity (mumol malondialdehyde/L serum) was increased (P less than 0.01) in the T-cell leukemia group versus common ALL and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma patients and controls, respectively. The increase in lipoperoxidation products in T-cell ALL appeared to bear a positive relation to peripheral leukocyte counts, and was accompanied by increased serum prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in most representative cases. Indomethacin added to a childhood T-cell ALL line (SUP-T3), at a concentration known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vitro (i.e., 3 micrograms/mL), effected significant increases in the numbers of natural killer (NK; Leu-11+ and Leu-19+) cells (P less than 0.01) and B-lymphocytes (P less than 0.05), and significant decreases in cell viability (P less than 0.01).

A high activity toward nitrogen oxidation reactions was observed. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine, a colon-specific carcinogen, was metabolized at a higher rate in vitro by human colon microsomes as compared with the rat, and exhibited a km ten-fold lower, 1.03 mmol/l versus 9.68 mmol/l, respectively. This activity was inhibited by classic cytochrome P450 inhibitors; 70% inhibition was achieved using 70 mmol/l metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di-3-pyridyl-1-propanone), 20 mmol/l; SKF-525A (diethylaminoethyl-2,-2-diphenylvalerate HCl), or 350 mumol/l n-octylamine. These data suggest the presence of a stable, active mixed-function oxidase system in the human colon mucosa which has a preferential activity toward nitrogenous compounds and provides a mechanism for the activation of carcinogens. Its distribution in the colon appears to parallel the reported incidence of human colonic carcinomas.\r"

Liver biopsy specimens from 41 patients with Hodgkin's disease in the liver were compared with biopsy specimens from 84 patients without hepatic involvement. Patients with hepatic involvement by Hodgkin's disease are much more likely to have histologic evidence of portal infiltrates larger than 1 mm in diameter (78% versus 1%), acute cholangitis (85% versus 4%), portal edema (90% versus 8%), and portal infiltrates with a predominance of atypical lymphocytes (78% versus 12%) than patients with Hodgkin's disease who do not have hepatic involvement. When these features are observed alone or in combination in a liver biopsy specimen from a patient with proven or suspected Hodgkin's disease, a diligent search for RS cells is indicated, with serial sections and repeat biopsy if necessary.\r"

Three neoplasms, one with and two without metastases, were found to have cells with an abnormal DNA (DNA aneuploid) content. The occurrence or absence of DNA aneuploid cells did not predict behavior. In addition, there was no correlation of tumor DNA content with tumor size or patient age at the time of surgery. There was no significant difference in cell proliferation (%S + %G2/M) between metastatic and nonmetastatic DNA diploid tumors, however, there was an increase in cell proliferation in tumors with a DNA aneuploid stemline. Granulosa tumors are low-grade neoplasms. At least 90% are seen in Stage I, and metastasis occurs subsequently in 5% to 15% of these cases. Features of Stage I neoplasms associated with subsequent metastasis in some reports, but not all, are involvement of the capsule (Stage IC), large size, and high mitotic rate, 1-5 Providing definitive statements about the behavior of granulosa tumors is hampered by their rarity, the subjectivity of the diagnosis, and their sluggish behavior. We attempted to determine if flow cytometric analysis of DNA could identify granulosa tumors with metastatic potential. We compared DNA histograms from ten Stage IA granulosa tumors that did not metastasize during 22 to 47 years of follow-up with seven granulosa tumors that showed malignant behavior.\r"

The authors retrospectively assessed the clinicopathologic features and DNA ploidy of 103 cases of renal cell carcinoma, the latter determined by flow cytometry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. The study group comprised 63 men and 40 women (age, 28-80 years; mean, 57 years). Robson stage at diagnosis was Stage I in 52 patients, Stage II in 21, and Stage III in 30. Statistically significant variables in predicting outcome were Robson stage (P less than 0.0001), DNA ploidy (P = 0.0008), mitotic rate (MR, P less than 0.0001), worst nuclear grade (WNG, P = 0.00009), predominant nuclear grade (P = 0.019), and sex (P = 0.044). Tumor size, cell type, and architectural pattern were also assessed but did not prove to be significant. Statistically significant associations occurred between DNA ploidy and WNG (P less than 0.0001), stage (P = 0.0037), and MR (P = 0.015); between WNG and MR (P less than 0.0001) and stage (P = 0.0007); and between stage and MR (P = 0.002). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of all significant variables showed Robson stage, tumor ploidy, and MR to be independent, significant predictors of outcome. If ploidy data had not been available, WNG would have been independently significant. The authors conclude that DNA ploidy analysis provides significant predictive information on renal cell carcinoma.\r"

All Grade 3 tumors and 50% of the Grade 2 tumors were aneuploid, and the remainder were Grade 2 and diploid. All invasive tumors were aneuploid. Carcinoma in situ was found in some of the preselected biopsy specimens, all of which were aneuploid, from two patients. Close correlation thus was observed between aneuploidy and tumor invasiveness, whereas diploidy was seen only in noninvasive tumors with lower malignancy grade. Aneuploidy was also associated with increased risk of carcinoma in situ. The study indicated that DNA analysis may be useful for defining the malignant potential of urothelial tumors of the upper urinary tract more fully than conventional grading and staging permit.\r"

On microscopic examination, GCF showed an unique combination of spindle cell patterns, pleomorphic and multinucleated giant cells, myxoid areas, and distinctive sinusoid-like spaces. This unrecognized histomorphologic picture led to a misdiagnosis of sarcoma in 40% of the cases.

There were 12 male patients and 15 female patients; 19 were white, five were black, and three were Hispanic. They ranged from 6 to 28 years of age with a median of 14 years. Histologically there were three patterns: Ewing's-like, lymphoma-like, and spindle cell. All cases showed osteoid formation and a few had chondroid areas. There was cytoplasmic glycogen in ten cases. Initial treatment for MDAH patients included intraarterial infusion of cisplatin in ten, amputation in four, partial mandibulectomies in two, and biopsy with local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy in one. All POG patients had resection or amputation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve patients are alive, of whom nine have had significant follow-ups for 25 to 90 months. Fourteen patients are dead of lung, spine, and brain metastases from 1 to 23 months after initial diagnosis. One patient is alive with lung relapse at 4 months. In summary, SCO is a high-grade variant of osteosarcoma, with an incidence of up to 4% of all osteosarcomas, that affects patients of the same age group and has the same anatomic location as conventional osteosarcoma. Currently, SCO appears to have a prognosis that is the same as or slightly worse than that of conventional osteosarcoma. Furthermore, although intraarterial infusion is effective for the primary tumors in the bone, distant metastases are difficult to control.\r"

Invasive cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates continued to decrease among blacks and whites, although declines are moderating or plateauing among young whites. Carcinoma in situ rates have not changed greatly or have declined, more so among blacks than whites. Excess risks among blacks are less evident among younger than older age groups. Increasing trends were seen only among whites in certain age groups or with certain histologic types. Declining trends in cervical cancer appear related to the widespread use of cervical cytologic screening programs, which have counteracted increases anticipated from changes in risk factor prevalence. Continued surveillance is warranted, however, with special attention to the trends in cervical adenocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Subungual melanomas are one of the most common types of malignant melanoma among the Japanese population. Although most pigmented nail streaks are benign and remain unchanged in their color and shape for a long time, rarely are they precursor lesions of subungual melanomas i.e., a rapid growing pigmented nail streak resulting in diffuse melanosis of the nail is thought to be an early stage of subungual melanoma in situ. We found four patients with these changes: three of these patients were children. The lesions occurred on the right index finger, right thumb, left middle finger, and right great toe, respectively. A slightly haphazard combination of colors ranging from dark brown to black, the important characteristic of subungual melanoma in situ, was observed in two cases. In the remaining two cases, although the haphazard combination of colors was not distinctive, many fine, dark longitudinal lines were seen within diffuse, light-brownish pigmentation. Serial histologic examination of the excised tissue specimens showed great proliferation of vacuolated melanocytes with variable nuclear atypicality along the entire basal layer in all cases. These histologic changes were compatible with those of atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or intraepidermal melanoma (in situ melanoma), which is an early lesion of subungual melanoma. An adult case is thought to be a definite example of a subungual melanoma in situ. We also made the diagnosis of melanoma in situ in the remaining three cases of children with rapidly growing pigmented nail streaks because their histopathologic features were distinguishable from those of the adult case. However, there remains some hesitation about this because invasive subungual melanoma is rare in children.\r"

Among the many patients with symptoms, signs, or scintigraphic or radiographic findings suggesting possible epidural disease, a small proportion will have the lesion. The selection of patients for definitive imaging of the epidural space should be based on a determination of the risk of this complication. In this study, the medical records, plain spinal radiographs, bone scintigraphs and myelograms of 43 patients were analyzed retrospectively to assess the risk of epidural disease associated with specific clinical, radiographic, and scintigraphic findings. Cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spinal segments were evaluated independently. Symptomatic segments (SS) (N = 41), defined by focal pain or neurologic dysfunction, were distinguished from asymptomatic segments (AS). At SS, epidural disease was found at 86% and 8% of abnormal and normal spinal radiographs, respectively (P less than 0.001), and at 69% and 0% of abnormal and normal scintigrams, respectively (P less than 0.001), whereas at AS epidural disease occurred in 43% and 3% of abnormal and normal spinal radiographs, respectively (P less than 0.001), and 14% and 7% of abnormal and normal scintigrams, respectively (P = NS). Vertebral collapse was highly predictive of an epidural lesion. Epidural disease occurred in 12% of SS and 0% of AS with an abnormal scintigram and normal radiograph, 86% of SS and 45% of AS with abnormalities on both scintigram and radiograph, and at two AS when both were normal. Decision analysis applied to these data yielded a specific conditional probability of epidural disease for each combination of clinical, scintigraphic, and radiographic findings. These data provide a basis for the selection of patients for additional evaluation of the epidural space before neurologic deficits develop.\r"

  ".W": "Five hundred thirty-six cases of early breast cancer (T0 to T2, N0 to N1) treated with breast conservation therapy were monitored for a median interval of 64 months. Fifty-five locoregional failures occurred after a median interval of 40 months; the actuarial failure rate was 9% at 5 years and 19% at 10 years. Factors predicting locoregional failure were sought. Young patients had a higher risk of failure than older patients, although their actuarial survival rates were not different. Locoregional failure was defined as advanced if tumor involved skin or was fixed to the chest wall, the diameter was greater than 5 cm, or unresectable nodes were present. There was a significantly higher incidence of advanced recurrence with higher initial tumor stage. Overall, the 5-year survival rate after treatment of locoregional recurrence was 63%. Advanced locoregional failure, however, resulted in a median survival time of 37 months. Further study is required to explain the increased failure rate in younger women. Advanced locoregional failure rarely occurred after treatment of Stage 0 or Stage I tumors, supporting the selection of patients with early disease for breast conservation therapy.\r"

The 20 patients were subdivided into the following three groups: Group I (12 patients with surgery for PCC); Group II (4 patients with surgery for chronic cholangitis [but the final pathologic diagnosis confirmed PCC]); and Group III (4 patients with surgery for space-occupying liver lesions). No early postoperative mortality was noticed. The few complications that occurred were related to surgery for hepatolithiasis. Postoperative wound infection was the most common complication. The overall mean survival time was 20.5 months. Four patients survived for more than 3 years; one was even alive for more than 5 years after surgery.\r"

Modulation of LAK cell induction in TIL and PBMC by inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism also was examined. LAK cells were induced in vitro in isolated TIL and PBMC by culturing with 500 U/ml of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 3 to 5 days, and this was followed by the assessment of cytolytic activity against natural killer (NK)-resistant Chang hepatoma cells. LAK cell induction in the TIL was depressed significantly, compared with LAK cell induction in the PBMC of colon cancer patients (P less than 0.01). In the majority of cases, indomethacin augmented LAK cell induction in the TIL (P = 0.073 for the entire group, compared with cultures not treated with indomethacin) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) depressed LAK cell induction (P less than 0.05 for the entire group, compared with cultures not treated with NDGA). Further characterization of the mechanisms responsible for modulating LAK cell induction in the TIL of cancer patients may identify ways to optimize their use in adoptive cellular immunotherapy.\r"

The number of multipotential colonies which could be cultured in vitro was lower in the patient's peripheral blood than in normal controls.

The study included three groups of patients: one group of 10 patients with only one nonrecurrent, noninvasive bladder tumor (Ta), another group of 11 patients with recurrent noninvasive bladder tumors, and a third group of 14 patients with recurrent primary noninvasive bladder tumors who ultimately developed an invasive tumor. After standard fixation, embedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin-eosin staining an unbiased estimate of the mean volume of nuclei sampled with a chance proportional to their volume was calculated: nu v = pi/3.l3(0). Here lo is the length of the intercept through a test point hitting a nucleus measured in a random direction through the test point. In the primary tumor the mean, nuclear volume of the cells in tumors from patients with a single bladder tumor is small (141 micrograms 3 geometric mean) with only one of ten above 165 microns 3. The mean nuclear volume of the primary tumor cells in patients with recurrent noninvasive bladder tumors was slightly larger (195 microns 3 geometric mean) with five of 11 above 165 microns 3. The mean nuclear volume of the primary tumor cells in patients who ended up with invasive tumors was higher (245 microns 3 geometric mean) with 12 of 14 above 165 microns 3. A large mean nuclear volume of cells in noninvasive bladder tumors (Ta) indicates recurrence and an invasive potential. Considering that nearly all primary tumors were classified as Bergkvist Grade II tumors, the prognostic precision of absolute mean nuclear volume is noticeable. This simple and fast estimate of mean nuclear volume seems to provide objective data with high prognostic value in primary noninvasive bladder tumors (Ta).\r"

The frequency of cytologically identifiable tumor cells in the plating suspension was independent of the histologic type of tumor (ovarian carcinoma or others) and the nature of the specimen (solid tumor or malignant effusion). Nearly 66% of all specimens were cytologically negative. The in vitro sensitivity can be assessed in approximately 75% of cytologically positive specimens. Cytologic evaluation preceding soft-agar clonogenic assay of human tumors can reduce cost and effort by predicting colony-producing specimens.\r"

Because of the discrepancy of the amount of extracted LSA with the content of pure gangliosides in sera reported by other groups the authors analyzed the composition of the extracted LSA by immunochemical approaches. They were able to isolate considerable amounts of glycoproteins containing sialic acid as acid alpha-1-glycoprotein, antitrypsin, haptoglobin, antichymotrypsin, and immunoglobulins from the so-called \"LSA\" fraction. There is a very strong correlation between the raised LSA levels and the content of acid-alpha-1-glycoprotein in the sera of patients with malignancy. Therefore the term lipid-bound sialic acid applied to this test is misleading, since glycoproteins containing sialic acid are mostly responsible for the high \"LSA\" levels.\r"

The authors have studied a tumor of the pancreas that was characterized histologically by a proliferation of benign-appearing osteoclast-type giant cells in association with atypical, often bizarre mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated negative staining of the tumor cells with epithelial markers, including low-molecular weight keratins, carcinoembryonic antigen and epithelial membrane antigen, and positive staining with vimentin antibodies, supporting a fibroblastic line of differentiation. Electron microscopic examination also showed absence of ultrastructural features of epithelial differentiation such as microvilli, intercellular junctions, or desmosomes. The authors believe the current case represents a true sarcoma of the pancreas, currently best classified as a malignant fibrous histiocytoma, giant cell type. This tumor should be distinguished from the epithelial type of osteoclastic giant cell tumor of the pancreas.\r"

All cancer patients had relatively increased fractions (10% to 46%) of AV-hCG in their serum when compared with hCG from pregnant control subjects (less than 4% present as AV-hCG). After initiation of therapy in 12 patients with nonseminomatous testicular tumors, the proportion of hCG present as acidic variants in serum rose despite lower serum total hCG concentrations. Samples of highly purified AV-hCG (pI, 3.3 to 4.0) obtained from three patients by concentration from urine and isoelectric focusing were evaluated for their disappearance from serum after injection into rats. All AV-hCG samples had decreased clearance rates when compared with that of highly purified hCG (CR123). These data indicate that acidic forms of hCG have a delayed clearance that contributes to the increased proportion of AV-hCG in the serum of patients with hCG-producing neoplasia after therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of 25 cases of long bone adamantinoma is presented. To answer some questions concerning the nature of these tumors, relevant tissue markers were analyzed in seven cases using immunohistochemical assays. This study confirmed the epithelial nature of long bone adamantinomas irrespective of their wide-ranging morphologic patterns that can mimic tumors of various origin. On the basis of distinct radiologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical patterns, a new type of adamantinoma termed \"differentiated adamantinoma\" could be distinguished from the classic long bone adamantinomas. The diagnostic features characteristic of the differentiated adamantinoma include: patient age (first two decades), intracortical location of the entire lesion, uniform predominance of an osteofibrous dysplasia-like pattern, and scattered positivity of epithelial elements for cytokeratin. We postulate that the predominance of an osteofibrous dysplasia-like pattern in differentiated adamantinoma is the result of a secondary reparative process overgrowing matured and regressing tumor tissue. It is possible that this process may lead to the total elimination of recognizable tumor cells from the lesion. Therefore, osteofibrous dysplasia (ossifying fibroma) of long bones, which has a similar anatomic location, age distribution, and radiologic appearance as differentiated adamantinoma, may, in some cases, represent the evolution of an underlying adamantinoma. Our analysis suggests that long bone adamantinoma could be another member of the unique family of tumors that may regress spontaneously.\r"

  ".W": "Intake of vitamin E, total lipids, total cholesterol, and fatty acids were analyzed with the blood levels of vitamin E, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and the serum distribution of fatty acids in a hospital-based population of 120 patients and 109 controls. In regard to nutritional intake, the only significant differences involve saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid consumption, which is more elevated in postmenopausal patients than in postmenopausal controls. Vitamin E and total cholesterol blood levels are significantly higher in patients than in controls, where the difference is that vitamin E is independent from cholesterol level in premenopausal women only. Fatty acid serum distribution is comparable in both samples, with the exception of arachidonic acid, which is significantly lower in premenopausal patients than in premenopausal controls. Two multivariate regression analyses of the plasma vitamin E levels of patients and controls were done with menopausal status and nutrients as independent variables for the first analysis, and with menopausal status and all blood analytes for the second one. The regression coefficients for total cholesterol and triglycerides are statistically significant for both samples, whereas a positive association between vitamin E plasma level and sunflower oil consumption and between vitamin E plasma level and serum linoleic acid distribution is significant for patients only. Furthermore, the multiple regression shows that, when adjusted for analyte variables, plasma vitamin E levels are higher in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. In addition, plasma lipid peroxidation, evaluated by malondialdehyde measurement, is shown to be significantly lower in patients than in controls. Malondialdehyde level is associated with a significant lower odds ratio (OR) after multivariate tertile analysis (OR for the highest tertile: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.89). Together, these findings are consistent with a picture of lower lipid peroxidation in patients than in controls.\r"

  ".W": "The relative prognostic value of the Dukes, Astler, and Coller and TNM staging systems was evaluated for 745 pathologically evaluable patients with rectal cancer enrolled in protocol R-01 of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Projects. All three methods were found to be highly interrelated. However, the magnitude and consistency of prognostic discrimination among stages was best exhibited by the Dukes' and TNM systems. Survival was comparable among patients with Astler and Coller A and B1 and TNM T1N0M0 and T2N0M0 lesions. Since neither method improved on the predictability noted in Dukes' A cases it is suggested that the use of confusing subscripts is unnecessary. On the other hand, striking prognostic discrimination was observed when Dukes' C cases were subdivided according to depth of tumor penetration as proposed by Astler and Coller and designated as C1 and C2. Multivariate analyses revealed this feature to be independent of number of nodal metastases (1-4 versus 5+ positive), their site (near or far from the growth), or degree of tumor differentiation. The site of nodal metastases appeared to be related to numbers of nodal metastases rather than site per se. Considerations of the findings indicate that the Dukes' staging method is the simplest and most consistent algorithm related to prognosis. The only modification that would enhance its value in this regard would be the subdivision of C cases according to the criteria of Astler and Coller rather than that proposed by Dukes himself.\r"

  ".W": "In a homescreening study 235 asymptomatic men, 50 years of age and older without known causes of hematuria, tested their urine each week with a chemical reagent strip for the presence of blood for 1 year. Forty-four men had hematuria at least once, and 31 had a full urologic evaluation. Of these, eight were found to have urinary cancers and seven had nonmalignant diseases warranting immediate treatment. In six of these 15 men (only two with cancer) hematuria occurred in over 1/3 of the testings, and in four hematuria was found on microscopic urinalysis at the time of urologic evaluation. The degree of hematuria was unrelated to the seriousness of its cause. We conclude that in this population hematuria occurs intermittently and when found, regardless of quantity or symptoms, serious underlying pathology must be ruled out. Furthermore, regular hematuria home testing offers a promising means of detecting urinary cancers and other diseases that warrant therapy in asymptomatic men 50 years of age and older.\r"

The positive rate was much higher than that (50%) of the mothers of control HBsAg carrier children (P less than 0.001). The serum HBsAg positive rate was also higher in the siblings of HCC children than that of the control group. On the contrary, the serum HBsAg positive rate was not different between the fathers of HCC children and that of the control group.

These studies were based on Missouri Cancer Registry data for 15,000 white male patients, including 1720 subjects classified as farmers, registered between 1984 and 1988. For each cancer site, all other cancer registrations formed the control group. The largest risks among farmers were found for lip cancer (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99 to 4.73) and cancer of the bone (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 0.66 to 5.81). Elevated risks were observed for several other sites, including the nasal cavity and sinuses (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.54 to 4.70), prostate (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.51), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.85), and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.87 to 2.24). Other smaller elevations in risk were noticed for cancer of the rectum (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.53), liver (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.58 to 2.37), malignant melanoma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.63 to 2.45), kidney (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.65), and leukemia (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.55); however, some of these estimates were imprecise due to small numbers. The overall OR for lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.56). Consistent with previous studies, a decreased risk of lung cancer was observed among farmers (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.76). The current findings are presented in the context of other recent studies, including discussions of possible causes of farming-associated excess cancer risk and possible sources of bias.\r"

There were no remarkable differences in age, sex, and the distribution of bone tumors between Japanese and Western cases. Sixteen cases (47%) diagnosed previously as \"reticulum cell sarcoma\" were reclassified as diffuse NHL of large cell (seven cases), mixed type (four cases), immunoblastic type (three cases), clear cell type (one case), and multilobated type (one case). The cases with small lymphocytic type with plasmacytoid features (lymphoplasmacytic type) were more common in Japan (35% of our cases) than in Western countries. The distribution of histologic subtypes, except for lymphoplasmacytic and T-cell lymphomas, in the current cases was similar to that in Western countries. However, immunohistochemistry showed that Japanese cases contained a much higher frequency of T-cell lymphoma (10% of all cases) than Western cases. Histologic grade according to the Working Formulation correlated well with clinical stage. There may be a tendency towards better prognosis with lower grade tumors, but this was not statistically significant.\r"

Seventy-four percent of the patients were older than 65 years of age. The male to female ratio was 8:1. In all cases, plaques and nodules first appeared in the lower limbs; they were symmetrical in 47% of the cases and ulcerated in 25%. No generalized or epidemic forms were seen. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma concurrent with KS was observed in one case. KS developed several years after treatment for follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in two patients. An angiosarcomatous variant and one fibrosarcomatous change were seen. Ten cases studied for factor VIII expression through the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique were all reactive. We conclude that in Colombia before 1985, KS behaved as a chronic multicentric Stage I disease without a tendency to associate simultaneously with malignant conditions.\r"

For most of the survivors, testis cancer did not lead to unemployment (4.5%), divorce (6.8%), or disabling psychological problems. Multivariate analysis results confirm that cancer survivors report significantly more infertility and sexual performance distress, but not more desire distress, than the control group. Survivors' sexual impairment varied according to treatment received (and therefore histologic factors) and sociodemographic variables. Parental status (not having children) and education (college or less) independently predict infertility distress, whereas education and lower occupational level independently predicted sexual performance distress. Adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES), the men with advanced testis cancer who received chemotherapy and standard retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) had significantly more infertility and performance distress than those men who received other treatments. Neither the treatment or SES variables predicted disrupted relationships or a deteriorated mental outlook. However, men with sexual impairment distress were more likely to report strained relationships and a pessimistic mental outlook. These findings have implications for treatment decisions and can be used to identify subgroups of survivors who could benefit from counseling and sexual rehabilitation services.\r"

The indication for atherectomy was claudication in 114 (87%) and rest pain, gangrene, or ulcer in 17 patients (13%). Atherectomy was successfully performed in 136/139 stenoses (98%) and in 56/56 occluded vessels with or without prior balloon angioplasty. No serious complications resulting in limb loss or emergency vascular surgery were encountered. Histopathology of retrieved specimens showed that 66% had atheromatous plaque, 45% had tunica media, and 30% had a form of thrombus. Material obtained from an occluded vessel was more likely to have thrombus and tunica media present than that from a stenosis (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05, respectively). Early angiographic follow-up (mean time, 17 weeks) showed a relatively low (17%) lesion recurrence rate. Percutaneous atherectomy can be successfully utilized in stenotic and occluded peripheral arteries with good success and no serious complications; stenoses appear to have a low recurrence rate.\r"

A study was performed to test the prediction capabilities of the Gorlin formula, as well as those of the Aaslid and Gabbay formulas for the effective orifice area of a porcine valve of varying degrees of stenosis. Pressure gradient, flow, and valve opening area measurements were performed on Carpentier-Edwards porcine valve prostheses (made stenotic by suturing at the commissures) mounted in the aortic position of an in vitro pulse duplicator. With the known valve orifice area, a discharge coefficient was computed for each of the three orifice area formulas. After some theoretical considerations, it was proposed that the discharge coefficient would be a function of the flow rate through the valve. The discharge coefficient was observed to increase with increasing systolic flow rate. An empirical relationship of the discharge coefficient as a linear function of the systolic flow rate was determined through a regression analysis, with a different relationship for each orifice area formula. Using this relationship in the orifice area formulas improved the accuracy of the prediction of the effective orifice area with all three formulas performing equally well.\r"

Among 704 consecutive procedures performed in 39 transplant recipients (2,842 myocardial samples), endomyocardial biopsy by either the right internal jugular (n = 661) or the femoral venous (n = 43) approach was compared with 243 consecutive procedures performed in nontransplant patients (n = 149 and n = 94, internal jugular and femoral approach, respectively). The internal jugular vein could not be located in only 0.61% (4/661) of heart transplant versus 5% (7/149) of nontransplant procedures (P less than 0.001). Vascular access plus sufficient myocardial sampling was obtained in all but 0.61% (4/661) internal jugular procedures performed in heart transplant patients and in all but 7% (11/149) of those performed in nontransplant patients (P less than 0.0001). (Vascular access was achieved in all femoral venous procedures performed in both transplant and nontransplant patients; sampling was successful after vascular access in all heart transplant recipients and all but two [2.1%] nontransplant procedures.) Cardiac complications occurred in nontransplant patients after one internal jugular procedure (cardiac perforation with tamponade) and after one femoral venous procedure (pericardial effusion). No cardiac complications occurred in transplant recipients, but 2 other complications were observed: One local abscess and one superior vena caval perforation with hemothorax associated with hypotension, both after an internal jugular approach. The overall efficiency (no safety problem; vascular access and adequate sample) was higher among transplant than nontransplant procedures (99% vs 93%, respectively, P less than 0.0001). These observations continue to support routine application of endomyocardial biopsy for monitoring rejection in cardiac transplant patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To gain some insight into inotropic mechanisms, we compared the effects of several classes of inotropic interventions on the isometric twitch and force-velocity properties of isolated rabbit myocardium. Postextrasystolic potentiation was chosen as one of the interventions in the belief that its onset is so rapid that it would be unlikely to cause substantial chemical changes in the contractile proteins and that most of the effects would be due to changes in the level of activation. The effects of a digitalis analogue (acetylstrophanthidin), an adrenergic agent (isoproterenol), and a methylxanthine (caffeine) were then compared with those of postextrasystolic potentiation. The conditions were chosen so that each agent caused a twofold increase in twitch force. Acetylstrophanthidin and postextrasystolic potentiation caused twitch force to increase with only a slight (11%) decrease in time to peak force. Isoproterenol caused the peak of the twitch to occur substantially (40%) earlier with marked abbreviation of the twitch. Caffeine had the opposite effect: time to peak force was delayed (by 60%), and the twitch was markedly prolonged. In contrast to the marked differences in the time course of the twitch, there was no significant difference between the instantaneous force-velocity curves obtained with the different interventions. All four interventions caused maximum velocity to increase slightly (1-9%) and maximum power to increase only slightly more than twitch force (5-21%). All of the changes observed can be accounted for by changes in activation, either by an increase in the amount of calcium released into the myofilament space or by a change in the sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium. There was no need to postulate direct changes in the contractile machinery to account for these results.\r"

  ".U": "90030744\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether anemia-induced cardiac hypertrophy affects ventricular size and shape and the component structures of the capillary network of the left and right ventricles, young male rats were fed an iron- and copper-deficient diet for 7 weeks. By that time, blood hemoglobin content fell to 5 +/- 1 g/dl, and packed cell volume fell to 18 +/- 3%. To further characterize the implications of anemia, red blood cell number, hemoglobin corpuscular content, systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood viscosity were measured. Moreover, the changes in ventricular weights were analyzed in terms of the alterations in ventricular wall area and ventricular wall thickness to establish the impact of the elevation in load associated with a high cardiac output state on ventricular remodeling. The quantitative properties of the capillary circulation were also examined biventricularly by low power electron microscopic morphometry to evaluate the adaptive growth potential of the coronary microcirculation in this form of cardiac hypertrophy. Anemia was found to interfere with the production of red blood cells and their mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and resulted in a 40% reduction in blood viscosity and a 12% and 27% decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. The changes in heart rate were not statistically significant. In comparison with control animals, heart weight increased by 50%, but the enlargement in right ventricular mass (65%) was greater than that of the left ventricle (47%). Ventricular hypertrophy occurred with increases in wall area and wall thickness although the former increased consistently more than the latter in either ventricle. Tissue growth was accompanied by a 60% lengthening of the capillary network, which in combination with an increase in capillary diameter resulted in a 65% and 34% expansion in capillary luminal volume and 56% and 20% larger luminal surface density in the left and right sides of the heart, respectively. In conclusion, hypochromic microcytic anemia leads to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy with a significant amount of capillary proliferation that may tend to protect the myocardium from the increased potential for ischemic injury.\r"

  ".W": "Using mice transgenic for the growth hormone gene (TGHM), we have studied the effects of a systemic elevation of growth hormone on vascular growth with the aim of investigating the role of vascular mass changes in producing hypertension. In contrast to human acromegaly or gigantism, there was no elevation of blood pressure in TGHM, but there were significant increases in vascular wall mass. In accordance with a presumably increased perfusion of larger organs, the medial cross-sectional areas of thoracic aorta and mesenteric resistance vessels were greater in the TGHM. These differences could be normalized in the aorta by body weight and in the mesenteric vessel by small intestine weight. Furthermore, the brain was not significantly heavier in the TGHM, and their carotid and cerebral vessels also were not larger. Wall-to-lumen ratios were similar in the aorta, carotid, and middle cerebral arteries suggesting that wall stress was the controlling factor in wall thickness. Surprisingly, the mesenteric vessels had increased wall-to-lumen ratio, which was similar to that seen in hypertensive vascular remodeling but in a normotensive animal. In an attempt to explain this finding it was noted that the pattern of mesenteric vascular networks and even organized structure within the vessel wall itself appeared to be fixed, perhaps by genetic mechanisms. Thus, vascular network structure may be a potentially limiting factor in the ability of the vessel wall to remodel and may have been responsible for the greater wall-to-lumen ratio in TGHM mesenteric vessels. A similar situation in human acromegaly or gigantism could result in a circulation marginally able to correct for other demands on blood flow resulting in about one third of cases being hypertensive.\r"

Sequence analysis demonstrated varying homologies with TnC complementary DNA clones isolated from developing chick skeletal muscle. Using pCTnC1 as a hybridization probe, we have determined that cardiac TnC is constitutively expressed in both atria and ventricles of the developing and adult heart. These data along with previous immunochemical studies of TnC expression demonstrate that the slow skeletal and cardiac muscle isoform is the only TnC expressed in the heart. In contrast, expression of slow skeletal and cardiac muscle TnC is developmentally regulated in skeletal muscles of the chicken. The tightly controlled expression of slow skeletal and cardiac muscle TnC in the varying myocyte types of the heart suggests a physiologically significant role of this regulatory protein.\r"

We examined the blockade of single cardiac sodium channels by lidocaine and its hydrophobic derivative RAD-242 in rabbit ventricular myocytes. Experiments were performed in cell-attached and inside-out patches. Use-dependent block was assessed with trains of ten 200-msec pulses with interpulse intervals of 500 msec and test potentials of -60 to -40 mV. Single-channel kinetics sometimes showed time-dependent change in the absence of drug. During exposure to 80 microM lidocaine, use-dependent block during the trains was associated with a decrease in the average number of openings per step. At -60 mV, mean open time was not significantly changed (control, 1.4 +/- 0.6 msec; lidocaine, 1.2 +/- 0.3 msec, p greater than 0.05). Greater block developed during trains of 200-msec pulses compared with trains of 20-msec pulses at the same interpulse interval at test potentials during which openings were uncommon later than 20 msec (-50 and -40 mV). Prolonged bursts of channels showing slow-gating kinetics were observed both in control and the presence of 80 microM lidocaine. However, lidocaine may decrease the late sodium current by altering the kinetics of slow gating. The hydrophobic lidocaine derivative RAD-242, which has a 10-fold greater lipid solubility than lidocaine, decreased the peak averaged current during pulse train stimulation by 60% without a change in the mean open time. Our results suggest that the major effect of lidocaine during use-dependent block involves the interaction with a nonconducting state of the sodium channel followed by a failure to open during subsequent depolarization.\r"

  ".U": "90030752\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the degree, time sequence, and biochemical correlates of hypothermic protection against ischemic acute renal failure. Rats subjected to 40 minutes of bilateral renal artery occlusion (RAO) were made mildly hypothermic (32 degrees-33 degrees C, by cold saline peritoneal lavage) during the following time periods: 1) RAO only, 2) reperfusion only (beginning at 0, 15, 30, or 60 minutes after RAO and maintained for 45 minutes), or 3) during and after (0-45 minutes) RAO. Continuously normothermic (37 degrees C) RAO rats served as controls. The control rats developed severe acute renal failure (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], 95 +/- 4 mg/dl; creatinine, 2.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl; and extensive tubular necrosis at 24 hours). Hypothermia confined to RAO was highly protective (BUN, 33 +/- 5 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.62 +/- 0.07 mg/dl; and minimal necrosis). Hypothermia partially preserved ischemic renal adenylate high-energy phosphate (ATP and ADP), increased AMP and inosine monophosphate concentrations, and lessened hypoxanthine/xanthine buildup (assessed at end of RAO). Hypothermia confined to the reflow period (beginning at 0, 15, and 30 minutes) was only mildly protective (e.g., BUN, 58-63 mg/dl); the degree of protection did not differ according to the time of hypothermic onset. Lowering reflow temperature to 26 degrees C had no added benefit. Hypothermia that started at 60 minutes after RAO conferred no protection. Combining ischemic and postischemic hypothermia abolished all renal failure (assessed at 24 hours). This study offers the following conclusions: Mild hypothermia can totally prevent experimental ischemic acute renal failure. Hypothermia is highly effective during ischemia, and it is mildly protective during early reflow; these benefits are additive. During early reflow, hypothermic protection is not critically time dependent. By 60 minutes of reflow, no effect is elicited; this absence of effect possibly signals completion of the reperfusion injury process. Hypothermia's protective effects may be mediated, in part, by improvements in renal adenine nucleotide content and, possibly, by decreasing postischemic oxidant stress.\r"

  ".W": "Extent, time course, and underlying mechanisms of the negative inotropic effect of ryanodine were examined in 22 length-clamped ferret right ventricular papillary muscles paced 12/min at 25 degrees C. After 60 minutes of exposure to 5 microM ryanodine a new steady state was attained with developed forces averaging 10-15% of maximum twitch force. Ryanodine does not pharmacologically excise the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in this preparation. Ryanodine does not appreciably inhibit the ability of the SR to take up Ca2+ as evidenced by the potentiated beats obtained after a short pause that are nearly as large after ryanodine as before. On comparing equipotent beats before and after ryanodine, we found that ryanodine actually increases the rate at which Ca2+ is released during the twitch if the SR Ca2+ stores are equal or similar. The evidence for this conclusion is a larger maximum rate of tension rise and briefer time to peak tension after ryanodine. Since ryanodine increases the time that SR Ca2+ release channels are open and decreases their conductivity, it must follow that the former effect predominates over the latter in our experiments. Ryanodine increases the leakiness of the SR during diastole probably by inhibiting closure of SR Ca2+ release channels. The evidence for this conclusion is as follows: the early peak of the restitution curves after ryanodine, the brevity of the time required for a rested state contraction after ryanodine, and the small amplitude of the steady-state contraction at a rate of 12/min. The SR leaks even in the absence of ryanodine, but if external Ca2+ is so high that Ca2+ loss from the cell is slowed or a Ca2+ leak into the cell through the sarcolemma cancels the SR leak, then the effects of the SR leak are minimized. The evidence for this conclusion is the time required for rested-state contraction to occur or the slope of the descending limb of restitution curve; however, in presence of ryanodine even high external Ca2+ cannot prevent rapid depletion of SR Ca2+ stores. Even though we have presented evidence for a mechanism whereby ryanodine increases the number of open SR Ca2+ release channels in both systole and diastole, we do not mean to imply that most of them stay open in diastole; the SR would leak too fast to accumulate any Ca2+ for the potentiated beat. Thus, probably most channels close after being open a certain length of time, even in the presence of ryanodine.\r"

The epimyocardial coronary microcirculation was observed through an intravital microscope by stroboscopic epi-illumination in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Aortic pressure and heart rate were controlled by an aortic snare and atrioventricular sequential pacing, respectively, during experimental procedures. In group 1 (n = 15), coronary arterial microvessel diameters were measured under control condition and during rapid pacing at 300 beats/min, which doubled MVO2. Increases in MVO2 caused heterogeneous vasodilation in coronary arterial microvessels (40-380 microns). There was an inverse relation between control diameter and percent increase in diameter. In group 2 (n = 15) or group 3 (n = 10), adenosine or dipyridamole was infused intravenously to increase myocardial perfusion to the same level as that obtained with rapid pacing. Adenosine and dipyridamole did not change MVO2. Adenosine and dipyridamole also caused heterogeneous vasodilation, but the effects of adenosine and dipyridamole were restricted to arterial microvessels smaller than 150 microns. From these results, we conclude that increases in MVO2 produce widespread but heterogeneous vasodilation, that is, greater dilation in smaller arterial microvessels. Comparable increases in coronary flow produced by increasing MVO2 or endogenous and exogenous adenosine do not produce identical changes in the distribution of coronary microvascular resistance.\r"

RAC109-I and RAC109-II produced similar levels of tonic block, but RAC109-I produced a significantly larger use-dependent block on repetitive pulsing to potentials positive to -60 mV. Definition of the time courses of block development at -20 mV and recovery at -140 and -160 mV indicated that RAC109-I had a higher affinity for activated and inactivated channels and dissociated more slowly at hyperpolarized potentials compared with RAC109-II. Removal of fast inactivation by alpha-chymotrypsin intensified tonic block but did not reduce use-dependent block by RAC109-I; this finding suggests that channel inactivation is not necessary for use-dependent block. The guarded-receptor model was used to calculate apparent rate constants of drug binding and unbinding. According to the model, RAC109-I and RAC109-II have significantly different unbinding rate constants for channels when they exist predominantly in rested, activated, or inactivated states, as well as significantly different binding rate constants when channels are activated. However, the apparent rates of drug binding to closed (rested and inactivated) channels are not significantly different for the two isomers; this finding indicates that drug binding to closed channels is not markedly stereospecific, in contrast to unbinding. The effects of RAC109 stereoisomers on cardiac sodium channels were also qualitatively similar to those previously reported in nerve; these findings suggest that the binding sites for local anesthetics in both tissue types have a similar structural topography.\r"

The model incorporated a stimulation-mediated depletion of the releasable pool of acetylcholine (ACh) in the nerve endings, the in vitro reaction kinetics of acetylcholinesterase, and the electrical activity of a pacemaker cell with six membrane ionic currents. SCL increased linearly with the frequency of simulated vagal stimulation, as it does in animal experiments, because the concentration of ACh in the neuroeffector junction [( ACh]) saturated as the frequency of stimulation was increased and because SCL increased geometrically in response to increases in [ACh]. The dependence of SCL on the timing of vagal stimulation in the cardiac cycle resulted, in part, from the dependence of [ACh] on SCL. Simulated vagal stimulation entrained the sinus node because the rate of activation and inactivation of ACh-activated K+ channels depended only weakly on membrane potential during diastolic depolarization. SCL increased geometrically with [ACh], because 1) during diastolic depolarization, the amplitude of the ACh-activated K+ current was approximately equal to the amplitude of the sum of the other ionic currents, 2) [ACh] was low enough to saturate neither acetylcholinesterase nor the cellular system that activates the ACh-activated K+ channels, 3) the pacemaker cell membrane behaved electrotonically like a capacitor, and 4) the sum of all the ionic currents increased linearly with the amplitude of the ACh-activated K+ current.\r"

They can be revealed by cutting up the organ in such a way as to reveal the zero-stress configuration. The function of the organ depends on the residual strain. For a blood vessel, the zero-stress configuration is very different from that of the no-load condition, and it changes over time when the physical stress acting on the vessel is changed. Data on rat aorta are presented. Physical changes were obtained by constricting the aorta at the celiac trunk level with a band of metal. Banding causes an increase of blood pressure and hypertrophy of the vessel in the upper body and a transient decrease of blood pressure in the lower body. If the aorta is cut transversely into rings and each ring is cut radially, it will open up into a noncircular arc, which may be characterized by its opening angle. It is shown that the opening angle varies systematically along the aorta and that it changes significantly together with changes of blood pressure and hypertrophy. In the ascending aorta, the opening angle increased from 171 degrees and to 214 degrees in 4 days after banding, then decreased gradually to an asymptotic value of 126 degrees in 40 days. At other sections, the swing of opening angle is smaller. The implications are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Phase-locking behavior and irregular dynamics were studied in a mathematical model of the sinus node driven with repetitive vagal input. The central region of the sinus node was simulated as a 15 x 15 array of resistively coupled pacemakers with each cell randomly assigned one of 10 intrinsic cycle lengths (range 290-390 msec). Coupling of the pacemakers resulted in their mutual entrainment to a common frequency and the emergence of a dominant pacemaker region. Repetitive acetylcholine (ACh; vagal) pulses were applied to a randomly selected 60% of the cells. Over a wide range of stimulus intensities and basic cycle lengths, such perturbations resulted in a large variety of stimulus/response patterns, including phase locking (1:1, 3:2, 2:1, etc.) and irregular (i.e., chaotic) dynamics. At a low ACh concentration (1 microM), the patterns followed the typical Farey sequence of phase-locked behavior. At a higher concentration (5 microM), period doubling and aperiodic patterns were found. When a single pacemaker cell was perturbed with repetitive ACh pulses, qualitatively similar results were obtained. In both types of simulation, chaotic behavior was investigated using phase-plane (orbital) plots, Poincare mapping, and return mapping. Period-doubling bifurcations (2:2, 4:4, and 8:8) were found temporally and spatially within the array. Under certain conditions of stimulation, the attractor in the return map during chaotic activity of the single cell resembled the Lorenz tent map. However, when electrical coupling between cells was allowed, the interactions with neighboring cells exhibiting chaotic dynamics resulted in characteristic alterations of the attractor geometry. Our results suggest that irregular dynamics obeying the rules derived from other chaotic systems are present during vagal stimulation of the sinus node. In addition, application of the same analytical tools to the analysis of simulation of reflex vagal control of sinus rate suggests that chaotic dynamics can be obtained in the physiologically relevant case of the baroreceptor reflex loop. These results may provide insight into the mechanisms of dynamic vagal control of heart rate and may help to provide insights into clinically relevant disturbances of cardiac rate and rhythm.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic GMP (cGMP) kinase is intimately involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone. Its tissue concentration was determined in normotensive and hypertensive rats by use of monospecific anti-cGMP kinase antibodies. Hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats and renovascular (Goldblatt II) hypertensive rats contained half the concentration of cGMP kinase than those of the respective normotensive animals. The increase in blood pressure and the resulting left ventricular hypertrophy were correlated inversely with the left ventricular cGMP kinase concentration. This decrease was specific for the left ventricle and was not observed in other tissues. In addition, the cardiac concentration of cGMP kinase was unchanged in hyperthyroid animals that had comparable left ventricular hypertrophy and mild hypertension. This suggested that in severe renovascular hypertension the decrease in cardiac cGMP kinase concentration is caused by a relative lack of cardiac vessel growth during the development of hypertrophy. In agreement with this conclusion, immunohistochemistry of cardiac cross sections showed that cGMP kinase was exclusively located in cardiac vessels. In support of this localization, the maximal arterial blood flow of heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney correlated excellently with the cGMP kinase content of the respective organ. These results suggest that the cGMP kinase concentration of nonsmooth muscle tissues depends on the amount of organ-specific vascular smooth muscle and may be used as an index for the vascularization of these organs.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the Fenn effect in 12 excised cross-circulated dog left ventricles in control contractility and in a contractility enhanced by dobutamine or depressed by propranolol. The additional oxygen consumption (Vo2) in an ejecting contraction compared with that found in an isovolumic contraction at a comparable end-systolic pressure was considered to constitute the cardiac Fenn effect. We examined whether this load-dependent Vo2 could be reconciled with the linear relation between Vo2 and pressure-volume area (PVA) common for both ejecting and isovolumic contractions that has so far been consistently observed and was presently confirmed. PVA is a specific area in the pressure-volume diagram, represents the total mechanical energy generated by each contraction, and consists of external mechanical work (EW) and mechanical potential energy. Because potential energy is common in the isovolumic and ejecting contractions producing the same end-systolic pressure, PVA of the ejecting contraction is greater by EW than that of the isovolumic contraction. Despite this difference in PVA by EW, the Vo2-PVA relation was always linear and load independent regardless of the isovolumic and ejecting contractions in a given heart in any given contractile state. By contrast, the upward convex Vo2-end-systolic pressure relation was higher for ejecting contractions than the downward convex Vo2-end-systolic pressure relation for isovolumic contractions in each contractile state. The difference of Vo2 between the ejecting and isovolumic contractions was proportional to EW at comparable end-systolic pressure. The slope of the additional Vo2 of ejecting contractions plotted against their EW had a slope close to the slope of the Vo2-PVA relation. Thus, the load-independent linear Vo2-PVA relation can be reconciled with the cardiac Fenn effect.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that intravenous infusion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) inhibits sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in rabbits by its action at the brainstem. This study aimed to determine, first, whether this action of AVP depended on functioning baroreflex mechanisms. The second aim was to determine the role of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in mediating this action of AVP. Experiments were performed in rabbits anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Intravenous infusions of AVP (1, 3, and 10 mU/kg/min) resulted in progressive inhibition of renal SNA in rabbits with intact arterial baroreceptors and vagal afferents as well as in rabbits with sinoaortic denervation and bilateral vagotomy. The magnitudes of renal SNA inhibition evoked with AVP were comparable in the two groups. Renal SNA inhibition evoked with AVP at doses of 1 and 3 mU/kg/min in rabbits after sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy was totally blocked by chemical lesions with kainic acid of the bilateral NTS or the area postrema. Lesions of the NTS or the area postrema markedly attenuated (by about 60%) but did not totally block the response evoked with AVP at a dose of 10 mU/kg/min. AVP microinjected directly into the NTS did not evoke changes in renal SNA or arterial pressure, whereas AVP microinjected into the area postrema suppressed renal SNA. These results suggest that intravenous AVP at lower doses inhibited renal SNA by causing excitation of the NTS neurons, and this action of AVP did not depend on functioning baroreflex mechanisms. The second suggestion is that the NTS was unlikely to be the site where AVP directly interacted but instead received a neural connection, presumably from the area postrema, where AVP might directly interact.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ischemia on the function of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was assessed by the calcium uptake rate of rat whole-heart homogenates in the presence of 10 mM oxalate. Previous studies have shown that this uptake is restricted to the SR. The contribution of the ryanodine-sensitive fractions of the SR to the total homogenate uptake was assessed by using 20 microM ruthenium red and 625 microM ryanodine to close the SR calcium release channel under previously established optimal conditions. Global ischemia of 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes depressed homogenate calcium uptake rate 19 +/- 2%, 50 +/- 6%, 65 +/- 3%, and 81 +/- 5%, respectively. This decrease was not observed when the uptake rates were measured after closure of the calcium channel with ryanodine or ruthenium red. Similar results were obtained with a Langendorff in vitro perfusion preparation, in which calcium uptake was decreased 35 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 8%, 58 +/- 7%, and 64 +/- 4% after 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes of ischemia, but no significant decrease was observed when homogenate uptake rates were measured in the presence of ryanodine. Thus, ischemia caused a depression in the calcium uptake rate of cardiac SR only when this activity was measured in the absence of SR calcium channel blockers. Reperfusion of ischemic hearts in a Langendorff preparation resulted in recovery of homogenate calcium uptake activity that correlated well with the return to sinus rhythm of the reperfused hearts. These reperfused hearts showed no change in the calcium uptake rate measured in the presence of ryanodine. These results suggest that the decrease in homogenate calcium uptake caused by ischemia is not due to a defect in calcium pumping capabilities but is due to an increased efflux through the ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channel of cardiac SR.\r"

  ".W": "The role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the development of catecholamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo was investigated. Rats received a constant intravenous infusion of norepinephrine or sodium chloride (control) for 3 days. The norepinephrine infusion was combined with the alpha-blocker prazosin, the beta-blocker metoprolol, or both blockers. For modulation of the work load of the heart, the calcium channel blocker verapamil was added to the norepinephrine infusion. A further group of animals was treated with the alpha-adrenergic stimulator norfenephrine, which also was combined with prazosin or verapamil. Norepinephrine induced significant increases in mean aortic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, heart rate, and total peripheral resistance. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was significantly elevated and was accompanied by an increase in the RNA concentration and the RNA/DNA ratio. Prazosin as well as metoprolol partially antagonized the increase in left ventricular weight and RNA concentration, whereas simultaneous prazosin and metoprolol treatment prevented the norepinephrine-induced alterations. Although combination of norepinephrine with verapamil resulted in considerable reduction of all functional parameters, the development of cardiac hypertrophy and the elevated RNA/DNA ratio were not significantly influenced. Stimulation of alpha-receptors with norfenephrine elicited an increase in total peripheral resistance and in left ventricular weight, which was abolished by prazosin. Verapamil did not affect the norfenephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, although it normalized essentially all functional parameters. Thus, the rapid development of cardiac hypertrophy in the norepinephrine model seems to be directly mediated by stimulation of myocardial alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors rather than by hemodynamic changes.\r"

  ".W": "Although slow conduction is a requirement for the preparation of sustained reentry, it alone is not sufficient for the initiation of reentry. Additionally, unidirectional block and recovery of excitability distal to the site of block must occur. Thus, a comprehensive description of the electrophysiological determinants of reentry must explain both slow conduction and unidirectional block. Although there is a growing body of research exploring the influence of axial resistivity and anisotropy on slow conduction, somewhat less is known about the relation of axial resistivity to spatial dispersion of action potential duration, a condition favorable to the development of unidirectional block. We hypothesized that when cells are well coupled, local differences in intrinsic action potential duration are not evident and that, as axial resistivity increases, local variation in action potential duration becomes manifest. We tested this hypothesis in a numerical model of electrical propagation in a grid of resistively coupled ionic current sources simulating a sheet of ventricular myocardium. Spatial dispersion of intrinsic action potential duration was simulated by varying the magnitude of the fully activated slow inward conductance in Beeler-Reuter membrane ionic kinetics. By then altering coupling resistance, we showed that dispersion of manifest action potential duration is masked in the setting of normal low-resistance cellular coupling and unmasked by increased axial resistance. When nonuniform anisotropy was simulated, dramatic pacing-site-dependent changes in both the pattern of activation and dispersion of action potential duration were noted. These findings may be important in understanding the mechanism of reentrant tachycardia initiation in the border zone of chronic, healed myocardial infarctions where evidence suggests that abnormal cellular coupling is the predominant electrophysiological derangement. In this study, we have shown, using a detailed ionic current-based model of cardiac electrical propagation, that changes in axial resistivity can modulate how spatial dispersion of intrinsic action potential duration is manifest.\r"

  ".W": "To prevent dissection injury when cutting strip preparations from human left ventricular papillary muscle tissue, dissections were carried out with 2,3-butanedione monoxime (30 mM) added to Krebs-Ringer solution and followed by washout with normal solution. Eleven muscle strip preparations were dissected from left ventricular papillary muscle tissue of five patients undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery. The average muscle strip length was 6.8 +/- 1.4 mm, and cross-section area was 0.49 +/- 0.16 mm2. Peak twitch tension was 2.02 +/- 1.33 g/mm2 and ranged from 0.67 to 5.5 g/mm2 at an extracellular calcium concentration of 2.5 mM (21 degrees C, 0.16 Hz). In one muscle strip, which was stored in Krebs-Ringer plus 2,3-butanedione monoxime solution for 20 hours, peak twitch tension in normal Krebs-Ringer solution was 1.85 g/mm2. When temperature was increased from 21 degrees C, there was a continuous increase in peak twitch tension (by 38%) up to about 28 degrees C; then peak twitch tension decreased so that at 37 degrees C (n = 3) average peak twitch tension was lower than at 21 degrees C by 47%. The force-frequency relation exhibited a broad force plateau between 40 and 120 beats/min at 37 degrees C. The plateau was markedly narrowed at 30 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Thermopile heat measurements revealed appropriate waveform characteristics in high-resolution single-beat heat records indicating minimal surface cell damage. Thus, cardioplegia with 2,3-butanedione monoxime protects human left ventricular myocardium from dissection injury facilitating dissection and preservation of strip preparations with extraordinarily low cross-sectional areas and high peak twitch tensions. These preparations are suitable for myothermal and mechanical measurements.\r"

Specific binding of antibody to the cytoplasmic surfaces of ultrastructurally identified gap junctions was confirmed with electron microscopy. Light microscopic morphometric analysis of immunostained sections in five separate experiments revealed a mean gap junction surface density of 0.0052 micron2/micron3 myocyte volume, which is consistent with previously reported values determined by use of quantitative electron microscopy. This new method permits quantitative determinations of gap junction surface density and distribution in relatively large heterogeneous areas of myocardium in which ultrastructural morphometry would be impractical. This approach should facilitate analysis of the relation between potential alterations in electrical coupling of myocytes and abnormalities of myocardial conduction occurring at the macroscopic scale in regions such as structurally heterogeneous infarct border zones.\r"

Hearts from six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and one patient with ischemic heart disease were found to contain virus RNA. Serology revealed that only one patient (dilated cardiomyopathy group) was positive for coxsackievirus B-specific IgM but negative for virus RNA in the myocardium. Quantitation of leukocytes and T-lymphocytes in the myocardium and expression of major histocompatibility locus antigens revealed no significant differences associated with persistence of virus RNA. These data demonstrate that enterovirus RNA persists in myocardium of a significant proportion of patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy in the absence of a continuing cell-mediated or humoral immune response.\r"

Twelve of 24 analyzed variables were significantly associated with mortality. Those factors, which were independently predictive of mortality by Cox regression analysis, were persistent ST depression (p = 0.0009), a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) (p = 0.0069), older age (p = 0.0128), and ST elevation at hospital discharge (p = 0.0173). In-hospital reinfarction achieved borderline significance (p = 0.0512). Mortality during the follow-up period was 5.5% in patients with no ST depression, 10.1% in those with ST depression at baseline or discharge, and 22.2% in patients with ST depression at baseline and discharge (i.e., \"persistent\" ST depression). The age-adjusted risk of mortality for patients with persistent ST depression, discharge-ST elevation, and CHF was 13.99 times as high as was the risk for patients with no ST depression, no discharge-ST elevation, and no CHF. Of the 483 patients with complete electrocardiographic data at both baseline and discharge, 203 (42%) could be stratified into a high risk population with a risk ratio for 1-year mortality more than sevenfold that of patients with no risk factors. Although persistent ST depression was significantly associated with several measures of structural left ventricular damage, the independent significance of ST depression persisted even after adjusting for these factors. The independent predictors of late reinfarction (persistent ST depression, p = 0.0058; Killip class II or III, p = 0.0106; and left ventricular hypertrophy, p = 0.0470) permitted a similar risk stratification. We conclude that 1) easily identified clinical and electrocardiographic factors permit stratification of patients with non-Q wave infarction into high-risk subsets who may benefit from aggressive therapy; 2) ST depression is a highly significant and independent predictor of poor prognosis; and 3) the powerful predictive value of persistent ST depression suggests that non-Q wave myocardial infarction patients with this depression should be viewed as potentially high-risk patients who may be candidates for additional noninvasive testing or early coronary angiography.\r"

In 49 patients (84%), the hypertensive vascular disease involved predominantly or exclusively muscular pulmonary arteries and arterioles. In each of these 49 patients, pulmonary artery medial hypertrophy was observed, and in 48 patients, it was also associated with intimal or luminal lesions. On the basis of the predominant histopathologic features, 25 of the 48 patients were classified as having pulmonary arteriopathy with plexiform lesions characterized by a combination of concentric laminar intimal fibrosis, eccentric intimal fibrosis, and plexiform lesions; in nine of these 25, recanalized thrombi were also present. Pulmonary arteriopathy with thrombotic lesions, defined by the presence of both eccentric intimal fibrosis and recanalized thrombi but without plexiform lesions, was observed in 19 patients. Intimal fibrosis, either concentric or eccentric, without plexiform or thrombotic lesions was found in four patients. Among the remaining nine patients in the Registry, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was present in seven and chronic pulmonary venous hypertension in one. Pulmonary blood vessels were microscopically normal in a lung biopsy specimen from another patient. In general, patients with plexiform lesions and those with veno-occlusive disease had a much poorer prognosis than patients with thrombotic lesions. The present study shows the existence of several distinct histopathologic patterns of pulmonary vascular disease in individuals with primary pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by standardized clinical and laboratory criteria.\r"

In 16 patients, lung biopsy material was related to the hemodynamic studies; in nine patients, including six who had undergone open lung biopsy, the hemodynamic studies were related to the pathologic changes found at autopsy. Histologic specimens from all 19 patients were evaluated qualitatively and sorted into three subsets of hypertensive pulmonary arteriopathy: medial hypertrophy (with minimal intimal proliferation), arteriopathy with plexiform lesions (associated predominantly with concentric laminar intimal proliferation and fibrosis), and arteriopathy with microthrombotic lesions (associated predominantly with eccentric intimal proliferation and fibrosis). The 16 lung biopsies were also quantitated by morphometric techniques. Using a decrease in calculated pulmonary vascular resistance of more than 30% accompanied by a decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure of at least 10% to define vasodilation, only four patients were responders. The patients varied considerably in their responses to different vasodilator agents. Patients with similar clinical and hemodynamic profiles differed considerably with respect to the nature of their pulmonary vascular obstructive lesions and their responses to vasodilator agents. Qualitative histologic examination of lung tissue did not provide a basis for predicting how individual patients would respond to vasodilator agents. However, quantitative morphologic analysis of the initial open lung biopsy specimens did prove helpful in predicting acute responsiveness to vasodilator agents and the subsequent clinical course of these patients with unexplained (primary) pulmonary hypertension. An intimal area of more than 18% of the vascular cross-sectional area had an 85% predictive value for identifying the patients who did poorly during the first 36 months of follow-up.\r"

We tested the efficacy of a previously developed CPR message using a recording mannikin in a high stress, simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Community volunteers were unaware they would perform CPR until immediately before each trial. Performance of volunteers without prior CPR training (group A, n = 65) who received telephone instruction was compared with that of previously trained volunteers (group B, n = 43) who received the same message. Performances of both groups were also compared with a third group (group C, n = 43) composed of previously trained volunteers who did not receive the message. Quality of CPR was graded by three CPR instructors using explicit criteria. Printout strips from the recording mannikins were also analyzed. Evaluators were unaware of the training status of volunteers. The three groups were of comparable sex, race, and educational level, but group C was significantly younger than groups A and B (31.7 vs. 37.7 years, p less than 0.001). Because of the time required for telephone instruction, groups A and B started chest compressions a mean of 4.0 minutes after collapse compared with 1.2 minutes for group C (p less than 0.0001). We found that the previously untrained volunteers of group A performed CPR of an overall quality comparable to that performed by previously trained members of group C. Group A performed chest compressions significantly better than group C (p less than 0.02) but had greater problems performing effective ventilations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to blunt maximal coronary flow after brief coronary occlusion and during pharmacologic coronary dilation in animals. This property, if present in humans, would result in a reduction in coronary flow reserve in the absence of intrinsic abnormalities of the coronary circulation. A reduction of maximal vasodilator capacity by calcium channel antagonists could also constitute an important anti-ischemic mechanism of action of these agents. To evaluate the effect of calcium channel antagonists on coronary flow reserve in awake humans, we measured coronary flow reserve using the coronary Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine at baseline and after diltiazem administered by intravenous (125 or 250 micrograms/kg bolus, 5 micrograms/kg/min infusion, n = 8) or intracoronary (150-600 micrograms bolus, n = 10) routes. Intravenous diltiazem reduced heart rate from 77 +/- 18 to 72 +/- 17 beats/min (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.005) and reduced mean arterial pressure from 96 +/- 11 to 86 +/- 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). Intravenous diltiazem resulted in a small decrease in coronary flow reserve (peak-to-resting flow velocity ratio) from 3.9 +/- 1.2 to 3.6 +/- 1.1 (p less than 0.01). After intracoronary diltiazem, mean arterial pressure was unchanged (control 99 +/- 12 mm Hg, diltiazem 97 +/- 13 mm Hg), and heart rate was maintained constant by atrial pacing. Coronary flow reserve was unchanged at 3.8 +/- 0.9 at baseline and after intracoronary diltiazem. Thus, treatment with diltiazem does not invalidate the measurement of coronary flow reserve for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, these results suggest that attenuation of maximal coronary dilation by diltiazem is not a mechanism responsible for its antianginal effects.\r"

  ".U": "90030803\r", 
  ".W": "In most patients, the clinical effects of therapy with encainide are mediated by the generation of the active metabolites O-desmethyl encainide and 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide (MODE). Data from in vitro and animal studies have indicated that MODE has electrophysiologic and pharmacokinetic features that make its further evaluation desirable; in earlier studies, we found that MODE suppressed chronic high-frequency nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias at plasma concentrations of 50-160 ng/ml. We now report the clinical electrophysiology, antiarrhythmic activity, and pharmacokinetics of MODE in 17 patients with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in whom programmed electrical stimulation was performed before drug administration and after one or two sequences of loading and maintenance infusions of MODE. Because the relation between plasma concentration and effect had been incompletely defined, a dose-titration approach was adopted: available pharmacokinetic data were used to construct loading and maintenance infusion regimens that were predicted to attain low plasma concentrations in initial patients while higher infusion rates were evaluated in subsequent patients. MODE prevented VT induction in three of 17 patients and VT cycle length was increased by greater than or equal to 100 msec in a further seven of 17; most responses to MODE occurred at plasma concentrations greater than 556 ng/ml (greater than 1 SD above mean plasma MODE during encainide therapy). Response to MODE did not predict subsequent response to oral therapy with encainide. MODE increased intracardiac conduction times, QT intervals during atrial and ventricular pacing, and right ventricular effective refractory periods (RVERP); changes in RVERP were most prominent at rapid pacing rates, while changes in intracardiac conduction were rate-independent at cycle lengths between 400 and 600 msec. Plasma MODE concentrations measured during electrophysiology study correlated well with those predicted by the pharmacokinetic simulations (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001). Serial plasma sampling after programmed electrical stimulation indicated a minimum MODE elimination half-life of 8.2 +/- 5.4 hours. Side effects were confined to three instances of asymptomatic conduction system depression in subjects with latent conduction system disturbances. We conclude that MODE slows intracardiac conduction, delays repolarization, and can suppress or substantially modify inducible VT. Moreover, it was only with the adoption of the dose-titration strategy that we were able to safely demonstrate that plasma MODE concentrations higher than those routinely observed during encainide therapy were required to substantially alter cardiac electrophysiology.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiologic studies (EPS) were performed in 155 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Indications for EPS were cardiac arrest in 22 patients, syncope in 55 patients, presyncope in 37 patients, asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 24 patients, palpitations in 10 patients, and a strong family history of sudden cardiac death in seven patients. Thirty-five (23%) patients had significant resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Electrophysiologic abnormalities were present in 126 (81%) patients. A high prevalence of abnormal sinus-node function (66%) and His-Purkinje (HV) conduction (30%) was noted. The most commonly induced supraventricular arrhythmias were atrial reentrant tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (10% and 11% of patients, respectively). Accessory atrioventricular pathways were present in seven (5%) patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) induced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 22 (14%) patients and sustained ventricular arrhythmia in 66 (43%) patients. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was polymorphic VT in 48 (73%) patients, monomorphic VT in 16 (24%) patients, and ventricular fibrillation in two (3%) patients. Induction was with two premature stimuli in 19 (29%) patients and three premature stimuli in 47 (71%) patients. Of 17 cardiac arrest survivors with sustained ventricular arrhythmia, 16 (94%) patients required three premature stimuli for arrhythmia induction. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced at a right ventricular site in 51 (77%) patients and at a left ventricular site in 15 (23%) patients. Univariate analysis showed a significant (p less than 0.05) association between inducibility of sustained ventricular arrhythmia and VT on Holter in patients with a history of cardiac arrest or syncope but not in patients with presyncope or asymptomatic patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the following were significantly associated with inducibility of sustained ventricular arrhythmia: clinical presentation (cardiac arrest more than syncope more than presyncope more than asymptomatic patients, p = 0.0002; chronic or inducible atrial fibrillation, p = 0.002; and male gender, p = 0.04). In contrast, there was no clinical correlate of induced nonsustained VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we explored the use of continuous wave Doppler-echocardiography guided by color Doppler flow-mapping as a method for noninvasively calculating the rate of pressure rise (RPR) in the left ventricle. Continuous wave Doppler determination of the velocities in mitral regurgitant jets allows calculation of instantaneous pressure gradients between the left ventricle and the left atrium. Left atrial pressure variations in early systole can be considered negligible; therefore, the rising segment of the mitral regurgitation velocity curve should reflect left ventricular pressure increase. We studied 50 patients (mean age, 51 years; range, 25-66 years) in normal sinus rhythm with color Doppler-proven mitral regurgitation and compared the Doppler-derived left ventricular RPR with peak dP/dt obtained at cardiac catheterization. Doppler studies were performed simultaneously with cardiac catheterization in 11 patients and immediately before in the remaining cases. Two points were arbitrarily selected on the steepest rising segment of the continuous wave mitral regurgitation velocity curve (point A, 1 m/sec, point B, 3 m/sec), and the time interval (t) between them was measured. Following the Bernoulli relation, the pressure rise between points A and B is 32 mm Hg (4vB2-4vA2) and the RPR is 32 mm Hg/t. Results showed a linear correlation between the Doppler RPR and peak dP/dt (r = 0.87, SEE = 316 mm Hg/sec). The RPR in the left ventricle can be derived from the continuous wave Doppler mitral regurgitation velocity curve.\r"

  ".U": "90030808\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that the response to the intracoronary injection of radiographic contrast is reflex in origin and results from stimulation of ventricular sensory endings. Cardiac transplantation results in denervation of the ventricles, and thus, may interrupt the afferent limb of this reflex. In contrast, the recipient sinus node and atrial remnant remain innervated, leaving the efferent cardiac limb of this reflex intact. We hypothesized that if contrast-induced reflex bradycardia and hypotension occurred from stimulation of ventricular chemosensitive endings, then this response would be abolished after cardiac transplantation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the changes in recipient (innervated) and donor (denervated) sinus-node rates (SNR) and mean arterial pressure during selective right (RCA) and left coronary artery (LCA) injection during arteriography in cardiac transplant patients and in patients with intact cardiac innervation. An increase in the recipient SNR was observed in cardiac transplant patients during left and right coronary injections (LCA, 6.6 +/- 1.7 beats/min; RCA, 2.4 +/- 1.4 beats/min) compared with a decrease in the control subjects (LCA, -15.3 +/- 2.3 beats/min; RCA, -6.9 +/- 1.9 beats/min; p less than 0.05 vs. control). This occurred despite significant and comparable decreases in mean arterial pressure in cardiac transplant patients (LCA, -12.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg; RCA, -11.4 +/- 2.2 mm Hg) and control subjects (LCA, -18.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg; RCA, -10.7 +/- 1.6 mm Hg). The donor SNR slowed for LCA injection (-5.4 +/- 2.1 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and RCA injection (-3.0 +/- 1.7 beats/min), which, for the LCA, was less than the slowing of control subjects (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Quantification of the electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization involving the T-U wave complex is usually performed with reference to the axis of the T wave and the QT interval duration. A novel quantitative approach to improve the description of ventricular repolarization was applied to the digitized electrocardiograms of 423 normal subjects. Six electrocardiographic repolarization characteristics were identified: duration, rate, area, symmetry, late phenomena, and interlead heterogeneity. A computer algorithm was designed to automatically interpret the electrocardiographic repolarization segment and measure 11 variables that quantified these repolarization characteristics. The application of redundancy-reduction techniques selected a final set of seven variables that were used in the statistical analysis. The QT interval, which was included in the initial group of variables, was replaced by the time interval between S wave offset and T wave maximum. All selected electrocardiographic variables were independent of age (r2 less than 0.11) and body surface area (r2 less than 0.03); all except the early duration variable were heart rate- and QT interval-independent (r2 less than 0.2, r2 less than 0.13, respectively; and most were uncorrelated to each other. A comparison of repolarization characteristics by gender revealed that repolarization duration was significantly more prolonged (p less than 0.0001) in women than in men. This multidimensional quantitative approach conveys a new and more complete description of the repolarization process and provides an electrocardiographic repolarization database in normal subjects as a reference standard for identifying patients with disordered repolarization.\r"

Over the observed range of cotinine values, the average decrease in blood pressure was 10.7 and 7.0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively.

  ".W": "Lp(a) is a plasma lipoprotein particle consisting of a plasminogenlike protein [apo(a)] disulfide bonded to the apo B moiety of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Increased plasma levels of Lp(a), either independently or interactively with LDL levels, have been shown to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recently, a new class of lipid-lowering drugs, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, have been introduced. These drugs act by decreasing liver cholesterol synthesis resulting in up-regulation of LDL receptors, increased clearance of LDL from plasma, and diminution of plasma LDL levels. In this study, we examined the effect of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on Lp(a) levels in three groups of subjects, five volunteers and two groups of five and 14 patients. In all 24 subjects, mean decreases were observed in total cholesterol (43 +/- 5%), total triglyceride (35 +/- 8%), very low-density lipoprotein (45 +/- 9%), and LDL cholesterol (43 +/- 5%). The mean change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was an increase of 7 +/- 8%. Despite the very significant decrease in LDL cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001), Lp(a) levels increased by 33 +/- 12% (p less than 0.005). This was not associated with a measurable change in the chemical composition or size of the Lp(a) particle. This emphatically suggests that Lp(a) particles, despite consisting principally of LDL, are cleared from plasma differently than LDL. The surprising finding of an increase in Lp(a) levels suggests this class of drugs may have a direct effect on Lp(a) synthesis or clearance independent of its effect on LDL receptors.\r"

In 1980, all women completed an independently validated dietary questionnaire. During 4 years of follow-up, 3,275 women reported a diagnosis of hypertension; the validity of the self-report was shown in a subsample. Age, relative weight, and alcohol consumption were the strongest predictors for the development of hypertension. Dietary calcium and magnesium had independent and significant inverse associations with hypertension. For women with a calcium intake of at least 800 mg/day, the relative risk of hypertension was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.88) when compared with an intake of less than 400 mg/day. The relative risk for magnesium intake of 300 mg/day or more compared with an intake of less than 200 mg/day was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.88). For women with high intakes of both calcium and magnesium compared with those having low intakes of both, the relative risk of hypertension was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.80). No independent associations with hypertension were observed for intakes of potassium, fiber, and saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. These prospective findings add to the growing evidence to support the need for randomized trials to determine whether there is a protective role of dietary calcium and magnesium in the regulation of blood pressure.\r"
