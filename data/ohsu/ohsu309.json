The cochleae were examined, by light and electron microscopy, six months after the end of treatment. The organs of Corti of the treated ears were completely destroyed, and in the most advanced lesions, were substituted by a single layer of very thin flat cells. In the spiral ganglion only some glial cells and a few neurons could be observed. All surviving neurons were myelinated, and their ultrastructure was greatly altered, with disorganization of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. The basilar membrane almost disappeared, losing it amorphous and filamentous components. The spiral limbus and the stria vascularis were atrophic and were also covered, in the final stages, by flat elongated cells. In view of its morphological characteristics, this epithelium may arise from the displacement of the interdental cells and perhaps from the cochlear surface of Reissner's membrane.\r"

At the level of the intermediate portion, however, a different cell type--the granular cell--is present, with its luminal surface covered by large amounts of solid material. On the basis of light and transmission electron microscopic studies presented elsewhere, a higher degree of functional specialization in this portion of the gerbilline sac is proposed.\r"

These changes were not related to the ovarian steroid hormones. The change in the PAS stain was due to the low estrogen blood level.\r"

The most popular of these drugs are streptomycin and aureomycin (Botros et al., 1954; Zwiefach, 1955; El-Mofty, 1962), terramycin and chloromycetin (Hoover and King, 1953) and ampicillin, septrin and vibramycin (Ssali, 1975). El-Mofty and Attia (1957) attributed considerable value to the use of 20 per cent aureomycin ointment locally in treating the disease. Nigonol in the form of a local injection was tried by Toppozada et al. (1967) and they claimed good results. Shaer et al. (1981) reported that local application of 2 per cent acriflavine solution over an eight-week period was an effective and safe remedy for rhinoscleroma. Rifampicin has been used systemically with success as a new antibiotic for the treatment of scleroma (Riad, 1982). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of rhinoscleroma to local medication with rifampicin.\r"

In this paper we describe improved techniques for detecting salivary hemagglutinins and report initial results obtained with these methods. The stability of salivary hemagglutinins at several different temperatures was examined in liquid samples and in dried stains on filter paper, cigarette butts, and envelope flaps. Our observations indicate that salivary hemagglutinins may be sufficiently stable, over periods of one to several days at ambient room temperatures, to be of value to forensic science investigators. The results of the hemagglutinin assay are not affected by the age or sex of the sample donor. Because salivary hemagglutinins can be used to determine ABO blood type, analyses of this kind can serve as an important confirmatory test which the forensic serologist can use in conjunction with salivary agglutinogen determinations.\r"

  ".W": "A laboratory system of examination of illicit cocaine exhibits is described. Separation and identification of many of the components in exhibits are achieved by the use of capillary column gas chromatography and a Finnigan ion trap detector. Further examination and quantitation of the components of exhibits is achieved using two high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) systems. Both of these systems use identical reverse phase C8 columns. System 1 employs a solvent composed of 40% acetonitrile, 10% tetrahydrofuran and 50% 0.1% v/v aqueous triethylamine. The eluant is monitored at 280 nm. This system is preferred for routine quantitative analysis of cocaine and related alkaloids in exhibits. System 2 employs a solvent composed of 30% acetonitrile and 70% 0.05M phosphate buffer (pH = 5.0). The eluant from this system is monitored at both 220 and 280 nm. This system offers advantages in sensitivity. The relative retention times of a number of relevant substances as determined with gas chromatography and the two HPLC systems are given. The utility of the methodology for the identification and comparison of exhibits is demonstrated.\r"

Although its relevance to human wounding can be debated, the terminal ballistics of military small arms in ordnance gelatin remains a convenient medium for comparative testing. In the present study, 7- by 10- by 24-in. (18 by 25 by 61 cm) blocks of 20% ordnance gelatin were fired upon from a range of 19 ft (6 m) under high-speed cinemagraphic surveillance. The tendency of the M193 5.56-mm full metal jacket projectile to break up in soft tissue simulant was confirmed as a fundamental difference from the 7.62-mm M80 NATO ball.\r"

Using femur head diameter to sort those specimens which were misclassified by their discriminant function score yielded classification rates of 96 and 98%. These results are compared to a range of 92 to 100% obtained with the index in earlier studies of American black and white pelvic bone samples.\r"

  ".W": "Investigators have implied that palatal rugae are unique to each individual. However, these researchers have disagreed as to whether or not legal identification could be based solely on palatal rugae. Previous studies used poor duplicating materials and may not have considered the effects of growth, extractions, palatal expansion, or some combination of these. The inadvertent use of other features of the cast, such as teeth, edentulous ridge morphology, muscle attachments, vestibular depth, or some combination of these, to aid in the identification, may have influenced their results. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if palatal rugae can be relied upon for identification. Twenty-five orthodontic cases were selected with pre- and post-treatment casts; orthodontic treatment had taken eighteen to sixty months. One hundred casts were randomly selected as variables. All casts were trimmed so that all areas except for the rugae area of the hard palate were removed. The twenty-five post-orthodontic casts were dispersed within 100 randomly selected casts. Nine investigators were given the twenty-five pre-orthodontic casts and asked to compare them to the other one hundred and twenty-five casts for possible matches. Data were collected as to percentage of correct matches and time required for comparison. Each set of pre- and post-orthodontic casts was properly identified (100%) by 8 investigators, and the remaining investigator correctly matched 22 out of 25 casts (88%). These conclusions were drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), two of these antibodies reacted with chloroform/methanol soluble antigens. Folch extraction and partition followed by silicic acid column chromatography revealed the antigens to be glycolipids. Studies with a variety of purified lipids revealed that the antibodies reacted with galactosyl sphingosine, cerebrosides and sulfatides. These antibodies have been used to examine galactosphingolipids in brains with AD with both quantitative ELISA and immunocytochemical techniques. Additionally, the galactolipid composition of Pick's disease has also been studied using these antibodies.\r"

For example, phosphorylated neurofilaments are located within axons but are not normally present in the majority of perikarya of the central nervous system. This pattern can be altered in disease, and neurofilaments that accumulate within perikarya can be phosphorylated inappropriately. To determine whether retained neurofilaments were phosphorylated inappropriately, we used immunocytochemical techniques to examine several diseases in animals in which neurofilaments accumulate within neuronal perikarya. Our investigations of diseases with disparate etiologies show that, whenever neurofilaments are retained within the neuronal perikarya, they are phosphorylated. These results suggest that phosphorylation of neurofilaments in an inappropriate location, i.e. perikarya, may be a nonspecific disease-related response of neurons that can be initiated by a variety of cellular injuries.\r"

  ".W": "The temporal evolution of changes in the distribution of neurofilaments, vimentin-intermediate filaments (IF) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-IF induced by 2,5-hexanedione (2,5HD) has been investigated in dissociated cultures of fetal mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Aggregates of GFAP-IF, labelled by antibodies against GFAP, appeared in astrocytes approximately one week after axonal swellings filled with neurofilaments were detected in neurons by labelling with antibodies to 68 kD or 200 kD neurofilament proteins. The threshold concentration required for aggregation of GFAP-IF was 1.4 to 2 times that required for neurofilament accumulations. In contrast to findings in cultured human skin fibroblasts, aggregates of vimentin-IF were not found in 2,5HD-treated cultures from mouse tissue (non-neuronal cells of spinal cord-DRG or fibroblasts from skin or muscle). The IF of 3T3 cells, a mouse fibroblast cell line, formed diffuse juxtanuclear aggregates only after high levels of exposure to 2,5HD. The sensitivity of vimentin-IF to aggregation by 2,5HD was proportional to the IF content of the cell type. These differences in the sensitivity of IF to aggregation by 2,5HD among cell types and species explain why IF-aggregates have not been observed previously in non-neuronal cells in human patients with the neuropathy associated with 2,5HD, or in experimental studies with rodents.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombosis on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied in rats using horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Endothelial injury with subsequent platelet thrombosis was produced by means of a rose bengal-sensitized photochemical reaction, facilitated by irradiating the right proximal MCA segment with the focused beam of an argon laser. At 15 minutes following thrombosis formation, diffuse leakage of HRP was observed bilaterally within cortical and subcortical brain areas. Peroxidase extravasation was most dense within the territory of the occluded artery including neocortical areas and dorso-lateral striatum. Contralaterally, a similar distribution was observed but with less intense HRP leakage. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated an increase in permeability to HRP within arterioles, venules and capillaries. At these sites, the vascular endothelium contained HRP-filled pinocytotic vesicles and tubular profiles. Although less intense, bilateral HRP leakage was also observed following MCA stenosis or femoral artery occlusion. Endothelial-platelet interactions at the site of vascular injury may be responsible for releasing substances or neurohumoral factors which contribute to the acute opening of the BBB.\r"

Postmortem examinations in two cases showed moderate cerebral and spinal atrophy, ill-defined areas of incomplete myelin loss in white matter and small necrotic foci in the white matter of gyri, around the basal ganglia and near the dentate nuclei. The main microscopic abnormality was a massive accumulation of PAS-positive polyglucosan bodies (PB) of various sizes and shapes in the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, nerve roots and nerves. These PB were found in the processes of nerve cells and astrocytes, but not in their perikarya. Similar PB were present in peripheral nerves and in the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys. In the third case, a nerve biopsy revealed several, unusually large, PB in the axons of myelinated fibers. These clinicopathologic features are consistent with adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) and are distinctive from other conditions in which PB may accumulate. Twelve similar cases have been reported previously. The diagnosis can be made by nerve biopsy. The pathogenesis of APBD is not known, but it may be a polysaccharide storage disease.\r"

In 84 cases a thymoma was found at surgery, while 163 patients had a non-neoplastic thymus. The duration of symptoms before surgery, the age at onset of the disease and the presence of germinal centres in the thymus did not appear to influence the prognosis. Patients with a non-neoplastic thymus showed a better response to thymectomy. Thymoma was associated with more severe disease and with a higher mortality; moreover, more thymoma patients required corticosteroid treatment in order to achieve good therapeutic results. In our opinion, thymectomy is indicated in the treatment of generalized MG, while ocular myasthenia seems not to be improved by the removal of the thymus.\r"

The occurrence of cerebellar signs did not depend on the histological type of tumour or the extent of tumour spread. Most of the clinically affected patients had mild to pronounced cerebellar atrophy, revealed by CT. The correlation between the amount of CT-confirmed atrophy and the severity of clinical symptoms, however, was poor. Since other reasons for cerebellar dysfunction (e.g. chemotherapy, chronic alcoholism, metastases) were excluded, cerebellar signs were attributed to paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration or to a consequence of severe neoplastic illness. The high incidence of cerebellar dysfunction in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma confirms the frequent histopathological finding of cortical cerebellar degeneration in malignant disease.\r"

Nineteen patients showed SEP abnormalities, mainly an increase of height-covariated latency of cortical components and/or of the central conduction time. Such changes occurred independently of the clinical features of lacunar syndromes, being related more to the lesion location than to its size. SEP studies may be a useful adjunct to the clinical diagnosis of lacunar infarct, possibly also when the CT scans are normal.\r"

Circadian variations of other physiological parameters (oral temperature, urine volume and urinary potassium excretion) and of psychomotor performance (grip strength, tapping rate, visual reaction time and performance on a letter cancellation test) were also assessed. Eight male volunteers (aged 20-34 years) were tested twice over a period of 30 h. Test sessions took place every 3 h (1100 hours, 1400 hours etc.). VEPs were elicited by checkerboard pattern reversals. Significant circadian variations in the VEPs were found for the latencies of the P100 and N140 components, which were longest between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. (P100: 103 ms; N140: 138 ms) and shortest at about 5 p.m. (P100: 97 ms; N140: 130 ms). Pronounced circadian variations were also observed in physiological parameters and in psychomotor performance measures. Circadian variation of oral temperature was correlated with the 24-h profiles of most of the other variables. Time courses of VEP latencies and oral temperature were moderately negatively correlated. However, from the data presented it seems premature to conclude that there is a common pacemaker for the circadian variations of the different parameters investigated.\r"

The effects of embolization were investigated on arterial blood pressure, respiration, local cerebral blood flow, locally available O2 (aO2), steady (DC) potentials and EEG. After embolization the blood pressure and the frequency of respiration decreased transiently. On the embolized side the local cerebral blood flow, aO2, the frequency and amplitude of the EEG diminished markedly and the DC potentials shifted to negative. Similar but less marked and short-lasting changes could be seen on the contralateral side. Pathological examination of the brains revealed extensive infarction with haemorrhagic components. The technique is a promising method for inducing stroke experimentally and offers various ways for its thorough investigation.\r"

Differences in health care utilization patterns by age, cohort differences in use of medical subspecialities, and provider reluctance to perform cancer screening within the general medical care encounter have been suggested as reasons for underscreening. Our study conducted in 1985 documents prior health care utilization patterns of 153 cases of Maryland women with invasive cervical cancer compared with a matched control group. Analysis within three age groups showed that cases were significantly less likely to have ever had a Pap test or to receive regular Pap testing, primarily due to differences in medical care utilization patterns. Never having an obstetrician-gynecology visit, a recent (less than 3 years) internist visit, or not having any out-patient visit were significant risk factors. Other risks included older age at first Pap test, reporting not being told to have routine Pap tests, and not using contraceptives. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, recent out-patient visits and lifetime use of an obstetrician-gynecologist remained significant after adjusting for age interactions with recent Pap test history, underscoring the importance of medical care utilization patterns for screening of cancer of the uterine cervix among the elderly.\r"

This study presents a methodology for targeting cancer screening on the basis of population and disease variation among small geographic areas. Techniques for quantifying the impact of targeting on the predictive value of a positive test are demonstrated, using 329 New York City health areas. Age-truncated crude incidence, late-stage incidence and mortality rates for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer are used, using site-specific truncation points relevant to the age groups appropriate for screening. Coefficient alpha was used to determine rate stability with 2, 3, 5 and 7 years of data. The stability of most small area rates was found to reach acceptable levels only with 5 and 7 years of data. Targeting into areas where breast cancer prevalence was high increased the expected predictive value of a positive test by as much as 50% when compared with areas of average prevalence. Geographic targeting will be most useful where between-area variability in prevalence is large and within-area variability is small. The implications of these results are discussed and future studies are suggested.\r"

Immigrants had an elevated risk of sarcoidosis and were more likely to present with asymptomatic sarcoidosis diagnosed on routine screening chest radiographs. Similar patterns were observed for health professionals, a group with markedly greater access to the diagnostic procedures which label them as having sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis exhibits a spectrum of manifestations, ranging from a totally asymptomatic process discernible only by specific diagnostic scrutiny to a clinically obvious presentation with significant morbidity. For disease entities such as this, apparent patterns of occurrence may depend on differential access in the study population to the maneuvers necessary for diagnosis. Diagnostic access bias, in addition to other diagnostic biases, deserves more careful scrutiny in epidemiologic research.\r"

Eventually, 61 of these came for all-night polysomnographic studies, and 15 of these were found to have SAS. On this basis the lower limit of the prevalence of SAS was estimated to be as high as 1.3%. The majority of subjects with the syndrome were in the age group 50-59 years.\r"

Overall, 10 cases of CCAC had been listed in the files of the Connecticut State Tumor Registry prior to the study, and each of the 10 cases were confirmed as valid. In addition, another 10 cases, all previously undetected, were found after the tissue slides of young women listed as having other cancers of the vagina and cervix were reviewed by expert pathologists, suggesting that prior estimates of the incidence rate for CCAC must be misleading unless special efforts are taken to identify undetected cases. The incidence rates of vaginal CCAC (11 cases total) were highest in 1975-1979, and decreased slightly during 1980-1982. In the cervix (nine cases total), the rate increased consistently since 1970. History of in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol was obtained for five of eight vaginal cases and four of eight cervical cases of CCAC. In all nine cases, exposure to diethylstilbestrol was associated with a history of bleeding during the pregnancy or prior miscarriage. We conclude that the finding of stable (or rising) incidence rates for CCAC occurring nearly 30 years after the marked decrease in diethylstilbestrol sales emphasizes the need for continued clinical and epidemiologic studies of the etiology and clinical course of CCAC.\r"

All assumed conditional independence but each used different pre-test and conditional probabilities. Two statistical approaches were employed: (1) Sorting of patients in ascending deciles of probability and comparing expected and observed probabilities in each decile. (2) Calculation of normally distributed reliability statistics which do not depend on probability subsets and the comparison of resulting probability distributions using these statistics. Both statistical approaches revealed that the Bayesian algorithms overestimated disease probability when it was high and underestimated it when low. Though all three algorithms were frequently incorrect, they differed significantly in their accuracies, suggesting that errors in Bayesian analysis are caused by factors other than the assumption of independence. The errors may be due to differences in sensitivity and specificity of tests applied in different institutions.\r"

Nineteen infants required mechanical ventilation because of severe lung disease (group A), and 19 had mild or no lung disease (group B). Six infants in each group had predetermined Doppler and M-mode criteria of a hemodynamically significant left-to-right ductus shunt (hsPDA). In group A the LVO was similar in infants with and without hsPDA, but those with hsPDA had lower mean arterial pressure (p = 0.006) and lower mean systolic-diastolic CBV (p = 0.001) than those without hsPDA. In group B the presence of hsPDA was associated with a higher LVO (p = 0.002), whereas neither mean arterial pressure nor mean systolic-diastolic CBV differed significantly in infants with and without hsPDA. In infants without hsPDA, those in group A had higher LVO (p = 0.012), lower mean arterial pressure (p = 0.003), and lower estimated systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.004) than those in group B. These results indicate that severely ill preterm infants receiving mechanical ventilation are less able than spontaneously breathing infants to defend systemic pressures and cerebral perfusion through an increase of LVO when a large ductus shunt develops. Possible reasons include an elevated baseline LVO, caused by systemic vasodilation, and hence a low preload reserve.\r"

A significant incidence of left focal seizures (9/35) versus right focal seizures (2/35) was noted, suggesting an effect of the carotid ligation on right hemisphere function. Computed tomographic scans (20/35 infants), electroencephalograms (18/35), ultrasound scans (31/35), and neurologic examinations did not reveal an increased incidence of right hemisphere abnormalities.

  ".W": "This study was undertaken after the observation in a premature infant of a hemolytic anemia with Heinz bodies that appeared to result from administration of a multivitamin preparation. In vitro incubation of erythrocytes of premature infants with sodium ascorbate (0.1 mg/ml) for 3 hours significantly raised the number of Heinz body-containing cells from 17.6 +/- 5.7% to 27.2 +/- 8.2% (mean +/- SE). Erythrocytes of term infants and those of adults developed Heinz bodies after exposure to higher sodium ascorbate concentrations (1.0 mg/ml). Erythrocytes of adult and newborn guinea pigs were similarly affected by sodium ascorbate. Daily intraperitoneal injections of 500 mg of sodium ascorbate, given for 7 days to four adult guinea pigs, caused significant Heinz body formation. These studies indicate that the erythrocytes of premature infants are uniquely sensitive to the development of Heinz bodies after exposure to sodium ascorbate. The levels required to produce Heinz bodies in vitro are in the range of those found in vivo after routine administration of vitamin C to premature infants. The significance of these observations in the development of hyperbilirubinemia in premature infants and in the safety of vitamin C remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the change in ion transport function by measuring the basal transepithelial potential difference (PD) across the ciliated epithelium of the nose in 85 term neonates during the first 72 hours of life. Differences in PD associated with the mode of delivery or the presence of respiratory disease and differences in the PD response to the superfusion of amiloride (10(-5) mol/L) were assessed. We also studied term neonates with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) and acute respiratory insufficiency. Basal PDs during the first 24 hours of life were higher in neonates delivered by cesarean section without prior labor (-29.7 +/- 2.5 mV) and in those with TTN (-38.5 +/- 6.0 mV) than in neonates born during normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (-23.0 +/- 2.9 mV) or cesarean section with prior labor (-23.7 +/- 0.7 mV) or in those with respiratory insufficiency (-22.4 +/- 2.3 mV). The percentage inhibition of PD by amiloride superfusion (less than 24 hours) was significantly lower in infants with TTN (30.9 +/- 4.9%) and after cesarean section without prior labor (31.8 +/- 2.2%) than in other groups (37.6 +/- 1.6%). By 48 hours, nasal PDs after cesarean section without prior labor and in neonates with TTN had declined; and by 72 hours, values were similar to those in other groups; respiratory rate paralleled the decline in PD. The respiratory rate of neonates with respiratory insufficiency remained high and paralleled the persistence of respiratory distress. Amiloride sensitivity was similar for all groups by 72 hours. These findings indicate (1) that PDs vary with the mode of delivery and support a role for labor in the normal transition of respiratory epithelial ion transport and (2) that TTN is associated with abnormal epithelial ion transport.\r"

Our observations show that palmar and digital creases develop between 8 and 13 fetal weeks. Digital creases are well defined by 10 weeks; palmar creases are consistently seen by 13 weeks of gestation. The volar pads are present from 8 to 14 fetal weeks. A hand malformation or specific insult that occurs before the time of crease development and that alters the form or function of the fetal hand can cause secondary alterations increase patterns of the hand.\r"

The mean duration of follow-up was 4.5 years with a range of 1.3 to 8.6 years, and the setting was a major metropolitan children's hospital providing primary as well as tertiary care. All patients received antibiotics (most commonly chloramphenicol, 75 to 100 mg/kg/day, in combination with oxacillin, 150 to 200 mg/kg/day) to which the sinus and intracranial organisms are susceptible. Surgical drainage of loculated infection was done for patients with acute neurologic symptoms or signs and for those patients whose abscesses enlarged during medical therapy. Three patients underwent immediate drainage of intracranial abscesses because of acute neurologic signs and symptoms. Sequential CT scans demonstrated enlargement of the intracranial abscesses in the remaining 10 patients. This apparent failure of medical management could not be explained by duration of symptoms before therapy, size of lesion, choice of antibiotics, or use of steroids. No child was successfully treated with antibiotics alone. Successful management consisted of antibiotic therapy combined with surgical drainage of loculated infection. This approach to therapy is preferred for all children with intracranial abscess associated with sinusitis.\r"

In over one third of cases, acute pancreatitis was one feature of a multisystem disease (Reye syndrome, sepsis, shock, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, viral infections). Other common causes included blunt trauma (15%), acquired or congenital structural defects (10%), metabolic diseases (10%), and drug toxicity (3%). In 25% of cases, no cause was identified. All conscious patients complained of abdominal pain, but the location, severity, and duration of pain were extremely variable. Vomiting was a common symptom. Ultrasonography was helpful in establishing the diagnosis and for assessment of complications such as pseudocyst formation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used to identify structural or anatomic lesions in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Serum cationic trypsin(ogen) was superior to amylase in the early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, and was more consistently elevated during the first 5 days in the hospital. Patients were managed conservatively with complete bowel rest, gastric decompression, intravenous fluid therapy, and pain relief. Pancreatic pseudocysts occurred in 10% of patients. There were 13 fatalities, all in patients with a severe multisystem disorder. Recurrences of acute pancreatitis were noted only in certain diagnostic groups: idiopathic pancreatitis, structural anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary tree, metabolic disorders, and (in a single patient) familial pancreatitis.\r"

Characteristic tubuloreticular structures were also demonstrated in the glomerular endothelial or epithelial cells in two cases. Renal disease is part of the multisystem involvement in children with AIDS. The pathogenesis of renal disease is not known, but circulating immune complexes are known to occur in children with HIV infection and may be involved.\r"

Using the scoring system, we evaluated two cohorts of patients: those in whom a diagnosis of trisomy 18 was previously established (retrospective group) and those in whom the diagnosis was suspected but not yet proved (prospective group). The average score in the retrospective series (n = 25) was 96.7, and no patient scored less than 70. Twenty-two patients were evaluated prospectively; in all cases the presence or absence of trisomy 18 was correctly predicted. The average score in the 11 patients without trisomy 18 was 41.4, and all patients scored 60 or less. In the 11 patients confirmed to have trisomy 18, the average score was 94.3, with a range of 70 to 113. This scoring system is an accurate, reproducible method for predicting trisomy 18 in neonates with multiple congenital malformations.\r"

Roentgenologic examination carried out after 1 year of corticosteroid therapy in one patient and after 11 years in another showed considerable improvement of the bony changes.

Overall, the treatment was well tolerated, resulting in no significant side effects other than persistent hyperglycinemia. Normal growth was observed in all patients. Of four patients with the chronic phenotype, three, whose treatment was delayed beyond the first year of life, are mentally retarded. Two of five patients with the acute phenotype are retarded. The outcome in these two was complicated in one by neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage and in the other by therapeutic noncompliance. In our patients, only those who were treated successfully from early infancy and had no complications did not develop mental retardation. After initiation of therapy, there was a significant decrease in ketoacidotic attacks requiring hospitalization. Glycine is indicated for the treatment of acute ketoacidosis in these patients; none of the catastrophically ill newborn who received glycine died. The aim of treatment is to reduce the isovaleric acid burden to a minimum. Therapy consisting of leucine restriction with supplemental glycine and carniline should be started as soon as possible after birth.\r"

  ".W": "Growth, 96-hour balance of nutrients (nitrogen, fat, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and magnesium), metabolizable energy, and serum biochemical markers of mineral status (Ca and P concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity) were measured in 22 very low birth weight infants to investigate the bioavailability of minerals from specialized formula and from human milk fortifiers. The intakes of Ca and P were similar between group FORM (\"Preemie\" SMA) and group CMF (1:1 wt/wt, human milk and Similac Natural Care or Similac Special Care). The intakes of nitrogen, energy, fat, and magnesium differed between groups. Group CMF had significantly greater fecal losses and significantly lower absorption and retention of Ca and P in comparison with those of group FORM. Retention of Ca and P in both groups, however, was greater than 25% below intrauterine estimates of accretion. Retention rates of Ca, P, and magnesium were not correlated with their respective intakes. Weight gain during the balance study and during the entire study interval was significantly less in group CMF. The ratio of Ca retention to either weight gained or nitrogen retained was lower in group CMF, which suggested that the low retention of Ca was related less to the slower rate of growth in these infants than to their greater fecal losses of Ca. Although the cause of the greater fecal losses of Ca and P in this group is unclear, the data suggest an insolubility of the mineral sources. Our results indicate that sole reliance on the absolute mineral concentrations of the milk selected for very low birth weight infants may be unrealistic; the bioavailability of Ca and P from particular mineral sources should be evaluated.\r"

In the unstimulated small intestine, but not in the stomach or colon, i.a. TMB and TMB-M caused activation of circular muscle. Like the activation by i.a. [Met5]-enkephalin, this was antagonized by naloxone. In field-stimulated segments of stomach and small intestine circular muscle, TMB or TMB-M, like dynorphin-1-13 or [Met5]-enkephalin, inhibited the phasic and tonic contractions which were mediated mostly by cholinergic, postganglionic nerves. However, the inhibitory effects of dynorphin-1-13 or [Met5]-enkephalin on small intestine were antagonized by naloxone whereas those of TMB sometimes or those of TMB-M usually were not. TMB or TMB-M did not affect responses to i.a. acetylcholine, but high doses reduced the contractile responses to subsequent field stimulation and excitatory responses to [Met5]-enkephalin. We concluded that the excitatory local actions of TMB or TMB-M on small intestine involved opioid receptors probably of the mu or delta types. Inhibitory local actions on nerve-mediated responses, however, may not have involved opioid receptors. Comparison of these data to results when TMB or TMB-M were given i.v. suggests that these agents also have peripheral actions to affect gastrointestinal motility at sites outside the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

  ".W": "The mode of action of ICI 169,369, a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonist, was investigated in arterial muscle. Isolated preparations from calf coronary artery and from rat tail artery with the endothelium rubbed off were set up to contract isometrically with 5-HT. ICI 169,369 (1-3000 nM) antagonized surmountably and competitively the contractile effects of 5-HT in coronary artery (pKB, 9.1) and tail artery (pKB, 8.8). Methysergide antagonized unsurmountably 5-HT-induced contractions by reducing maximum effects to 25% (coronary artery: pIC50, 9.8) and 60% (tail artery: pIC80, 9.0). ICI 169,369 (100-300 nM) restored the maximum effects of 5-HT that had been depressed by methysergide (20 nM coronary artery, 100 nM tail artery). Preincubation with ICI 169,369 also prevented the methysergide-induced depression of the maximum effects of 5-HT. The protective effect of ICI 169,369 was overcome by high methysergide concentrations (up to 3 microM), suggesting competition between the two drugs for a common site. The data are consistent with an allosterically modulated interconversion of the 5-HT2 receptor between two states (R in equilibrium R'). ICI 169,369 competes with 5-HT for the 5-HT2 receptor. ICI 169,369 and methysergide also compete for an allosteric site of the 5-HT2 receptor system, thereby facilitating the highly active R-state and low active R'-state, respectively.\r"

On aorta, the reduction in the norepinephrine maximum contraction by diltiazem was significantly greater in aged rats (40% reduction) than in young rats (12% reduction). The results obtained by reducing the extracellular calcium were indistinguishable from those with diltiazem (reduction in norepinephrine maximum: aged, 55%; young, 19%). The potency (negative log EC50) of norepinephrine was less in aorta from aged than from young rats. This was not due to a lower affinity (pKA) of norepinephrine for the alpha adrenoceptors, but to a reduced alpha adrenoceptor reserve for norepinephrine. On pulmonary artery none of the above age-related changes was seen. It is concluded that, in aorta from aged rats, the inhibitory effect of diltiazem on norepinephrine-induced contractions is enhanced, and that this is due to the age-related reduction in alpha adrenoceptor reserve in this vessel.\r"

In acute experiments in vivo, this antagonist increased urine volume and decreased urine osmolality after i.v. or s.c. administration in normally hydrated or dehydrated Sprague-Dawley rats. It did not show any effects in water-loaded rats. The duration of action of the antagonist was between 3 to 4 hr. Chronic i.v. infusion or repeated s.c. injections did not result in a persistent diabetes insipidus. A transient rise in water excretion was followed by a progressive normalization. The marked initial water loss was fully compensated for by an increased water intake so that plasma volume and extracellular fluid volume remained unchanged. After 1 week of treatment with the antagonist, glomerular filtration rate and plasma renin activity were not significantly different from base-line values. Only small functional deficits in renal concentrating capacity became manifest when drinking water was withheld. It is possible that the activation of endogenous compensatory mechanisms restored water balance during chronic arginine vasopressin receptor blockade. An intrinsic agonism of this antagonist, which was not detectable in acute experiments, might have contributed to the normalization of water balance by limiting the maximum anti-antidiuretic effects of renal tubular arginine vasopressin receptor blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The arginine vasopressin (AVP) analog d-(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP is a potent competitive antagonist of AVP at renal tubular AVP receptors. In Sprague-Dawley rats, this compound induces diuresis after single injections but only a transient diabetes insipidus-like state during continuous infusion. To further evaluate the pharmacologic profile of d-(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP, the present experiments were performed in Brattleboro rats homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus. In these rats, acute and chronic administration of the antagonist induced significant antidiuretic effects. These agonistic effects persisted for up to 4 days after single injections and for more than 2 weeks after stopping continuous infusions. The antidiuretic effects of the antagonist during chronic administration were indistinguishable from those of AVP replacement. When the renal tubular AVP receptor antagonist was infused into diabetes insipidus rats that had received AVP for 1 week, it induced a transient rise in water intake. However, the peak values after administration of the antagonist were much lower than after AVP withdrawal. These observations suggest that d-(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP has substantial agonistic properties that are not detectable in Sprague-Dawley rats except for limiting the compound's maximum anti-antidiuretic efficacy. These agonistic effects together with endogenous compensatory mechanisms may allow Sprague-Dawley rats to maintain a normal water balance during the continuous administration of d-(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP.\r"

We used a primary culture of rat aortic myocytes to study the effect of protein kinase C on isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. Addition of the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to these cells, but not an inactive analog, increased the stimulation of cyclic AMP production induced with isoproterenol or forskolin without changes in the apparent affinity of these compounds but did not affect the basal cAMP level. TPA also enhanced the cholera toxin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Isoproterenol and cholera toxin increased the forskolin apparent potency suggesting that interaction of activatory GTP-dependent protein with the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase facilitates forskolin interaction to the catalytic subunit. Treatment of myocytes with pertussis toxin had no effect on the basal level of cyclic AMP production and did not significantly modify isoproterenol- and forskolin-induced stimulation. Pertussis toxin treatment of cells did not affect the TPA-enhanced isoproterenol or forskolin stimulations suggesting that pertussis toxin and TPA actions would not share a common target of myocyte adenylate cyclase system. Our data would be in agreement with a possible direct interaction of protein kinase C with the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase system.\r"

After a period of adaptation to caffeine these monkeys were mated with untreated males. Reproductive failure in the form of stillbirths and miscarriages was observed in the treated groups. Subsequently, 12 control monkeys and 1 low-dose monkey were added to the study and most of the original monkeys rebred. The second round of pregnancies confirmed that the treated monkeys had an increased rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. The precise cause of death of the stillborn infants could not be determined. Maternal weight gain and infant birth weights decreased in a dose-related manner. These results indicate that in utero exposure to methylxanthines (caffeine and/or its major metabolite theophylline) adversely affects pregnancy outcome in the monkey.\r"

  ".W": "Cephalosporin antibiotics can produce renal cortical mitochondrial respiratory toxicity after either in vitro or in vivo exposure. In vitro toxicity is immediate, nonselective among toxic and nontoxic cephalosporins and reversed by substrate excess. In vivo toxicity is delayed, specific to the nephrotoxic cephalosporins and not reversible. Both routes of exposure affect respiration with succinate (S) more than with glutamate plus malate as substrates. Because glutamate and malate gain access to the intramitochondrial electron transport chain proximal to S, this pattern suggests that the cephalosporins affect a mitochondrial function outside the respiratory chain. A model of respiratory toxicity incorporating all of these features proposes that all cephalosporins can fit the affected transporters for mitochondrial substrate uptake, but, in the intact kidney, this causes limited or transient respiratory inhibition with nontoxic cephalosporins; in vivo toxicity, which is seen after later isolation and washing of mitochondria exposed in situ, develops with the more sequestered and reactive (nephrotoxic) cephalosporins that acylate these transporters. As a test of this hypothesis, studies were done, using the method of sieve filtration, to evaluate the effects of in vivo and in vitro exposure to cephaloglycin (toxic) and cephalexin (nontoxic) on the uptake of S and ADP by rabbit renal cortical mitochondria. In vivo and in vitro exposure to cephaloglycin reduced the net uptake of S by 70% and had a considerably smaller and less consistent effect on ADP uptake; cephalexin inhibited S uptake only with in vitro exposure. The rate of S washout from cephaloglycin-intoxicated mitochondria was no greater than from controls, ruling out increased efflux as a cause of decreased net uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prazosin had a significantly lower affinity for the soluble receptor, whereas the other adrenergic ligands had the same affinity for both forms of the receptor. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor was affinity-labeled with 2-[4-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodobenzoyl)piperazin-1-yl]-4-amino-6,7- dimethoxyquinazoline and analyzed by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Behavioral augmentation also has been shown with opioids such as morphine, and it is known that a stimulant action on dopaminergic perikarya in the ventromedial mesencephalon is critical to the development of behavioral sensitization to morphine. To determine if amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization might also involve the mesencephalic dopamine neurons, amphetamine was microinjected daily for 2 days into regions of the rat brain containing dopamine cell bodies (A10 and A9 dopamine regions), or dopamine terminals (nucleus accumbens and striatum), and 6 days later amphetamine was given peripherally. It was found that daily amphetamine injection into the A10 or A9 dopamine region, but not into the dopamine terminal fields, significantly potentiated the motor stimulant effect of peripherally administered amphetamine. The behavioral sensitization produced by intracranial injection of amphetamine was found to be dose-dependent. Intra-A10 injection of amphetamine also was found to potentiate the motor stimulant effect of peripheral cocaine. These data indicate that an action by amphetamine in the A10 and A9 dopamine regions may play a critical role in the development of behavioral sensitization.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that antibodies in sera from patients with halothane hepatitis recognize halothane-induced liver microsomal polypeptide neoantigens, and have suggested that these antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hepatitis. In the present study, the mechanism of neoantigen generation was investigated. Liver microsomes from rats treated in vivo with halothane or deuterated halothane were tested by immunoblotting for reactivity with patients' sera and with an antiserum specific for the covalently bound trifluoroacetyl (TFA) halide metabolite of halothane. Rat liver microsomes incubated aerobically or anaerobically with halothane or deuterated halothane in vitro, +/- NADPH and/or NADH, were also analyzed. The results obtained demonstrate that neoantigen expression involves oxidative halothane metabolism by cytochromes P-450 to TFA halide and covalent binding of the TFA group to the proteins. Incubation of microsomes from halothane-treated rats with 1 M piperidine cleaved the TFA groups from the proteins and abolished antigenicity, confirming this conclusion. Recognition of the neoantigens by the patients' antibodies was inhibited only partially using the hapten derivative N-E-TFA-L-lysine. It appears that the patients' antibodies recognize epitopes consisting of the TFA group plus associated structural features of the protein carriers (100 kDa, 76 kDa, 59 kDa, 57 kDa and 54 kDa), not the TFA hapten alone. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first characterization of drug metabolite-tissue protein neoantigens implicated in a drug hypersensitivity. The approach described may be of general utility for characterization of drug-induced neoantigens associated with other drug hypersensitivities.\r"

MxSO4 (5 X 10(-6) M) was found to effectively relax maximal norepinephrine (NE; at 5 X 10(-6) M) contraction, but failed to relax 80 mM K+-induced contraction. MxSO4-induced relaxation was endothelium independent. When the tissues were exposed to increased extracellular K+ (10-25 mM), and then contracted with NE, the relaxation response to MxSO4 was significantly attenuated. Tetraethylammonium (5-10 mM) pretreatment caused pronounced inhibition of MxSO4-induced relaxation. Pretreatment with ouabain (0.5-5 microM) also significantly inhibited MxSO4 relaxation. This effect of ouabain was found to be due to its effect on K+ gradient. These data suggested a role of K+ permeability during MxSO4 relaxation which was further confirmed when it was found that MxSO4 can cause a significant stimulation of 42K efflux from the mesenteric artery preloaded with 42K. It is suggested that MxSO4 may act as a K+ channel agonist to affect the plasmalemmal Ca++ permeability during agonist activation. Consistent with this, MxSO4 was demonstrated to cause an inhibition of NE-stimulated 45Ca influx in this tissue. Such a strong dependence on K+ permeability makes MxSO4 a unique vasodilator among the clinically used vasodilators.\r"

  ".W": "The release of dopamine (DA) from mesocortical and nigrostriatal nerve terminal fields, as well as its modulation by auto- and heteroreceptors was investigated. Rabbit brain slices obtained from medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus caudate (striatum) were prelabeled with [3H]DA in the presence of 0.3 microM desipramine. Neuronal depolarization was elicited by electrical stimulation. Higher stimulation-evoked overflow of [3H]DA (release) was observed from PFC than from striatal slices. At 0.3 Hz (120 pulses) release from the PFC was 60% higher than from the striatum, and at higher frequencies (10 Hz and 120 or 1200 pulses) the fraction of tissue radioactivity released from the PFC was 550% greater than that released from the striatum. These differences were not eliminated by blockade of autoreceptors with haloperidol, or by inhibition of neuronal uptake with nomifensine. These results suggest that the coupling between neuronal depolarization and DA release is more efficient in the PFC than in the striatum. This may allow the PFC terminals to sustain neurotransmission under continuous fast firing. Selective D2 agonists, as well as nonselective DA agonists, inhibited DA release in a concentration-dependent fashion from the PFC and the striatum. Their effects were blocked by l-sulpiride or haloperidol. SKF 38393, a selective D1 agonist, produced a small facilitation of release from both regions; its effects were blocked by SCH 23390 (a selective D1 antagonist). The latter was ineffective on its own. The maximal degree of inhibition of release produced by apomorphine, bromocriptine and LY-171555 was lower in the PFC than in the striatum; these differences were accentuated greatly at high stimulation rates. When the slices were stimulated at frequencies comparable to the \"in vivo\" firing rates for each neuronal group, apomorphine and LY-171555 were much weaker in inhibiting DA release from the PFC (10 Hz) than from the striatum (3 Hz). In the striatum, strong modulation of DA release by endogenous DA was observed; whereas little modulation was seen in the PFC. Nomifensine produced larger increases in the stimulation-evoked overflow of DA from PFC and there was no synergistic interaction between nomifensine and haloperidol in this structure. In the striatum, marked facilitation of DA overflow was observed when nomifensine and haloperidol were given together. Furthermore, haloperidol per se facilitated DA release from both brain regions; however, the degree of facilitation was frequency dependent in the striatum, but not in the PFC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ca++ and K+ currents were studied in guinea pig ventricular cells and Na+ currents were studied in ventricular cells from cultured neonatal rat; these cells are more suitable for Na+ current measurements than are ventricular cells from guinea pig. Under current clamp conditions, ICS 205-930 at 3 x 10(-5) M prolonged the action potential plateau and increased its amplitude of guinea pig cell. The effect was reversible. Increasing the concentration to 3 x 10(-4) M shortened the plateau, reduced its amplitude and depolarized the resting membrane potential. The effects between 10(-7) and 10(-3) M were examined under voltage-clamp conditions. ICS 205-930 produced a concentration-dependent suppression of inwardly rectifying K+ currents with an IC50 of 1.95 x 10(-5) M at a test potential of -40 mV. The effects were time-and voltage-dependent and the IC50 increased to 1.16 x 10(-4) M at -100 mV. The time-dependent outward current and the time-dependent outward tail currents upon repolarization to between -10 and -30 mV also were blocked by the drug in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 of 3.7 x 10(-5) M. Ca++ currents and Na+ currents also were inhibited in the presence of higher concentration of ICS 205-930 (greater than 10(-4) M), although potency was stronger on Na+ currents. The results show that ICS 205-930 exerts mixed class III and class I antiarrhythmic properties in ventricular myocytes.\r"

The potentiation of LSNS and NE by AVP infusion was abolished by the AVP V1 antagonist, d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP, 400 ng, total dose (n = 6). Because there was a significant difference between the RP of LSNS (stimulation of both preganglionic and postganglionic nerves) and NE (direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle), we verified whether this difference might represent disparate actions of AVP on the ganglia and/or sympathetic neuroeffector sites. To evaluate responses to stimulating only the postganglionic sympathetic nerves, we repeated the above study in animals pretreated with a supramaximal dose of the ganglionic blocking agent hexamethonium (25 mg/kg i.v.). After ganglionic blockade the responses to LSNS were reduced to 22% of control. In the presence of ganglionic blockade, AVP potentiated responses to LSNS (RP = 4.09) (n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Specific binding of [3H]SQ 29,548 routinely amounted to 90 to 97% of total binding. The rate of association was 1.6 x 10(7) and 2.5 x 10(7) M-1 x min-1 in WP and PM, respectively. The corresponding rate of dissociation was 0.07 and 0.12 min-1, resulting in dissociation constants of 4.1 and 5.8 nM in WP and PM, respectively. Saturable binding to a single class of receptors indicated a receptor density of 2633 fmol/mg of protein in WP (1394 receptors/platelet; kd, 4.5 nM) and 1466 fmol/mg of protein in PM (kd, 11.3 nM). Specific binding of [3H]SQ 29,548 was inhibited by five antagonists (high/low affinity kd values in nanomolar), SQ 29,548 (WP, 5.2; PM, 7.3), SQ 28,668 (WP, 32; PM, 73), SQ 30,741 (WP, 28; PM, 50), BM 13,177 (WP, 140; PM, 4834) and BM 13,505 (WP, 5/379; PM, 11). Two agonists, U 44069 and U 46619, inhibited the binding in a biphasic manner, indicating binding to two receptor sites (approximately 20/80%) with kd values of 4/72 and 4/170 nM, respectively, in WP and 7/136 and 19/502 nM, respectively in PM. The demonstrated high affinity binding of [3H]SQ 29,548 to human platelet TP-receptors should make this radioligand a suitable and potentially useful tool in future studies of function, structure and regulation of TP-receptors.\r"

The addition of a double bond in the imidazoline to give an imidazole results in a decrease in potency and the introduction of benzylic hydroxyl group also reduces its activity by 4- and 6-fold, respectively. 2-Fluoro and 5-fluoro catecholimidazoline possess full agonist activity; their potencies being even higher than the parent molecule. The 6-fluoro analog is a partial agonist inasmuch as it produces a response that is only 30% of the maximum response produced by other analogs of imidazoline. In the present study, 4-substituted imidazolines retain their agonist activity, although weaker than desoxycatecholimidazoline. The potency of R- and S-isomers of 4-substituted catecholbenzyl imidazoline were similar. Although these isomers exhibit apparent chemical similarity to catecholamines, small differences between the activity of stereoisomers indicate that the mode of interaction of these molecules at alpha adrenoreceptor may differ from that of stereoisomers of epinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of age on the capacity of the right cardiac sympathetic nerve to release norepinephrine (NE) into perfusion effluent (NE overflow) was studied in hearts isolated from male Fischer 344 rats at 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The hearts were perfused through an aortic cannula with Krebs-Ringer solution and the cardiac sympathetic nerve was stimulated electrically with supra-maximal voltage at frequencies of stimulation that produced 20%, 50% or 80% of maximal NE overflow at each age. The content of NE in the perfusion effluent was measured by electro-chemical detection after alumina extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography separation. The NE overflow was significantly lower in hearts of 12- and 24-month-old animals compared to hearts from 6-month-old animals at each frequency of stimulation. In addition the frequency of stimulation necessary to produce 50% or 80% of maximal NE overflow was significantly greater in heart preparations from both 12- and 24-month-old animals compared to preparations from 6-month-old animals. Perfusion with cocaine (10(-6) M) significantly increased the quantity of NE in the effluent after nerve stimulation only in hearts from 12- and 24-month-old animals. Nevertheless, NE overflow remained significantly lower than that observed in hearts of 6-month-old animals. The results suggest that the capacity of the cardiac sympathetic nerve to release NE is diminished in 12- and 24-month-old animals. Furthermore, in these age groups an increase in neuronal uptake appears to reduce further the quantity of NE made available to the heart. These changes seem to occur by middle age and persist to senescence.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to explore factors that influence the systemic exposure to unhydrolyzed aspirin after oral and systemic administration of the drug to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The experiments were performed according to a crossover design, and drug concentration measurements were made on whole blood. Intravenous injection and oral administration of aspirin (200 mg/kg) showed that the drug is eliminated rapidly (total clearance approximately 45 ml/min/kg; half-life approximately 8 min), that only about one-fourth of the dose is absorbed intact, and that the systemic availability of the oral dose is highly variable (coefficient of variation approximately 60%). A 40 mg/kg i.v. dose was cleared almost twice as rapidly as a 200 mg/kg i.v. dose. Injection of salicylic acid to yield concentrations similar to those obtained after injection of the large dose of aspirin (approximately 400 mg/l) reduced the total clearance of a 40 mg/kg i.v. dose of aspirin by about one-third, suggesting product inhibition of ester hydrolysis. The systemic availability of aspirin infused into the portal circulation was about 80% over a wide range of infusion rates, showing that presystemic hydrolysis of the drug occurs mainly in the gut. As in humans, absorption of orally administered aspirin affects the exponential decline of aspirin concentrations in blood, resulting in an apparent half-life substantially longer than the actual biologic half-life of the drug after i.v. injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The drugs varied considerably in their lipophilicity and, within the series oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, desmethyldiazepam and diazepam, brain extraction of unbound moiety was enhanced as the octanol-water (pH = 7.4) partition coefficient increased. However, with flunitrazepam and midazolam, two fluorine-containing benzodiazepines, extraction was more and less extensive, respectively, than predicted from their lipophilicities. Importantly, the uptake findings were consistent with the characteristic onsets of central effects of the drugs established clinically in humans. The effects of reversible protein binding on uptake also were investigated by the addition of albumin (0-8 g.dl-1) to the injectate. This affected markedly the unbound fraction, determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, and also the brain uptake of all drugs. As the unbound fraction was reduced, the unidirectional brain extraction ratio decreased in a curvilinear fashion toward zero. However, attempts to describe the data were unsuccessful using a conventional model based on transcapillary uptake of only unbound drug whose binding kinetics with albumin were assumed to be the same as those indicated by equilibrium dialysis. The observed brain extraction was greater than predicted, and the discrepancy became more apparent as binding and albumin concentration increased. The data for all of the benzodiazepines could be fitted, however, if the equilibrium association constant was assumed to be smaller in vivo than in vitro, so that the effective unbound fraction in the brain capillaries was substantially higher (5- to 25-fold, dependent on the particular drug) than that estimated in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Na+-H+ exchanger activity was assayed by measuring the dimethylamiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake into these vesicles in the presence of an outward-directed H+ gradient ([pH]o greater than [pH]i). All phenothiazines that were tested inhibited the Na+-H+ exchanger and chlorpromazine sulfoxide (CPZ-SO) was the most potent inhibitor among them. CPZ-SO inhibited the dimethylamiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake in a dose-dependent manner and IC50 for this process was 90 microM. Even though CPZ-SO drastically reduced the initial rates of Na+ uptake, the equilibrium uptake of Na+ into the vesicles was not affected, indicating that the integrity of membrane vesicles was not altered by the drug. Furthermore, the inhibition of the exchanger activity by phenothiazines was not due to nonspecific dissipation of the H+ gradient, because CPZ-SO inhibited the dimethylamiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake even in the absence of a H+ gradient. The inhibition of the exchanger by CPZ-SO was freely and completely reversible. Kinetic analyses of the Na+-H+ exchanger carried out in the presence and absence of CPZ-SO revealed that the nature of the inhibition depended on the composition of the buffers used in the assay of the exchanger because the inhibition was of a mixed type in the mannitol medium, whereas it was of a competitive type in the KCl medium.\r"

In contrast to the prevailing notion, our data indicate that thromboxane A2 is not necessarily the sole or essential mediator involved. Several points support this conclusion. First, the quantitative and temporal aspects of thromboxane B2 release and the myotropic response to leukotriene B4 were weakly correlated (r = 0.73). Second, the dose-response curve for thromboxane A2, based on the amount of thromboxane B2 generated by lung strips contracted with leukotriene B4, was inconsistent with dose-response curves for lung strips contracted with a stable thromboxane A2 mimetic, U-46619 or with synthetic thromboxane A2 itself. Third, thromboxane synthetase inhibitors, typified by OKY-1581 and UK-37248, did not inhibit the myotropic activity of leukotriene B4 under conditions in which thromboxane B2 formation was reduced by 80 to 90%. A thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, BM 13.177, did not inhibit the myotropic activity of leukotriene B4 under conditions in which it antagonized the effects of U-46619. Cyclooxygenase metabolites other than thromboxane A2 must contribute to the mechanism of action of leukotriene B4 or leukotriene B4 effects may be mediated directly on certain cells or receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The major route of hexobarbital metabolism in humans involves hydroxylation at the 3'-position followed by oxidation to a 3'-keto metabolite. Studies were performed to characterize the form of cytochrome P-450 responsible for the initial oxidation. In vitro studies indicated that P-450MP purified from human livers, involved in the 4-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin, efficiently catalyzed the 3'-hydroxylation of hexobarbital; moreover, polyclonal antibodies raised to this enzyme extensively inhibited such activity in human liver microsomes. S-Mephenytoin 4- and hexobarbital 3'-hydroxylase activities in microsomes from different livers were significantly correlated, and both activities were essentially absent in fetal liver preparations. Hexobarbital was also found to inhibit S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation and vice versa, with Ki values similar to the Km values for the measured pathways. These data suggested that in vivo metabolism of hexobarbital would be determined by the same genetic factor(s) responsible for polymorphic 4-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin. This prediction was confirmed by the finding that, after oral administration of a single dose of hexobarbital (300 mg), the 24-hr urinary excretion of 3'-hydroxy- and 3'-ketohexobarbital in a \"poor-metabolizer\" was only one third of that in a subject of the \"extensive-metabolizer\" phenotype. Also, the plasma level of metabolites at 6 hr after administration was reduced, and that of unchanged drug was increased in the poor metabolizer. Finally, a markedly enhanced sedative effect was associated with the impaired metabolism. Accordingly, several lines of in vitro evidence indicate that hexobarbital 3'-hydroxylation is catalyzed by P-450MP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SK&F 102698 was a potent D beta H inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.2 microM on crude enzyme and had a Ki value of 40 nM on purified enzyme. SK&F 102698 produced a dose-dependent fall in NE and a dose-dependent increase in DA in the vasculature of SHR after p.o. administration. Elevation of the vascular DA/NE ratio was observed within 0.5 hr after administration. Peak effects were observed at 12 hr and values were still significantly increased at 18 hr. The rise in the DA/NE ratio of the blood vessels correlated with the fall in blood pressure following the first 4 hr after SK&F 102698. SK&F 102698 inhibited SHR heart D beta H and elevated the myocardial DA/NE ratio approximately 2.4-fold. SK&F 102698 also caused a dose-dependent increase in the whole brain DA/NE ratio of SHR. Catecholamine levels were also studied in six discrete brain regions and SK&F 102698 produced the greatest increase in the DA/NE ratio in the cerebellum, brain stem and midbrain regions, whereas the striatum was the region least affected. No overt sedation was observed in the rats. Further study with SK&F 102698 is warranted to better explore the role of DA and D beta H in pathophysiology, and to determine whether this drug or a congener D beta H inhibitor will be a useful therapeutic agent in humans.\r"

The substances that were assayed included botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, C and E and tetanus toxin. Experiments were done in the presence or absence of antagonists that inhibit either the internalization of toxins or intracellular expression of toxicity. Ammonium chloride and methylamine hydrochloride, agents that inhibit toxins that enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, antagonized botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins. The magnitude of antagonism was substantial for all toxins. Calcium, 3,4-diaminopyridine and guanidine, agents that alter the intracellular expression of toxicity, produced a variable result. They were effective antagonists of botulinum neurotoxin type A, but they were less effective or inactive against the other neurotoxins. The ability of 3,4-diaminopyridine and guanidine to antagonize botulinum neurotoxin type A was highly calcium dependent. When ambient levels of the cation were reduced from 1.8 to 1.0 mM, the activity of the drugs was substantially reduced. The ability of these drugs to produce antagonism was also time dependent. When added simultaneously with toxin, they were maximally active; when added at later times, activity was diminished. A host of agents that alter intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, including theophylline, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine and cholera toxin, were evaluated as potential neurotoxin antagonists. Theophylline and isobutylmethylxanthine produced a transient increase in nerve-evoked muscle twitch. None of the drugs that alter tissue levels of cyclic AMP had a universal effect in antagonizing clostridial toxins. The data here have been compared with published data on drugs that antagonize binding of botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, ethanol-induced intoxication was not antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg) or CGS-8216 (20 mg/kg), nor by the inverse agonists FG-7142 (10-30 mg/kg) or beta CCE (10 mg/kg).

However, neither beta CCE (10 mg/kg) or FG-7142 (less than or equal to 30 mg/kg) alone reversed ethanol-induced intoxication. Moreover, beta CCE (10 mg/kg), when administered just before Ro15-4513, completely antagonized the actions of Ro15-4513 in reversing ethanol-induced intoxication.

The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin and the 5HT1B agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU-24969) also produced depressor effects but, in contrast to 5-HT, facilitated the tail-flick reflex, whereas the 5-HT2 agonists 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane, 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-pyrazine (MK-212) and quipazine produced dose-dependent antinociception and had little or no effect on blood pressure. These results suggest that the antinociceptive and depressor effects of i.t. 5-HT are mediated by spinal 5-HT2 and 5-HT1 receptors, respectively. In other experiments, rats chronically treated with i.t. 5-HT developed tolerance to its antinociceptive effects, whereas chronic i.t. morphine or clonidine did not produce cross-tolerance to i.t. 5-HT. These results suggest that serotonergic spinal antinociceptive mechanisms are distinct from the mechanisms by which opioid receptor and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists produce antinociception in the spinal cord.\r"

In the experiments reported here, the time course for the effect of 75-mg morphine pellet implants on spleen and thymus size and cellularity and in vitro proliferative responses of lymphocytes from male C3H/HeN mice is described. T lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A (Con A) was not significantly affected at 6 or 24 hr after morphine pellet implantation but was reduced at 48 and 72 hr. B lymphocyte proliferation in response to lipopolysaccharide was more sensitive to morphinization, as the response was reduced at the 24, 48 and 72 hr intervals after implantation of the morphine pellet. No differences in Con A- or lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation were observed 96 hr after pellet implantation. Interestingly, a slight elevation of Con A-induced proliferation was observed 120 hr after morphine pellet implantation. By contrast with Con A proliferative data, lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation of lymphocytes from morphine-treated mice was not different from placebo-pelleted mice at 120 hr. A marked atrophy of the spleen and thymus accompanied the reduced splenocyte proliferative responses of morphine-treated mice and was greatest at the 48 to 72 hr postimplantation interval. The attenuation of mitogen-induced proliferative responses and atrophy of immune organs was accompanied by hypothermia and a marked tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of morphine in morphine-pelleted mice at all of the time points that were monitored.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two methods were used: direct measurement of accumulated [3H]DA and determination of the rate of formation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) after exposure to DA. The rate of formation of DOPAC in the latter experiments is a direct function of the rate of DA uptake. The rates of [3H]DA uptake and DOPAC formation are both linear with time in the presence of 10 microM substrate. Studies of [3H]DA accumulation into chopped tissue reveal two apparent components with Km values of 160 nM and 3.8 microM, whereas similar experiments with striatal homogenate or synaptosomes yield a single uptake component with a Km equivalent to the lower value found in chopped tissue. Evaluation of DA uptake via the rate of DOPAC formation gave a Km value of 2.3 microM. (High substrate values were used, so a lower value for Km is not apparent in the data.) The high Km-value component was absent in animals with a lesioned striatum induced by prior nigral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine. Several pharmacologic agents (benztropine, amfonelic acid, bupropion, nomifensine and ouabain) were evaluated. All reduced the uptake of DA in chopped tissue, but with reduced potencies compared with the effect of these agents in synaptosomes. The high Km activity in chopped tissue, as well as the apparent reduced potency of uptake inhibitor, appears to arise from the diffusional barrier present inside more intact tissue. This barrier is not present in homogenates or synaptosomes, and, thus, a single uptake process is seen.\r"

The rate of Al uptake was unchanged by 2,4-dinitrophenol (0.1 mM), 4-aminopyridine (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM) and verapamil (0.1 mM). The rate of Al uptake was increased from a medium containing no added calcium, a treatment which decreases resistance to flux in the paracellular pathway. These results suggest that gastrointestinal Al uptake occurs by an energy-independent, sodium-dependent, paracellular pathway-mediated process.\r"

The integrity of the endothelium was checked by acetylcholine-induced vasodilations. Without any precontraction, isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine and procaterol (selective beta-2 agonist) dilated the canine large coronary artery pretreated with phentolamine (10(-5) M). The rank order of agonist potency was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine greater than procaterol. The pA2 values for metoprolol and ICI 118,551 were determined by the antagonisms of the vasodilator responses to isoproterenol and procaterol. The slopes of Schild plots for metoprolol and ICI 118,551 against isoproterenol and the value for ICI 118,551 against procaterol were not significantly different from unity, but the value for metoprolol against procaterol was significantly less than unity. The pA2 value for metoprolol against isoproterenol was 7.48 and those values for ICI 118,551 against isoproterenol and procaterol was 7.19 and 7.25, respectively. These pA2 values are typical for beta-1 adrenoceptors. The beta adrenoceptors of the canine large coronary artery were examined further using an antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol as a ligand for the binding of beta adrenoceptors. The [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to the canine coronary artery smooth muscle membrane was saturable with a KD of 63.7 pM and a total number of radioligand binding sites of 44 fmol/mg of protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Slices of rat cerebral cortex were incubated with [3H]noradrenaline, superfused and field-stimulated with 1 to 16 monophasic rectangular pulses at frequencies of 0.02 to 40 Hz. 1) Substances acting at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors were identified as antagonists, agonists or partial agonists by comparing their effects on 3H-overflow evoked by a single pulse or by two consecutive pulses at 1 Hz. 2) When 1 to 16 pulses were delivered at 0.02, 0.08, 0.3 and 1 Hz to stimulate outflow of tritium, a frequency-dependent suppression of responses to the second and the following pulses was observed. In the presence of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (10(-6) M), comparable amounts of tritium were released by the first stimulus and each of the following stimuli at 0.02 Hz. In contrast, at 0.08, 0.3 and 1 Hz the amount of 3H-overflow evoked by the first pulse was not reached in response to the following pulses. Clonidine (10(-6) M) diminished markedly the response to the first as well as to the following stimuli, irrespective of the frequency of stimulation. 3) Using two consecutive pulses delivered with decreasing pulse intervals, an apparent reduction or complete abolition of autoinhibition was observed at intervals of less than 100 msec, indicated by reduction or loss of the facilitatory effects of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. The present results provide detailed insights in operational characteristics of alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated autoinhibition and the effects of drugs on this regulatory mechism.\r"

Angiotensin converting enzyme was measured by a radio inhibitor binding method using 125I351A. Rats were gavage fed perindopril (1, 4 and 8 mg/kg) and changes followed over 48 hr. Plasma and kidney ACE were both affected acutely with reduction of 125I351A binding to less than 5% of that in control animals 1 and 2 hr after gavage. Ligand binding to ACE in plasma and kidney returned to control levels after 24 hr. Ligand binding to ACE in lung, aorta and brain also was displaced after perindopril treatment. Changes were of a lesser degree than in plasma or kidney. Maximal effect was 1 to 4 hr after treatment and persisted through 24 hr postgavage. Ligand binding to ACE from testis was little altered over the time period of study. In a dose varying study rats were gavage fed perindopril (0-32 mg/kg) and tissues were studied 4 hr later. Ligand binding to plasma and kidney ACE was displaced by 50% at a dose of 1 mg/kg or less, whereas a dose of 16 to 32 mg/kg was required for a similar effect on ACE in lung, aorta and brain. ACE in testis was only affected to a small degree at a dose of 32 mg/kg. ACE is tissues was inhibited differentially after oral treatment with perindopril. Although differing in bioavailability, bioactivation of the drug or different binding properties of the enzyme could all account for the results, the most likely explanation is that there is variation in tissue penetration of the drug.\r"

A previously developed in vitro method using human lymphocytes and a murine microsomal drug metabolizing system has been used to examine toxicity due to acetaminophen (APAP), sulfonamide antibiotics and aromatic anticonvulsants. An improved method is described in which toxic APAP metabolites are generated by a purified and reconstituted cytochrome P-450 system, minimizing the amount of exogenous detoxification enzymes in the assay. Toxicity is assessed by an objective, automated method based on the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide to an insoluble purple formazan by the mitochondria of viable cells and correlates with that based on trypan blue exclusion. Toxicity required cytochrome P-450 and NADPH, and was inhibited by SKF 525A. Exogenous glutathione also decreased toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Lymphocytes from a glutathione synthetase-deficient patient exhibited markedly enhanced toxicity to APAP exceeding the 95% CL of 10 control subjects over a concentration range of 10 to 1000 micrograms/ml. The data are consistent with the generation of cytochrome P-450-dependent reactive metabolites which subsequently can be detoxified by glutathione. This method allows one to address specifically individual differences in detoxification pathways. The use of an automated assessment of cell viability may prove useful in preclinical screening of new compounds for their propensity to cause \"idiosyncratic\" drug reactions in a predisposed population.\r"

We propose a means of standardizing the pattern of administration for any particular animal, based on a pharmacokinetic study of the antidepressant [here clomipramine (CMI)] in that animal. The plasma half-life (127 min) in the Swiss CD1 mouse was used as a basis for chronic administration, which was strictly every half-life as in clinical use. Daily administration is thus merely repeated acute administration. The antinociceptive action of CMI was compared under four sets of conditions of injection: single, chronic, daily and closely repeated (every 40 min). The antinociceptive effect obtained after an acute injection of CMI (10 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) was increased 2-fold after five chronic injections. Closely repeated injections gave a more marked effect than chronic administration, and daily administration was ineffective. The time course of the antinociceptive action correlated with that of blood and brain levels of CMI and its monodemethylated derivative. The enhancement of the antinociceptive action observed after chronic and closely repeated administration was shown not to be due to any modification of motor activity. It was suppressed by naloxone. Comparison with results reported in the literature shows the benefit of using a well-defined pattern of administration.\r"

No significant difference in the fractional hepatic extraction of D3 was observed when the vitamin was administered via the portal venous route compared to when it was administered via the hepatic arterial route. Estimation of the uptake and clearance of D3 in relation to its route of delivery revealed, however, that due to the higher perfusion flow through the portal venous than through the arterial route, both the hepatic uptake and clearance of D3 were significantly higher after portal vein than after hepatic artery delivery. Moreover, calculation of the uptake of D3 after delivery through the portal venous route also revealed that it was not significantly different from that of the total hepatic uptake (uptake following portal vein + hepatic artery delivery). The data obtained during the present studies indicate, then, that the fractional hepatic extraction of D3 is not dependent on its route of entry into the liver; it also points out that, in experimental models such as in isolated-perfused liver preparations, the portal vein administration of D3 should represent adequately the total hepatic handling of the secosteroid by the normal rat liver.\r"

Either acute or chronic trihexyphenidyl administration did not alter substance P content when administered alone and did not prevent the haloperidol-induced substance P decrease in the striatum and substantia nigra when coadministered with haloperidol. Chronic dietary carbamazepine administration dose-dependently increased substance P content in the striatum and substantia nigra, but not in the raphe area, in a haloperidol-reversible manner. Carbamazepine also dose-dependently increased gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the substantia nigra without altering the striatal dopamine turnover rate. The lack of effect of trihexyphenidyl, an anticholinergic drug used to treat antipsychotic drug-induced extrapyramidal (Parkinson) syndromes, suggests that antipsychotic drug-induced reduction in substance P content is not involved in the extrapyramidal side effects. Since the effects of carbamazepine on substance P content are identical with previously described effects of lithium, an alteration in substance P neurotransmission may be one of the neurochemical bases of common clinical and behavioral effects of carbamazepine and lithium on affective disorders.\r"

In 20 cats, after 9 to 13 weeks of surgery, functional reinnervation of SCG by the vagus was established by contraction of the nictitating membrane in response to stimulation of the vagal preganglionic trunk. This contraction was reduced by the treatment with hexamethonium and atropine. Stimulation of the vagal preganglionic trunk caused release of acetylcholine into perfusate through the anastomosed SCG perfused with Kreb's solution. It is concluded that the vagal afferent fibers do reinnervate the preganglionically denervated SCG and the pharmacological nature of this reinnervated SCG is, at least in part, cholinergic.\r"

The analgesic effects of i.c.v. administered DPDYN were determined in two nociceptive tests, involving thermal cutaneous (tail-flick) and chemical visceral (AcOH-induced writhing) stimuli, in which mu and kappa receptors are known to be activated differentially. The antinociceptive action of DPDYN was compared with that of 1) morphine and U-50,488H, which are, respectively, the prototypical mu and kappa agonists, 2) dynorphin A which is the endogenous parent peptide and 3) Leu-enkephalin, which represents the N-terminal sequence of DPDYN. DPDYN did not show any activity against thermal stimulus but, in contrast, produced a dose-related effect against chemical pain. In the AcOH-writhing test, there was no significant cross-tolerance between morphine and DPDYN in mice made tolerant to morphine. Pretreatment with low doses of s.c. naloxone (less than 1 mg/kg) antagonized completely the antinociceptive action of morphine but only partially reversed the analgesic action of DPDYN. In gastrointestinal studies, DPDYN as well as U-50,488H were ineffective (maximum effect lower than 25%) in inhibiting intestinal transit in mice, in contrast to morphine which produced a dose-related antitransit effect reaching 100%. These data indicate that the in vivo properties, and particularly analgesia, of i.c.v. administered DPDYN are mediated by a \"non-mu\" (presumably kappa) opioid receptor at the supraspinal level of the opioid system of the mouse.\r"

Our results showed significantly increased cadmium concentrations in maternal blood and cord blood in pregnant women who smoked (P less than .05) and significantly increased amniotic fluid cadmium concentrations in women who smoked heavily during pregnancy.

  ".W": "An investigation was undertaken to determine if the incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears has changed and, if so, what the predisposing factors might be. Data were analyzed for a 50-year period (1935-1985). An increased frequency of such tears was found after 1965, when mediolateral episiotomies were replaced almost entirely by midline ones. A constant combined rate of 17% for third- and fourth-degree tears was found for the last decade. When compared with a similar group without such tears, women with extensive tears were more likely to be nulliparous and teenage and to require epidural anesthesia, oxytocin and/or forceps application. When the incidence of tears was compared with that at a nearby community hospital, it was found to be higher at our university medical center. Excluding physician inexperience, the reason was the greater frequency of teenage pregnancies and more common use of epidural anesthesia and oxytocin at our hospital. Rectovaginal fistulae and anal incontinence requiring repair occurred in less than 1% of the total cases. Since midline episiotomies are now being performed often, third- and fourth-degree perineal tears will continue to be common and will depend on the patient population, physician experience and intrapartum hospital policies.\r"

Biopsy methods may produce enough pain, however, to lower patient acceptance. The Endometrial Pipelle is a new plastic endometrial suction curette that provides a histologic biopsy. This study compared the performance of the Pipelle to that of the Vabra aspirator, a widely accepted biopsy device. Endometrial sampling using both techniques was performed on 56 patients. Both instruments provided the correct diagnosis in 50 patients (89%). The Pipelle obtained more tissue than the Vabra in 28 patients (50%) and was noted by the clinician to cause less pain in 50 patients (89%). Forty-seven patients (84%) stated that biopsy with the Pipelle was less painful than with the Vabra. These results suggest that the Pipelle is as efficacious as the Vabra aspirator and has greater patient acceptability.\r"

However, most medical centers do not have CVS capability, nor are all patients candidates for CVS. We investigated the feasibility of performing very early genetic amniocentesis (9-13 weeks' gestational age). The results from those amniocenteses were compared to our own CVS data. In experienced hands, (1) CVS can be performed safely at 8-13 weeks, with the most technical ease at 9-11 weeks; (2) CVS or amniocentesis can be performed on many patients at 12-13 weeks or perhaps even earlier, although no accurate loss rates are available yet; (3) when technically feasible, CVS may be advantageous because of the much faster time period for cytogenetic results from direct preparation or short-term culture; and (4) in those patients on whom CVS cannot be performed, early amniocentesis in selected patients may offer the benefits of early diagnosis.\r"

The traditional program graduate preferred to deal with cases in which important decisions had to be made rapidly and the effects of treatment could be immediately addressed. The two groups disagreed as to who should have major control of health care, on issues of peer review in the office, and on the emphasis physicians should give preventive care.\r"

Using this information, the authors designed a model to project the economic feasibility of establishing a physician practice in a specific community. This model can be used to project the number of physician visits a community can generate, the costs to establish and maintain a clinic, and the gross and net income of the practice.\r"

All participating high school seniors completed a 15-item knowledge test about AIDS prior to the intervention and an equivalent posttest one week after the program was completed. T-test analysis revealed a significant increase in knowledge by students at all five high schools. Responses to 10 subjective posttest questions indicated that the high school students were interested in learning about AIDS and having medical students as their teachers. This program provides an example of how medical institutions can develop a collaborative community education project that contributes to the education of medical students.\r"

Seventy percent of the respondents considered \"after completion of residency\" to be the best time to become pregnant. Sixty percent of the respondents' maternity leaves were six weeks or less in duration. Seventeen percent required some medical leave before delivery, although only 5 percent required more than eight weeks of medical leave. Only a third reported that their training or work sites had maternity leave policies. Ninety-one percent of the respondents reported satisfaction in their careers.\r"

Sessions are scheduled regularly throughout the year and take place outside the hospital; interns are excused from their service responsibilities for the duration of the meeting. Participants focus equally on issues of professional concern (for example, relationships with staff members, peers, and attending physicians or bureaucratic problems such as lack of ancillary help) and personal concern (for example, making necessary life-style adjustments and handling family crises). A variety of techniques are used in the program, but small-group discussions and individual tasks are particularly emphasized. Participants have generally reported satisfaction with the program and positive effects upon their behavior at work and at home.\r"

Protein-bound thiol groups varied in concentration during the cell cycle, but the cyclic pattern did not relate to changes in nonprotein thiol to disulfide groups or to cellular sensitivity to CHIP toxicity. Cultured CHO cells were depleted of intracellular glutathione (GSH) with the use of buthionine sulfoximine. These cells were significantly more sensitive to CHIP toxicity than were control cultures. In addition, although control synchronous CHO cells showed considerable differential cell-cycle phase sensitivity to treatment with CHIP, the sensitivity of GSH-depleted synchronous cells did not alter during the cell cycle.\r"

PDT is based on the interaction of hematoporphyrin derivative and red light of the appropriate wavelength (630 nm) and intensity. Two tumor models were utilized: C3H/Km mice bearing the RIF-1 tumor and BALB/c mice bearing the EMT-6 tumor. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with either cisplatin (DDP), doxorubicin (ADM), PDT, or a combination of drug and PDT. It was demonstrated that the RIF-1 tumor was sensitive to DDP and insensitive to both PDT and ADM. There was no additional antitumor effect when either drug was combined with PDT. The EMT-6 tumor was moderately sensitive to PDT and mildly sensitive to both DDP and ADM. Although the addition of DDP did not potentiate tumor destruction, the addition of ADM significantly enhanced the effect of PDT (P = .01). The enhanced activity of the combination of PDT and ADM appeared to be the result of increased activity of ADM alone, when illuminated with red (630 nm) light. This potentiation may be due to a photochemical process or may be secondary to the mild hyperthermia generated by illumination with the laser. This study demonstrates that PDT combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy is well tolerated in these animals and that certain combinations of PDT and chemotherapy may result in an enhanced tumoricidal effect.\r"

Tumor energy metabolism was studied in C3Hf/Sed mice with isotransplants of a spontaneous murine fibrosarcoma (FSaII, congruent to 100 mm3 in volume) and 31P-NMR. Cardiovascular parameters were measured in anesthetized C3Hf/Sed mice via intracarotid catheter. Hydralazine doses of 0.25 mg/kg given ip caused an increase of the phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio (PCr: Pi) in 5 of 6 animals. These doses had minimal effects on mean arterial blood pressure, though there may have been an increased cardiac output due to a decreased afterload. Hydralazine doses greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/kg given ip were associated with a decrease in PCr, nucleotide triphosphate, and pH, and an increase in Pi (P less than .01 for control vs. 10 mg hydralazine/kg). This substantial decrease in high-energy phosphates was associated with a pronounced decrement in mean arterial blood pressure. These findings provide a rational basis for the study in experimental systems of hydralazine-induced enhancement of cell killing by hyperthermia and by agents toxic to hypoxic cells. Further, these results can be taken as a sign that hydralazine should be used with care in patients undergoing radiation treatment.\r"

These receptors are the same for the proenzyme and the enzyme, but they have a much higher affinity for plasmin (Kd = 6 X 10(-8) M) than for plasminogen (Kd = 5 X 10(-6) M). Plasminogen binding was strongly increased by preincubation of the tumor cells with urokinase and was inhibited by anti-urokinase serum. Because free plasmin is rapidly neutralized in vivo, it is likely that, under physiological conditions, plasminogen is bound by tumor cells and partially transformed into plasmin by urokinase already present at the surface of these cells. Bound plasmin retains its enzymatic activity, which demonstrates that its binding does not involve the enzyme's active site.\r"

Caloric restriction strongly inhibits the development of neoplasia in rodents, and there is evidence of a positive relationship between cancer and body weight in humans. Caloric restriction early in life is also known to permanently diminish organ cellularity. A recent link between adult stature and cancer incidence similarly implicates a lasting effect for growth and possibly for early nutrition in carcinogenesis. It is postulated that cancer risk is proportional to the number of proliferating cells, which in turn depends on both the number of cells and the rate of cell division within the tissue. This hypothesis is consistent with several aspects of human carcinogenesis, including multistage models and the epithelial origin of most cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate and relatively simple monitoring is essential in managing patients with multiple injuries, and becomes particularly important when there is substantial occult blood loss. Tachycardia, said to occur following a 15% blood loss, is generally regarded as the first reliable sign of hemorrhage. However, heart rate is a nonspecific parameter which is affected by factors other than changing intravascular volume. The purpose of this study was to evaluate available means of monitoring volume status and to identify the parameter which is the earliest and most reliable indication of blood loss. Sixteen mongrel dogs were anesthetized and bled by increments of 3% of their total blood volume until the onset of sustained hypotension or a 25% blood loss. All dogs were monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter and an arterial line. Vital signs, full hemodynamic parameters, and arterial and mixed venous blood gases were measured after each 3% blood loss. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that only Cardiac Index and Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation showed linearity as function of measure blood loss. Linear regression analysis generated r values that ranged from 0.85-0.99 with a mean of 0.95 for Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation; r values for Cardiac Index ranged from 0.39-0.98 with a mean of 0.85. Furthermore, all dogs had increased tissue oxygen extraction after 3-6% blood loss. Because Central Venous Blood Oxygen Saturation mirrors Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation and is easily and rapidly measured, we extended our study by repeating all of the previously measured parameters, with the addition of CVP blood gases in an unanesthetized animal model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Southern counties also had high rates of housefire mortality. Drowning rates for young children were high on the West Coast and in Florida, and were high for the population as a whole in the Mississippi Delta. Mapping by county is a potentially powerful tool for identifying high-risk areas and developing preventive measures.\r"

In the present study we used topical NMR to monitor intracellular levels of ATP, creatine phosphate (CrP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and pH in the biceps femoris muscle of rats during hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. Twelve rats weighing 300-500 gm were anesthetized and bled to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50-55 mm Hg for 90 minutes. Then they were resuscitated with lactated Ringers' until MAP returned to normal or resuscitation fluid equaled four times the shed blood volume. During resuscitation, the rats fell into one of two groups: survivor group (n = 5) which could be successfully resuscitated for 60 minutes or longer; or nonsurvivor group (n = 7) which died during resuscitation. In both groups, ATP levels were maintained during hemorrhage and resuscitation. Intramuscular pH dropped about 0.2 pH units in both groups at the end of hemorrhage; however, pH was restored back toward baseline in the survivor group. CrP levels were lower in the nonsurvivor group at the end of hemorrhage. After resuscitation, CrP returned to nearly baseline levels in the survivor group; in the nonsurvivor group, CrP was further depleted after resuscitation. Pi levels were increased in both groups at the end of hemorrhage, but in the survivor group Pi decreased during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation; in the nonsurvivor group Pi increased further to four times baseline levels. This study demonstrated that topical NMR can quantitate a metabolic deficit in skeletal muscle during hemorrhage and resuscitation. The results show that improvement of intracellular Pi and CrP levels correlated with survival.\r"

Intravenous doses of a 50% ethanol/isotonic saline solution were given at equally spaced intervals over 40 minutes to generate peak blood alcohol levels and rates of rise equivalent to the oral study. Impacts with a velocity of 10 m/s and a contact compression of 5 cm were delivered to 85-90% of the right pericardial surface. The 25% mortality from alcohol and trauma was comparable to that observed in the oral study. These results attest to the importance of the rate of alcohol administration over the route on the outcome of cardiac injury.\r"

The donor livers were investigated after completed hemorrhage using an in vitro perfusion system with L-lactate as substrate, together with U-C14-lactate. The residual glycogen stores were determined after perfusions. The incorporation of labelled lactate to glucose was increased in the 120H group by 66.7% and 116.8% compared to the 60H group and controls (p less than 0.01), but glycogenolysis was still the main source of glucose released in the 120H group. Glycogen formation from labelled lactate was 46.6% higher in the 120H group compared to controls (p less than 0.05) and lactate oxidation was decreased by 67.5% (p less than 0.05). The data suggest that hepatocytes are capable of rapid change from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis during hemorrhagic hypovolemia. However, energy-sparing glycogen breakdown is given priority over gluconeogenesis as long as glycogen remains available.\r"

In this study, persons injured in falls demonstrated a statistically significant greater risk of cervical spine injury compared to those injured in motor vehicle accidents (p = 0.001). In alert trauma victims, a statistical correlation with cervical spine injury was noted for individuals who had complaints of neck discomfort (p = 0.028) and for patients who manifested tenderness to neck palpation (p = 0.000039). No cervical spine injury was noted in any alert, not intoxicated, neurologically intact patient who had no complaints of neck discomfort upon questioning or palpation.

Spinal injury was clinically suspected in seven patients because of quadriplegia or paraplegia. However, in the two patients who were neurologically intact a spinal injury was not clinically suspected. In the initial triage of a patient with blunt chest trauma, the supine chest radiograph can play a key role in the identification of a potentially unstable spinal injury and the prevention of subsequent spinal cord injury.\r"

Nineteen patients were identified, with a mean ISS of 44 (range, 20-66). Mean transport time and distance were 2.4 hours and 456 miles, respectively. The estimated average ground transport time for the same patients was 23.8 hours. No deaths occurred during transport, and the overall survival rate was 58%. Transport charges averaged $4,162, which was 14% of the complete hospitalization cost. We conclude that: 1) patient survival after air transport was no different than that predicted for trauma victims with immediate access to a trauma center; 2) postoperative hemodynamic instability predicted a poor outcome; 3) the higher cost of air relative to ground transport is outweighed by significant time savings in these critically injured patients; and 4) air transport following operative stabilization represents an extension of regionalized trauma care to the isolated areas of Washington and Alaska.\r"

Provisions to deal with the following potential problems included: 1) the extreme heat; 2) security; 3) massive crowds on the convention floor; 4) the area in which the demonstrators were staying as well as the area in which the demonstrations were to occur; 5) special requirements for visiting dignitaries; and 6) terrorism. Eighty patients were seen in the protest area. Thirty-nine patients were treated by the Red Cross, and 518 patients were seen in the convention center. Ten patients required transportation to the hospital. Organization, coordination, and cooperation of all personnel and appropriate agencies helped ensure a smooth operation.\r"

The average age of the 13 men and one woman was 30 years; followup averaged 17 months. Most of the patients had associated injuries (Injury Severity Score average, 19). Nine patients had concomitant disruption of the sacroiliac joint requiring either delayed open reduction and internal fixation or prolonged skeletal traction; among the five remaining patients, time to mobilization (bed to chair) averaged 1 day. There were no complications attributable to the procedure; i.e., no infections, and no failures of fixation. In this small series of patients early two-hole plate fixation of the traumatic diastasis of the pubis satisfactorily restored the disrupted anterior pelvic ring, contributed to early mobilization of the patients, and made reduction of a concomitantly disrupted sacroiliac joint easier, whether accomplished by skeletal traction or open reduction and internal fixation during a second procedure.\r"

Debrided tissue was cultured to determine quantitative bacterial counts. The patients' subsequent records were evaluated and the infection rate correlated with culture data and other factors that might be associated with development of infection. Of the 70 patients evaluated, 13 (19%) became infected. When the infection rate was correlated with the use of fixation devices, it was found that 1/19 (5%) of the patients with no implants, 3/16 (19%) of the patients with external fixation devices, and 9/35 (26%) of the patients with internal fixation became infected. Most of the infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria. There was little correlation between the bacterial counts in the first piece of tissue taken at debridement and the development of infection. There was significant correlation between the bacterial count in the last piece of tissue taken at debridement and the development of infection. Thus the infection was correlated with what was in the tissue when the patient left the operating room and not with what was in the tissue when the patient entered the operating room.\r"

Delayed celiotomy was defined as surgical intervention for splenic injury after a trail of nonoperative management lasting at least 24 hours. Delayed celiotomy was not required in any of the 16 cases in the pediatric age group (age less than or equal to 17 years) who were initially managed nonoperatively. In contrast, of the 27 adults who were initially treated nonoperatively, ten (37%) ultimately required celiotomy. Although splenorrhaphy was successfully performed in 21 of 44 patients undergoing early operation, all ten of the patients requiring celiotomy after an unsuccessful trial of observation underwent splenectomy rather than a spleen-preserving procedure. Of the 27 adults who were initially managed nonoperatively, 24 had abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed during their initial diagnostic evaluation. Twenty-three of these scans were reviewed by one of the authors. A CT scoring system was developed, based on the degree of splenic parenchymal and capsular injury and the amount of fluid in the abdomen and the pelvis. Adult patients who were successfully treated without operation had a significantly (p = 0.011) lower total CT score than did patients who required delayed celiotomy. No adult with a total CT score less than 2.5 required delayed operative intervention. These data support\r"

This study reviews and contrasts the experience at Tulane University affiliated hospitals (TU) and the American University of Beirut (AUB) (1980 to 1984), both of which are surrounded by hostile action. Seventy-six male patients (28--AUB, 48--TU) with an average age of 21.2 (TU) and 24.4 (AUB) years (range, 17 to 42) presented with popliteal artery injuries with (34 [14--AUB; 20--TU] ) and without (42 [14--AUB; 28--TU]) associated fractures. All patients were clinically evaluated, angiogrammed, begun on cephalosporin antibiotics, and operated upon. Fractures were treated with extraskeletal fixation or splinting. Time of initiation of operative therapy varied from less than one to greater than 12 hours. When necessary, contralateral limb reversed saphenous vein was used as an interposition graft. Fasciotomies were done for popliteal artery injuries with greater than 6 hours' ischemic time, and combined popliteal artery and popliteal vein injuries. Nine limbs of 76 at risk were amputated: 5/34 (2/14--AUB; 3/20--TU) with popliteal injuries and fractures, and 4/42 (1/14--AUB; 3/28--TU) with popliteal injuries and without fractures. Five of the amputated limbs had initiation of therapy at greater than 12 hours; three had initiation of therapy at greater than 8 hours. Good communication between surgeons, prompt fracture reduction, antibiotics, angiography, and total repair of the vascular injury resulted in limb salvage in 30/40 patients with popliteal artery injury and fracture, and in 39/42 patients with popliteal artery injury without fracture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since then, carotid angiography has documented the location of the bleeding in 12 of the 13 cases (92.3%) in which it was employed. Each of the four cases in which extravasation was visualized from the external carotid artery was successfully treated by transcatheter embolization. We conclude that selective, angiographically guided embolization can reliably achieve hemostasis in a high proportion of patients with maxillofacial injury who are in danger of exsanguination from the branches of the external carotid artery.\r"

The remaining 74 patients (31%) required only observation for a period of 24-48 hours. Fifteen patients (6.3%) died, the mortality being related to head injury in four, irreversible hypovolemic shock in four, pulmonary embolism in three, septicemia in two, and respiratory failure in two. Nonfatal complications included residual hemothorax in 18 cases, persistent air leak in 13, pulmonary infection in eight, pulmonary embolism in one, and empyema in one. The average hospital stay was 6.9 days. Evidence of chest injury of various magnitudes was found in 756 of 2,286 autopsies conducted for trauma-deaths during the same study period analyzed retrospectively; however, it was the major cause of death in only 147 (19%). Cardiac injuries accounted for 41% of the deaths resulting primarily from chest trauma. Only 10% of the patients who sustained cardiac injury reached hospital alive.\r"

The animals were injected with 51Chromium sheep red blood cells (SRBC) at 72 hours. SRBC half life (T1/2) was measured as an index of RES function and the percentage distribution of SRBC in liver, lung, and spleen was calculated. T1/2 was significantly prolonged in PH 50% rats and was associated with decreased radioactive uptake by the liver. Mortality was nil in the control groups and markedly increased in the presence of sepsis. The results suggest that decreased RES function following hepatectomy is dependent upon the proportion of liver removed and that sepsis further increased the mortality of hepatectomized animals.\r"

When hollow viscera or infected organs are uninvolved, autotransfusion is also well accepted in trauma surgery. Less clear is whether shed blood from an injury violating hollow organs in the abdomen can be used safely in the trauma patient. We retrospectively identified 11 patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma who had received enteric contaminated shed blood, processed by the Haemonetics Cell Saver, and reviewed their records for infectious morbidity or mortality. All patients received parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics. Three patients developed infectious wound complications, one probably nosocomial from the intensive care unit. No patient developed intra-abdominal sepsis and no deaths were reported. Based on the results of this preliminary result, it may be appropriate to use autotransfusion of shed blood in trauma patients with gastrointestinal injuries, if banked blood is not readily available and the patients receive perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics.\r"

The results were compared to those of a normal control group. Peripheral conduction velocities were decreased in lead exposed workers and in alcoholics, but not modified in the mercury exposed patients. In the three exposed groups, an amplitude increase (PREPs and upper limb SEP cortical components), more important in the mercury group and an increase of central conduction time in case of lower limb stimulation, could be interpreted as early signs of nervous cortical impairment.\r"

This data suggests that from a clinical point of view the distribution of paraquat into the lungs is not a slow process. There may also exist some efflux of the paraquat into the circulation. This efflux of paraquat may result from direct lung and/or heart injury induced by massive paraquat poisoning.\r"

Ten cases admitted to the observation unit were assigned to the single dose MgCC group. Fourteen cases admitted to either the ICU or the observation unit were assigned to the multiple dose MgCC group. Single dose cases received 30 gm of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) at 0 hours. Multiple dose cases received 3 30 gm doses of MgSO4 at 0, 4, and 8 hours. Mg++ levels were measured prior to each MgSO4 dose and 1 and 4 hours after the final dose in both groups. In the single dose group, there was no difference between baseline Mg++ levels and post MgSO4 levels, and only 2/10 developed slightly elevated levels (2.2, 2.3 mEq/L). In the multiple dose group, levels increased and remained significantly higher than baseline after the second MgSO4 dose, and 9/14 developed elevated levels (2.2 to 5.0 mEq/L). All patients who developed elevated Mg++ levels had normal BUN and creatinine values. When the single and multiple dose groups were compared, baseline Mg++ levels were no different (1.68 +/- 0.21 vs 1.69 +/- 0.24, p = 0.952), but peak Mg++ levels were significantly higher in the multiple dose group (1.80 +/- 0.31 vs 2.61 +/- 0.86, p = 0.004). Cases that developed hypermagnesemia had slightly higher baseline Mg++ levels (1.78 +/- 0.22 vs 1.60 +/- 0.19 mEq/L, p = 0.041). In the multiple dose group, higher peak Mg++ levels were noted in cases involving ingestions of anticholinergic or opioid drugs (2.83 vs 1.98, p = 0.025). Hypermagnesemia developed in some cases with normal renal function, blood pressure, and urine output. We conclude that significant hypermagnesemia can occur rapidly after use of multiple dose Mg++ cathartics in standard doses in patients with normal renal function.\r"

Chelating agents were administered for two weeks at doses approximately equal to one-fourth of their respective LD50. Treatment with DFOA, citric, malic or succinic acids significantly increased the fecal and urinary excretion of aluminum and reduced the concentration of aluminum found in various organs and tissues, with citric acid being the most effective. In sight of these results, citric, malic or succinic acids may be considered as alternatives to deferoxamine in aluminum toxicity. However, further investigations are required previous to the possible use of these compounds in human aluminum poisoning.\r"

After intervals of 2 hours (three dogs), 8 days (five dogs), 1 month (six dogs), 2 months (six dogs), or 6 months (five dogs), a bacteremic challenge was produced by intravenous injection of 6 x 10(8) colony-forming units of S. aureus. Two hours later grafts were removed and cut into 10 fragments, each submitted to bacterial counts and scanning electron microscopic studies. Results of bacterial counts were expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per square centimeter of graft segment (median [lower to upper quartiles]). Normal canine aortas (n = 2) used as controls trapped no bacteria. Colonization of Dacron grafts varied according to the duration of graft function (p less than 0.01): after 2 hours, 4416.5 CFU (1158 to 9073 CFU); after 8 days, 1515 CFU (963 to 2893 CFU); after 1 month, 199 CFU (86 to 538 CFU); after 2 months, 615 CFU (243 to 1407 CFU); and after 6 months, 1 CFU (1 to 5 CFU). Heavily colonized fragments were observed for duration of graft function of 2 months or less, whereas at 6 months all the fragments trapped fewer than 50 CFU/cm2 of graft segment. Scanning electron microscopy showed that colonization was closely associated with healing. Staphylococcal entrapment was related to the amount of fibrin deposits, which were especially abundant where the thrombotic matrix was unorganized and on bare polyester filaments. Graft colonization is especially to be feared in the first weeks after graft implantation, an observation which may help to define guidelines for preventing hematogenous vascular graft infection.\r"

The technique proved to be highly correlated (r = 0.88) with wound healing after amputation, at a separating value of 21 mm Hg (p = 0.0001). The study suggests that the value of this noninvasive method will be to enable the surgeon to amputate at a lower level and to diminish complications and failure of rehabilitation.\r"

The elastic-ring graft was implanted in the descending thoracic aortas of nine dogs and was evaluated histologically and angiographically at different intervals from 18 to 150 days. No complication such as detachment of the ring, aortic rupture, stenosis, or aneurysmal dilatation was observed. With the new graft neither ligation nor posterior aortic wall dissection is necessary, and no anastomotic stenosis occurs. This graft is applicable even if the diameter of the aorta is small. Therefore the elastic-ring sutureless intraluminal graft promises theoretic advantages over sutureless methods that use tape ligation.\r"

Male normal and blotchy mice 1 to 8 months of age were killed and latex was injected into the left ventricles to facilitate exposure, examination, histologic sampling, and photography of the aorta. Aneurysms were not detected in any normal animals but the affected animals had a progressive increase in the incidence of aneurysms with age, reaching 100% by 6 months. Most aneurysms occurred in the ascending aorta, with some also present in the descending thoracic and abdominal segments. Some animals had multiple aneurysms. Histologically the blotchy mice aortas exhibited disrupted elastic lamellae and thickening of the interlamellar spaces. These spaces contained conspicuously pleomorphic smooth muscle cells, confirmed by electron microscopy. These changes occurred as early as 21 days, when there was no gross evidence of aneurysmal development. Aortic aneurysms develop in blotchy mice in a consistent fashion, with characteristic gross and histologic changes. These animals provide a practical model for further studies of aneurysmal disease, including possible therapeutic interventions to prevent aneurysm development.\r"

We have designed an in vivo experimental model to evaluate early blood-material interactions within the venous system and to quantitate drug efficacy in the alteration of platelet function and fibrin deposition in the baboon. An 8F catheter was placed percutaneously in the femoral vein of an adult male baboon. Indium 111-labeled autogenous platelets or iodine 125-labeled human fibrinogen was infused before the introduction, into the inferior vena cava, of a linear array of 5 x 15 mm alternating Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene samples attached to a benzalkonium-heparin-treated guide wire. At 60 or 120 minutes the samples were removed and a 1 ml aliquot of blood was drawn. The materials and blood samples were counted in a gamma well counter, and the material counts were normalized to the circulating label present in the 1 ml blood sample. The experiment was repeated after pretreatment with heparin, aspirin, or dextran. Whole blood clotting times and bleeding times were monitored. The results showed decreased platelet and fibrin deposition on polytetrafluoroethylene when compared with Dacron in the venous system. Aspirin, heparin, and dextran were all found to decrease platelet and fibrin deposition onto intravenously placed graft material samples (p less than 0.05, Student's t test). The data confirm the ability of the model to evaluate quantitatively anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and prospective graft materials for use in venous reconstructions.\r"

We report the cases of seven patients in whom anticoagulant therapy was begun with ancrod instead of heparin for one or more of the following reasons: (1) failure to achieve systemic anticoagulation in response to heparin (e.g., antithrombin III deficiency), (2) heparin-associated complications (e.g., thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, or both), and (3) combined anticoagulation and improved blood rheology considered to be potentially more beneficial than anticoagulation alone (e.g., massive thrombosis). In the cases reported, ancrod permitted systemic anticoagulation equal to that of heparin; this was achieved without bleeding complications. In contrast to streptokinase or urokinase, ancrod does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin; consequently hemorrhagic complications are uncommon. Ancrod appears to be an appropriate alternative to heparin and may be preferable to it in certain circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital vascular malformations (CVMs) of the limb include simple and cavernous hemangiomas, microarteriovenous and macroarteriovenous fistulas, venous angiomas, and mixed CVMs. In differentiating these lesions, Doppler waveform analysis, labeled microsphere studies, arteriography, closed-space phlebography, and contrast-enhanced CT scans have all been advocated, but each has significant limitations. This article evaluates the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in characterizing CVMs. Limb CVMs were evaluated by MRI in eight patients: four in the upper and four in the lower extremity. Before MRI, seven of the patients had arteriography, five had phlebography, and five had Doppler waveform analysis. MRI showed a highly cellular network with little arteriovenous flow in five patients. In four of these, arteriography and phlebography confirmed the presence of a predominantly venous or microfistulous anomaly. In the other three patients, MRI demonstrated high-flow arterial and venous channels and were confirmed by arteriography to have macrofistulous arteriovenous malformations. In all eight patients, MRI revealed the anatomic location and the longitudinal and transverse extent of the vascular malformation as well as their relationships with contiguous muscle groups, bones, and vessels. We conclude that CVMs of the limbs can be characterized accurately with MRI, with the anatomic extent, degree of cellularity, and flow characteristics readily gauged. Because MRI provides the same basic information supplied by angiography and the noninvasive laboratory and assesses anatomic extent and cellularity, it serves well as the primary diagnostic test for suspected CVMs, particularly in infants and children in whom competitive tests pose additional limitations.\r"

Fifteen of these injuries (9%) occurred after blunt trauma. In 10 patients the proximal segment (first and second parts) of the artery was involved. No patient had an isolated injury; the most frequent associated injuries were rib fractures (n = 11), with the first rib being involved in four of these. Total brachial plexus disruption was found in nine patients. All patients with distal artery involvement had a clavicular fracture. All had an absent radial pulse and eight had critical ischemia of the hand. Four patients were treated nonoperatively and the remainder were treated along standard lines. Brachial plexus reconstruction was not feasible in any patient. Within 2 weeks of operation, one patient died as a result of head injuries and one required amputation because of sepsis. During a 12-month period, five regained full function, one additional patient requested above-elbow amputation after 6 months, and seven had a flail anesthetic limb. Twelve of these patients were involved in automobile accidents, eight of whom were wearing lap-shoulder harness seat belts with a loose-fitting shoulder strap component that created a characteristic abrasion pattern on the torso and chest. We conclude that the torsionshearing motion allowed by this situation contributed significantly to the pattern of injury and a plea is made for correctly fitted restraining devices.\r"

  ".W": "The brachial artery is not used for long-term catheterization and routine hemodynamic monitoring because a high incidence of ischemic complications is anticipated. However, in a review of 157 patients who had 225 percutaneous transbrachial hepatic artery catheters placed for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents, catheters remained in situ from 1 day to 14 months (median 68 days). One hundred seventy-three catheters (77%) were removed electively and 52 catheters (23%) were removed because of complications. Diminution or loss of the radial pulses occurred on insertion of 88 catheters (39.1%) and 16 of these (8%) were removed after 24 hours because ischemic symptoms developed. Subsequently, 25 other catheters (11.1%) were removed because of complications such as paresthesia, eight (3.5%); brachial artery thrombosis, four (1.7%); microembolization, three (1.3%); claudication, two (0.8%); and pseudoaneurysm, one (0.4%). Seven catheters (3.1%) were removed because of a combination of pallor, diminished pulses, and muscle weakness. Hemorrhage from the arteriotomy site necessitated the removal of 11 other catheters (4.9%). Amputation, ischemic ulceration, major neuromuscular sequelae, and peripheral embolization to the head or lower limbs did not occur. This study suggests that long-term brachial artery catheterization is associated with a low incidence of permanent ischemic complications.\r"

The occupational work evaluation consisted of a symptom-limited treadmill test performed 23 +/- 3 days after myocardial infarction and a formal recommendation to the patient and primary physician that the patient return to work within the next two weeks. The groups did not differ in age, medical status, comorbid disease, occupation type, or years on the job. At six months, 92% of patients receiving the intervention and 88% of patients receiving usual care were working either full- or part-time. Return to full-time work occurred at a median of 51 days in patients receiving the intervention and 75 days in patients receiving usual care. This 32% reduction in the convalescence period was associated with +2102 of additional earned salary per intervention patient in the six months after myocardial infarction. One or more recurrent cardiac events occurred in 14 intervention patients (one death, one nonfatal myocardial infarction, three angioplasties, and nine coronary surgeries) and in 13 usual-care patients (two deaths, three nonfatal myocardial infarctions, six angioplasties, and seven coronary surgeries) in the six months after myocardial infarction. The early return to work of low-risk patients based on an occupational work evaluation is associated with important economic benefits.\r"

Quarterly error rates for each analyte were determined; between one fourth and all of the laboratories that made at least one error during the first two quarters of proficiency testing made at least one more error in the same analyte during the subsequent two quarters. We show that participation in the quarterly proficiency testing program for a 12- to 15-month period did not lead to a measurable increase in performance. For proficiency testing to be effective, we suggest that it be supplemented by additional methods to lower error rates, such as regulation or intensive consultation and training services for personnel of physicians' office laboratories.\r"

In contrast, only one (0.3%) of 286 new patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were seen during the same interval had had a breast implant. This difference was statistically significant and suggests a relationship between silicone augmentation mammoplasty and scleroderma.

They were randomly assigned to either group on a daily sequential basis. Spirometry was performed within one hour of the initial dose of steroids. The mean presenting forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 26% of the predicted value. Spirometry was then repeated every six hours for the first 24 hours and then every eight to 12 hours until discharge or 72 hours, whichever occurred first. There were no significant differences in the incidence of respiratory failure, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, days of hospitalization, rate of improvement in pulmonary function, or side effects. No patient who went into respiratory failure did so more than three hours after receiving the initial dose of steroids.

To evaluate recovery from chronic partial ureteral obstruction (CPUO) in the neonatal period, the left ureter of guinea pigs was constricted within the first 48 hours of life, and the obstruction was relieved 10 days later. At three and eight weeks of age, intraureteral pressure, number of perfused glomeruli (NPG), renal blood flow (RBF), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. These animals were compared with sham-operated and unrelieved groups. Two additional groups underwent CPUO at five weeks of age, with persistent obstruction or relief in 10 days, and were also studied at eight weeks. In all animals, intraureteral pressure increased during ipsilateral ureteral obstruction and normalized following its release. Recovery of RBF and GFR after relief of ipsilateral CPUO in the newborns was only partial at eight weeks, with no renal growth or increase in NPG from three to eight weeks of age. In contrast, recovery of RBF in the adult was complete 10 days after relief of obstruction, with significant increase in GFR, and no decrease in renal mass or NPG. We conclude that if delayed, relief of CPUO in the neonate may not restore renal growth and functional maturation which have been impaired by CPUO.\r"

In the present studies, the possibility that the bile salt sodium taurocholate exerts a direct effect on renal epithelial transport was investigated in vitro. We found that addition of sodium taurocholate to fluid bathing perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules increases hydraulic conductivity (Lp) in a manner similar in time course and significantly less in magnitude to that observed with maximal concentrations of arginine vasopressin. Sodium taurocholate reversibly potentiates rabbit cortical collecting tubular Lp stimulated by maximal concentrations of arginine vasopressin and a nonhydrolyzable cyclic AMP analogue. We also found that sodium taurocholate induces a dose-dependent leak from tubular lumen to bathing fluid of a small molecular weight substance (125I-iothalamate). Our studies suggest that sodium taurocholate increases rabbit cortical collecting tubular Lp by a cyclic AMP independent mechanism.\r"

Albuminuria (UalbV) increased only in LP-HP, from 168 +/- 23 mg/day to 447 +/- 45 mg/day (P less than 0.001). Urinary lysozyme excretion correlated with UalbV (r = 0.737, P less than 0.001), and changes in UlysV correlated with changes in UalbV (r = 0.657, P less than 0.01). To determine whether the increase in UlysV was the direct effect of the change in diet, enalapril 40 mg/kg/day was administered to prevent the increase in UalbV that occurs when these rats are fed a high protein diet. Twelve rats were fed 8.5% (LP) and 10 were fed 40% protein (HP) from the time of injection with antiserum. Six LP (LPE) and five HP (HPE) received enalapril. UlysV was 873 +/- 391 mcg/day in HP and nearly undetectable in the other three groups. UalbV was significantly greater in HP (368 +/- 60 mg/day) compared to the other three groups (114 +/- 16 in LP, 136 +/- 44 in HPE, 95 +/- 21 in LPE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Renal hypertrophy is a common consequence of diabetes mellitus that precedes and possibly accounts for the increased glomerular filtration rate. We have postulated that the glucose-mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium [Na]i initiates the chain of events leading to the increase in cell size and eventually cell number. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic by the intravenous injection of 45 mg/kg body wt of streptozotocin dissolved in a 5 mM citrate buffer solution. Control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. Ninety-six hours and 11 weeks later, measurements of [Na]i were done by NMR spectroscopy on suspensions of proximal tubules, using dysprosium tripolyphosphate as an extracellular shift reagent. At 96 hours after the induction of the diabetes, there was a 60% increase in [Na]i compared to control (P less than 0.01). No further increase in [Na]i was observed during the subsequent 11 weeks of observation. Addition of ouabain (1.0 mM) resulted in a fourfold increase in [Na]i in tubules from control animals, and a 2.5-fold increase in tubules from 96-hour diabetic rats. Ouabain-inhibitable Na+-K+-ATPase activity was substantially higher in the renal tubules of diabetic rats, the increase being proportional to that of [Na]i. In order to ascertain the effect of hyperglycemia on [Na]i, proximal tubules prepared from kidneys of normal and diabetic rats were exposed to low (5 mM) and high (25 mM) concentration of glucose in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we examined the effect of uremia with or without concomitant treatment of hypertension by the converting enzyme Ramipril (125 micrograms/day) on micromorphometric indices of cardiac interstitium at the light microscopical and ultrastructural level. In male SD rats, 21 days of uremia caused an increase of total heart weight (1040 +/- 73 mg wet wt vs. 871 +/- 81 in controls, P less than 0.05) with an increase of both right and left ventricular weight. This was accompanied by reduction of capillary cross-sectional area despite unchanged capillary length. The volume density (cm3/cm3) of cardiomyocytes was unchanged (0.881 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.871 +/- 0.016 in controls), but volume density of interstitial tissue (excluding capillary lumen) was significantly increased (0.042 +/- 0.011 cm3 interstitial tissue/cm3 total heart tissue vs. 0.019 +/- 0.007 in controls). This was associated with signs of activation of interstitial cells, that is, increased volume of interstitial cell nuclei and interstitial cell cytoplasm. Concomitantly, a significant increase of volume density of non-cellular interstitial ground substance was found which was not normalized by antihypertensive treatment using Ramipril. After three months of uremia, electron microscopy showed collagen fiber deposition in the interstitium. Comparable interstitial fibrosis was not observed in hearts of rats with renovascular (one clip-two kidney) hypertension. It is concluded that uremia increases myocardial interstitial ground substance by mechanisms independent of hypertension. The data may be relevant for recent findings of diastolic heart malfunction secondary to impaired compliance in uremic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pretreatment of animals with certain antioxidant enzymes and substances decreases renal damage following ischemia and reperfusion. The hypothesis that reoxygenation imposes an oxidant stress has been used to explain this. The present study has directly assessed oxidant stress under these conditions by measuring the glutathione redox ratio ([GSSG/(GSH + GSSG)] x 100) in freeze-clamped kidney. The glutathione peroxidase system plays a role in removing peroxides which result from oxidant stress, generating GSSG from GSH in the process. The selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase can metabolize H2O2 and other hydroperoxides. A non-selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity is present and can metabolize organic hydroperoxides, but it cannot metabolize H2O2. Under anesthesia, the left renal artery was occluded for 40 minutes and then reflow was allowed. Kidneys were freeze clamped before reflow and after 5, 10, and 15 minutes of reflow. The contralateral kidney was freeze clamped and used as a control. The control value for the glutathione redox ratio was 1.09 +/- 0.05. This fell during ischemia to 0.67 +/- 0.22 and increased significantly to 1.66 +/- 0.29 after five minutes of reperfusion. By 15 minutes it had returned to 1.09 +/- 0.22. Treatment of rats with diquat, which causes a severe oxidant stress, raised the glutathione redox ratio from 0.88 +/- 0.12 to 1.89 +/- 0.15. Thus, reperfusion was concluded to cause a large but transient oxidant stress. Selenium-deficient rats were used to examine the nature of the oxidant stress. Activity of the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase was depressed to 2% of control in the kidneys of these rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to compare the effect of monoclonal antibodies upon binding to three distinct antigenic determinants present in the glomerular capillary wall. Ten monoclonal antibodies were tested for their nephrotoxic capacity in the rat. Six antibodies directed against basement membrane laminin and three antibodies with specificity for a 129/117 kd antigenic complex present on endothelial and glomerular visceral epithelial cell surfaces did not induce proteinuria or structural injury. A non-complement binding monoclonal antibody that immunoprecipitates a 115/107 kd sialo-glycoprotein (SGP-115/107) from glomerular cell membrane preparations and a 107 kd component from proximal tubules, intestinal cells and liver cells, induces glomerular epithelial cell alterations consisting of focal obliteration of foot process architecture, vacuolar changes in the cytoplasm, microvillous transformation of the cell surface, and focal retraction of podocytes, resulting in detachment of the epithelium from the underlying basement membrane. These structural changes are accompanied by immediate transient proteinuria only in animals given complete Freund's adjuvant at the time of antibody administration. These studies indicate that direct antibody-mediated glomerular injury can be induced in the rat by administration of monoclonal antibodies specific for cell associated antigens.\r"

Following administration of either intravenous GSH to increase renal GSH or intraperitoneal diethylmaleate to decrease renal GSH, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 60 minutes of renal ischemia. In animals with high renal GSH following GSH infusion, GFR 24 hours after ischemia was 0.43 +/- 0.08 ml/min compared to 0.15 +/- 0.02 ml/min in saline-infused control animals (P less than 0.01). When renal GSH was decreased by the administration of diethylmaleate postischemic renal dysfunction was accentuated. Twenty-four hours after ischemia GFR was 0.05 +/- 0.02 ml/min in diethylmaleate-treated animals and 0.28 +/- 0.06 ml/min in control animals (P less than 0.005). To test whether a decrease in renal transport work alters renal GSH the filtered load of sodium was reduced by producing unilateral renal artery stenosis. Alternatively, renal work was lessened when sodium reabsorption was interfered with by the infusion of a combination of natriuretic agents. Renal artery stenosis produced a 37% decrease in GFR. Renal GSH was 0.435 +/- 0.089 nmol/mg protein in intact kidneys and 0.804 +/- 0.239 nmol/mg protein in stenotic kidneys (P less than 0.05). The infusion of natriuretic agents produced no change in GFR or renal plasma flow but resulted in a striking elevation in renal GSH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused an increase in [Ca]i by 23.4 +/- 2.7% over a 10 minute period. There was a significant increase in [Ca]i within two minutes of the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased [Ca]i in a dose-dependent manner and this occurred with as little as 10(-10) M. Neither 10(-7) M 25-(OH)D3 nor 10(-7) M 24, 25-(OH)2D3 caused a significant increase in [Ca]i. Chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA blocked the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increase in [Ca]i, suggesting that the increase was mainly from extracellular calcium. Neither 10(-5) M verapamil nor 10(-4) M diltiazem blocked the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increase in [Ca]i. The present data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 might modify membrane permeability to calcium independent of voltage-dependent calcium channels sensitive to verapamil or diltiazem. The rapid effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 raises the possibility that its mechanism is independent of genome activation, perhaps attributable to direct interaction with components of the parathyroid cell plasma membrane.\r"

Micropuncture measurements were repeated to measure single nephron GFR (SNGFR) and glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC) in the same nephrons, and subsequently examine the morphology of these glomeruli by serial section histological analysis. Using this approach, a potential causal link between early functional pattern and late structural abnormalities was examined in glomeruli of 10 Munich-Wistar rats up to six weeks after surgical removal of 5/6 total renal mass. After two weeks all SNGFR and PGC values increased uniformly but to varying degrees within each remnant kidney. Thereafter, values for SNGFR were highly variable, many declining while other increased in the same kidney. PGC showed an initial increase with subsequent decrease by four to six weeks. Serial section histological analysis of these same glomeruli revealed that the extent of glomerular sclerosis positively correlated with the functional deterioration, that is, the degree of reduction in SNGFR (P less than 0.01). However, the degree of sclerosis had no tendency to correlate with the levels of SNGFR or PGC recorded in early stage. These studies indicate that pathophysiologic mechanisms other than, or in addition to, early hyperfunction are involved in determining the extent of glomerular structural damage in this model of chronic renal failure.\r"

Quenching studies using antibodies to tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase revealed that the extracted glomerular plasminogen activator activity contained both tissue plasminogen activator of urokinase. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised to tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated low-level inhibition of urokinase activity and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to urokinase demonstrated low-level inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator activity. The assay should be applicable to the study of glomerular plasminogen activator activity in experimental and human kidney diseases. The detection of antibody cross-reactivity to tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase may be related to the sensitivity of the 125I-fibrin assay and to the structural similarities of these activators.\r"

In order to assess the role of hemodynamic and intrarenal physical factors upon natriuretic response to central volume expansion, two hour water immersion (WI) experiments were made in six uncomplicated essential hypertensives and six normotensive healthy controls. Before and during WI we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine flow (V/min), sodium (UNaV) and potassium (UKV) excretion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and intrarenal (wedged) venous pressure (IRVP). In comparison with normotensive controls, the exaggerated natriuretic response in hypertensives (P less than 0.05 for UNaV during WI) was associated with an enhanced vasodilating response as demonstrated by a greater increase in ERPF (P less than 0.05) and by a more pronounced fall in calculated renal precapillary resistances (P less than 0.05). A more significant increase in IRVP was found in hypertensive group (P less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not change in either group during WI. MAP, unchanged in normotensives, was significantly reduced in hypertensives (P less than 0.05), while remaining in the hypertensive range. These findings suggest that intrarenal physical factors play a major role in determining the exaggerated natriuresis during WI in hypertensive man.\r"

Angiographic findings in 30 patients with symptoms of angina were progression of the coronary artery disease in 22, (73%, confidence limits 56% to 91%), occluded or stenosed grafts in nine (30%, confidence limits 12% to 48%), and nonbypassed obstructions in six patients (20%, confidence limits 4% to 36%).

Unligated side branches and stenosis of the internal mammary artery did not prevent long-term graft patency. Internal mammary artery graft failures were related to technical errors during the operation and occurred when the internal mammary artery was used to bypass a low-grade coronary artery stenosis. In one patient, regression of a coronary artery stenosis was associated with a marked decrease in luminal size of the internal mammary artery graft before the 5-year follow-up. This single internal mammary artery graft became occluded in the interval between 5 and 11 years after the operation. Eleven of 36 internal mammary artery grafts (31%, confidence limits 14% to 47%) increased 15% to 40% in luminal diameter as a result of increased myocardial blood demand before the 11-year follow-up.\r"

The hazard function (instantaneous risk of dying) was greatest immediately after operation and declined thereafter, but a low constant hazard persisted for as long as the patients were followed up. Multivariately, the postrepair ratio between peak right ventricular and left ventricular pressures measured in the operating room provided the most information relative to the probability of death after repair, and cardiopulmonary bypass time the next. When morphologic abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation were considered in the multivariate analysis for risk factors for death, the size of the pulmonary arteries provided the most information, followed by the number of large aortopulmonary collateral arteries. The postrepair peak right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio was lower the day after operation than in the operating room in 65% of the patients in whom the measurements were made. Recurrent or residual ventricular septal defects necessitating rerepair occurred in four patients (3% of hospital survivors). Most surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I at the time of follow-up. INFERENCES: Early, intermediate, and long-term survival is less good after repair of tetralogy with pulmonary atresia than after repair of tetralogy with pulmonary stenosis. This is related primarily to the greater prevalence of high peak right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio measured in the operating room in the former group. Both the postrepair peak right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio in the operating room and the probability of death are inversely related to the size of the pulmonary arteries and directly to the number of large aortopulmonary collateral arteries. This and inferences from other risk factors may be helpful in achieving better results in the future.\r"

The sources of infection were intravenous drugs in six patients, central catheters in two, and malformations in four. Preoperatively, 10 of 12 (83%) of these patients were in class III or IV. Reparative or reconstructive approaches, including valvuloplasty, were attempted for all these right-sided endocarditis lesions and were hemodynamically effective in 10 of 12 (83%) patients. The low right-sided intracardiac pressures and the three-leaflet configuration (one pulmonary and nine tricuspid valves) have lent themselves to this approach. Extensive annular invasion and multileaflet infections were technical limitations in the remaining patients. The overall outcome was favorable during the mean follow-up period of 25 months (hospital mortality 1/12, 8.3%; late death 1/11, 9%). Reparative or reconstructive approaches for right-sided infective endocarditis should be considered and can be successfully achieved. Their advantages include (1) improved hemodynamics, (2) low recurrence, and (3) favorable long-term results without staged or simultaneous prosthetic valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Since June 1983 we have developed a stratified regimen for staged implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator system. The protocol for management in patients who have fully recovered from sudden cardiac death is initiated with the use of standard electrophysiologic evaluation. Treatment in order of application has consisted of drugs followed by implantation of the device for patients with drug-refractory arrhythmias in whom direct cardiac surgical intervention for anatomic substrates for sudden death are absent. In surgical candidates, combinations of coronary revascularization and ablative therapy have been used to mitigrate the potential for lethal arrhythmia. Sensing and defibrillator lead systems have been placed at corrective operations to be followed later by implantation of the cardioverter defibrillator generator for either inducible or spontaneous tachyarrhythmia. This staged application has been effective in markedly reducing actual sudden cardiac death while at the same time saving on unnecessary device implantation. Morbidity of lead implantation alone remains a concern, particularly for infective complications. Additional follow-up is required to assess the validity of this approach.\r"

  ".U": "88260283\r", 
  ".W": "Acute in vitro histologic studies have shown that the pulsed xenon chloride excimer laser causes precise microablation without the surrounding thermal tissue injury associated with frequently used continuous-wave lasers such as the argon, carbon dioxide, and neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet lasers. However, the in vivo healing response of artery wall to excimer laser injury is not known. Accordingly, a xenon chloride excimer laser (308 nm, 40 nsec pulse width, 39 mJ/mm2/pulse) was transmitted via a 600 micron fused silica fiber to create 420 craters of varying depths (30 to 270 micron) in 21 normal canine femoral and carotid arteries. At 2 hours, 2 days, 10 days, and 42 days after excimer laser ablation, the artery segments were perfusion fixed in situ and analyzed by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. At 2 hours, craters were covered by a carpet of platelets and entrapped red blood cells. Fibrin and exposed collagen fibers were seen at the crater base. There was a sharp demarcation of the crater-artery wall interface without lateral laser tissue injury. At 2 days, adherent platelets persisted with thrombus covering the base of the craters. Early healing responses were present, consisting of polymorphonucleated leukocytes and new endothelial cells, which extended over the crater rims. At 10 days, no thrombi were seen, and healing continued with almost complete reendothelialization. Macrophages, fibroblasts, fibrin, and entrapped red blood cells were present below the reendothelialized surface. At 42 days, healing was complete with obliteration of the craters by fibrointimal ingrowth. The surface was completely covered by a smooth monolayer of axially aligned endothelial cells. There were no aneurysms or surface hyperplastic responses. These favorable healing responses in normal canine arteries suggest that pulsed lasers with high tissue absorption coefficients, such as the xenon chloride excimer laser, may be suitable energy sources for clinical laser angioplasty procedures. However, further studies in atherosclerotic animals are required before human clinical responses can be accurately predicted.\r"

  ".W": "In January 1983, symptomatic Pseudomonas cepacia bacteremia developed in two patients in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit within 3 days after cardiac operation and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. An epidemiologic and microbiologic investigation revealed that both patients required intra-aortic balloon pumping for circulatory support and that the water reservoir of the intra-aortic balloon pump (SMEC, Inc., Cookeville, Tenn.) contained more than 10(5) Pseudomonas cepacia per milliliter. This organism was also recovered from the purge button and on-off switch of the pump and from the hands of a health care worker who manipulated the water reservoir of the intra-aortic balloon pump. Agarose gel electrophoresis of lysates of Pseudomonas cepacia with rapid methods of deoxyribonucleic acid preparation revealed three identical plasmids of the Pseudomonas cepacia from the water reservoir of the intra-aortic balloon pump and from the infected patients. Transmission from the worker's hands to patients presumably occurred by inoculation of the intravascular lines during management. No additional cases of Pseudomonas cepacia bacteremia were observed after the unit was replaced with a nonwater reservior intra-aortic balloon pump. This report substantiates the ability of Pseudomonas cepacia to multiply in water and to cause epidemic bacteremia, identifies the water reservoir of the SMEC intra-aortic balloon pump as a previously unrecognized hazard for the patient requiring intra-aortic balloon pumping, and documents the value of plasmid analysis in elucidating the mode of transmission of nosocomial Pseudomonas cepacia infections.\r"

  ".W": "Between October 1983 and April 1987, 20 patients with malignant mesothelioma underwent computed tomography scans of the chest and upper abdomen to evaluate the extent of disease before treatment. Twelve of these 20 patients deemed to have some potential for long-term survival had scans performed every 3 months after operation to help detect recurrent disease. Anatomic correlation of computed tomography scan findings was available in all 20 patients. The limitations of computed tomography in initial evaluation were its difficulties in assessing (1) chest wall involvement (nine patients), (2) mediastinal lymph nodes (four patients), (3) transdiaphragmatic extension of tumor (four patients), and (4) peritoneal studding and solid organ metastases less than 2 mm in size (one patient). Computed tomography was helpful in detecting recurrent disease in the 12 patients having long-term follow-up. In six of eight cases with histologically proved recurrence, computed tomography detected tumors from 1 to 8 months before the onset of signs or symptoms. Although computed tomography is known to provide far more information about the extent of disease than plain radiographs, it remains an imperfect tool for the staging of disease in patients with malignant mesothelioma. Despite its limitations, computed tomography is probably the most accurate way to provide follow-up for patients during treatment.\r"

  ".U": "88260294\r", 
  ".W": "Percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy has recently been developed as an alternative to surgical commissurotomy for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. We analyzed our initial experience with 60 consecutive procedures performed in 49 patients over 1 1/2 years and identified factors influencing the immediate hemodynamic results. For the total patient population, the mitral valve area increased after percutaneous mitral valvotomy from 0.8 +/- 0.04 to 1.6 +/- 0.11 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Mean diastolic mitral gradient fell from 18 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and cardiac output increased from 3.8 +/- 0.2 to 4.5 +/- 0.2 L/min (p less than 0.01). Although percutaneous mitral valvotomy resulted in an increase in mitral valve area in each patient, a suboptimal result, as defined by a postprocedure mitral valve area of 1.0 cm2 or less, an increase in area of 25% or less, or a final mitral gradient of 10 mm Hg or more occurred in 21 of the 60 procedures (35%). Multivariate analysis of 16 variables was performed to determine which factors might predict this result. Patients with a suboptimal result were more likely to have severe valve leaflet thickening or immobility and an extreme degree of subvalvular thickening and calcification on echocardiogram. Other factors that predicted a suboptimal result were a smaller effective balloon dilating area and the presence of atrial fibrillation. Thus optimal immediate hemodynamic results can be obtained in the majority of patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valvotomy. Optimal results may be expected in patients in normal sinus rhythm, with pliable mitral leaflets, and with no severe subvalvular disease identified by echocardiography, who undergo dilation with large effective balloon dilating areas.\r"

The mean pressure in the left atrium decreased from 27 +/- 2 mm Hg to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) immediately after successful valvotomy. There was no significant further drop in left atrial pressure (or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) over 24 hours. Mean cardiac output increased from 3.9 +/- 0.3 L/min to 4.6 +/- 0.3 L/min immediately after successful valvotomy (p less than 0.01). Cardiac output continued to rise for the next 8 hours and plateaued during the 24-hour period of observation. Pulmonary vascular resistance dropped immediately after the relief of mitral valve obstruction in all patients. In the group of patients who had elevated pulmonary vascular resistance after valvotomy, resistance continued to drop significantly (p less than 0.05) over the next 24 hours. In some cases it did not fall to normal levels despite adequate relief of mitral stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Improvements in mechanical support for profound circulatory collapse have resulted in increasing survival of these critically ill patients. Since 1980, 27 patients aged 3 days to 69 years (mean 34.9 years) who required mechanical circulatory assistance have been followed up after discharge from the hospital. The refractory cardiogenic shock necessitating mechanical support occurred postoperatively in 22 patients (coronary artery bypass in nine, valve replacement in four, correction of congenital heart defects in nine) and with end-stage cardiomyopathy in five. Fourteen patients were supported with a Pierce-Donachy ventricular assist device (left ventricular assist in seven, right ventricular assist in three, both in four); nine were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, two with a Medtronic centrifugal left ventricular assist pump, one with biventricular Biomedicus pumps, and one with a Novacor left ventricular assist system. The duration of support ranged from 8 hours to 91 days with a mean of 3.5 days in patients supported for postoperative shock. Major complications occurred in 18 patients (67%), including bleeding that necessitated operative exploration in 14, serious infection in five, renal failure in two, and stroke in two. The five patients with cardiomyopathy underwent cardiac transplantation. The remaining 22 patients who had postoperative cardiogenic shock were weaned from support. There have been four late deaths: two cardiac related at 6 months and two of cancer at 46 and 53 months (one patient was in New York Heart Association class I and the other in class II before death). The remaining 23 survivors have been followed up for 3 to 79 months (mean 29 months) and at last examination 17 (74%) were in class I, two (9%) were in class II, three (13%) were in class III, and one (4%) was in class IV. Eight patients are employed full time, three are retired, four attend school, three are in preschool, one is a housewife, and one is unemployed but free of symptoms. Only four patients have significant cardiac disability, and one of these still works. In conclusion, mechanical circulatory assistance allows adequate support to permit satisfactory long-term survival in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock.\r"

Isolated in situ pig hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of hypothermic potassium (35 mEq) crystalloid cardioplegic arrest followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. The experimental group received nicotinic acid 0.08 mmol/L 15 minutes before cardioplegic arrest, whereas the control group received 15 minutes of unmodified perfusion. There was a marked decline in myocardial creatine phosphate levels during cardioplegic arrest in both groups that returned to the baseline level during reperfusion without a significant intergroup difference, and adenosine triphosphate levels remained stable throughout the experiment in both groups. Myocardial oxygen consumption during reperfusion was significantly higher in hearts treated with nicotinic acid, which was consistent with a significantly greater cardiac contractile force as evaluated by isovolumetric left ventricular pressure measurements. There appeared to be less cardiac membrane damage as measured by creatine kinase release during reperfusion, which was significantly inhibited by treatment with nicotinic acid. The present study supports the conclusion that nicotinic acid improves cardiac performance after hypothermic cardioplegic arrest.\r"

  ".W": "We used real-time measurement of the tricuspid valve annular area in anesthetized dogs to study the optimal size of the annular area for annuloplasty. During control conditions, the maximum tricuspid annular area appeared at the onset of ventricular systole. The minimum tricuspid annular area appeared between the ventricular isovolumic relaxation phase and the early ventricular filling phase. The maximum annular area varied in seven dogs between 2.18 and 3.10 cm2, and the minimum annular area ranged between 1.68 and 2.45 cm2. In regular sinus rhythm (heart rates 97 to 120 beats/min), the maximal decreases in tricuspid annular area during one cardiac cycle ranged from 14.3% to 23.6% of the maximum size. When the tricuspid annular area after the annuloplasty was kept larger than the minimum area that was observed during the cardiac cycle in the control study, cardiac output and right atrial pressure remained unchanged, as a result of unobstructed ventricular filling. On the other hand, when the annular area was reduced to smaller than the minimum area seen in the control study, a decrease in cardiac output and an elevation of right atrial pressure ensued. These findings suggest that the tricuspid annular area can be safely decreased by annuloplasty to the minimum area seen in the control study without causing a reduction of cardiac output or an elevation of right atrial pressure.\r"

Various surgical techniques, either repair or replacement of the abnormal tricuspid valve, have been used with variable results. In an attempt to enlarge the indications of conservative procedures, we developed a technique of repair that comprises the reconstruction of a normally shaped right ventricle and the repositioning of the tricuspid valve at the normal level. In a series of 14 patients operated on between January 1980 and December 1986 in our institution, only one patient with an associated atrioventricular septal defect required a tricuspid valve replacement. All of the other patients, regardless of the complexity of the tricuspid malformation, were able to benefit from this conservative technique. There were two hospital deaths and no late deaths in this series. All surviving patients displayed a marked improvement over their preoperative status with regard to functional class (92% are in class I or II) and rhythm disturbances. Echocardiographic and Doppler studies demonstrated a normal shape of the right ventricle and good tricuspid valve function in all the patients but one.\r"

At 1 year, the permanent rate of cessation of smoking was 22%, and permanent cessation continued to occur at least through 6 years of follow-up. Factors related to a higher rate of cessation of smoking were a white-collar occupation, having previously stopped smoking for more than 1 month or more than 1 year, being male, and wanting to stop smoking because of health concerns. In the absence of an almost complete return of questionnaires, sole reliance on mailed self-reports would have substantially overestimated the smoking-cessation rates. Although smoking-cessation programs alone involve relatively few smokers, analysis of the methods used in programs such as the one described continues to be important for the development of successful efforts to help people stop smoking.\r"

In this study, we report our experience with bioassay of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) based on measurement of generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in a clone of the Fisher rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) in 279 patients, and we compare, in 163 consecutive samples, the results obtained by a radioreceptor assay for thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII). Among the untreated, hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease, TSI were present in 95% (38 of 40), and TBII were present in 85% (17 of 20). In patients with euthyroid Graves' disease, TSI were found in 57% (16 of 28), and TBII were present in 41% (7 of 17). Of 49 nongoitrous and euthyroid controls, only 4% had TSI and 3% had TBII. Extremely high TSI indices were found in all patients who had pretibial dermopathy (N = 10) or severe Graves' ophthalmopathy (N = 19) requiring orbital decompression. We conclude that both assays are highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing Graves' disease. The TSI bioassay was more sensitive (P less than 0.001) than the TBII radioreceptor assay in detection of Graves' disease. In our experience, both assays have proved useful in the diagnosis of euthyroid Graves' disease with ophthalmopathy and atypical manifestations of hyperthyroid Graves' disease.\r"

  ".W": "The term \"penetrating aortic ulcer\" refers to an ulceration of an atheromatous plaque that extends deeply through the intima and into the aortic media. It may precipitate an intramedial dissection (usually localized) or may rupture into the adventitia to form a pseudoaneurysm. The typical patient with penetrating atheromatous aortic ulcer is elderly and has hypertension, atherosclerosis, and back or chest pain, but pulse deficit, stroke, aortic insufficiency, and compromise of a visceral vessel are not present. Classic aortic dissection and symptomatic thoracic aortic aneurysms are among possibilities in the differential diagnosis. Aortography demonstrates the presence of an aortic ulcer similar in appearance to gastric ulcers seen on barium examination; in addition, an intramural aortic hematoma may be present. Our experience with penetrating aortic ulcers in symptomatic patients indicates that conservative medical therapy leads to recurrence of symptoms and a need for surgical intervention. We present a case that illustrates the salient features of this distinct clinical entity.\r"

  ".U": "88260434\r", 
  ".W": "The specific molecular affinity of the normal plasma protein, serum amyloid P component (SAP), for all known types of amyloid fibrils was used to develop a new general diagnostic method for in-vivo radionuclide imaging of amyloid deposits. After intravenous injection of 123I-labelled purified human SAP there was specific uptake into amyloid deposits in all affected patients, 7 with systemic AL amyloid, 5 with AA amyloid, and 2 with beta 2M amyloid, in contrast to the complete absence of any tissue localisation in 5 control subjects. Distinctive high-resolution scintigraphic images, even of minor deposits in the carpal regions, bone marrow, or adrenals, were obtained. This procedure should yield much information on the natural history and the management of amyloidosis, the presence of which has hitherto been confirmed only by biopsy. Clearance and metabolic studies indicated that, in the presence of extensive amyloidosis, the rate of synthesis of SAP was greatly increased despite maintenance of normal plasma levels. Furthermore, once localised to amyloid deposits the 123I-SAP persisted for long periods and was apparently protected from its normal rapid degradation. These findings shed new light on the pathophysiology of amyloid and may have implications for therapeutic strategies based upon specific molecular targeting with SAP.\r"

Such antibodies were absent in cases showing chronic evolution and were found in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B cases, with no relation to liver disease activity. In acute infection anti-pre-S2 became detectable when maximum liver damage had already occurred and was still detectable in 30% of the cases tested 5-7 years after recovery, as well as in 40% of healthy individuals with naturally acquired immunity to HBV. 10 out of 20 recipients of a plasma-derived, pre-S2-containing, HB vaccine acquired anti-pre-S2 and had no evidence of concurrent liver damage or of autoimmune reactions to human albumin or of suppression of the anti-HBs response. These findings indicate that the antibody response to pre-S2 is a marker of HBV clearance and has no role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related liver damage.\r"

This proliferation of terminology is unnecessary and adds to the confusion surrounding the aetiology of myelinolysis.\r"
