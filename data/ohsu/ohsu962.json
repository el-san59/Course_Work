  ".W": "In order to compare the Azure A Assay to other commonly accepted measures of heparinization, samples of fresh donor sheep blood were prepared with known levels of heparin between 0 and 9 U/ml. For each sample, two determinations of the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) and Whole Blood Partial Thromboplastin Time (WBPTT) were performed. Similarly, an Azure A Assay standard curve of absorbance versus heparin concentration was constructed for the same blood. Three replicates of the procedure were performed, and the average relative error in each assay was computed as the 95% confidence interval on the regression line divided by the slope of the regression curve. Parallel studies were also performed to assess the effect of various plasma constituents on the Azure Assay. Results indicate that all of the assays are equally accurate for heparin levels at or below 2 U/ml, while the ACT and Azure assays are equivalent at heparin levels near 4 U/ml, but the WBPTT is not usable at concentrations above 2 U/ml. The Azure Assay is not sensitive enough for very low heparin levels (less than 1 U/ml), but it is quite accurate and, indeed, is the only rapid assay for heparin concentrations higher than 4 U/ml. In the sensitivity studies, variations in albumin levels and plasma platelet count were shown to have a significant effect on the accuracy of the Azure assay, whereas calcium levels had no effect.\r"

  ".U": "91069790\r", 
  ".W": "rHuEPO was administered to eight patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and uremia (U) for 1 year. Creatinine Clearance (GFR) averaged 14.3 (9-25) ml/min at an Hct of 28% (26-30). Baseline RBC survival by 51Cr T1/2 was highly correlated with GFR (r = 0.66), p less than 0.05 (2), average 21.6 days. Repeat 51Cr T1/2 at 3 months with GFR 10 ml/min at Hct 38% was prolonged by 7 days to 28.6 (p less than 0.005), and at 1 year remained increased to 28 days (p less than 0.001) with Hct 39%, despite further decreased GFR to less than 4 ml/min and need for dialysis. Reticulocytes varied from 1.6% to 7.4 (3-6 weeks) to 3.1 (3 months) and 1.5% (1 year). Bone marrow cellularity increased from 36% to 47% (3 months) and 44% (1 year). M:E ratio decreased from 3.9:1 to 1.7:1 (3 months) to 1.6:1 (1 year). Marrow iron decreased from 4.1/6 to 2.4/6 (3 months) to 1.8/6 (1 year). Doses of rHuEPO had to be reduced to avoid polycythemia. rHuEPO stimulates erythropoiesis in pts with progressive CRF and U for 1 year. The initial increase in hematocrit is due to the early peak of reticulocytes. At 3 months, rHuEPO maintains the increased hematocrit by three mechanisms: 1) increased reticulocytosis, 2) a trend to increased bone marrow erythroid cellularity, and 3) lengthened RBC survival. At 1 year of rHuEPO therapy, the trend to increased marrow cellularity persists, however, the maintenance of target hematocrit is via a lengthened RBC survival. Despite progression of CRF and U, rHuEPO produced RBCs with longer survival than expected. RBC membranes may have been stabilized by rHuEPO.\r"

A cone and plate viscometer was adapted for continuous recording of both light transmission and fluorescence intensity. Citrated platelet rich plasma was incubated with Indo-1AM at a concentration of 10 microns for 30 min at 37 degrees C, then applied to the albumin density gradient to prepare washed platelets. To Indo-1AM loaded washed platelets, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor (vWf) were added, with 1 mM CaCl2. Platelets were then exposed to changing shear stress (6-108 dynes/cm2) for simultaneous measurement of aggregation and [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i in resting platelets was estimated as approximately 100 nM. At low shear stress (10-20 dynes/cm2), [Ca2+]i did not change. In contrast, a marked increase in [Ca2+]i was observed concurrent with aggregation at high shear stress (100-108 dynes/cm2). However, no increase was seen in the presence of 1 mM EGTA. The increase was prevented by monoclonal antibodies against GPIb or vWf, which inhibited vWf binding to GPIb. A monoclonal anti-vWf antibody, which inhibited vWf binding to the GPIIb/IIIa complex, did not affect [Ca2+]i increase during high shear induced platelet aggregation. These results suggest that binding of vWf to GPIb may trigger Ca2+ influx.\r"

Filling characteristics of the Novacor LVAS were examined during the first 48 hours after implantation in 14 patients. Fill volume of the pump was reduced in pathologic states, such as cardiac tamponade, and following the initiation of right ventricular mechanical circulatory support. In addition, multiple regression analysis revealed that right ventricular function measured by the amount of inotropic support required, the right ventricular ejection fraction, and the total pulmonary resistance, significantly predicted left ventricular assist pump fill volume during the first 48 hours of support. Flow visualization simulating these clinical conditions of incomplete filling suggest inadequate valve washing, particularly around the inlet valve and its conduit, which may predispose to thrombus formation.\r"

The system is comprised of a pneumatic sack-type pump (Nippon Zeon Co.), and its driving console (Aishin Seiki Co.). The stroke volume of the pump is 40 ml and blood contacting surfaces are coated with Cardiothane. Ages of the patients (pts) ranged from 12-82 yrs (mean 58 yrs). VASs were used in the assist mode of LVAD (54 pts), RVAD (5 pts) and BVAD (2 pts). Most of the cases (58 pts) included postocardiotomy cardiogenic shock after surgery for ischemic (28 pts), valvular (22 pts), both ischemic and valvular (7 pts) and congenital (1 pt) heart diseases. Average duration of the assist ranged from 1 hr-20 days (mean 5.6 dys). The VADs could be weaned in 34 cases (56%) and among these, 13 cases (21%) survived to discharge from the hospital. Causes of death in cases which could be weaned from the VAD included multiple organ failure/due to delayed institution of adequate circulatory support, renal failure and systemic infection. Small and minute thrombus formations were noted in 7 cases however, no pump originated thromboembolism were complicated. No troubles of the pump including leakage nor breakage, no mechanical failures of the driving consoles were experienced in any of the cases. Thus, it is concluded that the system was proved to be clinically effective and reliable.\r"

The authors' original LVAS has excellent antithrombogenicity to reduce this risk, but thrombus formation in a natural left ventricle (LV) is another risk factor for systemic embolization. We used our LVAS in 22 patients. Of these, LV wall motion was studied in 15, and a smoke-like echo disclosed thrombus in the LV in eight. When LVAS sufficiently supported the systemic circulation, LV wall motion was irregular upon closure of the aortic valve. Upon recovery of LV function and decrease of LVAS flow, the smoke-like echo diminished and LV thrombus decreased in one, but LV thrombus remained unchanged or increased in seven. Systemic administration of antithrombotic agents had an unclear effect. Seven of eight patients with LV thrombus on echo died during or after LVAS. In these seven, a high incidence of LV thrombus (71%), and systemic embolism to the brain (29%) or kidney (86%), were revealed at necropsy. We subsequently used local heparinization to prevent LV thrombus formation. One patient with a smoke-like echo had no evidence of LV thrombus or systemic embolism. During LV assist, careful management of the LVAS, and intra-LV heparinization should be considered to reduce the risk of thrombus formation in the natural LV.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin response of available prototype hollow fiber bioartificial pancreas devices remains unacceptably slow. Although previous experimental and theoretical investigations provide insight into the factors governing the performance of these devices, there are currently no results on the effects of beta cell distribution on insulin response. The authors have developed a detailed theoretical model for insulin response in a hollow fiber bioartificial pancreas. Model predictions have been shown to be in good agreement with literature data on the insulin release from an in vitro hollow fiber device. In this study, model simulations were used to evaluate the effects of axial and radial variations in beta cell density on the insulin response. For a device with no convective recirculation (i.e., a diffusion controlled device), the radical distribution of cells in the matrix and shell plays a critical role in determining device response, but the insulin response is essentially independent of the axial beta cell distribution. In contrast, for a device with substantial recirculation, there is a very strong dependence on the axial beta cell distribution, with a weaker dependence upon the radial distribution. These results clearly demonstrate the potential importance of beta cell distribution in the analysis of in vivo and in vitro experimental data, and in the design of effective clinical devices.\r"

To better define the usefulness of LRF in evaluating the effectiveness of intracoronary thrombolysis with this device, several cardiovascular variables were examined in rabbits during ischemia followed by reperfusion. The rabbits underwent cytoapheresis with LRF (n = 5) and were compared with controls without LRF (n = 5). LRF was composed of a nonwoven polyester fabric (1.8 microns, 4.6 gm). Removal of leukocytes and platelets by LRF was 98% for both. A period of 30 min equilibration was allowed before any experimental intervention, at which time the diagonal artery was occluded for 20 min and then reperfused. All arrhythmias were defined and quantified in accordance with the Lambeth Convention. Regional wall thickening was examined by a pulsed Doppler dimension system. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic variables between the two groups; however, rabbits treated with a LRF demonstrated greater regional wall thickening (LRF group: 17 +/- 0.9%, control group: 11 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.01), as well as significant improvement in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias (LRF group: 12.5%, control group: 47.2%, p less than 0.01). The data suggest that LRF may help prevent arrhythmias, and preserve left ventricular contraction, during and after intracoronary thrombolysis.\r"

Due to the porous structure of the substrate material, hepatocytes were able to penetrate the reticulated pores of the PVF resin, and adhere to and spread on its surface. The densities of hepatocytes attained with PVF were about 10 times as high as those in the monolayer culture using conventional collagen coated Petri dishes. Hepatocytes immobilized in the PVF resin showed viability, as assessed by glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity in the medium. Perfusion culture with PVF resin showed stable, high level metabolism, ammonium removal, and urea secretion comparable to the monolayer culture. It is concluded that perfusion culture with PVF resin is useful in attaining a high density culture of hepatocytes.\r"

In this study of the graft, the antithrombogenicity and healing process was evaluated at an early stage after implantation. Fresh sheep carotid artery (3mm ID) was obtained and cross-linked with polyepoxy compounds, and then used as a small caliber vascular graft. The graft was white and soft. Six cm segments of the graft were implanted into the carotid arteries bilaterally in nine dogs. Sodium heparin was given during the surgery, but no anticoagulant was used postoperatively. Fifteen grafts from eight dogs were removed from 1 hr to 30 days after implantation, and 13 of 15 grafts were found to be patent. Two grafts, one at 3 days, and the other at 14 days, were occluded. The anastomotic area of the occluded grafts felt hard when touched from the outside. In one dog, the grafts were shown angiographically to be patent at 14 days after implantation, and this dog was kept for long-term observation. Macroscopically, no thrombus was observed on any of the patent grafts. Microscopically, the inner surface near the anastomotic lines was covered with endothelial cells, and infiltration of fibroblasts was observed from the outside 7 days after implantation. No foreign body reactions were seen around the graft. After 30 days of implantation, a thin layer of plasma protein at the middle of the graft was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From these observations, it was concluded that the grafts exhibited satisfactory early antithrombogenicity and healing after implantation.\r"

The microporous and FN treated synthetic substrates have been shown to aid in the induction of cellular differentiation mechanisms. Cells were studied under proliferative and nonproliferative growth conditions. The thrombogenicity of the surface created by the endothelial cell monolayers under various experimental conditions was determined using an enzyme based assay of fibrin deposition. Actively proliferating cells on the solid plastic substrate produced the most thrombogenic surface, while confluent endothelial cell monolayers grown on FN treated microporous substrate were the least thrombogenic surfaces. These data suggest that endothelial cell surface thrombogenicity is under substrate control, and also related to the cellular differentiation status. These findings are being used to design a novel approach to the small diameter synthetic vascular graft problem.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cell attachment to a synthetic substrate was studied using an in vitro model system. Attachment rate was defined as the number of tritium-labeled endothelial cells attached to a synthetic substrate after 30 minutes. The surface of the synthetic substrate was chemically modified with either laminin or fibronectin. Labeled endothelial cells attached more rapidly to synthetic substrate, chemically modified with biomolecules, as compared with the untreated substrate controls. Unlabeled endothelial cells were grown to confluency on a second set of modified and untreated substrates. The cells were removed with 1% Triton, and the rate of re-endothelialization with tritium-labeled endothelial cells was determined. The rate was 11-13 times that of the same cells on untreated substrate. These data confirm that biomolecules increase the attachment rate of endothelial cells to synthetic substrate, and also suggest that endothelial cells may secrete a Triton-insoluble product (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) into subendothelial matrix that increases re-endothelialization.\r"

After graft removal, the WBC count on grafts (gWBC) was determined by light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). One hr after graft implantation, pWBC decreased significantly in Groups I-IV to 46%, 52%, 40%, and 45% of preoperative pWBC, respectively. There was no significant difference among the groups. LM revealed gWBC per 63x field of 8.0, 12.3, 5.8, and 6.8 in Groups I-IV, respectively. Similarly, SEM showed gWBC per 2000x field of 2.5, 5.6, 0.7, and 1.5 in Groups I-IV, respectively. SEM gWBC was significantly greater in Group II than I (p less than 0.01), and significantly less in Group III than I (p less than 0.05). Results suggested that complement and arachidonic acid pathways alone do not affect the fall in pWBC, but may influence gWBC.\r"

Ten non-heparinized dogs (18-25 kg) were catheterized in both femoral arteries with 10 cm of CPC and HBPC (5 Fr., Cordis) 24 hr after injection of 300-420 microCi of In-PLT, and imaged for 3 hr with the computerized gamma camera. The regional platelet deposition curves (RPDC) indicated multiple peaks and valleys; the curves were analyzed for early rate of thrombus formation (upswing), thrombus retention time (full width at half maxima of the RPDC-peak), and rate of embolization (downswing) on both catheters. The four parameters (mean +/- SD) of thrombosis on catheters and integral of the radioactivity time curve for the 3 hr duration of imaging were calculated from normalized counts/sec. The rate of thrombus formation and rate of embolization are higher for the control than HBPC, suggesting that heparin-bonding decreases the early rate of thrombosis and embolization. The thrombus adhesivity and retention time appear shorter for the control catheter, indicating that the control thrombogenic catheter forms multiple thrombi and emboli than HBPC. The integral appears larger for the control catheter than HBPC. In vivo (dynamic) studies, in vitro studies, and critical analyses of the radioactivity time curve were essential for complete evaluation of thrombogenicity of catheters and other cardiovascular prostheses.\r"

The overall incidence of vascular access clotting decreased from a monthly rate of 0.06 to 0.03 events per patient-month over the 5 year period. Distribution of the number of events per patient did not differ between the two periods, with 55% to 60% of patients having no clotting episode. Patients with recurrent clotting (two or more events) accounted for 68% of episodes. During the second period, there were no differences in the incidence of vascular access clotting in epoetin treated patients vs untreated patients (0.38 events per patient-year vs. 0.46 events per patient-year, both slightly lower than in period 1 [0.52 events per patient-year]). It is concluded that epoetin does not increase vascular access clotting.\r"

A vascular access graft that controls the shunted flow at 500-650 ml/min by venturi flow resistance, and offers the potential for reduced venous stenosis, is presented. Twelve venturi grafts consisting of 6 mm ePTFE, with a thermally formed venturi resistance, were implanted in a canine femoral arterio-venous (A-V) model and cannulated for simulated dialysis for periods up to 6 months. Pressures, bleeding times, and puncture site healing were compared at sites upstream and downstream of the venturi. Nine 6 mm ePTFE grafts were implanted as controls. Venturi and control graft patency rates were similar: 90% for venturi grafts and 89% for control implants at 4 months. Measurements verified pressure dissipation by the venturi from 85 to 15 mmHg, delivering near-normal pressures to the vein; downstream pressures were 22 mmHg higher in controls. Sites downstream of the venturi did not bleed at 4 min, whereas bleeding was often noted after 9 min at other sites. Puncture sites upstream of the venturi had less stenosis and less mural thrombus than sites downstream of the venturi, and compared favorably with puncture sites in the control grafts. This improved healing and low pressure delivery to the vein may offer clinical advantages.\r"

This article presents an in vitro model of endothelialization at the anastomotic site, which can provide cellular level information on morphologic reconstruction, and its substrate dependency. Test materials included polyethylene terephthalate (PET), segmented polyurethanes (SPUs), and glass with or without protein precoating (collagen, fibronectin, and albumin). In vitro endothelialization on these substrates was quantitatively determined by phase contrast microscopy. The results obtained show: 1) The fastest endothelialization rate was found on PET, followed by relatively hydrophobic SPU, and glass--the slowest was on hydrophilic SPU; and 2) Precoating with proteins drastically altered the cellular behaviors; collagen greatly enhanced endothelialization in vitro, followed by fibronectin. Precoating by albumin, however, greatly retarded endothelialization. The present study strongly suggests that unidirectional endothelialization at the anastomotic sites is controlled by the surface characteristics of graft materials.\r"

In vitro, mature monolayers of canine homologous venous endothelial cells (CHVENC) were exposed to heparinized whole blood samples taken at days one and four postoperatively, followed by weekly tests. PMNs adherent to the CHVENC were counted per culture area. Results showed the feasibility of PMN monitoring, and demonstrated a late PMN adhesion, reaching its maximum about 20 days after implantation and decreasing to normal values after five weeks.

These grafts were prepared using dialdehyde starch (DS), and a polyepoxy polyether compound (PC), as crosslinking agents. Internal compliance was measured using the Dynatek DCT1 Dynamic Compliance Tester, developed by Dynatek Laboratories. This device utilizes a variable speed DC motor coupled to miniature bellows, which displace a stroke volume controllable to within 0.5 microliter. The bellows displace fluid into and out of the graft, resulting in a sinusoidal change in internal pressure. Volumetric displacement is monitored by a linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) mounted on the motor coupling, whereas internal graft pressure is monitored by a miniature pressure transducer mounted on the closed end of the graft. For this series of experiments, a pressure range of 80-120 mmHg was used, with a cycle speed of 80 cycles/min. Preliminary results indicate that PC fixation of bovine artery results in a vascular graft with internal compliance somewhere between fresh tissue and DS fixation. This data confirms qualitative assessment. The DCT1 provides valuable comparative information on the dynamic internal compliance of vascular prostheses. These measurements reflect what occurs in the graft lumen, since they take into account wall compression and axial deformation. Further development is required to separate radial and longitudinal compliance components.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 patients undergoing hemodialysis were incubated for 7 days on Cuprophan, Hemophan, and polyacrylonitrile flat sheet membranes. IgG, IgA, IgM, and IL-6 were assayed in the supernatants with the aid of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. Pokeweed mitogen-stimulated IgG production declined significantly from 319 +/- 40 ng/ml on polystyrole to 162 +/- 26 ng/ml on Cuprophan; 135 +/- 25 ng/ml on Hemophan; and 109 +/- 20 ng/ml on polyacrylonitrile. A similar pattern was observed for IgA and IgM production. IL-6 production was significantly reduced in the presence of Cuprophan (151 +/- 45 pg/ml), Hemophan (167 +/- 6 pg/ml), and polyacrylonitrile (108 +/- 33 pg/ml) when compared with polystyrole (724 +/- 34 pg/ml). It was concluded that the long-term exposure of mononuclear cells to artificial surfaces during dialysis may contribute to the impaired humoral response observed in dialysis patients. This effect may be due to a decline in B cell stimulation by monocytes, a possibility suggested by the reduction in monocytic IL-6 production.\r"

Of 63 pregnant women with a current or past history of autoimmune thyroid disorder, 11 (one with active and six with a past history of Graves' disease and four with autoimmune thyroiditis) gave birth to a baby with transient hyper or hypo-thyroidism. Only high maternal titres (which could persist after partial thyroidectomy) of anti TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) led to neonatal hyperthyroidism. Both types of assay were able to detect the antibodies responsible for transitory neonatal autoimmune thyroid disease. TBII values reflected TSAb titres so that there was a significant correlation between the results of both assays in women with Graves' disease and in neonatal sera. Positive TBII and TBkAb activities were present in 5 of the 28 women with autoimmune thyroiditis. Therefore, when TBII is positive, the functional characterization of the antibodies warrants the use of the bioassay.\r"

DESIGN--A prospective case-control study with data collected by patient interview and examination of all available records during a 16-months period between 1984 and 1986. SETTING--A large maternity hospital in Kuwait where diabetes in pregnancy is common. SUBJECTS--The cases were a consecutive sample of 731 women, delivered during the study period, recorded in the labour ward register as being diabetic or having abnormal glucose tolerance, the control group was formed from the next woman in the register (provided she was not known to be diabetic). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Type of diabetes followed the WHO classification, with subdivision depending on level of fasting plasma glucose. Type of perinatal death was examined in detail and birthweight centile calculated. RESULTS--Of the 731 cases, 22% were established diabetics, most were treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs before pregnancy and insulin during pregnancy. Of those discovered during pregnancy, 43% were classified as gestational diabetes and the remainder as impaired glucose tolerance. Overall, 50% of cases were treated with insulin. Established diabetics had a perinatal mortality rate nearly four times greater than non diabetics (RR, 3.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 6.4) and for gestational diabetics RR was 2.0 95% CI 1.2 to 3.7). Unexplained deaths were particularly common, both in established diabetics (RR, 18.4, 95% CI 3.9 to 85.7) and in gestational diabetics (RR, 13.4, 95% (CI 2.9 to 61.6). Cases with impaired glucose tolerance had no stillbirths and had a lower perinatal loss than the controls, though this was not statistically significant. Heavier babies were seen in all case groups compared with controls, though the impaired glucose tolerance group had lower birthweights than the other two case groups. CONCLUSIONS--Type 2 diabetes was found to be common, most cases being diagnosed in pregnancy. Under the conditions found in Kuwait, diabetes, in the sense of a raised fasting glucose, is accompanied by a high rate of perinatal loss from unexplained stillbirth. This applies whether the condition was present before pregnancy or was discovered during pregnancy. Fetal macrosomia was also common in both situations. Impaired glucose tolerance, where fasting levels remain normal, does not appear to increase fetal loss, but may be associated with fetal macrosomia. As these women age they are likely to develop overt diabetes in the non-pregnant state, and subsequently to develop serious complications of this disease.

While similar pD2 values for noradrenaline (NA) were found, the Emax values ranked cervix greater than or equal to isthmus greater than or equal to fundus (cervix greater than fundus). The pD2 values for arginine-vasopressin (AVP) showed minor differences, while the Emax values for this peptide ranked fundus greater than or equal to isthmus greater than or equal to cervix (fundus greater than cervix). Arteries from the fundus and isthmus displayed weak, inconsistent contractile responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha, but more pronounced contractions were induced by this prostanoid in arterial preparations from the distal cervix.

Embryonic cardiac activity could be detected as early as 25 days after follicle aspiration. The range in appearance of embryonic cardiac activity in normal continuing pregnancies was 5 days. There was no correlation with maternal age, day of embryo transfer, or cell stage at embryo transfer. As the difference in appearance of embryonic cardiac activity was associated with a difference in crown-rump length whilst the subsequent growth curve was normal we ascribe these findings to different duration of the implantation stage. The later cardiac activity was detected the greater the risk of miscarriage. Reference curves were created relating embryonic heart rate to the number of days after follicle aspiration, the number of days that cardiac activity is present and the crown-rump length. In pregnancies ending in miscarriage heart rate patterns fell away from the reference curve. Embryonic factors seem to play an essential role in these observations.\r"

All patients received local anaesthesia. The women in the LLETZ group experienced less post operative haemorrhage, less discomfort, operative time was greatly reduced, and histological material was available for confirmation of the diagnosis. There was no significant difference in recurrence of CIN after treatment between the two groups. At 6 month follow-up, recurrence rates of 8.2% (CIN II) and 7.5% (CIN III) were observed in the laser-group and 5% (CIN II) and 5.3% (CIN III) in the LLETZ group. Further advantages of LLETZ are reduced capital expenditure and no hazard to the eyesight of the surgeon, but laser treatment is preferable in patients with widespread vaginal involvement.\r"

DESIGN--Prevalence study with extensive examination and testing and with recall of childhood conditions. SETTING--Population based study in Kuopio, Finland. SUBJECTS--Representative sample of 2679 men aged 42, 48, 54, and 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Ischaemic findings on progressive maximal exercise test. RESULTS--Low socioeconomic style in childhood was associated with significantly higher prevalence of findings indicating ischaemias. Compared with those in the highest tertile of childhood socioeconomic conditions, the age adjusted odds ratio for subjects in the lowest tertile was 1.44 and for those in the middle tertile 1.35. Adjustment for years of cigarette smoking times the average number of cigarettes smoked, ratio of high density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibrinogen and serum selenium concentrations, and adult height did not appreciably weaken the association. Adjustment for adult socioeconomic state resulted in a 16% decline in the association. The association was reduced to non-significance by adjustment for measures of prevalent cardiovascular illness. CONCLUSIONS--Socioeconomic state in childhood was significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease in middle aged men. Levels of risk factors measured at middle age did not account for this association, nor did adult height. Because childhood socioeconomic conditions precede the development of ischaemic heart disease the substantial impact of prevalent illness on the observed association suggests that ischaemic heart disease develops earlier in those with lower socioeconomic state during childhood.\r"

SETTING--24 Food distribution sites in Arero and Borana provinces in southern Ethiopia. PATIENTS--A monthly average of 14,173 and 5,334 children under 5 were examined in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Altogether 148,966 child months (105,872 for 1985 and 43,094 for 1986) were available for analysis. INTERVENTION--The families of all children were supplied with food each month. Basic medical care was also provided. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality in children under 5. RESULTS--A 40% increase in crude mortality was observed among children living in traditional and stable societies. The severe consequences were observed mainly among children living in relief shelters, where a threefold to fourfold increase in crude mortality was recorded among children. Increased childhood mortality was also associated with high prevalence of malnutrition, living in the most arid areas, and the dry season. A long period of food aid was needed to normalise the nutritional state, especially for children living in relief shelters. CONCLUSIONS--The most severe consequences of the widespread famine that occurred in the Arero and Borana provinces of southern Ethiopia during 1985-6 were seen among children living in relief shelters. Early food intervention may decrease the scale of migration and thus also reduce the severe consequences of a famine.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective observational study with prospectively gathered data on all patients admitted to the unit between June 1985 and July 1987 and followed up until 1 January 1989. SETTING--Regional intensive therapy unit. PATIENTS--513 critically ill adult patients, 16 of whom were excluded because measurements on severity of illness scoring were not available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, severity of illness (determined with the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score), and diagnostic category on admission; deaths in the unit; and long term survival after discharge. Details of the survivors were sent to the Registrar General for Scotland, who issued copies of death certificates for the patients who had died between discharge and 1 January 1989. RESULTS--Of 497 patients, 119 (24%) died in the intensive therapy unit and 120 (24%) after discharge, leaving 258 (52%) who were still alive at two years. The median (APACHE II) score was 13 and about half of the patients were aged 55 years or more. A wide range of critical illnesses, except neurosurgical emergencies, were treated. Survival analysis showed that only 41 (34%) of 122 patients with an APACHE II score of greater than or equal to 20 were alive at one year (95% confidence interval 25 to 42) compared with 124 (80%) of 155 patients with a score of less than 10 (73 to 87). Of the 144 patients aged 65 or more, only 68 (47%) survived to one year (39 to 55) but 90 (83%) of the 109 patients aged between 18 and 34 survived a similar period (76 to 71). Mortality was also related to diagnostic category; 71% of trauma victims survived to one year compared with only 41% of those admitted with gastrointestinal pathology. Univariate analysis of the results showed that age, severity of illness, and diagnosis were all predictors of long term survival. Multivariate analysis, however, showed that only age and severity of illness were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS--Long term survival of patients treated in an intensive therapy unit is related to severity of illness and to age. The outcome from critical illness in the elderly population is poor.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of inpatient Korner data for January 1988 to April 1989. SETTING--Three districts in North East Thames region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of readmissions after index discharge for all acute specialties combined and by specialty (general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, trauma and orthopaedics, and geriatrics); readmission rates at 28 days after index discharge; and rates standardised for age group and sex by specialty and by consultant. RESULTS--All specialties showed an early peak in number of admissions, which levelled off by 28 days. Readmission rates at 28 days were appreciably lower in surgical specialties than in medical specialties (for example, general surgery 4.1% v geriatric medicine 15.1%). They were related to age and sex of the patient. Rates standardised for these variables did not significantly differ by district. Likewise, significant differences in standardised rates were not obtained for consultants within a specialty in one district. CONCLUSIONS--Readmission rates may be measured with Korner data. The pattern of readmissions with time means that readmission rates should be measured at not more than 28 days after the index discharge; the rates require standardisation for age and sex. Annual comparisons of standardised rates may be made among districts for combinations of specialties; those among individual consultants or specialties are unlikely to be statistically valid.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of a stratified random sample of case notes of patients with an unplanned readmission between July 1987 and June 1988 by nine clinical assessors (263 assessments) and categorisation of the readmission as avoidable, unavoidable, or unclassifiable. SETTING--District in North East Thames region. 481 General medical, geriatric, and general surgical inpatients with a readmission at 0-6 days or 21-27 days after the first (index) discharge between July 1987 and June 1988 from whom 100 case notes were selected randomly and of which 74 were available for study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Assessment of readmissions as avoidable, unavoidable, unclassifiable, variability of assessment within cases and variability among assessors according to specialty and duration to readmission. RESULTS--General medical and geriatric readmissions and surgical readmissions at 0-6 days after discharge were more likely to be assessed as avoidable than those at 21-27 days (medical readmissions 32 v 6%, surgical admissions 49 v 19%). General surgical readmissions were significantly more frequently assessed as avoidable than general medical and geriatric readmissions. The extent of agreement between doctors varied, with general medical and geriatric readmissions at 21-27 days after first discharge causing the greatest variability of judgment. CONCLUSIONS--Differences were apparent in the extent of avoidability of readmissions in different groups of admissions. However, assessors rated only 49.3% of the group with the highest proportion of avoidable admissions (surgical readmissions at 0-6 days) as avoidable. The remainder were thought to be unavoidable except for 2%, which could not be classified. The use of readmission rates as an outcome indicator of hospital inpatient care should be avoided.\r"

Results are presented showing anatomical detail of the internal organs of the fetus. Some pathology is also demonstrated. These results were obtained using the modulus blipped echo-planar single-pulse technique (MBEST). Running at 10 frames/second, the modulus version of the fast low-angle excitation echo-planar technique (FLEET) is used to produce ungated fetal cardiac movies.\r"

Three patients were scanned before diagnosis; one of these also had two follow-up scans. A further six patients were scanned a variable time after diagnosis and treatment. On each scan, a periaortic soft-tissue mass was readily identified, the distribution corresponding to that seen on computed tomography. There was no difference in the mean T1 relaxation time of the mass between patients scanned before diagnosis and those scanned after treatment. However, the patient followed with serial scans showed a progressive reduction in the T1 value of the mass with time. Comparison with results obtained in patients with lymphoma suggests that the T1 values in retroperitoneal fibrosis are lower than in lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe's criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page's criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns, N1, P1, P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern, using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation.\r"

It was possible to quantitate iodine levels, in terms of mass thickness, in both the renal parenchyma and collecting system in 38 of 40 kidneys studied (20 patients). In the two kidneys on which measurements could not be made, the cause of failure was subtraction artefact due to movement of bowel gas, compounded in one case by poor renal opacification. The variations of iodine mass thickness against time were plotted and their forms were similar to dynamic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies of transplanted kidneys. Potential clinical applications of this method, in particular the functional assessment of the dilated upper urinary tract, are suggested based on its ability to offer quantitative information in addition to anatomical images.\r"

  ".U": "91070190\r", 
  ".W": "Much clinical and experimental evidence suggests that pancreatic ischaemia in the early phase of acute pancreatitis is important in the development of pancreatic necrosis. While depletion of intravascular volume has often been assumed to be the main circulatory defect, an additional disturbance of pancreatic microcirculation has been demonstrated experimentally. Possible contributory mechanisms include chemical-induced vasoconstriction, direct injury of vessel wall, intravascular coagulation and increased endothelial permeability resulting in pancreatic oedema, haemoconcentration and impaired venous drainage. Pancreatic ischaemia as a consequence of these local effects seems to be responsible for the transition of mild pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis. In experimental models the beneficial effect of various drugs and of sympathetic blockade has been ascribed to an improvement in pancreatic perfusion. Although effective volume therapy is generally accepted as the mainstay of conservative treatment in acute pancreatitis, the efficacy of different fluid preparations is still controversial, and simple fluid resuscitation has not been shown to prevent the development of parenchymal necrosis. The specific impairment of pancreatic microcirculation cannot be prevented merely by replenishment of intravascular volume with crystalloids, albumin or plasma despite normalization of macrohaemodynamics. In contrast, partial replacement of blood by dextran preparations has been shown to increase pancreatic perfusion by improving blood fluidity. Isovolaemic haemodilution in conjunction with conventional fluid therapy may provide a new and effective means of protecting the pancreas from secondary injury due to the early ischaemic phase of acute pancreatitis.\r"

The remaining 24 lesions included three breast cancers and one lymph node with Hodgkin's disease. In this group cytology was inadequate for diagnosis in 54 per cent, including one breast cancer. No lesion with benign cytology was subsequently shown to be malignant. The study supports the view that clinical diagnosis and cytology are accurate in the diagnosis of benign breast disease of this type. Breast cancer may rarely present with the clinical features of a fibroadenoma and too few lesions have been studied to assess fully the performance of cytological biopsy in detecting these small mobile lesions. A non-excisional policy should therefore include prolonged follow-up and repeat biopsy.\r"

We therefore studied the energy metabolism of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN), focusing on energy charge and function, especially superoxide anion (O2-) generation, in relation to the hepatic mitochondrial redox state. By labelling the PMN adenine nucleotide pool with radioactive adenine and by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, the energy charge and O2- production was measured in 18 patients with hepatoma (non-cirrhotic, seven; cirrhotic, 11) undergoing hepatectomy. Their arterial ketone body ratios (KBRs), reflecting the hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were above 0.7 before operation. After surgery, the 18 patients were divided into two groups: group A, KBR greater than 0.7, n = 10; and group B, KBR less than 0.7, n = 8. The energy charge and O2- release in group B decreased significantly from preoperative values (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01 respectively) and when compared with group A (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively). These results suggest that impaired hepatic energy metabolism (KBR less than 0.7) in hepatectomized patients leads to impaired energy charge and O2- production in the PMNs.\r"

Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between lymphocyte function and the period of jaundice (correlation coefficient -0.57, P less than 0.001). Following BDL for 21 days, groups of animals had internal biliary drainage for 7, 14 and 28 days, and external drainage for 14 days. Compared with obstructed animals, 14 days internal drainage was required to improve lymphocyte function (P less than 0.05). Animals which had 14 days of external drainage had significantly lower lymphocyte stimulation than internal drainage animals (P less than 0.05). The results demonstrate that obstructive jaundice produces a progressive reduction of T lymphocyte function. This can be reversed by biliary drainage, internal drainage being more effective than external drainage.\r"

In a sequential study, 31 patients with a liver transplant were investigated by 99mTc-IODIDA (IODIDA) scanning and T tube cholangiography (TTC) and the results were compared with clinical outcome. Seven patients had an extrahepatic biliary obstruction and one patient had a biliary leak. In the detection of biliary complications TTC and IODIDA scanning were similar in terms of sensitivity (63 per cent for both) but TTC had a better specificity (79 per cent versus 60 per cent) and accuracy (74 per cent versus 60 per cent) than IODIDA scanning. When liver function was taken into account, the diagnostic efficacy of both tests in patients with bilirubin levels of less than 200 mumol/l was similar. With levels greater than 200 mumol/l there was a greater number of false positive results with IODIDA scanning (12 per cent versus 54 per cent). The only significant biliary leak was clearly detected by TTC but not IODIDA scanning. TTC remains the more effective way of evaluating the biliary tract after transplantation. IODIDA scanning has limited value when bilirubin levels are elevated, but may provide additional information about blood supply, hepatocyte function and intrahepatic cholestasis.\r"

The use of vasoactive agents to redistribute arterial blood flow towards tumour, and of biodegradable microspheres to slow tumour blood flow, have also been suggested as methods of further improving tumour exposure to drug. We present 21 patients who received intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases. Combined treatment (angiotensin II, albumin microspheres and 5-fluorouracil) was administered 4-6 weekly, and bolus 5-fluorouracil was given in the intervening weeks. Toxicity was minimal. Responses were seen in seven patients. Fewer than half of the deaths were from liver metastases; a quarter of the patients died from non-cancer-related causes. Survival was prolonged in the treated group compared with historical controls. These results suggest that this regimen has activity in patients with colorectal liver metastases.\r"

  ".W": "From 1960 to 1987, 1209 patients with colorectal liver metastases were recorded, and followed until 1 January 1990. In 242 cases the diagnosis was based on external imaging, whereas 967 patients had operative confirmation and staging of their liver disease. Three groups of patients were analysed: group 1 involved 921 cases, of whom 902 were deemed non-resectable whereas 19 could not be unequivocally classified. Only 21 patients lived for longer than 3 years, seven survived for 4 years, but there were no 5-year survivors. Group 2 comprised 62 highly selected patients who at laparotomy demonstrated resectable metastatic spread confined to the liver, but this was not treated mainly because of a formerly different therapeutic approach. These patients had a significantly longer median survival time (14.2 versus 6.9 months), but also failed to achieve 5-year survival. The 226 patients forming group 3 underwent hepatic resection with intent to cure. Nine of them had minimal macroscopic disease left, and 34 with all gross tumour removed had positive margins. Survival of patients with these 43 eventually non-radical resections followed an identical course as in group 2 (median survival 13.3 months, maximum 42 months). Of the 183 patients with potentially curative resection ten died after surgery (5.5 per cent). Actuarial 5 and 10-year survival rates in the remaining 173 patients were 40 and 27 per cent with 25 and seven patients alive at respective periods of time. Until 1 January 1990, 64 patients remained free from recurrent disease for up to 24 years. In three patients the tumour status at death was unclear. The other 106 patients developed definite cancer relapse. Nevertheless they demonstrated a prolongation of survival time by a median of 1 year when compared with the 43 non-radically resected patients or the 62 untreated patients with resectable liver-only metastases, and accomplished a maximum survival time of 8 years. Radical excision of colorectal secondaries to the liver therefore offers effective palliation, and in a small number the chance of a cure.\r"

The major postoperative complications were: haemorrhage in five cases, major bile duct injury in three, subphrenic abscess in two, liver failure in one and wound dehiscence in one. The 30-day (operative) mortality rate was 12 per cent and the median survival duration, including operative mortality, was 9.7 (range 0.2-32.1) months. The survival rate was 46 per cent at 1 year, 33 per cent at 2 years and 22 per cent at 3 years. The morbidity, mortality and survival data of extended hepatectomy were comparable with the results of lesser hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma. We conclude that extended hepatectomy is a worthwhile operation for large hepatocellular carcinomas and a viable alternative to liver transplantation.\r"

Chemiluminescence (a phenomenon based on the emission of light during chemical reactions and which is dependent on oxygen free radical activity) was used as an index of oxygen free radical activity and was measured in tissue samples at 5-min intervals following induction of pancreatitis. The control mean(s.e.m.) serum amylase level 1 h after induction of pancreatitis was 635(13) units. It was significantly elevated in caerulein-induced pancreatitis, 1833(118) units (P less than 0.05) and exceeded 3000 units in all taurocholate-infused animals. Mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence ranged from 44 (8) mV 100 mg-1 at time zero to 404(113) mV 100 mg-1 at 1 h in controls. In caerulein-induced pancreatitis mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence peaked at 20 min (1399(239) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.02) and in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis at 15 min (2316(95) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.004). Superoxide dismutase significantly reduced chemiluminescence and hyperamylasaemia in taurocholate groups. Increasing oxygen free radical activity paralleled evolving pancreatitis. Superoxide dismutase may have a therapeutic role in pancreatitis.\r"

Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy.\r"

All patients had symptomatic gallstones, functioning gallbladders and comparable stone profiles. Lithotripsy was administered using a piezoelectric lithotripter. Dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile acid and terpene. Clearance was assessed at 6 months using ultrasound and oral cholecystography. Patients with less than 50 per cent stone clearance at the end of 6 months were considered failures. The number of patients with total or partial clearance in the combined group (7/10) was significantly greater than those in the lithotripsy alone group (0/10, P less than 0.002).

Of these 23 patients, five were lithotripsy failures, five developed acute pancreatitis, one had acute cholecystitis, and one had cholangitis. One patient had her gallbladder removed incidentally at the time of surgery for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Ten patients underwent surgery for recurrent biliary pain, probably related to fragment passage via the cystic duct. We suggest that up to 16 of these 23 patients did not necessarily require cholecystectomy, i.e. five patients with pancreatitis, one patient with cholangitis and ten patients with recurrent biliary colic. Conservative and/or endoscopic management may be successful in the first instance to allow further treatment with lithotripsy in the majority of patients. If, however, the expertise to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy is not available or the patient declines further lithotripsy, then resort to surgery may be necessary. We propose that it is the responsibility of the management team in charge of the lithotripsy unit to inform both the patient and the referring clinicians of the possible side-effects and outcome of treatment in an attempt to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures.\r"

  ".U": "91070213\r", 
  ".W": "Two interrelated studies were carried out to determine whether extent of sialomucin change adjacent to a primary colorectal carcinoma predicted local tumour invasiveness and risk of local recurrence. In the first, depth of tumour penetration was correlated with the length of the sialomucin band adjacent to 72 primary colorectal cancers. There was a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in sialomucin band length adjacent to tumours invading adjacent structures compared with those which had not (Mann-Whitney U test), although there was no overall correlation between depth of penetration, Duke's classification or degree of differentiation (Kruskal-Wallis test). A sialomucin band of greater than 3 cm was associated with a 70 per cent probability of adjacent structure (T4) invasion. These observations were then tested prospectively in a second study involving 256 patients to determine whether the presence of a greater than 3 cm sialomucin band could predict local recurrence. Presence of a greater than 3 cm sialomucin band was a significant (x2 = 7.12, d.f. = 1, P less than 0.001) and independent predictor of local but not distant recurrence. In addition both the interval to local recurrence and survival were significantly shorter if a greater than 3 cm sialomucin band was present. However the accuracy of greater than 3 cm sialomucin band as a predictive test for local recurrence was only 70 per cent. The extent of sialomucin adjacent to a primary colorectal cancer does provide a crude assessment of tumour invasiveness and risk of local recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Collagenase has been implicated in colonic anastomotic dehiscence but the enzyme has not previously been specifically measured in colonic healing. A 72 h tissue culture method for colonic tissue and a radiochemical assay for collagenase were adapted to measure the enzyme in healing rabbit colon, with specificity of the assay confirmed by sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Normal and postoperative colon secreted collagenase, predominantly in a latent form, in the first 24 h of culture. Total activity reached a plateau after 48 and 72 h in culture, when 50-70 per cent of the enzyme was in an active form. At these times in culture, activity was significantly higher than after 24 h (P less than 0.001). One day after anastomosis the total amount of collagenase secreted in culture was higher than normal but the increase did not achieve significance. Three days after anastomosis the colon secreted more collagenase than explants from 1 day postoperative tissue (P less than 0.002). The proportion of active enzyme in the first 24 h in culture was also increased. Since active collagenase can be measured in culture medium from both normal and postoperative colon, the tissue may be secreting plasminogen activator which allows plasmin to activate the enzyme. The increase in collagenase after operation coincided with a decrease in collagen concentration in the colon wall, measured by hydroxyproline. This supports previous suggestions that collagenase contributes to anastomotic dehiscence. However, the findings must be interpreted with caution as the variance of the results was shown to be predominantly due to time in culture, suggesting this could be a bigger influence than the operation itself. In addition, our previously reported immunohistochemical study of this system indicated that collagenase only occurred in a localized region, restricted to the everted portion of the anastomosis, with the activity being tightly controlled by its inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases.\r"

Patients had a colonic ileus lasting 3-10 days and during this proximal and distal inactivity the intraluminal pressure remained within 6 mmHg of atmospheric pressure. After recovery of activity, pressures proximal to the anastomosis in excess of 10 mmHg occurred during less than 1 per cent of the recording time. Distal peak pressures were significantly elevated with respect to the proximal site (P less than 0.001). Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg. Four patients had distal repetitive tonic contractions creating a pressure difference across the anastomosis with a mean of 20 mmHg and a peak of 45 mmHg. Each contraction persisted for 15-20 min. Intraluminal pressures are unlikely to play a role in anastomotic dehiscence.\r"

Seventeen patients with potentially infected arterial grafts were imaged in addition to routine investigations but were managed according to our normal surgical practice. 99mTc-imaging was positive in eight patients with proven graft infection and falsely positive in one patient with a groin haematoma (89 per cent specificity). There were no false negatives (100 per cent sensitivity) after an average follow-up of 6 months (range 3-9 months). This technique has proved a reliable and rapid method of confirming graft infection.\r"

The reactions of the subpapillary venous plexus in patients with Buerger's disease were observed by analysing the fractional blood volume of tissue using a visible light reflective spectrophotometer. Capillary morphology was investigated using an intravital video-microscopic system. Twenty-seven subjects, comprising 13 normals and 14 patients with Buerger's disease, were studied. In the nailbeds of patients with Buerger's disease, an increase in the number of loops, cyanotic colour change and dilatation were observed. In this condition there was incompetence of venular tonus and regurgitation at venular valves. Buerger's colour is probably due to excessive congestion of venous blood in the subpapillary venous plexus which is produced by these mechanisms.\r"

While larger adenomas are reliably localized the results are less certain for small tumours. This study explores the relationship between cellular DNA profile and thallium uptake (localization accuracy) in 24 parathyroid adenomas. The DNA profile was assessed using flow cytometry and standard subtraction thallium scintigraphy was performed before surgery. Fifteen of the 24 adenomas demonstrated excessive mitotic activity and 13 of these glands were accurately localized. Of the remaining nine glands, only five were localized accurately (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test including Yates' correction). This difference in thallium uptake could not be accounted for on the basis of gland weight. Thallium localization of parathyroid adenomas is related to mitotic activity. This may explain some of the limitations of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa. Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography. The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach. There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01). The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005). Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients. These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage.\r"

A total of 5111 difficulties were reported; the number reported by each subject varied from 0 to 13 (mean 2.6 [standard deviation 2.09]) per problem. The problems that generated the most difficulties were depression, confusion in the elderly, chronic back pain, loss of autonomy in the elderly and sexually transmitted disease. The most frequent difficulties were with the patient's noncompliance with treatment, clinical diagnosis, failure of a specific treatment, inadequate health care resources and the physician's own emotional reactions. The difficulties for each problem were the same in the two groups 70% of the time. Physician's perceptions of their difficulties can be useful in the planning of initial training and continuing medical education.\r"

  ".W": "Prenatal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) restricted to women with defined risk factors for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection fails to identify many carriers. A centralized program of routine HBsAg screening for all pregnant women in Alberta was introduced in 1985. We collected and analysed data for the first 2 years of the program in Edmonton to determine the frequency of risk factors for HBsAg positivity, the proportion of multiparous HBsAg-positive women not identified in previous pregnancies, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of providing immunoprophylaxis to infants at risk of HBV infection and the degree of success in inducing adequate protection. A total of 149 women (158 pregnancies) were found to be HBsAg positive. Risk factors were readily ascertainable for 85% of the women; the remaining 15% would not have been identified through risk-selective screening. The most common risk factors were Oriental ethnic origin, history of hepatitis, jaundice or multiple transfusions of blood or blood products, and occupational exposure to blood. Although 86% of the multiparous HBsAg-positive women had risk factors, only 7% had been identified in previous pregnancies. The Alberta program appears to be cost-effective. We conclude that only routine prenatal screening will identify all infants at risk of perinatal HBV infection and that a comprehensive public health program involving central laboratories, private physicians and public health staff can be highly effective and efficient in protecting infants against hepatitis B.\r"

We reviewed the charts of 36 children with severe HUS who were treated at the Izaac Walton Killam Hospital for Children, Halifax, over 10 years to assess the effectiveness of plasma therapy. All children who required specific supportive therapy for renal dysfunction, hemolysis or serious extrarenal complications were included. We compared the outcome of 18 children who received plasma therapy from 1982 to 1987 with that of 18 children who did not. The two groups were similar with regard to the severity of HUS, the length of hospital stay, the duration of renal dysfunction and the incidence of disease-related complications, such as seizures, enterocolitis and cardiomyopathy. At discharge the prevalence of hypertension was higher in the plasma therapy group than in the control group. Plasma therapy did not demonstrate any benefit that would outweigh the risk of fluid overload, hyperproteinemia and transmission of viral infection.\r"

In addition, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured. In the first part of the study, epidural catheters were inserted in 14 patients before herniotomy. Mepivacaine, 1.5 per cent (0.35 ml.kg-1), was administered and norepinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) was added in seven patients. The duration of anaesthesia was prolonged from 54 +/- 11 min to 83 +/- 12 min (P less than 0.05) and CSF NE concentrations increased from 68 +/- 12 pg.ml-1 to 336 +/- 85 pg.ml-1 in the NE group (P less than 0.01). In the second part, eight patients with herpetic neuralgia received epidural analgesia at the fourth to eighth thoracic interspace, using bupivacaine 0.25 per cent, with and without NE. The CSF NE concentrations in this group were greater than in the surgical patients before operation and increased from 254 +/- 58 to 406 +/- 58 pg.ml-1 30 min after administration of bupivacaine with NE. The duration of pain relief was prolonged with NE. These results suggest that adding NE to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia. Moreover, NE concentrations in surgical patients increased to levels similar to those found in patients suffering from herpetic analgesia. This suggests that the increase of CSF NE in chronic pain states has an antinociceptive effect.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular response of a continuous alfentanil infusion during abdominal aortic surgery (AAS). Each subject (n = 20) received a beta-blocking drug preoperatively, and was premedicated with oral lorazepam. Anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 and thiopentone 3 mg.kg-1, and was maintained with a variable rate infusion of alfentanil and 66 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen. During the infusion, boluses of alfentanil, 7.5 micrograms.kg-1, were administered to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within 20 per cent of awake baseline values. Haemodynamic stability during surgery was achieved with infusion rates varying between 0.5 and 2.5 micrograms.kg-1, which resulted in mean alfentanil serum concentrations ranging from 186 +/- 53 to 315 +/- 98 ng.ml-1. The mean cumulative alfentanil dose was 15.4 +/- 6.2 mg.patient-1 for surgery which lasted an average of 141 +/- 41 min. Throughout surgery, no patient required inhalational anaesthetic agents or vasoactive drugs. Fifteen of the 20 patients had perioperative Holter monitoring. No myocardial ischaemia was detected during the intraoperative period. However, there was a 33 per cent incidence of myocardial ischaemia on the first postoperative day. There were no myocardial infarcts and no deaths. We conclude that in beta-blocked patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery, a variable rate alfentanil infusion administered with 66 per cent nitrous oxide provides anaesthesia characterized by good haemodynamic control without the need for supplemental agents or vasoactive drugs.\r"

The study was randomized and double-blinded and 91 of the 105 children also received droperidol, 25 micrograms.kg-1 IV, after induction of anaesthesia with halothane and N2O in oxygen. Both doses of OTFC produced significantly greater sedation (first present at 20 min) and anxiolysis (first present in Group I at 40 min) than the placebo. Recovery times were similar in the three groups and analgesic requirements in the recovery room were significantly lower in Group I than Group III. Both OTFC groups took longer to tolerate oral fluids in the postoperative discharge unit than the placebo group and this caused patients in Group I to have a delayed discharge from the hospital compared to Group III. Preoperative pruritus occurred significantly more frequently in Groups I and II (58 and 76 per cent, respectively) than Group III (23 per cent). Although the incidences of nausea and vomiting tended to be slightly higher in the OTFC groups in the preoperative holding and postoperative discharge units, the differences among the groups were not statistically significant. Likewise droperidol did not reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting. The data indicate that OTFC may be a safe and effective premedicant in paediatric patients having short operations but delays discharge from the hospital (by 30-50 min) by delaying the time patients tolerate fluids early after operation.\r"

Because data from humans are lacking, we studied the haemodynamic response to phenylephrine (PHE) in eight patients about to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery before and during halothane anaesthesia. After obtaining baseline measurements in patients while awake, the responses to PHE infusion at 30, 40, and 50 micrograms.min-1 were determined. New baseline measurements were made following stabilisation during anaesthesia with halothane, one per cent inspired in oxygen, prior to surgical incision. Then the responses to identical PHE doses were measured again. Halothane did not influence the cardiovascular response to PHE: there was no dose-response shift for any cardiovascular variable. No arrhythmias or signs of ischaemia were observed. We conclude that one per cent halothane anaesthesia does not attenuate PHE-induced vasoconstriction in man.\r"

Seventeen ASA physical status I or II adult patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery received a single injection of 33 ml ropivacaine for subclavian perivascular block and 5 ml to block the intercostobrachial nerve in the axilla. One group (n = 8) received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine without epinephrine (190 mg) and the other (n = 9) received 0.5 per cent ropivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 (190 mg). Plasma ropivacaine concentrations were measured from peripheral venous blood samples taken for 12 hr after drug administration. Ropivacaine base was determined in plasma using gas chromatography and a nitrogen-sensitive detector. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 1.6 +/- 0.6 mg.L-1 and 1.3 +/- 0.4 mg.L-1 after administration of ropivacaine with and without epinephrine. The median time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 0.75 hr and 0.88 hr and the mean area under the plasma concentration curve AUC0-12h was 7.7 +/- 3.6 and 7.0 +/- 3.4 mg.l hr-1. The differences were not statistically significant. The terminal phase of the individual plasma concentration-time curves showed a varying and sometimes slow decline possibly indicating a sustained systemic uptake of ropivacaine from the brachial plexus. No central nervous system or cardiovascular symptoms attributed to systemic plasma concentrations of the drug were observed, with the dose (1.90-3.28 mg.kg-1) of ropivacaine used. It is concluded that the addition of epinephrine does not alter the pharmacokinetic properties of ropivacaine when used for subclavian perivascular brachial plexus block.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP, as determined by radial immunodiffusion, did not differ significantly among the three groups. Five minutes after administration of 1.5 mg.kg-1 intravenous lidocaine, the free fraction of lidocaine correlated inversely and linearly with the serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP in children with acyanotic CHD (r2 = 0.74; P less than 0.001) cyanotic CHD (r2 = 0.57; P less than 0.005), and control (r2 = 0.63; P less than 0.001). The slopes and intercepts of the linear regressions did not differ significantly among the three groups.

Serious deficiencies of anaesthetic equipment previously noted on random survey were confirmed. Recognizing a need for improved standards for delivery of anaesthetic services through safe, functional anaesthetic equipment, the province undertook to fund the upgrading of all anaesthetic gas delivery systems under its jurisdiction. Sixty-six hospitals were surveyed for a total of 203 anaesthetic machines (111 urban, 92 rural). One hundred and sixty-seven machines had been used at least once in the previous year. After careful assessment 92 machines were replaced, 66 machines were upgraded and 45 machines were deleted from further service. Although the maintenance and upgrading of medical equipment is the individual health care facility's responsibility, substantial benefit was recognized by a provincial approach. The authors recommend a similar approach for other Canadian provinces.\r"

Numerous defects of platelet function and coagulation have been associated with amyloidosis, including abnormal platelet aggregation, increased vascular fragility, factor IX and X deficiencies, decreased levels of alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, and increased levels of plasminogen. Intraoperative therapy for our patient included the rapid administration of four units of fresh frozen plasma and ten units of platelet concentrate. A review of the pathology and therapeutic modalities for this potentially life-threatening complication is presented.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro effects of two metabolites of inhalational anaesthetics, fluoride and bromide, on pseudocholinesterase (PCHE) and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activities in the blood samples of seven healthy patients were studied. The PCHE and ACHE activities were determined by kinetic spectrophotometric methods. Fluoride at the levels achieved with clinical concentrations of enflurane and sevoflurane (25-75 microM.L-1) inhibited PCHE activity by 28-65 per cent (P less than 0.01) and ACHE activity by less than five per cent (P greater than 0.05). Bromide at the levels achieved with clinical concentrations of inhalational anaesthetics had no significant effect on either PCHE or ACHE activity. We recommend caution when succinylcholine and/or ester type local anaesthetics are used in the immediate postoperative period following enflurane or sevoflurane anaesthesia. We also recommend that blood drawing for PCHE activity be delayed at least until 24 hr following enflurane or sevoflurane anaesthesia.\r"

Fifty rats were divided into four groups. Groups I and II (n = 10 each) received 3.5 mg.kg-1 0.5 per cent bupivacaine and Groups III and IV (n = 15 each) received 5.0 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine. Groups I and III received pretreatment with normal saline before bupivacaine, whereas Groups II and IV were given pretreatment with nicardipine, 30 mg.kg-1. There was no difference in the incidence of survival between the nicardipine pretreatment group and the saline placebo pretreatment group given 3.5 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine (no fatalities in either group). However, there was significant protection by nicardipine pretreatment in the group given 5 mg.kg-1, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine (13 of 15 survived, compared with only 4 of 15 in the saline pretreatment group, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in rats given 0.5 per cent bupivacaine, 5 mg.kg-1, nicardipine pretreatment protected against fatal cardio-respiratory toxicity.\r"

We assembled and evaluated a low-pressure plenum system, based upon the Farman entrainer, which was adaptable to spontaneous, assisted or intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). The entrainer was tested using a low flow of compressed gas, O2 at 1-3 L.min-1. We measured the fresh gas flow (FGF) and O2 concentrations (F1O2) delivered at various source gas flow rates (O2 flow), and with various breathing circuits. Entrainment ratio, FGF, and F1O2 were highly dependent upon resistance to flow in the different breathing circuits. With a wide bore T-piece the air/O2 entrainment ratio was 6:1, and the F1O2 was 0.3. When circuit resistance was higher, e.g., with the Bain circuit, air entrainment and FGF were reduced, but F1O2 was higher. Because it offered the lowest resistance, the T-piece circuit was selected for a clinical trial.\r"

We first assembled and bench-tested a low-pressure plenum system, based upon the Farman entrainer. The entrainer required a low flow of compressed gas, O2 at 1-2 L.min-1, and generated a low-pressure mixture of O2 and air which was directed through an Oxford miniature vaporizer, a non-return valve, and a widebore T-piece circuit. With this system we anaesthetized 24 patients with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and nine patients breathing spontaneously. During IPPV, the circuit resembled a T-piece and provided effective gas exchange with a FGF of 1.2 times minute ventilation. Inspiratory and expiratory valves were arranged so that the spontaneous mode was non-rebreathing, and FGF was adjusted to equal minute ventilation. The system was very economical, using 1-2 L.min-1 O2 and 20-25 ml.hr-1 liquid halothane to produce a FGF of 6-10 L.min-1, an FIO2 of 0.33, and FIhal of 1-1.5 per cent. We have demonstrated that this is a versatile, safe, and economical system, compatible with the practice of modern inhalational anaesthesia under field conditions. It can be readily assembled from commercially available components.\r"

The serum carotene concentration was very low in the first six months of life. In the first three months of life, breast fed infants had significantly higher serum carotene concentration than infants who were formula fed. Infants 7 to 12 months of age had the highest serum carotene concentration. The serum carotene concentration dropped off after the age of one year and remained low until two years of age. After two years of age, the serum carotene concentration showed a progressive and small rise until the age of six to seven years and then fell until the age of 14 to 18 years. The serum carotene concentration did not appear to vary according to the sex of the child except for infants 7 to 12 months of age. In infants 7 to 12 months of age, girls had a higher serum carotene concentration. The measurement of the serum carotene concentration is a simple screening test for fat malabsorption. Our study provides the normal range of serum carotene concentration for children of various age groups.\r"

Indeed, clinical experience with acromegalics suggests that prolonged exposure to elevated doses of hGH produces detrimental neuromuscular responses. Perhaps an even more intense ethical issue concerns the use of hGH in children and adolescents. The use of hGH to increase height and thereby increase chances for athletic success may be tempting to both coaches and parents. Athletes, parents, coaches, and team physicians must be aware that hGH has not been shown to enhance athletic performance and that its potential long-term side effects are irreversible and even may be life threatening.\r"

It is extensively used for the treatment of congestive heart failure of diverse origin and of cardiac arrhythmias of supraventricular origin. Aging can produce changes in essentially all organ systems, which as a whole render geriatric patients particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of digoxin. Among all age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, declining renal function is perhaps the most important factor that must be considered. This often means a significantly less efficient renal digoxin clearance, which necessitates a reduction in dosage. The geriatric population tends to consume more drugs and are more at risk for undesirable multidrug interactions than their younger counterparts. To name a few, quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and non-K(+)-sparing diuretics are notorious for predisposing the patient to digoxin toxicity when administered concurrently with digoxin. Therefore, digoxin must be prescribed to elderly patients with great judiciousness, with careful interpretation of serum digoxin assay, and due consideration of its intrinsic limitations.\r"

Once the cause of death has been determined, the manner of death needs to be decided. This can produce another group of questions to be addressed by the toxicologist. Items such as route of administration, acute versus chronic dose, and consistency between drug concentrations and behavioral effects may be critical factors in assessing the manner of death. These questions may arise even if the cause of death is ruled not to be drug related.\r"

  ".W": "The process of determining laboratory sectional and departmental costs and test costs for instrument-generated and manually generated reportable results for toxicology laboratories has been outlined in this article. It is hoped that the basic principles outlined in the preceding text will clarify and elucidate one of the most important areas needed for laboratory fiscal integrity and its survival in these difficult times for health care providers. The following general principles derived from this article are helpful aids for managers of toxicology laboratories. 1. To manage a cost-effective, efficient toxicology laboratory, several factors must be considered: the laboratory's instrument configuration, test turnaround time needs, the test menu offered, the analytic methods used, the cost of labor based on time expended and the experience and educational level of the staff, and logistics that determine specimen delivery time and costs. 2. There is a wide variation in costs for toxicologic methods, which requires that an analysis of capital (equipment) purchase and operational (test performance) costs be performed to avoid waste, purchase wisely, and determine which tests consume the majority of the laboratory's resources. 3. Toxicologic analysis is composed of many complex steps. Each step must be individually cost-accounted. Screening test results must be confirmed, and the cost for both steps must be included in the cost per reportable result. 4. Total costs will vary in the same laboratory and between laboratories based on differences in salaries paid to technical staff, differences in reagent/supply costs, the number of technical staff needed to operate the analyzer or perform the method, and the inefficient use of highly paid staff to operate the analyzer or perform the method. 5. Since direct test costs vary directly with the type and number of analyzers or methods and are dependent on the operational mode designed by the manufacturer, laboratory managers should construct an actual test-cost data base for instrument or method in use to accurately compare costs using the \"bottom-up\" approach. 6. Laboratory expenses can be examined from three perspectives: total laboratory, laboratory section, and subsection workstation. The objective is to track all laboratory expenses through each of these levels. 7. In the final analysis, a portion of total laboratory expenses must be allocated to each unit of laboratory output--the billable procedure or, in laboratories where tests are not billed, the tests produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An understanding of horizontal and vertical integration and their quasi-integration variants is important for pathologists to formulate a competitive strategy for hospital clinical laboratories. These basic organizational concepts, in turn, are based on the need to establish control over critical laboratory inputs and outputs. The pathologist seeks greater control of mission-critical system inputs and outputs to increase the quality and efficiency of the laboratory operations. The LIS produces horizontal integration of the various hospital laboratories by integrating them vertically. Forward vertical quasi-integration of the laboratories is mediated primarily by the LIS through front-end valued-added features such as reporting of results and creating a long-term on-line test result archive. These features increase the value of the information product of pathology for clinicians and increase the cost of switching to another system. The LIS can also serve as a means for customizing the information product of the laboratories to appeal to new market segments such as hospital administrators.\r"

However, the optimum dose and most appropriate method of interpreting test results is controversial. We studied 150 consecutive NCCP patients and 50 age-matched controls who alternately received either 80 micrograms/kg or 10 mg intravenous bolus doses of edrophonium preceded by saline placebo injections. Distal esophageal pressures were measured before and after drug injection in response to ten 5-cc wet swallows. Following 10 mg of edrophonium, 33% of patients and 4% of controls reported chest pain, while 29% of patients and no controls receiving the 80 micrograms/kg dose complained of chest pain. Amplitude changes after either dose were not significantly different for all comparisons, but the duration of response did distinguish the two doses in patients with chest pain. A significantly greater (P = 0.01) increase in distal contraction duration occurred after 10 mg (74 +/- 12%; +/- SE) compared to 80 micrograms/kg dose (43 +/- 6%). However, individual responses to the two doses overlapped considerably. If a positive test is redefined to include both chest pain and manometric changes that are significantly different from controls, the positivity rate changes drastically; 33% to 9% in the 10-mg group and 30% to 3% in the 80-micrograms/kg group. Side effects were similar between doses, but there was a significant (P = 0.02) linear relationship between intensity of side effects and the edrophonium dose per kilogram of body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This latter was considered only when no structural abnormalities were found. In all the other cases, a distinction was made between \"related\" and \"associated\" organic dyspepsia according to whether or not there was a certain relationship between the abnormalities and the dyspeptic symptoms. The patients were referred to us as follows: (1) spontaneously, (2) sent by physicians collaborating with us, (3) referred to our open access endoscopic service. The results show the frequency of idiopathic dyspepsia was 26%, whereas associated structural abnormalities were present in 45.4%. Obvious organic causes of dyspepsia were seen in 28.6% (24% benign and 4.6% malignant diseases). When considered separately, no symptom alone allows a correct diagnosis. The simultaneous evaluation of the symptoms with linear discriminant analysis distinguishes between idiopathic and organic dyspeptic patients in about 70% of the cases. A higher discrimination percentage in about 70% of the cases. A higher discrimination percentage could probably be obtained using a wider range of clinical parameters and/or a more complex statistical analysis of the interrelationships which exist between the clinical symptoms and the final diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "We have used double-contrast radiographic techniques to clarify what changes in the configuration and movements of the gastroduodenal junction result when peptic lesions involve the distal gastric segment between the proximal (PPL) and the distal pyloric muscle loop (DPL). Among 50 cases of pyloric ulceration diagnosed during a four-year study period, 18 cases fulfilled all study criteria. Ulcers maintained a consistent location with regard to the muscular structures of the pylorus, and by affecting these structures, led to many strange deformations of the gastric outlet including permanent pseudodiverticula and reversal of pyloric angulation. The most common site for peptic lesions in the pyloric segment was the protuberance of the lesser curvature called the pyloric torus; many torus lesions extended into and destroyed the DPL. This led to widening of the gastric outlet and radiographic evidence of increased duodenogastric reflux. Pyloric closure was further impaired in this setting because the mucosa no longer prolapsed into the gastric outlet and did not occlude the pyloric lumen as it normally does. Less common lesions involved the greater curvature and the PPL. In one patient, scarring of the PPL led to an antral web and gastric hyperperistalsis. This was the only patient who required operation for chronic gastric outlet obstruction. One-third of the 18 patients had reflux esophagitis in addition to peptic pyloric disease. In most patients without additional ulcerogenic risk factors, treatment with antisecretory agents led to the healing of ulcer craters. We conclude that the morphologic and functional changes of the gastric outlet caused by peptic lesions depend, in part, on the effect the ulcer has on the underlying pyloric musculature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The glandular M3 antagonists hexahydrosiladifenidol and silahexocyclium had high affinities of KD 78 +/- 23 nM (n = 5) and 5.6 +/- 1.8 nM (n = 3). The agonist carbachol interacted with a single low-affinity site and binding was insensitive to modulation by guanine nucleotides. Antagonist and agonist binding studies thus showed an affinity profile typical of M3 receptors of the glandular type.\r"

These errors are lower than the nominal quantization error of the instruments and are not properly described by the 24-hr drift determination. The addition of food particles to the solutions can induce severe reading artifacts. The longer response time reported in vitro of antimony electrodes when moving from pH 1 to pH 7 (3.4 sec vs 0.8 sec with glass electrodes) is irrelevant during in vivo pH-metry studies, because we found that the greatest absolute difference between raw fast acquired (4-6 sec) consecutive pH readings of two commonly used devices was 0.7 pH units in circadian profiles obtained from 413 subjects with various clinical conditions. In our in vivo studies, gastric acidity was monitored continuously with two side-by-side minielectrodes, which were variously combined (antimony-glass, A-G; antimony-antimony A1-A2; glass-glass, G1-G2) and applied on groups of 27 subjects matched for clinical condition. The 24-hr pH means and the 24-hr [H+] means calculated from the acidity profiles obtained with the three electrode combinations, lie on the identity line in each group. Using the Bland-Altman technique for assessing measurement agreement, the differences between the 24-hr pH means and the 24-hr [H+] means obtained with the three combined systems are similar (P = .903 and P = 0.824, respectively) and their 95% confidence limits are comprised within the range (+/-) of the reading error of the measuring systems (namely, +/- 0.3 pH units and +/- 12 mmol/liter in terms of [H+]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Continuous 24-hr pH recordings in 150 nonsmokers and 174 smokers receiving placebo treatment were compared. Daytime intragastric acidity was higher in smokers with a median pH (interquartile range) of 1.56 (1.34-1.80) than in nonsmokers, who had a median pH of 1.70 (1.45-1.97) (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in 24-hr and nighttime median pH between the two groups. The small difference in daytime intragastric acidity in smokers and nonsmokers is unlikely to account for the increased prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in smokers. The analysis of smoking status in duodenal ulcer patients and healthy controls and males and females supports the general trend towards higher daytime acidity in smokers. Again, no differences in pH during the 24-hr or night period were found between the groups. The epidemiological and clinical correlation between smoking and duodenal ulcer disease is not adequately explained by increased intragastric acidity.\r"

Whenever patients of the control group or patients with renal diseases suffered from ulcers, PGE2-like immunoactivity, compared to nonulcer subjects, revealed a decrease of about 60-70% in the nonulcerated mucosa. Compared to nonulcerated mucosa, the tissue of the ulcer rim in all patients with gastric ulcer showed a relative increase in PGE2-like immunoactivity, eg, PGE2-like immunoactivity was twice as high in tissue from the ulcer rim. The output of PGE2-like immunoactivity into the gastric juice of subjects without renal diseases was comparable to that found in patients with chronic uremia in both basal and pentagastrin-stimulated conditions. We therefore conclude that gastric mucosal formation is probably not influenced by chronic uremia.\r"

Four groups of 20 healthy volunteers with endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosa received naproxen (500 mg twice a day) plus cimetidine (300 mg four times a day or 400 mg twice a day), sucralfate (1 g four times a day), or placebo for seven days. After seven days of therapy, a second endoscopy was performed. Separate scoring systems were used for the presence of hemorrhages, erosions, and a combination of both types of injury. There were significantly fewer mucosal hemorrhages present when naproxen and cimetidine were administered than when naproxen was administered with placebo or sucralfate (placebo vs 300 mg cimetidine, P = 0.04, and placebo vs 400 mg cimetidine, P = 0.006, placebo vs sucralfate, P = 0.26). Both cimetidine dosages resulted in significantly fewer hemorrhages than were present following cotherapy of naproxen and sucralfate (P less than 0.05).

Cisapride reduced mean gastric emptying time of 99mTc-labeled cellulose fiber [0.77 (0.69-1.12) hr [median (range)] vs 0.98 (0.63-1.95) hr; P less than 0.05] and 1- to 2-mm 111In-labeled plastic particles [1.08 (0.50-1.42) hr vs 1.69 (0.59-3.03) hr; P less than 0.01]. Cisapride also decreased mean small intestinal transit time of cellulose fiber [2.11 (0.80-5.08) hr vs 2.82 (0.78-7.12) hr; P less than 0.05] and plastic particles [2.06 (1.13-5.13) hr vs 2.64 (1.18-7.04) hr; P less than 0.05]. However, cisapride increased mean large intestinal transit time of plastic particles [31 (13-75) hr vs 23 (12-36) hr; P less than 0.05]. In conclusion, oral cisapride 10 mg four times a day accelerates gastric emptying and small intestinal transit whereas this dose of cisapride seems to delay large intestinal transit of solids in healthy humans.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the longitudinal effects of autotransplantation on the motor function of the jejunoileum. By performing the autotransplantation procedure in a manner similar to that employed for allotransplantation, we sought to examine the long-term effects of both extrinsic denervation and the operative procedure itself on small intestinal motor function. Although initially disrupted, interdigestive myoelectrical activity demonstrated progressive organization: 88% of migrating myoelectrical complexes in animals studied between 12 and 20 months following autotransplantation demonstrated each phase of the complex in normal sequence. Longitudinal studies of several parameters of myoelectrical activity provided further evidence of progressive organization and entrainment of motor functions within the denervated intestine. Several abnormal myoelectrical patterns were observed within the autotransplanted segment, however, and coordination of either slow wave or phase III activity with the proximal innervated intestine did not recover with time. The major component of the myoelectrical response to feeding was permanently impaired with a delayed onset and shortened duration of the fed response. We conclude that the extrinsically denervated intestine recovers the ability to generate and organize all phases of the MMC but demonstrates permanent impairment of the major motor response to food. However, anoxic and cooling damage to enteric nerves and muscle, incurred during the autotransplantation procedure, may explain the persistence of abnormal motor patterns and impaired myoelectrical conduction and could play an important role, additional to that of extrinsic denervation, in the long-term motor function of the allotransplanted intestine.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of gastrointestinal mucin and/or the formation of mucoid caps have been implicated in cytoprotective or repair mechanisms related to mucosal injury models. In this study, rats were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or prostaglandins (PG), and their effects on the synthesis and secretion of small intestinal mucin were examined. A newly developed polyclonal antibody to rat intestinal mucin was used for immunoassay of rat intestinal luminal and tissue mucin. The mucin antigen source was obtained by vacuum aspiration of luminal mucus. A high-molecular-weight glycoprotein (2 x 10(6) Da) fraction injected into rabbits produced a primary mucin antibody. A sensitive and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that yielded a highly reproducible and linear response with mucin aliquots containing 0-20 ng of protein/ml. Incorporation of the plasma tracers ([3H]glucose and [35S]sodium sulfate) into mucin derived from hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide precipitation after treatment with ASA (100 mg/kg body wt) decreased, although administration of dimethylprostaglandin E2 (100 micrograms/kg body wt) significantly increased the specific tracer incorporation values for the sialomucin and sulfomucin indices in luminal mucin fractions. The immunoassay data pattern for the ELISA technique was virtually identical to the results of the radiolabeled tracer method obtained for the same pharmacologic treatments. These experiments demonstrate that the estimation of synthesized mucin (tissue source) or secreted mucin (luminal source) as determined by the ELISA technique is similar to that obtained by the time-consuming and labor-intensive tracer incorporation methodology.\r"

The low calorie bland meal emptied rapidly from both the proximal and distal stomach after a short lag period (4-6 min), during which 24-50% of the liquid passed into the distal stomach. Addition of margarine to the liquid test meal increased the lag period (median 32 min, range 7-60 min; p less than 0.01) and decreased the slope of emptying (T1/2 lag period 88 min, 49-146 min v 15 min, 10-57 min; p less than 0.01). During the lag period there was an initial filling of the distal stomach, similar to that with the bland liquid, followed by a redistribution of between 19% and 61% (median 46%) of the distal stomach contents back into the proximal stomach. At the onset of emptying, the distal stomach filled (median 30%, range 16-34%) and during this time the proximal stomach emptied twice as fast as the whole stomach (p less than 0.05). Thereafter, the distal stomach capacity remained relatively constant while both the proximal and whole stomach emptied at similar rates. This study shows that the delay in gastric emptying of a liquid that has a high fat content is due in part to a redistribution of distal stomach contents back into the proximal stomach.\r"

Paf-acether (paf) causes a number of disorders including ischaemic bowel necrosis and gastroduodenal ulceration. Since paf is produced by Escherichia coli, we investigated whether it could be synthesised by H pylori. Five H pylori isolates were collected from antral biopsy specimens from patients with gastritis and duodenal ulcer and cultured with selective antibiotics. Colonies obtained from both blood agar and brucella broth medium were used. Paf was determined by platelet aggregation assay after ethanolic extraction and subsequent purification by high performance liquid chromatography. Paf was detected in H pylori in blood agar plates (680 (390) pg paf/1 x 10(6) organisms) but not in bacteria cultured on brucella broth medium. Supplementation of the latter medium with lyso paf and acetyl-CoA, two paf precursors present in high amounts in the mammalian intestine, induced paf production in three of five isolates. The platelet aggregating material extracted from H pylori exhibited biological and physiochemical characteristics identical to those of paf released from eukaryotic cells. These findings suggest that H pylori may add to the local production of paf in inflamed gastric mucosa.\r"

An intragastric glass electrode continuously monitored acidity and this information was automatically computed to regulate an intravenous infusion system (GastroJet). The computer was programmed to aim for pH 6.0, increasing and lowering infusion rates accordingly. Two regimens were compared with placebo (10 mg bolus followed by infusion or infusion of famotidine alone). Volunteers were admitted to an investigation ward and each study was preceded by a standard normal meal. Hydration was maintained with intravenous fluids. During placebo treatment the median pH was 1.5 and the pH was less than 5.0 for 98% of the time. All volunteers responded to famotidine but dosage requirements varied (range 41 mg to 126 mg). The median pH rose to 6.5 when infusions of famotidine followed boluses and to 6.6 when infusions alone were used - the pH was less than 5.0 for 20% and 16% of the time respectively (p less than 0.05 Wilcoxon compared with placebo).

Famotidine infused by GastroJet maintains a high fasting intragastric pH and priming boluses are probably unnecessary.\r"

Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia.\r"

Forty per cent of the total calories were given as fat, as butter (high saturated fat), olive oil (high monounsaturated fat), or corn oil (high polyunsaturated fat), with one group on low fat (10% of calories) standard laboratory diet as controls. During in vivo jejunal perfusion studies we found that (i) a polyunsaturated fat (corn oil) supplemented diet improves jejunal absorption of water and electrolytes and these changes are independent of the observed concentrations of luminal prostaglandins; (ii) high dietary fat appreciably reduced the secretory response to cholera toxin, probably without fundamentally changing the mechanism by which cholera toxin induces secretion. We conclude that dietary fat composition altered the permeability and transport characteristics of the small intestine. This observation might have relevance to some human diarrhoeal disorders.\r"

The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Polyploidy was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had carcinoma or dysplasia. In the non-dysplastic patients all samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy. Some 10% of samples without inflammation, however, also showed polyploidy. A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of dysplasia. Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis and could be considered for screening high risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during treatment with olsalazine and mesalazine, 14 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned to olsalazine (1 g twice daily) and the mesalazines, Asacol (800 + 400 + 800 mg daily), Pentasa (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily), and Salofalk (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily) in a crossover design trial so that all received each drug for seven days. Intraluminal colonic concentrations of 5-ASA were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven. The 5-ASA and acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23.7 (SEM) (1.9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (5-ASA) compared with equimolar doses of Pentasa (12.6 (2.2) mmol/l; p less than 0.0003) and Salofalk (15.0 (2.0) mmol/l; p less than 0.003). At the same time, olsalazine treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0.05) of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA compared with the mesalazine preparations. The low systemic load of 5-ASA provided by olsalazine reduces the potential risk of nephrotoxicity during long term treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is now frequently offered to patients with slow transit constipation who have severe symptoms and no response to more conventional medical treatment. If this operation is to be successful, the underlying problem should be delay in the progress of contents through the colon but no mechanical or functional obstruction in the small bowel or rectum. We have used a recently described technique of prolonged ambulant manometry and electromyography to investigate anorectal function in these patients. Pressure data were collected using a 2 mm diameter intrarectal probe carrying microtransducers, and external anal sphincter activity was assessed by a pair of silver-silver chloride surface electrodes. Fourteen control subjects and eight patients with colonic inertia were studied. Sampling reflexes, indicative of rectal filling, occurred at mean (SEM) rates of 7.4 (2.0)/hour in controls but were significantly reduced in patients (2.4 (0.3)/hour (p less than 0.01]. Recurrent rectal motor complexes were seen to occur in both groups at intervals of 76 (1.8) minutes in controls and 64.9 (7.2) minutes in patients (p less than 0.1), and with amplitudes of 42.4 (2.1) mmHg and 9.2 (0.7) mmHg (p less than 0.001), respectively. External sphincter electromyographic spike activity did not differ between groups. Our results support the concept of reduced transit of faeces to the rectum from the colon over a 24 hour period in slow transit constipation and suggest that a motor neuropathy may also be present in the rectum.\r"

The electrodes were implanted at positions between 8 and 25 cm from the anal verge in different subjects. The frequency of myoelectrical burst activity together with the burst duration recorded by each electrode pair was examined. The relation of burst frequency and burst duration in the higher and lower placed electrodes was also assessed. In none of the subjects was three evidence of synchrony between the electrode pairs. In addition, there was no relation between the relative position of the electrodes and the intrinsic frequency of duration of myoelectrical bursts. It is concluded that regions of smooth muscle in the unstimulated human colon in vivo act independently and that there is no effective common neuromuscular drive under these conditions.\r"

A total of 447 (2.6%) were positive and underwent large bowel investigations. No neoplastic disease was identified in 283 (63%) of them. Fourteen (5%) also underwent gastroscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, benign conditions were identified in five and a gastric carcinoma in one. No further investigations were instituted in the remaining 269 subjects who have now been followed up for a median period of 5 years (2-8 years). Five have been referred for benign upper gastrointestinal conditions, but none for upper gastrointestinal malignancy. Thirty one subjects have died - one from gastric cancer (a patient who had undergone a previous partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer and who had persistent upper gastrointestinal symptoms). The remaining deaths were unrelated to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Nineteen people who have left the trial area have been monitored for the development of malignant disease; none have presented with upper gastrointestinal malignancy. These data support the view that upper gastrointestinal investigations need not be performed routinely in this group of subjects, but may be reserved for those with relevant symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Because several studies have suggested that beta blockers are effective in the prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, screening for oesophageal varices might be appropriate. We prospectively studied 84 cirrhotic patients without obvious evidence of large oesophageal varices and previous bleeding during a mean follow up of 16 months. At entry to the study 41 patients had no oesophageal varices and in 43 these were grade 1. The subsequent percentages of patients without large oesophageal varices were 74% at one year and 52% at two years. Univariate analysis showed that a longer duration of cirrhosis (p less than 0.05) and grade 1 oesophageal varices at entry (p less than 0.001) were predictive factors for the occurrence of large oesophageal varices, whereas, multivariate analysis showed that the initial size of the oesophageal varices (p less than 0.001), a high initial Child-Pugh score, and a smaller improvement in Child-Pugh score during the study were independent risk factors. Among patients with grades 0 and 1 oesophageal varices at the start of the study the proportions with large oesophageal varices at two years were 31% and 70% respectively. We have calculated that, accepting a maximum risk of first bleeding of 10% without prophylactic treatment, a patient without oesophageal varices should be screened endoscopically every other year, while a patient with grade 1 disease should benefit from one annual upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.\r"

Laparoscopy retains its essential role in selected cases. Complementary use of fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance and laparoscopy assures the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma.

In all subjects the following parameters were studied before, during, and for 10 minutes after secretin administration: (a) calibre of the portal vein, (b) mean velocity of portal venous flow, and (c) volume of portal venous flow. In three subjects in each group we also evaluated the changes in flow in the superior mesenteric artery. Secretin injection induced a slight increase in both groups in comparison to basal values of portal vein calibre (mean of maximal per cent increase +25% in group A, not significant, and +16.7% in group B, not significant) and a noticeable increase of mean velocity (mean of maximal per cent increases +61.4% in group A, p less than 0.005, and +65.4% in group B, p less than 0.01) and flow volume (mean of maximal per cent increase +127% group A, p less than 0.005, and +114% group B, p less than 0.005). The magnitude of the haemodynamic changes did not differ significantly between the two groups. Doppler investigation of the superior mesenteric artery showed a marked increase of flow velocity (mean of maximal per cent increase +218% in group A and +246% in group B) and flow volume (mean of maximal per cent increase +276% in group A and +311% in group B).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The generation of hepatic liver peroxidation by free radicals has been proposed as a mechanism for ethanol induced hepatotoxicity. To investigate this hypothesis, lipid extracts from hepatic needle biopsy specimens from alcoholic subjects were examined for evidence of lipid peroxidation by measuring total conjugated dienes by derivative spectroscopy and, after hydrolysis of hepatic lipid extract and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, the molar ratio between a diene-conjugated linoleic acid isomer (18:2 (9,11)) and the parent linoleic acid isomer (18:2(9,12)). Changes were related to hepatic histology, iron deposition, glutathione and vitamin E values. Derivative spectroscopy minima suggestive of diene conjugation were identified at 233 and 242 nm and correlated weakly, suggesting these two minima may represent different classes of lipid dienes. There was a weak relation with inflammatory histological changes in the biopsy specimen but no correlation with hepatic iron grade, glutathione, or vitamin E lipid ratio. The proportion of 18:2(9,11) linoleic acid in hepatic lipids correlated significantly with inflammatory histological features and inversely with hepatic glutathione. Furthermore, hepatic glutathione was lower in biopsy specimens with greater iron staining. The ratio of vitamin E to lipid was not related to histological group, inflammation, or iron grade. These findings suggest that excess alcohol consumption leads to hepatic inflammation and lipid peroxidation.\r"

PSTI was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay in biopsy specimens taken from the upper (n = 8) and lower (n = 7) gastrointestinal tract of patients with normal endoscopies. PSTI was present in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Concentrations (micrograms/g protein) were highest in the stomach, and significantly higher in the antrum (1240, 670-1700, median and range) than in the gastric body (370, 350-570) (p less than 0.01). Concentrations were similar in the duodenum (180, 80-210) and colon (160, 130-360). PSTI determined by immunohistochemistry was present in mucus secreting gastric foveolar cells, duodenal Paneth cells, and colonic non mucus cells. PSTI was present in gastric juice. The median (range) concentration of PSTI in basal gastric juice from 13 patients with duodenal ulcers was 9 (3-21) micrograms/l and did not change during stimulation with pentagastrin. The rate of secretion, however, did increase significantly (p less than 0.05) from 1430 (180-2810) ng/h to 4500 (1250-12,770) ng/h during pentagastrin stimulation. PSTI was labile in acid pepsin but stable in the neutral conditions present in the mucus layer. The presence of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor throughout the gut and its secretion into the lumen suggests a hitherto unrecognised mechanism protecting gastrointestinal epithelia against luminal proteases.\r"

Conventional enzyme replacement, with cimetidine as an adjunct, was compared to supplementation with enteric coated microspheres. In healthy control subjects, 14CO2 excretion rose rapidly and peaked at 90-120 minutes; mean (SD) cumulative recovery at four hours was 51 (8)%. In patients with pancreatic insufficiency on no treatment mean (SD) cumulative recovery was only 6 (4)%. After pancreatin, with previous administration of cimetidine, it increased to 27 (11)% with a time course resembling that in controls. With 2 mm enteric coated microspheres, 14CO2 excretion did not rise significantly before 120 minutes and cumulative recovery after four hours was 15 (11)%. In a control study, 2 mm radio-opaque microspheres did not empty from the stomach until two hours after ingestion. The results suggest that the cholesteryl octanoate breath test can be successfully used to monitor the intraluminal enzymatic activity after treatment with different forms of enzyme replacement in pancreatic insufficiency. In contrast to treatment with conventional pancreatin and cimetidine as an adjunct, 2 mm enteric coated microspheres did not show in vivo enzymatic activity until two hours after administration.\r"

Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colonic malignancy and Crohn's disease is also associated with both small and large bowel carcinoma. Most previous reports of stomal carcinoma have been associated with ulcerative colitis although Crohn's disease seems to carry a greater risk of associated small bowel carcinomas. This is the first report of stomal carcinoma complicating Crohn's disease. Epithelial dysplasia is associated with gastrointestinal carcinomas in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence has been suggested as the origin of these tumours. In both our patients with stomal adenocarcinoma, dysplasia was identified in adjacent tissues, which suggests a similar mechanism. Malignant change should be suspected if epithelial dysplasia is discovered in a biopsy specimen from the mucosa of an ileostomy in Crohn's disease, and this risk is increased if the dysplasia is of a high grade.\r"

The complement receptor activity was measured by immune adherence utilizing a rosette technique. Patients with terminal kidney failure on the hemodialysis program exhibited significantly lower values of the erythrocyte CR1 activity in comparison with healthy controls. The circulating immune complexes did not affect erythrocyte CR1 activity. After successful renal transplantation, irrespective of the immunosuppressive program used, a significant increase in erythrocyte CR1 activity appeared, similar to control group values. However, the activity of erythrocyte CR1, in the graft recipients under cyclosporin A treatment, was significantly higher than in the patients receiving azathioprine with prednisone. Therefore, it is possible that cyclosporin A, transported in the erythrocytes, modifies the complement receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "It has been claimed that computed urea kinetic (UK) modelling in hemodialysed patients, for the estimation of protein intake, leads to an overestimation of protein catabolic rate (PCR). In the present study, three different methods of kinetic modelling for the determination of PCR and Kt/V are compared in 24 patients. The first method was the direct quantification method (DDQ) based on the collection of all urea eliminated from the body. The first computed method (ICMI) was the urea kinetic modelling method as described by Sargent. Dialyzer clearances were measured directly and not estimated by theoretical extrapolation. The second computed method (ICMII) is based on the indirect calculation of urea distribution volume (Vu), according to Watson, and of dialyzer clearances from this Vu and from pre- and post-dialysis urea concentrations. All three methods resulted in PCR's that were not significantly different (DDQ: 1.03 +/- 0.19; ICMI: 1.04 +/- 0.22; ICMII: 1.08 +/- 0.25 mg/Kg BW.24 hrs; p greater than 0.05). When the results were correlated, the following results were obtained: ICMI vs ICMII: r = 0.89, p less than 0.001; ICMI vs DDQ: r = 0.68, p less than 0.01; DDQ vs ICMII: r = 0.78, p less than 0.001. Intermutual comparison of Kt/V values resulted in virtually identical results, especially when comparing ICMI and ICMII, where the regression line equalled the identity line. In conclusion, all methods seem equally reliable in determining mean PCR and Kt/V. Our data, obtained with directly measured dialyzer urea clearances, do not confirm the earlier held opinion that computed modelling results in an overestimation of PCR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our TH-7B pneumatically driven, sac-type ventricular assist device was used in 7 adult mongrel dogs. RSNA was detected by the use of bipolar electrodes attached to the left renal sympathetic nerve. RSNA was amplified and integrated by use of an R-C integrator circuit. The area of the integrated nerve discharge per unit time was calculated in the computer system and expressed as RSNA per unit time. During LVAD pumping, RSNA decreased with increase in blood pressure, with an increase in pulmonary artery flow, and with a decrease in left atrial pressure. These data suggest that LVAD has an effect on the sympathetic nervous system which is mediated by the aortic and cardiopulmonary baroreflex system.\r"

We propose a device able to regulate the pump speed accordingly to the level in the oxygenator, and an automatic clamp to control venous return from the patient. The level regulator permits pump speed control and also stops the pump when a prefixed low level is reached (during ECC). Linearization of the level sensor has been made in order to optimize the PI regulator. Simulation results are presented and the regulator is evaluated in a clinical environment. The automatic clamp provides a good solution for reproducible and easy transitions in venous return. When coupled with the level regulator, the pump speed will increase automatically from zero to the correct equilibrium speed, with variable duration (from 30 seconds to 5 minutes) chosen by the operator. The same technique is used for stopping the ECC. These two devices are, in fact, modules, making up part of an evolutive device for ECC automation. The modules can exchange data with a supervising microcomputer.\r"

Results of C3a generation rate showed a significant activation by all blood tubings, with a reduced rate with PIV when compared to all others. Electron scanning microscopy showed marked alterations of PIV surface on tubings stored for 6 months. Protein deposits on internal surfaces after dialysis were similar whatever tubing material was tested, but adhesive cell number was greater with TRI when compared to PVC and LTP. Hemocompatibility is unchanged with phthalate-free tubings when compared to phthalate plasticised ones. In contrast with phthalate plasticised PVC there is no beneficial effect of polyurethane coextrusion with trimellitate plasticised PVC in regard to C3a generation.\r"

After a medial parapatellar arthrotomy and lateral dislocation of the patella, the surface of the articular cartilage was exposed to air for one, two, and three hours in forty-five rabbits. Reversibility of the changes was assessed in fifteen rabbits after exposure of the cartilage to air for three hours, closure of the joint, and six weeks of recovery. Histochemical and ultrastructural changes were evaluated, with use of the contralateral non-exposed knee joint as a control. Depletion of glycosaminoglycans in the matrix of articular cartilage, as indicated by a loss of surface staining with toluidine blue, occurred after one hour of exposure to air. Ultrastructural changes occurred in chondrocytes throughout the full thickness of articular cartilage after one hour of exposure. Increases in the time of exposure to air resulted in more pronounced ultrastructural abnormalities in chondrocytes throughout the entire thickness of the articular cartilage, but there was no apparent irreversible cellular injury. Six weeks after arthrotomy, the chondrocytes had fully recovered from the changes that had been noted immediately after exposure to air, and they were devoid of degenerative changes. The cells showed ultrastructural evidence of increased metabolic activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In addition, the chondrocytes had partially restored the depleted glycosaminoglycans.\r"

The method was associated with a sixfold increase in the rate of accrual of patients as compared with the use of a classic randomization trial.

All fractures were irrigated and debrided, and antibiotics were given for a minimum of forty-eight hours after the injury. Twenty fractures were initially treated with external fixation and twenty-two, with immobilization in a plaster cast. Three patients had an early infection of the wound, one of which was associated with osteomyelitis; all were successfully treated. The average time to healing of the fracture was five months (range, two to twenty-one months). The time to union was related to the severity of the soft-tissue injury, the pattern of the fracture, the amount of segmental bone loss, the occurrence of infection, and the use of external fixation. There were six delayed unions. Four patients had an angular malunion of more than 10 degrees, which spontaneously corrected in three. One patient who had a proximal metaphyseal-diaphyseal segmental fracture had a progressive valgus deformity. Four patients who had a severe fracture that was treated with external fixation had more than one centimeter of tibial over-growth. There were no amputations. The incidences of compartment syndrome, vascular injury, infection, and delayed union were similar to those reported for open tibial fractures in adults.\r"

An above-the-knee amputation was done in seven; a resection arthrodesis, in nine; and a replacement arthroplasty, in six. The patients all walked at a similar speed (sixty-one to sixty-six meters per minute), which is slower than normal (eighty meters per minute). They all walked with comparable efficiency at three velocities: the mean consumption of oxygen was 0.210 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter at free velocity, 0.215 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 25 per cent faster, and 0.211 to 0.240 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 50 per cent faster. The three groups of patients and a normal control group consumed oxygen at similar rates. The patients who had had an amputation were very active, and they were the least worried about damaging the affected limb, but they had difficulty walking on steep, rough, or slippery surfaces. The patients who had had an arthrodesis had a more stable limb and performed the most demanding physical work and recreational activities, but they had difficulty sitting. The patients who had had an arthroplasty led sedentary lives and were the most protective of the limb, but they were the least self-conscious about the limb.\r"

A radiopaque suspension was injected into the anterior circumflex, posterior circumflex, suprascapular, thoracoacromial, or subscapular artery and then the specimens were dissected and were analyzed macroscopically, and radiographs were made in three mutually perpendicular projections. In addition, sixteen of the specimens were cut into four-millimeter slices and were studied microradiographically. The humeral head was shown to have been perfused by the anterolateral ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery in all specimens. That vessel ran parallel to the lateral aspect of the tendon of the long head of the biceps and entered the humeral head where the proximal end of the intertubercular groove met the greater tuberosity. When the intraosseous (terminal) part of the anterolateral branch, the so-called arcuate artery, had been perfused, almost the entire epiphysis was radiopaque. The posterior circumflex artery vascularized only the posterior portion of the greater tuberosity and a small posteroinferior part of the head. Anastomoses between the different arteries were abundant, but vascularization of all of the humeral head was possible only through the anterolateral branch of the anterior circumflex artery.\r"

In this study, we used a newly developed technique of in situ fixation and embedding to define the cross-sectional anatomy at the level of the conus medullaris in ten fresh human cadavera. A highly organized overlapping pattern of nerve roots was demonstrated in all specimens. The nerve roots form a peripheral rim around the spinal cord at the levels of the tenth and eleventh and the eleventh and twelfth thoracic intervertebral discs. More caudally, the cord diminishes in size and the nerve roots predominate. The most cephalad roots lie laterally, with the motor roots ventral to their sensory counterparts. The more caudad roots overlap toward the midline, and the motor and sensory portions of each root are separated by spinal cord tissue. An intricate web of arachnoid membrane holds the nerve roots in a fixed relationship to each other.\r"

Other complications included avascular necrosis (fourteen hips), chondrolysis (nine), fracture (one), infection (one), further slippage (one), sciatic-nerve injury (one), and breakage of a screw (eight). Ways of decreasing the incidence of complications of fixation were explored.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred and eight siblings, parents, and grandparents of seventy-eight children from the New England area who had congenital dysplasia of the hip were evaluated, by clinical examination and by measurements of the acetabulum on pelvic radiographs, for the signs and sequelae of congenital dysplasia of the hip. Six siblings and four mothers (representing seven of seventy-eight families) had been diagnosed with congenital dysplasia of the hip during childhood. The other ninety-one siblings were asymptomatic and had no radiographic evidence of dysplasia of the hip. In the adults in these families, acetabular coverage (as measured by the center-edge angle of Wiberg) was no different from that in the control subjects. There was no difference between the study group and the control subjects in the prevalence of osteoarthrosis of the hip or of osteoarthrosis that could be considered secondary to congenital dysplasia of the hip. The results indicate that children born to families that have a history of congenital dysplasia of the hip have a greater prevalence of this problem compared with the general population, but also that examinations of the hip in newborns are effective in detecting congenital dysplasia of the hip in such families. The greater prevalence of congenital disease of the hip among the siblings and mothers in these families is consistent with a multifactorial inheritance. The fact that acetabular development in the family members who did not have congenital dysplasia of the hip was no different from that in the control subjects suggests that acetabular dysplasia, rather than being an inherited abnormality, is secondary to subluxation or dislocation.\r"

The lesion was defined as a diastasis of two to five millimeters between the bases of the first and second metatarsals, as seen on anteroposterior radiographs. There often was a long delay between injury and diagnosis. Eight patients were treated with a below-the-knee cast only, three had treatment with a cast and then tarsometatarsal arthrodesis, two had no initial treatment but later had arthrodesis, and two had open reduction and internal fixation. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to thirteen years after the diagnosis. There was no correlation between the severity of the diastasis and the patient's functional result. Marked disability and pain persisted in seven patients, and six of them had flattening of the longitudinal arch. Maintenance of the longitudinal arch usually was associated with a better functional outcome. When a patient has a subtle injury of the Lisfranc joint, weight-bearing lateral radiographs of both feet are needed to identify flattening of the longitudinal arch. Such radiographs should be made routinely in the evaluation of all injuries of the foot that may involve the Lisfranc joint.\r"

Radiation film dosimeters were placed at four gonadal sites on each subject. A standard male-gonad cup or a pelvic drape of 0.5-millimeter-thick lead-equivalent was put in place to shield the gonads. A second set of four dosimeters was placed external to the shield to approximate unprotected exposure. The total duration of the fluoroscopy averaged five minutes (range, thirty seconds to fourteen minutes). The total exposure to radiation external to the shield was 35 +/- 34 millirems at the male gonadal sites and 17 +/- 11 millirems at the female gonadal sites. With use of the gonadal shield, exposure to radiation was not measurable in thirteen of the fifteen patients. The differences between the exposures of the shielded and unshielded sites to radiation were statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The highest level of gonadal exposure was found with the treatment of proximal femoral fractures and with the use of statically locked nails. Regardless of the conditions, and for all types of fractures and locations, our results demonstrated that gonadal shielding is justified.\r"

An average of seven years postoperatively, the graft seemed to have been a successful adjunct to the arthroplasty. Five years later, to assess our long-term results, we reviewed the findings in the same forty-six hips (thirty-seven patients) that we had studied previously. An average of 11.8 years after the total replacement and use of the autogenous femoral-head graft, nine hips (20 per cent) needed a second operation because the acetabular fixation had failed. Two had had a resection arthroplasty and seven, a complex revision. In one additional hip, a resection arthroplasty was done for infection that had developed after operative reattachment of the greater trochanter. In twelve of the remaining thirty-six hips, there was definite radiographic evidence of acetabular loosening. Thus, the total incidence of loosening of the acetabular component was 46 per cent (twenty-one hips). The average time from the index operation to the first definite radiographic evidence that the fixation had failed was 6.4 years (range, 2.9 to 12.7 years). While we recognize that application of a bulk autogenous graft to the acetabulum is useful when the acetabular bone stock is extremely deficient, we no longer recommend the use of bulk corticocancellous autogenous grafts in other situations.\r"

To further explore the significance of IGF-I mRNA expression in these tumors, a more extensive analysis was performed. Most (9 of 10) neuroectodermal tumor cell lines with a t(11;22) translocation (primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], Ewing's sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I mRNA, whereas 0 of 15 cell lines without the translocation (PNET, neuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I. Furthermore, inasmuch as all neuroblastoma (12 of 12) cell lines examined expressed IGF-II RNA, the pattern of IGF expression could distinguish between these closely related tumors. CHP-100, a PNET cell line with the t(11;22) translocation, was shown to secrete both IGF-I protein and an IGF binding protein, IGFBP-2. This cell line also expressed the type I IGF receptor mRNA, and blockade of this receptor by a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR3) inhibited serum-free growth. These data demonstrate that IGF-I expression is a property of neuroectodermal tumors with a t(11;22) translocation and that interruption of an IGF-I autocrine loop inhibits the growth of these tumor cells.\r"

To determine the relationship between the fluid-phase activation of complement and our observation that only strains isolated from patients with invasive disease are resistant to complement-mediated lysis, we investigated the fate of C3 with recent amebic isolates. When 125I-C3 was incubated with trophozoites in serum, C3 in the fluid phase was cleaved to C3b or C3bi, but the alpha chain of the C3 molecules on the cell surface appeared intact. Since the lysis of nonpathogenic strains takes place in the absence of bound C3b, we demonstrated that this reaction occurs by reactive lysis initiated in the fluid phase: (a) the killing of nonpathogenic strains was enhanced when alternative pathway activation was accelerated by the addition of cobra venom factor; (b) non-pathogenic strains were lysed by purified terminal components; and (c) sera incubated with pathogenic E. histolytica produced passive lysis of chicken erythrocytes. These results demonstrate for the first time that complement-sensitive E. histolytica are lysed by activation of the terminal complement components in the fluid phase where the 56-kD neutral cysteine proteinase cleaves C3, and not by the surface deposition of activated C3.\r"

Phosphate metabolites were monitored in an open chest sheep preparation using a 31P magnetic resonance surface coil over the left ventricle. Newborn lambs (aged 4-9 d, n = 5) underwent exchange transfusion with adult blood to reduce blood-borne 2,3-diphosphoglycerate contamination of the heart monophosphate and phosphomonoester resonances, thus allowing determination of these phosphate concentrations. The blood-exchanged newborns and mature controls (aged 30-60 d, n = 5) were infused with 0.4 N hydrochloric acid to decrease pH from greater than 7.35 to less than 7.00. Simultaneously, intracellular and extracellular pH were determined from the chemical shifts of the respective phosphate peaks and compared to arterial blood pH. Findings were as follows: (a) diphosphoglycerate contribution to the cardiac spectrum was found to be negligible, (b) significant decreases in cytosolic phosphate (P less than 0.03) and phosphomonoester (P less than 0.01) content occurred with maturation, and (c) large decreases in extracellular pH (greater than 0.5 U) in both groups were similarly associated with only small changes in intracellular pH (less than 0.1 U). Change in cytosolic phosphate content implies that alterations occur in the phosphorylation potential with resulting effects on regulation of myocardial respiration, and cardiac energetics.\r"

  ".W": "By cable analysis and intracellular microelectrode impalement in the in vitro perfused renal tubule, we identified alpha- and beta-intercalated (IC) cells along the rabbit distal nephron segments, including the connecting tubule (CNT), the cortical collecting duct (CCD), and the outer medullary collecting duct in the inner stripe (OMCDi). IC cells were distinguished from collecting duct (CD) cells by a relatively low basolateral membrane potential (VB), a higher fractional apical membrane resistance, and apparent high Cl- conductances of the basolateral membrane. Two functionally different subtypes of IC cells in the CCD were identified based on different responses of VB upon reduction of the perfusate Cl- from 120 to 12 mM: the basolateral membrane of beta-IC cells was hyperpolarized, whereas that of alpha-IC cells was unchanged. This is in accord with the hypothesis that the apical membrane of beta-IC cells contains some Cl(-)-dependent entry processes, possibly a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. Further characterization of electrical properties of both subtypes of IC cells were performed upon lowering bath or perfusate Cl- from 120 to 12 mM, and raising bath or perfusate K+ from 5 to 50 mM. A 10-fold increase in the perfusate K+ had no effect on VB in both subtypes of IC cells. Upon abrupt changes in Cl- or K+ concentration in the bath, a large or a small depolarization of the basolateral membrane, respectively, was observed in both subtypes of IC cells. The electrical properties of alpha- and beta-IC cells were similar among the distal nephron segments, but their distribution was different: in the CNT, which consists of IC cells and CNT cells, 97.3% (36/37) of IC cells were of the beta type. In the CCD, which consists of IC cells and CD cells, 79.8% (79/99) of IC cells were of the beta-type, whereas in the OMCDi 100% (19/19) were of the alpha type, suggesting that the beta type predominates in the earlier and the alpha type in the later segment.\r"

  ".W": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines are distinguished from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines by their growth in floating aggregates, in contrast to the adherent monolayers formed by NSCLC cells in culture. Of 50 well-characterized SCLC lines recently described by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, only four variant cell lines (SCLC-v) grew as adherent monolayers. One line, NCI-H446, was unique in growing long-term with coexisting floating and surface adherent subpopulations. We have physically segregated these two populations over many passages in vitro to enrich for relatively pure cultures of floating and adherent cells. No differences in c-myc expression, keratin pattern, or cytogenetic appearance were found between the adherent and floating sublines. However, expression of the neuroendocrine marker neuron-specific enolase in the floating cells was three times that found in the adherent cells. The floating subline also had much greater surface expression of neuroendocrine tumor antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies UJ13A and HNK-1, which have been recently shown to detect the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) on SCLC cells. Two other adherent SCLC-v lines were also found to be unreactive with UJ13A and HNK-1, generalizing the association between NCAM expression and the growth of most SCLC cultures as floating aggregates. In conclusion, we have an interesting model to study expression of NCAM as related to the adhesive properties of SCLC cells.\r"

To determine if this contraction-induced reflex is modulated by the sinoaortic baroreflex, we performed microelectrode recordings of sympathetic nerve activity to resting leg muscle during static handgrip in humans while attempting to clamp the level of baroreflex stimulation by controlling the exercise-induced rise in blood pressure with pharmacologic agents. The principal new finding is that partial pharmacologic suppression of the rise in blood pressure during static handgrip (nitroprusside infusion) augmented the exercise-induced increases in heart rate and sympathetic activity by greater than 300%. Pharmacologic accentuation of the exercise-induced rise in blood pressure (phenylephrine infusion) attenuated these reflex increases by greater than 50%. In contrast, these pharmacologic manipulations in arterial pressure had little or no effect on: (a) forearm muscle cell pH, an index of the metabolic stimulus to skeletal muscle afferents; or (b) central venous pressure, an index of the mechanical stimulus to cardiopulmonary afferents. We conclude that in humans the sinoaortic baroreflex is much more effective than previously thought in buffering the reflex sympathetic activation caused by static muscle contraction.\r"

The fractional catabolic rate of 68 (19)% of the plasma pool per day was more rapid than other reported human plasma proteins. All radioactivity was excreted in the urine by 14 d. In 16 patients with monoclonal gammopathy or chronic inflammatory diseases, but without amyloidosis, 125I-SAP metabolism was normal. However, among 45 patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis (25, amyloid A type; 20, amyloid L type), 125I-SAP was cleared from the plasma more rapidly, accumulated in the amyloid deposits, and persisted there. The T1/2 in amyloid, measured directly with 131I-SAP, was 24 d. Repeat studies after 6-18 mo were notably consistent in normals but changed significantly in amyloid patients, generally correlating with clinical signs of disease progression. Measurements of 125I-SAP turnover may thus be of value for diagnosis and monitoring of amyloidosis. Analysis of SAP metabolism in amyloidosis suggests that plasma SAP is in dynamic equilibrium with a very large amyloid pool, and in two autopsies the total mass of SAP in the amyloid deposits was 2,100 and 21,000 mg, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-CD2-induced T cell proliferation was analyzed in the peripheral blood samples of 31 primary and 8 secondary untreated Sjogren's syndrome patients. Anti-CD2-stimulated PBMC proliferation was very low in about one-third of primary Sjogren's syndrome samples, despite the number of CD2+ cells being similar in primary and secondary Sjogren's syndrome and normal PBMC samples. The depressed response to anti-CD2 was mainly found in anti-Ro+/La+ patients. Experiments on purified T cells demonstrated that a defect at the T cell level was responsible for the anti-CD2 unresponsiveness. Cell proliferation failure was associated with poor IL-2 and IL-2 receptor mRNA expression and, consequently, IL-2 and IL-2 receptor synthesis. Since defective anti-CD2-induced mitogenesis could be reversed by phorbol myristate acetate, but not calcium ionophore A23187, it is probably correlated with impaired protein kinase C activation. Comparison of anti-CD2-triggered PBMC proliferation in treated and untreated patients and a long-term study of nine patients showed that the defect is a stable characteristic in primary Sjogren's syndrome patients, but that it can be reversed by pharmacological immunosuppression.\r"

Some rare deficiency alleles of alpha 1AT produce low but detectable amounts of plasma alpha 1AT (1-20% of normal), which can be differentiated by isoelectric focusing. Others, designated null (QO) alleles, produce no alpha 1AT detectable by routine quantitative methods. We have previously described a method using DNA polymorphisms, haplotypes, and polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing gels, to differentiate various deficiency alleles. Based on haplotypes, we previously identified, in eight patients, five different null alleles, four of which had been previously sequenced. We have now analyzed all 12 null alleles in these eight patients, using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, and have identified six different null alleles. We have cloned and sequenced one of these, PI*QOludwigshafen, which has a base substitution in exon II, replacing isoleucine 92 in the normal sequence with an asparagine. This substitution of a polar for a nonpolar amino acid occurs in one of the alpha-helices and is predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure. A total of 13 different alpha 1AT deficiency alleles, 6 of them null alleles, have been sequenced to date.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) has been reported to stimulate activities of acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase (ACEH; EC 3.1.1.13) and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NCEH; EC 3.1.1.13) in the smooth muscle cells leading to a decrease in intracellular cholesteryl ester. Recently, we have found that the half-life of PGI2 was prolonged through stabilization by HDL. HDL is known to have anti-atherogenic properties, although its precise mechanism has not been fully clarified. We therefore hypothesized that HDL can exert anti-atherogenic action by augmenting PGI2-stimulated increases in the activities of ACEH and NCEH. After incubation with PGI2 and HDL, a cell homogenate was made from which the activities of ACEH and NCEH were assessed. HDL significantly augmented the PGI2-induced increase in the activities of both enzymes. This effect of HDL was abolished in the absence of PGI2. Elevated intracellular levels of cyclic AMP were maintained for longer periods by HDL. The increase in both intracellular cyclic AMP levels and enzyme activities disappeared in the presence of an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine. Radiolabeled smooth muscle cells demonstrated a significant loss in total cholesterol and cholesteryl ester after treatment with PGI2 and HDL, due to the increase in cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activities. These data suggest that HDL enhanced the PGI2-stimulated hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester and augmented the PGI2-induced reduction of cellular cholesteryl ester content by stabilizing PGI2.\r"

  ".W": "We studied cellular processes activated by prostaglandins (PG) that are involved in the protection of gastric chief cell injury estimated in terms of dye exclusion test, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or 51Cr from prelabeled chief cells. Pretreatment of chief cells with 3 x 10(-6) M PGE2 or PGE1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 for 15 min maximally reduced not only ethanol- but also taurocholic acid-caused LDH release from chief cells. PGs equipotently stimulated increases in the accumulation of diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP without elevating intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in gastric chief cells. The rank order of the potency was equal to that of PGs to reduce the injury. Pretreatment of chief cells with synthetic 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) or 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) reduced the injury of chief cells, while 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, an inactive phorbol ester, failed to reduce the injury and 1-(5-isouinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) blocked the protective action of PGE2. On the other hand, forskolin and dbcAMP had no effect on ethanol-caused LDH release and diacylglycerol formation in chief cells. These results suggest that PGE2 and PGE1 possess the direct protective action against ethanol- or taurocholic acid-caused injury in chief cells, presumably through the activation of the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C signaling pathway.\r"
