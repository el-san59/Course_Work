These diseases were classified according to their interrelations and distinct meteorologic patterns into two groups: (1) acute asthma and acute laryngitis, which are correlated with the afternoon gradients of air temperature, heat content (the thermal energy of the ambient air), and modified heat content factor (the energy required to heat the air water vapor to the ambient temperature), but not correlated with the absolute values of air temperature and water content: and (2), bronchopneumonia/pneumonia and upper respiratory infections, which are correlated only with the absolute values of the meteorologic parameters (air temperature, water content, heat content, and modified heat content factor), but not with their afternoon gradients. Admissions for bronchiolitis revealed an age-related pattern: up to 1 yr they resembled Group 2 and from 1 to 2 yr, Group 1. It follows that the admission rates of acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in childhood are linked both to the afternoon weather gradients and to some of the acute respiratory infections.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial reactivity to inhaled methacholine was measured by the steady-state tidal breathing method in asthmatic children aged 1 to 17 yr. The children were divided into three clinical groups according to their minimal therapeutic requirements: mild asthma, children requiring infrequent treatment with inhaled beta-agonists (81 patients); moderate asthma, children requiring daily preventive treatment with either cromolyn sodium or slow-release theophylline (67 patients); and severe asthma, children requiring daily preventive treatment with oral or inhaled steroids (34 patients). They were also divided into three age groups: from 1 to 6 yr, tested by using bronchial provocation with tracheal auscultation (BPTA) to determine the methacholine concentration causing wheezing (PCW); and from 7 to 11 yr and 12 to 17 yr, using lung function testing to determine the concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). For the whole group the mean level of bronchial reactivity to methacholine correlated inversely with the severity of bronchial asthma according to the minimal drug requirements (p less than 0.0001) and was similar over the whole age range (p less than 0.9965) for each severity grouping. In the older children the difference between moderate and severe asthma was not significant, but this may have been a result of the effect of corticosteroids in the severe group. We concluded that age has no significant effect on the methacholine response in asthmatic children over a wide age range.\r"

We studied a heterogeneous group of patients with stable asthma (mean +/- SEM age, 46 +/- 4 yr) for four visits at weekly intervals. Predictor variables were determined at the first visit. Nine independent physiologic variables were obtained at each minute during exercise; the Borg rating of breathlessness (range 0 to 10) was used as the dependent variable. The regression model relating the physiologic parameters to the Borg rating of breathlessness was highly significant (model F = 43.4; p = 0.0001). Backward elimination selected the strongest predictors of the Borg rating: peak inspiratory flow (VI); tidal volume (VT)/FVC; frequency of respiration (f); and peak inspiratory mouth pressures (Pm). These four variables explained 63% of the variance in the rating of dyspnea. Each of the four variables exhibited a linear relationship with the Borg rating. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing results at the first and second visits. Individual slopes (except for VT/FVC) and intercepts for the four predictor variables versus Borg ratings were highly reliable. The slope for work intensity (watts) and Borg ratings, but not the intercept, was highly reliable. Responsiveness was evaluated by randomly administering inhaled methacholine or inhaled metaproterenol, alternately, at the third and fourth visits to induce acute changes in lung function before exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients breathed either warm or cold air for 10 min before 30-s challenges with doubling concentrations of aerosolized histamine that were nebulized while the subject breathed warm air. Before histamine inhalation minute ventilation (VI) was 8.41 +/- 1.38 L/min breathing warm air and 7.86 +/- 0.97 L/min breathing cold air. Respiratory heat exchange (RHE) was 0.25 +/- 0.05 kcal/min with warm air and 0.24 +/- 0.03 kcal/min with cold air. The PC20 obtained following cold air breathing (0.48 +/- 4.63 mg/ml) was lower than that following warm air breathing (0.85 +/- 4.60 mg/ml; p less than 0.02). We conclude that breathing cold air increases the bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine in asthmatic patients.\r"

To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with 57 individuals from whom CMV was not isolated, the 54 individuals from whom CMV were isolated did not differ in baseline characteristics, long-term survival (213 versus 275 days, p = 0.97), acute death rate (19% in both, p = 1.0), or length of hospital stay (19.7 versus 21.1 days, p = 0.68). Also, the time to develop CMV cytopathology in culture did not correlate with acute or long-term survival. Our observations thus do not support the use of CMV-specific antiviral therapy in AIDS patients with P. carinii pneumonia who also have evidence of pulmonary CMV infection.\r"

Cylindrical proximal and distal bronchi and midtracheal strips were excised and mounted on an isometric force transducer in a physiologic tissue bath. Dose-response curves to the muscarinic agonist bethanechol (BCh) alone were compared with responses to BCh plus U46619. Airways were incubated for 2 h prior to and during second BCh curves with a noncontractile dose of U46619. U46619 induced a left shift of the dose-response curve in all airways. This was significant only at the ED10 level in trachealis, and at the ED10, ED20, and ED50 levels in large and small bronchi. Muscarinic hyperresponsiveness induced by U46619 was significantly greater in small airways than in large bronchi or trachealis. Stabilization of endogenously released acetylcholine (ACh) with physostigmine did not alter the responses to BCh plus U46619; therefore, this mechanism does not fully explain the induction of hyperresponsiveness by U46619. Our findings demonstrate the induction of a graded increase in muscarinic responsiveness in isolated airways, and they suggest that results of studies of trachealis or proximal bronchi may not necessarily be generalized to the distal resistance airways.\r"

Airway segments were isolated 48 h after aerosol challenge with either saline or RAg, and airway contractile responses to histamine were measured. Histamine remained a weak agonist in TSM segments after RAg challenge. In contrast, BSM responsivity to histamine was significantly increased after RAg challenge as evidenced by a parallel shift to the left (i.e., Fslope = 3.2; degrees of freedom (df) = 1,224; p = NS and Felev = 19.4; df = 1,225; p less than 0.001) of the mean dose-response relationship. In sham-immunized rabbits, the BSM contractile responses to histamine were similar after aerosol challenge with either RAg or normal saline. After the BSM segments were treated with 10(-6) M atropine, there was no significant difference in histamine reactivity between the RAg- and saline-challenged groups. The augmented BSM contractile response to histamine was only partially inhibited in the presence of either tetrodotoxin or hexamethonium. We conclude that 48 h after a single in vivo exposure to antigen in immune rabbits, the airway contractile responses to histamine in vitro are increased in BSM but not in TSM and that the mechanism of the augmented contractile responses in BSM likely involves the facilitated neural release of acetylcholine from both preganglionic and postganglionic sites.\r"

Twelve adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with a naturally occurring respiratory sensitivity to inhaled Ascaris suum extract were anesthetized and intubated for each study. Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and dynamic lung compliance (CLdyn) were measured before and after antigen inhalation, and the release of mediators into the airways was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). BAL samples were concentrated approximately 5-fold before quantitation of LTC4 and PGD2 by RP-HPLC and radioimmunoassay and histamine by a fluorometric assay. Antigen inhalation resulted in a 40-fold increase in BAL levels of i-LTC4 (1.5 +/- 0.7 to 41.6 +/- 12.7 ng, p less than 0.01), a 10-fold increase in i-PGD2 (2.4 +/- 0.9 to 25.9 +/- 5.5 ng, p less than 0.01), and a 20-fold increase in BAL histamine (1.0 +/- 1.5 to 21.4 +/- 2.3 micrograms, p less than 0.01). Dexamethasone (n = 7) inhibited the antigen-induced increase in BAL i-LTC4 (71 +/- 6%, p less than 0.01) and i-PGD2 (52 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05) while weakly inhibiting histamine release (43 +/- 10%). Indomethacin (n = 7) had a variable effect on i-LTC4 levels (6 +/- 51%), strongly inhibited i-PGD2 (88 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01), and had no effect on histamine release (25 +/- 8%). Pretreatment with iodoxamide tromethamine significantly blocked the release of each mediator, but mepyramine, an H1 antagonist, had no effect on mediator release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During spontaneous breathing, the mean work of breathing diminished significantly after albuterol, from 9.35 +/- 1.05 to 8.33 +/- 1.13 J/min (p less than 0.01), and seven patients exhibited a decrease superior or equal to 15%. This decrease resulted from a marked reduction in lung and airway resistance, from 12.0 +/- 1.7 to 9.8 +/- 1.4 cm H2O.L-1.s (p less than 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the breathing pattern, intrinsic PEEP or arterial blood gas measurements after albuterol, and peripheral cardiovascular effects were not significant. In seven patients, we were able to compare the changes that occurred after albuterol in the work of breathing during weaning from mechanical ventilation with the changes in pulmonary function induced by albuterol after extubation, as assessed by the forced oscillation method. A close correlation was found between the two types of change, further indicating that the reduction in the work of breathing was more likely to occur in patients with the largest bronchodilating effect of albuterol at baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, vision worsened again within two weeks of discontinuation of the treatment. On resumption of acetazolamide therapy for three weeks, and its slow withdrawal during the following three weeks, the macular edema eventually resolved, and vision returned to normal. Our observation provides a direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy and shows the importance of tapering the doses of this regimen.\r"

Both eyes developed granulomatous panuveitis, which partially responded to medical treatment.

A pathologic examination of material from the anterior chamber and vitreous showed lymphocytes, histiocytes, and pigment cells contributing to the diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an intraocular lens implicated as a cause of sympathetic ophthalmia.\r"

Although no significant differences were found between the two groups, the high percentage of patients in both groups (42.9% and 37.3%) with severe diabetic retinopathy at the time of initial presentation suggests that earlier patient referral from primary-care physicians and better patient education about the need for earlier eye examinations should be encouraged in these two groups.\r"

Five aneuploid lesions and 24 diploid lesions were identified. All aneuploid lesions occurred in radioresistant tumors. The probability of an aneuploid tumor failing radiotherapy was highly significant at p = .016. No DNA discordance was found in a sampling of half of the radioresistant lesions' pretreatment and recurrent specimens, for a 100% predictive value of moderate statistical power. On the basis of these findings, patients with aneuploid T1 glottic lesions should be referred for primary surgical therapy.\r"

Six patients fitted with the UCSF/Storz cochlear implant device were studied. The effects of use of the implant device on tinnitus were monitored, and suppression of tinnitus was tracked throughout periods of stimulation and poststimulation. Tinnitus was effectively suppressed in five of six patients with the device on and with noise input, and reduction of perceived tinnitus loudness occurred in four of six with the device on but without acoustic input to the speech processor. Unilateral stimulation frequently resulted in bilateral tinnitus suppression. These studies reveal that profound tinnitus suppression is obtained by patients using their cochlear implants. Further work is required to quantify the optimal mode of stimulation, but these findings suggest that tinnitus sufferers may ultimately benefit from development of electrical stimulation tinnitus suppression devices.\r"

This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia. An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy.\r"

A retrospective study was performed on 45 tonsillectomies for PTA in military personnel from December 1986 through December 1988. Twenty-three quinsy (abscess) tonsillectomies and 22 interval tonsillectomies were identified. Parameters studied were age, sex, abscess location, interval prior to operation, blood loss, operative time, operative experience, and combined hospital and convalescent days for the two groups. Significant differences were noted between the quinsy and interval tonsillectomy groups concerning the average number of days hospitalized (3.0 versus 4.5) and their respective convalescent periods (10.3 versus 17.3). We conclude that quinsy tonsillectomy is the best management for PTA in a young work force when the optimal treatment choice is between interval or acute tonsillectomy.\r"

To determine the source of lysozyme during the early period of acute pneumococcal otitis media, chinchillas were irradiated to induce neutropenia, and their middle ears were inoculated with heat-killed, encapsulated pneumococci. The number of inflammatory cells and concentration of lysozyme were measured in MEF between 6 and 72 hours after inoculation. In pneumococcus-inoculated ears, the mean number of inflammatory cells but not lysozyme was significantly lower in MEF from irradiated animals than that from nonirradiated animals at 6 hours. Since lysozyme accumulated in MEF before the influx of inflammatory cells in irradiated animals, the initial release of this inflammatory mediator is most likely not from inflammatory cells; and mucosal epithelial cells, the only other known source of lysozyme in the middle ear environment, were the probable source induced by the direct stimulation of pneumococci. Inflammatory cells may contribute lysozyme later in the inflammatory response, since cellular and lysozyme concentrations in irradiated and nonirradiated animals were similar between 24 and 72 hours. These results suggest that future therapeutic interventions to limit middle ear inflammation in acute otitis media may need to recognize the direct action of pneumococcal cells or their envelope components on middle ear epithelium.\r"

DNA sequencing, in addition, was performed in 4 cases. No point mutation was detected in codon 12 of c-K-ras in the 42 squamous cell carcinomas we examined. According to the results of DNA sequencing of 4 cases, codon 13 also revealed no point mutation. Thus, point mutational activation of codon 12 of c-K-ras oncogene is an uncommon event in human upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy.\r"

The regular reflectance contains the visual cues related to surface texture, whereas the backscattered component contains the cues related to pigmentation, erythema, infiltrates, vessels, and other intracutaneous structures. Unlike the backscattered component, regular reflectance preserves the plane of polarization of polarized incident light. Thus, viewing skin through a linear polarizer, under linearly polarized illumination, separates the two components of tissue reflectance. Thirty patients were examined and photographed in this manner. When the planes of polarization are parallel, images with enhanced surface detail are obtained. When the planes are orthogonal, wrinkles and surface detail disappear, and an enhanced view of vasculature and pigmented lesions is obtained. Simple, clinically useful techniques are presented.\r"

The data from the study revealed a bright continuous band of immunofluorescence (IF) along the dermoepidermal junction in 10 (20%) of 50 sun-exposed skin biopsy specimens, as compared with none from non-sun-exposed skin biopsy specimens with the use of polyvalent antisera. Fractionated monospecific immunoglobulin demonstrated a bright continuous band of IF composed of IgG alone in one patient, IgA alone in two patients, IgG and IgA in combination in two patients, and the combination of IgG, IgM, and IgA in five patients. There was a statistically significant increase in positive IF in men (seven of 15) vs women (three of 35). This information suggests that in the examination of a patient suspected of having lesions of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, positive IF from sun-exposed skin is nonspecific and adds little information to the clinical and histopathologic findings.\r"

These patients with necrosis were age and gender matched with 176 controls randomly selected from the remaining 872 patients. Current high-level smokers, that is those smoking one or more packs per day, had necrosis develop approximately three times more frequently than never smokers, low-level smokers (less than one pack per day), or former smokers (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.2). Former smokers (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 3.2) and low-level smokers (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.1) were at a negligible increased risk for necrosis that was not significantly different from never smokers. Once tissue necrosis developed, the median percent of the visible flap or graft tissue that necrosed was approximately threefold greater among current smokers (regardless of the number of packs per day smoked) than never smokers.\r"

Control dilutions of irritants alone were applied. Responses were measured objectively at 72 hours. The response to both allergen and irritant was greater than to either alone. Doses of allergen, which did not produce a response when applied alone, produced a response when an irritant was added. Irritants therefore increase the allergic contact dermatitis response and may explain the presence of contact dermatitis in patients with negative patch tests.\r"

After 6 months of therapy, the three nails treated with active solution showed marked clinical improvement and a corresponding increase in nail growth rates. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone produced a small increase in nail growth rate and slight clinical improvement. Active solution was then applied to all of the nails for a further 6 months, resulting in clinical improvement and increased nail growth rates in the remaining nails. These beneficial effects require further study.\r"

These infections, which clinically mimic those caused by dermatophytes but are caused by nondermatophyte agents, are correctly called dermatomycoses. When examined microscopically with potassium hydroxide, the agents of these disorders resemble those of dermatophytosis, showing narrow, septate, branching hyphae. It, therefore, becomes important to culture samples taken from sites with these tineas on cycloheximide-free agars even if they are potassium hydroxide-positive to rule out nondermatophyte mycoses. Correct identification becomes imperative since neither H toruloidea nor S hyalinum responds to conventional therapy. We review these diseases with emphasis on clinical appearance and differentiation from dermatophytosis. We also report four cases of S hyalinum infection of the nail or feet.\r"

One hundred five newly diagnosed incident melanoma cases with negative family histories for familial melanoma and 181 controls (frequency matched for race, age, and sex) were studied by personal interview and cutaneous examination. The prevalence of dysplastic nevi was 41 (39%) of 105 in the cases and 13 (7%) of 181 in the controls. The odds ratio for dysplastic nevi by multiple logistic regression analysis simultaneously correcting for age, sex, eye color, hair color, actinic damage, freckles, and total number of nondysplastic nevi was 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.7, 16.9). This study supports the significance of dysplastic nevi as markers of increased risk for nonfamilial melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "Rectal adenocarcinoma is said to have a poorer outcome than colon adenocarcinoma when compared on the basis of Dukes' staging. However a new staging system, determined by a multivariate analysis of 147 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, has revealed three other variables significantly related to outcome. Therefore this study analyzed the authors' experience with colonic carcinoma during the same time period as they had studied for rectal carcinoma to determine whether the new staging system is valid for colon carcinoma as well, and, if so, to compare the outcome of patients with colon and rectal carcinoma on the basis of this new staging. A total of 603 patients with 611 colonic adenocarcinoma were operated on at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 1965 and 1981. Two hundred seventy-nine adenocarcinomas (45.7%) were located proximal to the splenic flexure and 332 (54.3%) were located between the splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid. Four hundred sixty-two patients underwent segmental colectomy, 46 subtotal colectomy, 26 total colectomy, 18 proctocolectomy, 5 abdominal-perineal resection, 1 appendectomy, while 20 had local excision of the tumor through colotomy and 25 had permanent diverting stoma as the only procedure. The operative mortality rate was 6.1% in the whole group, but was only 2.7% in the group of potentially curable patients. Complete follow-up was obtained in all patients. To validate a previous staging system for Dukes' B and C rectal adenocarcinoma, the authors investigated the correlation between 5-year survival for colonic carcinoma patients and all relevant variables that they had considered potentially meaningful in the previous study with rectal adenocarcinoma. The resulting multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that the four variables found previously to be significantly related to outcome for rectal adenocarcinoma patients (stage, race, tumor morphology, and vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion) were the only four variables significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with outcome for colonic adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, by using the results of their previous staging system for rectal adenocarcinoma patients, they 'predicted' the 5-year survival rates of the colon adenocarcinoma patients, divided in 16 staging subgroups. In subgroups of at least 15 patients, the rectal staging system predicted the outcome to within 1 to 6 percentage points of the observed outcome of the colonic adenocarcinoma patients. Thus this study validates this staging system, incorporating stage, race, tumor morphology, and microinvasion to predict 5-year survival rate more accurately than Dukes' staging alone for both colon and rectal adenocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Teaching hospitals were more likely than NTHs to have a separate surgical ICU (92% versus 37%), a dedicated ICU service/physician (37% versus 7%), and a surgeon as director of the ICU (67% versus 29%). All THs and 33% of NTHs provided 24 hour in-house coverage for the ICU. A majority of respondents preferred a surgeon as ICU director (TH, 85%; NTH, 67%) and felt that critical care was an essential part of surgery (THs, 87%; NTHs, 74%). Most (THs, 58%; NTHs, 56%) thought that a cooperative effort between the primary service and an ICU service provided better patient care, but only 37% of THs and 22% of NTHs provided care with such a system. Many (THs, 45%; NTHs, 33%) thought that surgeons are willingly relinquishing ICU care. Surgeons continue to desire responsibility for their patients in the ICU and most prefer ICU service involvement provided by surgeons. This discrepancy between what is practiced and what is desired, along with proposed changes in reimbursement for surgery and the recent definition of critical care as an essential part of surgery, may stimulate greater involvement of surgeons in critical care.\r"

An open biopsy is required to establish diagnosis definitively. Despite improved imaging techniques and preoperative and intraoperative patient management, resectability has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. Even with an aggressive operative approach, only one half the tumors can be resected completely, and of those, more than 90% recur locally and result in the death of the patient. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy has not altered this pattern of local failure, in contrast to promising results with extremity soft-tissue sarcoma. Because of the rarity of these tumors, there is an urgent need to establish a national retroperitoneal sarcoma registry and to form cooperative intergroup studies to evaluate, treat, and apply innovative multimodality combination therapies to these otherwise lethal tumors.\r"

To evaluate continued intestinal ischemia in the ongoing BT associated with sepsis after injury, rats were randomized to (1) 30% burn injury with Pseudomonas wound infection (BI), (2) BI + fluid resuscitation (BI + Fluid), (3) BI after allopurinol pretreatment to inhibit xanthine oxidase (BI + Allo), or (4) BI after azapropazone pretreatment to inhibit neutrophil degranulation (BI + Aza). On postburn days (PBD) 1, 4, and 7, animals were studied for evidence of BT and intestinal lipid peroxidation. BI + Fluid, BI + Allo, and BI + Aza significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced rates of BT and ileal lipid peroxidation acutely after thermal injury (PBD 1) compared to BI. All four groups had equally high rates of BT associated with the onset of sepsis (PBDs 4 and 7), without evidence of further intestinal lipid peroxidation. These data indicate that the chronic gut barrier failure associated with sepsis after injury occurs independently of continued intestinal ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine has been used as primary immunosuppression in renal allograft recipients in our unit for the past decade. The overall clinical experience and long-term effects of the agent are reviewed. There were 461 consecutive recipients of kidney grafts; 379 received grafts from cadaver donors (CAD) and 82 from living related donors (LRD). Four separate clinical protocols were used sequentially using progressively decreasing doses of CyA; azathioprine was added in group 4 recipients of LRD grafts, and in patients receiving secondary CAD grafts (group 5). The patient mortality rate was less than 5%, with sepsis being the prime contributor. The majority of kidney grafts were lost within the first 2 months after operation; those that never functioned were found almost invariably to have been irreversibly rejected. During the subsequent years of follow-up, attrition of CAD grafts was significantly greater than LRD grafts. In contrast, the attrition rate of primary and secondary CAD grafts was the same after the first 3 months, emphasizing the importance of early immunologic graft destruction. Primary nonfunction occurred in 49% of CAD kidneys and 17% of LRD grafts; however 71% of initially nonfunctioning LRD grafts never functioned at all compared to 34% of CAD grafts, the majority of such organs undergoing fulminate rejection. Individual graft loss after 1 year was almost inevitably due to chronic rejection; there were no differences in long-term allograft function among the treatment groups. Although CyA has improved overall results of kidney transplantation, chronic rejection remains a major unresolved problem.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results.\r"

Six unoperated patients, 4 men and 2 women, were studied as control subjects. Basal plasma levels of gastrin were significantly higher in controls than in patients who had a standard PD (p less than 0.05) and gastrin responses to a meal were also blunted in these patients. In contrast basal and postprandial levels of gastrin after PPPD were significantly higher than these found in patients with standard PD (p less than 0.05). Postprandial gastrin response after PPPD were similar in pattern to these found in controls. Integrated gastrin release after PPPD was less than that of the control but was significantly greater than that in patients with standard PD. Basal plasma levels of CCK in the patients after the standard PD were significantly lower than in controls and significantly higher postprandial levels of CCK were found after PPPD compared to standard PD (p less than 0.05). However integrated CCK from 0 to 120 minutes were not significantly different between PPPD and standard PD groups. Based on these observations concerning hormonal release of gastrin and CCK, preservation of the stomach and the duodenal bulb appears to be a more physiologic reconstructive procedure than the standard PD. In addition the operation probably has more beneficial effect on the injured pancreas in time.\r"

Endotoxin challenge (1 mg/kg) in adult dogs caused a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular +/- dP/dt max, and regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres). Cardiocirculatory dysfunction and acid-base derangements persisted throughout the experimental period in untreated endotoxin shock (group 1, n = 10). In contrast both regimens of fluid resuscitation (group 2, n = 11: bolus of 4 mL/kg HSD followed by a constant infusion of lactated Ringer's [LR] to maintain MABP and CO at baseline values; group 3, n = 10; LR alone given as described for group 2) improved regional perfusion and corrected acid-base disturbances similarly in all dogs. Hypertonic saline dextran enhanced all indices of cardiac contraction and relaxation more than LR alone. The total volume of LR required to maintain MABP and CO at baseline values was less in the HSD group (59.2 +/- 6.8 mL/kg) than in the LR alone group (158 +/- 16 mL/kg, p = 0.01). The net fluid gain (infused volume minus urine output and normalized for kilogram body weight) was five times greater in the LR (24.8 +/- 6.2 mL/kg) than in the HSD group (4.6 +/- 1.2 mL/kg, p = 0.01). Lung water was similar in all dogs, regardless of the regimen of fluid resuscitation. Hypertonic saline dextran effectively resuscitates endotoxin shock in this canine model.\r"

  ".W": "The skin is commonly affected in the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In many cases, skin findings may be the earliest sign of HIV disease or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. When cutaneous diseases occur in unusual settings, such as zoster in a young individual, are increased in severity or fail to respond to routine therapy, the possibility of underlying immunodeficiency should be suspected. Skin diseases in HIV-infected hosts include primary infections, such as those caused by herpes simplex virus and molluscum contagiosum, as well as secondary involvement of systemic diseases, such as cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. Noninfectious inflammatory processes, such as seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis, as well as neoplasms, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma, may all be seen in these patients. We review a number of these diseases and discuss their treatment. Clinicians must be aware of the cutaneous manifestations of HIV infection so that the disease will be recognized at an earlier point in time and therapy with zidovudine and prophylactic antibiotics will be instituted where appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the literature regarding central nervous system side effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) revealed three general categories: aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Aseptic meningitis is found most commonly in patients with lupus treated with ibuprofen, but it should be considered in any patient with meningitis if the patient has used NSAIDs. Psychosis, although infrequently reported with NSAIDs, should be suspected in an elderly patient started on a regimen of indomethacin who acutely develops disorientation, paranoia, or hallucinations. Finally, there appears to be some potential for memory dysfunction and attention deficits in elderly patients treated with NSAIDs. Until further studies are available on the incidence and severity of these cognitive changes, physicians should use low doses of NSAIDs in the elderly and remain alert to the possibility of such adverse side effects.\r"

Clinically recognizable nervous system involvement occurs in about 10% of patients with sarcoidosis, although the incidence of subclinical neurosarcoidosis is much higher. The disease appears in the differential diagnosis of many infectious and noninfectious neurological syndromes. We have reviewed all aspects of neurosarcoidosis from the point of view of practicing internists, including the clinical manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid and radiographic changes, differential diagnosis, and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of US Peace Corps volunteers (PCVs) serving in Zaire, central Africa, was undertaken to determine the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus infection in an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-aware expatriate population living in an area of high endemicity for both diseases. Of the 338 PCVs who served in Zaire between October 1985 and May 1988, 282 (83%) were enrolled, representing 7776 volunteer-months of service. Analyses of serum samples for HIV and hepatitis B virus were performed on enrollment and at completion of service. All PCVs received extensive education and counseling regarding HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome throughout their stay in Zaire. There were no documented seroconversions to HIV among 282 PCVs who lived in Zaire for periods ranging from 1 to 81 months, with a mean length of stay of 27.4 months. Of the 14 (6.2%) of 226 PCVs tested who had at least one positive serologic marker for infection with hepatitis B virus, none was documented to have seroconverted during service. During the study period, the rate of all sexually transmitted diseases among PCVs in Africa decreased from 131 to 68 per 1000 study population per year, and there were 52 cases of confirmed malaria among volunteers in Zaire. These data suggest that the risk of acquiring infection with HIV or hepatitis B virus in PCVs in Zaire is very low, and there is no evidence for unusual modes of transmission.\r"

Thirty-six diabetic subjects were randomly assigned to a standard behavior therapy program or to a behavior therapy program that included an 8-week period of VLCD. The behavior therapy group consumed a balanced diet of 4200 to 6300 J/d throughout the 20-week program. The VLCD group consumed a balanced diet of 4200 to 6300 J for weeks 1 to 4, followed by a VLCD (1680 J/d of lean meat, fish, and fowl) for weeks 5 to 12. The VLCD group then gradually reintroduced other foods during weeks 13 to 16 and consumed a balanced diet of 4200 to 6300 J/d for weeks 17 to 20. Thirty-three of the 36 subjects completed the 20-week program and the 1-year follow-up. Use of the VLCD produced greater decreases in fasting glucose at the end of the 20-week program and at 1-year follow-up and greater long-term reductions in HbA1. The VLCD group also had greater weight losses at week 20, but weight losses from pretreatment to 1-year follow-up were similar in the two treatment groups. The improved glycemic control with the VLCD appeared to be due to increased insulin secretion, but further research is needed to confirm this.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic data on the incidence of gross proteinuria in people with diabetes are important in medical counseling, in projecting estimates of needs and costs of health care, and for developing approaches to prevent renal complications. We performed a population-based incidence study in southern Wisconsin of insulin-taking diabetic persons diagnosed before 30 years of age. The presence of gross proteinuria (greater than or equal to 0.30 g/L) was determined by means of a reagent strip. The incidence of proteinuria in a 4-year interval was 14.4% (95% confidence interval, 11.7% to 17.0%). The relative risk of developing proteinuria after 4 years for those with glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 5.3). The incidence of proteinuria was also associated with higher diastolic blood pressure, being male, taking more insulin, and having more severe retinopathy at the baseline examination. The relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin level and the incidence of proteinuria was significant even after controlling for these other risk variables. These data suggest that hyperglycemia, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin level, is a significant risk factor for the development of gross proteinuria.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE. To determine whether the high mortality among diabetic patients receiving treatment for hypertension can be explained by associated risk factors or must be attributed to a deleterious effect of antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN. Cohort analytic study with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. SETTING. Outpatients with diabetes and severe retinopathy who were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of laser treatment to prevent blindness had ophthalmologic examinations every 4 months and annual medical examinations that included measurement of blood pressure and recording of anti-hypertensive treatment. Only 5.5% of the patients were unavailable for follow-up. When a patient died, the circumstances surrounding the death were reviewed and classified by a mortality review committee. PARTICIPANTS.--There were 759 participants in the study; they were white, were aged 35 to 69 years, and had normal serum creatinine levels at the baseline examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS.--Patients were classified into five groups according to information recorded at the baseline and first annual follow-up examinations: normotensive (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), untreated hypertensive, hypertensive treated by diuretics alone, hypertensive treated by other agents alone, and hypertensive treated by both agents. Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients treated for hypertension than in patients with untreated hypertension. The excess was primarily found in patients treated with diuretics alone, although that group had the lowest blood pressure with treatment. After adjusting for differences in risk factors, cardiovascular mortality was 3.8 times higher in patients treated with diuretics alone than in patients with untreated hypertension (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS.--In individuals with diabetes, intervention with diuretics to reduce hypertension is associated with excess mortality. Until there is a clinical trial showing a beneficial effect of diuretic treatment in diabetic patients, there is urgent need to reconsider its continued usage in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Prospectively collected data on the incidence of treated hypertensive end-stage renal disease (HT-ESRD) were analyzed to investigate whether the higher rate of HT-ESRD in blacks compared with whites is due to differences in putative ESRD risk factors. The overall age-adjusted relative risks of HT-ESRD for black compared with white residents in the Maryland Regional ESRD Registry (Network 31) Catchment Area were 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 9.4) and 9.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 13.1) for men and women, respectively. In a population level analysis, race-specific HT-ESRD incidence rates in the black and white populations of 13 regions in Network 31 were related to the prevalence of putative ESRD risk factors in those populations. The latter were estimated from the 1981-1982 Maryland Statewide Household Hypertension Survey. Black populations had a 5.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 8.1) higher unadjusted incidence of HT-ESRD than white populations. The HT-ESRD incidence in a population was also directly related to that population's prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, and diabetes mellitus and inversely related to measures of socioeconomic status and mean age at diagnosis of hypertension. When adjusted simultaneously for age, prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, diabetes, and level of education, the risk of HT-ESRD was still 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 6.2) times higher for black compared with white populations. Our findings failed to support the hypothesis that race-related differences in the prevalence, severity, or age at onset of hypertension, in the prevalence of diabetes or in socioeconomic status, explain the well-recognized black-white differences in the HT-ESRD incidence.\r"

In sum, QRS duration is an unimportant predictor of coronary disease in this Framingham population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND.--The purpose of this study is a prospective assessment of morphine sulfate administration by intermittent intravenous (IV) injections (Int-IV) vs patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients in the emergency department (ED) with sickle cell crisis pain. METHODS.--Patients were at bed rest and received intravenous hydration. Linear analog scale for pain intensity and verbal pain scale, level of alertness, and vital signs were assessed prior to therapy, every 60 minutes thereafter, and at the time of discharge from the ED. Patients were randomized to Int-IV or PCA. During phase 1, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 4 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 2 mg bolus then 1.0 mg with a 6-minute lockout. During phase 2, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 8 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 5 mg bolus then 2.7 mg with a 10-minute lockout. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test, general linear modeling, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi 2 test. RESULTS.--During phase 1, 10 patients (28.3 +/- 7.3 years) received Int-IV and 10 patients (33.9 +/- 12.5 years) received PCA. Treatment groups did not differ significantly regarding duration of pain, amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, level of alertness, or vital signs except for a significantly lower final respiratory rate with Int-IV. In phase 2, 12 patients (28.4 +/- 5.6 years) received Int-IV and 13 patients (26.8 +/- 8.1 years) received PCA. The PCA groups had a significantly shorter elapsed time between onset of pain and treatment (7.3 +/- 6.5 hours) when compared with the Int-IV group (18 +/- 16.9 hours). Treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to total amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, vital signs, or level of alertness. The PCA group had a significant reduction in length of stay in the ED during phase 2 when compared with phase 1. The ED discharge rate and the incidence of side effects did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION.--At both the low- and high-dose regimens, PCA is equally safe and effective and may be used in place of Int-IV administration of morphine in the ED treatment of sickle cell crisis pain.\r"

Bayesian analysis demonstrated that the prior probability of toxoplasmosis was increased by the presence of contrast enhancement on computed tomographic scans (0.68) and toxoplasmosis titers greater than 1:64 (0.81). Features associated with decreasing probabilities of toxoplasmosis included the absence of contrast enhancement on computed tomographic scans (0.29) and toxoplasmosis titers less than or equal to 1:64 (0.14). Ten percent of patients had complications of brain biopsy. Treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine produced complications in 29% and serious complications in 8% of treated patients. These data favor empiric therapy for patients with typical features of toxoplasmosis and brain biopsy for defined subsets of patients with atypical features.\r"

Presented are data from 4587 adults who attended a 3-week residential, life-style modification program consisting of a high-complex-carbohydrate, high-fiber, low-fat, and low-cholesterol diet combined with daily aerobic exercise, primarily walking. Total cholesterol values were reduced by 23%, from 6.06 to 4.66 mmol/L (234 to 180 mg/dL). Low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) values were also reduced by 23%, from 3.9 to 3.0 mmol/L (151 to 116 mg/dL), with most of the change occurring during the first 2 weeks. Male subjects showed a greater reduction in total cholesterol (24.4% vs 20.8%) and LDL-C (25% vs 19.4%) values compared with female subjects. Follow-up studies for 18 months on a small group showed that, in most cases, continued compliance with the program maintained total cholesterol values well below 5.18 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), the level recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program. High-density cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced by 16%, but the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C was reduced by 11%. Female subjects showed a greater drop in HDL-C values than did male subjects (19.4% vs 11.6%). Serum triglyceride values were reduced by 33%, from 2.29 to 1.54 mmol/L (200 to 135 mg/dL); again, male subjects showed a greater reduction than the did female subjects (37.9% vs 22.5%). Body weight was also significantly reduced, 5.5% for male subjects and 4.4% for female subjects. These results show that most adults can significantly reduce serum lipid values and the risk for atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae through life-style modification consisting of diet and exercise.\r"

The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans were evaluated for abnormal localization of tracer. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed for vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Thirty of the 64 patients had pheochromocytomas. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan had a sensitivity and a specificity of 88%. The 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid and norepinephrine measurements had the best sensitivity (97%), while the vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid measurements had the best specificity (91%). In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and the 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were normal, no pheochromocytomas were found. In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were abnormal, a pheochromocytoma was always present. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan often documents the presence or absence of a pheochromocytoma and provides localization of the tumor in the preoperative evaluation of these patients.\r"

An aneroid sphygmomanometer was defined as intolerant if it deviated from the mercury manometer by greater than +/- 3 mm Hg at two or more of the test points. The three most common physical defects were indicator needles not pointing to the \"zero box,\" cracked face plates, and defective tubing. Eighty (34.8 of the 230 aneroid sphygmomanometers were determined to be intolerant with the greatest frequency of deviation seen at pressure levels of 150 mm Hg or greater. We recommend that aneroid manometers be inspected for physical defects and calibrated for accuracy against a standard mercury manometer at 6-month intervals to prevent inaccurate blood pressure measurements.\r"

Four niacin treatment groups (daily doses of 2000, 1500, 1250, and 1000 mg) were compared with placebo- and diet-treated controls to determine side-effect profile and optimal range of efficacy. The groups given 2000 and 1500 mg demonstrated significant reductions in values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-26% and -19.3%, respectively), total cholesterol (-18.4% and -13.3%), and total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (-20.4% and -19.4%) when compared with diet- and placebo-treated controls. Smaller improvements were seen in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Blood chemistry monitoring indicated that reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level strongly correlated with an increase in baseline levels of some enzymes for niacin-treated subjects. The improved side-effect profile of the wax-matrix form of niacin was particularly notable. The dropout rate due to side effects was only 3.4% and was coupled with good medication compliance.\r"

Veterans have an increased prevalence of smoking, are predominantly male, and may have higher rates of other risk factors than other groups; therefore, they may require more aggressive screening and treatment for dyslipidemias. To assess the prevalence of cardiac risk factors, current cholesterol screening practices, and the potential impact of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines on the Veterans Affairs health care system, we reviewed 185 randomly selected charts of outpatients who were actively receiving follow-up at the Denver (Colo) Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The patients had an average age of 58.3 years and 99.5% were male. Of these patients, 60% had a serum cholesterol level checked within the last 999 days. Nearly all patients (84%) had two or more risk factors noted. The mean cholesterol level was 5.85 mmol/L (226 mg/dL), with 72% of patients having levels above 5.20 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and 36.1% having levels above 6.20 mmol/L (240 mg/dL). Of patients who had their cholesterol level checked, 69% (77/111) would require lipoprotein analysis by National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (cholesterol, greater than or equal to 6.20 mmol/L [greater than or equal to 240 mg/dL] or 5.15 to 6.20 mmol/L [200 to 239 mg/dL] with two or more risk factors), yet only 16% (12/77) had lipoprotein analyses done. Extrapolating from these data, the Denver Veteran Affairs Medical Center, which cares for 28,000 patients, has more than 19,000 patients who would need lipoprotein analysis to meet current guidelines. Full evaluation and subsequent treatment of dyslipidemias in veterans would require tremendous financial and manpower commitments.\r"

Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities. It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits.

This sequela of sleep apnea is not surprising, since subjects with sleep apnea may be poor drivers with a high accident rate and a high incidence of \"near-miss\" vehicular incidents. Because drivers with untreated sleep apnea may cause a large number of preventable automobile accidents, physicians have specific duties involving these drivers. First, physicians must try to identify impaired drivers with sleep apnea before they have an accident; routinely asking patients about loud snoring and hypersomnolence may help identify these impaired drivers. Second, physicians must consider the diagnosis of sleep apnea when examining patients who fall asleep while driving. Next, physicians must warn their patients with sleep apnea about the risks of driving with untreated sleep apnea. Finally, physicians must treat any seriously impaired driver with sleep apnea and keep these patients from driving until they can receive successful treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Using 1989 College of American Pathologists Maternal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Survey data, we found virtually no association between a laboratory's AFP test volume and the reliability of reported multiples of the median uncorrected for maternal weight, race, or diabetes. We also found no differences in AFP gestational age-specific medians across geographic regions of the United States. We did find that clinically important adjustments for maternal weight, race, and diabetes were made more frequently by laboratories with higher clinical AFP test volumes. Consequently, we believe that a minimum AFP test volume for satisfactory performance of AFP testing, as proposed by several professional organizations, cannot be justified on inability of laboratories with low AFP test volumes to quantify AFP in clinical specimens or calculated uncorrected multiples of the medians accurately. However, high-volume laboratories enhance clinical utility of the reported AFP results by making clinically important adjustments of their reported multiples of the medians, and they tend to provide more accurate clinical interpretations. Therefore, we recommend that efforts to improve the quality of AFP testing nationally should focus on improving the ability of laboratories to provide appropriate adjustments to and clinical interpretation of their AFP results, in addition to more traditional efforts directed toward quality control of the analytical aspects of the AFP assay.\r"

The placenta is an important potential means of establishing that fetal damage causes bad pregnancy outcome independently of clinical care.

In the vast majority of cases of spontaneous abortion, the embryo/fetus has been dead for 1 week to several weeks and is most often lost in the process of uterine emptying; the placenta, accordingly, stands as the main \"witness\" of the abortive process. The fact of embryonic/fetal death is established and dated through an interpretation of gross and microscopic changes in the villous stroma, including its vessels and the embryonic erythrocytes therein. Elective abortions performed for social reasons occasionally yield abnormal findings that suggest gestations otherwise destined to eventual spontaneous abortion. Other therapeutic abortions are indicated by abnormal sonographic or cytogenetic findings that may be correlated with the morphologic features of the evacuated conceptus. Cytogenetic abnormalities correlate to a high degree with embryonic growth disorganization and with early death, usually before the fetal stage (30 mm) is reached. Adequate sampling of the placenta, its membranes, and of the embryo/fetus is recommended. For cytogenetic studies, clean, viable specimens must be obtained; these are most often required in cases of habitual abortion.\r"

The earliest histologically convincing lesion acceptable as acute atherosis was fibrinoid necrosis with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, while lipophages were a late phenomenon. Any maternal uterine vessel that had not undergone physiologic vascular changes could be affected by acute atherosis. Acute atherosis was not seen in normal pregnancies or in pregnancies of diabetic women but was seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, or both. In pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age infants, acute atherosis was not seen in the vessels in the decidua parietalis.\r"

The human placenta needs to be examined when there are complications during pregnancy, labor, and delivery; when the fetus is born with apparent problems; and when the delivered placenta is abnormal. Placentas are routinely immersion fixed with neutral buffered 3.7% to 4.0% formaldehyde solution before examination and without obtaining a fresh weight. This study was undertaken to determine if there was a significant change in weight between a fresh and fixed placenta. The results show a 7.67% increase in placental weight after formaldehyde fixation for 24 hours. Thus, the practice of formaldehyde fixation prior to weighing and examination can be continued and still allow for accurate estimation of fresh placental weight.\r"

Microwave-induced cyclodestruction was successful in reducing intraocular pressure in all treated glaucomatous eyes for 4 weeks. Two additional glaucomatous eyes were left untreated to serve as controls, and were noted to have persistently elevated intraocular pressures. Six additional eyes were then subjected to an equivalent treatment (50 degrees C in five 1-minute applications), which resulted in approximately 180 degrees of heat treatment just posterior to the corneoscleral limbus. These specimens were evaluated with light microscopy at baseline, 24 hours, and 7 days after treatment. Our clinical and histopathologic evaluations suggested that microwave thermotherapy (delivered under thermometry control) allowed for chorioretinal/ciliary body destruction that resulted in reductions of intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes.\r"

  ".W": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a potent endothelial cell mitogen that has been proposed to play a role in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other neovascular processes. Our understanding of the in vivo role of basic FGF in the pathogenesis of these disorders is limited. We studied the immunolocalization of basic FGF in 16 clinical cases of diabetic retinopathy to determine whether the normal retinal distribution of basic FGF changed during the development of diabetic retinopathy and correlated with the onset of retinal neovascularization. By using monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against basic FGF and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), we found that basic FGF colocalized with HSPG to vascular basement membranes. As the basement membranes thickened during the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the intraretinal stores of immunoreactive basic FGF and HSPG expanded. With the development of neovascularization, the colocalization of basic FGF and HSPG changed; HSPG localized to basement membranes, while basic FGF localized intracellularly, with only minimal basement membrane immunoreactivity. Incubations of the neovascular fronds with exogenous basic FGF demonstrated multiple HSPG glycosaminoglycan-binding sites for basic FGF, indicating that basic FGF had not been released from the matrix of neovascular fronds by heparitanase digestion.\r"

The extent of ocular involvement has been difficult to determine because the toxicity is restricted to humans and nonhuman primates due to species differences in methanol metabolism. A rodent model of methanol toxicity recently developed by us was used to evaluate retinal dysfunction in methanol poisoning. Formic acidemia and visual toxic reactions developed in methanol-intoxicated rats. Electroretinographic analysis indicated a significant early deficit in b-wave amplitude followed by a temporally delayed, lesser reduction in a-wave amplitude. Histologic evaluation of the eyes 60 hours after methanol administration revealed generalized retinal edema and vacuolation in the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Ultrastructural examination showed swelling and disruption of the mitochondria in photoreceptor inner segments, optic nerve, and the retinal pigment epithelium. These studies document direct retinal involvement in this nonprimate model of methanol toxicity.\r"

Four showed dramatic fraying of the collagen fibrils into fine filaments 2 to 3 nm in diameter. In three of these cases and three other cases without fraying, there were foci of 10- to 35-nm small collagen fibrils, some appearing to arise by splitting of otherwise normal collagen fibrils. In areas of fraying, elastic fibers were absent. All patients had a wider range of collagen diameters than did control subjects. The youngest patient with fraying also had Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. In three patients, no collagen abnormality was found. The clinical feature correlating best with the presence of abnormal collagen was an extremely small eye, since the three patients without collagen abnormality had the largest eyes (range of anteroposterior diameters, 19.2 to 20.3 mm). Nanophthalmos appears to result from several distinct defects.\r"

In the first stage, three or four bone-anchored fixtures were placed into the bony orbital rim. Skin penetration and abutment placement were performed in the second-stage operation, performed 3 to 6 months later. Successful osseointegration was achieved in 17 (94.4%) of 18 fixtures in five nonirradiated patients. All five patients were successfully fitted with an implant-retained prosthesis. One patient who underwent irradiation lost all four fixtures that had been placed. This patient chose to wear a black patch rather than a conventional prosthesis held in with adhesive. Average follow-up was 16 months for the five patients who were successfully fitted with orbital prostheses (range, 6 to 30 months).\r"

Most cases of infarction after administration of gentamicin occurred in eyes that received an intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg after vitrectomy, but a surprisingly high number, 17, occurred after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg, doses that are considered safe by many ophthalmologists. Four additional cases of infarction occurred in eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg. Four of the five cases related to administration of amikacin occurred after intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg, and one of these four occurred in an eye that did not undergo vitrectomy. Twenty-three cases of macular infarction occurred in eyes that were treated with prophylactic subconjunctival injections of aminoglycosides after routine ocular surgery. Responses from this survey suggest that aminoglycoside-induced retinal infarction is widely recognized and more common than indicated from the small number of cases reported in the literature. The role of aminoglycosides in the prophylaxis of ocular infections and the management of endophthalmitis should be reevaluated.\r"

The mechanism of injury was an important prognostic indicator of final visual outcome. Eight (62%) of 13 eyes that sustained knife or nail injuries achieved a final visual acuity of 20/50 or better, while only six (16%) with missile injuries achieved a similar level of acuity. Final visual outcome correlated well with the state of the macula and was not predicted by preoperative visual acuity. Despite improvement in surgical techniques and instrumentation, no trend toward improved visual outcomes was identified during the 12-year period.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed instrumentation to improve the visualization of fine vitreoretinal structures at the macula during slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The instrument, mounted on a slit-lamp microscope, used a green helium-neon laser to deliver a narrow beam, 15 micron(s) in width and 2 mm in length. The intersection of the laser slit with the ocular structures was viewed at an angle, as in conventional slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The instrument was used to examine patients with idiopathic macular holes or cysts. The results indicated that the new illumination was superior due to the narrow width of the beam, the enhanced brightness, and the monochromacy in green, which reduced background scatter. These advantages allowed for visualization of fine retinal structures that are difficult to detect with conventional slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The findings in patients with idiopathic macular hole demonstrated that the operculum was located approximately 500 micron(s) anterior to the surrounding retina and moved minimally. This suggested that the operculum may be supported by partially detached posterior vitreous cortex, and that a macular hole is the result of tangential traction followed by axial traction caused by a contracted and detached cortical vitreous gel.\r"

In all eyes from individuals aged 21 years or older, dissection of the retina off the vitreous resulted in cleavage between the vitreous cortex and the internal limiting lamina. However, in six (40%) of 15 eyes from individuals aged 20 years or younger, the internal limiting lamina remained adherent to the vitreous cortex in an area that encompassed the macula, temporal arcades, and peripapillary posterior pole. Ultrastructural studies revealed inner portions of Muller's cells that were attached to the posterior aspect of the internal limiting lamina. These results suggested that, in youth, there is adhesion between the vitreous cortex and internal limiting lamina that is stronger than Muller's cell itself and is topographically more extensive than previously thought.\r"

Both histocompatibility antigens and tissue-specific antigens may be potential targets for such an immune response. To identify relevant responses, the humoral immune response against corneal tissue and the cellular immune response against one specific corneal protein were determined in patients before and after corneal transplantation. The results were compared with known risk factors for corneal transplantation, but no correlations were observed. A conversion from negative to positive in cellular immune response against the cornea-specific protein was seen in patients who had experienced an inflammatory episode during the time interval between measurements. The anticorneal protein response may therefore be the result of an intraocular inflammatory response, but not a prognostic factor to help predict the patients at risk for rejection.\r"

The remaining inflammatory cells in the vitreous were mostly macrophages (10% to 15%); very few lymphocytes were present (less than 5%). Immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibodies confirmed the paucity of lymphocytes. Most lymphocytes were CD4+ helper/inducer T cells. Almost no CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes or B lymphocytes were found. The inflammatory response in these two patients is most characteristic of acute inflammation and consistent with an underlying bacterial infection, despite a clinical picture of persistent, low-grade inflammation. Infection with P acnes has been shown to inhibit CD8+ T cells and may play a role in the persistent inflammation in cases of P acnes endophthalmitis.\r"

The ratio of CD4 cells (T-helper/inducer) to CD8 cells (T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells) in the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen was almost 1:1 compared with 24:1 in the Mooren's ulcer specimen. In addition, less than 5% of the infiltrating cells from the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen stained positive for CD22 (B cells), compared with 25% to 50% from the Mooren's ulcer specimen. These data may help explain why Terrien's marginal degeneration runs a more benign course than does Mooren's ulcer and provides a rationale for the use of immunosuppressive drugs to treat Mooren's ulcer.\r"

Comparison among these groups revealed similar frequencies of lens opacities among age groups, with slightly higher rates for older individuals in the watermen study population. Comparison between the watermen and the surgical groups revealed that, of lenses with opacities, posterior subcapsular cataracts were present in a far greater percentage of surgery cases (60.6%) than in general population cases (5.3%). These findings confirm the generally held clinical belief that posterior subcapsular opacities are disproportionally represented in the surgical population and suggest that they cause more significant visual disability than do other types of cataracts.\r"

Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months. Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes. Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo.

Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older.\r"

In addition, a less mature CD7+19+ population was characterized as mu- and CD34+/-. The CD7+19+ population was clearly distinct from the mature T cells. The CD7+19+ cells were negative for nuclear TdT in contrast to CD7-19+ cells, which frequently contained TdT. CD10, which is coexpressed on the cell surface of more than 90% of CD19+ lymphocytes, was detected in a minority of CD7+19+ lymphocytes. The CD7+19+34+ cell population may be B-lineage committed, or may represent uncommitted lymphoid precursors. The biologic role of the expression of CD7 on immature and mature cells, including those of the B lineage, may indicate (1) the presence of CD7+19+ lymphoid precursor cells and/or (2) an alternate pathway of B-cell development, in which cells coexpress CD7 with other B-lineage markers.\r"

  ".W": "The part that candida plays in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was investigated in 24 elderly inpatients (mean age 74 years) who tested negative for Clostridium difficile toxin and other intestinal pathogens. 7 had intestinal overgrowth of Candida species (greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu/ml). None of the 24 matched, antibiotic-treated controls without diarrhoea had candida overgrowth. All 5 patients with diarrhoea and candida overgrowth treated with oral nystatin responded with resolution of diarrhoea and lowering of faecal counts to less than 10(4) cfu/ml within 7 days of start of antifungal therapy despite continuation of antibacterial therapy. In the other 2 patients with candida overgrowth, the diarrhoea subsided spontaneously and faecal candida counts returned to normal (less than 10(4) cfu/ml) after antibacterial agents were withdrawn. In patients without candida overgrowth, diarrhoea persisted until antibiotics were withdrawn, at a mean of 16 days after study entry.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) can be used reliably and accurately by inexperienced observers, ratings made by observers grouped by level of experience were examined for within-group interobserver disagreements and for discrepancies with scores given by an expert. The GCS was used accurately by experienced and highly trained users, but inexperienced users made consistent errors. The errors were such that they would not be detectable by studies that examine only interobserver agreement, and they were substantial, averaging in some cases more than one point on the four-point and five-point scales of the GCS. Also, the error rates were highest at the intermediate levels of consciousness, for which the detection of changes in condition is vital. The findings support the continued use of the GCS by appropriately qualified personnel, but call into question much of the conventional wisdom about its reliability when used by untrained or inexperienced staff. The findings also suggest that interobserver comparisons are insufficient for establishing the viability of the GCS.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the in vivo prevalence of AZT resistance mutations in AID patients after long-term therapy we amplified, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a 654 bp pol gene fragment from peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA samples from a patient before, and 19 months after, the start of AZT therapy. PCR products from each sample were cloned and 9 clones from each sample were sequenced. Seven of 9 clones from the post-AZT sample, but none from the pre-AZT sample, contained an amino acid substitution (Thr215 to Tyr) requiring two nucleotide changes within the same codon (ACC to TAC). This change had previously been shown by Larder and Kemp (Science, 246:1155-1158, 1989) to correlate with partial AZT resistance of virus isolates. In colony hybridizations using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the mutant and wild-type sequences, 22 of 22 clones from the pre-AZT sample hybridized only to the wild-type probe while 21 of 26 clones from the post-AZT sample hybridized only to the mutant. Clinically, this patient remains well, indicating that while Tyr215 may be the first amino acid substitution leading to resistance, it alone does not appear to have significantly influenced the clinical status of this patient.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine if protection against an infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) challenge could be obtained in cynomolgus macaques by active immunization using whole killed virus vaccine. Four monkeys were immunized with killed HIV-2SBL-6669, two of them with five intramuscular (im) injections of viral preparation containing 100 or 300 micrograms protein emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and the two remaining received four im injections of 25-50 micrograms viral protein in iscoms. Each of the four vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys, along with four unvaccinated controls, were challenged intravenously two weeks after the last booster with approximately 100 animal infectious doses (ID50) of live HIV-2SBL-6669. All four immunized monkeys developed antibodies to HIV-2 envelope and core proteins before challenge exposure to HIV-2, but only the two animals vaccinated with virus in IFA developed detectable neutralizing antibodies. The two monkeys immunized with killed virus in IFA have shown no evidence of infection nine months after challenge with live virus. When blood and lymph node cells from these animals were transfused into naive cynomolgus monkeys, the recipients remained free of infection. In contrast, virus was recovered repeatedly in all nonimmunized animals and in the two animals immunized with iscom-associated viral antigens, which had a low content of envelope gp125 antigen. The demonstration of vaccine-induced protection against HIV-2 in a nonhuman primate raises hope for effective immunization against HIV infections in humans as well.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of dominant linear antigenic sites in the envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) was evaluated. Twenty-five peptides representing different regions of HIV-2, strain SBL-6669, were synthesized. For comparison the corresponding peptides of HIV-1, strain BRU, were also prepared. The peptides were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human sera from individuals with proven HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection and simian sera from animals infected with HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabay monkey origin (SIVsm). Four major antigenic regions were identified. Peptides representing parts or the whole V3 (neutralizing loop) region and an additional stretch of amino acids located at the carboxy terminal of this region showed considerable reactivity. This reaction was predominantly type specific, but some heterotypic reactivity was also seen. Peptides representing the carboxy terminal 21 amino acids of the V3 region of the type-related viruses HIV-2 and SIVsm allowed selective identification of strain-specific antibodies. A second major antigenic region was found close to the carboxy terminal end of the large glycoproteins. This region was cross-reactive between the two types. The two additional dominating antigenic regions were located in the amino terminal region of the transmembrane glycoprotein. One region has previously been shown to be a uniquely antigenic type-specific site. The other region was also type-specific, but was identified only in HIV-2, amino acids Glu634-Lys649. Excellent facilities are available for the design of not only type-unique site-specific serological tests but potentially also type-cross-reactive and strain-specific assays.\r"

In an attempt to understand the basis of this phenomenon, we examined in detail one such isolate, HIV-1G. We found correctly processed forms of the viral reverse transcriptase in virions as well as processed forms of other viral proteins, suggesting that viral proteins are both expressed and properly processed. We have detected a nuclease activity associated with the outer face of the HIV-1G envelope. This nuclease degrades the DNA product generated during the reverse transcription assay. The nuclease activity is more sensitive to mild protein denaturation than is the viral reverse transcriptase, and it is stimulated by the presence of Ca2+. The amount of virion-associated nuclease activity relative to reverse transcriptase activity varies between virus isolates and can vary also for one isolate during virus spread through a culture. The origin of the nuclease activity is unknown but is presumed to be cellular. The variability in amount of nuclease activity may reflect variability in the interaction of the virus with different cellular components during maturation.\r"

However, p24 was not found in the cell nuclei and was accumulated in the nuclear washing buffer. The data presented confirm the presence of karyotypic signal at the N terminus of p55 gag precursor. The potential role of nuclear localization of gag precursor is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a synthetic peptide of the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in order to further characterize the biochemical and functional nature of this protein and its role in the control of HIV-1 transcriptional regulation. Earlier studies indicated nef to be a negative regulatory factor for viral transcription, whereas more recent studies report evidence against this original hypothesis. Nef is a protein of 206 amino acids of approximately 27 kD in most HIV-1 isolates; however, in some other isolates a truncated form of 124 amino acids has been described. A peptide sequence of six amino acids, corresponding to a region of the nef protein exhibiting high-sequence homology to thymosin alpha 1 protein, has been synthesized by Merrifield solid-phase methodology. This peptide is coded by a sequence located upstream to the stop codon described in some HIV-1 isolates and then is maintained in both complete and truncated forms of the nef protein. F14.11 is a nef peptide-specific monoclonal antibody (IgG2a/k) exhibiting the ability to recognize natural nef protein in either radioimmunoassay, radioimmunoprecipitation assay, or immunocytochemical analysis. Since F14.11 is able to identify nef protein in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from HIV-infected seronegative subjects it may prove useful in monitoring the expression of nef during the silent HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "In a preliminary study, two of four rabbits infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) demonstrated prolonged primary chancres following superinfection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis. Two rabbits inoculated with 1 x 10(7) HTLV-I-infected human MT-2 cells and two with infected rabbit cells from a line established in this laboratory (RLT-P), developed latent HTLV-I infection as detected by seroconversion 10 weeks after infection and by detection of HTLV-I sequences in the DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes after amplification by polymerase chair reaction (PCR) 15 weeks after infection. The rabbits remained clinically normal and had normal blood counts. Six months after infection, the four HTLV-infected rabbits and two noninfected controls were challenged by the intradermal inoculation of 1 x 10(6) Treponema pallidum into eight sites on the shaved back. The lesions of two of the HTLV-I-infected rabbits had a time course similar to non-HTLV-I-infected controls and were completely healed by 4 weeks. The lesions of one of the other two rabbits with progressive disease began to heal about 7 weeks after T. pallidum challenge. The cutaneous lesions in the other rabbit remained dark-field positive and became a confluent eschar at 8 weeks; healing only after treatment with penicillin. Four months after the primary challenge none of the six rabbits previously challenged with T. pallidum had developed lesions after rechallenge and thus expressed chancre immunity. These results demonstrate that rabbits with latent HTLV-I infections may have defective cell-mediated immunity.\r"

HIV-infected groups were comprised of asymptomatic homosexuals (n = 131), AIDS-related complex (n = 115), Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 300), AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (n = 76), and high-grade lymphomas (n = 12). Only two patients were known to be intravenous drug users. No instances of dual retroviral infection were detected. As a corollary, no cross reactivity between HTLV and HIV gene products was noted by RIPA. We conclude that HTLV infection is uncommon among select groups of HIV seropositive homosexuals who do not engage in intravenous drug abuse. Additional studies examining the seroprevalence and consequence of HTLV infection in broader based populations at risk for retroviral infection are required.\r"

Thirty three fetal samples: thymus, spleen, and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBC) were obtained at abortion (16 to 24 weeks) from HIV-1-infected asymptomatic women. The results of HIV-1-DNA detection were considered only in 9 cases where contamination of fetal samples by infected mother cells could be definitely eliminated by using primers specific for a polymorphic cellular locus. PCR allowed the identification of HIV-1 DNA sequences in 6/8, 8/9, and 5/9 of specimens from thymus, spleen, and PMBC, respectively. Positive results were shown in fetuses as early as 16 weeks. Viral cultures as well as assays for serum p24 HIV-1 antigen were negative in 9.9 and 33/33 tested, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate early and frequent in utero HIV-1 infection. Different patterns of viral activation after birth might then lead to either rapid or delayed onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Proviral sequences were detected in the saliva of 50% of the patients. Sequential samples of saliva, collected at four different times, from each of six additional patients led to the detection of proviral sequences in 100% of the patients. Since, however, the detection of HIV-1 required not only the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but also multiple samples, it appears that under ordinary circumstances infected cells are present in saliva in low numbers. Although this may explain the lack of transmission of HIV-1 by casual contact through the salivary route to household members and health-care workers, the presence of infected cells in the saliva of a high percentage of patients argues for avoidance of sexually intimate situations involving prolonged and repeated contact with saliva.\r"

The efficiency of the system was evaluated by calculating the fractional utilization of fresh gas in 10 ASA I-III patients during anaesthesia with controlled ventilation. Maximum efficiency occurred when the minute ventilation to fresh gas flow ratio was greater than 1.5. Under these conditions, fractional utilization was relatively constant with a value of 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.78). The minimum fresh gas flow for use during controlled ventilation was determined in another eight ASA I-III patients when the minute volume to fresh gas ratio was greater than 1.5. In view of an increased arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure difference in patients in the first part of the study (1.03 kPa), normocapnia was defined as an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 4.3 kPa. Normocapnia was achieved with a mean fresh gas flow of 66 ml kg(-1) min(-1), while 70 ml kg(-1) min(-1) produced mild hypocapnia.\r"

The main outcome measures were time to bilateral analgesia of T6 or higher, need for intraoperative analgesic supplements, observer rating of intraoperative analgesia and patient assessment of analgesia using a 10-cm visual analogue scale. The time to onset of analgesia to T6 was reduced insignificantly by the fentanyl solutions compared with adrenaline only. The quality of analgesia as assessed by the need for analgesic supplements was superior for the patients given fentanyl. An observer rating of pain and visual analogue pain scoring by the patient also indicated superior analgesia with fentanyl supplementation. Two patients experienced respiratory depression after extradural fentanyl and were given naloxone. Two neonates were also given naloxone. Close supervision is therefore recommended in the early postoperative period when this technique is used.\r"

The median thoracic dermatomal levels were 4.5 for LT, 2.0 for PP and 2.0 for TE. Zones of differential sensory block developed within 5 min of extradural injection of local anaesthetic, and persisted for the next 55 min. In all instances, PP extended more cephalad than LT, and TE extended above PP levels. There were no differences in the extent of zones between the two groups of patients with mean ages of 28 and 48 yr. Thus, during extradural anaesthesia, sympathetic denervation extended one to two spinal segments above the sensory levels of LT and PP anaesthesia, age (28 vs 48 yr) affected neither the cephalad extent nor the width of zones of differential block, and PP levels of anaesthesia were closer to presumed levels of sympathetic block than were LT levels.\r"

Pain and its subsequent relief were assessed by means of a visual analogue scale. Two of the subjects found diamorphine acted quicker than morphine, one found no difference and nine found that morphine was quicker than diamorphine. The mean time to diamorphine effect was 53% greater than for morphine (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). These findings suggest that, for rapid relief of pain, morphine is more suitable than diamorphine.\r"

After operation the patients were given 0.1 ml kg-1 of a blinded solution followed by 0.05 ml kg-1 min-1 until either they awoke or the 10-ml ampoule of solution was empty. Efficacy of antagonism of midazolam was assessed by times to eye opening and self identification, modified Steward coma scale, a post-box toy completion-time ratio and qualitatively by an independent observer. The difference between flumazenil and placebo was both clinically and statistically different in the first 2 h. Children receiving flumazenil awoke approximately four times faster and identified themselves nearly three times sooner; 65% of this group could complete the post-box toy at 10 min, compared with none of the placebo group. There were no cases of resedation, but one child did not awaken for 30 min after i.v. administration of flumazenil 1.0 mg. The mean total dose of flumazenil administered was 0.024 (SD 0.019) mg kg-1. Flumazenil rapidly antagonized midazolam-induced hypnosis in children and was associated with minimal change in cardiorespiratory variables.\r"

Results indicate that balance was affected significantly (P less than 0.008) up to 45 min after i.v. midazolam and did not return to control values until 105 min. The quantified version of the Romberg test performed with the eyes open or closed using the Equitest did not appear to be sensitive in detecting residual effects of midazolam on balance. We conclude that healthy, young persons should not be considered to have regained postural stability for up to 105 min after sedation with midazolam. Dynamic posturography appears to be a useful test in the objective assessment of balance disturbances.\r"

In the presence of verapamil, increases in isoflurane concentrations caused dose-dependent myocardial depression both before and after critical coronary constriction. The systemic and coronary vasodilatation associated with high concentrations of isoflurane did not occur in the presence of verapamil. The association of verapamil with isoflurane caused regional myocardial dysfunction that worsened at high isoflurane concentrations. This regional dysfunction could not be antagonized in two dogs. The effects of isoflurane on regional function were not modified by application of a critical coronary constriction.\r"

It was attenuated severely or possibly abolished with loss of consciousness, and reappeared at low amplitude 5-10 min later and remained attenuated until the end of surgery. The amplitude increased with early signs of awakening in the Intensive Care Unit. With few exceptions, changes in the simultaneously recorded EEG were similar to those of the ASSR. The ASSR deserves further evaluation as a tool for monitoring level of consciousness during high-dose opioid anaesthesia.\r"

Consequently, we have investigated the effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and, for comparison, the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol on inositol-lipid metabolism of malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and healthy control (MHN) swine. The experiments were performed on electrically stimulated (frequency 0.2 Hz) trabeculae isolated from the right ventricles of the hearts of MHS and MHN animals. After labelling with [3H]inositol for 6 h, different inositol phosphates were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, including inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. After stimulation with isoproterenol, the inositol phosphate content did not increase or vary between muscle from MHS and MHN animals. In contrast, all inositol phosphates increased after stimulation with phenylephrine in both muscle types, the effects being greater in MHS than in MHN, especially as regards 1,4,5-IP3 content. As 1,4,5-IP3, a presumed second messenger, has been shown to mobilize intracellular calcium, it is concluded that an enhanced alpha-adrenergic response is involved in the development of MH.\r"

The antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine, dimethyl sulphoxide and allopurinol were found to ameliorate the injury. This suggests a possible link with the pulmonary damage and survival of rats in hyperoxia, which may be modulated also by antioxidant therapy.\r"

Through binding to specific receptors on target cells, these hormone-like products regulate many normal cell activities, including growth and differentiation, migration and immune functions. Within the epidermis, keratinocytes are the major source of cytokines along with melanocytes and Langerhans cells. In response to a variety of injurious stimuli, including ultraviolet irradiation and cutaneous wounding, epidermal keratinocytes may release a number of these regulatory molecules which can then interact directly with receptors on inflammatory cells. Epidermal cytokines can therefore play an important role in the wound-healing process by recruiting polymorphs and monocytes and in encouraging deposition of extracellular matrix proteins by fibroblasts. Keratinocytes can themselves respond to keratinocyte-derived cytokines by dividing and migrating over the wound surface before differentiating into a new stratified epidermis. This review presents the evidence of the production of cytokines by human keratinocytes and their role in the healing of skin wounds.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the molecular events which are important in leucocyte trafficking in cutaneous inflammation, poison ivy/oak extract was applied topically to the skin, and the simultaneous assessment of a variety of clinical and immunopathological parameters performed. The clinical response of subjects was divided into three main groups: I, 2-24h after application, before the onset of erythema; II, 48 h-1 week after application during maximal clinical changes; III, 2-3 weeks after application when the inflammation had subsided. Six different biopsies per subject were evaluated over the study period and the density of dermal cellular infiltrate, and the distribution of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, (ICAM-1), endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1, (ELAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, (VCAM-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), determined. Eight hours after exposure, before lymphocytes and monocytes had entered the dermal interstitium or epidermis, the keratinocytes expressed TNF-alpha and ICAM-1, whilst the endothelial cells expressed ELAM-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Group II biopsies revealed increasing keratinocyte expression of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 with the appearance of IL-8, which correlated with the onset of epidermal T-cell trafficking. The endothelium was strongly positive for ELAM-1 and VCAM-1, but there was no influx of neutrophils. Group III biopsies showed a decrease in the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 by both keratinocytes and endothelium with a reduction in epidermal/dermal inflammation, although the endothelial cell staining of VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 did not completely disappear. These results suggest that on exposure to poison ivy/oak, keratinocytes rapidly produce TNF-alpha which leads to an early autoinduction of ICAM-1, and later IL-8. There is also a paracrinemediated induction and augmentation of underlying endothelial cell ELAM-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.\r"

In normal skin, CD29 recognized a number of cell types, i.e. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, T lymphocytes and basal keratinocytes. Similar cells were positive in diseased skin, but the expression of VLA beta was upregulated on keratinocytes. The phenotype of the VLA beta-positive T cells was examined in more detail by staining with anti-T-cell antibodies, i.e. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO (UCHL1) and CD45R (2H4). These studies showed that most of the T cells in normal skin, benign cutaneous conditions and early cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) expressed a similar phenotype and resembled antigen committed 'memory' (helper/inducer) cells (CD4+, CD29+, CD45RO+, CD45R-). In advanced CTCL, expression of these antigens was more variable, and many of these infiltrates showed aberrant (or unusual) expression of CD29, CD45RO, CD45R and other T-cell antigens. It is concluded that several cells involved in cutaneous immune reactions express a molecule (VLA beta) which acts as a receptor for extracellular matrix components. This molecule is important for the attachment of cells to connective tissue constituents and may act to facilitate the migration of lymphocytes (and other cells) during immune reactions in normal and diseased cutaneous conditions. Advanced CTCL differ from the early lesions and it is possible that there is a progressive accumulation of increasingly malignant (or transformed) cells in these conditions.\r"

The soluble fraction of PKC activity was comparable in controls and in the fibroblasts obtained from involved areas and not significantly different from the values in fibroblasts from uninvolved skin. PKC activity was also measured in the soluble and particulate fractions of lymphocytes from 13 patients with psoriasis and from 14 normal controls. The PKC activity did not differ in the lymphocytes of patients with psoriasis from the controls in either the cytosolic or the membrane fractions. The increase in PKC activity as expressed at the membrane level of psoriatic fibroblasts may be related to an increase in sensitivity of these cells to hormones or growth factors involved in the regulation of their growth.\r"

Over this 7-year period, 1299 melanomas were diagnosed in all age groups in this geographical area, increasing in incidence by 82% from 135 in 1979 to 246 in 1986. The proportion of melanomas diagnosed before the patients' thirtieth birthday remained constant at 6%. None were diagnosed in the under-15 age-group, and none developed on giant congenital naevi. Forty-two of the 95 melanomas (44%) in the under-30 group developed on a small naevus present either from birth or early childhood. These melanomas were thicker than those apparently developing on normal skin, but once controlled for tumour thickness and sex the presence of a pre-existing naevus did not affect 5-year survival. The overall 5-year survival was 76% with poorer survival associated with thicker tumours and male sex. This study suggests that small early onset naevi may have a higher potential for post-pubertal malignant change than has been previously recognized.\r"

Measuring the area of tracings of plaque outlines using image analysis gave a mean involved surface area of 9% and image analysis of whole body photographs gave a mean value of 7%. We conclude that untrained observers using the rule of nines will overestimate the extent of psoriasis and that image analysis of whole body photographs is comparable to that of traced outlines.\r"

This technique was most applicable to skin topography with a reliable geometrical pattern of triangles and squares, a feature of hair-bearing surfaces in general and in particular, the antecubital fossa. Using standardized trauma of various types the origin of skin surface markings were found to be located in the dermis. The technique was applied to the healing of experimental trauma produced by tape stripping, the resolution of clinical eczema and a comparison of steroid-treated and untreated tape-stripped skin.\r"

The resulting erythema was measured objectively 72 h after irradiation and dose-response curves for psoralen-UVA erythema were constructed. Although the dose of 8-MOP was calculated according to body weight, patients receiving 30 mg of 8-MOP had a significantly lower mean plasma concentration than those receiving higher doses. There was no significant correlation between plasma 8-MOP concentration and minimal phototoxic dose, either estimated visually or calculated from the dose-response curves. However the slope of the dose-response curve showed significant correlation with plasma 8-MOP concentration. The variation between patients in the rate of increase of the erythemal response, but not the variation in threshold sensitivity, can be explained by difference in plasma psoralen concentration.\r"

There was an association between the population density of aerobic coryneforms and the intensity of odour (Spearman, P = 0.001). Dominance of aerobic coryneforms within the axillary microflora was associated with high odour intensity (chi 2, P = 0.005). An in-vitro odour model was developed using a diethyl ether extract of axillary skin incubated with test bacteria. Underarm odour was produced exclusively by aerobic coryneform bacteria. Of aerobic coryneforms, 71.4% were odour producers and these were identified as Corynebacterium xerosis.\r"

In order to examine these hypotheses, we asked RHD patients, left hemisphere damaged patients (LHD) and normal controls (NC) to judge the emotional content of sentences describing nonverbal expressions, and sentences describing emotional situations. We found that RHD subjects performed normally in their ability to infer the emotion conveyed by sentences describing situations. However, RHD patients were impaired in relation to both LHD and NC in the capacity to judge the emotional content of sentences depicting facial, prosodic, and gestural expressions, suggesting a disruption of nonverbal communicative representations.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a simple procedure for assessing the ability of the visual pathway to extract a two-dimensional shape from motion. The test requires a patient to read motion-defined (MD) letters. These letters differ physically from the familiar contrast-defined (CD) letters that are dimmer or brighter than their surroundings in that the boundaries of MD letters are rendered visible exclusively by a step in velocity while the boundaries of CD letters are rendered visible by a step in luminance. Subjects viewed a random pattern of bright dots containing a perfectly camouflaged letter. Then the letter was revealed by moving dots within and outside the letter at equal speeds in opposite directions. Letter reading scores for 50 eyes of 25 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or optic neuritis were compared with norms based on 50 control subjects. When tested with large (50 arc min, i.e., 6/60) MD letters, 34/50 eyes of patients required abnormally high dot speeds to read letters, visual loss being sufficiently selective in 10 eyes that contrast sensitivity, Snellen acuity, 11%-contrast and 4%-contrast acuity were all spared. Four eyes were effectively motion blind in the sense that they could not read large letters even at our highest relative speed of 0.9 deg/s and the failure could not be attributed to reduced Snellen acuity. Our normal limit was 2.5 SD from the control mean and there were 1/50 false positives. Of the 34/50 eyes with elevated speed thresholds, 23 had normal Snellen acuities. The number of eyes abnormal for intermediate (11%) contrast CD letters, was 19/50 of which 8 had normal Snellen acuity, confirming our previous finding that MS can degrade the ability to see low-contrast objects while sparing Snellen acuity. We conclude that MD test letters can detect lesions that are not picked up by testing with CD test letters of high or low contrast. We suggest that the MD letter test can detect dysfunction in the human equivalent of a pathway in monkey brain that originates in large retinal ganglion cells, passes through the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate body, includes cortical area MT, and is involved in processing motion.\r"

In contrast, auditory functions reflecting intensity or frequency discriminations (difference limens) were only minimally impaired. Pure tone audiometry showed a moderate (50 dB) bilateral hearing loss with a disproportionate severe loss of word intelligibility. Those auditory evoked potentials that were preserved included (1) cochlear microphonics reflecting hair cell activity; (2) cortical sustained potentials reflecting processing of slowly changing signals; and (3) long-latency cognitive components (P300, processing negativity) reflecting endogenous auditory cognitive processes. Both the evoked potential and perceptual deficits are attributed to changes in temporal encoding of acoustic signals perhaps occurring at the synapse between hair cell and eighth nerve dendrites. The results from this patient are discussed in relation to previously published cases with absent auditory evoked potentials and preserved hearing.\r"

The median interval between the onset of the herpes zoster rash and myelopathic symptoms was 12 days, and the subsequent median interval to maximal deficit was 10.5 days. Presenting neurological symptoms were characteristically ipsilateral to the rash, with motor dysfunction predominating, followed by a spinothalamic and, less often, posterior column sensory deficit. Pathological involvement was most severe in the dorsal root entry zone and posterior horn of the spinal cord segment corresponding to the involved dermatome. There was variable spread both horizontally and vertically in the spinal cord. Direct varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of neuroectodermal cells, particularly oligodendrocytes, was demonstrated by immunostaining viral antigens (8 cases), and by the presence of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions (7 cases) and often was associated with focal demyelination (6 cases). In 4 patients a VZV vasculitis was associated with leptomeningitis and haemorrhagic necrosis (spinal cord in 1; brainstem or cerebellum in 3). The protracted evolution in many cases and the pathologically documented direct viral infection of the spinal cord provide a rational basis for the use of antiviral therapy in preventing or attenuating the evolving myelopathy.\r"

A detailed comparison of his new condition with his language status before the second stroke revealed that the newly acquired deficit was limited to tasks related to auditory input. Further investigations demonstrated a speech perceptual disorder, which we analysed as due to deficits both at the level of general auditory processes and at the level of phonetic analysis. We discuss some arguments related to hemisphere specialization of phonetic processing and to the disconnection explanation of word deafness that support the hypothesis of word deafness being generally caused by mixed deficits.\r"

  ".W": "Upright stance and its reflex control were studied in parkinsonian patients and in age-matched normal subjects. They stood unperturbed on a force-measuring surface (static conditions), or were displaced by movement of a supporting platform (dynamic conditions). During quiet stance the following variables were analysed, with eyes open or closed: position of the centre of foot pressure (CFP), average sway area, length of sway path, amplitude and distribution of tonic leg muscle EMG activity. Perturbations of stance were induced by toe-up or toe-down rotations, and by backward or forward translations of the platform. Amplitude of short, medium and long-latency EMG responses to displacement were measured in the tibialis anterior (TA) and in the three heads of the triceps surae (TS) muscle. The perturbations were produced during both free and supported stance (holding onto a stable structure), under which condition normal subjects suppress medium and long-latency responses. Under static conditions, the only significant finding in parkinsonians was represented by a shift in the position of the CFP. This was correlated with the severity of the disease (Webster scale), the less affected patients being shifted backwards and the more affected patients forwards, with respect to normals. Under dynamic conditions, the reflex responses to perturbations of free stance were similar in both groups. Only the medium-latency burst of gastrocnemius lateralis and the long-latency burst TA evoked by TS stretch were larger in parkinsonians. The amplitude of these responses, as well as of all the others, was not related to the Webster score. Within the patients' group, a relationship between position of CFP and area of EMG burst was found for both medium and long-latency TA responses evoked by forward translation and toe-up rotation, respectively. Under supported conditions, the capability to suppress all medium and long-latency muscle responses to any perturbation was lost or impaired in the parkinsonians. The degree of impairment was unrelated to the position of the CFP, but was significantly related to the severity of the disease. The suppression to 40% (supported/nonsupported), of TA response to toe-down rotation is proposed as the point of separation between normals and parkinsonians. The forward projection of the CFP, occurring in the severe stages of the disease, and the increase in amplitude of some responses to perturbations of free stance might be a compensatory adaptation to the anomalous upright posture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In 8 cases there was multifocal loss of myelin throughout the peripheral nervous system with relative preservation of axons. In 1 case there was predominant loss of axons. Inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltration was present in the peripheral nervous system of all cases except 1 case surviving a year. The extent and severity of cell infiltration was variable, usually being less prominent than in previous reports, and sometimes sparing nerves in which myelin destruction was severe. Vesicular dissolution of myelin noted by electron microscopy was considered to be a postmortem artefact. In cases examined within 30 days after the onset, immunohistochemical studies with monoclonal antibodies identified more leucocytes (PD7/2B11+) and T cells (UCHL1+) in the endoneurium than in cases examined later or control cases. These findings and recent single case reports indicate that the pathology of the Guillian-Barre syndrome is variable. This variability may reflect differences in pathogenesis, with greater cell-mediated immunity in some cases and greater antibody targeted macrophage-mediated demyelination in others.\r"

  ".W": "Important questions remain unanswered about the sequence of events leading to progressive and ultimately irreversible tissue damage in MS. This study was designed to investigate the pathological characteristics of, and function of, the blood-brain barrier within longstanding MS lesions using quantitative and Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI techniques. The ultrastructural appearances of postmortem lesions from a single, separate case of MS have been correlated with the MRI findings. Both MRI and ultrastructural analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity in the chronic lesions: some are 'closed' with no detectable extracellular water, but most are 'open' and show expansion of the extracellular space to as much as 87% of tissue area. This variable expansion probably results from differing degrees of axonal loss. Evidence of blood-brain barrier damage was found in only 17% of lesions, was less severe than that seen in acute lesions, and may result from repeated previous inflammatory insults. The findings imply progressive axonal loss in lesions as they age. It is possible that this loss is related to clinical progression of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) was recorded in the peroneal nerve during sleep in 14 sleep-deprived healthy subjects. Continuous noninvasive recordings of finger blood pressure were obtained in 7 subjects. In light sleep (stage 2 sleep) the number of sympathetic bursts/min decreased to 90 +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM) and total MSA (= burst/min x mean burst area) to 89 +/- 5% of the awake value (P less than 0.05, n = 14). In deep sleep (stage 3-4) total MSA decreased further, to 71 +/- 8% of the awake value (n = 5). There was no close correlation between variations of depth of sleep and variations of sympathetic activity but during continuously deepening sleep MSA decreased progressively with time. In stage 2 sleep, high amplitude K complexes were accompanied by short-lasting increases of sympathetic activity. Since these increases of MSA were not preceded by decreases of diastolic blood pressure, which is known to evoke increased sympathetic nerve traffic in muscle nerves, we suggest that K complex related increases of MSA are signs of arousal which elicit both cortical EEG phenomena and activation of cerebral sympathetic centres. During desynchronized (REM) sleep, total MSA increased to 124 +/- 12% of the value in awake state (n = 5). The increases occurred mainly in short irregular periods, often related to rapid eye movements and there was an inverse relationship between the duration of the desynchronized sleep and the increase of total MSA. Our findings are similar to the data obtained in animal experiments and may partly explain changes of blood pressure during synchronized and desynchronized sleep reported previously in man.\r"

The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man.\r"

Eye movements were registered by means of infrared light reflections (pupil-corneal reflection method); the points of visual fixation were continuously calculated by a microprocessor system. Patients with cerebral microangiopathy showed primarily difficulties in holding attention, as reflected by pathologically short durations of gaze on target, frequent unsuccessful anticipations and a high overall number of fixations. In contrast, acute LH stroke patients were characterized by a deficit in shifting attention, as reflected by prolonged latencies and long search durations due to many intervening search fixations. By means of a nonparametric discriminant analysis procedure, about 90% of patients with microangiopathy and about 80% of acute LH stroke patients were reliably distinguished from normal controls. The differences between these two patient groups were most pronounced in the simpler task with predictable targets. Among those patients discriminated from normals, about 96% were correctly reclassified as belonging either to the microangiopathy or to the acute LH stroke group on the basis of their abnormal eye movement variables alone.\r"

  ".W": "In man, an impairment in stereopsis may occur following damage outside the occipital lobes. If local and global stereopsis can be dissociated, this may imply that different mechanisms mediate these functions. We tested 44 patients with unilateral anterior temporal lobe excisions and 23 normal control subjects on two tasks. In the local stereopsis task, subjects indicated which of two pins varying in disparity between 4 and 512 s of arc was closer. Results showed no threshold impairment in any group. In the global stereopsis task, random-dot stereograms varying in binocular correlation were presented in random order, and subjects indicated if the squares perceived in depth were in front of or behind the screen. At binocular correlations between 50% and 70%, left and right temporal lobectomy resulted in a deficit, which was more marked following right-sided excisions. These results are concordant with earlier work (Ptito and Zatorre, 1988), and with other evidence of a right hemisphere superiority in treating binocular depth information. Moreover, the fact that global stereopsis is impaired in the presence of intact local stereopsis suggests that closely related but not identical mechanisms are involved, and fits the notion that there is a hierarchical organization of the visual pathways originating in the striate cortex leading into temporal cortex. Global stereopsis would thus be mediated in temporal lobe areas that receive information about local disparities from more posterior regions.\r"

Many XP children develop a primary neuronal degeneration. We describe 2 unusual XP patients who had a delayed onset of XP neurological disease. Somatic cell genetic studies indicated that they have the same defective DNA repair gene and are both in XP complementation group A. These 2 patients, together with a group A patient previously reported from London, establish as a distinct clinical entity the late onset type of the juvenile onset form of XP neurological disease. The functional capacity of these patients' cultured fibroblast strains to survive after treatment with ultraviolet radiation indicates that their DNA repair defect is less severe than that of typical group A patients who have a more severe neurodegeneration with an earlier symptomatic onset. The premature death of nerve cells in XP patients (which is presumably due to their inherited defects in DNA repair mechanisms) suggests that normal repair of damaged DNA in neurons is required to maintain integrity of the human nervous system.\r"
