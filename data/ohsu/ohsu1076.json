  ".W": "This study comparing the relative white cell (WBC)-depleting efficiency of single and double filtration used two filters and new, sensitive, and reliable methods for performing WBC counts on WBC-depleted blood products. A single filtration of red cell (RBC) concentrates with a cotton-wool filter reduced WBC content by 98.64 percent, but the range of residual WBCs was wide, and many filtered units still contained more than the theoretical immunizing dose of 5 to 10 x 10(6) WBCs. A second filtration, however, always produced RBC units that had less than 5 x 10(6) WBCs. Although the degree of WBC depletion observed after a single filtration of a 6-unit pool of random-donor platelet concentrates was greater with a polyester filter than with the cotton-wool filter (98.92 vs. 98.14% reduction, respectively, when mean prefiltration WBC count was less than 600 x 10(6], in both cases, 25 percent of filtered products still contained greater than 5 x 10(6) WBCs; a second filtration (with the cotton-wool filter), however, produced units that were always below the immunizing dose. All double-filtered platelet concentrates had less than 10(6), and one-half had less than 10(4) residual WBCs. Platelet loss was similar with both filters (+/- 16% loss with one filtration). The effectiveness of the filters in producing products that were WBC-depleted below the immunizing dose was dependent on the prefiltration WBC content (but not on the age of the units), and it may be worthwhile to employ methods to ensure that total prefiltration WBC count of the product is less than 400 x 10(6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood donated during this window period is capable of transmitting the virus. Therefore, the blood of persons who are at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not enter the blood supply. Over a period of 4 months, 6573 potential blood donors who entered fixed and mobile blood collection sites in two cities were exposed to alternative interventions the aim of which was to exclude persons at risk for AIDS. We compared the interventions to one another and to existing materials in terms of the numbers of at-risk persons who did or did not donate for transfusion, the amount of attention paid to the materials, the scores on a comprehension test, and the self-reports by the subjects of attitudes towards the various interventions. At-risk donors who were asked direct AIDS risk behavior questions in addition to the current health history questions were more likely to be screened out than those who underwent alternative health history interviews (p less than 0.01). Potential donors paid more attention to the experimental brochures than to the experimental video or current materials (p less than 0.05). Comprehension scores were better for the new brochure and the video than for the current brochure (p less than 0.05). Donors were not offended by the experimental interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pathologically, the intra- and extrahepatic ducts are dilated and contain soft, pigmented stone and pus. There is proliferation of bile ducts and infiltration of inflammatory cells along the periportal spaces and hepatic parenchyma. Localized intrahepatic segmental ductal stenosis may be present, especially in the lateral segment of the left lobe or posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The cause of the disease is not known, but associations with clonorchiasis, ascariasis, and nutritional deficiency have been suggested. Sonographic and CT findings include intra- or extrahepatic duct stones, dilatation of the extrahepatic duct with relatively mild or no dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts, localized dilatation of the lobar or segmental bile ducts, increased periportal echogenicity, segmental hepatic atrophy, and gallstones. Cholangiographic findings include bile duct stones; disproportionately severe dilatation of the extrahepatic ducts with mild or no dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts; and focal strictures, acute peripheral tapering, straightening, rigidity, decreased arborization, and an increased branching angle of the intrahepatic bile ducts.\r"

  ".W": "Although arthrographically demonstrable communications between various compartments of the wrist occur in older persons without symptoms, similar communications in younger persons may indicate clinically significant posttraumatic ligament tears and other pathologic processes. However, detection of communications varies depending on the arthrographic technique used. It has been claimed that if triple-compartment arthrography is not used in all patients, clinically significant unidirectional ligament tears may be overlooked. We determined the frequency and distribution of unidirectional intercompartmental communications, using a modification of techniques described in the literature. Separate injections of contrast material were made in sequence into the midcarpal, distal radioulnar, and radiocarpal joints of 250 consecutive patients. We found 38 unidirectional communications (17 lunotriquetral, nine scapholunate, three radial capsular, one ulnar capsular, six combined sites, and two indeterminate sites) between the midcarpal and radiocarpal joints. Nine unidirectional communications between the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints were found. Comparison of these results with the frequency and direction of unidirectional communications reported by others suggests that demonstration of communications depends on specific technical factors, such as which joint is injected first, the amount of contrast material used, and the delay between injections. This dependence on technical factors raises questions about the value of routine three-compartment wrist arthrography.\r"

Sixty-one children who were restrained passengers in motor vehicle crashes had linear ecchymosis across the abdomen and had CT for abdominal trauma. Thirteen children (21%) had a lumbar spine injury, and 14 children (23%) injured a hollow viscus (bowel, 12; bladder, two); five children (8%) had both spine and hollow viscus injuries. Abnormal findings on abdominal CT were recognized retrospectively in three of 13 children with lumbar spinal injury. Lateral radiographs of the spine showed lumbar spinal injury in all cases. Free intraperitoneal air was noted in on three (25%) of 12 children with bowel injury. In eight of those children, CT showed large, unexplained collections of peritoneal fluid. The presence of lap-belt ecchymosis should prompt a careful search for spine, bowel, and bladder injury. Recognition of the limitations of CT diagnosis of these injuries is important to reduce errors in interpretation.\r"

  ".U": "91263921\r", 
  ".W": "An autostapler is frequently used when bowel is interposed in the urinary tract during reconstructive urologic surgery in children. Usually the metallic staples are buried beneath the intestinal mucosa. However, if a portion of a staple is unintentionally left exposed or becomes exposed through migration and is then bathed by urine, it can become the nidus for formation of a calculus. The radiologic studies of 30 patients having surgery of this type in our hospital from 1980 to 1990 were reviewed prospectively, and stones were found to have developed on staples in eight patients. None of the patients had metabolic abnormalities. The stones were easily visible on plain radiographs because they were calcified. They formed in the lumen of the bladder or the bowel segment on the exposed portion of the staple. Thus, the staple was eccentric in the calculus and not central, as is usually the case with a stone forming on a foreign body. This experience suggests that stones forming on surgical staples during reconstructive urologic surgery have a characteristic radiologic appearance that may aid in their identification.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to establish guidelines for normal splenic size at different ages by using a simple and reproducible sonographic method. Two hundred thirty patients, from neonate to 20-year-old, had sonography because of abdominal and/or pelvic problems unrelated to the spleen. Findings on sonograms of the liver and kidneys were normal in all cases. Splenic size was measured by obtaining a coronal view that included the hilum, while the patient was breathing quietly. The greatest longitudinal distance between the dome of the spleen and the tip (splenic length) was measured and correlated with age, height, and weight. The following guidelines are proposed for the upper limit of normal splenic length based on this simple, easy to use, one-measurement technique: splenic length no greater than 6.0 cm at 3 months, 6.5 cm at 6 months, and 7.0 cm at 12 months, 8.0 cm at 2 years, 9.0 at 4 years, 9.5 cm at 6 years, 10.0 cm at 8 years, 11.0 cm at 10 years, 11.5 cm at 12 years, 12.0 cm at 15 years or older for girls, and 13.0 cm at 15 years or older for boys. Twenty-two patients with known abnormalities of the spleen were randomly selected and their splenic lengths compared with the proposed guidelines; in each case, the length of the spleen exceeded the upper limit of normal for that age. Normal values of a single measurement of the greatest longitudinal diameter of the spleen, from the dome to the tip measured at the hilum in the coronal plane, were obtained in patients from newborn to 20 years old.\r"

  ".W": "The posterior cervical space seen on cross-sectional imaging of the neck constitutes most of the posterior triangle seen on clinical examination. Although triangular anatomy relates best to the surface perspective of the clinician, a spatial approach to anatomy works better for the radiologist viewing axial images. The posterior cervical space is defined as the area in the posterolateral portion of the neck from the skull base to the clavicles deep to the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles but superficial to the prevertebral space. Its principal contents are fat, the spinal accessory nerve, and lymph nodes. We analyzed CT and MR images and clinical records of 63 patients known or suspected to have disease of the posterior cervical space to determine the imaging features that mark a lesion as originating in the posterior cervical space and the spectrum of diseases that arise there. Of the 63 patients in the study, four had clinical pseudomasses, nine had congenital lesions, 10 had inflammatory disease, six had benign tumors, and 34 had malignant tumors. A typical mass lesion of the posterior cervical space was centered within the fat of the space, between the deep and superficial layers of the deep cervical fascia. Characteristic displacements caused by a mass in the posterior cervical space included anteromedial displacement of the carotid space and posteromedial displacement of the prevertebral space. Our study shows that the differential diagnosis of lesions of the posterior cervical space reflects the normal contents of the space, and that diagnosis can thereby be predicted from knowledge of the normal anatomy and contents of the space.\r"

From our experience with more than 600 liver transplants, vascular stenoses have been identified in 10 patients and treated by balloon angioplasty in nine. Three patients with hepatic artery stenosis and deteriorating graft function were treated by balloon angioplasty with a coaxial technique. A specially designed catheter facilitated a successful femoral artery approach. Portal vein stenoses in three patients resulted in portal hypertension. These were treated by balloon dilatation via transhepatic catheterization of the portal vein. Stenoses of the suprahepatic caval anastomosis were dilated in three patients with severe lower limb edema. Technical success was achieved in all three cases of hepatic artery stenosis with improvement in graft function. Recurrent stenoses in two patients were successfully treated with repeated dilatations. Portal hypertension resolved in two of three patients after portal venoplasty. Dilatation of a caval stenosis resulted in the resolution of leg edema in all three cases. Repeated dilatation was required in one case. No reduction in the portal venous pressure gradient occurred after venoplasty in one case, and an ultimately fatal caval thrombosis developed in one patient with caval stenosis before venoplasty could be performed. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty of arterial and venous stenoses complicating hepatic transplantation carries little risk and is a useful procedure for the treatment of these problems.\r"

Hemodynamic responses were monitored, and a standardized questionnaire was given to the patient before, immediately after, and 8-24 hr after the procedure. Physicians also were asked questions after the procedure. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were not significantly different before and 2 min after administration or between groups. A small but significant decrease in blood pressure occurred 2 min after the loading dose was given in both groups. Both drug regimens had statistically significant anxiolytic effects; however, anxiolytic effects were superior in the midazolam/fentanyl group (p less than .02). Patients rated the overall effectiveness of anesthesia with midazolam/fentanyl as superior (p less than .02). Analysis of physicians' judgments of the effectiveness of sedation and analgesia showed a statistically significant advantage for the midazolam/fentanyl group (p less than .01). We conclude that midazolam/fentanyl appears to be as safe as and more efficacious than midazolam alone for sedation and analgesia during lower-extremity angiography.\r"

We compared the biopsy results from palpable vs impalpable, mammographically detected lesions from one experienced breast surgeon's practice from July 1980 through July 1989. Overall, there were 372 biopsies in 346 women. Of 143 biopsies for palpable abnormalities, 48 (34%) yielded a primary malignant lesion. The length of the palpable cancers averaged 3.7 cm (median, 2.8 cm). Sixteen (33%) of the 48 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary lymph nodes, and five (10%) were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. Of 229 biopsies for impalpable, mammographically detected lesions, 72 (31%) yielded a primary breast carcinoma. Excluding 34 carcinomas that had only calcifications, the length of the mammographically detected tumors averaged 2.0 cm (median, 1.5 cm). Eleven (15%) of the 72 biopsies were in patients who had positive axillary nodes, and none were in patients who had distant metastases at the time of biopsy. The positive predictive values (number of cancers detected divided by the number of biopsies recommended) were not significantly different when comparing biopsies indicated for palpable, clinically detected (34%) vs impalpable, mammographically detected (31%) abnormalities (p = .669). However, the mammographically detected cancers were smaller, more often noninvasive (32% vs 4%), less often associated with axillary metastases (15% vs 33%), and without distant metastases (0% vs 10%).\r"

The density determinations made by each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses.\r"

We retrospectively studied 28 patients with choledochocholedochostomy anastomoses who had marked native and donor extrahepatic bile duct dilatation associated with clinical evidence of biliary obstruction. Operative cholangiograms were compared with postoperative cholangiograms obtained a mean of 50 weeks (range, 2-246 weeks) later. Mean caliber of the native common bile duct increased from 7.5 +/- 2.0 mm on operative cholangiograms to 14.8 +/- 3.9 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Mean caliber of the donor common hepatic duct increased from 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm on operative cholangiograms to 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Dilatation of the cystic duct remnant was seen in 15 patients. All patients had surgical revision to choledochojejunostomy with improved results of liver function studies in most cases. Diffuse dilatation of native and donor extrahepatic bile ducts may develop in liver transplant recipients. Typical features include native and donor extrahepatic ducts greater than 12 mm in diameter and a dilated cystic duct remnant on postoperative cholangiography in a patient with otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "91263950\r", 
  ".W": "We describe a simple and inexpensive method of monitoring methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) dissolution of cholesterol gallstones with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in 10 patients. TLC is a routine semiquantitative laboratory method that can be used to measure the cholesterol concentration present in the MTBE and bile mixture aspirated through the cholecystostomy catheter during gallstone dissolution. TLC is practical in the clinical setting because it can be used to determine if gallstone dissolution is occurring and when MTBE lavage is no longer effective. TLC is performed in the laboratory with routine material and is completed in 15 min. Each TLC measurement costs about $1. The procedure provides objective and specific chemical information on effectiveness and progression of gallstone dissolution, apart from the radiologic and sonographic studies. In our study, TLC signaled effective dissolution in the initial phase of gallstone dissolution by detecting large amounts of cholesterol in the MTBE and bile mixture even before a visible change in size or shape of the stone became apparent by transcatheter cholecystography or by sonography (six of 10 patients). Conversely, lack of cholesterol on TLC after 1 hr or more of MTBE infusion indicates that the stones are pigmented or contain substantial calcium. This means that dissolution with MTBE will be ineffective and that solvent infusion should be terminated. In those cases in which dissolution is progressing well, when TLC shows decreasing amounts of cholesterol in the effluent, only residual fragments insoluble to MTBE remain or the stone is sequestered from MTBE; at this point, solvent infusion should be discontinued or the catheter must be repositioned. Monitoring the rate of cholesterol dissolution by TLC provides important complementary information to cholecystography and sonography during gallstone treatment with MTBE.\r"

This study was designed to determine if the administration of intraperitoneal iodinated contrast media would increase the CT detection of such peritoneal metastases. Prospectively, both standard and intraperitoneal contrast-enhanced CT studies of the abdomen and pelvis were performed in 16 patients with suspected gynecologic tumors. All patients then underwent operative staging, with the location and number of metastases documented. The intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies were more sensitive in the detection of peritoneal metastases than standard CT examinations. Whereas routine CT detected peritoneal metastases in seven (64%) of 11 patients with surgically proved implants, the intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies detected peritoneal metastases in all 11 patients. Depending on the specific intraperitoneal compartments involved, the sensitivity of intraperitoneal enhanced CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases was two- to fourfold greater than that of standard CT examinations. Our results suggest that intraperitoneal enhanced CT is superior to standard CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases.\r"

In all cases, the dilated afferent loop was seen on sonography as a tubular structure in the upper abdomen crossing transversely over the midline. The distal end of the afferent loop could be traced toward the anastomosis. The probable cause of the syndrome was predicted on the basis of sonography in two of three patients with cancer at the anastomosis. Our experience suggests that afferent loop syndrome can be diagnosed sonographically on the basis of the detection, location, and shape of the dilated afferent loop.\r"

We evaluated the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy after femoral arteriography in 394 patients by using multiple definitions (different increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen levels at various times). When an increase in the level of serum creatinine of greater than 0.3 mg/dl and greater than 20% on day 1, 2, or 3 and on day 5, 6, or 7 was used to define the disorder, the incidence in our group of patients was 10% for nonazotemic patients vs 30% for azotemic patients (p less than .001); 2% for nondiabetic, nonazotemic patients vs 16% for diabetic, nonazotemic patients (p = .003); and 38% for patients who were both diabetic and azotemic vs 16% for diabetic, nonazotemic patients (p = .022). Baseline renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus (especially when insulin dependent) were significant predisposing factors. The effects of dehydration and increased volume of contrast medium on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy were not clear; the age and sex of the patient were not important risk factors. The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy depends on the definition used. Although contrast-induced nephropathy may develop in any patient, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and, possibly, dehydration and dose of contrast medium are risk factors.\r"

  ".W": "Nephropathy is an established untoward event associated with intravascular administration of conventional high-osmolality contrast media (HOM). It has not been shown previously that lower-osmolality contrast media (LOM) are less nephrotoxic in a clinical setting. We evaluate the ability to replace HOM with LOM (in lower-extremity angiography) to reduce the incidence of nephropathy. We use multiple definitions for contrast-induced nephropathy (six different magnitudes of rise of serum levels of creatinine or blood urea nitrogen in various periods). The incidences of nephrotoxic effects with LOM vs HOM in patients with presumed risk factors, including preexisting renal insufficiency and diabetes, are evaluated also. When all patients are considered, the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy for LOM vs HOM (defined as an increase in serum creatinine level greater than 0.3 mg/dl and greater than 20% on day 1, 2, or 3 and on day 5, 6, or 7, is 7% vs 26% (p = .001). When only patients with preangiography azotemia are considered, the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy for LOM vs HOM is 10% vs 41% (p = .017); for diabetic patients, regardless of preangiography creatinine level, the incidence is 10% vs 31% (p = .012). Although contrast-induced nephropathy may develop even in a patient with no risk factors who receives LOM, LOM is associated with a decreased incidence of this condition, to various degrees, depending on the presence of risk factors.\r"

  ".W": "Transabdominal sonography reliably depicts the cervix during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, but cervical visualization becomes increasingly difficult as the third trimester progresses. To evaluate the possibility of using a perineal approach to bypass the fetus and image the cervix during the third trimester, we used transperineal sonography to image the cervix of 158 third-trimester patients in whom transabdominal visualization was inadequate. The internal os and upper cervix were successfully visualized on transperineal sonograms in all 158 patients, but the region of the external os was obscured by rectal gas in 22 (14%) cases. In some patients in whom the external portion of the cervix was obscured by bowel gas, the problem could be overcome by scanning with the patient in the lateral decubitus position or by rotating the patient. Transperineal sonography is an effective technique for imaging the cervix during the third trimester of pregnancy, allowing cervical visualization in most patients in whom transabdominal sonography of this area is unsuccessful.\r"

Selective ostial salpingography was performed in those in whom the fallopian tubes did not fill on the second hysterosalpingogram. Patients referred from three infertility clinics were included in the study if they could be rescheduled for a second hysterosalpingogram after at least 1 week of preparation with aspirin. Hysterosalpingograms obtained after administration of aspirin showed normal filling in 21 of 100 patients with initially obstructed tubes; the tubes filled in four more patients after administration of terbutaline. Selective ostial salpingography opacified the tubes in another 36 patients in whom the tubes had so far failed to fill. On the basis of the radiographic appearance and sometimes laparoscopic observation, initial nonfilling was attributed to spasma and debris in 49 patients, submucosal fibroids in six, synechiae in three, salpingitis isthmica nodosa in two, and septated uterus in one. Hysterosalpingography, after pharmacologic manipulation with aspirin and/or selective ostial salpingography, revealed false-positive and functional tube obstructions in 61 of 100 patients. Moreover, the radiologic appearance improved categorization of organic obstructions.\r"

MR examinations from 30 patients were interpreted by two observers using film displayed both on a standard film panel alternator and an eight-screen digital workstation. Arthroscopic examination of these patients disclosed 30 meniscal tears and five anterior cruciate ligament tears in 28 patients. Two patients had normal arthroscopic examinations. The MR examinations were evaluated with a five-point confidence rating scale. Results were correlated with arthroscopic findings, and receiver-operating-characteristic curves were generated from these data. No significant difference was found between the areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves for film and digital display. The time required for image interpretation was greater when using the digital workstation than when using the film by a factor of approximately 2.7. Our data indicate that a multiscreen digital workstation can be used for interpreting MR examinations of the knee without impairment of diagnostic performance, but with increased time required for image interpretation when compared with radiographic film and a film panel alternator.\r"

Constant flow velocities generated in a phantom (range, 20-408 cm/sec) were determined correctly by VEC MR (r = .997, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 7.9 cm/sec). Peak systolic velocities in the main pulmonary artery determined by VEC MR correlated well with the measurements obtained by using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography (r = .91). Stroke volumes measured at the aorta by VEC MR and continuous-wave Doppler imaging also correlated well with each other (r = .80). VEC MR measurements of aortic and pulmonary flow provided left and right ventricular stroke volumes that correlated well with left ventricular stroke volumes determined by short-axis cine MR images (r = .98, SEE = 3.7 ml, and r = .95, SEE = 4.8 ml, respectively). Intra- and interobserver variabilities were small for both left and right ventricular stroke volumes as measured with VEC MR. These results indicate that VEC MR accurately and reproducibly measures aortic and pulmonary flow velocities and volumes in the physiologic range of humans, and can be used to measure right and left ventricular stroke volumes under normal flow conditions.\r"

The accuracy of MR imaging in estimating overall body fatness and regional fat distribution at individual landmarks was determined by comparing it with well-accepted measures by deuterium-oxide (D2O) dilution and bioimpedance analysis. Fourteen normal young women (athletes and control subjects) were studied. A total of 308 axial, T1-weighted, spin-echo MR images over a specific region in the trunk (21-24 scans per subject) were obtained. Morphometric computer image analysis was performed to determine the subcutaneous, internal, and total fat volumes in each image. The data were analyzed in two ways: data from all slices were summed to assess overall body fatness, and six anatomic landmarks were chosen for regional comparisons. MR-determined estimates of overall body fatness strongly correlated with total body fat measures by D2O dilution in both total fat (r = .91) and subcutaneous fat (r = .92) determinations. Athletes in both the low- and high-intensity training phases had significantly lower values of MR-determined total body fatness than did control subjects. Parallel to total body fatness, athletes had significantly lower MR-determined ratios of total fat/total volume in four of six individual landmarks compared with control subjects. Our experience suggests that MR is an accurate method to quantify overall body fatness, when compared with D2O dilution and bioimpedance analysis. MR could also discriminate regional components of subcutaneous and internal body fat at individual landmarks.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with congestive heart failure, down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors is present, probably as a result of sympathetic overstimulation. In end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-adrenoceptor density is markedly reduced, while beta 2-adrenoceptor density is normal. This latter finding does not necessarily imply normal sensitivity to beta 2-stimulation, due to possible alterations in the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylate cyclase complex beyond the receptor. In some disease states, such as ischemic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve disease, there seems to be a concomitant reduction of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. The finding of beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation has stimulated the search for novel therapeutic approaches in heart failure patients. Beta-agonists could even further down-regulate beta receptors, and this perhaps explains why they seem not to be useful in long-term use. Agents that directly stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, such as forskolin, or that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate degradation, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are being tested. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were used in treatment of heart failure before beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation was recognized in these patients. It is tempting to speculate that the beneficial clinical and hemodynamic effects seen in these patients treated with metoprolol is indeed due to an antagonism of the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation. Studies testing whether beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents can improve survival in congestive heart failure patients are on-going.\r"

We investigated matching of the ventricular properties, quantified by the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, with arterial load properties, expressed by the slope of end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relationship. In normal subjects, with ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 60%, ventricular elastance was nearly twice as large as arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal mechanical efficiency. In patients with moderate heart failure, with ejection fraction of 40-59%, ventricular elastance was almost equal to arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal stroke work from a given end-diastolic volume. In patients with severe heart failure, with ejection fraction of less than 40%, ventricular elastance was less than half of arterial elastance, which resulted in increased potential energy and decreased work efficiency. Ventriculoarterial coupling is normally set toward higher left ventricular work efficiency, whereas in patients with moderate cardiac dysfunction, ventricular and arterial properties are matched, in order to maximize stroke work at the expense of work efficiency. Neither the stroke work nor work efficiency is near maximum for patients with severe cardiac dysfunction.\r"

Increasing attention has recently been paid to compensatory and adaptive mechanisms occurring after the initial insult. Thus, new insights have been gained into the pathophysiology of contraction of hypertrophied myocardium and changes of adrenergic receptors in the myocardium due to chronically increased cardiac sympathetic tone. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in early and advanced congestive heart failure has been further elucidated, and the role of the vasodilating atrial natriuretic peptide is undergoing further definition. New results further clarify the mechanisms leading to breathlessness and muscular fatigue in congestive heart failure, with emphasis shifting from the traditional concept of the importance of increased filling pressures to changes to the peripheral circulation and exercising muscles. Although progress has been made in understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, many aspects are still poorly understood and await clarification.\r"

  ".W": "This review discusses the localization of adrenergic- and dopaminergic-adrenoceptors within the cardiovascular system and describes the cardiovascular and renal changes produced following the activation of these receptors by appropriate agonists. Whereas the role of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents in the treatment of heart failure is well recognized, recent studies with dopamine (DA)-receptor agonists indicate that they offer a novel approach in the therapy of congestive heart failure. DA-adrenoceptor agonists reduce afterload by causing vasodilation and promote sodium excretion via direct activation of DA1-adrenoceptors located on renal tubules. Fenoldopam is a selective DA1-adrenoceptor agonist found to be effective in heart failure. It reduces afterload by causing peripheral vasodilation and produces natriuresis and diuresis. Dopexamine is a DA1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, and its efficacy in heart failure is due to its ability to provide mild inotropic support and cause a reduction in afterload. Ibopamine is a prodrug that is converted into its active metabolite, epinine. This compound activates primarily DA1- and DA2-adrenoceptors. It is effective in heart failure, and the mechanism progresses via DA1- and DA2-adrenoceptor-mediated reduction in afterload. Agonists of DA2-adrenoceptors reduce afterload by decreasing the release of norepinephrine and by reducing the levels of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Since both of these systems are active in heart failure, ibopamine offers a rational approach for therapy. The present review addresses the concept of pharmacologic intervention in adrenergic and dopaminergic influence in the cardiovascular and renal systems to produce changes that are desirable for the pharmacotherapy of congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "91263995\r", 
  ".W": "In congestive heart failure, peripheral adaptive mechanisms play a significant and largely underestimated role. In acute heart failure, sympathetic-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction together with chronotropic and inotropic actions serves to maintain perfusion pressure and blood supply to the vital organs. In chronic heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin system increases peripheral vascular resistance and arterial tone and decreases arterial compliance and vasodilator capacity. Endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent vasodilation is reduced as a consequence of reduced blood flow. Deconditioning renders the blood vessels incapable of dilating in response to increased flow. Simultaneously, reduced blood flow and inactivity are induced by deconditioning, with functional and structural consequences within the skeletal muscle. Exercise performance is limited by reduced overall blood flow, reduced conductance of the feeding arteries, elevated tone of the resistance vessels, reduced vasodilator capacity, impaired dissipation of heat from the working muscle, and functional and structural changes of the skeletal muscle due to underperfusion and inactivity. The adaptive mechanisms operate at different time scales. Under therapeutic intervention, their reversibility also follows different time constants. Restoration of the vasodilator capacity of the large arteries and of the abnormalities of skeletal muscle in heart failure requires time. Vasodilation with reduced pre- and/or afterload will retard progression of the superimposed ventricular dilation and hypertrophy, and therefore retard the progress of the disease. However, restoration of the peripheral blood flow and of organ function will require time. Restoration of the vascular compliance and of the full amplitude of adaptive flow-dependent vasodilation in the large arteries requires weeks or months. Similarly, restoration of functionally and morphologically altered skeletal muscle can be expected to be reversible over a longer time period.\r"

The prevalence of various forms of heart block, bradycardias, and arrhythmias in heart failure is largely unknown, as is their relationship to the etiology of the syndrome. Complex and multiform ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are common, and their frequency is broadly related to the severity of heart failure. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common features of the syndrome. The heart failure syndrome has an ominous prognosis. Approximately half the patients die suddenly, but the causal relationship between preexisting arrhythmias and sudden death is not known. Equally vital is knowledge of the influence of drug therapy on the arrhythmias of heart failure, but at present this is scarce and needs further study.\r"

A secondary objective is to do so at the lowest possible economic cost. When treatment of the cause of heart failure is possible--which usually means some form of surgery, but could include treatment of a primary disease, such as thyrotoxicosis--then this is obviously the treatment of choice. In patients for whom there is no such definitive treatment, a wide and increasing variety of drugs are available. When new antifailure drugs are to be developed there are therefore two problems: first, to ensure that they are more effective than placebo treatment, and second, to compare them with existing drugs. Both of these tests can present ethical difficulties, for it is unreasonable to withhold established effective treatment in order to conduct a placebo-controlled trial, and when drugs are being compared, it is unlikely that any new medication will be dramatically superior to an old one. The more effective the treatments already available, the harder it becomes to evaluate a new drug.\r"

As a result, it reduces systemic vascular resistance, increases cardiac output, and increases renal flow. Ibopamine also modulates the neuroendocrine reflexes in heart failure; plasma renin activity and norepinephrine and aldosterone plasma concentrations are reduced, both immediately and during sustained administration. Ibopamine has proved to be safe in many thousands of heart failure patients during long-term therapy.

To test the hypothesis that a provocative test for uterine contractility at the beginning of the third trimester would reliably identify patients destined to be delivered before and at term, we designed the mammary stimulation test. Uterine contractions in response to nipple stimulation at a mean of 28.6 weeks' gestation, were evaluated in 94 gravid patients at risk for preterm delivery. The mammary stimulation test, the results of which were not used for clinical management, was positive in 50% of patients tested and had a sensitivity of 84% and a positive predictive value of 34% (chi 2 = 11.15, p less than 0.01). Ninety-four percent of patients predicted to be delivered at term actually were delivered at term (negative predictive value). Furthermore, no patients with a negative mammary stimulation test were delivered within 1 month of testing or were delivered of infants weighing less than 2000 gm. Discriminant analysis indicated that the mammary stimulation test provided information beyond that available from clinical risk factors alone. A cost analysis suggested that the use of the mammary stimulation test could reduce the cost of ambulatory uterine activity monitoring by nearly 50%. If these findings can be validated in additional samples, the mammary stimulation test may be useful in prematurity prevention programs.\r"

  ".W": "Few studies have addressed the significance of umbilical artery pulsed Doppler velocimetry in multiple gestation. Level II ultrasonography and pulsed Doppler studies were performed in 94 twin pairs and seven sets of triplets, which yielded data on 207 fetuses. A systolic/diastolic ratio was calculated for each fetus; abnormal pulsed Doppler velocimetry showed high correlation with adverse pregnancy events. Those with abnormal Doppler findings tended to be born 3 to 4 weeks earlier and to exhibit a greater number of stillbirths and structural malformations, as well as greater morbidity, when compared with fetuses without abnormal Doppler results. Fifteen of 17 infants with abnormal antenatal waveforms suffered serious morbidity. Seven were small for gestational age, and two were borderline for small for gestational age. An additional five infants with abnormal waveforms were appropriate for gestational age but were either recipient or donor in the twin transfusion syndrome. Eleven fetuses with this syndrome are described. Donor twins tended to be severely small for gestational age, with 7 of the 11 infants showing elevated systolic/diastolic ratios. Amniotic fluid volume tended to be diminished in the donor's sac but normal or increased in the recipient's sac. The observations in the study correlate with suspected physiologic changes of this syndrome. Because present findings suggest that fetuses with abnormal velocimetry suffer increased morbidity and mortality, a more rational method of management that uses Doppler data is suggested for multiple gestations.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of descriptor indices for the umbilical arterial Doppler waveform are currently in use for predicting perinatal outcome. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the relative diagnostic merits of these indices. We addressed this issue in a prospective, blind study in which the diagnostic efficacy of the following Doppler indices was compared: resistance index, systolic/diastolic ratio, pulsatility index, and diastolic average ratio. The analytic technique consisted of the receiver operating characteristic method, which evaluates a test's ability to discriminate a diseased from a healthy population. The patient population consisted of 350 pregnant patients with gestational ages of 34 to 36 weeks. A continuous-wave Doppler device with a 4 MHz transducer was used to investigate the umbilical vessels. The test was performed only once in each patient. The abnormal outcome parameters included small for gestational age (less than 10th percentile), Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes, fetal distress (late and severe variable decelerations, absent variability, fetal scalp pH less than 7.20), umbilical cord arterial pH less than 7.10, presence of thick meconium, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (greater than 48 hours). The results showed that the resistance index had the best discriminatory ability when compared with other Doppler indices: the systolic/diastolic ratio (p less than 0.05), the pulsatility index (p less than 0.001), and the diastolic/average ratio (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that of the various Doppler indices assessed in this investigation, the resistance index offers the best diagnostic efficacy in predicting perinatal compromise.\r"

The choices of 167 women and the judgments of their obstetricians were longitudinally recorded during the antepartum and intrapartum course. Patients routinely received the patient guide of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for vaginal birth after cesarean section. Ultimately, 50% of patients who were encouraged by their obstetrician toward vaginal birth after cesarean section opted for an elective repeat cesarean section without a trial of labor. Reasons for patient resistance are enumerated and potential future remedial proposals are discussed.\r"

In 1989 we reported the first successful pregnancy, in the United States, after transferring sperm and oocyte into the peritoneal cavity. We now report the results of a prospective study of this procedure. Twelve women with unexplained infertility underwent 23 cycles of peritoneal ovum-sperm transfer. Ovulation stimulation was achieved with human menopausal gonadotropin. Ultrasonographically directed oocyte recovery was performed by the transvaginal route with the patient under local anesthesia and sedation. After oocyte recovery, 4.5 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SE) oocytes and 13.3 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SE) x 10(6) motile spermatozoa were transferred into the pouch of Douglas. Six clinical pregnancies occurred in 23 stimulated cycles for a pregnancy rate of 26% per cycle. This value compares with the overall pregnancy rates of 16% for in vitro fertilization and 27% for gamete intrafallopian transfer reported by the In Vitro Fertilization Registry. Thus these preliminary data suggest that peritoneal ovum-sperm transfer is at least as successful as in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer. Advantages of peritoneal ovum-sperm transfer over gamete intrafallopian transfer include its being an office nonsurgical procedure not necessitating a general anesthetic and decreased cost. Therefore peritoneal ovum-sperm transfer is a reasonable first approach in couples with unexplained infertility.\r"

Analysis of interrelationships among antithrombin III by activity method, oral contraceptive type, and ABO blood group showed larger declines in antithrombin III for type O women using the highest estrogen dose preparation (31.6%) and for non-type O women using the lowest progestin dose preparation (38.9%).

  ".W": "Criticism of the Papanicolaou smear in the lay press and recent federal legislation regulating cytology laboratories indicate a need to reappraise cervical cancer screening programs. This study directly compares three potential screening tests, used alone or in combination. A total of 1012 women aged 18 to 35 years were screened by cytologic testing, cervicography, and hybridization for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid, with discrepancies being referred by the last two authors. After findings from the entire lower genital tract were combined, 116 women (11.5%) showed definite clinical abnormalities (either exophytic vulvovaginal condylomas or cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions). Another 72 (7.2%) had positive Southern blot hybridizations without accompanying viral expression, yielding a cumulative frequency for established disease or latent infection of 18.6%. When associated vulvovaginal condylomas are disregarded, final groupings with regard to cervical pathologic classification were: 23 high-grade and 71 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 164 cases of equivocal atypia (34 of which had detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid), and 754 cases with negative results (38 of which had detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid). Cervical screening tests were compared principally by plotting increasingly liberal recall criteria onto receiver operating characteristic curves (i.e., graphs of true-positive results on the Y axis versus false-positive results on the X axis). Used individually, each screening test was valid, but none was substantially better than the others. No matter how liberal the recall criteria, no single test was able to detect all of the 23 definite precursors in this sample. Applying conventional recall criteria (i.e., high- or low-grade lesion suspected), cytologic testing alone detected 12 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (52.2%), at a cost of having to perform colposcopy in 8.7% of the sample. Combining all three tests and setting the end point as just a high-positive result by at least one test, 19 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (83%) were detected, with a recall of 7%. Optimal test performance (96% sensitivity, 4% recall) would have been attained by recalling all patients with high-grade cytologic results or positive cervicography results, plus any patients with low-grade morphologic atypia in which hybridization detected an oncogenic human papillomavirus type. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) Cytologic detection rates are markedly improved by a second or third test; (2) increased screening costs could be offset by not recalling patients with minor lesions with no apparent potential for progression.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1974 to March 1988, 150 patients with primary invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent surgery at Indiana University. There has been a trend toward more conservative surgical management of this disease. To determine the impact of this trend on clinical outcome, cases were divided into three groups according to date of operation: group I, 1974 to 1978; group II, 1979 to 1983; and group III, 1984 to 1988. Overall, 80 patients had en bloc radical vulvectomy and groin dissection, 20 had modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection through three separate incisions, and 36 had modified radical vulvectomy and unilateral superficial groin dissection. Fourteen patients had other operations. Forty-two patients (27.3%) had radiotherapy in addition to surgery. Among the three groups, there were no differences when mean age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution (1988 system), mean lesion size, mean depth of invasion, or grade distribution were compared. A significant trend toward more conservative surgical therapy was observed. En bloc radical vulvectomy was performed in 77.4% of group I patients, 71.1% of group II patients, and 35.8% of group III patients (p less than 0.001). Mean days of hospitalization were also reduced significantly. Group I had a mean stay of 30 days, group II had a mean stay of 23 days, and group III had a mean stay of 11 days (p less than 0.001). Mean operative blood loss (group I, 754.8 ml; group II, 620.0 ml; group III, 393.6 ml; p = 0.03), mean units of blood transfused (group I, 1.4 units; group II, 1.3 units; group III, 0.4 units; p less than 0.01), and mean hours of operating time (group I, 3.7 hours; group II, 3.7 hours; group III, 3.2 hours; p = 0.02) were also reduced.\r"

In this study we have developed gestational age curves for fetal blood amino acids and carnitine that now allow the development of a new parameter, the fetal concentrating index, which is the numeric mean of the fetal/maternal ratio of six essential and nonessential concentrated amino acids. Our data have shown that this index does not vary with gestation in either normal pregnancies (1.83 +/- 0.42, mean +/- SD) or pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation (1.46 +/- 0.38), but the index is markedly reduced in intrauterine growth retardation (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that, because cordocentesis has become very safe in experienced hands, cordocentesis to obtain the fetal concentrating index might ethically be obtained in cases of fetuses at risk for intrauterine growth retardation, to devise strategies for intervention before the onset of severe hypoxia and morphometric changes.\r"

Despite considerable patient variation, most gravid women with HELLP syndrome had decreasing platelet counts until 24 to 48 hours after delivery. Conversely, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations usually peaked 24 to 48 hours post partum. In all patients who recovered, a platelet count greater than 1,000,000/mm3 was spontaneously achieved by the sixth postpartum day or within 72 hours of platelet nadir. An upward trend in platelet count and a downward trend in lactate dehydrogenase concentrations should be apparent in patients without complications by the fourth postpartum day. These data provide baseline information against which the course of individual patients can be compared and the infrequent, atypical case identified for interventive therapy.\r"

The overall cumulative 5-year survival was 89%. The clinical characteristics included mean age 44.6 years, nulliparity 10%, married 93%, obese 38%, hypertension 32%, diabetes mellitus 5%, smoking 54%, symptoms of bleeding 68%, positive cytologic smear 83%. Lymph nodes were diseased in 45 of 261 (17%) with 26 unilateral (10%) and 19 bilateral (7%). Tumor differentiation showed: grade 1, 112 (33%); grade 2, 144 (42%); grade 3, 86 (25%). Factors that did not influence survival included age, presence or absence of positive cervical cytologic smear, the interval from previous papanicolaou smear, hypertension, smoking history, patient's blood type, and transfusion at radical hysterectomy. In all patients survival was significantly influenced by the following features: tumor classified as well differentiated (95%) or poorly differentiated (82%); tumor size less than 3 cm (91%) or greater than 3 cm (76%); negative lymph nodes (93%) or positive lymph nodes (61%). When three or fewer lymph nodes were involved, the survival was 79% compared with 33% when four or more lymph nodes were involved. In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival was significantly influenced by the amount of residual cervical disease: no residual disease, 100%; less than 50% penetration, 96%; greater than 50% penetration, 83%. Involvement of the lower uterine segment reduced survival to 73% compared with 95% when the lower segment was uninvolved. One hundred seventeen patients without angiolymphatic invasion had a 97% cumulative 5-year survival whereas 70 patients without disease in the lymph nodes but with angiolymphatic invasion had an 88% cumulative 5-year survival rate. A Cox model, multiple proportional hazard analysis was performed for all patients, and the factors that influenced survival included tumor grade, tumor size, presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes, and diabetes mellitus. In patients undergoing radiation therapy, the tumor grade and size were significant factors in survival. In patients undergoing radical hysterectomy, survival was influenced by the depth of cervical penetration and lower uterine segment involvement whereas the tumor grade, tumor size, patient's age, and removal of ovaries were not significant.\r"

Eighty-five of the 129 women also had an additional study including x-ray hysterosalpingography and/or chromopertubation. Of these 85 women, 58 had pelviscopic examination with chromopertubation. The frequency of diagnosis of tubal occlusion was compared among the three methods.

The frequency of comparable findings between x-ray hysterosalpingography and chromopertubation is 75%. These data suggest that ultrasonography-hysterosalpingography is at least as accurate as x-ray hysterosalpingography in diagnosing tubal occlusion. In addition, ultrasonography-hysterosalpingography is safer and more cost-effective than x-ray hysterosalpingography and chromopertubation.\r"

No differences were seen in 17 obstetric, medical, and environmental-behavioral high-risk factors between symmetric and asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation. In preeclampsia, the incidence of symmetric intrauterine growth retardation is higher than that of asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation. The timing of the interaction between the high-risk factor and the stage of gestation is more important than the specific high-risk factor in determining whether symmetric or asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation is produced. On comparison of perinatal outcome between the two groups, we concluded: (1) that the onset of symmetric intrauterine growth retardation occurs much earlier in the course of pregnancy than does asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation, (2) that more symmetric than asymmetric pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation result in preterm delivery, (3) that the neonatal morbidity rate for symmetric intrauterine growth retardation is higher than that for asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation, and (4) that term symmetric infants with intrauterine growth retardation tend to have a lower mean birth weight and a higher incidence of small placentas than term infants with asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

Forty-eight of the 50 reported cases have occurred in women, nearly all in association with pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and untreated, it can progress to pituitary insufficiency and death. Histologic studies show characteristic changes of autoimmune disease with lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of anterior pituitary tissue with fibrotic replacement. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is currently diagnosed after other pituitary mass lesions are excluded and has been treated with a combination of neurosurgery and end-organ hormone replacement. However, with improved knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics and natural history of the disease and with the ability to make a prospective diagnosis, we believe glucocorticoids may suppress the inflammatory response and protect remaining pituitary tissue. Two previously unreported pregnancy-associated cases are described, including one prospectively diagnosed and treated without neurosurgery during pregnancy. Obstetrician-gynecologists must place lymphocytic adenohypophysitis in the differential diagnosis of pituitary enlargement associated with pregnancy, since treatment is available and the sequelae may be life-threatening.\r"

  ".U": "91264037\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred nineteen patients with tuboovarian abscess were evaluated for response to antibiotics. Results were stratified into three groups by antimicrobial regimen. Group 1 consisted of 37 patients treated with a single-agent broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic and oral doxycycline. Initial clinical response (defined as decreased pain, diminished white blood cell count, or defervescence) in group 1 was 31/37 (84%). Group 2 consisted of 64 patients treated with clindamycin in combination with an aminoglycoside with or without a penicillin. There was an initial clinical response in 45 of 64 (70%). Group 3 consisted of 18 patients from group 1 who were changed to a clindamycin-containing regimen after 2 to 3 days of initial treatment with a single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotic. The decision to switch antibiotics was not based on treatment failure but occurred when delayed ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of tuboovarian abscess. The switch reflected physician preference for clindamycin-containing regimens in the treatment of tuboovarian abscesses. The response rate in this subset of patients was 14 of 18 (78%). Overall initial clinical response rate was 90 of 119 (75%). There were no statistically significant demographic or clinical differences among the three groups. There was no statistical difference in the rate of early and late antibiotic failure rates among the groups. Our study demonstrates that extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefoxitin, in conjunction with doxycycline has efficacy that is equivalent to that of clindamycin-containing regimens. An overall medical treatment success rate of 75% suggests that conservative treatment of tuboovarian abscesses is warranted.\r"

Although this is considered accepted practice, there are little data available to help the clinician know when to start testing. To help answer this question in patients with chronic hypertension and nonproteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension, we reviewed the results of all antepartum tests between 1976 and 1987 in patients with these diagnoses. The primary mode of surveillance in the majority of our patients was the contraction stress test. We determined when patients first had positive contraction stress test results and when intervention occurred because of an abnormal antepartum test result. There were a total of 917 patients tested with these diagnoses. Fifty-three (5.8%) of these patients had at least one positive contraction stress test result. Twenty-two patients were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation because of abnormal antepartum test results. Those with early intervention (less than 35 weeks' gestation) could not be differentiated from those with later intervention (greater than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation) by maternal age, diastolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure at the time of testing. The majority of patients who were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation had a concomitant diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, intrauterine growth retardation, diabetes mellitus, or superimposed preeclampsia. On the basis of when compromise was evident, patients with these diagnoses may require testing to be started as early as the fetus is considered viable. However, in those without these diagnoses, the clinician may delay the beginning of testing until 33 weeks' gestation without significant risk of pregnancy loss before testing.\r"

Diagnoses made by ultrasonography included incorrect fetal dating, multiple gestation, fetal death, open neural tube defect, abdominal wall defect, placental abnormalities, cystic hygroma, renal anomalies, and oligohydramnios. Optimal prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies also requires the use of amniocentesis in many patients. Amniocentesis may be obviated if fetal dating is incorrect, if an unsuspected multiple gestation is discovered, or if there is a clear anomaly and the parents do not desire genetic counseling based on karyotype information. If the fetus appears normal, the ultrasonographic results are equivocal, or the parents desire more detailed genetic counseling when an anomaly is found by ultrasonography, then amniocentesis should be performed. Thirteen abnormalities were diagnosed by amniocentesis alone in this group.\r"

Seventy-three cycles (64%) were adequate for oocyte retrieval. In 41 cycles (36%) hyperstimulation was discontinued. The serum 17 beta-estradiol value in women with a poor response was 57 +/- 50 pg/ml on day 8 compared with 376 +/- 334 pg/ml in the women who completed in vitro fertilization (p less than 0.05). The majority of women (84.2%) had a prompt response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation after short-term oral contraceptive suppression. Most discontinuations were due to dominant follicle selection or luteinizing hormone surge and not to oversuppression by short-term oral contraceptives.

The endometriomas ranged from 2 to 9.2 cm in diameter by preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography. The operative procedure used was a three-puncture technique with a 600 micron fiber attached to a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The power setting was 10 W with a continuous pulse. In all cases endometriomas were opened, drained, and irrigated, and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser was used to vaporize or remove the entire cyst lining. The ovarian edges were inverted with the laser at the end of the procedure. With one exception, there was no recurrence of endometrioma at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography or laparoscopy. In one case, 4 months after the initial laparoscopic procedure, exploratory laparotomy was performed for resection of a large, recurrent endometrioma. The use of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser allows the laparoscopic surgeon an aggressive approach to ovarian endometriomas that in the past necessitated exploratory laparotomy.\r"

Inevitably, there will be an increased number of women recipients who later undergo pregnancy. Although there is a wide experience with pregnancy after renal transplantation, there are as yet relatively few reports of pregnancy after other major organ transplants. A case is presented of a 22-year-old primiparous woman who elected to conceive and complete a pregnancy 2 years after cardiac transplantation because of cardiomyopathy. The pregnancy was complicated by a rejection episode early in the third trimester but eventually resulted in forceps delivery of a live male infant at 41 weeks' gestation. The pregnancy and organ transplantation literature is reviewed with special attention, illustrated by the case report, to the physiologic adaptation to pregnancy of the transplanted organ, the potential teratogenic effects of the immunosuppressive drugs used in pregnancy, and the contrasts between renal and other major organ transplants.\r"

The transabdominal route is beneficial in treating patients with cervices that are either extremely short, congenitally deformed, deeply lacerated, or markedly scarred because of previously failed transvaginal cerclage procedures. The average gestational age at surgery was 11.5 weeks and the operation was performed after early ultrasonographic verification of fetal viability. Patients with advanced cervical effacement or dilatation in the second trimester were excluded. A 5 mm wide Mersilene band was applied in an avascular space above the junction of the cervix and the uterine isthmus without dissection or tunneling among broad ligament vessels. This simplified surgical approach resulted in little operative blood loss (mean, 75 ml; range, 50 to 200 ml). After transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage, 21 pregnancies in 20 patients resulted in 18 term births, one premature birth with favorable outcome, and two early fetal deaths (90% salvage rate). A review of the world literature indicated 130 pregnancies with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage during pregnancy and a cumulative success rate of 89%. Preconceptional transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage was reported in 30 pregnancies with an overall fetal survival rate of 81%. A survey of specialists in maternal-fetal medicine indicated an increasing interest and familiarity with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage since its introduction more than two decades ago although this procedure is still not widely applied in obstetric practice.\r"

Once a definite diagnosis is established by physical examination, fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing, and mammography, is it prudent to monitor women with small fibroadenomas (less than 4 cm in diameter)? We reviewed 498 cases of biopsy-proved fibroadenomas and 17 cases of phyllodes tumors (by biopsy) seen at Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center from 1986 to 1989. Analysis of patient age and measured tumor size in 203 fibroadenomas and 10 phyllodes tumor specimens revealed similar ranges for both tumors. The mean values were 28.5 years and 2.3 cm for fibroadenomas and 44 years and 3.8 cm for phyllodes tumors. No cases of coincident carcinoma within a fibroadenoma or of metastatic malignant phyllodes tumors were present in this review. As an alternative to excising all breast tumors, cytologically diagnosed fibroadenomas can be monitored, because they have no intrinsic premalignant potential and tend to regress with time. All breast tumors that rapidly increase in size should probably be excised at any age.\r"

The hospital courses and anthropomorphic, developmental, and neurologic development of 201 infants exposed to one or more beta-sympathomimetic agents (isoxsuprine, 33; ritodrine, 70; terbutaline, 43; combination, 55) were analyzed and compared with those of 130 control infants of similar birth weight. One hundred and seventy-seven infants had follow-up to 1 year of age, 101 to age 3, and 58 to age 4. When treatments consisting of a single beta-sympathomimetic or no treatment were compared, there were no statistically significant overall differences found in growth and development or in most of the short-term measures of infant well-being. However, significant overall differences with no evidence of confounding by time-related effects were found for the following; mortality, none greater than terbutaline; maximum positive inspiratory pressure when respiratory distress syndrome was present, none greater than terbutaline; neonatal trauma, terbutaline greater than ritodrine. Other differences were found in conjunction with evidence of time-related confounding, or within specific time intervals. It should be noted that these differences are not necessarily due to effects of the different treatments, as the data are observational.\r"

The ability to have regular spontaneous menstrual cycles and to conceive was assessed after a follow-up period of 10 years. Patients who had been classified as having hypothalamic pituitary \"failure\" (hypoestrogenic amenorrhea) with low levels of circulating estradiol had a greater rate of recovery of spontaneous ovulation and menses when compared with patients who had been classified as having only hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction (euestrogenic amenorrhea). The patients with diagnosis of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation or polycystic ovary syndrome generally required clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation and almost all the patients with premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea) remained estrogen-deficient and unable to ovulate. Hyperprolactinemia or an identifiable pituitary adenoma has not developed in any of the patients to date.\r"

A prospective comparison was carried out on 97 consecutive adult patients whose severity of illness was scored one hour after admission using both the Clinical Sickness Score and APACHE II. Intensive Therapy Unit and hospital outcomes were recorded for each patient. The Clinical Sickness Score and APACHE II identified survivors and nonsurvivors with similar power (p less than 0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between the two scoring systems for hospital survivors and nonsurvivors together (r = 0.5418, r2 = 0.28, p = less than 0.0001) and for hospital survivors alone (r = 0.6102, r2 = 0.37, p = 0.0001). Correlation for hospital nonsurvivors was not significant (r = 0.1629, r2 = 0.027, p = 0.3134). The positive predictive values of APACHE II were between 5% and 10% more sensitive than the Clinical Sickness Score for hospital outcome. Admission Clinical Sickness Score and APACHE II scores had similar predictive power in this study.\r"

At one hour postoperatively the thiopentone group showed impaired visual-motor coordination on the aiming test (p less than 0.01) and dexterity task (p less than 0.05), and a slowing of reaction time (p less than 0.01). Patients given propofol showed only an increase in reaction time (p less than 0.05). By 2 hours the thiopentone group showed impairment only in the aiming task (p less than 0.05). No further significant impairment was detected at 4, 24 or 48 hours. However, patients reported symptoms throughout the 48 hours indicative of residual drug effects. There was a substantial practice effect with some tests which may have obscured impairment. It can be argued therefore that the better recovery profile after propofol is still evident at 24 hours.\r"

The recovery times to a train-of-four ratio of 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9 were recorded. In patients given neostigmine, antagonism was at an average T1 of between 8.8% and 14.9%. There was no difference in the recovery times between the patients given neostigmine 35 micrograms/kg, 55 micrograms/kg or 75 micrograms/kg. Recovery after neostigmine 15 micrograms/kg was significantly slower than after the higher doses. One patient given neostigmine 75 micrograms/kg showed an unusual bimodal pattern of recovery.

The most significant outdoor source of this chemical is gasoline and diesel fuel combustion. The primary indoor source is combustion of tobacco products. Formaldehyde is associated with a disagreeable odor that can produce \"annoyance\" symptoms and at higher concentrations can be a transient and completely reversible irritant to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. It is so soluble and rapidly metabolized that it rarely reaches the lower respiratory tract to inflict damage. The exception is in cigarette smokers who actively inhale. Formaldehyde may on rare occasions induce bronchial asthma at relatively high exposure doses. There are no conclusive studies that prove the development of de novo IgE-mediated respiratory tract symptoms secondary to inhalation of formaldehyde vapors. The approach to formaldehyde-induced symptoms should be one of careful documentation of objective physiologic changes.\r"

We had the unique opportunity to study the results of a prolonged exposure to TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-P-dioxin) in rhesus monkeys and their offspring. Subsequently, we performed similar studies on humans exposed to the nematode pesticide, Aldicarb. This report summarizes those previous studies. In the monkeys, no major deficits of the immune system were found and the animals did not have excessive numbers of infections. However, at higher doses of dietary TCDD (25 ppt), only 22% of the offspring survived to 1 year of age. Thus, the failure to demonstrate effects on the young may simply relate to the essential equivalence of the lethal to an immunosuppressive dose. In humans, exposure to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Aldicarb, was received through contaminated well water. The known exposure was for at least 1 year and could have been as long as 5 years. Various tests of the immune system, including lymphocyte subset counts, proliferative responses, total immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody responses did not reveal immunodeficiency. Increases in the numbers of CD8 positive T lymphocytes was observed. There was no evidence of any increase in clinical illness in the exposed compared with the control group.\r"

The lowered incidence of DTH scores in Priolo is not due to the number of positive skin test responses to individual antigens, but rather to the size of individual reactions.\r"

In order to probe the mechanism(s) underlying these reactions, an animal model has been developed. The guinea pig model reproduces both the respiratory and immunologic effects of isocyanates that have been observed clinically. In experimental animals and in humans, isocyanates induce immunologic reactions with specific antibody formation, including IgE. This finding allows development of diagnostic reagents to assess isocyanate sensitivity. Further characterization of immunologic components in the model is expected to increase understanding of the mechanisms of this immunotoxic disease and develop strategies for treatment and prevention.\r"

In the litigious social climate in which we live, the increased number of disability and personal injury claims and the ambiguous posturing by the legal profession often dictate a new set of diagnostic rules and norms. These must be considered by allergists and other practitioners in evaluating patients with polysomatic complaints allegedly due to trace environmental contaminants and with little or no identifiable pathology by gross or microscopic examination of tissues or laboratory data. These patients may have been declared totally disabled and may be seeking or receiving large amounts of personal injury compensation. Furthermore, they may be under \"treatment\" with multiple unproven diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and properly controlled challenge procedures may be necessary to prove or disprove the necessity for these diagnostic tests and therapies. With the ever increasing industrialization of our environment, it is likely that patients with these problems, who present for evaluation, will increase in number. It is therefore prudent for the practitioner to consider sound, comprehensive approaches to diagnoses and management of these conditions and above all to allay morbid fears of clinically relevant disease or immune system dysfunction based on results of isolated laboratory test findings.\r"

  ".W": "The Lung Health Study is a randomized clinical trial designed to determine whether a smoking intervention program and prescription of an inhaled bronchodilator can reduce the annual rate of decline of FEV1 (FEV1 slope) in cigarette smokers with mild to moderate airflow limitation. During the recruitment period, spirometry measurements were obtained during three screening visits from 5,887 cigarette smokers 35 to 60 yr of age. To improve the statistical power of the study to detect significant differences in the FEV1 slopes among study groups, the spirometry testing protocol carefully controls for multiple factors that are known to increase intraindividual variability of FEV1 and FVC results. These factors include participant preparation, maneuver acceptability and reproducibility, technician training and performance monitoring, equipment design and calibration, and result processing. The objective of this report is to describe the success of the spirometry quality control program in minimizing the short-term intraindividual FEV1 variability. The mean difference between the FEV1 values obtained at the second and third screening visits (mean 25 days apart) was +5.7 ml in women and -14.7 ml in men, with a mean intraindividual variability of 119 ml in women and 162 ml in men, with a coefficient of variation of 5.8% for both. During only 2.1% of the test sessions were participants unable to produce three acceptable FVC maneuvers with the two best FEV1 values matching within 5% or 100 ml. Institution of site visits and technician performance monitoring was associated with improved test session quality grades and maintenance of high quality grades thereafter.\r"

Pulmonary function tests included FVC, FEV1, maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR), the slope of phase III of the single-breath nitrogen test (delta N2/L), and closing volume as a percent of vital capacity (CV/VC). The data show that after fixing the effects of age, height, and weight by analysis of covariance, the adjusted means of delta N2/L in nonsmokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers were 0.92, 1.10, and 1.60% in women and 0.97, 1.05, and 1.23% in men, respectively. The difference in the adjusted means for delta N2/L between smokers and nonsmokers was larger in women than in men, 0.67% versus 0.26%, respectively. Multiple multivariate analyses show that the regression slopes for the residuals of FEV1, MMFR, and delta N2/L versus pack-years were significantly different between men and women. The regressions of FEV1 and MMFR decreased and the regression of delta N2/L increased with increasing pack-years more rapidly in women than in men. The combined effect of sex and pack-years on pulmonary function was not significant for ex-smokers. These data suggest that cigarette smoking may be more detrimental in its effects on lung function in women than in men.\r"

In addition to spirometry, a standardized questionnaire was administered by trained personnel. A study population of 944 remained after exclusion of workers for incomplete demographic data and/or spirometry with poor within-session reproducibility, i.e., greater than or equal to 10% variability in the two largest values of either FVC and/or FEV1. Overall mean values of changes across the work shift in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were -0.8% (-0.04 L) and +2.1% (+0.13 L/s), respectively. Standard deviations for these across-shift changes were 5.8% (0.19 L) and 13.2% (1.19 L/s) for FEV1 and PEFR, respectively. In univariate analyses, mean values of across-shift changes were not statistically related to age, race, sex, smoking status, work shift, or FEV1/FVC ratio. However, variability (i.e., standard deviation) of across-shift changes were significantly related to some of these factors. These observations provide a basis for interpreting results of occupational respiratory morbidity surveys involving measurement of changes in FEV1 and/or PEFR across a work shift.\r"

  ".W": "Interstitial lung disorders associated with the connective tissue diseases are thought to be quite common, but their precise analysis is fraught with difficulty because of the absence of a Gold Standard that, short of open lung biopsy, is not available. Analysis is hampered by the biologic variability in test results, large overlap between the normal and the disease population for individual tests, the confounding effect of smoking, and the complexities of viewing multidimensional data. In order to better define the pattern of the lung involvement, an entirely different approach has been adopted that is based on the use of graphic and clustering techniques to define the multivariate structure inherent in the data, then discriminant analysis to assign patients into distinct clusters. Using this approach it has been possible to group patients into four distinct clusters based on the result of respiratory function studies, gallium lung scan, bronchoalveolar lavage, and smoking status. These clusters are a normal smoking cluster and a normal nonsmoking cluster, a cluster of patients with active ILD, and a cluster with bronchiolitis. The validity of this method has been verified, and an algorithm has been developed that allows the assignment of any new patient entering the study into one of these clusters. This type of analysis offers a valuable new approach to the categorization of patients into distinct groups based on the results of multiple investigations.\r"

Of particular interest was the contrast between centriacinar and panacinar emphysema as they relate to silica exposure and the presence of silicosis. Subjects with significant emphysema, that is, with an emphysema score of 30% or more, were classified as having predominantly panacinar or predominantly centriacinar emphysema, and compared to those without emphysema (emphysema score less than or equal to 10%). Of those who had significant emphysema (greater than or equal to 30%), 24% had predominantly panacinar, 43% predominantly centriacinar, and 33% were classified as mixed. The odds ratios (OR) for the association between each emphysema type and dust exposure (one unit of the cumulative dust index) were found to be statistically significant and of equal magnitude [1.019, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.005 to 1.033 for panacinar and 1.019 with a 95% CI of 1.007 to 1.031 for centriacinar emphysema]. In 163 nonsmokers insignificant panacinar emphysema was more common than centriacinar emphysema. The results indicate that a miner with 20 yr in high-dust occupations has a 3.5 (1.7;6.6) times higher odds of having a significant degree of emphysema at autopsy than a miner not in a dusty occupation. This is likely to be true of smoking miners only because there were only four nonsmokers with an emphysema score between 30 and 40%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 39 patients exhibited a continued weight loss in the previous year. REE measured with a ventilated hood system was significantly (p less than 0.005) higher in weight-losing compared to weight-stable patients when values were normalized for predicted metabolic rate (117 +/- 3 and 108 +/- 2%, respectively) or kg fat-free mass using bioelectrical impedance (FFM-BI): 35.0 +/- 0.8 and 31.8 +/- 0.6 kcal/kg, respectively). Normalized values of E-Intake were not significantly different between weight-losing and weight-stable patients. REE/FFM-BI correlated significantly with FEV1 (r = 0.22, p less than 0.05), maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Plmax; r = 0.35, p less than 0.001), and E-Intake/FFM-BI (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001). Classification in three subgroups by severity of disease, (1) FEV1 greater than 35%, (2) FEV1 less than or equal to 35%, and (3) PaO2 less than 7.3 kPa, revealed a higher prevalence of weight loss in the more compromised groups and a significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) E-Intake in the hypoxemic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the diabetic subjects, mean values for total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, VC, and FEV1 were similar to predicted values. Diffusing capacity, K, and in K did not differ significantly from corresponding values in healthy subjects. The regression of in K on age was significant (R = 0.52; p less than 0.01) and similar to that obtained for 124 healthy subjects. The findings show that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus does not affect pulmonary function. This study does not support the routine testing of lung function in otherwise well diabetic nonsmokers.\r"

  ".W": "In spontaneous asthma after a deep inhalation (DI) obstruction occurs in direct proportion to disease severity. Since this has been associated with peripheral inflammation, which is present in cystic fibrosis (CF), we tested whether worsening obstruction after DI also occurs in CF in 12 patients. We assessed volume history effects by comparing isovolumic expiratory flows (Vmax) during forced exhalation begun at the end of tidal inspiration (partial P) with those begun at TLC (maximal M) to obtain M/P. As in asthma there was a correlation between M/P and FEV1 (% predicted; r = 0.64, p less than or equal to 0.03, n = 12). To control for a time dependency effect due to preferential emptying of fast compartments early in both the P and M maneuvers, we compared Vmax obtained from a first partial (P1) with a second (P2) obtained after inspiration to TLC and slow exhalation to the same starting volume as P1 (P2/P1). In contrast to asthma the P2/P1 was greater than the M/P and not related to disease severity. A further index of nonhomogeneous lung emptying was the relationship between M/P and the slope ratio at 70% TLC (r = -0.67, p less than or equal to 0.03). After isoetharine inhalation the M/P decreased (-0.12 +/- 0.12, p less than or equal to 0.01) but no change was apparent in P2/P1, indicating further increases in the degree of nonhomogeneity. We conclude that although volume history effects on M/P are similar in asthma and CF, this is due to a predominance of parenchymal hysteresis in the former and nonhomogeneity in the latter, which worsens with bronchodilator use.\r"

Nine subjects aged 56 to 75 yr were studied from 4 to 19 h after cardiac operations. When subjects were ready to be weaned from mechanical ventilation their ventilation-perfusion distribution was estimated using the multiple inert gas elimination technique during SIMV. The subjects then received PSV and APRV during alternating periods on a randomized basis, and the gas-exchange measurements were repeated. Vasoactive infusions and inspired oxygen fraction were held constant throughout the investigation. The results indicated that the major characteristics of the main mode of the VA/Q distributions (mean, standard deviation, and skew) were similar during all three modes. Dead space was lower during APRV (30.1 +/- 1.7% [SEM]) than during SIMV (36.2 +/- 1.5%) and PSV (37.1 +/- 2.7%) (p less than 0.05). Right-to-left shunt was significantly greater during APRV (19.9 +/- 2.3%) than during SIMV (15.4 +/- 1.7%) (p less than 0.05). Peak airway pressure (Paw) was higher during SIMV (32.8 +/- 1.3 cm H2O) than both PSV (19.4 +/- 2.1 cm H2O) and APRV (14.3 +/- 1.0 cm H2O) (p less than 0.05). Minute ventilation was lower during APRV (7.5 +/- 0.07 L/min) than during SIMV (9.4 +/- 0.6 L/min) and PSV (9.0 +/- 0.5 L/min) (p less than 0.05). Hemodynamic variables were similar during all three modes. We conclude that all three modes provide acceptable oxygenation and ventilatory support.\r"

  ".W": "We asked whether oxygen consumption is dependent on oxygen delivery in 17 patients who had severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 10 of whom had increased concentrations of plasma lactate. We determined oxygen consumption using analysis of respiratory gases while increasing oxygen delivery using blood transfusion. Oxygen consumption did not change after transfusion (from 227 +/- 83 to 225 +/- 82 ml/min, p less than or equal to 0.38). Oxygen delivery increased from 1,043 +/- 468 ml/min (24%, p less than or equal to 0.001). Even in the 10 patients who had increased concentration of plasma lactate and metabolic acidosis, oxygen consumption remained constant after increasing oxygen delivery (pretransfusion, 224 +/- 101 ml/min; post-transfusion, 225 +/- 99 ml/min; p less than or equal to 0.83). These data have more than 99% power of detecting a change in oxygen consumption of 20 ml/min after transfusion. Therefore, we conclude that directly measured oxygen consumption remains constant and independent of increases in oxygen delivery in our patients with severe ARDS. Because simultaneously determined oxygen consumption calculated from variables shared with the calculation of oxygen delivery yielded a dependent relationship, we speculate that finding dependence of calculated oxygen consumption on oxygen delivery may be the result of methodologic error.\r"

The dogs breathed through a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted through a chronic tracheostomy, and resistive loads of 8 to 49 cm H2O/L/s were added to the expiratory circuit. Arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) was measured with an ear oximeter, and isocapnic progressive hypoxia was induced by a rebreathing technique. Arousal from sleep was determined by electroencephalographic and behavioral criteria. SaO2 at arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep increased progressively from 67.5 +/- 4.6% (mean +/- SEM), with no added resistance to 85.2 +/- 0.5% with the highest resistance (p less than 0.01), and from 60.6 +/- 0.6 to 81.6 +/- 0.4% during REM sleep (p less than 0.01). The added resistances also increased the steady-state (normoxic) level of alveolar PCO2 (PACO2). However, when PACO2 was increased to comparable levels by the addition of dead space rather than expiratory resistance to the breathing circuit, SaO2 at arousal from hypoxia was significantly lower than during expiratory resistive loading (p less than 0.05). We therefore conclude that mechanoreceptor stimuli arising from the ventilatory apparatus may contribute substantially to the arousal response to hypoxia.\r"

The volunteers included 22 sons of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean value for the slope factor of the end-tidal PO2-ventilation hyperbola (A) significantly decreased from 98.3 +/- 12.2 to 77.4 +/- 10.3 L/min mm Hg (p less than 0.05), but that for the end-tidal PCO2 ventilation line (S) did not change over the years. The individual values for the hypoxic ventilatory response were significantly correlated (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001) between the initial and final examinations but not so for the hypercapnic ventilatory response (r = 0.23, NS), suggesting that the latter is more subject to influence from extrinsic factors than the former in the long term. The reproducibility of both tests expressed as coefficients of variation was similar or rather small for the hypercapnic ventilatory response, which was determined by three consecutive measurements at 1 wk intervals in a different group of six subjects. From these data we conclude that hypoxic chemosensitivity is more determined by factors inherent to the individual than hypercapnic chemosensitivity and that it is more systematically influenced by temporal factors, as demonstrated by the systematic decrease over the years.\r"

This investigation was designed to examine whether endogenous opiate activity modulates the compensatory ventilatory response to apnea in OSAS. Polysomnography and quantitative measurement of tidal volume was performed in 12 patients with moderate to severe OSAS during a morning nap study before and after intravenous administration of 10 mg of naloxone. Apnea index was not significantly altered. There was a small but significant shortening of apneas (postnaloxone apnea duration, 91.2% of prenaloxone; p = 0.002 by ANOVA). Tidal volume of the first postapnea breath and minute ventilation extrapolated from the first two postapnea breaths, but not frequency, increased significantly after naloxone (postnaloxone first breath volume, 112.7% of prenaloxone value [p = 0.03], with a similar increase for minute ventilation, 115.1% [p = 0.007]). The volume of the first postapnea breath was correlated with the duration of the previous apnea, both before (r = 0.59, p = 0.0001) and after naloxone. Despite this, analysis of covariance with apnea duration as the covariate confirmed a significant independent increase in postapnea breath volume after naloxone (p = 0.001). Naloxone also altered sleep architecture, increasing percent time awake during the study period (prenaloxone, 36.3 +/- 15.6%; postnaloxone, 56.7 +/- 22.4%; p = 0.0003) and decreasing total sleep time and percent time in Stage 1. Furthermore, naloxone increased continuity of awake periods (mean length of awake periods increased from 27.0 +/- 8.4 to 66.0 +/- 66.6 s after naloxone, p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heavy snorers without apnea both show intrathoracic suction pressures during sleep that exceed their static upper airway closing pressures. Complete airway occlusion, however, occurs only in the former patient group. We hypothesized that the kinetic properties of the airflow would be different in these two types of patients because of differences in upper airway morphology. The pharyngeal computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional areas of the upper airways in 15 patients with OSA, 25 nonapneic heavy snorers, and 14 control subjects while they were awake. Nocturnal breathing was monitored with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB). The patients with OSA had a narrower airspace at the velopharyngeal (VP) level than the controls (p less than 0.01); the nonapneic snorers did not differ from the other groups. At the tongue base (TB) and the hyoid bone (HB) levels there was no difference between the OSA and the control groups, but the nonapneic snorers had narrower airways at both of these levels compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01) and at the hyoid bone level compared with the OSA group (p less than 0.05). The VP/HB ratio was the parameter that best distinguished the patients with OSA from the nonapneic snorers (lower in the OSA group, p less than 0.001). We suggest that airway collapse during sleep is favored by a narrow velopharynx associated with large hypopharynx. Some heavy snorers may not have an oropharyngeal collapse because the peak inspiratory suction pressure could already be damped down at the level of the relatively narrow hypopharyngeal airways.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in pharyngeal function, manifested even when the patients are awake, are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Tests of awake pharyngeal function continue to stimulate interest because it is hoped that they may allow physicians to distinguish patients with sleep apnea from those without it, and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary sleep studies. We elected to study two measures of pharyngeal function: changes in pharyngeal area with lung volume (PLVD) and changes in pharyngeal area in response to externally applied positive pressure, i.e., pharyngeal distensibility (Cph). Both measurements have been employed for assessment of pharyngeal function, and both are thought to reflect pharyngeal \"floppiness.\" Measurement of PLVD is technically very simple, whereas the measurement of Cph is technically more complex. If the two measurements are highly correlated, it might be possible to replace the technically more difficult one by the simpler one. Consequently, the purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to examine the relationship between pharyngeal distensibility and lung volume dependence of pharyngeal area, and second, to compare these parameters in a large group of confirmed snorers with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We studied 75 unselected patients referred for the investigation of snoring and suspected sleep apnea. All patients had nocturnal polysomnography, pulmonary function tests, and measurement of pharyngeal areas at TLC, FRC, and residual volume (RV) employing the acoustic reflection technique. The area measurement at FRC was performed at zero and at 4.1 cm H2O positive airway pressure to calculate pharyngeal distensibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During sleep, mild reduction in inspiratory airflow is associated with snoring, whereas obstructive hypopneas and apneas are associated with more marked reductions in airflow. We determined whether the degree of inspiratory airflow reduction was associated with differences in the collapsibility of the upper airway during sleep. Upper airway collapsibility was defined by the critical pressure (Pcrit) derived from the relationship between maximal inspiratory airflow and nasal pressure. In 10 asymptomatic snorers, six patients with obstructive hypopneas, and 10 patients with obstructive apneas, during nonrapid eye movement sleep, Pcrit ranged from -6.5 +/- 2.7 cm H2O to -1.6 +/- 1.4 and 2.5 +/- 1.5 cm H2O, respectively (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001). Moreover, higher levels of Pcrit were associated with lower levels of maximal inspiratory airflow during tidal breathing during sleep (p less than 0.005). We conclude that differences in upper airway collapsibility distinguish among groups of normal subjects who snore and patients with periodic hypopneas and apneas. Moreover, the findings suggest that small differences in collapsibility (Pcrit) along a continuum are associated with reduced airflow and altered changes in pattern of breathing.\r"

We assessed the frequency of ETS-related symptoms by administering a questionnaire to 77 healthy nonsmoking young adults who were participating in an unrelated study. Of the subjects 34% (26 of 77) reported one or more rhinitis symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, or sneezing) following ETS exposure. We then exposed 10 historically ETS-sensitive (ETS-S) and 11 historically ETS-nonsensitive (ETS-NS) subjects to 15 min of clean air followed by 15 min of sidestream tobacco smoke (CO concentration of 45 parts per million). At selected time points during these procedures we recorded symptoms, posterior nasal resistance, and spirometry and performed nasal lavages. ETS-S but not ETS-NS subjects reported significant (p less than 0.01) increases in nasal congestion, headache, chest discomfort or tightness, and cough following exposure to sidestream tobacco smoke. Rhinorrhea symptoms were greater and more prolonged in ETS-S subjects compared to ETS-NS subjects. Significant (p less than 0.01) increases in perception of odor and in eye, nose, and throat irritation occurred in both study groups, but ETS-S subjects reported significantly more nose and throat irritation. No significant changes in posterior nasal resistance occurred in the ETS-NS group but a significant increase occurred in the ETS-S subjects, with the resistance rising from 3.8 +/- 0.5 cm H2O/L/s (mean +/- SE) preexposure to a peak of 8.0 +/- 2.7 cm H2O/L/s 20 min after completion of the smoke exposure (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Breath-by-breath inspiratory UAR was calculated at isoflow during exclusive nasal breathing. The UAR response to hypoxia was characterized by the changes in nasal resistance and pharyngeal resistance (PR) as a function of SaO2, mean inspiratory flow (VT/Tl), and changes in the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) measured with an inductance vest. The ventilatory response to hypoxia was greater during T (-0.31 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2; mean +/- SEM) than during P (-0.27 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2, p = 0.05). UAR decreased as SaO2 decreased; this decrease was steeper during T than during P hypoxia (delta PR/%SaO2: 3.9 +/- 0.5 during P and 2.5 +/- 0.2 during T, p = 0.05). For the whole group, there was no difference in the slope of the decrease in UAR with increasing VT/Tl between the two hypoxic tests (delta PR/delta VT/Tl: -0.85 +/- 0.1 during P and -0.70 +/- 0.1 during T, p greater than 0.05). However, in four subjects, the slope of the relationship PR/VT/Tl during T remained steeper than during P.

To evaluate this hypothesis we compared the effects of nebulized furosemide with those of bumetanide, another high ceiling diuretic that inhibits Na+/Cl- transport, on bronchial challenge with adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and MBS in 16 asthmatic subjects. We also studied the effects of furosemide on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in seven of these subjects.

Airborne measurements were made with a cascade impactor and a two-site monoclonal antibody-based immunometric assay for cat allergen Fel d I. Within 30 min of entering a 30-m3 clean room the cat itself was found to increase airborne Fel d I by 30 to 90 ng/m3. Following serial weekly washing of the cat this increase was reduced to less than or equal to 7 ng/m3, with a more marked fall in small particles (less than or equal to 2.5 microns diameter) from 9.5 to less than or equal to 0.4 ng/m3. To study the influence of the room design we kept the cat in a room of 33 m3 for 20 h/day and modified the room. This room was studied with or without furnishings and with air-exchange rates of 0.2 or 2.4 air changes per hour. Both low ventilation rate and furnishings increased the level of Fel d I measured 1 h after the cat was removed.

We have investigated the effects of the two loop diuretics, furosemide (10(-6) to 10(-3) M) and bumetanide (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), on airway smooth muscle contraction in vitro induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS), or exogenously applied acetylcholine (ACh) or substance P (SP) in guinea pig tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle strips pretreated with indomethacin (10(-5) M) and propranolol (10(-6) M). Both furosemide and bumetanide caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of cholinergically mediated neural contraction in the trachea. The effect of furosemide was not influenced by the presence of airway epithelium. Furthermore, both furosemide and bumetanide inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) contraction induced by electrical field stimulation of bronchi pretreated with atropine (10(-5) M). Neither drug at the highest concentration inhibited the responses to exogenous acetylcholine (10(-8) to 10(-2) M) or substance P (10(-9) to 10(-5) M). Thus loop diuretics inhibit the neurally induced contraction of guinea pig airways without a direct effect on airway smooth muscle. We conclude that loop diuretics inhibit both cholinergic and excitatory NANC neurotransmission in guinea pig airways and that this effect may be related to their inhibitory effects on the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter.\r"

Microvascular leakage in trachea, main bronchi, and proximal and distal intrapulmonary airways was determined by measurement of extravasated Evans blue dye content. For comparison, the responses to inhaled histamine (3 mM) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) (3 mM), which act directly on airway smooth muscle, were also examined. Inhaled PAF increased RL dose-dependently, with a maximal response (peak RL) at 4 min after the inhalation, whereas the response to histamine or 5HT was maximal within a few seconds after the inhalation. Peak RL (cm H2O/ml/s) was significantly less after PAF (1.03 +/- 0.09) than after histamine (8.39 +/- 1.07) or 5HT (18.3 +/- 6.48), although there was no significant difference in RL after hyperinflation (recovery RL). No additional increase in RL was seen between 5 and 10 min after exposure. PAF caused a dose-dependent increase in Evans blue dye extravasation; 3 mM PAF induced significantly higher leakage than did histamine or 5HT at all airway levels at 6 min. PAF did not cause any additional extravasation of Evans blue dye at 10 min compared with that at 6 min after exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first aliquot [proximal airway (PA) sample] was analyzed separately from the pooled Aliquots 2 through 4 [distal airway and alveolar surface (DAAS) sample]. The data from the PA and DAAS samples were then combined to calculate the values that would have been obtained by pooling all BAL washes. FEV1 was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased 1 h after O3 exposure, but it returned to preexposure values at 6 and 24 h after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the PA sample was significantly elevated at less than 1 h (3.7%) at 6 h (16.5%), and at 24 h (9.2%) after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the DAAS sample and calculated pooled values were significantly elevated at 6 h (4.1 and 7.6%) and at 24 h (5.1 and 5.8%) after O3. These data demonstrate that O3-induced symptoms, FEV1 decrements, and airway neutrophilia follow different time courses and indicate that the pooling of BAL washes may obscure the detection of an O3-induced bronchiolitis. The degree of neutrophilia in the BAL did not correlate with the sensitivity of the individual subjects when measured by acute changes in FEV1, suggesting a dichotomy of pathways that result in O3-induced airway neutrophilia and pulmonary function decrements.\r"

Neutrophil sequestration within the lungs of seven normal subjects, 10 min after reinjection, correlated with local erythrocyte transit times in the lungs (tau = 0.72, p less than 0.001). This relationship was lost in patients with COPD. In seven patients studied during an acute exacerbation of COPD, neutrophil retention was higher during the first passage through the lungs (mean, 22.0 SD 14.1%) compared with 14 patients studied when their condition was stable (16.3 SD 3.4%, p less than 0.001), or to the normal elderly subjects (13.7 SD 7.0%, p less than 0.001). In addition, the subsequent rate of neutrophil washout from the lungs was slower in patients with acute COPD (1.93 SD 0.66 x 10(-3)s1) than in those with stable disease (3.08 SD 1.8 x 10(-3)s-1, p less than 0.02). Neutrophil retention in the lungs correlated inversely with the extent of emphysema, assessed quantitatively by CT scanning (tau = 0.68, p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Vitronectin, also known as S-protein, is a 75,000-dalton serum glycoprotein that has a variety of functions, including the capacity to interact with the terminal components of the complement cascade, the coagulation system, and cell surfaces. By virtue of its ability to interact with cells, vitronectin is capable of mediating cell-spreading and adhesion and may also influence cell differentiation and cell growth. To investigate the possibility that vitronectin might contribute to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease, vitronectin was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and, for comparison, normal volunteers. Vitronectin was detected in lavage fluid and serum of all study subjects. Increased lavage fluid concentrations were found in patients with interstitial lung disease when compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.005), and glucocorticoid-treated patients with interstitial lung disease had lower vitronectin levels than did untreated patients. Furthermore, on SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis lavage fluid vitronectin comigrated with serum vitronectin, suggesting similar molecular size. Thus, vitronectin is a normal constituent of the epithelial lining fluid, and lavage fluid vitronectin is similar to serum vitronectin. The increase of vitronectin concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid of patients with interstitial lung disease suggests that vitronectin may contribute to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease.\r"

In order to characterize the cell types that are targets for this immunoregulatory hormone, we have evaluated the expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and those recovered from the lung by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases (tuberculosis and sarcoidosis) and from normal control subjects using combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques. Lavage T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis or with sarcoidosis, but not those from normal control subjects, expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors as demonstrated by binding of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3, which was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled 1,25(OH)2D3, but not by the presence of unlabeled 25(OH)D3 (receptor-positive lymphocytes: sarcoidosis, 20 +/- 12%; tuberculosis, 31 +/- 17%). In contrast, blood lymphocytes from patients with granulomatous diseases did not express detectable 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. The percentage of lavage T-lymphocytes expressing 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors was significantly greater for patients with tuberculosis presenting with isolated hilar adenopathy than for patients with pulmonary infiltrates and/or cavities. 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors were expressed to a greater extent on CD8+ T-lymphocytes than on CD4+ T-lymphocytes in sarcoidosis, whereas a greater proportion of CD4+ than of CD8+ T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis were receptor-positive. These findings support the conclusion that the interaction of 1,25(OH)2D3 with its receptor on T-lymphocytes may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions, but because these receptors are expressed on different lymphocyte populations, the net effect of this potent immunoregulatory molecule is likely different in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.\r"

Sixty-two percent of patients were female, the majority of whom had no discernible preexisting pulmonary disorder to account for their susceptibility. A short- and long-term favorable response to therapy was observed in more than 90% of the 16 patients treated with intent to cure. Suggested as plausible explanations for the favorable response rate compared with previous studies originating in referral settings were: absence of adverse selection as shown by a smaller proportion of patients with far-advanced cavitary disease or with previous treatment failure, and a larger proportion of female patients. A previously unreported pattern of MAC-PD was observed: disease limited to the lingula or middle lobe occurred in 21% of the patients, all female. A rarely identified pattern, primary disease in a 3-yr-old exposed to pet birds, is reported.\r"

Noninfectious episodes of pulmonary disease following BMT are more frequently encountered in patients with hematologic disorders or malignancy and are probably related to ablation therapy or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, patients with SCID do not receive chemotherapy before an HLA-identical allogeneic BMT and they do not suffer significant GVHD. We report a patient who developed severe lung disease during the period of rapid engraftment following an HLA-identical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Lung biopsy showed dense lymphocytic infiltrates in the alveolar septae and no evidence of infection. Following the idea that the acute recruitment of engrafted lymphocytes may have contributed to or caused the pulmonary disease, we have attempted to suppress cellular immunity by administering high-dose methylprednisolone. The patient's lung disease rapidly improved and eventually completely resolved.\r"

Substance P alone caused human bronchial smooth muscle contraction at 10(-6) M or more. Phosphoramidon (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) potentiated the substance P-induced contraction in a dose-dependent fashion, and phosphoramidon shifted the dose-response curve to lower concentrations. Capsaicin (10(-5) or 10(-4) M) alone caused bronchial smooth muscle contraction in four tissues from nine patients. After the contraction by capsaicin reached a plateau, phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) increased and prolonged the contraction significantly. Furthermore, pretreatment of bronchial tissues with phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) potentiated capsaicin-induced contraction in all tissues from five patients. Phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) shifted the dose-response curve to capsaicin to lower concentrations more than 1 log unit. Captopril did not alter the contractile response to substance P, suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme does not regulate the contractile response to substance P in human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro. These results suggest that enkephalinase regulates the contractile effects of exogenous substance P and endogenous substances, probably tachykinins, released by capsaicin in the human bronchus.\r"

  ".W": "Autonomic nerves can influence airway caliber via their effects on airway smooth muscle, bronchial vessels, and mucous glands and may therefore contribute to airway narrowing in asthma or in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Human lungs receive cholinergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic efferents and several types of afferents. Cholinergic nerve activity contributes to airway narrowing both in asthma and in COPD. Reflex vagal activity may be enhanced because of epithelial damage and exposition of sensory nerve endings to nonspecific irritants. Other possible mechanisms include defects in prejunctional receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release, several postjunctional factors that nonspecifically enhance the effect of a given degree of cholinergic muscle contraction on airway caliber, and interactions between inflammatory mediators and the cholinergic system. The main direct bronchodilating nerve activity in human lungs is nonadrenergic, and scanty data suggest that nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve activity may be variably reduced in asthmatics. Human airway muscle virtually lacks adrenergic innervation, but adrenergic nerves may influence airway caliber by acting on bronchial vessels, mucous glands, and parasympathetic nerves and ganglia. The response of asthmatic airways to beta-agonists seems intrinsically normal, but it may be reduced during severe asthma attacks. There are no convincing data that abnormal adrenergic control is present in the airways of patients with COPD. The physiologic relevance of excitatory neuropeptides in sensory nerves in human airways is uncertain. Tachykinins have proinflammatory and spasmogenic properties and are therefore of potential interest as a factor in the pathogenesis of obstructive airway disease. In conclusion, the data presently available support an abnormal autonomic control of the airways in asthma but not in COPD.\r"

This evokes both protective reflexes such as cough as well as local release of tachykinins and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) with subsequent actions on blood vessels (vasodilatation and plasma protein extravasation) and bronchial smooth muscle (bronchoconstriction). After capsaicin pretreatment when peptides have been depleted from the sensory nerves, there is a marked reduction of the vasodilatatory response upon allergen challenge and the protein extravasation evoked by cigarette smoke. Conversely, chronic cigarette smoke exposure is accompanied by increased coughing to capsaicin challenge. Furthermore, aerosol immunization and chronic smoke exposure are both associated with elevated tissue levels of CGRP, suggesting upregulation of C-fiber function and peptide synthesis, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity.\r"

These responses can be broadly explained in terms of present knowledge of the pathologic features and the mechanisms causing the abnormalities in the two diseases, and they highlight the important differences between the diseases. It seems likely that tests of BHR with histamine and methacholine cannot be used to distinguish asthma from COPD in subjects with a mild decrease in FEV1 and symptoms that do not clearly suggest asthma or COPD. However, a dose-response curve to methacholine is helpful. If there is a plateau, and the PD20 FEV1 is more than 4.0 mumol, it is unlikely to be asthma. If there is no plateau, a test with propranolol or SO2 may be useful to discriminate the two diseases. The similarities in the responses-especially those to histamine-explain why there is frequently difficulty in deciding the nature of the disease present in an individual subject. Is it important to distinguish the two diseases? In the introduction it was suggested that it is important for understanding these diseases, for prognosis, for treatment, and ultimately for prevention. It remains difficult to determine prognosis from any single test of bronchial responsiveness, and response to prophylaxis (stopping smoking, allergen avoidance) plus drug treatment over several years is probably needed to predict outcome in an individual patient. Finally, despite the valid hypothesis proposed by Orie and coworkers (2), it seems unlikely that studying the characteristics of BHR will shed light on the \"host\" factors present in both diseases that remain poorly understood.\r"

Differences in the static deflation pressure-volume curve between COPD and asthma can easily be shown, but it has been surprisingly difficult to find distinctive mechanical features of impaired airway function caused by air-space destruction. This may be because in mild airway obstruction related to smoking--particularly in younger subjects--emphysema may be absent, and the predominant site of airway narrowing in the smallest bronchi and respiratory bronchioles may be the same as that found in asthma in remission. In more severe obstruction caused by COPD there is almost always very severe intrinsic disease of the airways and this may so dominate the functional abnormality that it is difficult to detect any additional change because of airspace destruction. Overall, few studies have set out to detect specific effects of parenchymal destruction on airway function.\r"

For example, although in a random sample of 339 subjects investigated in the Netherlands, subjects with a history of asthmatic attacks, wheeze and/or dyspnea, or chronic dry cough on average were the most responsive (mean PD20 values for histamine of 11.5, 17.0, and 15.0 mg/ml) and asymptomatic subjects were the least responsive (mean PD20, 45.4 mg/ml), the distributions of PD20 values in all groups overlapped considerably. The best way to investigate the association between exposure and disease is in a cohort study. It is argued that follow-up studies in patients may have limited meaning because of a high risk for selection bias. Furthermore, in general, diagnostic disease entities will not represent homogeneous exposure groups. It is concluded that end points of disease should be defined as objectively as possible, for instance, as the level of FEV1, or as simple respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, wheeze, or chronic cough. Terms such as \"asthma,\" \"COPD,\" or \"CNSLD\" will not be helpful in defining end points because there is a risk that they could introduce bias, misclassification, and hence confusion.\r"

  ".W": "A better outcome of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appears to be determined by higher FEV1, smoking cessation, lower airway hyperresponsiveness, and, at least in the presence of therapy, with a higher reversibility of airflow obstruction. In our opinion, these findings provide a firm ground for smoking cessation and most likely for institution of early treatment directed at both the reversible part of airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with COPD. But there are large gaps in our understanding of the effects of bronchodilator and antiinflammatory drugs on airway hyperresponsiveness. After acute administration, sympathomimetics cause a larger reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness than do anticholinergics, both in asthma and in COPD. What happens after longer periods of treatment is not yet clear in COPD, whereas in asthma there may occur a deterioration of airway responsiveness. Corticosteroids appear to have a beneficial effect on lung function and the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma. In COPD, however, no definite conclusion can be drawn as to the beneficial effect of corticosteroids, but short-term effects are not promising. The available data from the literature strongly suggest the need for long-term studies with large groups of patients in order to assess a potential treatment effect. In this way, also, a subgroup of patients with COPD who improve with corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators may be found. It seems advisable to include both subjective (i.e., quality of life, complaints, symptoms) and objective (i.e., hospitalization, survival, FEV1, PEFR, PC20, and reversibility) data as investigational tools for outcome analysis.\r"

Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk.\r"

ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury was studied in 15 patients to determine whether traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in posttraumatic ECF. Thirty-three per cent of patients with posttraumatic ECF spontaneously healed fistulas with appropriate nutritional support without operative intervention. Sixty-six per cent of patients required operative intervention, either because of associated sepsis or failure to spontaneously heal. Five patients had fistulas originate from areas of bowel not injured in the initial injury. This study suggests traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury and result in a spontaneous closure of fistulas in one-third of patients. In addition, sepsis is the main indication for early aggressive operative treatment of these fistulas.\r"

While anatomic hemisection of the cord, resulting in ipsilateral motor and proprioception loss and contralateral pain and temperature deficit, is a fully understandable concept, in the context of the acute trauma evaluation, these findings may be confusing because they are unexpected. Penetrating trauma is far more likely to cause this uncommon syndrome than vehicular crash, fall, or crushing injury. Pediatric victims frequently have no fracture. Early neurosurgical consultation, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if plain film radiography is uninformative, and consideration for rapid decompression if the deficit and pathologic anatomy warrant, are the recommended approaches. Motor function recovery from blunt injury may be expected within six months, a better prognosis than for penetrating injury causing the syndrome.\r"

Therefore, a vast majority of trauma patients undergo cervical spine X rays when only a relatively small number of them will actually have a cervical spine injury. Because of the costly overuse of radiography, studies have been undertaken to define high yield criteria for evaluation of patients. This study examined the characteristics of acute cervical spine fracture/dislocation in alert trauma patients. Of 79 patients with this discharge diagnosis at St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center between 1982 and 1987, 47 met the criteria of Class I level of consciousness. All 47 patients complained of neck pain or demonstrated cervical tenderness to palpation. Other parameters (such as loss of consciousness, paresthesias, decreased sensation, weakness, cervical muscle spasm, decreased anal tone, and associated injuries) did not, individually or in combination with each other, consistently predict cervical spine injury. Although occult or painless cervical spine injuries have been reported in the literature, a careful review of these cases revealed that these injuries were not truly asymptomatic. Our study suggests that selected patients can be excluded from radiologic evaluation of the cervical spine. However, large prospective studies are needed to validate this finding.\r"

Patients who required a central venous line for the first time while in their SICU were studied. Those with preexisting catheter infections, bacteremias, and TLC reinsertions were excluded. TLC was placed through the internal jugular or the subclavian vein and all peripheral lines were removed. The distal port was used for parenteral nutrition and the other two ports were used for fluids and medications. Dressings were changed daily and blood cultures were obtained through each port of the TLC. At the time of catheter removal, blood, catheter tip, and the subcutaneous tract were cultured. Duration of catheterization was recorded. Eighty-six catheters were studied. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.2 days and the range was two to 23 days. Six of 86 (6.9%) catheter tip cultures were positive and the remaining 80 (93.1%) were negative. Two positive tips (2.3%) had negative blood cultures for two catheter infections (CIs). The remaining four catheters (4.6%) had associated bacteremias for four catheter sepsis (CS). The two catheter infections occurred among catheters indwelling for 10 days or less while the four cases of catheter sepsis occurred among catheters indwelling longer than 10 days. In conclusion, triple lumen catheters can be safely left in place for up to 10 days with minimal risk for bacteremia.\r"

To identify the presence of cardiac abnormality following BTT, 123 hemodynamically stable patients were prospectively evaluated with serial electrocardiograms (ECG) and cardiac enzymes (total CPK and CPK-MB). Gated cardiac radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scans were performed within 48 hours following admission. Patients included in the study sustained significant thoracic trauma identified by physical findings or mechanism of injury. Sixty-three patients (51%) were identified with either abnormal ECG, or abnormal total CPK, CPK-MB, MUGA scan, or combination of the above. Thirty-seven patients (58.7%) manifested an ECG abnormality defined as ST-segment or T-wave abnormality. Twenty-two patients (34.9%) had total CPK value greater than or equal to 50 International Units (I.U.) or CPK-MB fractions greater than or equal to five per cent. MUGA scan was abnormal (right ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 per cent and/or wall motion abnormality) in 12 patients (19%). Eight patients with MUGA scan abnormality had normal ECG and/or normal total CPK, CPK-MB values. Evaluation of all patients up to six months revealed no mortality, malignant arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sterile propellant gas was passed through tubing to the spray head and independently controlled, allowing for drying of the tissue surface immediately before FG application. This technique was found to be effective in achieving hemostasis of parenchymal organs, retroperitoneal surfaces, and skin graft donor sites. Additional potential applications of this technique include the control of hemorrhage from mediastinal and pleural surfaces.\r"

However, the prevalence of hepatitis (HPT) in trauma patients is poorly described. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of HPT in trauma patients admitted to an urban trauma center. Two hundred sixty-four consecutive admissions to an urban Level I trauma center underwent serologic screening for HPT. Risk factors were assessed by direct patient questioning. Serologic evidence of HPT B was found in 19.7 per cent of patients. Intravenous (IV) drug abusers represented eight per cent of the study population; this group had a 67 per cent rate of seropositivity. Hepatitis A was not found in any patient. Antigenemia was found in 1.9 per cent of patients. It is concluded that HPT B seropositivity is common in trauma patients. IV drug abusers have particularly high prevalence of HPT. This high prevalence rate of HPT B serology poses a significant risk to those involved with the care of trauma patients. The authors suggest that specific protocols to avoid the transmission of viral disease should be mandatory in urban trauma centers.\r"

In order to delineate the predisposing and prognostic factors in these patients, the authors reviewed 47 cases of clostridial bacteremia presenting over a seven year period at a major metropolitan teaching hospital. Predisposing factors included locally decreased oxidation reduction potential (Eh) in 43 per cent (including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and radiation therapy), systemic immunosuppression in 53 per cent (including alcohol abuse, chemotherapy, steroids, and malignancy), and a site of epithelial barrier disruption. The sites of clostridial invasion included: gastrointestinal tract (GI) (n = 22), pulmonary (n = 7), cutaneous (n = 7), undetermined (n = 7), and female genital tract (n = 4). Seven patients were found to have malignancy. Seventy-nine per cent of the blood culture isolates were histotoxic species (Clostridia perfringens and C. septicum). The overall mortality was 47 per cent. Significant differences between survivors and deaths included DIC, new onset renal failure, severe atherosclerotic disease, and age (P less than .05). The authors conclude that clostridial bacteremia is uncommon but highly lethal and may occur when decreased tissue Eh, systemic immunosuppression, and an epithelial barrier disruption are present. Poor outcome appears to be a reflection of advanced age, underlying illness, and presence of a histotoxic species.\r"

Steering wheel deformity correlated with pelvic fractures (P less than 0.001) and closed head injuries (P less than 0.005).

The authors conclude that a careful examination of the accident scene for specific mechanisms of injury can lead to better prehospital care, more rapid and consistent diagnosis of injury, and improved patient outcome. Further prospective studies should accumulate data that will improve prehospital care, alert physicians to possible injury, increase community awareness of injury prevention, and improve vehicle construction.\r"

SETTING: Hospitals owned by a health maintenance organization in Washington. PATIENTS: Elderly patients (n = 462) hospitalized because of a hip fracture between 1977 and 1983 and an equal number of age- and sex-matched population-based control patients. MEASUREMENTS: Use of thiazide diuretics and furosemide was ascertained from medical records and computerized pharmacy records. The relative risk for hip fracture associated with diuretic use was calculated and adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of nursing home residence; previous hospitalizations; a history of stroke, alcoholism, or the organic brain syndrome; body weight; leg paralysis; and use of phenobarbital, corticosteroids, or other diuretics. Current and former users of diuretics were analyzed separately. MAIN RESULTS: The adjusted risk for hip fracture was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5) for current thiazide users. The adjusted risk for hip fracture for current furosemide use was 3.9 (CI, 1.5 to 10.4). CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, use of thiazide diuretics did not protect against hip fracture and cannot be recommended for fracture prevention. Current furosemide use was also associated with hip fracture.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of intensive postremission chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of patients. SETTING: Chemotherapy recipients were treated in 44 hospitals in West Germany in two cooperative group trials; transplants were done in 98 hospitals worldwide. PATIENTS: Patients (484) receiving intensive postremission chemotherapy and 251 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for ALL in first remission. Patients ranged from 15 to 45 years of age and were treated between 1980 and 1987. MAIN RESULTS: Similar prognostic factors predicted treatment failure (non-T-cell phenotype, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, and 8 or more weeks to achieve first remission) of both therapies. After statistical adjustments were made for differences in disease characteristics and time-to-treatment, survival was similar in the chemotherapy and transplant cohorts: Five-year leukemia-free survival probability was 38% (95% CI, 33% to 43%) with chemotherapy and 44% (CI, 37% to 52%) with transplant. No specific prognostic group had a significantly better outcome with one treatment compared with the other (6% for the difference; CI, -3% to 15%). Causes of treatment failure differed: With chemotherapy, 268 (96%) failures were from relapse and 11 (4%) were treatment-related; with transplants, 43 (32%) failures were from relapse and 92 (68%) were treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bone marrow transplants currently offer no special advantage over chemotherapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission.\r"

DESIGN: Open-label study. SETTING: Three university medical centers. PATIENTS: Five patients with AIDS who were infected with thymidine-kinase-deficient or -altered strains of varicella-zoster virus. INTERVENTION: Foscarnet, 40 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours in 1-hour infusions for 10 or more days. MAIN RESULTS: Four patients had healing in response to foscarnet therapy, and each of four tested patients became culture negative for virus during foscarnet therapy. Results of fluorescent antigen testing remained positive during therapy in two patients; one of these patients had concomitant clinical failure but the other patient healed fully. One patient had complete healing despite the emergence of resistance to foscarnet in serial specimens obtained during foscarnet therapy. CONCLUSION: Foscarnet is a potentially effective and tolerable antiviral agent for patients with acyclovir-resistant, varicella-zoster virus infection; however, the optimal dosage and duration of therapy require further study, as does the relation between clinical findings and in-vitro susceptibility results.\r"

DESIGN: Renal artery images were obtained in patients with renal artery stenosis having percutaneous balloon angioplasty and in normal subjects by digital angiography and by a 20-MHz, mechanically driven, catheter-based, intravascular ultrasound imaging system. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Four randomly selected normal subjects without known renal disease and four consecutive patients with known renal artery stenosis referred for percutaneous balloon angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS: Digital angiograms and intravascular ultrasound images of nine renal artery segments were obtained. In patients with renal artery stenosis, imaging was done before and after balloon angioplasty. MAIN RESULTS: Digital angiography and ultrasonography correlated closely in the determination of arterial lumen diameter (r = 0.81) and cross-sectional area (r = 0.83). However, ultrasonography provided structural information not shown by angiography. All normal arteries showed discrete intimal, medial, and adventitial wall layers by ultrasonography. In the five stenotic segments, angiography identified the cause of stenosis to be atherosclerosis in four patients and fibromuscular dysplasia in one patient. Ultrasound imaging, however, identified the disease process as atherosclerosis in three patients and as fibromuscular dysplasia in two patients. After renal angioplasty, ultrasonography identified three arterial dissections, only one of which was shown by angiography. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data indicate that catheter-based intravascular ultrasound imaging of the renal artery is feasible and correlates well with angiography in assessing renal artery size and also provides potentially important additional structural information that permits a better characterization of arterial pathology.\r"

With the cooperation of the SSA, 52 new disability claimants who alleged rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus were identified at the beginning of their claim. At the same time that their claim was being formally reviewed, they had a standardized examination by an independent rheumatologist who was not involved with their care, and they had a standardized test of observed performance. Rheumatologists' judgments of ability to work were compared with the SSA judgments. Rheumatologist and SSA judgments were in agreement for 35 of the 52 claimants (67%). All 11 claimants who met or equaled the SSA medical evaluation criteria were judged work-disabled by the rheumatologist. Of 27 judged able to work by the SSA, the rheumatologist judged 11 to be unable. Agreement between the SSA judgment of residual functional capacity and observed performance was no more than would be expected by chance. Most SSA judgments agree with a clinician's evaluation but a standardized physical evaluation by a rheumatologist and performance-based tests appear to add important information.\r"

DATA SOURCES: Pertinent articles were obtained through an English-language MEDLINE search from 1979 to 1990 and from the references of these articles. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the studies in which patients with poorly controlled diabetes received insulin and a sulfonylurea agent and in which insulin treatment alone (usually given in conjunction with a placebo) was compared with insulin plus sulfonylurea therapy. DATA EXTRACTION: Pre- and post-treatment insulin doses, blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin values, C-peptide levels, and insulin levels were analyzed. Other data were analyzed separately. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from similar trials were compared. Data from concurrent trials were analyzed separately from data derived from cross-over trials. Weighted mean fasting blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin dosage, and fasting C-peptide concentrations were determined for insulin plus placebo and insulin plus sulfonylurea agent groups for both types of studies. In concurrent trials, the weighted mean post-treatment glycated hemoglobin level was 11.1% after insulin plus placebo compared with 10.0% after insulin plus a sulfonylurea agent. In cross-over trials, the corresponding values were 10.6% and 9.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with insulin and a sulfonylurea agent only slightly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. When a sulfonylurea agent was used, less exogenous insulin was needed, but fasting serum insulin levels were not different between the treatment groups. Such therapy did not produce nearly normal blood glucose concentrations and therefore should not be used in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes receiving insulin.\r"

Three major obstacles impede the provision of universal access. First is the deeply embedded sense among our citizens and in our health care system that some persons are more deserving than others of care. Second is a focus on costs and reimbursement mechanisms rather than on defining effective and appropriate care. Third and most serious is an absence of leadership in addressing the problems of access and of reform in the U.S. health care system. In choosing among the possible leaders, which include the federal government, the states, the business sector, unions, and physicians, a compelling argument can be made that physicians should lead, particularly in defining effective and appropriate care. Physicians may also lead in redesigning the health care system, but they are likely to be only one interested voice in the debates about financing health care.\r"

Mark Twain's story, \"The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut,\" is used to illustrate how traditional strategies for motivating patients to change can have the paradoxic effect of inhibiting change and growth. We use a theory of human motivation, referred to as self-determination theory, to explain this effect and suggest alternative strategies for facilitating patient motivation. Empirical tests of the theory have shown that people will accept more responsibility for behavior change when motivated internally rather than externally. In the doctor-patient relationship, this internal motivation for change can be facilitated when doctors allow choice, provide relevant information, and acknowledge the patient's perspective. We propose a simple, three-question model, consistent with self-determination theory, for physicians to use with patients who smoke and are not yet ready to try quitting.\r"

SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.\r"

In each of them, one of 13 different drugs was incriminated and no other cause was found. In one case due to bleomycin, a neutrophil and eosinophil alveolitis was present. In the other 18, the common denominator was a lymphocyte alveolitis, either pure (n = 6) or associated with neutrophilia (n = 5), eosinophilia (n = 3), or neutrophilia and eosinophilia (n = 4). In addition, in all patients, an inverted CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio was observed. In eight patients who underwent another BAL, lymphocyte alveolitis decreased but was persistent in two of them two to four months after cessation of treatment with the drug incriminated, whereas interstitial pneumonitis had resolved clinically. In five patients, after resolution of pneumonitis and after an almost normal BAL cell profile was obtained, resumption of treatment with the suspected drug for two to four weeks induced a rise in lymphocyte population in a third BAL. In conclusion, apart from one case of bleomycin lung, the most striking feature of drug-associated alveolitis in this series was expansion of lymphocyte population and imbalance in lymphocyte subsets. When a provocation test was performed, variations in alveolar lymphocyte levels paralleled withdrawal and readministration of the drug responsible for alveolitis. These data could be of value in diagnosing and understanding drug-induced lung disorders.\r"

Relative absorption of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was equivalent (54.0 +/- 9.0 mg.L-1.g DHA-1 from tuna, 56 +/- 9.0 mg.L-1.g DHA-1 from fish oil, NS). Platelet aggregation in response to the endoperoxide analog U46619 was significantly diminished after either preparation but aggregation in response to other agonists, bleeding time, and membrane n-3 (omega-3) fatty acid content were not changed. Thus, n-3 fatty acids are well absorbed after one dose of either tuna or fish oil but EPA absorption appears to be more efficient from tuna. Additionally, a single dose of n-3 fatty acids decreases platelet aggregation by a mechanism not requiring incorporation into platelet membranes.\r"

To investigate the retinoid reaction in man, we have treated non-sun-exposed skin with 0.1% retinoic acid cream (Retin-A, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, Raritan, NJ) under occlusion for 4 d to induce erythema and then examined changes in 1) histology, 2) expression of cell-surface molecules, 3) the enzymes and second messengers of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signal-transduction system, 4) levels of eicosanoids, and 5) levels of interleukin-1 protein and mRNA. These parameters were chosen for measurement both because they are indicators of epidermal function and previous studies suggest they may be responsive to retinoic acid treatment. Epidermal cell growth as judged by increased epidermal thickness and mitotic figures was significantly increased in retinoic acid-treated skin compared to vehicle-treated controls. Increased numbers of CD4+ T cells accompanied by prominence of dermal dendrocytes in the papillary dermis and focal keratinocyte expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were observed in retinoic acid-treated biopsies. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity and 1,2-diacylglycerol content were also elevated in retinoic acid-treated epidermis. Protein kinase C activity was reduced by one third in both the soluble and membrane fraction, suggesting down-regulation. Surprisingly, in view of the inflammatory nature of the retinoid reaction, no increases were observed in arachidonic acid, its metabolites, interleukin-1 alpha, or interleukin-1 beta. To examine the specificity of the retinoid reaction, subjects were treated with the irritant sodium lauryl sulfate, under conditions that resulted in a reaction clinically similar to that observed with retinoic acid. The histologic alterations induced by sodium lauryl sulfate were found to be indistinguishable from those induced by retinoic acid. These data indicate that, although a wide range of cellular and molecular alterations occur in retinoic acid-treated skin, these changes may not be necessarily specific or unique for retinoic acid.\r"

Incidence rates for side effects are reported as events/1000 patient-years. Our descriptive study revealed an individual profile of prevalent toxicities for each drug. Oral gold was characterized by substantial lower gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (diarrhea 391 events/1000 patient-years, loose bowel movement 148, lower abdominal pain 76), MTX by hepatotoxicity (47) while D-penicillamine had the only clinically significant incidence of altered taste (40). MTX users reported the most mucosal ulcers (87), followed by oral gold (76), im gold (55) and D-penicillamine (38). Rash was frequently seen with gold compounds and D-penicillamine, while upper GI toxicity was common with immunosuppressive agents. Cyclophosphamide had 48% discontinuations within 6 months. MTX had the lowest discontinuation rate in the first 6 months, but then showed little difference from im gold. A preliminary similarity index was developed to compare the toxicity profiles of various DMARD. Close similarities were found between toxicity profiles of im gold and D-penicillamine, and between azathioprine and MTX. Oral gold had a unique toxicity pattern. Knowledge of these different toxicity patterns can enable more appropriate selection of agents for particular patients.\r"

  ".W": "Type II Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is one of a group of disorders characterized by striking abnormalities of the soft connective tissues. The major fibrillar collagens (types I and III) found in these tissues have important stress-bearing functions and abnormal collagen could therefore account for the clinical features of this condition. We have used a number of restriction site dimorphisms, tightly linked to the structural genes of type I collagen (COL1A1 COL1A2) and type III collagen (COL3A1), to investigate the segregation of corresponding alleles in three pedigrees in which type II EDS was clearly inherited as a dominant trait. Discordant segregation of all three collagen genes was seen in a large pedigree that included 17 affected individuals with the typical phenotype of type II EDS. Thus mutations in neither type I nor type III collagen genes were responsible for the disease in this family. In a second small pedigree discordant segregation of the disease with both type I collagen loci was observed while the concordant segregation seen at COL3A1 could easily have arisen by chance (P = 0.5). The third pedigree was uninformative at all three collagen loci because of inability to discriminate between the parental alleles. These results suggest that there may be molecular heterogeneity of type II EDS since abnormalities of type I collagen have been described in other individuals phenotypically similar to those in our study.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit an HLA class II epitope found on most DR4 and DR1 molecules. We have investigated the possibility of other associations being present in the minority of patients lacking these antigens. One hundred and eighty patients with classical or definite RA and 100 controls were assigned HLA-DR, DQ and DP types by a DNA-based system using sequence-specific oligonucleotides to probe amplified class II alleles amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The expected associations with DR4 (relative risk 10, P less than 0.0001) and DR1 (relative risk 2.3, P less than 0.001) were observed and only 13% of individuals lacked both of these alleles compared with 54% of age- and race-matched controls. A significant association with DRw10 (P = 0.02) was also observed in the DR4/DR1-negative RA group (3/23 patients compared with 0/54 DR4/DR1-negative controls). No novel associations with other DR, DQ, or DP alleles were evident in contrast to some previous studies. The third allelic hypervariable region of the DR beta chain of DRw10 contains a similar amino acid sequence to that found in many DR4 and DR1 molecules. These results extend this correlation and suggest that this susceptibility determinant may account for the HLA-linked susceptibility in 89% of our cases of RA.\r"

For all the patients the following investigations were carried out: (1) HLA antigens determination for nine antigens at A locus and 15 at B locus and 6 at DR locus; (2) rheumatoid factor. We found: (1) RA disease is genetically controlled and the responsible genes are linked to the HLA system; (2) association between seropositivity and DR4 and DR4/B27 genotypes; (3) significant effect of the genotype DR4/B27 on the age of onset; (4) association between the increase in disease severity both clinical and radiological and DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. Thus the genetic control is probably composed of two types of genes: disease susceptibility genes and disease severity genes linked to DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes.\r"

SF samples were assayed for laboratory parameters of inflammation such as leucocyte content, the percentage polymorphonuclear cells, the pH, and for immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM). SF IL-6 concentrations were determined using the B9-bioassay. Within individual patients the local activity of inflammation as measured using clinical parameters was found to be related to the local SF IL-6 level. When considering the total group of patients, a correlation (P less than 0.001) was found between the clinical parameters of local inflammation and the SF IL-6 levels. Furthermore, IL-6 levels were found to correlate with leucocyte counts (P less than 0.02), the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (P less than 0.10), the pH value (P less than 0.01), but not with SF IgM and IgG concentrations.\r"

After 2 years the prevalence of ulnar deviation, buttonhole deformity, and swan neck deformity was 13%, 16%, and 8%, respectively. Altogether, 31 patients had developed one or more deformities. There was no difference in age or gender distribution and no predominance of the dominant hand. Each patient with a deformity was matched according to age, sex, and disease duration with another early RA patient without deformity. The deformity group had more active disease, less grip strength, more disability, and markedly more severe radiographic changes. When studied retrospectively at a time point 3 months prior to the detection of deformity, synovitis of relevant joints was as common in the group who developed deformities as in the control group. This suggests that joint inflammation may contribute to the genesis of deformity but additional factors are needed. Hand deformities were found to be common in early RA.\r"

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of each condition in groups of patients with PFM and IBS compared to normal and disease control populations. We studied four patient groups, 20 patients in each group, with PFM, IBS, inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and also 20 normal controls. Using strict diagnostic criteria, each group was assessed by two investigators for symptoms and signs of PFM and IBS. Sigmoidoscopy was performed when indicated. Results indicate that 70% (14/20) of the PFM patients had IBS and 65% (13/20) of the IBS patients had PFM. This compared with the control groups where 12% (7/60) and 10% (6/60) had PFM and IBS respectively. In conclusion, these results indicate that PFM and IBS frequently coexist. A common pathogenetic mechanism for both conditions is therefore suggested.\r"

Its treatment is associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several years. This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are available. Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities. There is still no established \"best\" or \"only\" first treatment of metastatic breast cancer. When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex. It is only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will develop. Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the patient. Communication must remain open. In the final stages of the illness, treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and anxiety.\r"

DESIGN: Mail survey in 1989 and follow-up telephone interviews in 1991 to update and verify the information. SUBJECTS: The undergraduate deans of the 16 Canadian medical schools. INTERVENTION: The mail survey asked five questions: (a) Is completion of a standard first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course a requirement for admission to medical school? (b) Are these courses and those in basic and advanced cardiac, trauma and neurologic life support for children and adults provided to undergraduate students? (c) During which undergraduate year are these courses offered? (d) Is their successful completion required for graduation? and (e) Who funds the training courses? RESULTS: The medical schools placed emphasis on the seven courses differently. More than half the schools required the completion of courses before admission or taught some courses but did not require the completion of the courses for graduation. On average, fewer than three of the seven courses were taught, and the completion of fewer than two was required for graduation. About half of the courses were funded by the universities. The annual projected maximum cost of teaching the seven courses was $1790 per medical student. CONCLUSION: The seven resuscitation courses have not been fully implemented at the undergraduate level in Canadian medical schools.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical features of 4 unpublished cases and 26 published cases of acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis induced by hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). DATA SOURCES: The unpublished cases were found in the database of the Drug Adverse Reaction Program, Health Protection Branch, Department of National Health and Welfare, and the database of the Programme conjoint de pharmacovigilance, in Quebec. The published cases were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: Reported cases were selected if they were sufficiently documented. All published cases were selected because a differential diagnosis had been made in each one. DATA SYNTHESIS: The onset was acute and dramatic; the average time to onset of symptoms was 44 minutes. Sex was a predominant risk factor, since 27 (90%) of the 30 patients were women. The average age was 56 years; thus, most of the women were postmenopausal. Over two-thirds of the patients had one to three positive prechallenges or rechallenges, 3 of the 52 documented adverse events occurred after a voluntary rechallenge, some were life-threatening and necessitated mechanical ventilation, and 1 was fatal. Treatment was supportive; avoidance of HCT was the only prevention. CONCLUSION: Acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis due to HCT is extremely rare and potentially fatal. Such a reaction can be diagnosed only if the clinician suspects it when presented with a case of unexplained acute pulmonary edema.\r"

  ".W": "Melanoma metastases were harvested from 82 patients for the purpose of growing and expanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Tumor tissue cell suspensions were incubated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), followed by repeated exposure to tumor antigen with or without OKT3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Initial growth success was achieved in 56 of 82 cultures (72%). Efforts were made to expand 26 of these 56 cultures for therapeutic TIL; 23 of 26 early cultures (88%) were successfully expanded for in vivo therapy. It took a mean of 78.5 +/- 25.4 days to grow sufficient TIL for treatment. Therapy included cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) on day 1, followed by a 96-hour continuous infusion of IL-2 (18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d) on days 2 to 5, and approximately 10(11) (mean 1.49 +/- 0.93 x 10(11)) TIL on day 2. Patients who responded received monthly IL-2 as a 96-hour infusion. Median patient age was 45 years of age. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were men. Performance status was 0 to 1 in 77% of patients. Thirty-four percent of the patients had liver metastases. The usual IL-2 toxicities were seen. Response rate for 21 patients was 24% (95% confidence interval, 10% to 49%). One complete response was achieved with cells 98% CD4+; four partial responses were achieved with cells 80%, 94%, 98%, and 98% CD8+, respectively. Four of eight patients who received TIL, which had never been stimulated with OKT3, had tumor response. The authors conclude that a treatment plan for IL-2/TIL is technically difficult, costly, and effective for only a minority of patients. Overall, clinical results are not clearly superior to those obtained with other IL-2 regimens.\r"

Malignant cells were identified in the stained preparations in all nine patients with cancer (100% sensitivity), and there were few false positives (94.5% specificity). The authors concluded that if additional studies with greater numbers of subjects confirm the reliability of this technique, a test may be developed that would be useful for either early detection or screening.\r"

Cancerous tissues had significantly elevated SLX concentrations compared with noncancerous tissues of various organs. Tissue SLX concentration of the cancerous part was significantly higher than that of the adjacent noncancerous part in the same tissue. There was no significant correlation between tissue SLX concentration and serum SLX level. Positive localization of SLX was clearly observed in such cancerous tissues by immunohistochemical study, although not in any noncancerous tissues. Each of the antigens: SLX, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 125 showed a different distribution pattern in tissue concentration or localization in various organs. These results indicate that SLX may be a valuable cancer-associated antigen produced by malignant tissues, suggesting its clinical application as a tumor marker.\r"

The 5-year survival rate was 52%; this was better than that of other types of high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Histologic examination showed distinctive morphologic features such as tumor cell pleomorphism, sinus infiltration, fibrosis, partial lymph node involvement, sparing of B-cell regions, and occasional plasma cell infiltrates. Eighty percent of the cases were of T-cell phenotype, and others expressed neither B-cell nor T-cell markers. The tumors were frequently positive for a histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR), CD25 (the interleukin-2 receptor), and epithelial membrane antigen. Rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta gene were observed in nine of 13 cases (69%). These findings indicated that many of the tumors had the phenotype and genotype of activated T-cells. This study also showed that large cell anaplastic lymphoma has a survival figure intermediate between Hodgkin's disease and low-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.\r"

The FNA were insufficient in 15 instances (9%) and in error in 39 (24%). In 15 cases, the incorrect aspiration diagnosis could have led to excessive surgery and in ten cases to delayed therapy if it had been the only guide for therapy. The diagnosis was deferred to permanent section analysis in 30 (19%) frozen sections. Twenty-two errors (14% of cases) were made in the interpretation of frozen section material, and in an additional 15 patients (9%), the diagnosis suggested (but deferred at frozen section) was in error. In one patient, this error could have led to more extensive surgery than necessary; in 21 patients, the frozen section error could have led to undertreatment. When frozen section results were combined with those of FNA, no therapeutically important false-positive diagnoses were made. In five patients, the combination of both FNA and frozen section results would not have identified a carcinoma which, in three cases, was a small occult papillary carcinoma not found in the index nodule.\r"

  ".W": "All ascertainable cases of malignant mesothelioma in Australia were notified to a national surveillance program in the period January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1985. There were 854 cases obtained and 823 confirmed on clinical (77) or histologic (746) ground. Tumor site was known in 759 cases (685 pleural and 74 peritoneal). Lung fiber content analyses by light microscopy and analytic transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis were done on 226 cases in which postmortem material was available, using the method of Rogers. Cell type was determined by a five-member expert panel of pathologists appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. There was a statistically significant trend between lung fiber content (fibers/g dry lung) and cell type from epithelial (low fiber content) through mixed to sarcomatous (high fiber content). This trend was most apparent for total uncoated fibers (chi-square = 6.8, df = 1, P less than 0.01) and crocidolite (chi-square = 6.7, df = 1, P less than 0.01). Lung fiber content also was associated with tumor site; higher lung fiber content being associated with peritoneal tumors. This relationship was significant for all fiber content measures except chrysotile and was independent of the fiber content-cell type relationship (log-linear analysis). Survival from time of provisional diagnosis was significantly longer for epithelial (mean, 13 months; standard deviation [SD], 12.8) and mixed (mean, 10.2 months; SD, 8.7) types than sarcomatous cell types (mean, 5.8 months; SD, 6.5; P less than 0.0001, by analysis of variance on log10 survival time). Survival time was significantly greater for pleural tumors (mean, 11.4 months; SD, 13.4) than peritoneal tumors (mean, 8.6 months; SD, 12.5) (P less than 0.005, by Student's t test on log10 survival time).\r"

The survival rate of patients with high EGFR level (more than 50 fmol/mg protein) was significantly lower than that of patients with low EGFR level (less than 50 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01), although a correlation between EGFR level and the pathologic findings was not observed. The expression of EGF was examined immunohistochemically using anti-EGF monoclonal antibody in 100 esophageal cancer tissues; EGF-positive tumor cells were detected in 92.0%. The immunoreactivity of EGF was classified arbitrarily into four grades according to the number of stained tumor cells. The expression of EGF significantly correlated with the differentiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P less than 0.01, by chi-square test). The survival rate of patients with high EGF immunoreactivity (Grade 2 or 3) was much lower than in those with lower grade (0 or 1) tumors, (P less than 0.01). Patients with both high EGFR level and EGF immunoreactivity had a much worse prognosis than if both were low. Furthermore, the mitotic index was higher in groups with both high EGFR and EGF than if both were low (16.39 +/- 5.35 versus 6.90 +/- 3.31). These results suggest that EGF and EGFR in the autocrine system may play an important role in tumor progression in esophageal cancer and their expression could be of prognostic significance.\r"

In T1 pancreatic cancer, 13 of 23 cases (56.5%) of SPan-1 and 14 of 23 cases of (60.7%) of CA 19-9 had levels above normal. Although the numbers of patients were small, sensitivities of CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I were 30.8%, 22.2%, and 28.6%, respectively. In T2 pancreatic cancer, 41 of 51 cases (80.4%) of SPan-1 and 40 of 51 cases (78.4%) of CA 19-9 showed higher levels than normal, but only 46.9% of CEA, 40.0% of DUPAN-2, and 52.6% of elastase I were positive. The overall sensitivities in small pancreatic cancer (less than 4.0 cm) were 73% for SPan-1 and CA 19-9 but were less for CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I. These results indicate that even small pancreatic cancers release detectable pancreatic cancer-associated antigens in serum in more than 70% of cases, especially SPan-1 and CA 19-9. The measurement of these two tumor markers makes it possible to detect small pancreatic cancers after using imaging diagnostic procedures.\r"
