  ".W": "The results of twenty-three distal femoral varus osteotomies (in twenty-one patients) that were performed between 1977 and 1984 were evaluated. Fifteen osteotomies were done for osteoarthritis; three, for post-traumatic arthritis or deformity; three, for rheumatoid arthritis; and two, for renal osteodystrophy. The median age of the patients was fifty-six years (range, nineteen to seventy years). The length of follow-up averaged four years (range, two to nine years). The average tibiofemoral angle preoperatively was 18 degrees of valgus, which was corrected postoperatively to an average of 2 degrees of valgus. At follow-up, nineteen (83 per cent) of the twenty-three knees were rated as good or excellent according to The Hospital for Special Surgery knee score, which had improved from an average of 65 points preoperatively to 86 points post-operatively. Of the fifteen patients who had osteoarthritis (93 per cent), all but one had a good or excellent result. Most patients had no substantial improvement in the range of motion of the knee as a result of the operation. Eighty-six per cent of the patients expressed satisfaction with the outcome. We concluded that varus osteotomy of the distal part of the femur is a reliable and effective surgical procedure for the treatment of gonarthrosis associated with valgus deformity due to osteoarthritis or trauma. We do not recommend its use in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis or in those who have inadequate motion of the knee before the operation.\r"

A pulmonary embolus did not develop in any patient, but about 40 per cent had thrombosis in the veins of the calf, whether passive motion had been administered or not. Radiographically, the deep-vein thrombosis was seen to extend into or proximal to the popliteal vessel in 5 per cent of the patients in each group. Sex, age, obesity, or a history of hypertension or diabetes did not influence the incidence of venous thrombosis, but there was a higher incidence in patients in whom cement was used for fixation of the total knee components, irrespective of the use of continuous passive motion of the limb.\r"

A surgical technique that was designed to produce a horizontal joint line and a tibiofemoral angle of zero degrees is described. At an average length of follow-up of four years, twenty-two of twenty-four patients had a successful result as judged by our protocol for evaluation. One osteotomy had to be revised for failure of fixation, and one patient had a pulmonary embolism that had a satisfactory outcome after the administration of anticoagulants. One patient required manipulation of the knee at six months. The simple surgical technique that we used was effective in realigning the femoral with the tibial axis in patients who had a valgus deformity of the knee, a superolateral tilt of the joint line, and osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment.\r"

Postoperatively, fifty patients (32.3 per cent) had an effusion on the ipsilateral side. In seven of them, the effusion had been present before the operation. All of the effusions subsided completely within three weeks after the operation. Results of the laboratory analysis of a specimen of the effused material from eight patients who were chosen at random showed non-inflammatory fluid. Probably the effusions were traumatic in origin, and it is likely that they were a response to stresses that had been incurred during the operation or at the time of fracture.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of seventeen children whose ages ranged from two to eighteen years and who were treated for a disorder of a sacro-iliac joint between 1975 and 1983 were reviewed retrospectively. Thirteen children were acutely ill, with a temperature of more than 38 degrees Celsius, and four had chronic symptoms that had persisted for three weeks to one year. Pain in the hip, thigh, and buttock was the most common symptom. Of the thirteen acutely ill patients, eleven had septic arthritis of a sacro-iliac joint, while one who had ankylosing spondylitis and one who had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis had acutely painful arthritis of a sacro-iliac joint. Of the four patients who had chronic symptoms, two had septic arthritis of a sacro-iliac joint; one, ankylosing spondylitis with sacro-iliac involvement; and one, eosinophilic granuloma of the ilium. Thus, thirteen patients had septic arthritis of a sacro-iliac joint and four had some other disorder. For the seventeen children who had acute or chronic symptoms, at admission the white blood-cell count ranged from 3,500 to 26,200 per cubic millimeter (average, 11,100 per cubic millimeter) and the sedimentation rate, as determined by the Westergren technique, ranged from twenty-two to sixty-five millimeters per hour (average, fifty millimeters per hour). Twelve of the plain radiographs of the seventeen patients were negative. The initial bone scans of all seventeen patients were positive in eleven and negative in six. Of these six, five had septic arthritis and one, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A computed tomographic scan was performed in four patients and was positive in all of them: three had septic arthritis and one had ankylosing spondylitis. Organisms were cultured successfully from blood, from material aspirated from the sacro-iliac joint, or from stool of all thirteen patients who had sepsis. The thirteen infections responded well to appropriate antibiotics, which were administered intravenously to seven patients and first intravenously and then orally to six.\r"

The mean curve measured 65 degrees preoperatively and 30 degrees postoperatively. The mean loss of correction was 3 degrees after a mean length of follow-up of forty months. As of the time of writing, pseudarthrosis had not developed in any patient. No patient had a broken rod or an increased neurological deficit. There were no major pulmonary complications. The most common early postoperative complication was wound infection, which occurred in five patients, none of whom required removal of the hardware. We concluded that posterior spinal fusion with Luque-rod segmental instrumentation is an effective method of obtaining and maintaining correction of a spinal curve, with minimum complications, in patients who have cerebral palsy and progressive scoliosis.\r"

  ".W": "A telemeterized total hip prosthesis was implanted in one patient and force-data were obtained. Thirty-one days postoperatively, the magnitude of the joint-contact force during double-limb stance was 1.0 times body weight. During ipsilateral single-limb stance the joint-contact force was 2.1 times body weight, and during the stance phase of gait the peak force typically was 2.6 to 2.8 times body weight, with the resultant force located on the anterosuperior portion of the ball. During stair-climbing, the force was 2.6 times body weight. At peak loads, the angle between the resultant force and the axis of the neck was 30 to 35 degrees and that between the resultant force and the plane of the prosthesis was 20 degrees. During stair-climbing or straight-leg raising, the out-of-plane orientation of the resultant force increased substantially. These data provide information concerning the forces that must be sustained by prosthetic hip joints during a number of common activities of daily living within the first month after implantation. The results also provide insight into the progression of early recovery and demonstrate the variety of forces that are generated during this period.\r"

  ".W": "After the implantation of methylmethacrylate cement into the posterior part of the cervical spine of the dog, a thick layer of connective tissue forms at the bone-cement interface. The tissue is six to eight millimeters thick and in all animals it surrounds the dorsal and lateral aspects of the masses of implanted cement, grows between the undersurface of the cement and the bone of the posterior elements, and completely covers that bone. This tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy and its collagenous components were extracted and analyzed biochemically by gel electrophoresis. Specific extracellular matrix proteins in the tissue at the bone-cement interface were also localized by immunohistochemistry. The tissue at the host-cement interface contained zones of fibrocytes and plump and teardrop-shaped cells within a collagenous matrix. Type-I, Type-III, and Type-V collagen were extracted and were identified by gel electrophoresis. Type-V collagen and fibronectin were localized predominantly around the plump and teardrop-shaped cells. Type-IV collagen and laminin were localized predominantly in an area just beneath the teardrop-shaped cells at the surface of the tissue overlying the cement, suggesting that a basement-membrane-like tissue had formed in this area.\r"

  ".W": "At the Mayo Clinic, between 1978 and 1982, forty-four total knee arthroplasties were performed with cement in twenty-six adults who had rheumatoid arthritis. The age at operation ranged from nineteen to thirty-nine years old. The twenty-six patients were followed for two to eight years (average, five years). At the time of final follow-up, thirty-nine knees were free of pain and five were mildly painful during weight-bearing. The Hospital for Special Surgery knee score improved from a mean of 52 points preoperatively to 84 points postoperatively. There were twenty-four excellent, fourteen good, six fair, and no poor results. Radiographic analysis revealed an incomplete radiolucent line that was more than one millimeter in width adjacent to five tibial and four femoral components in eight knees (18 per cent). The positions of the components had not changed. Postoperatively, there was one transient peroneal palsy and two knees required patellar resurfacing. No revisions were performed for loosening of a prosthesis. We concluded that use of a cemented total knee prosthesis in a patient who has rheumatoid arthritis and is less than forty years old provides a satisfactory result and that the component will not loosen after an average of five years.\r"

  ".W": "We applied specific forces and moments to the knees of fifteen whole lower limbs of cadavera and measured, with a six degrees-of-freedom electrogoniometer, the position of the tibia at which the ligaments and the geometry of the joint limited motion. The limits were determined for anterior and posterior tibial translation, internal and external rotation, and varus and valgus angulation from zero to 90 degrees of flexion. The limits were measured in the intact knee and then the changes that occurred with removal of the posterior cruciate ligament, the lateral collateral ligament, the popliteus tendon at its femoral attachment, and the arcuate complex were measured. The cutting order was varied, allowing us to determine the changes in the limits that occurred when each structure was cut alone and the amount of motion of the joint that was required for each structure to become taut and to limit additional motion when the other supporting structures had been removed. Removal of only the posterior cruciate ligament increased the limit for posterior tibial translation, with no change in the limits for tibial rotation or varus and valgus angulation. The additional posterior translation was least at full extension and increased progressively, reaching 11.4 millimeters at 90 degrees of flexion. The progressive increase in posterior translation with flexion was apparently due to slackening of the posterior portion of the capsule, as the translation nearly doubled when the posterolateral structures subsequently were removed. Removal of only the posterolateral extra-articular restraints increased the amount of external rotation and varus angulation. The average increase in external rotation depended on the angle of flexion; it was greatest at 30 degrees of flexion and decreased with additional flexion. At 90 degrees of flexion, the intact posterior cruciate ligament limited the increase in external rotation to only 5.3 degrees, less than one-half of the 13.0-degree increase that occurred at 30 degrees of flexion. Subsequent removal of the posterior cruciate ligament markedly increased external rotation at 90 degrees of flexion, resulting in a total increase of 20.9 degrees. The limit for varus angulation was normal as long as the lateral collateral ligament was intact. When the lateral collateral ligament was cut, the limit increased 4.5 degrees (approximately 4.5 millimeters of additional joint opening) when the knee was partially flexed (to 15 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There was a wide variation between subjects, although 95 per cent of them had a resting pressure of less than twelve millimeters of mercury. This pressure was not consistently or significantly affected by age. The pressure increased with exercise, but in an average of 3.4 minutes after the exercise was stopped it returned to within one millimeter of mercury of the resting pressure. The resting pressure was also found to be affected by the positions of the lower extremity and the trunk during measurement. To reduce this effect, it is recommended that for measurement of pressure in the lower extremity the patient should be lying supine and the big toe should be pointing vertically upward.\r"

During 5 weeks of bedrest, the mean urinary calcium excretion rose during the first week and remained elevated (from 5.68 to approximately 7.50 mmol/day). Mean urinary phosphorus excretion increased by the second week of bedrest and remained elevated (from 2.70 to approximately 30.6 mmol/day). Urinary sodium and uric acid excretion rose slightly, as did urinary magnesium. Urinary pH, oxalate, and citrate changed slightly or not at all. Owing to these biochemical alterations, urinary saturation of calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, and monosodium urate increased significantly during bedrest, but that of uric acid did not change. The inhibitor activity against the spontaneous nucleation of brushite (CaHPO4.2H2O) and calcium oxalate was not altered significantly by bedrest. Thus, the propensity for the crystallization of stone-forming calcium salts was enhanced by bedrest, suggesting that immobilization may confer increased risk for the formation of calcium-containing renal stones.\r"

To assess the effect of hyperandrogenism on adrenal steroidogenesis, seven normal ovulatory women were studied on 2 days during the early follicular phase of their cycles. Plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-Prog), 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, androstenedione (Adione), testosterone (T), 11-deoxycortisol, and cortisol concentrations were measured every 15 min for 3 h after iv injection of 0.25 mg ACTH (day 1) and pretreatment with dexamethasone on each day. On the second study day, T (80 micrograms/h) was infused iv for 5 h, and ACTH was given after 2 h of T infusion. The T infusion raised mean serum T levels from 1.2 +/- 0.3 (+/- SE) to 8.6 +/- 0.6 nmol/L. The maximum incremental (delta max) plasma Adione response to ACTH was significantly higher (2.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.2 +/- 0.4 nmol/L; P less than 0.009) during the T infusion, while the delta max responses of the other steroids did not change. There was an increase in the delta max 17-Prog to cortisol ratio (4.9 +/- 0.7 to 7.0 +/- 1.0; P less than 0.05), but no change in the delta max 17-Prog to Adione or 17-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA ratios and no changes in the delta max delta 5- to delta 4-steroid ratios. These data suggest that acute T elevations result in subtle inhibition of 21-and/or 11 beta-hydroxylase activities, but not in 17-20-desmolase or 3 beta-ol activities.\r"

  ".W": "We wished to determine whether different types of dietary protein might have different effects on calcium metabolism and on the propensity for renal stone formation. Fifteen young normal subjects were studied during three 12-day dietary periods during which their diet contained vegetable protein, vegetable and egg protein, or animal protein. While these three diets were constant with respect to Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, and quantity of protein, they had progressively higher sulfur contents. As the fixed acid content of the diets increased, urinary calcium excretion increased from 103 +/- 15 ( +/- SEM) mg/day (2.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/day) on the vegetarian diet to 150 +/- 13 mg/day (3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/day) on the animal protein diet (P less than 0.02). Despite the increased urinary calcium excretion, there was a modest reduction of urinary cAMP excretion and serum PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels consistent with acid-induced bone dissolution. There was no change in fractional intestinal 47Ca absorption. The inability to compensate for the animal protein-induced calciuric response may be a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. The animal protein-rich diet was associated with the highest excretion of undissociated uric acid due to the reduction in urinary pH. Moreover, citrate excretion was reduced because of the acid load. However, oxalate excretion was lower than during the vegetarian diet [26 +/- 1 mg/day (290 +/- 10 mumol/day) vs. 39 +/- 2 mg/day (430 +/- 20 mumol/day); P less than 0.02]. Urinary crystallization studies revealed that the animal protein diet, when its electrolyte composition and quantity of protein were kept the same as for the vegetarian diet, conferred an increased risk for uric acid stones, but, because of opposing factors, not for calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones.\r"

These patients with elevated serum T3 to T4 ratios rarely have a remission of their hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to investigate thyroid iodine metabolism in such patients, whom we termed T3-predominant Graves' disease. Mean thyroid radioactive iodine uptake was 51.0 +/- 18.1% ( +/- SD) at 3 h, and it decreased to 38.9 +/- 20.1% at 24 h in 31 patients with T3-predominant Graves' disease during treatment. It was 20.0 +/- 11.4% at 3 h and increased to 31.9 +/- 16.0% at 24 h in 17 other patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease who had normal serum T3 and T4 levels and a normal serum T3 to T4 ratio during treatment (control Graves' disease). The activity of serum TSH receptor antibodies was significantly higher in the patients with T3-predominant Graves' disease than in control Graves' disease patients (60.5 +/- 19.2% vs. 20.4 +/- 18.2%; P less than 0.001). From in vitro studies of thyroid tissue obtained at surgery, both thyroglobulin content and iodine content in thyroglobulin were significantly lower in patients with T3-predominant Graves' disease than in the control Graves' disease patients. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity determined by a guaiacol assay was 0.411 +/- 0.212 g.u./mg protein in the T3-predominant Graves' disease patients, significantly higher than that in the control Graves' disease patients (0.129 +/- 0.112 g.u./mg protein; P less than 0.01). Serum TPO autoantibody levels determined by immunoprecipitation also were greater in T3-predominant Graves' disease patients than in control Graves' disease patients (52.6 +/- 27.7% vs. 32.4 +/- 11.4%; P less than 0.05). Binding of this antibody to TPO slightly inhibited the enzyme activity of TPO, but this effect of the antibody was similar in the two groups of patients. The data suggest enhanced iodine metabolism in the thyroid gland of patients with T3-predominant Graves' disease, which may relate to the discordant T3 overproduction in patients with this type of Graves' disease.\r"

After this finding we purified the normal human serum counterpart of these ascites proteins and studied its effects on bone resorption. The bone-resorbing properties of normal human serum alpha 2HS were examined in vitro over a wide dose range. This normal human serum glycoprotein had a biphasic effect on 45Ca2+ release from bone. More specifically, this protein stimulated bone resorption at the lower concentrations tested, with a maximum effect [treated over control ratio of 2.5 +/- 0.30 (+/- SE); P less than 0.01] at 40 micrograms/mL. In contrast, at doses above 40 micrograms/mL, a sharp decline in calcium mobilization occurred, with a return to baseline occurring above 80 micrograms/mL. These results suggest that serum alpha 2HS may participate in the regulation of bone metabolism in vivo.\r"

The immunohistochemical characterization of the cells was carried out using the monoclonal antibodies OKIa (class II MHC determinants), RFD1 and L25. These latter monoclonal antibodies react strongly with active dendritic cells in T-cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs (the interdigitating cells in lymph nodes and spleen). Antigen-presenting dendritic cells were defined as cells with an eccentric reniform nucleus, long cytoplasmic protrusions, and strong membrane-bound class II MHC positivity combined with little or no cytoplasmic acid phosphatase activity. According to these criteria normal human thyroid tissue contained a few dendritic cells; they were localized outside the thyroid follicles. These dendritic cells in normal thyroid tissue lacked the marker molecules identified by the monoclonal antibodies RFD1 and L25. In fact, the majority of the dendritic cells were strongly positive for the C3bi receptor (identified by the monoclonal antibody FK 24), which indicates a more monocyte/macrophage character of the cell. In Hashimoto's goiter, Graves' disease, and sporadic nontoxic goiter (which we consider an autoimmune thyroid disease) the numbers of dendritic cells were higher compared to those in the normal gland, and these dendritic cells were clearly positive for RFD1 and L25. The cells were often seen in contact with a few intrathyroidal lymphocytes, forming small lymphoid cell clusters. They were also found in the T-cell zones of larger well organized intrathyroidal lymphoid structures (focal thyroiditis). On ultrastructural examination the dendritic cells in Graves' glands, Hashimoto's goiter, and sporadic nontoxic goiter were similar to the interdigitating cells present in secondary lymphoid organs. The data suggest active involvement of dendritic cells in the immune process in the thyroids of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

Several investigators have reported beneficial effects of such treatment, but the dosages used and side-effects encountered differ in their reports. To clarify this issue, 26 consecutive premenopausal women with idiopathic hirsutism were prospectively evaluated during spironolactone treatment. Sixteen women initially received 100 mg spironolactone twice daily on days 4-21 of their menstrual cycles. In 11 women (68%), the dosage had to be decreased or the medication discontinued due to side-effects. The major side-effect, metrorrhagia with 14-day cycles, occurred in 9 women (56%). This side-effect, while not dangerous, was intolerable to these women. In one woman, spironolactone was discontinued because of urticaria and in another because of scalp hair loss. Ten women initially received 50 mg spironolactone twice daily on days 4-21 of their menstrual cycles. Two developed metrorrhagia, but no other side-effects were noted. Because of the incidence of metrorrhagia at higher dosages, we recommend that spironolactone be administered cyclically at a starting dosage of 50 mg twice daily on days 4-21 of the menstrual cycle. Alternatively, one may consider adding cyclical estrogen/progesterone therapy to continuous spironolactone therapy.\r"

In 10 normal women sampled during the early follicular phase, mean serum Adiol 3-G and total Adiol G levels were 2.64 +/- 0.64 nmol/L (124 +/- 30 ng/dL) and 14.9 +/- 1.5 nmol/L (697 +/- 69 ng/dL), respectively (17.4 +/- 3.6% of Adiol G was Adiol 3-G). In 4 normal men infused for 8 h with tritiated DHT, 17.4 +/- 3.4% of the resulting tritiated Adiol G was Adiol 3-G. These results indicate that Adiol 17-G is the predominant circulating form of Adiol G in normal men and women and that it is also the major Adiol G isomer derived from DHT.\r"

Twenty women were studied, including eight with severe infiltrative ophthalmopathy who had taken methimazole and T4 for at least 4 months, six with severe infiltrative ophthalmopathy who had undergone subtotal thyroidectomy and, therefore, required no antithyroid treatment, and six age-matched normal women. All were euthyroid. Each women received 0.54 mg/kg prednisolone as an iv bolus dose. Plasma total and unbound prednisolone concentrations were measured at multiple times during a 10-h study period by high pressure liquid chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. The clearance of both total and unbound prednisolone was increased significantly in the women receiving methimazole therapy compared to values in both control groups. The volume of distribution at steady state was similar in all groups. These results suggest that patients receiving methimazole have enhanced prednisolone metabolism and, therefore, they may require higher prednisolone doses.\r"

This melatonin increase in HA was due to an elevated peak amplitude (p less than 0.01) and extended duration (p less than 0.05). The latter was mostly due to a significant delay in the offset time of the amplified nocturnal melatonin secretion.\r"

Since the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby serum sex steroid concentrations are sensitive to thyroid status, we also measured serum testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG at each time. Stepwise T4 treatment resulted in gradual improvement in thyroid status. Concomitantly, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased in a linear fashion from a mean of 4.72 +/- 0.31 (+/- SEM) to 3.21 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) after the largest dose. In contrast, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased, although not in a dose-dependent fashion, from 1.61 +/- 0.07 to 1.44 +/- 0.05 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) after the largest dose. Serum SHBG increased along with improvement of thyroid function, but this increase did not have major impact on the changes in LDL during T4 treatment, as judged by multiple regression analysis. Thus, serum LDL correlated independently only with T4 (r = -0.38; P less than 0.001). The serum HDL changes were almost exclusively due to those in the HDL2 subfraction, and these were related to HL activity, which increased from 13.4 +/- 1.76 to 18.9 +/- 2.08 U/L after the largest dose. We conclude that thyroid hormones regulated serum HDL (HDL2) cholesterol mainly through their effect on HL.\r"

There was a high degree of relative correlation between assays (r = 0.95-0.98), but absolute potency estimates differed. Assays 1 and 2 were almost identical. Assay 3 yielded serum GH levels about 65% those of assay 1 or 2 and 80% those of assay 4. Assay 4 gave intermediate values between the low readings in assay 3 and higher values in assay 1 and 2. We conclude that substantial variation occurs in potency estimates in different GH assays. Such differences can affect the interpretation of many GH provocative and sampling studies.\r"

The mean MCR in the 5 patients with sarcoidosis [40 +/- 9 (+/- SD) mL/min] was similar to that in 13 normal subjects (37 +/- 6 mL/min) and that in 9 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria and renal stones (35 +/- 4 mL/min). However, the mean serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentration was significantly higher in the patients with sarcoidosis (211 +/- 60 pmol/L) than in either of the other 2 groups. The mean 1,25-(OH)2D production rate was markedly elevated in the patients with sarcoidosis (12.4 +/- 5.3 mumol/day), being more than 2-fold greater than the normal mean value (5.4 +/- 1.2 mumol/day). The highest production rates were found in patients with hypercalcemia, whereas subjects with hypercalciuria had production rates comparable to those in the patients with absorptive hypercalciuria. These data indicate that there is no impairment in the clearance of 1,25-(OH)2D in patients with sarcoidosis and that the elevated serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels are due to an increase in its production rate.\r"

Analysis of autoantibody systems in this and related autoimmune disorders can provide information of etiologic and pathogenetic significance. We report here a previously unrecognized autoantibody to the 90,000-D heat-shock protein, hsp90, a molecule thought to have important functions in the cellular response to stress, virus-induced transformation, steroid hormone receptor action, and cellular activation. Autoantibodies to hsp90 were exclusively of the IgG class, and were detected in approximately 50% of unselected patients with SLE and 2/6 patients with idiopathic polymyositis. Anti-hsp90 antibodies were not detected in sera from 10 normal subjects, 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, or 7 patients with scleroderma. The identity of this major intracytoplasmic antigen was established by its specific removal from nonionic detergent cell lysates following immunoabsorption with monospecific rabbit anti-hsp90, and by demonstration of increased synthesis following a 10-min 45 degrees C heat shock. These data define the frequent occurrence of a novel autoantibody to a major heat-shock protein in patients with SLE.\r"

Sonicated cell suspensions of isolated glomeruli from these patients contained markedly augmented levels of procoagulant activity (PCA) compared with the levels found in normal glomeruli. This PCA was characterized as tissue factor by its functional dependence on Factors VII and V, independence of Factors VIII and XII, inhibition by concanavalin A and phospholipase C, and association with cell membranes. Its coagulant activity was also inhibited by a specific monoclonal anti-human tissue factor antibody. Tissue factor could be identified in glomeruli from these two patients by indirect immunofluorescence using this antibody. These studies implicate extrinsic pathway activation via tissue factor in intraglomerular deposition of fibrin in these patients. Activated monocytes, known to be a potent source of procoagulant activity and seen in large numbers within glomeruli from these patients, are a likely source of this tissue factor.\r"

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis served as a model of human 1,25-D deficiency; they were also studied when they had abnormally high serum 1,25-D concentrations as a result of short periods of treatment with exogenous 1,25-D. Normal subjects were studied for comparison. The amount of calcium secreted into the duodenum by the digestive glands was found to be trivial compared to the calcium content of normal or even low calcium meals; therefore, values for net and true net calcium absorption differed only slightly. There was a linear correlation between true net calcium absorption and serum 1,25-D concentration. By extrapolating the short distance to a zero value for serum 1,25-D, D-independent true net calcium absorption was estimated. By subtracting D independent from true net calcium absorption, values for D-dependent absorption were obtained. For a given level of meal calcium intake, D-dependent calcium absorption was found to be directly proportional to serum 1,25-D concentration. At any given value for serum 1,25-D, absorption via the D-dependent mechanism was approximately the same with a low (120 mg) calcium meal as it was when meal calcium intake was increased to 300 mg. We interpret this to mean that the D-dependent mechanism is saturated or nearly saturated by low calcium meals. The D-independent absorption/secretion mechanism resulted in secretion (a loss of body calcium in the feces) when intake was low (120 mg per meal) and absorption when intake was normal. All of the increment in calcium absorption that occurs when low or normal calcium meals are supplemented with extra calcium is mediated by the D-independent mechanism.\r"

We have examined 20 different individuals from 10 spherocytosis kindreds and 2 elliptocytosis kindreds to determine the effects of different levels of spectrin deficiency on the viscoelastic properties of the erythrocyte membrane. Micropipettes were used to perform single-cell micromechanical measurements of approximately 1,000 individual cells to determine the membrane elastic shear modulus, the apparent membrane bending stiffness, and whole cell recovery time constant for the different cell populations. The membrane viscosity was calculated by the product of the shear modulus and the recovery time constant. Results show correlation between the fractional reduction in shear modulus and the fractional reduction in spectrin content (determined by spectrin radioimmunoassay) and spectrin density (determined by the ratios of spectrin to band 3 on electrophoresis gels) suggesting that membrane shear elasticity is directly proportional to the surface density of spectrin on the membrane (P less than 0.001). The apparent membrane bending stiffness is also reduced in proportion to the density of spectrin (P less than 0.001). The membrane viscosity is reduced relative to control (P less than 0.001), but the nature of the relationship between spectrin density and membrane viscosity is less clearly defined. These studies document striking relationships between partial deficiencies of erythrocyte spectrin and specific viscoelastic properties of the mutant membranes.\r"

Four animals each received doses of 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 mg/kg of purified AP-2 IgG, and three animals were given 1.0 mg/kg of the F(ab)2 fragment of AP-2. Five additional animals were given 10 mg/kg LJ-CP8 IgG. At the highest dose, radiolabeled AP-2 IgG bound to an average of 33,000 sites on the circulating platelets. Serial measurements included platelet count, bleeding time, platelet aggregation (induced by ADP, collagen, and gamma-thrombin), and 111In-platelet deposition onto Dacron vascular grafts. Bleeding times were markedly prolonged after injection of 1.0 mg/kg AP-2 IgG (19.2 +/- 3.4 min), 1.0 mg/kg AP-2 F(ab)2 (16.5 +/- 1.8 min), and 10 mg/kg LJ-CP8 (greater than 30 min) vs. control studies (4.6 +/- 0.2 min), and remained prolonged for 48 h. With each antibody platelet aggregation was initially reduced or absent, with partial recovery over 48 h in a manner that was inversely related to dose. AP-2, both whole IgG and F(ab)2 fragment, but not LJ-CP8, caused a dose-dependent reduction (20-46%) in the circulating platelet count over 24 h. Neither AP-2 nor LJ-CP8 caused a reduction in intraplatelet platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, or [14C]serotonin. Graft-associated platelet thrombus formation was reduced by 73% (1.0 mg/kg AP-2 IgG and 10 mg/kg LJ-CP8) and 53% (1.0 mg/kg AP-2 F(ab)2) relative to control values. In contrast, neither heparin (100 U/kg) nor aspirin (32.5 mg/kg twice a day) showed antithrombotic efficacy in this model. Thus, antibodies that functionally alter the platelet GP IIb/IIIa complex may produce immediate, potent, and transient, antihemostatic, and antithrombotic effects.\r"

Hearts were equilibrated for 30 min, subjected to 10 min of global, normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemia, and reperfused for 15, 30, and 60 min. Hearts treated with allopurinol (100 microM) exhibited greater ATP levels and improved function during reperfusion than did untreated control hearts. Hearts treated with hypoxanthine (100 microM), the substrate for xanthine oxidase, also showed increased ATP and functional recovery compared with controls. These results suggest that allopurinol may protect the globally ischemic myocardium by enhancing the salvage of hypoxanthine for reincorporation into adenine nucleotides.\r"

MDA production at ASA concentrations from 1.2 to 4.6 mM was greater than control (P less than 0.004). Peak MDA values were observed with 4.6 mM ASA, 39.58 +/- 6.73 nmol MDA/mg protein vs. 16.16 +/- 2.85 (P less than 0.004). Higher concentrations of ASA were inhibitory compared with the value at 4.6 mM (P less than 0.001). Aspirin had similar effects on MDA production by mouse liver mitochondria. MDA production with either ASA or buffer was completely suppressed by the potent iron-chelating agents desferrioxamine and alpha,alpha' dipyridyl when these were added to the microsomal preparations. Since MDA production in this system is known to be affected by iron-chelating agents (enhanced at low concentration, inhibited at higher concentration), the iron-chelating properties of ASA were investigated. Conductivity titration curves of Fe(OH)3 added to water or ASA suggested that the ASA was complexing with iron. The presence of an iron-ASA complex was established by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of the solution from this study. We conclude that aspirin enhances MDA production by hepatic microsomes and mitochondria via an aspirin-iron chelate and that this represents at least one mechanism by which aspirin may produce liver damage.\r"

She demonstrated progressive skeletal muscle weakness and developmental delay. Her plasma total carnitine level (35 nmol/ml) was low-normal, but was esterified to an abnormal degree (55% vs. control of less than 10%). Her skeletal muscle total carnitine level was low (7.6 nmol/mg protein vs. control of 14 +/- 2 nmol/mg protein) and was 75% esterified. Mild lipid deposition was noted in type I muscle fibers. Fibroblasts from this patient had 50% of control levels of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity towards butyryl-CoA as substrate at a concentration of 50 muM in a fluorometric assay based on the reduction of electron transfer flavoprotein. All of this residual activity was inhibited by an antibody against medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. These data demonstrated that medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase accounted for 50% of the activity towards the short-chain substrate, butyryl-CoA, under these conditions, but that antibody against that enzyme could be used to unmask the specific and virtually complete deficiency of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in this patient. Fibroblasts from her parents had intermediate levels of activity towards butyryl-CoA, consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of this metabolic defect.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy are inherited disorders in which long-chain, saturated fatty acids (LCFA) accumulate in various tissues. A mechanism by which LCFA cause the endocrine and neurological dysfunction characteristic of these diseases is proposed based on in vitro response of human adrenocortical cells to ACTH in the presence of various fatty acids. Human adrenocortical cells cultured in the presence of 5 microM hexacosanoic (C26:0) or lignoceric (C24:0) acids showed decreased basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol release compared with cells cultured without exogenous fatty acids or in the presence of linoleic acid (C18:2). Measurement of fluorescence polarization demonstrates a significant increase in the membrane microviscosity of cells cultured in the presence of LCFA. It is hypothesized that cells exposed to LCFA have increased membrane microviscosity with a consequent decrease in their ability to respond to ACTH. This decrease in trophic support may contribute to the adrenal insufficiency and atrophy in patients with ALD.\r"

We recently studied a patient of German descent with peripheral neuropathy and bowel dysfunction. Biopsied rectal tissue contained amyloid that stained with anti-human prealbumin. Amino acid sequence analysis of the patient's plasma prealbumin revealed both normal and variant prealbumin molecules, with the variant containing a tyrosine at position 77 instead of serine. We predicted a single nucleotide change in codon 77 of the variant prealbumin gene, which we then detected in the patient's DNA using the restriction enzyme SspI and a specifically tailored genomic prealbumin probe. DNA tests of other family members identified several gene carriers. This is the sixth prealbumin variant implicated in amyloidosis, and adds to the accumulating evidence that the prealbumin amyloidoses are more varied and prevalent than previously thought.\r"

To determine whether KCl co-transport exists in the basolateral membrane of mammalian renal proximal tubule, isolated rabbit proximal straight tubules (S2 segment) were perfused in vitro, and intracellular activities of potassium and chloride (aKi, aCli) were measured by double-barreled ion-selective microelectrodes. aCli did not change when basolateral membrane voltage was altered by application of a direct current through perfusion pipette. aCli changes in response to bath chloride elimination were not affected by current application as well, indicating that the basolateral chloride transport is electroneutral. An increase in potassium concentration of the bath fluid from 5 to 20 mM reversibly increased aCli by 10 mM. This response of aCli to a change in the bath potassium concentration was also observed when luminal chloride was removed, or ambient sodium was totally removed. aKi significantly decreased by 5 mM when chloride was removed from the bath. These data demonstrate the existence of an electroneutral Na+-independent KCl co-transport in the basolateral membrane of the rabbit proximal tubule. Calculated electrochemical driving force was favorable for the movement of KCl from the cell to the peritubular fluid.\r"

With 0.5% human hypopituitary serum (HPS), hGH increased thymidine incorporation (TI) over serum-free medium dose responsively, with half-maximal effect at 10 ng/ml (0.5 nM) (hGH 127 +/- 8.8%; IGF-I 107 +/- 1.7% [SEM]) (n = 10). Similarly, with 0.5% HPS, hGH and IGF-I increased cell replication by 172 +/- 8.2% and 169 +/- 25%, respectively (n = 4). Specific IGF-I monoclonal antibody (Sm1.2) dose dependently blunted TI stimulated by 10 ng/ml hGH or IGF-I (at 1:1000, 38 +/- 6.5% and 30 +/- 14% reduction, respectively). Sm1.2 also reduced cell replication by both 10 ng/ml hGH and IGF-I, respectively, to 32% and 42% of stimulated values. Dexamethasone (0.1 microM) synergistically enhanced TI by both IGF-I and hGH. A 28-h time course for TI showed that hGH stimulated a similar peak to IGF-I, lagging in its effect by 4-10 h. We have provided further evidence that hGH stimulates growth of cultured human fibroblasts via local IGF-I production, consistent with IGF-I's paracrine-autocrine role.\r"

Healthy subjects had a mean arteriovenous increment in plasma DHPG in the arm (10%, P less than 0.05), whereas sympathectomized patients had a mean arteriovenous decrement in DHPG in the affected limb (mean decrease 21%, P less than 0.05 compared with healthy subjects). Tilt and yohimbine, which stimulate, and clonidine, which inhibits, release of endogenous NE, produced highly correlated changes in plasma NE and DHPG (r = 0.94). Pretreatment with desipramine abolished DHPG responses to yohimbine while enhancing NE responses. To attain a given increase in plasma DHPG, about a tenfold larger increment in arterial NE was required during NE infusion than during release of endogenous NE. When plasma NE was markedly suppressed after administration of clonidine, plasma DHPG decreased to a plateau level of 700-800 pg/ml. The results indicate that (i) plasma DHPG in humans is derived mainly from sympathetic nerves; (ii) increments in plasma DHPG during stimulation of NE release result from uptake of NE into sympathetic nerve endings and subsequent intraneuronal conversion to DHPG; (iii) plasma DHPG under basal conditions probably is determined mainly by net leakage of NE into the axonal cytoplasm from storage vesicles; and (iv) increments in NE concentrations at neuronal uptake sites can be estimated by simultaneous measurements of DHPG and NE during NE infusion and NE release. Measurement of NE and DHPG provides unique clinical information about sympathetic function.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to establish the mechanism for the raised serum estrogen levels that occur in male rats with portal hypertension and resultant portal bypass. Using the portal vein ligated (PVL) rat model, we evaluated plasma steroid hormone concentrations, metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of estradiol, and hepatic metabolism of androstenedione to estrogens and other products. In contrast to serum testosterone levels that were reduced, serum androstenedione levels were normal in the PVL rat. Estradiol MCR was measured by a constant intravenous infusion technique and was found to be similar in PVL and control animals. Androstenedione MCR was determined during constant intravenous infusion of [3H]androstenedione, and the resultant radiolabeled steroids present in plasma were separated by thin layer chromatography. The MCR of androstenedione was not diminished in PVL rats compared with controls. However, there was a sevenfold increase in the plasma estradiol derived from [3H]androstenedione in rats with portal bypass. Examination of radiolabel excreted in bile during infusion of [3H]androstenedione showed that 25-46% of this steroid was converted to estradiol in PVL rats compared with less than 3% in control male rats (P less than 0.001). Moreover, there was a selective reduction in the excretion of 16 alpha-hydroxyandrostenedione, a finding which suggested that the metabolism of androstenedione via this pathway was decreased. Androstenedione 16 alpha-hydroxylation is known to be catalyzed by a male-specific cytochrome P-450 isoform, P-450UT-A. We conclude that raised plasma estradiol levels after portal bypass in male rats are due to increased production rates, resulting in turn from enhanced aromatization of androstenedione to estradiol. On the basis of the observed specific changes in androstenedione hydroxylation pathways, it is proposed that alterations in levels of sex-specific forms of cytochrome P-450 occur in male rats with portal bypass and could account for the enhanced formation of estradiol.\r"

  ".U": "88087900\r", 
  ".W": "The appearance of vacuoles inside acinar cells characterizes an early stage of development in different models of acute pancreatitis and, possibly, also in human disease. The vacuoles have been shown to contain both digestive and lysosomal enzymes. This abnormal admixture may have important implications for the pathogenesis of pancreatitis because the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B can activate trypsinogen and may, by this way, trigger pancreatic autodigestion. For the activation process of trypsinogen by cathepsin B, however, an acidic pH is required. This study, therefore, looked for evidence of vacuole acidification in two different models of acute pancreatitis. Edematous pancreatitis was induced in rats by hyperstimulation with cerulein and hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in mice by feeding a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet. Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated at different times after induction of pancreatitis and incubated with 50 microM of acridine orange to identify acidic intracellular compartments. As shown in previous work, zymogen granules are the main acidic compartment of normal acinar cells; they remained acidic throughout the course of pancreatitis in both models. Vacuoles became increasingly more frequent in both models as pancreatitis progressed. Throughout development of pancreatitis, vacuoles accumulated acridine orange indicating an acidic interior. Addition of a protonophore (10 microM monensin or 5 microM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone [CCCP] or a weak base (5 mM NH4Cl) completely and rapidly abolished acridine orange fluorescence inside both zymogen granules and vacuoles providing further evidence for an acidic interior. The acidification of vacuoles seen in two different models of pancreatitis may be an important requirement for activation of trypsinogen by cathepsin B and thus for the development of acute pancreatitis.\r"

In particular, PS, which comprises approximately 13% of total RBC membrane phospholipids, is normally restricted entirely to the cytoplasmic leaflet. However, molecular mechanisms that regulate this asymmetric distribution of phospholipids are largely unknown. We examined elliptocytic RBCs that completely lacked protein 4.1 (HE [4.1 degrees]), but contained normal amounts of all other peripheral membrane proteins, and found approximately 10% of total membrane PS was accessible in the exoplasmic leaflet of these membranes. Inside out vesicles (IOVs) derived from HE [4.1 degrees] RBCs bound fewer PS liposomes than did IOVs derived from normal RBCs. Normal IOVs that were depleted of proteins 2.1 (ankyrin), 4.1, and 4.2 bound fewer PS liposomes similar to HE [4.1 degrees] IOVs, and repletion with protein 4.1 restored PS liposome binding to control levels. Addition of purified protein 4.1 to PS liposomes resulted in saturable binding with the extent of binding being proportional to the liposome PS content. Our data suggests that human RBC protein 4.1 is a PS binding protein and may be involved in the molecular mechanisms that stabilize PS in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the human RBC plasma membrane.\r"

  ".U": "88087905\r", 
  ".W": "Calcitonin is secreted by the C cells of the thyroid in response to a raised serum calcium, and acts on bone to lower serum calcium. The C cells have specific receptors for the dihydroxymetabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, calcitonin stimulates the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the kidney. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), the third calciotrophic hormone, is also trophic to the renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3, and in turn 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits PTH gene transcription and synthesis. We report here the marked inhibition of calcitonin gene transcription by the injection of physiologically relevant doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to normal rats that did not raise serum calcium. Calcitonin mRNA levels after 100 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased to 6% of basal at 6 h and 4% at 48 h, and a dose response showed a marked effect even after 12.5 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3, with no appreciably greater effect with larger doses (up to 200 pmol). Control genes, actin, thyroglobulin (thyroid follicular cells), somatostatin (thyroid C-cells) were not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Gel blots showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased calcitonin mRNA levels without any change in its size. In vitro nuclear transcription showed that 1,25(OH)2D3-treated (100 pmol) rats' calcitonin transcription was 10% of control, while thyroglobulin and actin were 100%. We propose that calcium is the major regulator of PTH and calcitonin secretion, while 1,25(OH)2D3 is an important regulator of PTH and calcitonin gene transcription. We believe this to be the first demonstration of an effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the C cells thereby establishing a new target organ and site of action of vitamin D. Calcitonin is trophic to 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis, which in turn inhibits calcitonin synthesis, which are the components of a new endocrinological feedback loop.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of activation sequence of an atrioventricular junctional reentrant (AVJRe) circuit, before delivery of an extrastimulus, has received little attention in studies concerned with clinical tachycardias. In this study a change in activation sequence was accomplished using bidirectional activation (V-A sequential pacing) during the basic drive (V1A1-V1A1). It was noted that, compared with an atrial extrastimulus (A2) after an atrial drive (A1-A1), earlier activation (by V1 impulse of the V1A1-V1A1 drive) consistently improved conduction, or decreased refractoriness, or both, in the anterograde as well as the retrograde pathway of the AVJRe circuit. In all patients, five with AV nodal reentry and six with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, reentrant tachycardia could be prevented during V-A sequential pacing. In four of eleven patients, reentry was prevented despite achieving the so-called critical atrioventricular nodal delays that had previously caused reentry during control study. This finding suggested that conduction delay necessary for reentry was related to the site of block, which in turn was affected by V-A sequential pacing. We concluded that changing the activation sequence during basic drive modulates conduction and refractoriness in AVJRe circuits, and allows the study of a wide range of electrophysical factors that prevent or permit reentry.\r"

Using a sensitive assay for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrated complete deficiency of enzyme activity in the patient and partial deficiency of enzyme activity in her father and children consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

Similar results were obtained with IgG-anti-IgG and type II collagen-anticollagen II human antibodies. Cross-linking was defined as the antibody remaining attached to plastic-bound antigen after extraction with 3 M MgCl2 and 0.1 N HCl solutions. The effects of addition of oxygen radical scavengers, heme-enzyme inhibitors, and omission of Cl- indicated that the cross-linking process was mediated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system. Cross-linking was also obtained with cell lysates, polymorphonuclear granules, and purified human myeloperoxidase in the presence of a steady flux of H2O2 provided by glucose oxidase-glucose. Cross-linking by the cell-free systems was also abolished by sodium azide or omission of chloride ions. Cross-linked immune complexes were also generated by incubation with 20 to 50 microM solutions of freshly distilled hypochlorous acid. Addition of 10 mM hypochlorous acid to soluble IgG resulted in the formation of protein precipitates insoluble in 5 M guanidine, 0.1 N HCl, or boiling 2.3 M sodium dodecyl sulfate-1.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The remaining soluble IgG contained fluorescent high molecular aggregates (ex: 360 nm; em: 454 nm). Oxidative cross-linking of antigen-antibody molecules, and of immune complexes to connective tissue macromolecules may play a pathogenic role in acute and chronic inflammatory processes.\r"

We studied the platelet as a potential source of cholesterol for esterification by macrophages because (a) platelets are rich in free cholesterol, (b) they adhere to macrophages early in atherogenesis, and (c) vascular injury can induce foam cell formation in the absence of hyperlipoproteinemia. We found that washed, activated human platelets from normocholesterolemic donors stimulated cholesteryl ester formation by the human monocyte-derived cell, U-937. Platelet cholesterol, released from platelets activated with calf skin collagen, was approximately equipotent at donating cholesterol to U-937 cells for esterification as normal human low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation by activated human platelets demonstrated both concentration and time dependence. When hypercholesterolemic donors were studied, it was found that increasing plasma levels of cholesterol correlated directly with the ability of these hypercholesterolemic platelets to support cholesteryl ester synthesis by U-937 cells. Cholesterol-donating activity was also found in a 1,000-g supernatants of activated platelets. These observations point to a new and potentially important role for platelets in atherogenesis and suggest a mechanism for foam cell formation in the absence of marked hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of administration of N-desulfated/acetylated heparin, almost completely devoid of anticoagulant activity, on the progression of renal disease was examined in rats with 13/4 nephrectomy. Three groups of rats with 13/4 nephrectomy were studied. Group I (control, n = 11) received 0.15 ml of 0.15 M NaCl subcutaneously twice daily for 5 wk; group 2 (n = 11) received 0.15 ml twice daily of N-desulfated/acetylated heparin (5.4 mg/ml; less than 0.5 U/ml); group 3 (n = 9) received 0.15 ml twice daily of standard beef lung heparin (5.4 mg/ml; 977 U/ml). Clearances and renal histological studies were done at the end of 5 wk of heparin or saline administration. Rats given the heparin preparations had significantly higher inulin clearances (2.55 +/- 0.38 ml/min per body weight (BW) for group 2, or 2.60 +/- 0.24 ml/min per kg BW for group 3) than control rats (1.59 +/- 0.20 ml/min per kg BW). Histological analysis revealed a greater number of glomeruli with segmental or global sclerosis, hyalinosis, or fibrosis (36.6%) in control rats than in rats receiving N-desulfated/acetylated heparin (6.2%) or standard heparin (3.0%). Blood pressure averaged 169.4 +/- 6.2 mmHg in controls, 119.1 +/- 6.1 in rats of group 2, and 124.3 +/- 2.5 in rats of group 3. The values for blood pressure were significantly lower in the two groups receiving heparin than in controls. These studies indicate that a heparin preparation, almost completely devoid of anticoagulant properties, affords the same degree of protection against progression of renal disease as does standard heparin in rats with subtotal renal ablation. It is suggested that other biological properties of heparin may be responsible for the effects observed.\r"

Using conventional virus culture and a subgenomic cloned CMV DNA probe to detect viral DNA within leukocytes, we studied the virus-cell interactions involved in immunocompromised patients with viremic CMV infection. CMV was recovered by culture in 17/17 samples enriched for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Viral DNA was detected by dot-blot hybridization in 16/17 (94%). In contrast, samples enriched for mononuclear cells yielded infectious CMV in culture in only 7/15 (47%) instances; nonetheless, viral DNA was present in 16/17 samples probed. The quantity of CMV DNA in polymorphonuclear cells was significantly greater than in mononuclear leukocytes (mean 13.1 vs. 9.1 estimated viral genome equivalents per 100 cells, respectively), and CMV was always recovered from these cells regardless of the amount of viral DNA present. Yet, when the amounts of CMV DNA were virtually identical in granulocytes and mononuclear cells (6.3 and 7.1 genomic equivalents, respectively) collected simultaneously, infectious CMV could not be recovered from mononuclear cells. Although several interpretations are possible, these data are consistent with the view that CMV exists within granulocytes in a mature infectious form during viremia. The virus interactions with mononuclear cells appear to be more complex, particularly in those cells that contain CMV DNA but do not yield infectious virus.\r"

The numbers, erythropoietin independence, and cycling behavior of all detectable classes of erythroid, granulopoietic, and multilineage progenitors were then evaluated and the results obtained compared with preculture values. Time course studies showed that the long-term marrow culture system supports the continuous proliferation of primitive neoplastic progenitor cells from PV patients for many weeks. However, these progenitors fail to respond to signals from the adherent layer that return their counterparts in normal long-term marrow cultures to a quiescent state 5-7 d after each medium change. This abnormal cycling behavior of PV cells in the long-term culture system appears to mimic that operative in vivo, where primitive hemopoietic progenitors are also in a continuous state of turnover, in contrast to similar primitive progenitor compartments in normal individuals, which are quiescent. The long-term marrow culture system thus offers new possibilities for the further analysis of abnormal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clonal expansion at the stem cell level in PV.\r"

To quantitate this variability, this study employed a new protocol of programmed stimulation in which the number of extrastimuli required for tachycardia induction was the only major stimulation variable. This protocol was applied to 18 consecutive patients with previously documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia due to coronary artery disease. One to seven extrastimuli were available for arrhythmia induction if required. Each patient underwent programmed stimulation in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs on 3 separate days with a mean interval of 5 +/- 2.7 days between studies. A sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was inducible in all studies with less than or equal to 4 extrastimuli; the mean number of extrastimuli required was 2.4 +/- 0.8. Day to day variability in the number of extrastimuli required for tachycardia induction was observed in the majority of patients (72%). Eleven patients (61%) varied by one extrastimulus over the three control studies, and two patients (11%) varied by two extrastimuli. At analysis of variance, the 95% confidence interval for the degree of day to day variability was +/- 1 extrastimulus from the mean number required in the three studies. Multiple configurations of induced ventricular tachycardia were frequently observed at repeat studies and occurred in 15 patients (83%). In conclusion, spontaneous day to day variability in mode of induction of ventricular tachycardia in the absence of drugs is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Direct endocardial recording from a discrete region of slow conduction in the left ventricle was performed in a patient during sustained ventricular tachycardia. The tachycardia had a right bundle branch block and superior axis configuration with the earliest site of endocardial activation in the posterolateral left ventricle. At this site, the left ventricular electrogram during the tachycardia displayed two deflections with distinctly different responses to rapid pacing. During rapid pacing from the right ventricular apex, one deflection was transiently entrained, representing activation of the ventricle distal to a region of slow conduction in the reentrant circuit. However, the other deflection was not entrained and arose from activation proximal to this region. At a critically rapid pacing rate, interruption of the tachycardia was associated with conduction block in the region of slow conduction, as demonstrated by dissociation of the two deflections on the posterolateral left ventricular electrogram. At pacing rates that transiently entrained but did not terminate the tachycardia, decremental properties of conduction were demonstrated in the region of slow conduction, but not in the rest of the reentrant circuit. These responses of the posterolateral left ventricular electrogram to pacing during ventricular tachycardia strongly suggest that the recordings bracketed a discrete region of slow conduction in the left ventricle that was critical for the maintenance of ventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that this region of slow conduction in the left ventricle had decremental conduction properties and was the site of block during rapid pacing at rates sufficient to interrupt the tachycardia.\r"

Late electrophysiologic studies (mean 17 +/- 4 weeks) were repeated in 23 patients on a maintenance dose of 400 mg/day. At control study, all patients had inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia in 35, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4, ventricular fibrillation in 3), while after amiodarone loading (1,200 mg daily) 4 (10.5%) of the 42 patients developed noninducible ventricular arrhythmias. At late study, an additional 6 (26%) of the 23 patients with inducible arrhythmias at early study developed noninducible arrhythmias. The cycle length of induced ventricular tachycardia increased from 275 +/- 61 ms at control study to 340 +/- 58 ms at early study (p = 0.001). A further increase in ventricular tachycardia cycle length was noted in patients who underwent both early and late study (341 +/- 38 versus 375 +/- 63 ms, p less than 0.05). The percent of induced tachycardias that were clinically tolerated increased as patients were treated longer with amiodarone (control = 22%, early = 34%, late = 53%, p less than 0.001). Of the 23 patients who had both early and late electrophysiologic studies and were followed up for a mean of 21.7 months (range 4 to 47), there were no recurrences among the 6 patients with noninducible arrhythmias, but there were five recurrences among the 17 patients with persistently inducible arrhythmias. None of the four patients with noninducible arrhythmias at early study had a recurrence. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that: 1) The timing of programmed electrical stimulation will affect the results of the study in patients treated with oral amiodarone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the time course of postinfarction left ventricular dilation and to assess the impact of successful coronary thrombolysis, serial radionuclide left ventricular volume analyses were performed in 36 patients undergoing attempted thrombolysis for acute transmural myocardial infarction. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography and attempted thrombolysis within 7 h of the onset of symptoms. The site of coronary occlusion was the left anterior descending coronary artery in 17 patients, the right coronary artery in 18 and, in 1 patient, occluded bypass grafts to the right and left circumflex coronary arteries. Attempted reperfusion using a thrombolytic agent was successful in 22 individuals, occurring 5 +/- 1 h after the onset of symptoms.

However, the long-term benefits and complications of this procedure have not been established. Thirty-three patients underwent balloon dilation of unoperated coarctation using a percutaneous technique from November 1983 to December 1985. High quality biplane angiography was performed before and after dilation. Follow-up was obtained in 20 patients from 6 to 31 months following dilation. Angiography was performed at follow-up in 10, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging in 10 and both NMR imaging and angiography in 3. Balloon dilation was successful in 31 of the 33 patients with a decrease in average systolic pressure gradient from 46 to 8 mm Hg. There was no significant change in gradient on follow-up physical examination and at recatheterization in 10 patients. In addition, there was no evidence of restenosis on follow-up angiography and NMR imaging. In two patients, a small aneurysm formed at the site of balloon dilation. Balloon dilation of unoperated coarctation is effective, providing lasting relief of coarctation gradient and no evidence of restenosis. However, because of the uncertain natural history of aneurysms after dilation, this procedure should be considered investigational until further follow-up on patients with and without an aneurysm is available.\r"

The displacement of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve from the atrioventricular junction varied from minimal and isolated involvement of the septal leaflet to involvement of the mural and anterosuperior leaflets as well. This resulted in a wide range of physiologic \"atrialization\" of the right ventricle. The distal insertion of the valve leaflets also exhibited a spectrum of malformation. At one end the insertion was the normal focal variety, allowing free communication between the atrialized and functional parts of the right ventricle. At the other end there was abnormal linear attachment of the anterosuperior and mural leaflets to an anomalous muscular shelf at the junction between the inlet and apical trabecular portions of the right ventricle. The anteromedial commissure between the anterosuperior and the displaced septal leaflets provided a \"keyhole\" communication between the two ventricular compartments. Between these extremes were cases in which hyphenations along a locus of linear attachment allowed additional communications between the ventricular compartments. In light of these anatomic observations, cineangiograms of 26 patients with Ebstein's malformation were reviewed retrospectively. It was possible to classify the patients into three groups with focal, hyphenated and linear attachment, respectively. Size, ejection and displacement indexes of the functional right ventricle measured from the angiograms suggested that the severity of the malformation increased from focal attachment through hyphenated to linear attachment. Clinical observations relative to symptoms (cyanosis at rest, reduced exercise tolerance) and outcome supported this morphologic-angiographic grading.\r"

Whether postoperative electrophysiologic studies can identify patients at risk of developing this conduction disturbance is unknown. In this study, 57 children who underwent electrophysiologic investigation after correction of tetralogy of Fallot were followed up for 1 to 13 (mean 6.5) years after the investigation. One late death and two cases of late complete heart block occurred. The late death was due to ventricular arrhythmia and not to a conduction disturbance. The cases of late heart block occurred 2 and 5 years, respectively, after electrophysiologic study, and in both cases the patient had a prolonged HV interval; in one patient progressive lengthening of the HV interval could be demonstrated at two subsequent studies 1 year apart. Another five patients with a prolonged HV interval had normally conducted sinus rhythm up to 11 years after study. Atrial pacing at increasing rates (up to the occurrence of second degree atrioventricular block) during electrophysiologic study was the best means of predicting late heart block: of three patients with block below the bundle of His occurring at pacing rates less than 180/min, two developed late complete heart block. Thus, electrophysiologic testing of the conduction system after correction of tetralogy of Fallot is useful in predicting late complete heart block and should be performed in patients with a history of transient heart block after surgery and in those with a prolonged PR interval.\r"

Consequently, it may be useful for defining the pulmonary circulation in patients with pulmonary atresia, in whom opacification of these vessels can be problematic. Ten patients with pulmonary atresia were evaluated by gated NMR imaging. The morphology of the right ventricular outflow tract, the size and the course of the central pulmonary vessels and the source of the collateral supply to the lung were assessed. Central pulmonary arteries were identified and measured in 9 of the 10 patients. One patient had no detectable central pulmonary arteries. Angiography confirmed the NMR findings in all but two patients, in whom NMR scanning visualized a main pulmonary artery that was not seen on angiography. Collateral arteries arising from the aorta or the arch vessels, as well as intracardiac malformations and aortic arch anomalies, were identified in all 10 patients. In six patients with palliative surgery, NMR imaging correctly demonstrated all patent shunts. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging appears to be an effective noninvasive technique for evaluating patients with pulmonary atresia. However, tomographic thickness and spatial resolution are still limiting factors for this technique in infants.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary artery banding has become an infrequently used surgical technique. However, if a band was developed that could be relieved without the need for open heart surgery, it is likely that pulmonary artery banding would be used more frequently in the management of infants with congenital heart disease. Such a pulmonary artery band was placed in seven 1 week old mongrel puppies by using a loop of an absorbable suture material (Vicryl). One dog died at 2 months as a result of right ventricular failure. The remaining six dogs underwent cardiac catheterization and pulmonary balloon angioplasty at 6 months of age. After measuring pulmonary artery, right ventricular and aortic pressures and performing a right ventricular angiogram, balloon angioplasty of the band site was performed. A 20 mm balloon angioplasty catheter (Medi-Tech) was used in all dogs. Balloon angioplasty decreased right ventricular pressure from 101 +/- 19 to 42 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and right ventricular systolic outflow tract gradient from 59 +/- 14 to 7 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.03), and increased the size of the band site from 8.7 +/- 0.03 to 14.9 +/- 0.5 mm (p less than 0.01). All dogs were recatheterized 2 months after angioplasty and were then killed for pathologic evaluation. At follow-up catheterization, right ventricular pressure, right ventricular outflow tract gradient and pulmonary artery size at the band site remained at the values obtained immediately after angioplasty. Postmortem examination demonstrated that there was no evidence of pulmonary artery damage. Although these studies are preliminary, they suggest that a reversible pulmonary artery band can be performed.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between acute disproportionate infarct dilation and late postinfarct left ventricular remodeling was examined by implanting multiple radiopaque epicardial markers in the left ventricle of eight dogs and determining regional surface deformation after acute and chronic transmural infarction. Transmural injury was produced by combining coronary ligation with distal embolization of a rubber polymer. Dogs were anesthetized and studied before and 1 h, 24 h and 1 week after infarction. Marker positions were recorded by rapid biplane cineradiography, and three-dimensional coordinates were reconstructed by a computer-assisted tracking system. Regional deformation was expressed by a local surface area equal to the sum of multiple (three to four) triangles generated by marker triplets. As early as 1 h after infarction, end-diastolic area in the infarct region increased by 20.3 +/- 3.1%, while that in the remote region increased by only 7.9 +/- 3.5%. Both changes and the difference between them were significant. At 24 h after infarction, both territories continued to undergo dilation, this time to a similar extent (additional +10.3% in the remote region and +10.1% in the infarct region), thus maintaining the significant disproportionate infarct dilation. At 1 week, however, the infarct territory remained dilated with a mean end-diastolic area 31.4 +/- 3.1% above control, while that in the remote region returned to a net mean 8.5 +/- 4.7% increase. Thus, the major extent of disproportionate infarct dilation occurs within 1 h after transmural injury and is accompanied by remote dilation as a compensatory response. The extent of further infarct dilation achieved by 24 h is maintained in the chronic infarct, and compensatory mechanisms enable noninjured myocardium to become less dilated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A pair of ultrasonic crystals, an electromagnetic flow probe and a cuff occluder were placed on the left circumflex coronary artery in 12 mongrel dogs under sterile conditions. Reactive hyperemia after 20 s of coronary occlusion dilated the epicardial coronary artery by 120 +/- 14 micron (3.8 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.01) from 3.167 +/- 0.345 mm. This reactive dilation was abolished by flow-limiting coronary stenosis. However, vasodilation after nitroglycerin was 168 +/- 26 micron (5.1 +/- 0.5%) and 162 +/- 27 micron (4.9 +/- 0.6%), respectively, before and after flow limitation. After removal of the endothelium by a balloon catheter, dilation of the epicardial coronary artery after reactive hyperemia was markedly attenuated to 7 +/- 4 micron (p less than 0.01 versus before denudation), despite the presence of a similar degree of reactive hyperemia. The extent of coronary dilation after nitroglycerin was unchanged before and after de-endothelialization. Thus, the endothelium contributed to reactive dilation but not to the nitroglycerin-induced dilation. The negative feedback control of coronary diameter to changes in flow velocity may relate to the regulation of coronary artery tone.\r"

Twenty-two dogs underwent 3 (n = 8), 4 (n = 8) or 6 h (n = 6) of circumflex artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Effects of reperfusion on diastolic expansion were assessed in two ways: 1) change in mean radius of curvature of the infarct segment, and 2) change in the ratio of the length of the diameter from the center of the infarct zone to the opposite wall (septal-lateral diameter) to the length of the diameter perpendicular to this (anteroposterior diameter). Effects on systolic expansion were examined with quantitative two-dimensional echocardiographic systolic thickening analysis. Delayed reperfusion produced an immediate decrease in diastolic infarct expansion. The ratio of septal-lateral/anteroposterior diameters, which had increased with occlusion from a preocclusion baseline of 0.98 +/- 0.06 to 1.13 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.001), decreased with reperfusion to 1.02 +/- 0.07 at 15 min and 1.03 +/- 0.08 at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0.001). This was due solely to a decrease in the septal-lateral diameter. The radius of curvature of the infarcted segment increased from 2.1 +/- 0.5 cm before reperfusion to 2.74 +/- 0.8 cm at 15 min and 2.6 +/- 0.85 cm at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0.009). This occurred despite a significant (13.6%) decline in end-diastolic cavity area and is compatible with flattening of the reperfused infarct region. Systolic infarct expansion also improved slightly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using the Cox regression model in a randomly selected half of the patients, the prognostically independent clinical variables were weighted and arranged into a simple angina score: angina score = angina course X (1 + daily angina frequency) + ST-T changes, where angina course was equal to 3 if unstable or variant angina was present, 2 if the patient's angina was progressive with nocturnal episodes, 1 if it was progressive without nocturnal symptoms and 0 if it was stable; 6 points were added for the presence of \"ischemic\" ST-T changes. This angina score was then validated in an independent patient sample. The score was a more powerful predictor of prognosis than was any individual anginal descriptor. Furthermore, the angina score added significant independent prognostic information to the patient's age, sex, coronary anatomy and left ventricular function. Patients with three vessel disease and a normal ventricle (n = 1,233) had a 2 year infarction-free survival rate of 90% with an angina score of 0 and a 68% survival rate with an angina score greater than or equal to 9. With an ejection fraction less than 50% and three vessel disease (n = 1,116), the corresponding infarction-free survival figures were 76 and 56%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Group 1 (n = 5), core temperature was allowed to decline spontaneously. In Groups 2 (n = 6) and 3 (n = 6), core temperature was maintained at normothermic levels. Hypothermia impaired isovolumic relaxation markedly despite its lack of effect on ventricular volumes or ejection fraction. At 32.3 degrees C, tau 1/2, defined as the time needed for the left ventricular pressure at the time of peak negative rate of change of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) to fall by 50%, was increased by 129% 3 h after occlusion. In addition, at this temperature significant changes were found in heart rate, cardiac output, minute work, peak positive and peak negative dP/dt, systolic ejection time, mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, mean aortic pressure and end-diastolic pressure. Thus, hypothermia evolving under conditions of general anesthesia profoundly alters left ventricular function in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, a phenomenon that requires consideration and control in studies of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular function in experimental animals.\r"

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were scored according to a simplified 29 point QRS scoring system. Using Cox model analyses, QRS scores were found to provide strong prognostic information by themselves (p less than 0.0001). Higher QRS scores were associated with lower survival rates. Patients with a score of 0 had a 1 year survival rate of 95% and a 5 year survival rate of 88%; patients with a score of 10 or more had survival rates of 81 and 52%, respectively, at the same intervals. Directly compared with the presence or absence of Q waves on the ECG, QRS scores provided greater prognostic information (p less than 0.001). When compared with 13 individual factors previously shown to provide the greatest independent prognostic information, the QRS score was the third most powerful individual prognostic factor. It did not contribute independent prognostic information in combination with the whole group, but did provide independent information in combination with the six most predictive factors. Its prognostic information overlapped mostly with clinical factors related to heart failure, and combined best with clinical factors related to the severity of ongoing myocardial ischemia. Because it is inexpensive and simple and maximizes the prognostic information from the ECG, the simplified Selvester QRS scoring system can be a useful clinical descriptor for practitioners and clinical investigators.\r"

The study included all patients with primary mitral valve prolapse, irrespective of clinical condition at the onset, and excluded only those patients with \"secondary\" mitral valve prolapse attributable to an accompanying established disorder. The average follow-up period was 6.1 years (range 6 months to 20 years). Two patients died of a noncardiac cause. The clinical condition of 153 patients remained stable. In 27 patients a supraventricular tachycardia occurred that was readily controlled with medication and caused no serious clinical complications. In 20 patients signs of mitral regurgitation appeared, but the patients remained clinically asymptomatic. Serious complications developed in 100 patients. Sudden death, most likely due to ventricular fibrillation, occurred in three patients; documented ventricular fibrillation was seen in two. Ventricular tachycardia developed in 56 patients, but in all instances the rhythm disorder was managed effectively and durably with medication. Infective endocarditis occurred in 18 patients, 4 of whom died during treatment and 6 of whom needed mitral valve replacement. The remaining eight patients suffer from severe mitral regurgitation that will require surgery in the near future. Twenty-eight patients underwent mitral valve operation because of progressive regurgitation.

Because left ventricular filling also declines with aging in normal subjects, in this study the influence of regional ventricular diastolic asynchrony on global ventricular filling as a function of age was investigated in 66 normal volunteers aged 19 to 77 years (mean 42) by radionuclide angiography. No subject had systemic hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy. Indexes of left ventricular systolic function at rest did not vary with age, but rapid diastolic filling significantly declined with age: peak filling rate decreased (r = 0.69), time to peak filling rate increased (r = 0.53) and magnitude of rapid filling (% of left ventricular end-diastolic volume) decreased (r = 0.76) with aging. Left ventricular synchrony was assessed from regional volume curves derived by dividing the global ventricular region of interest into four quadrants. Indexes of systolic synchrony were unaffected by age, but regional variation in time to peak filling rate, an index of diastolic asynchrony, increased with aging (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001). Moreover, variation in time to peak filling rate correlated with global peak filling rate and magnitude of rapid filling (r = 0.48 and 0.54, p less than 0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis indicated that these effects were independent of age-related changes in blood pressure. Thus, aging alters left ventricular diastolic function, with reduced rate and extent of the rapid filling phase related to increased regional diastolic asynchrony.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results may be used as a reference to analyze myocardial blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease. Sonicated meglumine sodium diatrizoate solution (Renografin-76), which contains microbubbles measuring 4.5 +/- 2.8 micrograms in diameter by laser analysis, was used as the echocardiographic contrast agent during elective coronary arterriography in 14 patients without significant coronary artery disease. Patients received intracoronary injections of 1.5 to 2 ml of sonicated Renografin-76 without complications. Perfusion characteristics were studied by visual assessment of the two-dimensional echocardiographic images obtained after individual injections. In patients found to be free of significant coronary artery disease by arteriography, the left coronary system always supplied the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral and posterior regions of the left ventricle at the mid-papillary, cross-sectional level. The right coronary artery system perfused the inferior and inferoseptal regions in 89% of the patients identified with a right dominant system. The anterolateral papillary muscle was perfused from the left coronary system in all cases. The posteromedial papillary muscle was perfused from the left coronary system in 58% of the patients and from the right system in 42% of the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aortic valve area was calculated noninvasively in 30 patients with aortic stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization. Continuous wave Doppler ultrasound was employed to estimate the mean transvalvular pressure gradient. The mean left ventricular outflow tract flow velocity and cross-sectional area were determined from pulsed Doppler and two-dimensional ultrasound recordings. Electrical transthoracic bioimpedance cardiography performed simultaneously with the ultrasonic study and repeated at the time of catheterization measured heart rate, systolic ejection period and cardiac output. These noninvasive data permitted calculation of aortic valve area using the Gorlin equation (range 0.21 to 1.75 cm2) and the continuity equation (range 0.25 to 1.9 cm2). Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed valve area to range from 0.21 to 1.75 cm2. The mean Doppler pressure gradient estimate was highly predictive of the gradient measured at catheterization (r = +0.92, SEE = 10). Bioimpedance cardiac output measurements agreed with the average of Fick and indicator dye estimates (r = +0.90, SEE = 0.52). Valve area estimates utilizing continuous wave Doppler ultrasound and electrical bioimpedance were superior (r = +0.91, SEE = 0.12) to estimates obtained utilizing the continuity equation (r = +0.76, SEE = 0.29) and were more reliable in the detection of patients with severe aortic stenosis (9 of 11 versus 6 of 11). These data show that 1) electrical bioimpedance methods accurately estimate cardiac output in the presence of aortic stenosis; 2) the hybridized bioimpedance-Doppler ultrasound method yields accurate estimates of aortic stenosis area; and 3) the speed, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of aortic stenosis evaluation may be improved by this hybridized approach.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to prospectively determine the incidence of diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation in atrioventricular (AV) block using Doppler echocardiography. The temporal relation between mitral and tricuspid diastolic insufficiency and the diastolic murmur recorded in patients with complete heart block was also investigated. Twenty-two consecutive patients with AV block (referred to the Echo-Doppler laboratory for routine clinical studies), aged 18 to 87 years, were enrolled in the study. Eleven patients had third degree AV block and a ventricular-inhibited (VVI) pacemaker, two patients had second degree AV block, seven patients had first degree AV block, one patient had blocked premature atrial complexes and one patient had atrial flutter with 4:1 AV block. Diastolic mitral regurgitation was detected in 20 patients, and diastolic tricuspid regurgitation in 21. A mid-diastolic murmur was detected in all patients except in the three youngest. The murmur occurred before diastolic regurgitation and coincided with peak forward flow through the AV valve after atrial contraction. M-mode mitral valve echocardiograms obtained in nine patients demonstrated near closure of some portions of the mitral valve after atrial contraction. Effective closure of the valve, however, did not occur unless ventricular systole supervened. In conclusion, diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are almost universally present in patients with AV block and are associated with a diastolic murmur. The murmur coincides with forward AV valve flow. Diastolic regurgitation is silent. Effective AV valve closure is not established until ventricular systole occurs, as demonstrated by M-mode echocardiographic recording of the mitral valve.\r"

  ".W": "Echocardiographic color Doppler flow mapping was performed in 46 normal women to determine the normal flow phenomena across each of the four heart valves. Three groups were studied: Group I consisted of 15 highly trained long distance runners, mean age 27 years, running an average of 105 km/week, with a mean rest heart rate of 45 beats/min; Group II consisted of 14 moderately trained long distance runners, mean age 28, running an average of 60 km/week, with a mean rest heart rate of 53 beats/min; Group III consisted of 17 sedentary control subjects, mean age 28, with a mean rest heart rate of 77 beats/min. Color Doppler flow mapping showed that the ventricular inflow and outflow patterns were the same for each of the groups and identified a regurgitant flow pattern across each of the valves. A tricuspid regurgitant flow pattern was present in 14 subjects (93%) in Group I, 8 (57%) in Group II and 4 (24%) in Group III. A pulmonary regurgitant flow pattern was present in 13 subjects (87%) in Group I, 8 (57%) in Group II and 3 (18%) in Group III. A mitral regurgitant flow pattern was present in 4 subjects (20%) in Group I, 5 (35%) in Group II and 1 (17%) in Group III and an aortic regurgitant flow pattern was present in 1 subject (6%) in Group I. Patients in Group I had significantly more tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitant flow patterns than did patients in Group III (p less than 0.001). Heart rate and distance training in women appear to correlate with the frequency of tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitant flow patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rate-responsive cardiac pacing requires a sensitive physiologic variable that is closely correlated with the heart rate-oxygen uptake relation, particularly in patients with heart failure whose cardiac output response to exercise is more dependent on heart rate. Accordingly, the heart rate response to upright exercise was measured in 81 patients with heart failure or hypertension, or both, and in 27 normal subjects. Oxygen uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), cardiac output, right heart pressures and the mixed venous temperature, oxygen saturation (SvO2) and pH were analyzed throughout exercise. Linear regression analysis of these variables with heart rate revealed the following: 1) There was a highly linear heart rate-VO2 relation in each subject (the average slope of this relation was greater [p less than 0.05] in patients with more severe failure). 2) VE was highly correlated with exercise heart rate, and its slope was not different between normal subjects and patients. 3) Mixed venous temperature and pH were poor predictors of exercise heart rate, particularly at low or moderate levels of work; however, SvO2 was highly correlated with heart rate for all levels of work. Thus, in normal subjects and patients with heart failure or hypertension, or both, heart rate increases linearly with isotonic leg exercise. Minute ventilation and mixed venous oxygen saturation are highly correlated with this response and may serve as potential sensors for rate-responsive pacemakers.\r"

The degree of fracture risk at a specific bone site is best assessed by measuring the density of the bone with single- and dual-photon absorptiometry or with computed tomography. Bone density in women at any adult age is quite variable. Numerous diet and life-style factors are thought to influence bone density and, in turn, fracture risk. Strong evidence exists for a relationship between bone density and amenorrhea, body weight, alcoholism, smoking, and inactivity. In contrast, conflicting or insufficient evidence exists for a relationship with dietary protein, phosphorus, caffeine, and calcium intake. To minimize fracture risk, young women should have regular menses, consume a nutritionally adequate diet, perform regular physical activity, and, probably, use fluoridated water. When immediately postmenopausal, women should seriously consider estrogen replacement, since osteopenia is the rule, rather than the exception, in old age.\r"

Instruments were adopted or adapted to assess the following items: knowledge of the grief process, personality traits of empathy and dogmatism, fear of death, fear of interacting with the dying, attitudes toward working with terminally ill clients as part of the professional role of dietitians, and clinical performance. Scores for the traits of empathy and dogmatism were negatively related, and students with a higher degree of religious conviction had lower death fear scores. Although no significant changes were found in any of the attitude scores after the curriculum unit, most students indicated that the unit made them feel more comfortable about working with the seriously ill. Students and faculty recommended that death education be included for dietetic students.\r"

Role functions receiving the greatest time investments were in the categories of foodservice management and nutrition care. Resident nutrition care issues were often rated as major problems. Dietitians' perceptions of nutrition care problems and inadequacy of time to perform role functions indicate a need to re-evaluate priorities for role performance and to obtain increased service hours. Methods to increase consulting time should include effective marketing of services and involvement in legislative and regulatory processes.\r"

The diet order classification that required the largest amount of the dietitians' time according to selected components of the nutrition care process was the calorie-controlled diabetic diet. Among the four nutrition care levels, dietitians expended the greatest percentages of time providing services for patients requiring intermediate (35.4%) and advanced intermediate care (30.4%). Dietitians expended more time providing client-related activities to patients diagnosed with diseases and disorders of the endocrine and excretory systems than to other patients. Mean times provide the clinical manager with documentation for determining staffing needs and costs of services.\r"

The task force meetings should be structured to maximize efficiency and productivity. The plan of action is developed by the task force members; all decisions are based upon input from the work group. Successful implementation of the solutions is the responsibility of the task force.

Despite this, little empirical data are available concerning the nature of such impairments, their rate of occurrence or their relationship to the disease process. This study investigated 127 patients with a primary diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Two methods of behavioral assessment were employed: a standardized dementia rating scale and a checklist of behavioral problems. Results indicated a) the overall number of problems significantly increased with increased cognitive impairment, b) the types of problems reported varied with cognitive severity, and c) behavioral problems were not significantly associated with patient's age, gender, duration, or age at onset of dementia. These findings are discussed as they relate to the phenomenology of dementia of the Alzheimer's type and to suggestions for interventions at different stages of the disease process. Problems found associated with level of impairment such as wandering, agitation, incontinence, and poor personal hygiene are thought to be characteristic of the disease and therefore predictable. Problems found not associated with level of impairment such as hallucinations, irrational suspicions, falls, and restlessness are likely to be idiosyncratic. The former should probably be incorporated into education and intervention programs; the latter addressed as needed on an individual basis.\r"

One patient was found to be normal after neurological examination, four showed evidence of a single brain lesion, and 15 of 20 (75%) had multiple neurological abnormalities suggesting multifocal brain disease. The mechanism of cognitive deficits in cardiac patients is unclear, and it may be related to multiple infarcts, or acute or chronic hypoxic damage secondary to arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or small vessel disease of the brain. The term \"circulatory dementia\" is proposed to describe patients with vascular disease and non-Alzheimer type dementia. Patients with cardiac disease should undergo cognitive screening, as early identification of patients at risk of progressive intellectual loss may allow early use of preventive therapy.\r"

Neuropsychological tests employed where the color slide test, digit symbol test, digit span test, logical memory test, word fluency test, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. We measured mood using a mood test and geriatric depression scale. Each subject was tested before, and immediately after, control and exercise sessions. Fifteen elderly subjects [ten men and five women; mean age, 66 years, (range, 60 to 85 years)] completed the study. There was a greater improvement in six of the eight scores of cognitive function following exercise, compared to control. These differences were significantly greater following exercise for the logical memory test score (P less than or equal to 0.02) and Mini-Mental State Examination (P less than or equal to 0.025) compared with the control intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Labor and supply costs associated with the care of urinary incontinent patients in three nursing homes were measured. First, normal nursing home changing patterns and their associated costs were measured. Second, the costs were documented when patients were checked by research staff and changed on an hourly basis as needed. Nursing home staff changed patients significantly less frequently than patient voiding as detected by the hourly checking system. Thus, cost of incontinence during the hourly checking condition ($3.35) per 12-hour patient-day was significantly higher than the cost normally incurred in nursing homes ($1.52) per 12-hour patient-day. The cost of an incontinence rehabilitation program, which significantly reduced incontinence episodes, was contrasted to the cost of incontinence as measured under both of the previous conditions. The rehabilitation program produced significant labor and supply savings only when compared with the hourly checking and changing system. Maintaining patients in a more continent condition costs significantly more than the direct incontinence cost normally incurred by the nursing home. Quality of life and other second-order benefits must be considered if continence rehabilitation is to be judged cost-effective.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine if a bladder-relaxant drug could enhance the effectiveness of a toileting program for incontinence among functionally impaired nursing home patients, 15 patients with detrusor hyperreflexia were enrolled in a 6-week trial during which they were put on a habit training protocol alone for 2 weeks, habit training (HT) and a placebo for 2 weeks, and then HT and oxybutynin for 2 weeks (2.5 mg three times daily for 1 week, then 5 mg three times daily for 1 week). Bacteriuria, which was present without other symptoms in 11 of the 13 patients who completed the trial, was treated before HT began. Eradication of the bacteriuria resulted in a small, statistically significant increase in cystometric bladder capacity (44 mL; 95% confidence interval 16 to 72 mL), but the detrusor hyperreflexia and frequent episodes of incontinence persisted. HT alone reduced the mean percentage of every-two-hour checks which were wet from 43% to 32% (95% confidence interval of the difference -1% to -21%; P = .04 by a paired t test); addition of placebo and active drug did not result in any further reduction. Cystometric bladder capacity had not changed significantly by the end of the trial (measured while patients were still on active drug), and there was no consistent relationship between changes in bladder capacity and changes in wet checks. Although our sample size is small, the data are consistent with other studies in similar populations. The relatively practical and inexpensive interventions we employed in this study will need to be modified or intensified in order to substantially reduce the frequency of incontinence among functionally disabled nursing home patients.\r"

Over a 7-year period, a medical group cared for 110 patients in a skilled nursing facility. After assessing the patients' wishes and the opinions of the personal physicians and nurses, care plans were made specifying whether each one was to receive maximum, intermediate, or comfort care. The hospitalization rate was found to be 79% lower for the patients receiving comfort care. Multiple admissions were unusual. Those patients made no use of outpatient consultants or major diagnostic procedures and had only 14% as many roentgenograms as the patients receiving maximum care. Whereas acute medical and surgical problems and related physician visits were more frequent for the comfort care groups, specific treatment of those problems was withheld far more often. Mortality was twice as great among the comfort care patients, and nearly all of these deaths occurred in the nursing home. It was concluded that the patient's decision to avoid active management can be honored by specific patient plans carefully communicated to all physicians sharing responsibility for that person's care.\r"

  ".W": "With aging, there are changes in both libido and erectile function. Although the majority of aged men remain interested in sex, less than 15% report continued sexual intercourse. The cause of this \"libido-potency gap\" is due primarily to erectile failure. Penile erection is dependent upon a complex interaction of the autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular system, and local neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Sexual stimulation causes augmented blood flow into the corpora cavernosa, and restricted outflow, resulting in penile rigidity. With aging, there is a decline in gonadal steroids, nerve conduction velocity, and vascular compliance, any of which could interfere with normal erections. When disease is superimposed on the normal changes of aging, erectile function is further impaired. Evaluation of an elderly male with impotence may consist of a detailed drug history and trial of alternate therapy, as in the case of adverse drug reactions. More often, evaluation entails hormonal assays, penile vascular assessment, neurologic assessment, and an evaluation of nocturnal erectile function. Based on the results of these assessments, appropriate treatment alternatives can be chosen. With the availability of multiple treatment options, patients and physicians can now choose from a range of noninvasive or invasive alternatives depending upon the etiology, associated disorders, and preference of the patient.\r"

GEE (kcal/min) was estimated using the caloric equivalent for each liter of oxygen consumed at the measured respiratory exchange ratio during submaximal exercise. The men performed a 10-min submaximal cycle ergometer exercise test at a power output (PO) of 100 W. Pedalling frequency was 50 rpm. Results showed a significant 5.9% decrease in GEE (p less than .01) from 8.5 +/- 0.8 (M +/- SD) kcal/min in 1969 to 8.0 +/- 0.4 (M +/- SD) Kcal/min in 1985. In addition, the effects of chronological age and leisure time physical activity on GEE were assessed and found to be nonsignificant, although a significant decrease in GEE over time (p less than .02) was observed in both groups. The present results support a decrease in GEE in middle-aged and older men over the 16-year time period. Furthermore, this decrease in GEE persisted regardless of chronological age or leisure time physical activity status.\r"

Specimens came from male and female cadavers representing three age groups: young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults. The results show a range of more than 100-fold in taste bud density that is evenly distributed among age groups and sexes. The disparity is not attributable to the state of health of the adults prior to death, and it is corroborated in the literature. Differences in taste bud density that extend across age groups probably confound some inferences about the effects of aging on taste sensitivity that are derived from cross-sectional studies of human populations. It is not clear from the data whether or not human taste bud density in individuals and in populations is stable or changing with time.\r"

The progression of chronic nephropathy was markedly retarded by replacing casein with soy protein. Only 7% of the rats dying spontaneously on the soy protein-containing diet exhibited end-stage chronic nephropathy compared to 41% of the rats on the casein-containing diet.

Physiological measurements included sweat responses, esophageal and skin temperatures, nonevaporative heat exchange, heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and metabolic heat production. There was no significant difference in sweat rate or in onset of sweating between the older and younger men; however, esophageal temperature at the onset of sweating was greater in the older men. Changes in skin temperature, nonevaporative heat exchange, metabolic heat production, heart rate, and cardiac output were the same during heat exposure in both age groups. However, forearm blood flow before and after exposure to heat was significantly lower in the elderly group. These data suggest that the greater health risk posed to resting, yet healthy, aged men by hot environments is not a consequence of inadequate sweating but could be associated with retardation of the vasodilation reflex, which can prevent effective transfer of the body heat to its shell, thus resulting in greater heat storage.\r"

This small decline occurs entirely within the range of normal, contrary to many previous reports. Mean albumin values were 4.25 (+/- .26 SD) for subjects in the eighth decade and 4.13 (+/- .29 SD) in the ninth decade. Longitudinally, there was an upwards trend in albumin for five birth cohorts over an 8-yr period which may reflect laboratory drift. A multivariate model of cross-sectional data can explain only 5% of the variance. The age-related decline within healthy subjects is far less than previously described. Our data demonstrate that hypoalbuminemia is not a consequence of normal aging.\r"

Heart rates and blood pressures were examined also. When supine, average heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and HRV for the young volunteers were 66.5 bpm, 113.0/64.3 mmHg, and 5.74 log units of relative power, respectively. The same values for the elderly group were 65.4 bpm, 126.3/74.0 mmHg, and 4.43 log units. Statistical analysis revealed that, compared to the young volunteers, supine elderly volunteers had similar heart rates, higher blood pressures, and lower baroreceptor HRV. There was little change in blood pressure in either group upon standing. However, upon standing, heart rate increased 17.7 bpm and baroreceptor HRV increased to 6.58 (+ 14.6%) in the younger volunteers. This was significantly different from the elderly volunteers, whose heart rate increased by only 10.9 bpm and their HRV to 4.72 (+ 6.5%). These results indicate that much of the reduction in HRV in old age results from decreases in baroreceptor modulation of heart rate. In addition, the difference between young and old persons is greatest in the standing position because elderly individuals exhibit less recruitment of baroreceptor activity with postural change.\r"

  ".W": "Two cross-sectional studies explored the relationship between age and individuals' desire for control both on a general day-to-day level and as patients in health care situations. The relationship between age and expectancies for control over health also was examined. In Study 1, questionnaire surveys completed by 246 community adults ranging in age from 19 to 77 indicated that for health-specific measures at older ages, belief in internal control and desire for control are lower, and belief in control by powerful others is higher. In contrast, no significant differences in general desires for control were found across age groups. In Study 2, expectancies and desire for control in relation to the health of 350 patients about to undergo barium enemas, chemotherapy, or surgery were measured. Older adults reported a lower desire for control of their health care and a greater belief in the ability of powerful others to control their health than did younger adults. The replication of these age differences across samples differing in several respects, including education and health status, suggests that this is a highly reliable finding.\r"

Based on their reason for discontinuation, participants who were lost to the panel were categorized into three attrition groups: deceased, ill, and voluntary dropouts. When the performance of these groups prior to leaving the study was compared with that of the continuing participants, no general differences were found. However, specific differences were revealed, particularly on crystallized-type intellectual abilities and the personality factors. Participants who were lost due to illness or death had functioned at the lowest levels of the four groups prior to attrition. These effects varied by age. In late middle age, ill participants functioned at the lowest levels, whereas in old age, participants who subsequently died scored lowest of the four groups prior to attrition. Individuals who had voluntarily discontinued participation in the study most closely resembled the continuing participants, particularly in late middle age. The results indicate that performance effects associated with continued participation vary by age, the intelligence or personality factor being considered, and the reason for loss of the participant. Furthermore, they suggest that loss of participants from a longitudinal panel does not inevitably bias the validity of developmental findings.\r"

In addition to an overall increase in performance latency, the elderly group exhibited a linear increase in response initiation (RT) with increases in task complexity similar to that of the young group. However, the elderly participants showed a proportional increase over the young participants in response execution latency (MT). Further, the elderly group had a slower RT for short movements than long movements, an effect not found in the young group. Compared with the young participants, the elderly participants showed greater asynchrony in response initiation of bimanual movements; increased inability to subsequently compensate during response execution also resulted in a greater asynchrony in response termination. These results suggest specific aging deficits in bimanual coordination processes.\r"

The scale has high internal consistency reliability, discriminates strongly between patients and nonpatients, and relates in the expected fashion to theoretically relevant variables. There is some evidence that scores are influenced by socially desirable responding (SDR) and that these effects should be considered when examining the correlates of the CES-D in this population. Scale scores do not differ by interviewer. Overall, the CES-D appears to be a useful measure for studying within-group variability in depressive mood among older Puerto Ricans.\r"

Under conditions in which visually distinctive cues were added to the spatial context (a colored map, a three-dimensional unpainted model, a three-dimensional painted model, or a large room), no difference in performance between young and elderly respondents was observed.

Analysis of covariance structures, or LISREL, was used to assess the factorial invariance. Differences in the factorial structure of the LSI were found between the older generation and the other two generations (i.e., the middle-age and younger generations). These differences persisted even when generational differences in education, income, and acculturation were taken into account. Further analyses revealed that generational differences were contained in only one (i.e., congruence) of the three first- comparisons in the other two dimensions (i.e., zest and mood tone) are appropriate.\r"

The Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used for the analysis of survival data that includes censored data. We calculated hazard indices for residents with different characteristics to show the independent effect of these variables on the probability of nursing home entry. Seven variables emerged as statistically significant covariates: sex, marital status, roommate status, entry year into the community, entry age into the community, number of hospitalizations, and community of residence. The community of residence, which in large part reflects system effects on nursing home entry, was found to be the single most important variable explaining variance in the data. Tobit analysis was used to examine the factors associated with multiple nursing home entries and total days per year spent in a nursing home. With a few exceptions, most of the variables listed above were also significant correlates of multiple entries and total days per year spent in a nursing home.\r"

It would have fallen further if women had not changed the types of households in which they lived, but by only an additional 3 percentage points. The effect of changes in household composition, however, was greatest for the oldest of the elderly individuals.\r"

Multiple-regression analysis revealed that community size is the strongest predictor of overall service awareness. However, variation in the awareness of individual services found for elderly residents of different community sizes suggests that the role this variable plays in service awareness is not as straightforward as is often assumed.\r"

For parents aged 74 and younger, proximity values, reciprocity in help exchanges, number of children helping relatives other than the participant, and number of children working outside of the home predicted satisfaction; for parents aged 75 and older, self-reported general health and kin-orientation values predicted satisfaction. It is concluded that values regarding families, interdependence, and autonomy provide a critical context for reactions to help by adult children.\r"

Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that Qa-2 glycoproteins from both of these sources have a relative molecular mass of approximately 37 kDa. After treatment with endoglycosidase F, the Qa-2 polypeptide chains derived from C57BL/10 spleen and Q7b-transfected R1.1 cells displayed identical mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis because of removal of N-linked oligosaccharide residues. Furthermore, treatment of Qa-2 proteins from both sources with cyanogen bromide or alpha-chymotrypsin resulted in identical peptide fragmentation patterns. These results therefore provide a biochemical correlation between a cloned Qa-region gene produce expressed on the surface of transfected cells, and the Qa-2 glycoprotein on spleen cells that was described a decade ago by serologic methods.\r"

One anti-Id (IgG,K) recognized a private idiotope, TID 3.2, present only on the IgA,K immunogen, close to or within the antigen-combining site. The other anti-Id (IgM,K) recognized a recurrent idiotope, TID 7.1, outside the paratope and present in normal human and BALB/c mouse serum, on 2 of 11 polyspecific human monoclonal immunoglobulins and on 6 of 11 murine natural monoclonal auto-antibodies exhibiting a widespread anticytoskeletal protein-binding activity. Both the idiotopes were absent on two induced anti-tubulin antibodies exhibiting a monospecific anti-alpha- and anti-beta-tubulin specificity. Utilizing competitive and additivity immunoassays, we could show that the polyspecific human and mouse anticytoskeletal antibodies tested, whether bearing the TID 7.1 Id or not, appeared to compete in variable degrees for epitopes on the tubulin molecule recognized by the monoclonal IgA,K but distinct from the epitopes recognized by the induced monospecific anti-tubulin antibodies. The high incidence of the recurrent TID 7.1 idiotope in man and mouse suggests an important physiologic and perhaps regulatory function of this idiotope. Furthermore our data suggest that a restricted family of germ-line genes, highly conserved during phylogeny, may encode for these idiotope-bearing Ig molecules.\r"

Phorbol dibutyrate was less potent than PMA in stimulating diradylglycerol accumulation, whereas the 4-alpha analogs of PMA and phorbol dibutyrate were inactive. Submaximal concentrations of PMA (0.5 to 2.5 nM) plus the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (15 to 60 nM), led to synergistic accumulation of diradylglycerols. Chlorpromazine and sphingosine, inhibitors of protein kinase C, blocked PMA-stimulated accumulation of diradylglycerol with IC50 concentrations of 32 and 9 microM, respectively, paralleling their inhibition of PMA-stimulated O2- production. These compounds also inhibited the ionomycin-stimulated accumulation of diradylglycerols. A third protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7, was less effective, inhibiting PMA-stimulated accumulation of diradylglycerol by 25% at 100 microM. Differential sensitivity to alkaline hydrolysis suggests that diradylglycerols that accumulate in response to PMA or ionomycin stimulation are composed of a mixture of two distinct diglyceride species, diacylglycerols and alkylacylglycerols. Whereas diacylglycerol may activate cellular protein kinase C, the importance of the production of alkylacylglycerols is uncertain.\r"

In other experiments in which PMNL were washed after exposure to Fab of KuFc79, phagocytosis of IgG-sensitized sheep erythrocytes was inhibited by 36%. Fab fragments of other mouse IgG2b monoclonal proteins did not have these effects. When PMNL are exposed to coverslips coated with univalent Fab fragments of this antibody, the Fc gamma R are removed from the surface of the PMNL. Under these conditions, rosetting could be inhibited by 85.4%. We examined cross-linking of receptor bound monoclonal antibody or its Fab fragment by either Protein A or F(ab')2 of an anti-mouse Ig. As much as 31.7% of beta-glucuronidase, a marker for lysosomal enzymes, is specifically released by cross-linking the Fc gamma R on PMNL. The generation of O2- is also induced by specifically cross-linking Fc gamma R with Fab and anti-Fab. The data constitute the first formal demonstration that cross-linking of Fc gamma R on PMNL leads to enzyme release and superoxide generation.\r"

Apparent saturation was reached in approximately 35 min with 34 ng of mAb-11G1 binding to 5 X 10(7) spirochetes giving an estimated 4.8 X 10(2) IgM molecules per spirochete and thus a minimum of 480 binding sites per organism. Enzymatic digestion studies suggest that the antigenic determinant to mAb-11G1 is contained within the peptide chain of OSP-A as binding could be eliminated by treatment of the spirochetes with proteinase K, Pronase and pepsin (100 to 200 micrograms/ml of enzyme) but not by trypsin or bromelain treatment. Periodate oxidation as well as mixed and endoglycosidase treatment of the spirochetes did not alter the binding of mAb-11G1. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of whole spirochetal cell lysates disclosed that OSP-A is a heterogeneously charged basic protein with an apparent isoelectric point range from 8.5 to 9.0. Amino acid analysis of OSP-A showed a 10% lysine component which could provide the basic nature to the protein. OSP-A with the intact antigenic determinant for mAb-11G1 can be found in the urine of hamsters experimentally infected with B. burgdorferi.\r"

  ".U": "88088821\r", 
  ".W": "The question of linkage of virulence traits to variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression in African trypanosomiasis was addressed. Previously we demonstrated that daughter cells arising in mice infected with a genetically homogeneous trypanosome population of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense were more virulent than the infecting population (J. A. Inverso and J. M. Mansfield, J. Immunol. 130:412, 1983). These virulent trypanosomes expressed differences in surface phenotype compared with the infecting variant types, and we proposed that virulence may be \"linked\" to VSG expression. In the present study, however, we have shown that expression of virulence is independent of the VSG phenotype displayed by trypanosome populations. A VSG-identical but highly virulent subpopulation of T. b. rhodesiense LouTat 1 was derived by rapid subpassage and subcloning in immunosuppressed mice. The virulent LouTat 1A subclone derived in this manner killed B10.BR/SgSnJ mice in 3 to 4 days postinfection compared with approximately 60 days for the parent clone, LouTat 1. The virulent subclone LouTat 1A appears to express the same VSG as the less virulent LouTat 1 population, as determined by polyspecific and monoclonal antibody-binding assays, cross-protection tests, and amino acid sequence analyses of the N-terminal portion of the VSG molecules. When LouTat 1 and subclone LouTat 1A were injected into a heterologous host species, multiple variant antigenic types (VATs) arising from each inoculum were isolated and characterized. VATs derived from the virulent subclone were as uniformly virulent for B10.BR mice as LouTat 1A. In summary, these results demonstrate that trypanosome virulence, once expressed, is a stable phenotype that does not seem to be associated with a particular VSG phenotype, nor does virulence change with the expression of different VSG genes.\r"

The electrophoretically homogeneous preparation, with m.w. 15,000, was tested with a panel of antibodies that confirmed the presence of the LY-6C.2 epitope. An N-terminal sequence of 39 amino acids was obtained showing 59% homology with the corresponding portion of the Ly-6A.2 polypeptide. Based on the least homologous (29%) 14 amino acid segment, an oligonucleotide probe was constructed, and Ly-6C.2 cDNA was cloned from a BW5147 cDNA library. A 794-base pair cDNA containing the entire coding region had 82% homology with Ly-6A.2 cDNA. The encoded polypeptide sequence of 131 amino acids containing a perfect correlation with the N-terminal sequence data was 63% homologous with that of Ly-6A.2. The greatest homology was in the leader, first 16 N-terminal and last 39 C-terminal amino acids. The latter are likely to be important in determining the attachment of glycophosphatidylinositol. Despite results indicating fewer disulfide constraints in the Ly-6C molecule, the predicted sequence contains 10 cysteine residues nearly perfectly matched with those predicted in Ly-6A.\r"

  ".W": "Although the polymorphic human Ia epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 109d6 typically is expressed by DRw53 beta 2 chains, the epitope was shown to be encoded by distinctive DR beta 1 chains of a DRw10 haplotype in three unrelated DR4-negative individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. No evidence of a DR beta 2 (DR beta 4) chain molecule was found to be encoded by this haplotype. Using two-dimensional gel analysis and partial radioactive N-terminal microsequencing, the DR and DQ products were characterized in the heterozygous members of a family in which the segregation of both varieties of DR beta chains specifying the 109d6 epitope was demonstrated. The expression of the epitope on the DR beta 2 chain, but not on the DR beta 1 chain, was abolished by preventing N-linked glycosylation, although in both molecules the epitope was not altered by neuraminidase digestion. The potential structural bases of the serologic cross reactions of DRw10 are discussed, as are the possible implications of the findings for the definition of susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

The results clearly establish that the mouse macrophage Fc gamma R contains two intrachain disulfide bonds, each of which connects adjacent cysteine residues within the two putative extracellular domains of the molecule. In addition, each disulfide-bonded domain was shown to contain two authentic sites of N-linked glycosylation. Extensive peptide sequencing resulted in the unexpected identification of peptide fragments from a fourth Fc gamma R whose sequences were highly homologous to sequences surrounding the two Cys residues in the amino-terminal domain of both alpha and beta 1 Fc gamma R. The fourth Fc gamma R contains a disulfide-bonded amino-terminal domain similar to beta 1 Fc gamma R.\r"

Hybrid hybridomas made from IgA lambda 2 anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) and IgA kappa anti-phosphocholine (PC) parental cells secreted polymeric IgA antibodies that bound both TNP and PC. Some of the TNP binding was dissociated from the PC binding under conditions of mild reduction and alkylation suggesting that the bispecific polymeric IgA contained disulfide-linked parental monomers as well as bispecific hybrid monomers. Hybrid hybridomas constructed from IgA lambda 2 anti-TNP and IgM kappa anti-ox erythrocyte parental cells secreted bispecific, polymeric immunoglobulin that contained mu-, alpha-, kappa-, and lambda 2-chains. The mu and kappa-chains dissociated from the alpha- and lambda 2-chains under conditions of mild reduction and alkylation, indicating that both parental monomers had been incorporated into the same polymeric immunoglobulin to form a heteropolymeric antibody molecule. Heterologous pairing of alpha and mu heavy chains in monomers was not detected. Hybrid hybridomas constructed from IgA lambda 2 and IgG3 lambda 2 or IgA lambda 2 and IgG1 kappa parents co-secreted both parental immunoglobulins, but the antibodies secreted by these clones did not form heteropolymers or exhibit heterologous heavy chain pairing. These findings establish that polyvalent, bispecific, polymeric immunoglobulin molecules can be produced by hybrid hybridomas when both parents express a naturally polymerizing class of heavy chain but not when only one parent does. Hybrid hybridomas that produce heteropolymeric immunoglobulins are sources of high avidity bispecific antibodies that may find a number of basic and practical applications. The hybridoma cells that produce these antibodies may provide useful tools for investigating the in situ determinants of immunoglobulin chain association and the regulation of antibody assembly and secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Immunologic activation of purified human lung mast cells (HLMC) and basophils with anti-IgE induced histamine release but failed to elicit any changes in cAMP levels. In contrast, histamine release and monophasic rises in cAMP were observed in both rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) challenged with concanavalin A (73% enhancement over basal cAMP 20 sec after activation) and a cultured mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell (PT18 cell line) passively sensitized with dinitrophenol-specific IgE and stimulated with antigen (39% increase above basal at 15 sec). The adenylate cyclase activators isoprenaline, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and forskolin and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) all induced elevations in cAMP levels in both basophils and HLMC. In basophils, PGE2 and isoprenaline produced approximately twofold increases in cAMP that were maximal at 1 min and decayed thereafter. Forskolin and IBMX produced threefold increases in cAMP that peaked 10 min after activation and persisted for up to 20 min. In HLMC, isoprenaline provoked a rapid monophasic fourfold increase in cAMP that was maximal at 1 min after addition. Levels of cAMP subsequently declined but remained significantly elevated over resting levels for up to 30 min. PGE2, forskolin, and IBMX all produced approximately threefold rises in HLMC cAMP that peaked around 5 min and persisted for 30 min. In both the basophil and HLMC, agonist-induced elevations in cAMP correlated well with the inhibition of mediator release. In basophils, the order IBMX greater than forskolin greater than PGE2 greater than isoprenaline held for both the inhibition of histamine and leukotriene C4 release and the augmentation of cAMP levels. In HLMC, individual agonists elevated cAMP levels to similar degrees and inhibited the release of histamine, leukotriene C4, and PGD2 to comparable extents, although the release of the arachidonate metabolites was generally more sensitive to the inhibitory actions of these agonists. These results suggest that elevations in cAMP, in both the basophil and HLMC, are associated with the inhibition of mediator release but not the initiation of the secretory process.\r"

Concanavalin A-stimulated or control lymphocytes were allowed to locomote into slabs of type I collagen gel. The assay configuration permitted extraction of both total populations and locomotory subpopulations as viable, single-cell suspensions suitable for phenotypic and cell analysis. Concanavalin A stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the mean distance traveled by the leading cell front in 4 hr, from 23 microns (controls) to 67 microns. The estimated percentage of motile cells increased from 0.9 to 2.8%. Similar increases were observed after 18 hr of locomotion. The SIg+, Thy-1+, L3T4+, and Ly-2+ subsets exhibited equivalent increases in motility. Total populations and locomotory subpopulations were allowed to incorporate 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and their cell cycle profiles were compared by dual parameter anti-5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, propidium iodide fluorescence analysis. Total population and locomotory subpopulations did not differ significantly with respect to the ratio G0/G1:S, indicating that lymphocytes in these two phases exhibited approximately equal motility. Cells in late S and G2 + M were significantly less motile; locomotory subpopulations contained 60 to 75% fewer G2 + M cells than the total populations from which they were derived. Taken together, the results indicate that the concanavalin A-induced increase in motility commences before S phase and that motility diminishes shortly before or during G2 + M.\r"

We found that resistance to macrophage killing may be transmitted by an infectious AKR or AKR-like murine leukemia virus and that resistance was concomitant with virus expression as measured by the presence of AKR virus-specific 70 kDa glycoprotein. We report that macrophage cytotoxicity of these cell lines is dependent upon the direct contact between tumor cells and macrophages. In contrast, macrophage-mediated cytostasis occurred via soluble macrophage products and no differential susceptibility of F5b or F5m to macrophage-mediated cytostasis was observed. Macrophage binding of F5b was also significantly better than that of F5m. These data suggest that only the events that depend upon the close contact of macrophages and tumor cells will be affected by the expression of AKR or AKR-like virus. Therefore, the differences in susceptibility of F5m and F5b to direct macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity are apparently because the macrophage binding of F5m is less efficient than the binding of F5b.\r"

These sites were identified by assaying binding of polyclonal BALB/c mouse antipeptide sera to the complete set of all possible di-, tri, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octapeptides homologous with the 24-residue sequence. Individual epitopes were defined and essential residues identified by testing the binding of monoclonal antibodies to sets of peptide analogues in which every one of the homologous residues was replaced in turn by each of the 19 alternative genetically coded amino acids. The immunodominant epitope was shown to be a linear sequence of five amino acids, 314LKLAT318. Replacement of any one of these residues with any other amino acid resulted in loss of antibody binding, indicating that all five are essential to the interaction and that they are probably contact residues. Another antigenic site contains at least two overlapping epitopes: polyclonal sera recognize predominantly an epitope or epitopes encompassed by the linear sequence 320MRNVPEKQT328, whereas the epitope defined by a particular monoclonal antibody comprises the seven amino acids 322NVPEKQT328, of which N322, E325, and Q327 were implicated as contact residues.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of mice with 20 micrograms polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) after exposure to camphor odor results in a conditioned augmentation of natural killer cell (NK) activity. In this study, we show that the conditioned response is not the result of nociceptive stimulation and that interferon-beta (IFN), but not IFN-alpha can replace Poly I:C as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Two conditioned stimuli (CS) were used with equivalent results. A combination CS consisting of a novel taste (saccharin) and a 125 mg/kg injection of LiCl that induces gastric upset was paired with a Poly I:C or IFN-beta (1 X 10(4) IU) injection. This resulted in an augmentation of NK activity when the conditioned animals were reexposed to the saccharin-LiCl CS. In addition, an identical conditioned response was elicited when a camphor odor CS was paired with either of these US. To test whether the conditioned response might be an artifact not detected by our controls, a mock conditioning experiment was performed, which assessed the differential effect of multiple exposures to the saccharin-LiCl CS without a CS/US pairing. The mock conditioned group was significantly suppressed relative to saline treated controls, whereas the mock nonconditioned group and the mock conditioned group that was not reexposed to the CS after conditioning did not show significant suppression. This indicates that the augmentation observed in the conditioned group after CS/US pairing was not the result of exposure to the CS itself. Small doses of Poly I:C (5 micrograms or 2.5 micrograms) given on days 3 and 5 (or on day 5 only) to boost NK activity had the effect of increasing the magnitude of the conditioned response measured on day 6. In addition, an identical conditioned response was observed when the interval between the CS/US pairing and the later CS exposures was changed, which places the test for the conditioned response either on day 6 (CS given on days 3 and 5) or day 10 (CS given on days 7 and 9). These results show that the observed conditioned enhancement of NK activity in conditioned animals is not caused by any nociceptive properties of the CS itself and is dependent on the IFN-beta produced after Poly I:C injection in the conditioned paradigm.\r"

Cells from the metastatic murine melanoma K1735 and clones of K1735 differing in metastatic potential were exposed to UV radiation in vitro, cloned, and tested for antigenic properties in vivo. Approximately half of the clones isolated after UV irradiation of parental K1735 melanoma cells were highly antigenic (five of nine). Similar treatment of cells of a nonmetastatic clone of K1735 generated clones that were all antigenic (nine of nine). In contrast, only one of nine clones derived from UV-irradiated cells of a highly metastatic clone of K1735 were antigenic. Clones derived from unirradiated cultures were not antigenic variants. The increased antigenicity of cells derived from UV-irradiated cultures did not correlate with an increase in expression of cell surface class I major histocompatibility complex antigens. These results demonstrate that the frequency of antigenic variant production after UV irradiation is an intrinsic property of the particular cell line used, and that even cloned cell lines derived from a single tumor differ in their ability to generate antigenic variants after UV irradiation. In addition, they indicate that the increased antigenicity is not necessarily due to a UV-induced increase in expression of cell surface class I histocompatibility antigens.\r"

  ".W": "H-2-deficient variants, selected from the murine lymphoma RBL-5, were recently shown to be less tumorigenic in syngeneic mice compared with the corresponding H-2-positive wild-type cell line. The present study focused on the detailed cellular interactions leading to the specific rejection of H-2-deficient cells in vivo. In vivo experiments with mixed tumor inocula, measuring either tumor outgrowth or rapid elimination, showed that the presence of H-2-positive lymphoma cells did not suppress the rejection of H-2-deficient cells. Conversely, H-2-deficient cells did not activate a rejection of H-2-positive cells. H-2-deficient cells were selectively eliminated even when they were present in a 10-fold excess compared with the H-2-positive lymphoma cells in the same inoculum. In vitro, H-2-deficient cells were more sensitive to killing by spleen cells from mice treated with interferon or natural killer-inducing agents. The presence of cold H-2-deficient cells did not activate the killing of H-2-positive cells, and H-2-positive cells did not inhibit killing of H-2-deficient cells. Such mixing experiments revealed a more efficient cold target inhibition by the H-2-deficient cells, although no difference was seen between these and the H-2-positive wild-type cells in target binding assays. When Thy-1.2+, nylon wool adherent or phagocytic populations were removed from normal spleen effectors, the difference in spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity between the H-2-deficient and the H-2-positive cells persisted. This result was also obtained when spleen cell effectors from nude mice or asialo GM1+ effectors, positively enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, were used. The results show that the selectivity in the rejection of H-2-deficient cells was not determined in the afferent arm alone. The present data fit with a previously proposed model where natural killer cells would bind equally well to both major histocompatibility complex class I negative and class I positive target cells, but only the latter would be able to present a postbinding inhibitory signal allowing them to escape killing which results in outgrowth in vivo and poor cold target competition in vitro.\r"

Here we report that human epidermis also contains a second, quite distinct enzyme of the phospholipase A2 group, which is unique in its extreme activity against phospholipids in true solution. It also differs from the classic cutaneous enzyme in that (a) its activity is not reduced by pretreatment of the skin with corticosteroids in vivo nor by treatment of the epidermal homogenate with alkaline phosphatase in vitro, and (b) its activity is reduced, rather than increased, in the lesions of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. The enzyme seems to occur mainly in fully differentiated keratinocytes, its level being low in the basal cell layer of epidermis and in keratinocytes cultured in vitro. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that this new phospholipase A2 is responsible for the degradation of phospholipids that accompanies the terminal keratinization process.\r"

  ".W": "Two forms of Ca++-dependent cysteine proteinases, calpain I, requiring low Ca++ (microM concentration), and calpain II, requiring high Ca++ (mM concentration), were purified from the cytosolic fraction of pig epidermis. Calpains I and II were separated on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and thereafter they were purified by separate but almost identical procedures, which included chromatographies on Sephacryl S-300, Blue Sepharose CL-6B, and DEAE Bio-Gel A. Purified calpains I and II required 10 and 450 microM Ca++ for half-maximal activation, respectively, and had an optimal pH of 7.0 to 8.0. Both enzymes were heterodimers and composed of one heavy subunit (83 kDa for calpain I and 80 kDa for calpain II) and one light subunit (29 kDa for both enzymes). The action of calpains I and II on keratin extracted from the same tissue was studied. Both enzymes rapidly cleaved keratin into small fragments. The cleavage depends on Ca++ and could be blocked by leupeptin and calpastation, an endogenous calpain-specific inhibitor, which was also found in the cytosolic fraction of pig epidermis and partially purified.\r"

Little information is available about the nature of superoxide dismutase in mammalian skin. We report the isolation and characterization of superoxide dismutase from human, guinea pig, and mouse epidermis. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase was detected in all the mammalian skin specimens examined. Manganese superoxide dismutase was detected in human and guinea pig epidermis but not in the newborn or adult albino CD1 mouse epidermis. Electrophoresis studies of the extracted and partially purified skin superoxide dismutase on polyacrylamide gel slabs in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate showed the characteristic molecular weights for subunits of 16,500 for copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, and 23,500 for mangano superoxide dismutase. Studies under nondenaturing conditions revealed significant differences in the mobility of the enzymes, depending on the sources of superoxide dismutase. The mouse epidermal copper-zinc superoxide dismutase was found similar to the bovine liver copper-zinc superoxide dismutase used as an internal standard. The copper-zinc superoxide dismutase of human skin and guinea pig skin showed activity-stained bands characterized by a higher mobility than the same enzyme from mouse or bovine liver. Quantitative data using the beta-NADH oxidation method indicated a 5-10-fold lower content of superoxide dismutase in mammalian epidermis in comparison with other tissues examined during this study, or compared with reported values in the literature.\r"

It is now recognized that most cells of the germinative population are in a resting (G0) state, and \"postinjury cell renewal\" is the consequence of G0 cells entering the mitotic cycle. The biochemical events triggering this process, however, are unknown. Here we show that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is able to induce G0 mobilization in the epidermis of the nude mouse. Further, we demonstrate that amiloride (an inhibitor of the membrane Na+-H+ pump), applied topically to human skin, abolishes almost completely the regenerative response after experimental injury. We suggest that activation of the phosphoinositol cycle may initiate recruitment of G0 cells in the epidermis.\r"

The nature of these fibrils is unknown. Skin biopsies were obtained from involved areas of nine patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), one case of generalized morphea, one case of morphea, and six normal controls. Intact skin was analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM), while extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western immunoblotting, radioimmunoassay (RIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fine fibrils 20-40 nm in diameter in the mid to lower dermis of scleroderma skin were labeled with antibodies directed against the aminopropeptide (AP) of type III procollagen. Antibodies directed against the AP of type I procollagen labelled fine fibrils in the lower dermis. Larger fibrils (80-120 nm) did not label. pN alpha 1 (III) was found to be present in both normal and scleroderma skin. Extracts of scleroderma skin contained 2.5 times the amount of pN (III) collagen and 3.0 times the amount of fibronectin as did extracts of normal skin. The data indicate that the increase in thin fibrils in scleroderma skin is most likely due to an increase in type III collagen, which retains the AP at its surface.\r"

Twenty-three healthy volunteers received oral carotenoids (150 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Serum levels were quantitated, and ranged from 390 to 1710 micrograms/dl. Before and after carotenoid administration, the UVA- and UVB-MEDs and the PUVA-MPD were determined by standard phototesting. DNA damage was assessed by autoradiographical measurement of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) following UVB exposure before and after treatment. No statistically significant carotenoid-dependent protection was found against UVA, UVB, and PUVA erythema by comparing the pre- and postcarotenoid erythema doses. Also at the DNA level there was no indication of a protective effect that could be detected with the methods employed: the amount of UVB-induced UDS was not decreased after carotenoid treatment. We conclude that (1) carotenoids do not reduce UVB-, UVA-, or PUVA-induced erythema in human skin; that (2) reactive oxygen species may not be involved in PUVA-erythema production or, alternatively, carotenoids may not quench these radicals sufficiently in vivo; and that (3) carotenoid protection against UVB-induced carcinogenesis does not operate by reducing the number of mutagenic lesions in DNA.\r"

  ".W": "The dorsal and sinus hair follicles from 7-day-old mice of several strains were ultrastructurally examined to study their cell differentiation. The findings were compared with those in human anagen hair follicles. The keratinized cells in the Henle's and Huxley's layers gradually lost their cell volume and finally became thin and lamellar in mice. The outer root sheath (ORS) was composed of two cell layers in the mouse hair bulb. The cells in the outer layer gradually increased in number upwards; the completed outer layer consisted of 2-3, and over 10 cell layers in the mouse dorsal and sinus hair follicles, respectively. These cells produced many membrane-limited, highly electron-dense granules or cementsomes, and finally underwent a keratinization toward the hair canal. The innermost cell (IMC) layer of the ORS formed a unique single-cell layer in mice as well as in humans, although the mouse IMC were much thinner and contained fewer tonofilaments. Accumulation of tonofilaments in the inner side of the cytoplasm and keratohyalin production, but no cementsome production occurred in the mouse IMC. The mouse IMC started to keratinize after the degeneration of the keratinized inner root sheath (IRS) cells. These findings suggest that the lower hair follicle is composed of the IRS layers, the IMC layer, and the outer layer of the ORS in either mice or humans, although there are some morphological differences in cell differentiation in each layer between the two species.\r"

Determinations were made within the cytoplasm of individual cells. Uniform element concentrations were present throughout the viable tissue, whereas element profiles in the stratum corneum were considerably diverse. Phosphorus was practically absent from the stratum corneum. Sulfur (per unit volume) continuously increased from the inner to the outer cell layers of the stratum corneum largely as a result of cytoplasmic water loss as cells migrate to the surface. Potassium was essentially excluded from the inner stratum corneum. Very large gradients for K, Na, and Cl occurred from the middle of the stratum corneum to its outer surface; these gradients are likely the result of the inward diffusion of salts from sweat and could play a variety of physiological roles. The paucity of K and P within the inner stratum corneum suggests these important intracellular solutes (and perhaps others, including water) are recycled within the viable tissue, thus providing a virtual nutrient supply immediately underneath the stratum corneum. Alterations in this recirculation could have a regulatory function in the physiology of this tissue.\r"

Keratinocytes also catabolize thymidine, as reported for the first time below. Stratified cultures of keratinocytes reduced the amount of thymidine in the medium by more than 90% within 2 to 4 h. Consequently, the rate of incorporation of thymidine (0.2 microM, 4 microCi/ml) into DNA was linear for no more than 2 h. Linear incorporation of thymidine into DNA for at least 12 h could be achieved by continual addition of fresh radioactive thymidine to the culture medium. Different tissues have widely differing abilities to catabolize thymidine. Cutaneous catabolism of thymidine shows striking species differences. Soluble extracts from human neonatal foreskin and adult skin, as well as from cultivated human keratinocytes, actively catabolize thymidine. Soluble extracts of skin from mouse, rabbit, or guinea pig do not catabolize thymidine. Extracts from cultivated human fibroblasts and melanocytes have little or no ability to catabolize thymidine. Catabolism of thymidine by keratinocytes has important implications for the use of [3H]thymidine in studies of keratinocyte proliferation and for the use of thymidine analogs in therapy of cutaneous disease.\r"

C. diversus strain 4277, lacking the 32,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein that appears to be a marker for strains causing meningitis in human neonates, was more likely to produce bacteremia, meningitis, and death in rats than was strain 4036, which possesses this outer membrane protein. Strain 4036 was, however, more likely than strain 4277 to produce ventriculitis and brain abscess. In the infant rat, central nervous system involvement by C. diversus begins with bacteremia and leptomeningitis, followed by ventriculitis and direct extension of infection into periventricular brain parenchyma. Large numbers of bacteria persist inside inflammatory cells, an observation suggesting resistance to intraphagocytic killing. Bacterial strain differences, possibly related to the presence of a 32,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein, may account for histopathologic differences in the brains of infant rats with C. diversus meningitis.\r"

Interferon could be an important mediator in virus-induced hypersensitivity reactions, because interferon is induced by some respiratory viruses, and it can enhance IgE-mediated histamine release in vitro. We studied the effect of common respiratory viruses, including both interferon inducers and non-interferon inducers, on IgE-mediated leukocyte histamine release. Leukocytes from healthy, nonallergic donors were exposed to different strains of respiratory viruses, and basophils were challenged with antibody to IgE to release histamine. We found that the viruses are capable of enhancing IgE-mediated histamine release in the presence or absence of interferon. Our results suggest that although interferon may play a role in virus-induced hypersensivity reactions, other mechanisms probably also play a significant role.\r"

Conversely, women not possessing these risk factors were more likely to be seronegative; 69% of the women without any of the five factors lacked antibody to cytomegalovirus.

On the other hand, antibodies to phospholipids from patients with autoimmune disorders exhibited little or no binding to the VDRL antigen but cross-reacted with both cardiolipin and negatively charged phospholipids. These findings may explain why antibodies to phospholipids only from patients with autoimmune disorders may have lupus anticoagulant activity and why they are associated with thrombosis, fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia.\r"

Thirty-four (67%) infections were localized in the kidney and 17 (33%) in the bladder. Women with renal infection were older than those with bladder infection (81.9 vs. 77.6 years of age; P = .04). The antibody-coated bacteria test had a sensitivity of 58%, specificity of 71%, positive predictive value of 82%, and negative predictive value of 43% for upper-urinary-tract infection. A quantitative urinary leukocyte count of greater than or equal to 20 leukocytes/mm3 had a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 88% for upper-urinary-tract infection. This study suggests that the majority of elderly, institutionalized women with asymptomatic bacteriuria have upper-urinary-tract infection. Both the antibody-coated bacteria test and the quantitative urinary leukocyte count may be useful as noninvasive tests for localization of urinary tract infection in this population.\r"

The profile of antibodies to Toxoplasma was examined in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with chronic and acute toxoplasmosis with or without HIV infection. Many Toxoplasma antigens were recognized by all sera; the majority were presumably surface proteins, as determined by 125I labeling. All sera recognized antigens at 38, 35, 28, and 26 kilodaltons. No specific antibody or pattern of antibodies distinguished between groups of patients. A 120-kilodalton antigen recognized by sera from Atlanta was not, however, seen in most sera from New York. Study of the recognition of the antigens of different strains of Toxoplasma gondii (RH, C56, T100) by the same human sera demonstrated strain-specific antigenic differences. These strain variations may account for the antibody diversity among the patients studied.\r"

Cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, imipenem, methicillin, novobiocin, polymyxin B, rifampin, and tobramycin had varied effects. Most changes induced by these agents resulted in differing degrees of inhibition of adherence. However, an increase in adherence of 65% was observed for one strain, RP14 (ATCC 35981), with rifampin treatment. Hydrophobicity of coagulase-negative staphylococci treated with antimicrobial agents measured by using a biphasic system with hexadecane showed excellent correlation with adherence (r = .958, P less than .0005), a result suggesting that adherence of these bacteria in this system depends heavily on hydrophobic surface moieties. Transmission electron microscopy of drug-treated coagulase-negative staphylococci revealed only an increase in cell-wall thickness, regardless of whether adherence was increased or decreased.\r"

The epidemics occurred in four different garrisons from 1957 to 1985. Each lasted approximately six months, and epidemics occurred during all seasons of the year. The attack rate varied from 60 to 80 per 1000 men. Routine laboratory tests for respiratory agents suggested that these epidemics represented the only clusters of patients since 1970 who were positive for antibody to Chlamydia by complement fixation. From these epidemics, 62 of 70 paired sera that were positive for Chlamydia had antibody diagnostic of recent TWAR infection. Although the conscripts with pneumonia were hospitalized, the illnesses were relatively mild, and none were life threatening. Three conscripts had two episodes of TWAR pneumonia separated by three weeks to three months. Prompt treatment with tetracycline depressed the antibody response.\r"

Ears inoculated with encapsulated and unencapsulated pneumococci had significantly higher concentrations of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes and lysozyme in middle ear fluid and developed more epithelial metaplasia and granulation tissue than did saline-inoculated ears. The mean concentration of lysozyme in middle ear fluid was higher in ears inoculated with killed, unencapsulated than encapsulated pneumococci. The middle ear mucoperiosteum of ears inoculated with pneumococcal cell wall showed significantly more polymorphonuclear leukocytes, epithelial metaplasia, subepithelial congestion, and granulation tissue than did control ears. Because nonviable, unencapsulated pneumococci and pneumococcal cell wall caused middle ear inflammation in the chinchilla model of otitis media, it is possible that cell envelope and cell wall components released during bacterial lysis may contribute to chronic otitis media with effusion in humans.\r"

Significantly more strains causing bacteriuric episodes of long duration expressed MR/K (mannose-resistant/Klebsiella-like) hemagglutination (74%) than did those causing episodes of short duration (26%; P = .004). Isolates expressing MR/K hemagglutinin bound in higher numbers to catheter material (P = .023) than did those not expressing this hemagglutinin. Significantly more strains causing bacteriuric episodes of short duration expressed the mannose-sensitive (MS) hemagglutinin (43%) than did those causing episodes of long duration (7%; P = .014). Isolates expressing MS hemagglutinin bound significantly more 125I-labeled Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) than did isolates not expressing this hemagglutinin (P = .0001). Our results indicate that MR/K hemagglutinin plays an important role in the ability of P. stuartii to persist and suggest that MR/K adheres to the catheter. Conversely, MS hemagglutinin binds to THP and may prevent persistence of P. stuartii in the catheterized urinary tract.\r"

Previous studies implicating alpha-toxin as the major lethal factor were frequently done with preparations contaminated with a second lethal factor, theta-toxin. We purified alpha- and theta-toxins from C. perfringens and demonstrated that both were lethal to mice. We investigated the effects of these purified toxins on cardiovascular function in intact rabbits; both toxins caused profound hypotension and bradycardia within 40 min. Reduced cardiac output preceded the development of hypotension and bradycardia. Purified alpha-toxin produced a dose-dependent reduction in myocardial function in isolated rabbit atrial preparations. Purified theta-toxin did not directly inhibit myocardial function. Shock induced by alpha-toxin may be partly mediated by direct depression of myocardial function. theta-Toxin reduced cardiac output in intact animals but had no direct effects on isolated heart preparations at concentrations that induced shock in intact animals. These data suggest that theta-toxin-induced shock could be mediated by an endogenous myocardial depressant factor.\r"

We studied 35 EBV isolates: 19 from seven immunocompromised children and 16 from seven college students with mononucleosis. Analysis of the fragment length polymorphisms in this collection of isolates permitted several conclusions. Sites of polymorphism were most often encountered in regions with repetitive DNA. Epidemiologically unrelated patients harbored viruses that could be readily distinguished; by contrast, two infants and their mothers harbored similar viruses. Isolates from different sites in the same patient were similar. Variations between different clinical isolates of EBV mimic those found between different laboratory strains of the virus. Fragment length polymorphisms thus provide a useful marker for studying transmission and pathogenesis of EBV infections.\r"

Using immunoblot technology, we have demonstrated that immune serum from normal adults contains antibodies to at least 15 CMV-associated proteins and that there is strain-to-strain variation in the expression of these immunogens. The kinetics of the immune response were evaluated by using serial sera collected from normal adults after primary CMV infection; analysis of immunoblots of these sera identified one group of antibodies to CMV proteins that arise early and are stable over time, a second group that appear late after infection, and a third group that are variable among patients and over time.\r"

The risk of illness increased sharply with age, and all five fatal cases were in persons greater than 55 y. Case-control methods were used for the first time to study factors associated with the risk of acquiring SLE. Risk was associated with residences poorly sealed against mosquitoes (non-air-conditioned residences and those with inadequate screens). The number of hours spent outdoors and in outdoor activities, except sitting immediately outside residences, were not associated with risk. Our observations suggest that exposure to vector mosquitoes may have occurred indoors. No host factors were significantly associated with risk of acquiring SLE, but more cases were cigarette smokers and had family histories of hypertension or cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Forty-one electropherotypes were identified from 418 hospitalized patients with HRV infection at the Queen Mary Hospital, and 22 were detected from 66 outpatients in community clinics at a separate area in Hong Kong. Nineteen electropherotypes were detected in 370 hospitalized cases of HRV infection from seven hospitals in Guangzhou. Results showed that HRV electropherotypes appeared to circulate freely within each area, yet the HRV population between the two cities remained different. Six electropherotypes were common to both cities. Three of these were predominant types found in Guangzhou and later detected in Hong Kong. One of these was found to cause an outbreak in Hong Kong. Of the remaining three electropherotypes, two were detected in both cities simultaneously, whereas one was first detected in Hong Kong.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neurotensin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are peptides that modify various autonomic and neural functions. These substances are secreted into the blood in response to physiologic stimuli affecting the gastrointestinal tract. To determine the effect of adrenal hormones on gastrointestinal peptide release we measured blood levels of PP, VIP, substance P, and neurotensin in adrenalectomized and intact dogs undergoing cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a condition associated with maximal adrenal stimulation. One hour after completion of abdominal surgery consisting of bilateral adrenalectomy or exposure of the adrenal glands (sham operation), ventricular fibrillation was induced in 19 dogs by direct ventricular discharge. Despite marked elevations of plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine, CPR was associated with minimal endocrine gastrointestinal involvement, restricted to increased VIP levels in sham-operated dogs. No specific gastrointestinal peptide response to cardiac arrest was seen in adrenalectomized animals, but their plasma PP and VIP levels were higher than those of sham-operated dogs. Therefore, acute maximal adrenal stimulation is associated with selective VIP release. In addition, the higher level of the vagally controlled plasma PP in adrenalectomized animals suggests a tonic inhibitory effect of adrenal secretions on the release of this peptide.\r"

Adherent and nonadherent cells were sampled daily for acetylcholinesterase-positive cells and CFU-M. The proliferative capacity of CFU-M was determined by culturing cells from STLC in secondary methylcellulose cultures and counting the number of megakaryocytes per colony. Positive dose-related effects were observed between the number of megakaryocytes and CFU-M in liquid culture and the concentration of PWCM in the culture. In contrast, the proliferative capacity of CFU-M was lower in cultures containing high concentrations of PWCM compared with cultures containing low concentrations of PWCM. Furthermore, mean megakaryocyte diameter was significantly smaller in cultures containing high levels of PWCM compared with cultures with low concentrations. These data suggest that at low levels of conditioned medium, megakaryocytopoiesis is characterized by production of fewer CFU-M with a higher proliferative capacity and fewer large megakaryocytes. In turn, high concentrations of PWCM promote the production of a greater number of CFU-M with reduced proliferative capacity and an increased number of small megakaryocytes.\r"

Over a 15-day storage period, these PCs showed by in vitro markers (pH, lactic dehydrogenase, PO2, PCO2, glucose consumption, morphology, and hypotonic shock recovery) greatly improved function and integrity relative to PCs in CPDA-1 only. At day 10 of storage, the experimental PCs had higher pH (P = 0.02), better morphology scores (P less than 0.001), more rapid recovery from hypotonic shock (P = 0.03), and higher PCO2 levels (P less than 0.001) than controls in CPDA-1 only. Additional storage time increased these differences to a significance level of p less than 0.01 in all tests. The experimental anticoagulant was less effective when hirudin was absent. Plasma pH was well maintained, and less glucose was consumed in the experimental anticoagulant without the aid of an increase of buffering capacity or gas transport. These findings indicate that thrombin and platelet activation play a major role in the development of the platelet storage lesion.\r"

The present studies were designed to eliminate the possibility of the human plasminogen-plasmin system contributing to the cell detachment observed in previous complement-mediated studies. To assay for the presence of protease contamination in the reagents, a simple, sensitive, caseinolytic-fluorometric assay was used. Confluent murine or human epidermal cell cultures were incubated with pemphigus IgG with and without complement and plasminogen. Detached epidermal cells, as determined by light microscopy and cell-counter analysis, were enumerated at 48 hours. Incubating pemphigus IgG with complement resulted in marked cell detachment, compared with minimal cell detachment when pemphigus IgG was incubated with plasminogen. Culture media were collected after 48 hours and assayed for activation of plasminogen. It was determined that the added plasminogen had not been activated, particularly in experiments where significant detachment was observed. The plasminogen could still be activated by streptokinase and urokinase. These studies suggest that epidermal cell detachment in pemphigus appears to be mediated at least in part by complement activation.\r"

In thalassemic mice, Plasmodium chabaudi adami infection was inhibited and peak parasitemia was variably delayed. In transgenically corrected mice, infection proceeded as in normal mice. Plasmodium berghei infection proceeded more rapidly in thalassemic mice, but survival was not different. Splenectomized normal mice displayed high-level parasitemia that peaked twice and persisted as a low-level parasitemia for more than 20 days after normal intact mice were free of all parasites. Splenectomized thalassemic mice showed a delay of 5 days in attaining peak parasitemia, but the parasitemia persisted as in normal splenectomized mice. Thus, for P. chabaudi, which displayed no preference for immature erythrocytes, beta-thalassemia offers enhanced resistance for the host. However, for P. berghei, which preferentially invades reticulocytes, thalassemia is not protective. The protective effects of the normal mouse spleen were observed, but the paradoxical facilitation of parasite growth by the thalassemic spleen is a new finding that will require further experimentation to explain. This new in vivo laboratory documentation of thalassemic protection against some rodent malaria parasites may serve as a useful model in further efforts to control this major infectious disease.\r"

Although the amount of estrogen used to achieve the desired therapeutic effect is lower than the lowest doses in oral contraception, the age and medical condition of this population may amplify any hormone-induced risk. The common impression is that postmenopausal replacement therapy does not increase risk for thromboembolic disease, but no large epidemiologic studies of estrogen replacement have addressed that question. In this randomized prospective study, we examined the effects of varying low doses of an estrogen-progestin preparation on the titers of clotting factors in postmenopausal women. The coagulation factors selected for investigation were among those that have been reported to be significantly altered in the plasma samples of high-dose estrogen users. There were no changes in prothrombin time, factor X, fibrinogen, factor VII, or fibrinopeptide A in any of the hormone-treated groups. Mild but significant shortening of the partial thromboplastin time and elevation of factor XII titer were noted in all treatment groups. The titer of antithrombin III was reduced in the group given 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol, but not in the groups given 5 or 10 micrograms. The clinical significance of these changes is difficult to determine in postmenopausal women receiving sex hormone replacement. However, we have not noted any thromboembolic episodes in our volunteers after a 1-year follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No differences were found among the various causes of low cobalamin levels, except for the lower \"analogue\" levels among pregnant women. However, 76 patients with low cobalamin levels and primarily neurologic (spinal cord, neuropathic, cerebral, or a combination of these) symptoms had significantly higher \"analogue\" levels than 19 patients with primarily hematologic abnormalities. Moreover, the \"analogue\" levels correlated with hemoglobin values and were significantly higher in patients without megaloblastic changes in their bone marrow than in patients with megaloblastosis. An analysis limited to 47 patients with pernicious anemia yielded similar findings. The seven patients with only neurologic abnormalities had higher \"analogue\" levels than did the nine patients with only hematologic abnormalities. Because of the higher \"analogue\" levels, the assay done with R binder failed to register low cobalamin levels in 33 of 76 patients with low cobalamin levels and primarily neurologic abnormality (compared with only two of 19 with hematologic abnormality) and in 10 of 20 patients with pernicious anemia who had neurologic abnormalities (compared with only two of 12 without such abnormalities). These differences between patients with hematologic disturbances and patients with neurologic disturbances, and the inverse relationship of \"analogue\" level with severity of anemia, suggest that the disproportionate accumulation of analogues may explain why some patients with cobalamin deficiency display neurologic abnormalities while others do not.\r"

  ".U": "88089220\r", 
  ".W": "A simplified procedure for preparing washed murine platelets, free of contaminating plasma proteins, has been developed. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from diluted whole blood from C57BL/6N mice by two centrifugations at 100 x g for 12 minutes. Platelets were concentrated and then washed by centrifugation through isosmolar 10% arabinogalactan (Stractan). Platelet recovery was 85%  +/- 6% (1 SD) (n = 10) from whole blood to PRP and 86% +/- 4% (1 SD) (n = 6) from PRP to Stractan-washed platelets. Overall recovery of platelets with this technique was 73% +/- 10% (1 SD). Contamination of platelets with plasma proteins could not be detected with use of unlabeled platelets that had been incubated with radiolabeled plasma proteins followed by washing with Stractan. The Stractan-washed platelets were assessed for function by using aggregometry. The response of Stractan-washed platelets to collagen and thrombin was identical to that of unwashed platelets. Stractan-washed platelets did not respond to 20 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate unless supplemented with 12% platelet-free plasma. The morphology of the Stractan-washed platelets indicated that degranulation had not occurred. With use of antibodies directed against the alpha granule membrane protein GMP-140 or fibrinogen, no evidence of secretion or plasma protein contamination was observed. The use of this method resulted in an improved assay for the rate of thrombopoiesis, based on detection of radioactive proteins in newly synthesized platelets, by eliminating contamination by radioactive plasma proteins. Our results indicate that this procedure is a convenient method for the separation of platelets from platelet-rich plasma, free of plasma proteins, which are suitable for bioassays, functional studies, and morphologic investigations.\r"

Because fibrinogen possesses platelet recognition sites on both its alpha and gamma chains, the present study examined the hypothesis that irreversible platelet fibrinogen interactions occurred as a result of multivalent fibrinogen binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complexes. Fibrinogen binding to human, gel-filtered platelets was assessed by using intact fibrinogen and a plasmic fibrinogen degradation product (8D-50) lacking intact alpha chains and resembling an intermediate fragment X. Irreversibly bound fibrinogen was defined as fibrinogen that remained associated with thrombin-stimulated platelets in the presence of 10 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or excess unlabeled fibrinogen. The amount of intact fibrinogen that bound irreversibly to platelets comprised 54% +/- 12% (mean +/- SD, n = 8) of total binding. It was unaffected by fibrinogen receptor saturation and platelet alpha granule release. Similar amounts of 8D-50 (56% +/- 10%) bound irreversibly to platelets. Addition of 50 mumol/L arginine-glycine-asparagine-serine, after the initial binding of either fibrinogen or 8D-50, had no effect on the subsequent stabilization of platelet-fibrinogen or platelet-8D-50 interactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the utility of the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a high-risk group of 50 firefighters who had had an intense exposure to a natural disaster 8 months before being interviewed. Follow-up over the next 3 years allowed examination of the ability of these diagnostic criteria to predict a pattern of chronic posttraumatic morbidity. They predicted a pattern of chronic disorder, demonstrated by the finding that eight of the 15 subjects who had definite or borderline PTSD at 8 months remained symptomatic 3 years later. A disturbance of attention and concentration appeared to be the best predictor of chronic PTSD. The longitudinal course of posttraumatic morbidity in these 50 firefighters was compared with a matched group of 96 uninterviewed subjects 11 and 29 months after the disaster. Although the interview provoked an emotional catharsis in a number of firefighters, the long-term morbidity in the two groups was comparable. Fourteen subjects who did not have PTSD continued to experience intense imagery 8 months after the disaster. This observation raises questions about whether such thoughts and feelings have adequate specificity as diagnostic criteria for PTSD in a group that has recently been exposed to a traumatic event.\r"

Predisaster variables were found to be as important in the onset and course of the disorder as were the firefighters' losses or extent of exposure to the disaster. These data suggest that exposure to an extreme trauma is necessary but not sufficient to explain the onset and pattern of posttraumatic morbidity.\r"

  ".U": "88089749\r", 
  ".W": "Although most teratogens are suspected to act early in the first trimester of pregnancy, birth defects monitoring programs and etiologic studies usually use residence at birth as a proxy measure for residence in the first trimester in searching for environmental teratogens. Because of the high mobility of the U.S. population, residence misclassification can potentially alter inferences concerning environmental teratogens. To evaluate this potential bias, data from the population-based Maryland Birth Defects Reporting and Information System were analyzed. In 1984, the system ascertained 295 infants with one or more of 12 sentinel defects. Of these cases, 59 (20%) mothers reported they have changed address between the time of conception and the time of birth, and 22 have moved to a different county. The residential mobility rate varied by demographic variables and was highest among white women, in the age group 20-24 years. If residence at birth is used as a screening test for residence at conception, it can be shown that in the presence of an environmental teratogenic exposure, misclassification of exposure increases with increasing mobility rate, and population exposure frequency. Such misclassification tends to weaken associations between residence and birth defects and may lead to missing environmental teratogens. This analysis emphasizes the need to use residence information early in pregnancy rather than exclusively at birth.\r"

Of the cases 47% were screened at least once, while for the controls this figure was 68%. The relative risk of getting invasive cervical cancer for women screened at least once compared to women who were never screened was 0.32. The most important confounding factor was age at first intercourse. Contrary to other studies however, it was found that women who were younger when having first intercourse were screened more often. After correcting the relative risk of screened vs unscreened for age at first intercourse, the relative risk became 0.22. When the length of the interval since the last smear was considered, the relative risk was 0.18 when the smear was made between 2 and 5 years earlier and 0.30 when this smear was made more than 5 years earlier. These results support the assumption that screening is effective in the prevention of invasive cancer of the uterine cervix. Even a screening interval of more than 5 years provides considerable protection.\r"

Using the computerized data-system of the Periodical Medical Examination (PME) of Phillips' International Electrical Company, a case-control study was carried out. Cases were male workers (n = 104, from 50 to 60 years of age) who had suffered a first, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and who had had a PME prior (on the average 16 months) to the occurrence of infarction. For each case two age-matched healthy controls were selected from the PME-attendancy list (= 208). For each subject information was abstracted from the PME-records about haematologic parameters and covariates (smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, pulse-rate, weight, height, FEV5, consumption of antihypertensive agents). After dichotomizing the haematocrit and haemoglobin values at their whole sample means (0.46 l/l and 9.7 mmol/l respectively) in \"low\" (lower than or equal to the mean) and \"high\" (greater than the mean), crude odds-ratio's of 2.7 (95% CI: 1.6-4.6) and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2-3.6) were found for Ht and Hb respectively, when comparing \"high\" with \"low\" levels. The associations between Ht and Hb, and the occurrence of myocardial infarction were still present after controlling for covariates using multiple logistic regression models, entering the continuous variables with their exact values. After adjustment, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) also appeared to be correlated with infarction. Our results confirm the hypothesis that moderately high haematocrit and--to a lesser extent--haemoglobin and MCV-values are risk factors for the occurrence of myocardial infarction.\r"

To facilitate comparisons of outcomes, data from a large anesthesia follow-up program (N = 112,000 anesthetics) were used to evaluate the usefulness of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status score (PS) as an independent predictor of nonfatal adverse anesthetic complications. For each patient, the anesthesiologist filled out a form containing information about the patient, the anesthetic, the operative procedure, and outcomes in the operating and recovery rooms. Postoperative complications were assessed by a designated anesthesia follow-up nurse. We calculated the PS-specific complication rate by dividing the number of complications to patients in each PS category by the number of anesthetics given to patients in the same category. We found that PS-specific complication rates increased with increasing PS scores for most complications sought. For intraoperative and recovery room complications, the PS-specific rates increased from 1978-80 and 1981-83 as compared to 1975-77. However, there was no increase over time in the rate of postoperative major complications. After adjusting for patient, anesthesia, and surgery-related variables by multiple logistic regression, the relative odds of having an intraoperative or postoperative major complication were increased for patients classified PS2, PS3 and PS4 & 5 as compared to PS1. However, those in higher PS categories were less likely to have a recovery room complication than PS1 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 1380 men screened by sigmoidoscopy for colorectal polyps, 246 had at least one polyp. The men with polyps were older than those without, and also had higher cholesterol levels, but after controlling for age, there were no serum cholesterol differences. These data suggest that low serum cholesterol is not etiologically linked to cancer. Analyses of potentially confounding variables showed smoking to be strongly related to the presence of polyps.\r"

The prevalence odds ratio for having that disorder in first degree relatives was 10.0. Stratifying by class of relatives, the prevalence odds ratio was 8.1 for fathers, 35.8 for mothers, 12.7 for siblings, and 3.3 for offspring. The increased prevalence odds ratio for mothers over that of fathers suggests a maternal effect. Since both males and females reported on the anomaly for each parental type, it is unlikely that the difference in prevalence odds ratios is due to general reporting bias.\r"

Analysis was done on data from one twin pair member only. Three groups were identified: 3617 never smokers, 2654 persistent smokers, and 823 quitters (i.e. current smokers in 1975, former smokers in 1981). Univariate and multivariate comparisons of baseline psychosocial variables for quitters and persistent smokers were performed in men aged 20-34 and 35-54 and women aged 20-39. Among women and young men quitters were better educated and scored lower on neuroticism. Young male quitters also slept longer, had been less often unemployed and drank less alcohol and coffee. Among middle-aged men quitters were more often married, slept longer, and had higher life satisfaction. The possibility that the influence of psychosocial factors on chronic disease may be mediated in part through changes in smoking behavior is discussed.\r"

There was an impact on diagnosis in 90% of patients. Most common was confirmation of diagnosis usually with the addition of information pertinent to management (81%); change of disease category or resolution of diagnostic doubt was uncommon (9%). The consultant cardiologist believed the heart to be normal in 48 patients who did not have any associated disease; none had any echocardiographic abnormality. The cardiologist reported increased diagnostic confidence in 74% of all patients but management changed in only 9%. One-third of all patients reported reduced anxiety when this was an important clinical issue but in less than half of them did the cardiologist consider that echocardiographic information was essential for reassurance. Anxiety was increased in 6%, and in 12% the anxiety response was inconsistent with the test result. The clinical contribution of the test report was most obvious for those patients (30%) in whom this data was required for (a) a decision concerning specific diagnostic or technical intervention (b) a change of management plan which implied obvious or likely health benefit (c) reassurance which was a clinically important issue. The magnitude of this contribution was related to the study indication. The value of echocardiography is obvious when assessing patients for invasive intervention or when proper treatment or adequate reassurance are impeded by diagnostic doubt. However, for many current indications, we need better definition of factors which predict a clinically useful result. In particular, when the aim is to rule-out disease, our results suggest that an expert cardiological opinion would often be more appropriate than an echocardiogram.\r"

Self-assessment of health is a significant predictor of hospital days for the total cohort (including those with no admissions); so are age at onset of disability (greater age; higher risk), and bed disability days in the month before the baseline survey (more disability days; higher risk). Among those hospitalized, the total number of days hospitalized is significantly related to both age at onset of disability (later onset; more days) and baseline days hospitalized (greater number; more days). Lengths-of-stay are significantly related to two factors; age and age at onset of disability (in both cases, greater age associated with longer stays). Prior ER visits are a significant predictor of subsequent ER visits (more baseline; more subsequent); so are respondents' reported satisfaction with their participation in their medical care (lower reported satisfaction; more ER visits), organizational affiliations, and frequencies of contacts with friends or relatives. Higher levels of social interaction (i.e. organizational affiliation and more frequent social contacts) were associated with more ER visits. Prior contacts with physicians, nurse-practitioners, or physician-assistants was the most powerful predictor of subsequent outpatient contacts (more baseline; more subsequent). There were also significant relationships between subsequent contacts and respondents' assessments of their health relative to others with similar disabilities (relatively worse health; more contacts), age (greater age; more contacts), and baseline ER visits (more visits; more contacts).\r"

Analysis of covariance showed no relationship between age and discharge MBI score; however, patients with paraplegia, incomplete lesions, and greater admission functional ratings had greater discharge functional scores than did those with quadriplegia, complete lesions, and lower admission scores, respectively. Advancing age was associated with increased dependence in only seven functional skills (bathing, upper and lower body dressing, stair climbing, and transfers to chair, toilet and bath) and only for patients with complete paraplegia. Other MBI component tasks and patients with complete quadriplegia, incomplete paraplegia and incomplete quadriplegia demonstrated no relationship between age and skill performance. Results of this study support the practice of providing comprehensive rehabilitation services to all patients following spinal cord injury regardless of age.\r"

This technique is shown to result in an inaccurate estimate of exposure. It underestimates by 11 years the latency period from peak exposure to peak mortality. Over the years, cigarettes changed markedly. Filters came into prominence and tobacco was \"fluffed\". On average, tobacco content of cigarettes decreased 39.1% from 1953 to 1981. National per capita consumption of cigarette tobacco declined by 43%. Total exposure to cigarette tobacco has been declining for males for approximately 35 years; for females for 20 years. As of 1982, the secular trend for lung cancer mortality was declining for women below age 45 and for most age groups of men below 65. We appear to be at the threshold of a reversal in overall lung cancer mortality.\r"

The referral center patient group differed from those that remained in the population-based group in the following important ways: (1) they were younger, (2) they had more mobility impairment for their age, (3) disabled females were overrepresented compared to disabled males, (4) they more often reported recent disease worsening, (5) they had a higher frequency of early diagnosis supported by laboratory tests, and (6) they more often relied on neurologists and therapists for routine care of their disease. The multiple sclerosis referral center setting would appear to be ideal for the conduct of intervention trials, but inadequate for collecting representative natural history data.\r"

For the entire group, the 5-year crude survival rate was 68% and the actuarial rate was 80%. Survival decreased with increasing bowel wall penetration by tumor and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Although survival varied with the tumor site, none of the differences was statistically significant. Other variables, including the grade of adenocarcinoma, size, and the type of surgery had a significant impact on survival. Patterns of failure, expressed as the actuarial incidence of first diagnosed failure at 5 years, were examined by stage and site. There was a trend toward increased failure with increasing bowel wall penetration by tumor and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Abdominal failure, either as the only site or as a component of failure, was the most common type of failure. When compared by site, patients with cecal carcinoma had a significantly lower incidence of local and distant failure than patients with disease in other selected sites. No differences in patterns of failure were seen in patients with carcinomas in the mobile sections of the colon compared with those who had disease arising in the nonmobile sections of the colon. These data may be useful in identifying those patients who might benefit most from adjuvant therapy.\r"

Patients whose tumors had BVI experienced a significant decrease in the 5-year actuarial survival rate. BVI had little impact on the patterns of failure in stage B2 disease, but a significant increase in total failure and local failure (as a component of failure) occurred in stage C2. However, when examined by proportional hazards analysis, BVI was found not to be an independent prognostic variable. For patients with stage C2 tumors, which are also BVI+, radiation therapy to the tumor bed might play a contributory role in overall management.\r"

Factors at diagnosis associated with prolonged survival for the subset of patients with pleural mesothelioma included epithelial histology, 0 to 1 performance status, the absence of chest pain, an interval of greater than 6 months from onset of symptoms, and treatment with chemotherapy and pleuropneumonectomy.

The development of new lesions (shown by Tc99m bone scans) in cancer patients with normal neurological examinations is further evaluated with plain radiographs, spinal computed tomography (CT), and CT myelography (CT-M). Of 60 patients in the original study, 28% were diagnosed as having only benign disease and the remainder had spinal metastases. Thecal sac impingement was seen in 47% of patients with metastatic disease and disruption of the posterior vertebral cortex was noted in all patients with epidural compression. We now report the 2-year follow-up of 55 of these patients. Without treatment, the 17 patients diagnosed with benign disease have shown no evidence of local failure in the spine and median survival is greater than 27 months. Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with spinal metastases had a median survival time of 16.9 months. Radiation therapy directed by CT-M findings provided pain relief in 78% of patients with back pain and metastatic disease. No patient, including 19 with thecal sac impingement, developed clinical myelopathy. These results demonstrate the usefulness of an imaging algorithm for the early identification and distinction of spinal metastatic disease and benign disease in patients with cancer.\r"

The study was designed to assess toxicity of two courses of treatment, and evaluate response rates after this short therapy. The creatinine clearance declined in seven of 15 patients. No patient experienced clinically significant hearing loss, but formal audiometric assessment of nine children revealed characteristic high tone loss in seven patients. Peripheral neuropathy was not seen. Asymptomatic hypomagnesemia (less than 0.7 microEq/L) was frequent, despite routine supplementation. Asymptomatic electrolyte imbalances occurred frequently, but were generally transient. Myelosuppression was severe, but brief. Seven patients required platelet transfusions and seven were readmitted between courses due to febrile episodes while neutropenic. There were no treatment-related deaths. According to strictly defined criteria, 12 of 17 patients showed a partial response (PR), and extensive marrow evaluation showed complete clearing of disease in six of 15 patients. This high-dose regimen, if carefully supervised, is associated with acceptable toxicity, comparable to that seen when the dose of CPDD is spread over several months. The rapidity and degree of response was encouraging and merits further evaluation.\r"

A potential limitation to cyclophosphamide use is its urotoxicity, primarily in the form of hemorrhagic cystitis. The incidence of this adverse effect in patients treated for Ewing's sarcoma has not been established. In a Mayo Clinic series of 116 patients with Ewing's sarcoma treated with cyclophosphamide, 17 (15%) developed hemorrhagic cystitis diagnosed on the basis of gross hematuria or cystoscopic findings (or both). Microscopic hematuria also occurred in 53% of patients (56 of 105 examined). The dose and duration of therapy appeared to be unrelated to the development of urotoxicity. Most patients recovered uneventfully with or without discontinuation of cyclophosphamide therapy, but a significant loss of blood occurred in three patients, and one patient required a cystectomy because of bladder fibrosis. Long-term follow-up is mandatory in these patients because of late recurrences of hemorrhagic cystitis or the possibility of bladder carcinoma. New therapies, directed at protecting the bladder from urotoxicity during cyclophosphamide treatment, are available.\r"

The cases were collected through a cooperative effort of 57 surgeons at eight hospitals in the Detroit area and coordinated by the Michigan Cancer Foundation where data collection and analyses were completed. The primary treatment of all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Of the 1,078 cases accessioned between October 1975 and April 1983, 537 were found to have no microscopic lymph node involvement and 462 of these cases received no adjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The period of follow-up of these cases (alive, n = 358) has been 78.75 +/- 24.6 months (mean +/- SD). Overall, the cumulative 6-year recurrence rate as calculated by life table analysis was 26%, with 16.8% dying of their disease. Tumor size was an important prognostic factor; the recurrence rate was 16.2% for those with primaries measuring less than or equal to 1 cm, with only a 6.3% mortality. Patients with tumors measuring greater than 5 cm also did well: 13.7% recurrence and 13.7% mortality rates at 6 years. The premenopausal women did slightly, but not statistically significantly, better than those who were postmenopausal. The presence or absence of quantifiable estrogen receptor protein (ER) was of little predictive value as far as rates of recurrence were concerned, but patients with an ER-positive tumor survived significantly longer. In postmenopausal women, those whose tumor lacked ER (n = 112) fared poorly: 30.4% experienced a recurrence by 6 years and 28% died of their disease. Recurrence rates and death rates were also high in a small group (n = 35) of postmenopausal women with ER+ tumors exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism (nuclear grade [NG]3) (38% and 24.3%, respectively). No poor prognosis group of premenopausal women was identified.\r"

The overall response rate was 78% among patients with no prior chemotherapy, 42% among patients with prior chemotherapy not including cisplatin, and 22% among patients with prior chemotherapy including cisplatin. Overall response rates to iproplatin were 6.4% and 54% in patients with/without clinical evidence of tumor resistance to cisplatin. Thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity, median time to nadir and to recovery being 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Patients who had received prior chemotherapy regimens for greater than 1 year showed a 10% greater reduction in platelet count (mean platelet nadir +/- SD, 57.5 +/- 49.96 X 10(3)/microL) and a higher incidence of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia after the first cycle than patients who had received prior chemotherapy regimens for less than 1 year (94.7 +/- 65.99 X 10(3)/microL) Moderate to severe vomiting and diarrhea occurred in 84% and 16% of patients pretreated with chemotherapy. Neuropathy (6%) was reported only in patients with prior cisplatin treatment. Mild and reversible renal toxicity was observed in 6% of cases. Iproplatin is an active drug in ovarian cancer; the results achieved in patients previously treated with cisplatin strongly suggest that the two drugs are cross-resistant.\r"

As only short grafts were used in those studies, the present investigation was conducted to evaluate the ability of long acellular basal lamina nerve grafts and equivalent cellular grafts to support axonal regeneration for nerve gap repair. Cellular grafts consisted of nerve segments that had degenerated in situ for 4 weeks. Acellular grafting material consisted of similar segments that were repeatedly frozen and thawed to kill all cells prior to grafting. The results show that host axons can regenerate through the entire 4-cm length of cellular grafts but not through acellular basal lamina grafts. However, in the acellular grafts numerous axons were seen in the proximal 2-cm region. It is concluded that basal lamina grafts possess limited ability to support axonal regeneration. As in cellular grafts, viable Schwann cells appear to be important for regeneration to occur over longer distances.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of the retrograde degeneration of corticospinal axons following transection of the spinal cord was studied in rats by labeling corticospinal axons with anterogradely transported horseradish peroxidase injected in the sensorimotor cortex. Axotomized corticospinal axons underwent progressive and continuing retrograde degeneration. In specimens examined 5, 14, 28, and 56 days after trauma, the tips of the transected corticospinal axons were seen to terminate at 181 +/- 80 microns, 977 +/- 203 microns, 1751 +/- 344 microns, and 2559 +/- 466 microns (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively, from the site of transection. The rate of retrograde degeneration varied according to the interval after spinal cord transection, as follows: 36.2 microns/day during the first 5 days; 88.4 microns/day between 5 and 14 days; 55.3 microns/day between 14 and 28 days; and 28.8 microns/day between 28 and 56 days. These findings may serve as useful parameters for the objective assessment of therapeutic modalities in spinal cord injury research.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the effect of hypovolemic hypotension on high-energy phosphate metabolism in head injury, sequential changes in in vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (31P MR) spectra were compared in 35 rats after impact injury with and without hypotension. Fourteen rats were subjected to hypotension alone (mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of either 40 or 30 mm Hg for 60 minutes), seven to fluid-percussion impact injury (4 to 5 atm) alone, and 14 to impact injury and hypotension (MABP of 40 to 30 mm Hg). Impact injury alone caused a transient decrease in the phosphocreatine (PCr) level and an increase in the inorganic phosphate (Pi) value. While hypotension alone produced only small changes on 31P MR spectra, impact injury plus hypotension caused pronounced changes. Impact injury and an MABP of 40 mm Hg caused a 50% decrease in PCr concentration and an approximately twofold increase in Pi level, which were significantly greater than values in rats with impact injury alone. Impact injury and an MABP of 30 mm Hg also caused a significant decrease in adenosine triphosphate value, which was not observed in rats with impact injury alone or with an MABP of 30 mm Hg alone. Decreases in intracellular pH were greater in rats with impact injury and hypotension. After traumatic injury, the brain is extremely vulnerable to hypovolemic hypotension, as reflected in the loss of high-energy phosphates in brain.\r"

  ".W": "Local cerebral glucose utilization was measured with the autoradiographic 2-deoxyglucose technique in rats injured by a focal parietal cortical freeze lesion then treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). The cold lesion depressed glucose utilization in the contralateral as well as in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The largest decreases were observed in ipsilateral cortical areas. Treatment of lesioned animals with HBO at 2 atm for 90 minutes on each of 4 consecutive days tended to increase the overall cerebral glucose utilization measured 5 days after injury when compared to animals exposed to normobaric air. This improvement reached statistical significance in five of the 21 structures studied: the auditory cortex, medial geniculate body, superior olivary nucleus, and lateral geniculate body ipsilateral to the lesion, and the mammillary body. The data indicate that changes in lesioned rats exposed to HBO are not restricted to the period of time that the animals are in the hyperbaric chamber but are persistent.\r"

These relatively uncommon injuries can be characterized by four distinct injury patterns: fracture only, fracture with subluxation, subluxation only, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality. The immature pediatric spine has several anatomical and biomechanical features that distinguish it from the mature adolescent spine and, accordingly, the frequency of the injury type, the level of spine injury, and the incidence of neurological compromise were found to vary with the age of the patient. Follow-up data were obtained in 93% of the cases (median duration 44 months). No patient was made worse by treatment, 89% of the patients with incomplete myelopathy on admission were improved on their last examination, and 20% of the patients with a complete myelopathy had evidence of significant recovery of function. The authors conclude that the outcome after pediatric spinal trauma is good.\r"
