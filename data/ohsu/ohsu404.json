  ".W": "The acyl coenzyme A (CoA):6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) acyltransferase of Penicillium chrysogenum AS-P-78 was purified to homogeneity, as concluded by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular weight of 30,000 +/- 1,000 and a pI of about 5.5. The optimal pH and temperature were 8.0 and 25 degrees C, respectively. This enzyme converts 6-APA into penicillin by using phenylacetyl CoA or phenoxyacetyl CoA as acyl donors. The pure enzyme showed a high specificity and affinity for 6-APA and did not accept benzylpenicillin, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, cephalosporin C, or isocephalosporin C as substrates. The enzyme converted isopenicillin N into penicillin G, although with a lower efficiency than when 6-APA was used as the substrate. It did not show penicillin G acylase activity. The acyl CoA:6-APA acyltransferase required dithiothreitol or other thiol-containing compounds, and it was protected by thiol-containing reagents against thermal inactivation. The acyltransferase was inhibited by several divalent and trivalent cations and by p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. The activity was absent in four different mutants that were blocked in penicillin biosynthesis.\r"

Our results confirm the noted resistance of the M. avium complex to conventional antituberculosis agents. The procedures used were both agar dilution and broth dilution, including a commercially available radiometric system (BACTEC; Johnston Laboratories, Towson, Md.). In general, all strains were more resistant by an agar dilution procedure than by a broth dilution procedure. Radiometric data were analyzed by defining a value, termed T100, which provides a discrete MIC. The broth (radiometric) procedure is reproducible and convenient for screening antimicrobial agents for in vitro activity and assessing potential therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, there is no standard procedure for determining the in vitro susceptibility of the M. avium complex, and appropriate clinical correlation studies are needed to accurately assess the clinical relevance of any in vitro result.\r"

Three World Health Organization reference strains (III, V, and VII) were similarly evaluated. Inoculum preparation method did not significantly alter the MIC (i.e., within a twofold dilution) of either susceptible or chromosomally resistant non-penicillinase-producing isolates; MICs achieved by the template method were slightly higher, but these differences were not significant. However, with penicillinase-producing and tetracycline-resistant isolates, the template method, which delivered 10(4) CFU, produced unequivocal MICs (denoting clinical resistance) which were significantly higher than MICs observed with the opacity standard method (inoculum, 10(3) CFU). With penicillin-, spectinomycin-, and erythromycin-containing medium, addition of hemoglobin to the medium produced lower, though not significantly different, MICs with all isolates as compared with MICs on medium without hemoglobin. Media supplemented with hemoglobin produced higher tetracycline MICs with all isolates, which were significantly different (greater than twofold) from MICs on the same hemoglobin-free media. Changes in auxotype did not alter overall observations concerning the effects of different media and inocula on MICs.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of a combination of a beta-lactam (ceftazidime) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (dicloxacillin) to synergistically kill a ceftazidime-resistant variant, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA-48, which overproduces type Id cephalosporinase constitutively. In vitro, dicloxacillin plus ceftazidime exerted bactericidal synergy at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml of inoculum (but not at approximately 10(7)-CFU inoculum), whereas other beta-lactamase inhibitors (sulbactam, clavulanic acid) showed no enhanced killing of PA-48 when combined with ceftazidime at clinically achievable levels for each agent. Dicloxacillin was a potent competitive inhibitor of the extracted Id cephalosporinase from strain PA-48 in short-term comixture studies (less than 10 min [Ki = 2 nM]); in contrast, longer-term comixture studies (90 min) indicated that dicloxacillin functions as a competitive substrate for the enzyme. Growth of PA-48 cells in the presence of dicloxacillin (12.5 to 100 micrograms/ml) had no significant effect on the production rates or functional activity of the Id enzyme. In experimental aortic valve endocarditis due to the ceftazidime-resistant variant (PA-48), rabbits received either no therapy, ceftazidime (25 mg/kg intramuscularly, every 4 h), or ceftazidime plus dicloxacillin (200 mg/kg intramuscularly, every 4 h). The combination regimen reduced mean bacterial densities of PA-48 within cardiac vegetations significantly below those in the other groups at both days 3 and 6 of treatment (P less than 0.005). However, mean vegetation bacterial densities remained greater than 6 log10 CFU/g in the combined treatment group. This modest in vivo synergistic effect (as compared to striking in vitro synergy at approximately 10(5)-CFU inoculum) most likely reflects the high densities of PA-48 achieved in vivo within cardiac vegetations (greater than 8 log10 CFU/g).\r"

  ".W": "Resistance emerging after fluoroquinolone therapy was investigated in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Mice were infected intraperitoneally by one of six strains and treated with pefloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In mice challenged with a low inoculum (1.6 X 10(5) CFU), no resistance occurred. With a higher inoculum (1.5 X 10(8) CFU) and after a single dose of antibiotic, posttherapy (PT1) strains with decreased susceptibility to quinolones (4- to 32-fold less) were isolated at a variable rate. The presence of talcum (125 mg) in the peritoneal cavity increased the risk of resistance after therapy. Pefloxacin (25 or 200 mg/kg) and ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg) yielded similar resistance rates (61 to 77%), but ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg) produced more resistance (83%) than did ciprofloxacin (50 mg/kg) (44%) (P less than 0.02). Combined with a quinolone, ceftazidime (P less than 0.001) or amikacin (P less than 0.01), but not piperacillin, reduced the emergence of resistance. After several doses of ciprofloxacin, it was found that 25-mg/kg doses every 12 h produced more resistance than did 25-mg/kg doses every 8 h or 50-mg/kg doses every 12 h. Compared with the preceding experiments using parent strains, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were less efficient in killing bacteria in mice infected with PT1 strains. Moreover, in one of these mice, a highly resistant PT2 strain (64-fold MIC increase for the quinolones) emerged. Besides increased MICs of the quinolones, there was a two- to eightfold increase in imipenem MIC for all PT1 and PT2 strains without alteration of other beta-lactam and aminoglycoside susceptibility. Some PT1 strains also showed a decreased susceptibility to trimethoprim and chloramphenicol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemorrhage of 40% of the blood volume produced significant (p less than 0.01) decreases in mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output and a significant increase in heart rate (HR), plasma renin activity, and catecholamines (p less than 0.01). Hemorrhage was also associated with a significant increase in ANF (p less than 0.05). All parameters except HR returned to baseline values with RESUS. The rise in ANF associated with moderate hemorrhage was unexpected, but may have been due to the profound tachycardia or decreased degradation during shock. Sodium excretion and urine flow increased significantly with RESUS without an associated increase in ANF, suggesting that ANF may not be involved in the early phase of postresuscitation diuresis.\r"

In the 1990s, general internists will find a surplus of specialists and subspecialists and an aging population. One of their major concerns will be controlling health care costs using a number of different strategies. Two of the major methods to control costs will be to place a greater emphasis on ambulatory care and to avoid hospitalization of patients whenever possible. To best prepare general internists, residency program directors will need to improve education in clinical practice by including more teaching in continuity of care in ambulatory settings, improved teaching of new content for practice, and increasing the number of program graduates entering practice as general internists.\r"

Significant differences emerged between the three groups in age, marital status, age at onset, number of prior hospitalizations and prior suicide attempts, organic features, and outcome measures (recovery and death rates). Patients were divided into four treatment groups based on primary mode of therapy during index admission; the groups included electroconvulsive therapy, adequate lithium carbonate, inadequate lithium carbonate, and neither treatment. Uncomplicated manics were significantly more likely to receive adequate lithium carbonate and less likely to receive inadequate lithium carbonate than were complicated manics. The latter patients had a significantly poorer immediate response to treatment overall, and to adequate lithium carbonate specifically. Seventy-eight (68.4%) uncomplicated manics had recovered ad discharge, compared with 26 (45.6%) complicated manics. Logistic regression suggested that the influence of comorbidity on outcome was more important for women than men. We conclude that complicated mania is a useful clinical construct.\r"

Control studies were also performed following administration of saline and ibuprofen alone. Vital signs, metabolic rate, and concentrations of pituitary and stress hormones, as well as those of other substrates, were serially measured. Endotoxin administration produced a response similar to an acute illness, with flulike symptoms, fever, tachycardia, increased metabolic rate, and stimulation of stress hormone release. These changes were markedly attenuated by cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. The leukocytosis, hypoferremia, and elevation of the C-reactive protein level induced by endotoxin were unaffected by cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. These data indicate that activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway is necessary to produce many of the metabolic changes observed during critical illness.\r"

Biostim administered by gastric intubation at dosages of 10 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for five days following thermal trauma did not prevent the DTH suppression induced by the thermal injury, but resulted in a significant dose-related increase in the amount of anti-tetanus toxoid antibody produced. In the malnourished rats given biostim at dosages of 10 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for seven days, there was a significant dose-related increase in the DTH response in the presence of continued protein depletion in these animals, with a modest but significant reduction in the S aureus 502a skin abscess at three days. Antibody production was not affected with this model. Biostim partially overcomes the suppression in humoral immunity following thermal injury, but not cell-mediated or nonspecific immunity. On the other hand, biostim augments both the cell-mediated and nonspecific immune suppression induced by prolonged protein deprivation but does not affect humoral immunity.\r"

Use of steroids was recorded because of our suspicion that steroids increase mortality but blunt the physiologic response to sepsis. Thirty-one patients died, including 12 of 19 patients receiving steroids. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that the APACHE II score and steroid use were each independently associated with the rate of mortality. We report a prospective validation of pretreatment APACHE II scoring in abdominal sepsis. Steroid use is an independent risk factor.\r"

  ".W": "The macrophage exerts its stimulatory and regulatory functions within the specific immune response via the interleukin 1 (IL-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), respectively. In a screening study of macrophage-related variables following injury, a total of 58 patients (mean age, 32 years; mean injury Severity Score, 38), macrophagic phenotyping with the monoclonal antibody Leu M3 and serial measuring of the antagonistic monokines IL-1 and PGE2 and of the macrophage-activating lymphokine interferon gamma were carried out on posttrauma days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21. The posttraumatic course was characterized by significant monocytosis, showing a peak value of 32% of Leu M3-positive cells compared with 15% of these cells in normal control subjects. During the posttrauma course, the macrophagic PGE2 output was significantly elevated up to eightfold on days 5 and 7 compared with that of control subjects (0.441 +/- 0.14 ng/mL vs 0.052 +/- 0.01 ng/mL). Conversely, macrophagic IL-1 synthesis was significantly suppressed until day 10. Levels of interferon gamma were suppressed to a significant degree during the two-day observation period, with a trend to slow recovery at the end of week 3. These data suggest that a negative regulatory macrophagic function may be the event initiating posttraumatic immunosuppression. To restore impaired macrophagic T-helper cell interaction, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition and substitution of interferon gamma may be useful to potentiate facilitatory macrophagic function and to block inhibitory macrophagic activity.\r"

The median onset was 29 days after operation. Thirteen viral infections were identified, with a median onset of 18 days after operation. Nine fungal infections, six disseminated and three localized, were identified, with a median onset of nine days after operation. Infection was the primary cause of death in five (14%) of 35 patients. Fatal infections were evenly distributed among bacterial (two), fungal (three), and viral (two) pathogens. Despite advances in surgical techniques and the use of cyclosporine, infection after orthotopic liver transplantation is a serious problem. Certain patients can be identified as high risks for infection and require an aggressive diagnostic workup followed by early institution of antimicrobial therapy.\r"

Quantitation of bacterial killing was achieved by culturing corneal homogenates and counting viable bacteria per cornea after treatment. When the rabbits received two iontophoretic treatments, iontophoresis significantly reduced the number of bacterial colony-forming units, compared with the use of an eyecup without current or two subconjunctival injections of 20 mg of tobramycin sulfate, and with untreated controls. The results of iontophoresis were not significantly different from those involving treatment with topical fortified drops (40 mg/mL). A single iontophoresis treatment was compared with the use of an eyecup without current or less fortified topical drops (13.6 mg/mL), as well as with untreated controls. Iontophoresis was significantly better than either the eyecup or the topical fortified tobramycin drops in reducing viable bacteria in the corneas. Iontophoresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of severe corneal bacterial infections.\r"

Analysis of variance demonstrated that the specific activity of the enzyme system in lymphocytes was significantly lower in the MTX-treated group, with an activity approximately one-half that of the control and the non-MTX-treated groups. Since the C1 index is one of the first biochemical parameters found to be different between MTX-treated and non-MTX-treated groups, alterations in folate-mediated amino acid metabolism may be involved in the mechanism of response to MTX therapy. Use of the C1 index may assist in the development of protocols which preserve the efficacy of MTX therapy while minimizing toxicity.\r"

The same crystals also directly induced collagenase and prostaglandin E2 secretion by rabbit chondrocytes, and potentiated the action of interleukin-1/mononuclear cell factor on chondrocytes. These mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis of the destructive arthropathies associated with these crystals.\r"

  ".W": "Connective tissue activating peptide-V (CTAP-V) is a single-chain, mesenchymal cell-derived anionic protein with large and small molecular forms (Mr of 28,000 and 16,000, respectively), as defined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins have similar specific activities with respect to stimulation of hyaluronic acid and DNA formation in human synovial fibroblast cultures. S-carboxymethylation or removal of sialic acid residues did not modify CTAP-V biologic activity. Rabbit antibodies raised separately against each of the purified CTAP-V proteins reacted, on immunodiffusion and on Western blot, with each antigen and neutralized mitogenic activity. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the CTAP-V proteins, determined by 2 laboratories, confirmed their structural similarities. The amino-terminal sequence through 37 residues was demonstrated for the smaller protein. The first 10 residues of CTAP-V (28 kd) were identical to the N-terminal decapeptide of CTAP-V (16 kd). The C-terminal sequence, determined by carboxypeptidase Y digestion, was the same for both CTAP-V molecular species. The 2 CTAP-V peptides had similar amino acid compositions, whether residues were expressed as a percent of the total or were normalized to mannose. Reduction of native CTAP-V protein released sulfhydryl groups in a protein:disulfide ratio of 1:2; this suggests that CTAP-V contains 2 intramolecular disulfide bonds. Clearly, CTAP-V is a glycoprotein. The carbohydrate content of CTAP-V (16 kd) and CTAP-V (28 kd) is 27% and 25%, respectively. CTAP-V may have significance in relation to autocrine mechanisms for growth regulation of connective tissue cells and other cell types.\r"

  ".W": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS, is thought to bind to T4+ (CD4+) target cells through the heavily glycosylated gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Plant lectins bind glycoproteins through noncovalent interaction with specific hexose residues; therefore, lectins were evaluated for their ability to inactivate HIV in vitro. The mannose-specific lectins concanavalin-A and succinyl concanavalin-A completely inactivated HIV while lentil lectin, wheat germ agglutinin, and phytohemagglutinin-P substantially inactivated HIV. BS-II, Vicia villosa (hairy vetch), and Ptilota plumosa (red marine algae) failed to alter the infectibility of HIV. Neither simple stearic hindrance, viral aggregation, nor lectin-cell interactions served to explain this phenomenon. Glycoprotein glycosylation was evaluated by differential lectin binding as well as molecular weight changes in gp120 when virus was produced in the presence of swainsonine, a glycosylation inhibitor. Lentil lectin bound gp120 better than concanavalin-A, suggesting the majority of glycosylation sites are fucosylated. The apparent molecular weight of gp120 was reduced by swainsonine, although HIV infectivity and concanavalin-A inactivation were retained. Thus, at least some N-glycosylation sites are complex-type glycoproteins but regions external to the (GlcNAc)2(Man)3 \"core\" pentasaccharide region are not required for HIV infectivity. It appears that the site or sites involved are nonfucosylated, high mannose and/or biantennary, nonsialylated, N-glycosylated regions of gp120 or gp41. Alternatively, they may be in close approximation to such carbohydrate regions.\r"

  ".U": "88134687\r", 
  ".W": "We studied 66 Israeli hemophiliacs for antibodies to HIV in blood samples collected between 1978 and 1985. By May 1985, 2 had AIDS, 2 had ARC, 4 had lymphadenopathy with some immunologic dysfunction, and 58 were asymptomatic. Antibodies to HIV were detected in 40 (60.6%) patients, including all 8 with disease. Presence of HIV antibodies was significantly associated with receipt of non-heat-treated commercial factor VIII concentrates (NHT fac VIII) between 1980 and 1983. Thirty-eight of 45 (84.44%) patients treated with NHT fac VIII developed antibodies to HIV, compared to 1 of 16 (6.25%) treated with cryoprecipitates and fresh plasma only. Of 40 seropositive patients, 1 (2.5%) had antibodies by 1980, 4 (10%) by 1982, 14 (35%) by 1983, 10 (25.0%) by 1984, and 11 (27.5%) by May 1985. The decline in the rate of seroconversion can be attributed to the replacement of NHT fac VIII concentrate with heat-inactivated factor VIII (HT fac VIII) concentrate by November 1983. As of January 1984 only HT fac VIII was administered. Twenty-nine multitransfused thalassemia patients as well as 20 healthy Israeli blood donors were seronegative to HIV. All 40 (100%) seropositive hemophiliacs had antibodies to viral env gene encoded gp120/gp160 antigens. Twenty-four (60.05%) also had antibodies to viral gag gene encoded p24 and/or p55 antigens. While antibodies to gp120/160 persisted during the follow-up time, a loss of antibodies to p24/55 was observed in 5 of 16 (31.25%) seropositive patients from whom multiple samples were available. gp120/160 positive, p24/55 negative hemophiliacs had significantly lower absolute T-helper cell counts and reversed Th/Ts ratios when compared to gp120/160 p24/55 seropositive patients. Four of the 16 (25.0%) asymptomatic gp120/160 positive, p24/55 negative patients developed overt disease within 15 months of the last blood collection. The data suggest that exposure to HIV antigens is widespread among hemophiliacs in Israel, and can be attributed to receipt of NHT fac VIII concentrates prior to 1984. Antibodies to gp120/160 are of the most important diagnostic value while loss of antibodies to p24/p55 may be of prognostic value.\r"

These results support the hypothesis that atrial distension is an important stimulus to atrial natriuretic peptide release. Furthermore, the close relation between plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and clinical improvement in these patients suggests that measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration could provide a clinically useful and non-invasive method of monitoring the response to treatment.\r"

The vibration perception threshold showed appreciable individual variation both between contralateral sites and between ipsilateral sites, differing by at least 30% between the big toes in 26 (24%) of the diabetic patients and 16 (25%) of the non-diabetic group. Variability between sites was significantly greater in the diabetics than the normal subjects. The vibration perception threshold exceeded published normal values at one or more sites in 22 of the diabetic patients but at all four sites in only four. The wide variability in vibration perception threshold among sites may be due to the tissue characteristics locally and, in diabetic patients, possibly to asymmetric neuropathy. Biothesiometer readings at single or unilateral sites may be unrepresentative or misleading.\r"

  ".W": "A high prevalence of postpartum thyroid dysfunction has been reported in several countries, but there have been no systematic studies of its prevalence in Britain. Among a group of 901 consecutive, unselected pregnant women thyroid autoantibodies were detected in 117 (13%) at booking. The clinical course of postpartum thyroid dysfunction, factors associated with its development, and its likely prevalence were defined in 100 of these women with thyroid antibodies and 120 women with no such antibodies who were matched for age. None of the women had a history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Normal reference ranges for thyroid function during pregnancy and post partum were established in the 120 women negative for thyroid antibodies. On the basis of these observations postpartum thyroid dysfunction was observed in 49 (22%) of the 220 women studied, and the prevalence in the total group of 901 women was estimated to be 16.7%. Thyroid dysfunction, mainly occurring in the first six months post partum, was usually transient and included both destruction induced hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The development of the syndrome was significantly related to smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day and the presence of thyroid microsomal autoantibodies at booking. Of the 16 women with a family history of thyroid disease in whom thyroid microsomal autoantibody activity was detectable at booking, 11 developed thyroid dysfunction. Age, parity, presence of goitre at presentation, duration of breast feeding, and the sex and birth weight of the infant were not associated with the development of postpartum thyroid dysfunction. The mood changes experienced by women post partum may in part be associated with altered thyroid function during this time.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of malaria in Britain as reported to the Malaria Reference Laboratory during the past decade has increased by 51%, from 1529 to 2309 cases, and infection with Plasmodium falciparum has increased from one fifth to one third of all cases. The case fatality rate for P falciparum infections declined from 2.7% to 0.5%. Of the 67 persons who died, 54 were of British origin, nine of Asian descent, and four African. Sixteen had taken chemoprophylaxis; of these, nine had taken pyrimethamine alone. The pattern of infection shows that resident ethnic minority groups, temporary residents from west Africa, and tourists who visit Kenya are particularly at high risk. The calculated attack rates suggest that men, children, and young adults are at greater risk of malaria than women and older people. Rates are highest in immigrants who have settled in Britain who visit relatives: 316 and 331 per 100,000 for Africa and Asia respectively, 120 and 39 in tourists to those same regions, and 228 and 38 in business travellers to those regions.\r"

A recent outbreak in California was linked to the consumption of Mexican-style soft cheese and involved more than 300 cases, 30% of which were fatal. L. monocytogenes can be found in a variety of dairy products, leafy vegetables, fish and meat products. It can grow in refrigerated foods and is more heat resistant than most vegetative microbes. The epidemiologic features of listeriosis are poorly understood, and the minimum infectious dose is unknown. Those predisposed to listeriosis include immunocompromised people and pregnant women and their fetuses. Meningitis, spontaneous abortion and septicemia are the primary manifestations of the disease. Early recognition is critical for successful treatment, and ampicillin is the preferred drug. Listeriosis should be considered in any febrile patient with neurologic symptoms of unknown origin, as well as in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, premature labour or fetal death. A food source should be the prime suspect if any isolated case or outbreak occurs.\r"

Among the eight cases (19%) due to nontuberculous mycobacteria the agent most frequently isolated was M. avium-intracellulare. Five additional cases were smear-positive and culture-negative. Direct smears of node tissue or aspirate were positive for acid-fast bacilli in 7 (88%) of the 8 cases of nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis but in only 16 (46%) of the 35 cases due to M. tuberculosis. Superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis was most frequent in female North American Indian or Asian-born adults and most commonly involved the cervical nodes. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis was most frequent in female white children, and most commonly involved the submandibular nodes. The cases of both tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis were spread throughout the province. There was an urban concentration of cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis in those of Asian origin. It is important to distinguish between superficial mycobacterial lymphadenitis due to M. tuberculosis and that due to nontuberculous mycobacteria for treatment and management purposes.\r"

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether ROS also mediate hypoperfusion-induced renal injury. Renal hypoperfusion was induced in rats by suprarenal partial aortic ligation, lowering renal perfusion pressure to 20-25 mm Hg for 45 minutes. Renal MDA concentrations were measured 15 minutes after ligation release. Renal function and morphology were assessed 24 hours after hypoperfusion in control rats and in rats pretreated with antioxidant agents (allopurinol, superoxide dismutase, dimethyl-thiourea, glutathione, and catalase), a majority of which have been shown to lessen RAO-induced ARF. Hypoperfusion caused no rise in renal MDA concentrations (p = 0.54). Control ARF rats developed significant azotemia (blood urea nitrogen 119 +/- 6 mg/dl; creatinine 3.3 +/- 0.37 mg/dl) and widespread tubular necrosis by 24 hours after surgery. None of the antioxidants, administered singly or in combination, lessened the ischemic damage. Therefore, renal MDA concentrations do not rise in hypoperfusion ARF, and antioxidants do not confer protection. This indicates that previous evidence for ROS as mediators of ischemic renal injury is restricted to the RAO model of ARF, which does not closely simulate most human ischemic renal injury.\r"

To confirm this possibility, carbon monoxide (CO/O2 ratio, 0.27) and cytochrome P-450 inhibitors [4-phenylimidazole; 14-isocyano,15-(methoxymethyleneoxy)-5Z,8Z,11 Z-eicosatrienoic acid; 9-hydroxyellipticine; alpha-naphthoflavone] were tested on the isolated ductus arteriosus from mature fetal lambs equilibrated at low (4-26 mm Hg) or high (229-694 mm Hg) O2 partial pressure (PO2). Carbon monoxide completely relaxed intact vessel wall preparations and preparations consisting of only the muscle. Carbon monoxide relaxation was reversed by illumination with monochromatic light and the peak for the photoactivated contraction occurred at 450 nm. 4-Phenylimidazole (100 and 1,000 microM) was also a relaxant agent, and its action was manifest at both low and high PO2. Unlike 4-phenylimidazole, the isonitrile compound (5 microM) and 9-hydroxyellipticine (10 and 100 microM) were relaxant only at low PO2 and were also less potent. At the same PO2, alpha-naphthoflavone (10 microM) barely reduced ductal tension. Treatment of the ductus with either a combination of superoxide dismutase (60 or 150 U/ml) and catalase (40 or 1,000 U/ml) or mannitol alone (80 mM) failed to alter the steady-state tone at low PO2 and the contractile response to O2. Arachidonic acid was tested on tissues pretreated with the dual cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755C (10 microM), and produced a weak relaxation at a concentration of 1 microM or higher. 5,6-Epoxytrienoic acid relaxed the untreated tissue, and its action was abolished by indomethacin (2.8 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vehicle-treated dogs, atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 increased fractional sodium excretion from 1.8 +/- 0.6% to a peak response of 5.1 +/- 0.9% during infusion of 25 pmol/kg/min. The peptide progressively decreased mean arterial pressure from 110 +/- 5 to 94 +/- 4 mm Hg, renal vascular resistance from 0.40 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min, and arterial plasma renin activity from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 3.1 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr. When the renin-angiotensin system was blocked by 3 mg/kg i.v. enalaprilat, baseline pressure fell to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg, and subsequent infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 did not affect fractional sodium excretion. The decreases in blood pressure (from 86 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 4 mm Hg) and in renal vascular resistance (from 0.27 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min) were also ameliorated compared with the control responses. Intravenous infusion of 2.5 ng/kg/min angiotensin II restored mean arterial pressure and potentiated the natriuretic and renal vascular responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. In two additional groups of anesthetized dogs, enalaprilat did not produce the profound hypotension and did not affect the natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. When renal vascular resistance was elevated by intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II in enalaprilat-treated dogs, the natriuretic response was improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In patients, endogenous t-PA circulated predominantly as a 100 kilodalton (kDa) complex with PAI-1, as verified by immunoprecipitation. During infusions, t-PA circulated not only as free t-PA (55 kDa) but also in complexes with PAI-1 (100 kDa), alpha 2-antiplasmin (110 kDa), and C1-esterase inhibitor (170 kDa). After termination of infusions, levels of free t-PA declined, while inhibitor complexes remained prominent. Free PAI-1 activity, assayed spectrophotometrically, was markedly elevated in the 24 hr interval after infusion of t-PA in 47% of patients with infarction. The specific activity of t-PA during infusions was 0.4 IU/ng or greater. However, during the 3 hr interval after infusions in patients, specific activity declined in association with prominence of t-PA complexes, predominantly with PAI-1. Infusions of t-PA in normal rabbits did not result in reactive increases in PAI-1 activity or in the t-PA-PAI-1 complex. After infusions, t-PA was associated predominantly with alpha 2-antiplasmin and C1-esterase inhibitor rather than PAI-1. t-PA inhibitor complexes were seen despite immediate acidification of whole blood, indicating that they were present in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been shown to be an effective and safe agent for coronary thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, thrombolysis is associated with a high rate of acute reocclusion after discontinuation of rt-PA. The goals of the present study were to assess whether reocclusion after thrombolysis is caused by intracoronary platelet aggregation and to determine the role of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and serotonin (5HT) in mediating this phenomenon. Accordingly, coronary thrombosis was induced in anesthetized, open-chest dogs by insertion of a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). LAD blood flow was monitored throughout the experiment by means of a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the coil. Thrombolysis was achieved with rt-PA (0.05 mg/kg bolus + micrograms/kg/min infusion) in 23 +/- 3 min. rt-PA was then discontinued and each animal received a bolus of heparin (150 U/kg) every hour. Reperfusion was followed by repeated cycles of gradual occlusions followed by spontaneous restorations of blood flow (cyclic flow variations, CFVs) before a persistent occlusion recurred. In control dogs (n = 6), heparin alone did not prevent CFVs and reocclusion time was 25 +/- 4 min. Administration of an intravenous bolus of 0.2 +/- 0.06 mg/kg SQ29548, a TxA2/prostaglandin H2-receptor antagonist, and an intravenous bolus of 0.2 +/- 0.04 mg/kg ketanserin, a 5HT2-receptor antagonist, completely abolished CFVs in six of six dogs and reocclusion time was greater than 158 +/- 14 min (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gender (male) and the duration of the operative procedure were statistically significant factors in the development of ectopic bone, which occurred in 63% of hips. The effect of grade III EBF on THA was a limited range of movement. Both local and systemic factors seem to play a role in the development of ectopic bone.

  ".W": "To demonstrate a relationship between diarrheal incidence and the onset of hypoalbuminemia developing as a result of acute protein-calorie malnutrition and severe catabolism, we initially studied two patients who had developed severe hypoalbuminemia (less than 2.5 g/dl) and diarrhea on a variety of enteral diets. Each patient was placed on a peptide enteral formula at a rate of infusion equivalent to that used during the previous 24 h. Diarrheal volumes decreased significantly from greater than 1500 to less than 100 ml/day and from greater than 4000 to 800 ml/day. We subsequently studied 12 patients in a randomized, prospective fashion to confirm our previous observations. Seven patients received a peptide enteral formula, and five received a standard isotonic enteral formula as a control. The patients were monitored for a minimum of 2 wk or until serum albumin levels reached 3 g/dl. Nutritional variables were measured initially and every 4 days for the duration of the study. Of the patients receiving the isotonic feeding, only one of five completed the study period without diarrhea. Two patients died unrelated to the feeding, and three patients developed severe diarrhea within 48 h of institution of the study. Of the seven patients receiving the peptide feeding, six completed the study period without diarrhea. One patient had a large stool volume initially which decreased by day 2 of the study. We conclude that a peptide enteral formula is well tolerated in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia when compared to a standard isotonic enteral formula. The ability to provide enteral nutrition in a form that is well tolerated in hypoalbuminemia patients may obviate the need for parenteral nutrition routinely in these patients.\r"

Recently, the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (PetCO2) has been shown to correlate with cardiac output during CPR in experimental animals. Eighteen prehospital cardiac arrest patients were studied to determine the effect of external chest compression rate on the PetCO2 and BP in man when ventilation rate, ventilation inspiration time, applied compression force, and a 50:50 downstroke:upstroke ratio were held constant using a microprocessor-controlled CPR Thumper. Compression rate was increased from 60 to 140/min in 20 beat/min increments. The PetCO2 was 1.7 +/- 0.2% at a compression rate of 60/min and did not change significantly at increased rates. Systolic BP fell progressively from 59 +/- 5 mm Hg at 60/min to 46 +/- 4 mm Hg at 140/min. Diastolic BP remained approximately 23 mm Hg at all rates studied. Using a CPR manikin, we found that greater Thumper compression force was necessary to sustain the same sternal displacement and to achieve the same applied sternal pressure when the rate was increased due to a rate-limited fall in the compression duration.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate potential clinical applications of a newly developed, noninvasive fiberoptic conjunctival carbon dioxide (PcjCO2) sensor designed to measure continuously tissue PCO2 in a vascular bed supplied by the internal carotid artery, we studied the effects of graded respiratory and metabolic alkalosis and acidosis on PcjCO2 in a hemodynamically stable canine model. Respiratory changes were induced by varying the frequency of ventilation and metabolic changes were induced by incremental infusions of sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid. Continuous measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2) was also performed. During respiratory alkalosis and acidosis, PcjCO2 values correlated well with PaCO2 (r = 0.96, n = 106); linear regression analysis of PcjCO2 vs. PaCO2 produced a slope of 1.01 and a y-intercept of 3.94 over a PaCO2 range of 12 to 76 torr. The mean PcjCO2-PaCO2 gradient was 4 +/- 3 (SD) torr. PETCO2 values also correlated well with PaCO2 (r = 0.91), as well as with PcjCO2 values (r = 0.91). Both PcjCO2 and PETCO2 showed a much weaker correlation with PaCO2 during metabolic alkalosis and acidosis, partly because the variation in PaCO2 was less. Moreover, the PcjCO2-PaCO2 gradient increased during the metabolic portion of the study up to a mean of 10 +/- 8 (SD) torr during metabolic acidosis, implying a build-up and/or lack of washout of CO2 from the conjunctival tissues, despite the normal physiologic range of PaCO2 values. We conclude that in a hemodynamically stable canine model, PcjCO2 and PETCO2 values correlate well with PaCO2 during pure respiratory alkalosis and acidosis; the correlation weakens significantly, however, with metabolic alterations in tissue CO2 levels.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine whether measurements of pulmonary function could predict a fall in arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) with exercise. The PaO2 fell more than 3 mm Hg in 21 patients (group 1), did not change (+/- 3 mm Hg) in nine patients (group 2), and increased more than 3 mm Hg in ten patients (group 3). Group 3 had significantly less severe expiratory obstruction than groups 1 and 2. The most significant variables in predicting a change in PaO2 with exercise were the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second over the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Dsb). Measurements of FEV1/FVC of 0.50 or more and Dsb of 20 ml/min/mm Hg or more were 100 percent predictive in excluding a fall in PaO2 with exercise. Measurements below these thresholds could not be used reliably to predict which patients would develop worsening hypoxemia with exercise. Because of wide variability in reference values from eight different published studies for diffusing capacity, recommended criteria based on the percent predicted Dsb should be used with caution. We conclude that pulmonary function measurements cannot be used to predict exercise-induced hypoxemia in patients with COPD; however, the measurements may be useful in identifying patients whose condition is less severe who are unlikely to develop worsening hypoxemia with exercise.\r"

  ".W": "In seven postoperative patients with normal preoperative pulmonary function tests, we evaluated the oxygen cost of breathing (VO2resp) during continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP) and during a 15 cm H2O inspiratory pressure support ventilation (IPSV). For both periods, VO2 resp was estimated as the difference between total oxygen uptake of the period (VO2tot), measured by a mass-spectrometer system, and that during controlled ventilation. During CPAP ventilation, VO2resp was found to be 11.2 +/- 1.4 percent of VO2tot. During IPSV, VO2resp was found insignificant. It is concluded that a 15 cm H2O IPSV takes over the major part of the work of breathing in postoperative patients without preexisting pulmonary disease.\r"

In another four subjects, under constant chemoreceptor input, we determined the responses of neuromuscular output as assessed by the mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) to alteration in WI. During AMV, the inspiratory external work of breathing is partitioned between WI and ventilator work. With a constant ventilator trigger sensitivity, we calculated WI (joules/L of volume) as the difference between the area subtended by the airway pressure-inspiratory volume curves and the ordinate of the assisted breaths subtracted from that of the controlled breaths at ventilator V of 40, 60 and 80 L/min and ventilator VT of 100, 125 and 150 percent spontaneous breathing VT. At all ventilator settings, WI was less than inspiratory muscle work of spontaneous breathing (SB) and was a function of both ventilator VT and V (p less than 0.05), but ventilator V has more effect on WI. Under isocapnia and hyperoxia, we measured P0.1 and WI during AMV at ventilator VT of 125 percent of spontaneous breathing VT and ventilator V of 60, 80 and 100 L/min. End-expiratory lung volume remained constant. P0.1 during AMV was similar to that of the SB. Although WI decreased with increasing ventilator V, P0.1 did not decrease significantly. We conclude that during AMV, both ventilator V and to a less extent ventilator VT determine W. In healthy subjects changes in WI do not affect P0.1.\r"

Since the results of our original study were presented, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has created two new DRGs for patients who have respiratory principal diagnoses to help recognize the resource intensiveness associated with mechanical ventilator support. The original 95 patients' payment, which was originally calculated to be $2.2 million below costs, was recalculated to be $1.9 million below costs, representing a 13 percent reduction in the loss. We conclude that although HCFA's recent remedial action is a step in the right direction, it provides little relief from the DRG system's financial bias against long-term ventilator-dependent patients, because the new ventilator DRGs encompass only a small segment of these patients. As an alternative approach, we recommend a single DRG for patients who, regardless of their principal diagnoses, experience chronic respiratory failure requiring a minimum of three days of continuous ventilator treatment.\r"

The comparison of the 24-hr areas under the curve related to the median pH values showed that no difference existed between misoprostol and untreated patients in the first group, while ranitidine was significantly more effective (P = 0.00003) than misoprostol in the second group. The analysis of arithmetic differences between the 24-hr median pH values showed that misoprostol increased pH values by at least one unit compared to the untreated subgroup for about 3.5 hr, while the antisecretory action of ranitidine was far superior to that of misoprostol throughout the whole 24-hr period. It can be concluded that the effect of twice daily doses of misoprostol 400 micrograms on 24-hr intragastric pH is small and not at all comparable to that of the well-known potent H2 blocker ranitidine.\r"

The most potent protective agents (KT1-32, KT1-109, KT1-720, KT1-756) were investigated in detail. Drugs were administered intragastrically to fasted rats 30 min before 100% ethanol (1 ml) or acidified aspirin (10 mg/100 g), and mucosal lesions were measured planimetrically 1 hr later. Control rats receiving only ethanol had lesions involving 14.5% of the glandular mucosa. KT1-32, KT1-109, KT1-720, or KT1-756 (10 mg/100 g) reduced lesions to 0.7, 2.7, 1.8, or 0.7% of glandular stomach respectively. Aspirin-induced lesions involved 1.52% of the glandular mucosa and 10 mg/100 g of KT1-32, KT1-109, or KT1-720, or 2 mg/100 g of KT1-756 diminished the damage to 0.13, 0.02, or 0.04, or 0.00%, respectively. Indomethacin interfered with protection against ethanol by KT1-109, while the sulfhydryl alkylator N-ethylmaleimide abolished protection by both KT1-32 and KT1-109. Among the drugs investigated in detail, KT1-756 increased gastric acid output, while KT1-720 and KT1-756 significantly enhanced pepsin secretion. All four compounds studied in detail (ie, KT1-32, KT1-109, KT1-720, KT1-756) decreased the extent of vascular lesions in the gastric mucosa as revealed by monastral blue 1 min after ethanol. Thus, the mechanism of gastric mucosal protection by these novel aryl sulfhydryl compounds cannot be ascribed to an antisecretory effect, but may be related to prevention of vascular injury.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the LH secretion pattern evoked by diminution in the opioid tone produced by iv naloxone (NAL) infusion between 1100-1400 h on proestrus, the LH secretion pattern occurring spontaneously between 1430-1730 h on proestrus and the LH secretion pattern produced by exogenous LHRH administered either as a 10 ng/pulse at 20-, 30-, or 60-min intervals or infused continuously at a rate of 30 ng/h between 1200-1700 h in rats given pentobarbital at 1100 h on proestrus. Infusion of 0.5 ng NAL/h raised plasma NAL levels to 200-300 ng/ml and augmented LH secretion, as evident by increments in pulse amplitude and frequency discharge to one every 37.5 min from an average of one every 75 min in saline-infused control rats. A 4-fold increase in circulating NAL levels, produced by 2 mg/h NAL infusion, further augmented the frequency of LH episodes to 30-33 min and induced a surge-like LH secretion pattern which resembled that seen on the afternoon of proestrus. Further analysis of the secretory pattern of the preovulatory LH surge (n = 7) showed LH pulses of increased amplitude during the basal phase (n = 4), ascending phase (n = 2), and plateau and descending phases (n = 3); in two rats the LH rise was steep, and no LH pulses were identified. A LHRH pulse (10 ng/pulse) delivered at 20- or 30-min intervals or continuous infusion of LHRH at a rate of 30 ng/h produced LH surges, with peak levels reaching the range seen on the afternoon of proestrus. Further, despite the fact that 10 ng LHRH/pulse at 20-min intervals reproduced a proestrous-type LH surge, only 40% of the LHRH pulses were followed by identifiable LH pulses. Surprisingly, despite the observations that NAL evoked robust LH episodes, the basal pattern of FSH secretion in these rats was not altered. These findings show that a decrease in opioid tone on proestrus accelerates episodic LH discharge to the range that occurs after gonadectomy. A quantitative relationship between the degree of restraint on the opioid tone imposed by NAL and the magnitude of the LH response can be demonstrated. The evidence suggests that the preovulatory LH surge may occur in an episodic fashion and that it can be reproduced by LHRH delivered at a frequency rate of LH pulses seen in ovariectomized rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that TSH stimulates functional parameters in cultures of porcine follicle cells, but has no stimulatory effect on their growth. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), on the other hand, is a potent mitogen in such cells. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of EGF and TSH on the expression of proto-oncogene mRNA in porcine thyroid follicle cells. The addition of EGF caused a marked increase in the c-fos and c-myc mRNA levels. Stimulation of cells with 10 mU/ml TSH, however, failed to stimulate expression of the proto-oncogenes. The increase in c-fos mRNA caused by EGF was transient, with a maximum after 30 min. The c-myc transcript level increased after 30-60 min; the maximum level was at 90 min, and it decreased thereafter but remained at an elevated level throughout the 24 h of investigation. Half-maximal effects on proto-oncogene expression were obtained using 0.5-1 ng (c-fos) and 0.2-0.5 ng (c-myc) EGF/ml. Our data clearly demonstrate that increased expression of c-fos and c-myc mRNA is an early event in the prereplicative phase of EGF-stimulated porcine thyroid follicle cells. Since c-fos and c-myc expression may be necessary events in the prereplicative phase, the lack of effect of TSH on these functions may be closely related to its inability in stimulating the growth of porcine thyrocytes.\r"

Rat granulosa cell homogenates incubated with [19-C3H3]androstenedione generated [3H] water and [3H]formic acid in a ratio of 8-9, indicating considerable 19-hydroxylation which was not followed by aromatization. This ratio remained relatively constant regardless of the time in the estrous cycle when the ovaries were removed, although there were large differences in the extent of the reactions. Parallel incubations with [1 beta-3H]]androstenedione showed that the aromatization of [19-C3H3]androstenedione in this tissue proceeds with a negative isotope effect of approximately 3, similar to that in human placenta. Incubation of the same substrates with granulosa cell cultures produced [3H]water and [3H]formic acid in ratios of 4-5 and showed a smaller negative isotope effect in the aromatization of [19-C3H3]androstenedione. FSH stimulation of the cell cultures had no influence on the ratio of 19-hydroxylation to aromatization with respect of either the duration of stimulation or the concentration of the pituitary hormone. Incubation of the cell cultures with [1,2,6,7-3H]androstenedione yielded tritium-labeled 19-hydroxy- and 19-oxoandrostendiones and estrogens in relative quantities corresponding to those expected from the [3H]water and [3H]formic acid formation. Virtually all of the products were found in the medium, with only trace quantities located intracellularly. Similarly, incubation of granulosa cell homogenates with [14C]androstenedione yielded [14C]19-oxygenated androgens in excess of [14C] estrogens. These results indicate that rat granulosa cells effect C-19-hydroxylation of androgens greater than that linked to aromatization and that the rat ovaries produce 19-oxygenated androgens in quantities exceeding those of estrogens. The excess 19-hydroxylation is synchronous with aromatization, but it is not known whether it is catalyzed by the same or a different enzyme. The formation of 19-oxygenated androgens in cell cultures indicates that they are distinct metabolites of androgens in the rat ovary and are not merely trapped transient aromatization intermediates.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover by angiotensin II in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells has been studied in detail and shown to have a complex dependence on Ca2+. After the addition of angiotensin II, inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate increased rapidly and transiently. The transient increase was followed by a slower sustained rise, which continued for up to 30 min. Inositol phosphate accumulation during the sustained phase was decreased when experiments were performed in Ca2+-free medium. The initial transient response was not altered. Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 enhanced the angiotensin II response at 20 min, but not the 15 sec response. The sustained response, but not the transient response, was attenuated by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, indicating that the effect of Ca2+ required uptake through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Subsequent studies showed that cAMP decreased inositol phosphate accumulation at 20 min while having no effect at 15 sec. Also, incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate produced a more effective inhibition of the sustained response than of the initial transient response. However, while the transient and sustained phases of PI turnover were differently affected by Ca2+ and inhibitory compounds, the profiles of inositol phosphates generated were similar. At both 15 sec and 20 min inositol-(1,4,5) trisphosphate was detected, indicating sustained cleavage of PI-(4,5) bisphosphate. Taken together, the results suggest that while the initial PI turnover response is independent of Ca2+ and presumably initiates the rise in cytosolic Ca2+, sustained response requires entry of Ca2+ to maintain elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, while the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ may have a direct role in the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis, it is also required to sustain the PI turnover response to angiotensin II.\r"

Two experiments were performed to determine whether the rapid increase in serum FSH is responsible for the initial increase in testis weight. In the first study, the rapid increase in serum FSH levels, which normally occurs in response to photostimulation, was suppressed by twice daily injections of porcine follicular fluid, a substance known to contain the FSH-suppressing protein inhibin. Suppression of serum FSH levels during the 7 days of photostimulation resulted in an inhibition of testicular growth. In the second study, young male Djungarian hamsters housed in a short photoperiod were implanted with Alzet minipumps containing ovine (o) FSH in order to experimentally raise serum FSH levels. Another group of animals exposed to short days received minipumps containing oLH. Administration of oFSH, but not oLH, induced testicular growth comparable to that in animals transferred to a stimulatory photoperiod. Furthermore, administration of oFSH was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of porcine follicular fluid on the testes. These results suggest that the rapid increase in serum FSH after photostimulation is the primary signal for initiating testicular development in this seasonally breeding species.\r"

Twelve weeks after the ischemic insult, the testes weigh half that of control testes while there were no differences in prostate or seminal vesicle weights. Microscopic examination of the ischemic damaged testes revealed normal-appearing Leydig and Sertoli cells, but complete absence of germ cells. Assays of testicular enzyme activities indicated that lactic dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase were reduced, while alpha-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was normal, consistent with the marked reduction of germ cells. Serum androgen binding protein (rABP) levels were elevated relative to nonischemic controls. By contrast, serum concentrations of testosterone, LH, and FSH were normal. In addition, LHRH elicited identical LH and testosterone responses in control and experimental animals. Testicular blood flow measured with 133Xenon was slightly decreased in Sertoli-cell-only testes. Intratesticular temperatures was normal in all groups. These observations in rats with ischemia-induced Sertoli-cell-only testes are strikingly different from those induced by radiation or genetic defects. Animals with these latter disorders have elevated FSH levels, evidence of altered Leydig cell function as evidenced by elevated LH or abnormal response to LHRH; and normal or low serum rABP levels. We conclude that 1) ischemia produces no abnormalities of the pituitary testicular axis in spite of marked germ cell depletion and 2) Sertoli-cell-only testes of different etiologies can have varied patterns of hormone and rABP secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA), 5-(3-hydroxybenzoyl)2-thiophenesulfonamide (HTS), and compared them with the effects of acetazolamide (AZ) and ethoxzolamide (EX) on bone resorption in organ cultures in fetal rat long bones under control unstimulated conditions and in response to PTH, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D3], and interleukin-1 (IL-1). The relative potencies of HTS, EX, and AZ for inhibition of CA and bone resorption were similar. HTS inhibited control resorption at 10(-5) to 3 X 10(-5) M, while EX at 10(-4) M inhibited and AZ was ineffective. In the presence of PTH, the inhibitory effect of HTS was seen at concentrations as low as 3 X 10(-6) M and was maximal at 3 X 10(-5) M. EX was inhibitory at 10(-5) M and maximal at 10(-4) M, while AZ at 10(-4) M only partially inhibited PTH-stimulated bone resorption. The responses to PGE2 (10(-7) M), 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-9) M), and IL-1 (50 U/ml) were inhibited by HTS at 10(-5) M, while AZ at 10(-4) M was ineffective against PGE2 and 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of HTS did not appear to be due to nonspecific toxicity, since after 2 days of treatment at 3 X 10(-5) M and 3 days of recovery, the bone resorptive response to PTH was completely restored. Moreover, HTS at 3 X 10(-5) M did not inhibit the incorporation of labeled proline or thymidine into fetal rat long bones. HTS was more potent as an inhibitor when the CO2 concentration in the gas phase was reduced from 5% to 2% and the pH was increased from 7.2 to 7.5, consistent with an effect on CA-mediated hydrogen ion generation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of artificial photoperiod and temperature on testicular FSH binding and plasma FSH levels were studied in adult male Djungarian hamsters. In Exp I, hamsters were transferred to long day (LD) photoperiods (16-h light, 8-h dark) after 8 weeks of adaptation in short day (SD) photoperiods (8-h light, 16-h dark), but the ambient temperature was maintained at 25 C throughout the experiments. A marked increase in the total FSH binding per two testes occurred between 10 and 47 days after transfer to LD, a change that was accompanied by testicular growth. Binding of FSH per testicular weight decreased during the same period. Scatchard plot analyses of the parameters indicated that LD decreased both the concentration of FSH binding sites and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). Plasma FSH levels increased between 10 and 47 days after transfer to LD. In contrast, when hamsters reared under LD for 12 weeks were transferred to SD (Exp II), FSH binding per unit weight basis increased 19 weeks after transfer to SD, but the total binding per two testes decreased markedly. In Exp III, sexually mature male hamsters were subjected to different ambient temperature and photoperiods. There were no significant effects of different ambient temperatures on the testicular weight and testicular FSH binding in animals exposed for 8 weeks to either LD or SD. However, plasma FSH levels of hamsters maintained at 25 C under LD was significantly higher than FSH levels at 7 C under LD. A similar effect of temperature on plasma FSH levels was observed in hamsters under SD. The present study indicates that photoperiod is a more important environmental factor than temperature for the regulation of FSH receptor in the Djungarian hamster.\r"

  ".W": "The paracrine control of adult rat Leydig cell aromatase activity was investigated in vitro. After a 24-h preculture period of Percoll-purified Leydig cells (2.5-5 X 10(5) cells), 17 beta-estradiol synthesis reached a maximum at 5 h in the presence of exogenous testosterone (200 ng/ml) as substrate, with or without LH (100 ng/ml), and remained stable for a further 24 h. Aromatase activity was stimulated 2.5-fold by LH. The addition of seminiferous tubule culture medium (STM) from normal, neonatally hemicastrated, or prepubertally irradiated rats as well as Sertoli cell culture medium prepared from these animals enhanced both basal and LH-dependent aromatase activities during 5 h; this effect was diminished after 24 h of culture. When seminiferous tubules (200 mm) were cocultured with Leydig cells, a greater stimulation of 17 beta-estradiol production was observed compared to culture with STM. The association of Sertoli and germ cells with purified Leydig cells further enhanced aromatase activity. These results demonstrate that a Sertoli cell factor regulates Leydig cell aromatase activity. This factor is of proteic nature, thermolabile, has a mol wt ranging between 10,000-50,000, and is different from the LHRH-like substance. This compound is tissue and species specific, since it is not present in rat serum, other cell line media, or guinea pig and mouse STM. Its secretion is independent from FSH and testosterone controls. The stimulation of aromatase activity by this factor requires protein synthesis.\r"

The long term action of bFGF was manifested by the permissive effect of the molecule. bFGF had a sustained effect on RNA synthesis, and pretreatment with bFGF for 24 h altered the time course of response of the cells to rat GRF. In this cell line the cellular action of bFGF was not mediated via protein kinase-C action. bFGF was not mitogenic in 44-2C cells. bFGF stimulated uridine incorporation without affecting thymidine incorporation. Results obtained with actinomycin-D and alpha-amanitin suggest that the above effects of bFGF can be correlated with increased RNA stability produced by bFGF.\r"

The experiments were carried out in cells maintained under serum-free conditions in the absence of growth factors and hormonal supplements. We have shown that in 44-2C cells, rat hypothalamic GRF (rGRF) stimulates neurotensin, calcitonin, and somatostatin secretion. bFGF is not a mitogen in the 44-2C cells, but does regulate differentiated function by a mechanism involving regulation of RNA stabilization. The results presented here show for the first time that FGF acts as a competence factor mediating the cellular action of rGRF. In FGF-pretreated cells, 4-h exposure to rGRF stimulated RNA and protein synthesis. In this cell line rGRF was biologically active at 10(-14) M, and the ED50 for rGRF-mediated RNA and protein synthesis ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-12) M. We conclude that the interaction of FGF, acting as a permissive factor, and rGRF results in a novel mechanism of action for rGRF. These findings suggest that hypophysiotropic factors affect the cellular milieu in concert with growth factors, such as bFGF.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of arachidonic acid and arachidonic acid metabolites in the control of oxytocin secretion by ovine corpus luteum was investigated, using slices of luteal tissue incubated in vitro. Oxytocin was secreted at steady rates by luteal slices, during 60-min incubations (315.0 +/- 45.3 pg/mg.h). The secretion of oxytocin was stimulated by arachidonic acid, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and phospholipase C (PLC) in a dose-dependent manner. The highest doses of arachidonic acid, PLA2, and PLC used stimulated oxytocin secretion by 145.8 +/- 23.0% (P less than 0.01; n = 6), 331.5 +/- 42.4% (P less than 0.02; n = 4), and 955.5 +/- 278.6% (P less than 0.01; n = 4), respectively. Oxytocin secretion by luteal slices was not affected by either prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) or PGE2 over a concentration range from 3-3000 nM. Furthermore, inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism did not consistently affect arachidonic acid and PLA2-stimulated oxytocin secretion. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, which inhibits 5-lipoxygenase, however, totally abolished arachidonic acid- and reduced PLA2-stimulated oxytocin secretion. The presence of CoCl2 in the incubation medium also significantly reduced basal and PLA2- and PLC-stimulated oxytocin secretion [P less than 0.05 (n = 5), P less than 0.05 (n = 5), and P less than 0.01 (n = 6), respectively]. We have shown that oxytocin secretion from slices of ovine corpus luteum incubated in vitro is stimulated by exogenous and endogenously released arachidonic acid. The data show that PGF2 alpha and PGE2 do not have a role in luteal oxytocin secretion in vitro and PG formation does not appear to be involved in the stimulation of oxytocin secretion elicited by arachidonic acid or PLA2. Arachidonic acid may have its effect via the lipoxygenase pathway.\r"

  ".U": "88137138\r", 
  ".W": "To probe the relationship between the size of the Sertoli cell population, established during perinatal development, and production of germ cells in the adult testis, a Sertoli cell-depleted rat model was developed. This was accomplished by delivering an antimitotic drug, cytosine arabinoside (araC), directly to the testis of newborn pups. Initial studies of these araC-treated neonates indicated that 1) the drug is cleared rapidly from the testis; 2) it substantially reduces the level of Sertoli cell proliferation; 3) Sertoli cell division ceases at a normal time in spite of the previous drug treatment; and 4) araC itself has no residual effect on germ cell proliferation, which begins several days after the injection. Pups given araC were allowed to reach maturity, and their testes were perfuse-fixed for light microscopic morphometry. When the numbers of Sertoli cells in adult rats given araC as were compared with those in normal littermates, a 54% decrease in the size of the Sertoli cell population was detected in treated rats, now referred to as Sertoli cell-depleted. Moreover, when round spermatids were quantified and compared in normal and Sertoli cell-depleted adults, testes of the latter were found to contain 55% fewer round spermatids. Since, in the araC-treated group, the decrease in Sertoli cell population size was paralleled by a reduction in spermatid production of equal magnitude, the number of round spermatids per Sertoli cell was essentially identical in normal and Sertoli cell-depleted animals. Measurements of serum androgen-binding protein (ABP) and FSH in both groups indicated that the circulating level of ABP in Sertoli cell-depleted rats was approximately half, and the concentration of FSH approximately twice, that in normal animals. Thus, even though FSH is elevated in Sertoli cell-depleted rats, the production of ABP per Sertoli cell is unchanged. In addition, collective volume of Leydig cells and ventral prostate weights were normal in the Sertoli cell-depleted group, suggesting that Leydig cell function in these rats is normal. In summary, a Sertoli cell-depleted rat model has been produced by interfering specifically with Sertoli cell proliferation early in postnatal life, before onset of germ cell division. Moreover, our findings with this model indicate that production of normal numbers of germ cells in adults depends, at least in part, on the size of the Sertoli cell population. Thus, our observations identify the perinatal period, when the Sertoli cell population is established, as critical for development of quantitatively normal spermatogenesis in the adult.\r"

  ".U": "88137140\r", 
  ".W": "Using freshly isolated bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells we examined the inhibitory effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on aldosterone secretion stimulated by agonists that use either the Ca2+-phosphoinositide or cAMP messenger system. In a continuous perifusion system, angiotensin II (AII) induces a prompt initial rise in aldosterone secretion, followed by a sustained secretory response. Both phases of secretion are rapidly and independently inhibited by ANP. The role of two cyclic nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP, as mediators of this ANP-induced inhibition was examined. The effect of 8-bromo-cGMP (1-100 microM) or (Bu)2cGMP (1-50 microM) on the AII-stimulated rate of secretion was studied in a perifusion system. Either analog, whether added early or late, maximally inhibited by 20-30% only the late or sustained phase of aldosterone secretion. The effect of ANP on cellular cAMP content was examined in a static incubation system. Although ANP caused a reduction in the cAMP content of cells stimulated with either AII or ACTH, it had little or no effect on the cAMP levels in cells stimulated with carbachol. In AII- and ACTH-stimulated cells, the relationship between reduced cAMP content and reduced secretion was explored. In the AII-stimulated cell inhibited by ANP, simple restoration of cAMP content with forskolin did not restore the secretory rate. Pertussis toxin treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of ANP on cAMP content, but did not block its inhibition of secretion. In the ACTH-stimulated cell, reversal of the ANP-induced reduction of cAMP with forskolin, partially restored the stimulated rate of secretion, although restoration of cAMP with a 10-fold higher dose of ACTH did not restore the stimulated rate of secretion in the presence of ANP. These results imply that both the ANP-induced rise in cGMP and the ANP-induced decrease in cellular cAMP content may contribute to the inhibition of steroidogenesis. However, these inhibitory messages do not induce either the magnitude or the temporal pattern of inhibition induced by ANP. Thus, in the adrenal multiple messenger systems may underlie the action of ANP.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) inhibit the secretion of aldosterone by isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells stimulated by angiotensin II, ACTH, and potassium. Structure-function studies have concentrated on the significance of the C- and N-terminal chains for the biological activity of the peptide. We investigated the role of phenylalanine at positions 8 and 26 by using [Ala8]human (h) ANP or [Ala26]hANP analogs to inhibit potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion in granulosa cells. hANP-(1-28) inhibited potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion with an IC50 of 0.48 nM. Synthetic [Ala26]hANP inhibited the aldosterone response to potassium with an inhibitory curve relative to hANP-(1-28) (rIC50) of 6.0 nM, which was significantly greater than that for hANP (P less than 0.001). Synthetic [Ala8]hANP was markedly less effective as an inhibitor, with an estimated rIC50 of 3.0 microM (P less than 0.0001). To determine whether the analogs act as competitive antagonists to hANP-(1-28), experiments were performed in which a fixed concentration (0.1 microM) of the analog was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of hANP-(1-28). When hANP-(1-28) was incubated with [Ala8]hANP, the rIC50 (0.2 nM) was significantly less than that for hANP-(1-28) alone (P less than 0.02). When hANP-(1-28) was incubated with [Ala26]hANP, the rIC50 was 0.1 nM. In summary, [Ala8]hANP and [Ala26]hANP were significantly less potent than hANP-(1-28) as inhibitors of aldosterone production from granulosa cells. Both analogs shifted the hANP-(1-28) dose-response curve to the left. Neither analog functioned as a competitive antagonist to hANP-(1-28). Our results indicate that the hydrophobic phenyl groups at these two positions are required for full biological potency of ANP as an inhibitor of aldosterone production.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have been measured in eight sodium-retaining cirrhotic nonascitic rats and eight control animals before and after extracellular volume expansion by isotonic saline infusion (30 ml/kg BW, 20 min). In addition, disappearance of [125I]ANP was studied in six control and six cirrhotic rats. The effect of infusing synthetic rat ANP-(1-28) (1 microgram) on mean arterial pressure and renal function has been also studied. In basal conditions, cirrhotic rats showed higher ANP plasma levels than control animals (71.1 +/- 16.6 vs. 43.9 +/- 5.1 pg/ml; P less than 0.05). After extracellular volume expansion, ANP increased in both control and cirrhotic rats; the increase in cirrhotic was higher than that in control rats (88 +/- 27% vs. 33 +/- 8%; P less than 0.05). Disappearance of iodinated ANP from plasma was identical in control and cirrhotic rats. ANP infusion induced a larger decrease in mean arterial pressure in control (21 +/- 5%) than in cirrhotic rats (9 +/- 2.5%). ANP induced comparable increases in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in both groups of animals. However, diuretic and natriuretic effects were markedly impaired in cirrhotic animals. Thus, urinary flow increased by 91 +/- 18 microliters/min in control animals, but only by 37 +/- 7 microliters/min in cirrhotic animals. Fractional sodium excretion increased to 1.7 +/- 0.44% in controls and to 0.54 +/- 0.12% in cirrhotic rats (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that the defect in renal handling of sodium in cirrhotic rats is not due to a lack of ANP synthesis or release. In addition, these animals show an impaired renal response to ANP.\r"

  ".U": "88137147\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism underlying the GH-releasing effect of galanin (GAL), a novel 29-amino acid peptide, was investigated in the neonatal rat. The effect of galanin was compared to that of clonidine (CLO), a drug known to release GH via endogenous GHRF. GAL administration (5-25 micrograms/kg BW, sc) induced in 10-day-old pups a clear-cut and dose-related rise in plasma GH 15 min postinjection. CLO (50-450 micrograms/kg BW, sc) induced a marked rise in plasma GH, but no dose-related effect was evident. Inhibition of hypothalamic norepinephrine and epinephrine biosynthesis by DU-18288 (6 mg/kg BW, ip) or selective inhibition of epinephrine biosynthesis by SKF-64139 (50 mg/kg BW, ip) completely abolished the GH-releasing effect of GAL (25 micrograms/kg, sc), but left unaltered the GH rise induced by CLO (150 micrograms/kg, sc). Passive immunization with an anti-GHRF serum decreased basal GH levels and prevented the GH-releasing effect of either GAL or CLO, whereas in pups pretreated with an antisomatostatin serum, CLO, but not GAL, increased the already elevated plasma GH titers. In all these data indicate that in the infant rat 1) GAL is a potent GH secretagogue; 2) the action of GAL is not exerted directly on GHRF- or somatostatin-secreting structures, but requires the intervention of catecholaminergic neurons; 3) the GH-releasing effect of GAL is ultimately exerted via GHRF release, although a mechanism operating to inhibit hypothalamic somatostatin release cannot be ruled out; and 4) differently from GAL, CLO releases GH via postsynaptic stimulation of GHRF-secreting neurons.\r"

  ".U": "88137151\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "88137154\r", 
  ".W": "This study investigates the hypothesis that stimulation of ovarian progesterone (P) production by LHRH is mediated in part by arachidonic acid (AA). In rat granulosa cells prelabeled with [3H]AA or [3H]inositol, treatment with LHRH stimulates the accumulation of radiolabeled inositol phosphosphates, diacyglycerol, and unesterified AA. Treatment with AA (3 X 10(-7)-10(-5) M) enhances P production in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrent treatment with AA and LHRH (or a LHRH agonist) further stimulates P production. The stimulatory effect of AA on P production, either alone or in combination with LHRH, could be seen as early as 3 h after AA addition. Addition of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetracecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), to granulosa cells stimulates P production. Interestingly, the concomitant presence of AA and TPA further enhances production compared with either TPA or AA treatment alone. The stimulatory effect of AA on P production is completely abolished by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, but not by indomethacin. On the other hand, addition of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (but not indomethacin) reduces LHRH-stimulated P levels by about 50%. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, as well, markedly attenuates the P response due to combined treatment with LHRH and AA. Taken together, these results strongly support the notion that AA (or its lipoxygenated metabolites) partially mediates the action of LHRH. Along with the calcium and protein kinase-C pathways, AA metabolism may be involved in the biological actions of LHRH in the ovary.\r"

Follicles were then incubated for 2 h with [3H]thymidine [( 3H]Tdr) in the absence or presence of gonadotropins and with incorporation of radionuclide into DNA as the end point. FSH (25 ng) significantly stimulated [3H]Tdr incorporation in all stages of follicular development with a latency of 2 h, and this effect was inhibited by 2 micrograms unlabeled Tdr. While FSH and PRL (25 and 100 ng) stimulated [3H]Tdr incorporation in all stages, LH (0.2-5 ng) action began from stage 5 onward, when definitive thecal cells and LH receptors started appearing. LH (5 ng) also suppressed 25 ng FSH-induced DNA synthesis in stages 5-10; however, stages 1-4 were unaffected. Significant increases in both intra- and extracellular cAMP levels occurred in follicles at stages 2-10 after FSH administration. In contrast, LH was active in stages 5-10, whereas PRL was ineffective. Follicular DNA synthesis increased markedly when stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP (0.01-2 mM). These results show that gonadotropins act directly as a primary stimulus at the level of small primary and secondary follicles to regulate DNA synthesis and, thus, perhaps the growth and differentiation of granulosa and thecal cells; cAMP functions as one of the possible intracellular mediators of gonadotropin action in initiating DNA replication.\r"

Blood samples were collected from all HPD ewes on the day before and the day after HPD and on days 1 and 7 of GnRH or saline. At the end of day 7, anterior pituitary glands were removed for analysis of hormone, receptor, and mRNA content. The amount of mRNA for gonadotropins was lower (P less than 0.05) in saline-treated HPD ewes than in GnRH-treated HPD or OVX ewes. Administration of GnRH restored the amount of mRNA for FSH beta and alpha-subunits to levels similar (P greater than 0.05) to those measured in OVX ewes. The amount of mRNA for LH beta was higher (P less than 0.05) in GnRH-treated HPD ewes than in saline-treated HPD ewes, but lower (P less than 0.05) than that in OVX ewes. The pituitary content of LH and FSH was lower (P less than 0.05) in saline-treated HPD ewes than in OVX ewes. Administration of GnRH to HPD ewes maintained the ewes. Administration of GnRH to HPD ewes maintained the pituitary content of LH, but not FSH, compared to the pituitary gonadotropin content in OVX ewes. There were no differences (P greater than 0.05) in the amount of mRNA for GH or PRL or the pituitary content of these hormones among treatments. The number of hypophyseal receptors for GnRH was reduced in saline-treated HPD ewes (P less than 0.05) compared to that in OVX ewes and GnRH-treated HPD ewes. The number of hypophyseal receptors for 17 beta-estradiol was lower (P less than 0.05) in GnRH- and saline-treated HPD ewes than in OVX ewes. Serum LH concentrations were lower (P less than 0.05) after HPD than before HPD, but were restored to normal (P greater than 0.05) by GnRH replacement. Serum concentrations of FSH were lower (P less than 0.05) after HPD and were not affected by GnRH replacement. Serum PRL concentrations in all ewes were higher (P less than 0.05) after HPD than before HPD. Serum GH concentrations in all ewes were similar (P greater than 0.05) before and after HPD. Since synthesis and secretion of GH and PRL were not diminished after HPD, it was considered that the pituitary gland remained viable and functioned independently of hypothalamic input in OVX ewes after HPD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, 89 cycles from 133 combined buserelin/hMG/hCG treatment cycles (66.9%) appeared to be normal, with no evidence of premature luteinization, and 21 patients became pregnant. These data indicate that the likelihood of group II World Health Organization (WHO) patients becoming pregnant with hMG/hCG therapy may be enhanced when endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed at the same time.\r"

Ovulation returned within 14 to 38 days. Four infertile women became pregnant within 2 to 5 months after cessation of treatment. Frequent side effects were hot flushes, and decreased vaginal secretion and libido. There were no significant changes in laboratory blood tests, including cholesterol. The urinary calcium/creatinine ratio increased during the treatment. Thus, starting the treatment in the luteal phase prevented initial follicular stimulation. A better efficacy of treatment would be achieved by the release of an LH-RH agonist at a constant daily rate.\r"

However, she became refractory to this therapy and she was switched from estrogen to LA to suppress gonadotropins. The woman ovulated three times just with leuprolide therapy before any hMG was added. A possible hypothesis is that, on the way down to subnormal levels of LH and FSH, a critical level of gonadotropins was attained where they were still high enough to stimulate the follicles, but low enough to allow restoration of gonadotropin receptors, which previously had been down-regulated by the elevated gonadotropin levels.\r"

  ".W": "Primary aldosteronism is an uncommon cause of hypertension but one of particular interest because of its distinctive pathophysiological mechanism of blood pressure elevation. Aldosterone has been associated with increased Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, but there is controversy over which sodium transport parameters are responsible for this increase. We measured intracellular sodium, ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive sodium efflux, and the number of Na+,K+-ATPase sites of washed erythrocytes, as well as Na+-Li+ countertransport and the Li+-K+ cotransport rate constant of lithium-loaded red blood cells (RBCs) in six patients with primary aldosteronism and in 50 normal subjects. Ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher for the primary aldosteronism patients than for normal subjects (1.85 +/- 0.29 vs 1.51 +/- 0.21 mmol/L RBC/hr) even though the intracellular sodium concentration (7.2 +/- 1.5 vs 6.7 +/- 1.9 mM) and the number of the Na+,K+-ATPase sites per RBC (331 +/- 52 vs 385 +/- 97) were not increased. The elevated sodium efflux appeared to be due to a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in the rate constant (1.60 +/- 0.12 x 10(-15) vs 1.28 +/- 0.15 x 10(-15) mmol/site/hr) of the ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux. The rate constant decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) after treatment.\r"

Without enalapril, sodium excretion rose from 127 +/- 19 (mean +/- SE) to 437 +/- 103 mumol/min in the first 20 minutes after ANF was administered. Clearance studies performed during maximal water diuresis indicated a rise in glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium excretion. Four days of enalapril (20 mg b.i.d.) increased effective renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance) and reduced blood pressure (from 114/71 +/- 2/2 to 105/60 +/- 2/1 mm Hg). Under these conditions baseline sodium excretion was not different from the control study, but it rose less after ANF (from 117 +/- 22 to 242 +/- 63 mumol/min), and the increments in glomerular filtration rate, free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium were all blunted and nonsignificant. In addition, effective renal plasma flow tended to fall; this effect was not observed when ANF was given without enalapril. These results support the notion that the effects of ANF on renal hemodynamics and on tubular sodium handling depend on renal angiotensin II and that blood pressure reduction may interfere with the ANF-induced natriuresis.\r"

Blood pressure (BP), atrial and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), hematocrit, and renal glomerular ANF receptors were therefore studied in 1K1C rats and in their normotensive uninephrectomized controls before and after unclipping. Six hours after removal of the clip, BP was normal in the 1K1C group and plasma ANF presented a sharp decline but was still significantly higher than in the normotensive controls, with a slight difference being evident 24 hours after unclipping. Hematocrit was lower in the 1K1C rats than in their control counterparts, but this difference tended to disappear once the clip was removed, indicating a contraction of plasma volume in these unclipped 1K1C animals. The renal glomerular ANF receptor population was markedly smaller in 1K1C rats than in the uninephrectomized controls but showed a twofold increase in number and affinity 24 hours after unclipping. It is concluded that the up-regulation and enhanced affinity of glomerular ANF receptors (probably secondary to the decrease in plasma levels of ANF) may contribute to the natriuresis reported in hypertensive 1K1C animals on removal of the arterial clip.\r"

We examined the effect of three different subcellular matrices, plastic, type I collagen, and reconstituted basement membrane-like material (RBM), on the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by cultured IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts. Accumulation of 35SO4-labeled glycosaminoglycans into the cell-matrix layer or medium was measured. Cells on collagen synthesized significantly less total glycosaminoglycans than cells on plastic but had a higher fraction of labeled glycosaminoglycans present in the cell-matrix layer (35 vs. 18%) with the increases being highest for dermatan and chondroitin sulfates. Cells grown on the RBM synthesized significantly more glycosaminoglycans than cells on plastic or collagen and also had 260% more labeled glycosaminoglycans present in the cell-matrix layer than cells on plastic. We conclude that the matrix to which lung fibroblasts are exposed can influence the amount and type of glycosaminoglycans synthesized and the degree of incorporation into the matrix. This may be relevant to fibrotic lungs with increased type I collagen or to severely injured lungs in which intra-alveolar fibroblasts are in contact with denuded basement membranes.\r"

Decerebrate and paralyzed cats were ventilated with a servo-respirator which produced patterns of pulmonary inflation, assessed by tracheal pressure, which paralleled alterations in integrated activity of the phrenic nerve. Neurons with respiratory-modulated neuronal activities were recorded in the pneumotaxic region of the nucleus parabrachialis medialis and Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, as well as in the trigeminal motor nucleus. Approximately equal numbers of neurons had phasic and tonic respiratory-modulated discharge patterns. The discharge patterns of most neurons were not qualitatively altered when pulmonary inflation was prevented. However, withholding inflation did cause the recruitment of some respiratory-modulated neuronal activities. Similar findings were obtained in normocapnia and hypercapnia. Results support the concept that the discharge of neurons in the pneumotaxic region may exert phasic, as well as tonic, influences on ventilatory activity.\r"

Inhalation of bupivacaine aerosol sufficient to abolish the cough reflex to mechanical probing below the carina increased the ventilatory response to CO2 in six of seven subjects compared with saline control. This was achieved by an increase in both respiratory frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT) in four subjects, f in one subject, and VT in one subject. All subjects reported that they were more breathless on rebreathing after bupivacaine aerosol. The six subjects who recorded breathlessness with a visual analog scale (VAS) indicated its onset at a lower minute ventilation (VE) and gave higher VAS scores for equivalent levels of VE after threshold. We conclude that the enhanced CO2 sensitivity and breathlessness on rebreathing after airway anesthesia results from altered lower airway receptor discharge.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that toxic O2 radicals might be important mediators of endotoxin-induced acute respiratory failure in pigs. As a relatively specific scavenger of .OH, we infused dimethylthiourea (DMTU, 1 g/kg) before endotoxemia. Escherichia coli endotoxin (055-B5) was infused intravenously into anesthetized 10- to 14-wk-old pigs at 5 micrograms/kg the 1st h, followed by 2 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 3.5 h. During phase 1 (i.e., 0-2 h) and phase 2 (i.e., 2-4.5 h), endotoxin decreased cardiac index (CI) and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), alveolar-arterial O2 gradient (AaDo2), and hematocrit (Hct). Endotoxemia also caused leukopenia and increased the postmortem bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) albumin concentration and wet weight-to-dry weight ratio of bloodless lung. Dimethylthiourea did not significantly modify the phase 1 response. However, during phase 2, DMTU attenuated the endotoxin-induced decrease in CI and increases in Ppa, PVR, Hct, AaDo2, lung water, and BALF albumin concentration. In separate groups of endotoxin- and DMTU + endotoxin-treated pigs, lung microvascular hydrostatic pressure was increased to approximately 16 Torr (by fluid overload) to assess alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. Under these conditions, DMTU markedly attenuated the endotoxin-induced increase in alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. Under these conditions, DMTU markedly attenuated the endotoxin-induced induced increase in alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. We conclude that .OH (and possibly H2O2) significantly contributes to endotoxin-induced lung injury in anesthetized pigs.\r"

  ".W": "Airway anesthesia with aerosolized lidocaine has been associated with an increase in minute ventilation (VE) during CO2 inhalation. The increase in VE may be due to increased neuromuscular output or decreased mechanical load on breathing. To evaluate this we measured VE, breathing pattern, mouth occlusion pressure, and lung mechanics in 20 normal subjects during room-air breathing and then inhalation of 6% CO2-94% O2, before and after airway anesthesia. Measurements of lung mechanics included whole-lung resistance, dynamic and static compliance, and functional residual capacity. Airway anesthesia had no detectable effect on any measurements during room-air breathing. During CO2 inhalation, airway anesthesia produced increases in VE and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) and more negative inspiratory pleural pressure but had no detectable effect on lung mechanics or mouth occlusion pressure. Pleural pressure was more negative during the latter 25% of inspiration. We concluded that airway receptors accessible to airway anesthesia play a role in determining neuromuscular output during CO2 inhalation.\r"

Our experimental work, plus the clinical studies of others, suggests that the gut can serve as a reservoir for systemic infections caused by bacteria that cross (translocate) the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. Bacterial translocation from the GI tract does not normally occur in the healthy animal owing to (1) the presence of an indigenous GI microflora preventing bacterial overgrowth, (2) an intact intestinal epithelial barrier, and (3) normal host immune defenses. However, a thermal injury, as well as other stressors, can result in the disruption or impairment of any of these protective mechanisms, potentially leading to lethal systemic infections with bacteria colonizing the gut.\r"

  ".U": "88139765\r", 
  ".W": "Receptor-mediated regulation of prolactin synthesis by 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) in the pituitary cell strain GH4C1 is dependent on the concentration of extracellular calcium. We have now investigated the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cytosolic free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) in these cells using the fluorescent indicator quin2. Basal resting [Ca2+]i was unchanged in cells treated with 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 either acutely (from 0 to 15 min) or for periods of up to 48 h. However, the initial peak of the biphasic change in [Ca2+]i induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was enhanced more than twofold in cells pretreated for 24 or 48 h with 1,25(OH)2D3. This 1,25(OH)2D3-enhanced calcium response was restricted to the initial phase of TRH action; the secondary plateau phase was unaffected. Neither the affinity nor number of TRH receptors nor the early time course of [3H]MeTRH binding to GH4C1 cells were affected by pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. Because TRH binding was not altered, four sites along the intracellular signal transduction pathway of TRH action were examined. Neither protein kinase C activation nor inositol polyphosphate accumulation were enhanced in response to TRH, in 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells, indicating that phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was unchanged by pretreatment. A low concentration of ionomycin was used to probe the size of the nonmitochondrial intracellular calcium pool that is sensitive to TRH. Ionomycin was not able to mobilize more calcium from 1,25(OH)2D3 pretreated cells, indicating that TRH-responsive intracellular calcium stores were probably not enhanced by pretreatment. Chelation of extracellular calcium, however, did eliminate enhancement of the TRH response in 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated cells. We conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates acute dynamic changes in [Ca2+]i induced by TRH without affecting basal [Ca2+]i. The mechanism of the enhanced response of 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated cells to TRH appears to depend upon a postreceptor event independent of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis that involves increased calcium conductance at the level of the plasma membrane. A less likely explanation involves enhancement of intracellular calcium stores in an ionomycin-resistant, EGTA-sensitive, TRH-mobilizable reservoir.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments were designed to characterize the kinetics of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism as a function of time in hepatocytes obtained from rats infused continuously for 30 h with a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin (ET). Chronic endotoxemia greatly reduces the ability of hepatocytes to utilize [1-14C]AA, which is reflected from the earliest times of incubation in very low labeling of intermediates in the biosynthetic pathways of glycerolipids (phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol) and slower removal of [1-14C]AA from the free fatty acid pool as compared with saline-infused rats. At later times of incubation, the labeling of phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol [PI]), but not of triacylglycerides is decreased. Analysis of fatty acid composition of individual phospholipids from cells of ET-infused rats reveals that the content of AA is significantly reduced only in PI. Hence an impairment in activation/acylation enzymatic mechanisms could affect the turnover of metabolically active phospholipid pools, i.e., PI, involved in signal transmission processes, and result in increased availability of 20:4 for eicosanoid synthesis, contributing to cellular metabolic perturbations in endotoxicosis.\r"

Production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin, was also stimulated. No stimulation was found with native LDL, which was minimally incorporated by the cells. Acetylated LDL and beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL), though incorporated more efficiently than oxidized LDL, also had no stimulatory effect. When oxidized LDL was separated into the lipoprotein-lipid peroxide complex and free lipid peroxides, most of the stimulatory activity was found in the former fraction, indicating that stimulation of arachidonate metabolism in the cell is associated with uptake of the lipoprotein-lipid peroxide complex. These results suggest that peroxidative modification of LDL could contribute to the progression of atheroma by stimulating arachidonate metabolism during incorporation into macrophages.\r"

Both tissue-type and urokinase-type PA production was enhanced. Studies using metabolic inhibitors indicated that both RNA and protein syntheses are required for the sulfonylurea-mediated stimulation of PA release. In addition to continuous release of the two PAs, there was also a continuous release of a single PAI, which did not show an increase after the sulfonylureas. These results suggest that, in addition to their beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, some sulfonylurea compounds may also have significant thrombolytic effects. These results also suggest that pharmacological enhancement of PA production by vascular endothelial cells may be a promising antithrombotic mechanism.\r"

Oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited by antimycin A, and glycolysis was regulated by graded glucose deprivation to achieve stepwise ATP depletion. Over a range of ATP levels down to approximately equal to 5% of normal, over 5 h, cells were altered only minimally, or injured reversibly. Such cells maintained mitochondrial potential, and retained more K+ than cells without an energy source. Over the same duration, cells without an energy source were lethally injured. Treatment with antimycin induced increments of triglycerides and decreases of phospholipids. With severe ATP depletion (approximately equal to 5-10% of normal after 5 h), decrease of phospholipids was marked. Cells in which ATP was not measurable (or was less than 5% of normal) showed comparable phospholipid declines but, in addition, showed massive and progressive increase of unesterified fatty acids. The results identified a low threshold of ATP, at best 5-10% of normal, which preserved viability in LLC-PK1 cells despite major loss of membrane phospholipids. This threshold also determined the ability of cells to maintain their normally low levels of unesterified fatty acids. Failure of energy-dependent mechanisms that normally metabolize unesterified fatty acids may be a correlate of the extent of energy depletion that determines lethal injury.\r"

All five TCLs tested were CD2+, CD4+, CD8-, and were strongly proliferative only to S. japonicum egg antigen in the absence of exogenous IL-2. All but one TCL produced IL-2-like lymphokines in vitro, indicating their helper T cell functions. One TCL, SjE-3, failed to produce IL-2-like lymphokines. Moreover, this TCL suppressed the specific proliferation of autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes to S. japonicum egg antigen. This TCL produced a soluble suppressor factor(s). These functional diversities among established TCLs were also confirmed by cloned T cells. Our observations might suggest that the regulatory system through helper and suppressor T-T interactions somehow involved in T cell responses to the egg antigen in human chronic schistosomiasis japonica.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and/or pro-urokinase (pro-UK) induced lysis of standard 125I-fibrin clots suspended in plasma was studied. Doses were kept below the concentration at which a nonspecific effect was seen, i.e., where fibrinogenolysis and major plasminogen consumption were observed. Small amounts of t-PA potentiated clot lysis by pro-UK by attenuating the lag phase characteristic of pro-UK, and causing a much earlier transition to the rapid phase of lysis. Similar promotion of the fibrinolytic effect of pro-UK was obtained when clots were pretreated with UK or with a little plasmin (less than 1% clot lysis). Promotion by plasmin was nullified by a subsequent treatment of the clot with carboxypeptidase B, indicating that the plasmin effect was related to the exposure of carboxy terminal lysine residues on fibrin. These lysine termini, absent in undegraded fibrin, are known to be essential for the high affinity binding of plasminogen to fibrin. In contrast, clot lysis by t-PA was unaffected by plasmin pretreatment and little affected by carboxypeptidase B treatment of the fibrin substrate. Therefore, plasminogen bound to lysine termini on fibrin, although found to be essential for pro-UK, did not appear to serve as a substrate for t-PA. Selective activation of fibrin bound plasminogen has been attributed to the conformational change in Glu-plasminogen that occurs as a result of binding. The present findings suggest that this conformational change occurs when plasminogen is bound to a terminal lysine but not to an internal lysine. Plasminogen bound to the latter site on fibrin was activated by t-PA and therefore is involved in the ternary complex. This initiates lysis of the undegraded clot and exposes the plasminogen binding sites required by pro-UK. By their complementary activation of fibrin bound plasminogen, t-PA followed by pro-UK induces efficient and synergistic fibrinolysis, whereas each is relatively inefficient when used alone.\r"

Pharmacologic doses of the mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) resulted in a 28% increase of Na-K-ATPase activity. Furosemide-induced inhibition of sodium uptake by the mTALH cell also resulted in Na-K-ATPase activity reduction (45%). Sodium deprivation did not cause a clear change in enzyme activity, either at 3 d or 2 wk, likely reflecting the result of the opposing influences of decreased sodium delivery and increased endogenous aldosterone. Finally, the behavior of Na-K-ATPase activity at 3 d of sodium deprivation in the mTALH contrasted with a 60% increase in activity observed in the cortical collecting tubule, a nephron segment known to be responsive to mineralocorticoid, and this heterogeneity of response may suggest an important role for the mTALH in maintaining salt homeostasis.\r"

Because general anesthesia and acute surgical trauma may perturb baseline coronary hemodynamics and alter responses to experimental interventions, this study examined the effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide (arginine-102-tyrosine-126) and rat atriopeptin II (serine-103-arginine-125) on the coronary circulation of unsedated, awake dogs. Studies were performed in 12 chronically instrumented animals in which a surgically implanted electromagnetic flow probe and intracoronary catheter allowed measurement of left circumflex coronary blood flow during intraarterial administration of the atrial natriuretic peptides. Bolus doses of both human atrial natriuretic peptide and rat atriopeptin II produced dose-dependent coronary vasodilation; the threshold for coronary vasodilation was 0.2 micrograms/kg body weight for both agents. Coronary vasodilation produced by human atrial natriuretic peptide was not antagonized by adenosine receptor blockade or by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin. Thus, atrial natriuretic peptides produced dose-dependent coronary vasodilation in intact awake dogs that was not dependent on adenosine-mediated or prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Substances structurally and functionally similar to digitalis glycosides are produced by several vertebrate species. There also is evidence for a digitalis-like substance of human origin. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to study the direct effects on the cellular electrophysiology of canine Purkinje fibers of 1) bufalin, an unconjugated cardiotonic steroid molecule that is produced by the toad Bufo marinus, and 2) an extract of human bile that showed digitalis-like immunoreactivity on radioimmunoassay. The goal of this study was to determine whether these substances have arrhythmogenic effects comparable with those seen with toxic doses of digitalis glycosides. Bufalin, 2 x 10(-8) M, significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced maximal diastolic potential, action potential amplitude and duration and maximal rate of rise of phase 0 (Vmax) within 40 min of onset of exposure. All six fibers developed delayed afterdepolarizations and two developed triggered rhythms. Ouabain was less potent, in that a 2 x 10(-7) M concentration was required to comparably reduce maximal diastolic potential, action potential amplitude and duration and Vmax within 30 min. These Purkinje fibers also developed delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered rhythms. A sample of an extract of human bile that showed digitalis-like immunoreactivity with an antibufalin serum also reduced maximal diastolic potential, action potential amplitude and duration and Vmax, and produced delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In contrast, immunologically unreactive bile extracts had no appreciable effect on the action potential. In summary, the cardiac toxicity of digitalis substances produced by lower vertebrates is comparable with that induced by the glycosides. Moreover, it appears that humans may produce digitalis-like substances that may be cardiotoxic.\r"

  ".U": "88140262\r", 
  ".W": "Down-regulation of the development of CTL has been studied in mice both in vivo and in vitro. To generate CTL to hapten-altered self Ag in vivo, an immunization protocol has been used in which the host's Th cells are stimulated by a minor locus histocompatibility Ag (Mlsd) and its precursor CTL are activated by trinitrophenylated syngeneic spleen cells. Injecting the H-2 compatible Mls-disparate spleen cells along with the TNP-coupled self cells into the hind paws causes TNP-self specific CTL to appear in popliteal lymph nodes within 5 days. We have previously reported that inducing Ts cells by i.v. injecting Mlsd-bearing cells prevents in vivo generation of TNP-self specific CTL after immunization in this way. Here the induced Ts cell as well as the mechanism by which it functions have been further examined. The suppression was seen to extend to allogeneic as well as TNP-self Ag, provided the Mlsd-tolerized animal was reexposed to Mlsd-bearing cells at the time of immunization for CTL. By transferring the Mlsd-induced suppression adoptively we have learned that the splenic suppressor cell bears Thy-1.2 as well as Lyt-1.1 Ag and inhibits the generation of CTL at the afferent limb. In addition, Mlsd-induced PEC of Mlsd-tolerized mice, but not of normal mice, mediated suppression of development of CTL in vivo. The active cells within the tolerized PEC have been identified as T cells and macrophages (M phi). Furthermore, PEC from mice tolerized to Mlsd suppressed generation of CTL directed toward TNP-self targets in vitro. T cells and M phi separated from PEC of Mlsd-tolerized mice achieved suppression best in culture when present together. In addition, Lyt-1+ splenic cells from tolerized but not normal mice cooperated to down-regulate CTL generation in vitro with peritoneal M phi from either tolerized or normal mice. Supernatants of 24- to 72-h cultures of PEC from tolerized mice were suppressive of CTL generation when incorporated at 40 to 50% of culture volume. Supernatants of T cells from tolerized PEC or spleen were suppressive in culture only when M phi from normal mice were also present. To achieve suppression dialyzed supernatants of M phi from tolerized mice could replace the M phi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether IFN-gamma has a similar isotype regulatory role in vivo, we studied the abilities of rIFN-gamma and a mAb to IFN-gamma to modify the isotypes of Ig secreted in mice injected with a goat antibody to mouse IgD, which by itself induces large increases in levels of serum IgG1 and IgE and a relatively small increase in serum IgG2a. Multiple injections of IFN-gamma substantially inhibited production of IgG1 and IgE, and stimulated production of IgG2a in affinity purified goat antibody specific for mouse IgD-treated mice; anti-IFN-gamma antibody blocked the effects of IFN-gamma and in fact enhanced IgG1 and IgE secretion and inhibited the IgG2a response in these mice. The role of IFN-gamma in the selection of isotypes of Ig produced in response to injection of mice with the bacterium Brucella abortus (BA) was also studied, because killed, fixed BA are known to stimulate IFN secretion and a predominantly IgG2a antibody response. Anti-IFN-gamma antibody strongly suppressed IgG2a secretion and stimulated IgG1, but not IgE, secretion in BA-immunized mice. BA suppressed IgG1 and IgE secretion and enhanced IgG2a secretion in affinity purified goat antibody specific for mouse IgD-injected mice; treatment of these mice with anti-IFN-gamma antibody reversed the effects of BA on IgG1 and IgG2a secretion, but not the suppressive effect of BA on IgE secretion. These observations demonstrate that IFN-gamma has an important and perhaps unique physiologic role in the stimulation of IgG2a secretion and in the suppression of secretion of IgG1, whereas bacterial antigens can suppress IgE secretion by other mechanisms in addition to IFN-gamma secretion.\r"

The vast majority of these cells lack the conventional TCR-alpha-, beta complex but express the recently identified TCR-gamma, delta/CD3 receptor complex. These TCR gamma+/CD3+ cells were initially discovered by using as a criterion the lack of reactivity with WT31 mAb. This mAb has been reported to recognize a \"framework\" epitope on the TCR-alpha, beta/CD3 complex. However, using high concentrations of WT31 mAb, low levels of reactivity with the cell membrane of TCR-gamma+ cells can be observed. This reactivity was significantly increased upon removal of sialic acid residues by neuraminidase. In addition, WT31 mAb is capable to induce lysis by TCR-gamma+ clones. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with WT31 by using cell lysates prepared with the mild detergent digitonin resulted in the isolation of the intact TCR-gamma/CD3 complex. Thus, in contrast to what was previously assumed, WT31 mAb also reacts with a functional epitope present on gamma, delta/CD3 T cells, and therefore lack of reactivity with WT31 mAb is not always a proper hallmark for TCR-gamma-expressing cells.\r"

Mice given streptozotocin and IFN-gamma were significantly more hyperglycemic than those given streptozotocin alone and had significantly decreased body weight. Mice given IFN-gamma alone did not differ in glycemia or weight from vehicle-injected mice. On day 11, Ia proteins were detected on islet cells from mice given streptozotocin and their expression was potentiated by IFN-gamma; they could not be detected on islet cells from mice given IFN-gamma alone or vehicle. H-2K protein expression was increased on islet cells from mice given streptozotocin and was potentiated by IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma alone also increased H-2K protein expression on islet cells compared with vehicle-treated mice. These findings show that IFN-gamma enhances the severity of diabetes in mice given multiple-low doses of streptozotocin, in association with enhanced expression of Ia and H-2K proteins on islet cells. They indicate an important role for IFN-gamma in amplifying the autoimmune process leading to beta-cell destruction in diabetes. The ability of IFN-gamma to worsen autoimmune disease has implications for its use in man.\r"

In an effort to understand the mechanism of this suppression, we measured the production of immune IFN-gamma, which may be required for the induction of an immune response, by EAE effector T cells (which transfer disease) and EAE suppressor cells when cultured in vitro with MBP. We now report that EAE effector T cells produce IFN-gamma when cultured in vitro with MBP. In contrast, spleen cells from recovered rats (which manifest suppressor activity in vivo) do not produce IFN-gamma. Moreover, in cell mixing experiments, these suppressor spleen cells inhibited the production of IFN-gamma by EAE effector cells. This inhibition was not eliminated by the removal of macrophages nor by the inhibition of PG synthesis by indomethacin. Furthermore, the inhibition was shown to be Ag-specific and mediated by nylon-adherent, radiation-sensitive splenic T cells. The findings suggest that suppressor cells regulate EAE by inhibiting IFN-gamma production by effector cells. This inhibition may result in the down-regulation of IFN-gamma-induced expression of class II major histocompatibility Ag on cells of the central nervous system, thus reducing the presentation of tissue-specific Ag (i.e., MBP) to autoreactive lymphocytes.\r"

Further, a significant inverse correlation was observed between serum sIL-2R levels and CD4 cell levels in seropositive study participants. These findings suggest that increased serum sIL-2R levels in HIV infection may be linked to CD4 cell loss, and thus reflective of the stage of HIV-induced disease.\r"

No obligate role for IFN-gamma was found. First, CTL activation in the presence of high dose cyclosporin A was partially reconstituted with IL-2, although no detectable IFN-gamma was produced in such cultures. In addition, IFN-gamma could not reconstitute cyclosporin-inhibited cultures. Second, inclusion of a high concentration of several distinct anti-IFN-gamma antibodies failed to inhibit MLR cultures. Third, CTL activation by stimulator cells inactivated by UV irradiation was reconstituted by IL-2, but not by IFN-gamma. These data do not support an autocrine role of IFN-gamma in CTL activation and confirm the importance of IL-2 in the primary murine MLR.\r"

These actions of rIL-5 on a homogeneous cloned line (BCL1-CL-3 cells) allow us to identify and characterize the two alternated B cell developmental pathways. One is an IL-2-independent, IL-5-driven differentiation pathway without preceding up-regulated IL-2R expression, and the other is an IL-5 plus IL-2-dependent augmented differentiation pathway with preceding up-regulated IL-2R expression. We have also demonstrated the functional difference of two distinct B cell growth-promoting factors, B cell-stimulating factor 1 (rIL-4) and rIL-5. CL-3 cells are equally stimulated to grow by rIL-4 and rIL-5, whereas only rIL-5 can render CL-3 cells responsive to rIL-2, indicating that these two lymphokines affect B cells in a strikingly different manner.\r"

To characterize the relationships among these proteins, ELISA and immunoblotting studies were undertaken with rabbit antisera raised against three synthetic PrP peptides. All three antisera were found to specifically react with the prion proteins, and failed to identify other lower or higher m.w. PrP proteins.

To solubilize the protein, peptococci were treated with different proteolytic enzymes (papain, pepsin, and trypsin) or with mutanolysin, a bacteriolytic agent known to digest the cell walls of streptococci. Papain, trypsin, and mutanolysin all solubilized peptides showing affinity for radiolabeled human IgG in Western blot analysis. Compared with papain and trypsin, mutanolysin liberated a more homogeneous material, which also had a higher m.w. This mutanolysin-solubilized protein (Mr 95 kDa) was obtained highly purified by a single isolation step on IgG-Sepharose, and the molecule was found to exhibit unique Ig-binding properties. Thus, in dot blots and in Western blots, human IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab fragments of IgG, and human kappa and lambda L chains all showed affinity for the protein. Moreover, the molecule also bound human IgM and IgA, whereas no binding was recorded for IgG-Fc fragments or IgG H chains. Finally, the protein bound to human polyclonal Ig L chains immobilized on polyacrylamide beads. These different data demonstrate that the isolated peptococcal protein binds Ig through L chain interaction. The name protein L is therefore suggested for this novel Ig-binding bacterial cell wall protein.\r"

  ".W": "Many mAb that bind the carbohydrate antigenic determinant 3-fucosyl-lactosamine (3-FL), Gal beta 1-4[Fuc alpha-3]GlcNAc-R have been raised in BALB/c mice, and we are studying the structure and regulation of these antibodies. In this report, we present the first information about their amino acid sequences and the Ig gene segments used to encode them. V regions of the H and L chains of three anti-3-FL antibodies, PMN6, PMN29, and PM81, were sequenced by a combination of mRNA and amino acid sequencing. The L chain sequences of PMN6 and PM81 antibodies indicate that their VK and JK regions are encoded by VK24B and JK1 germ-line genes, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the H chains suggest that the three anti-3-FL antibodies are encoded by the VH441 gene segment of the X24 VH family, and this conclusion was supported by Southern filter hybridization with VH441 and JH3-JH4 probes. PMN29 has at least 11 amino acid substitutions, which is an unusually large amount of somatic mutation for an IgM antibody. Previous analyses of BALB/c genomic libraries with VHX24 and VH441 probes make it unlikely that this VH family contains additional germ-line genes, but this possibility cannot be excluded. All three antibodies use the DQ52 and JH4 gene segments. The single VH and VL gene segments used to encode the anti-3-FL antibodies is in contrast to the multiple VH and VL segments used by antibodies against other carbohydrate Ag such as alpha 1-6 dextran and group A streptococcal carbohydrate. VH441 also encodes the VH regions of antibodies against galactan and levan (beta 2-6 fructosan). The similarities among VH segments of antibodies against 3-FL, levan, and galactan, and the striking differences in their CDR3 sequences, suggest that CDR3 plays an important role in the formation of the Ag binding site. The use of a single VH segment from the smallest VH gene family by antibodies against at least three different carbohydrate determinants is noteworthy. It raises the possibility that the amino acid sequence encoded by VH441 has some general structural features that make it particularly well adapted for binding to carbohydrate sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a 22-kDa exotoxin produced by most Staphylococcus aureus strains responsible for toxic shock syndrome. TSST-1 is a mitogen for human T cells. The mechanism of T cell activation by TSST-1 was investigated. TSST-1 induced IL-2R expression, IL-2 synthesis, and proliferation in T cells in a monocyte-dependent fashion. Neither IL-1 nor IL-2, alone or in combination, substituted for monocytes in supporting TSST-1-induced mitogenesis. We investigated the mechanism by which TSST-1 induces initogenesis. TSST-1 failed to induce ADP-ribosylation of T cell membrane proteins. However, the toxin induced transient translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membranes and also induced the mobilization of cellular Ca2+ stores in both PBMC and the Jurkat human tumor T cell line, suggesting that TSST-1 triggered inositol phospholipid turnover. This was directly demonstrated to be the case in both cellular preparations studied. TSST-1 induced the increased synthesis of the inositol phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl inositol-4 phosphate, and phosphoinositol inositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and induced the breakdown of inositol phospholipid as evidence by the accumulation of phosphatidic acid and inositol phosphates. We conclude that the action of TSST-1 involves the induction of inositol phospholipid turnover, protein kinase C activation, and mobilization of cellular Ca2+ stores. This effect is similar to that of mitogenic lectins and of anti-CD3 antibodies.\r"

We found that both drugs inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the activation of cytotoxicity induced by IFN-beta, suggesting the requirement for intact PK-C activity in this process. In contrast, neither H-7 nor retinal inhibited the activation of cytotoxic M phi by IFN-gamma, indicating that IFN-gamma acts through a PK-C-independent pathway. The effectiveness of both drugs in inhibiting PK-C in intact M phi was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of induction of c-fos mRNA by L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol, a process that has been shown to be dependent on PK-C activation. We have found a strict correlation in the dose-dependent inhibition by both drugs of c-fos mRNA induction and activation of M phi by IFN-beta. These results indicate that different pathways of activation are triggered by IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, the former being independent from and the latter dependent on intact PK-C activity.\r"

Stimulated infected T cells also express the cell surface activation Ag 4F2, transferrin R, and HLA-DR. The secretion of IFN-gamma by infected T cells in response to PHA is not suppressed at 24 to 72 h after stimulation. Total RNA synthesis at 48 and 72 h after stimulation is reduced in infected T lymphocytes. Infectious measles virus progeny are produced during this interval. Thus infected T lymphocytes can become activated in response to mitogenic stimuli and the cells support efficient viral replication before the block in cell proliferation.\r"

Fourteen anti-alprenolol hybridomas utilize 10 different combinations of six Vk, one V lambda, eight VH, three JK, one J lambda, and three JH genes. In addition to the combinatorial association, somatic mutations and junctional variation of assembled genes further contribute to diversity of the anti-alprenolol response. Although differing both in length and structure, the five H-chain third complementarity-determining region analyzed contain several acidic residues. Neither V gene utilization, nor H-chain third complementarity-determining-region structure can be simply correlated with affinity of the antibodies for the ligand. The anti-alprenolol V genes were compared with the corresponding sequences of unrelated antibodies. Antibody 37A4 shares a VH gene with anti-(Glu60Ala30Tyr10)n random terpolymer and anti-nitrophenyl antibodies, and a Vk gene with two anti-oxazolone antibodies. Antibodies 14C3 and 17C1 use the same germ-line VH and Vk genes as do anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies of the (Glu60Ala30Tyr10) system.

In order to study the interaction of transacting factors with sequences of the kappa gene responsible for their activation, altered kappa genes could be introduced into 70Z/3 cells and their induction patterns studied. As a preliminary step to such studies, we show that wild-type kappa genes stably integrated into 70Z/3 cells can be expressed normally and that their pattern of induction by LPS and IFN-gamma is indistinguishable from wild-type 70Z/3 cells. By using electroporation, gamma genes were co-transfected with either the neo or gpt selectable genes. In all cases, the expression of the kappa genes was autonomous, reflecting neither regulation by the selected markers nor by flanking chromosome sequences. A noninducible variant of 70Z/3, NN12, also increased mRNA levels from transfected kappa genes in response to LPS and IFN-gamma, suggesting that its defect is in its endogenous kappa gene. These results demonstrated the usefulness of this approach for distinguishing between variants that have structural defects in their endogenous kappa gene from variants that have defects in transacting factors or other steps in the induction pathways.\r"

All B lymphoblastoid cell lines contained rearranged Ig H and kappa L chain genes, secreted Ig, and expressed B and not T cell surface markers. Cell lines with rearranged TCR beta-genes had rearranged both IgH genes and had rearranged and subsequently deleted both kappa C region genes. Furthermore all three B lymphoblastoid cell lines with rearranged TCR beta-genes produced small amounts of Ig with lambda-L chains. Although the cellular mechanisms maintaining lineage-specific rearrangement events remain unknown, extensive Ig gene rearrangement and inefficient Ig production by B cells may be indicators of a cellular status where normally stringent lineage-specific control elements fail to function efficiently.\r"

  ".W": "The role of autochthonous IFN- production was evaluated in immune reactions to Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV)-induced tumors which are characterized by spontaneous regression mainly caused by virus-specific CTL activity. A functional IFN- depletion, induced by repeated administration of mAb anti-IFN- at the site of virus inoculation, prevented tumor regression in M-MSV-injected mice. Moreover, this antibody inhibited in vitro both proliferation and differentiation of M-MSV-specific T lymphocytes obtained in bulk cultures, but not growth and lytic activity of the already differentiated virus-specific CTL clone CHM-14 stimulated with rIL-2 and relevant tumor Ag. In addition, in mice receiving mAb treatment the frequency of M-MSV-specific CTL precursors, evaluated by means of limiting dilution analysis, was strongly reduced in comparison with that of control mice injected only with virus. Because CTL secrete IFN- following antigenic stimulation, the possibility that non-T effector cells recruited by this lymphokine might mediate tumor regression was also considered. Adoptive immunotherapy experiments, performed in T cell-deficient (Tx + BM) and in sublethally irradiated mice, demonstrated that transfer of CHM-14 CTL clone, which secretes IFN-, was able to counteract M-MSV tumor growth despite the local mAb anti-IFN- treatment which may have prevented host cell recruitment. Moreover, repeated local rIFN- inoculations in Tx + BM mice did not counteract M-MSV tumor progression, thus confirming that other IFN- properties such as non-T cell recruitment, antiviral or anti-proliferative IFN- activities have little or no relevance when M-MSV-specific CTL are lacking. On the whole, these results indicate that in M-MSV-injected mice, tumor enhancement after mAb anti-IFN- treatment is principally caused by impaired differentiation of virus-specific CTL precursors.\r"

Both the peak plasma concentration of praziquantel and the bioavailability (measured as the area under the plasma concentration time curve) were significantly greater in the two groups of patients with liver disease (P less than .005), as were the concentrations of the two identified metabolites of praziquantel. Mild side effects were associated with high peak concentrations of praziquantel, but a syndrome of severe abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhea was not. Our results indicate that the side effects and bioavailability of praziquantel are increased in the presence of liver disease.\r"

Despite having less parasite-specific serum antibody, the infection-free (\"putatively immune\") individuals showed greater lymphocyte responsiveness, especially interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, to O. volvulus antigen (OVA) than did the infected subjects; lymphocyte responses (including IL-2 production) to mitogens and nonparasite antigen in both study groups were equivalent and normal.

  ".U": "88140589\r", 
  ".W": "Copper is unique among cations in that its balance is regulated by the liver. The liver regulates copper balance by excretion of copper (we call it regulatory copper) in the bile destined for loss in the stool. However, most copper secreted into the gastrointestinal tract, for example, that in saliva and gastric juice, is reabsorbed. The biochemical mechanism by which the normal liver \"packages\" regulatory copper to prevent its reabsorption is not understood. Whatever the mechanism, it appears to have failed in Wilson's disease, because patients with Wilson's disease do not excrete adequate amounts of regulatory copper in their bile to prevent copper accumulation. In the present work, we have studied cholecystokinin-stimulated biliary secretions obtained by intestinal intubation of five normal subjects and five patients with Wilson's disease. Studies of these secretions reveal: (1) that normal but not Wilson's disease biliary samples had a copper-containing peak in the void volume from Sephadex G-75 columns; (2) that the amount of copper in this peak extrapolated to 24 hours of secretion was appropriate to maintain normal copper balance; (3) that the amount of copper in this peak increased with dietary copper supplementation of normal subjects; (4) that normal but not Wilson's disease biliary samples cross-reacted with each of two ceruloplasmin antibodies; and (5) that the high molecular weight Sephadex G-75 fraction from normal but not from Wilson's disease biliary samples cross-reacted with ceruloplasmin antibody. We postulate that the high molecular weight copper-containing substance observed with Sephadex chromatography in normal biliary samples but absent in Wilson's disease samples is the copper-packaging mechanism for copper balance regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two weeks after injection of adjuvant, the rats developed significant (P less than or equal to 0.01) swelling of the noninjected paw indicative of systemic inflammation. The rats with AA also exhibited signs of the acute phase response, as measured by a significant increase in plasma C-reactive protein (138% above normal) and a significant decrease in plasma albumin (47% below normal), zinc (30% below normal), and iron (58% below normal). IL-1 production from spleen cells of rats with AA was increased 115% compared with normals. Results from immunofluorescence studies with W3/25 and OX8 antibodies to distinguish rat T-helper-inducer (TH) spleen cells from suppressor-cytotoxic (nonhelper T) spleen cells indicated no significant difference between the percentage of OX8+ cells in spleens of arthritic rats compared with OX8+ cells in spleens of normal rats. The W3/25+-to-OX8+ ratio of 1.6 +/- 0.2 for normal rat spleen cells (33% to 21%) was not significantly different from the arthritic rat ratio of 1.9 +/- 0.1 (36% to 19%). When the phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed, the normal animals possessed a greater percentage of W3/25+(TH) cells than did rats with AA. Normal blood mononuclear cell samples were composed of 51% +/- 3% W3/25+ cells and 22% +/- 2% OX8+ cells, and the samples from rats with AA contained 43% +/- 4% W3/25+ cells and 24% +/- 3% OX8+ cells. Thus, the helper-to-nonhelper ratio was higher for normal rats (2.3 +/- 0.1) than for arthritic rats (1.8 +/- 0.2). The data indicated that the appearance of the acute phase response and the abnormally high rate of splenic IL-1 production in the rats with AA did not stem from a subnormal percentage of OX8+ nonhelper T cells in the spleen or peripheral blood.\r"

In 11 of the patients cerebral arteriovenous oxygen differences were measured simultaneously. In all patients the effects of pronounced hyperventilation were recorded prior to initiation of barbiturate treatment. A normal CBF response to hyperventilation (delta CBF/delta PaCO2 greater than or equal to 1) was obtained in eight patients. In these patients induction of barbiturate coma was accompanied by physiological decreases in CBF and in the calculated cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2); they also exhibited a rapid and lasting decrease in ICP. A decreased or an abolished CO2 reactivity was recorded (delta CBF/delta PaCO2 less than 1) in 11 patients. In 10 of these 11 patients the physiological decreases in CBF and CMRO2 were not obtained during barbiturate treatment and the decrease in ICP was transitory.

The inhibitory activity was able to be purified by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography and gel filtration, had a molecular weight of approximately 40,000, and was relatively heat stable. Such metalloproteinase inhibitory activity was also present in conditioned media of human myofibroblast primary cultures obtained from cirrhotic liver explants but absent in conditioned media of primary normal liver explants. Purified fractions of the metalloproteinase inhibitor activity obtained from both myofibroblast conditioned media and extracts of cirrhotic liver blocked invasion but not attachment of MCF-7 cells on human amnion in vitro. The results further support the role of myofibroblasts in inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis and provide one possible mechanism by which cirrhotic livers resist metastasis.\r"

At a concentration of GSH less than 10(-5) M, microsomes produced more PGI2 and PGF2 alpha than PGE2. At a greater GSH concentration, PGE2 synthesis was remarkably enhanced. On the other hand, PGI2 and PGF2 alpha synthesis was inhibited. In the presence of 10(-3) M GSH, ten times more PGE2 was produced than the other PGs. The concentration of GSH in porcine bladder epithelium was about 0.6 mM. This reciprocal effect of GSH was also observed in rabbit and bovine bladder epithelium. These findings suggest that GSH is involved in the regulation of PG synthesis in urinary bladder epithelium. GSH may influence the physiological and pathophysiological changes elicited by PGs in the lower urinary tract.\r"

Flutamide significantly increased LH pulse frequency in all patients (p less than 0.05 by Wilcoxon's test). The FSH pulse analysis disclosed a similar pattern of LH. Plasma IC-T clearly increased following flutamide therapy; mean IC-T values were 2.67 +/- 0.47 ng./ml. and 4.67 +/- 0.62 ng./ml. before and after flutamide administration, respectively (p less than 0.05 by paired Student's t test). Our study demonstrates that flutamide acts in humans as a selective and specific antiandrogen compound.\r"

As most injuries occurred following rapid deceleration impact against stationary bases, quick-release (breakaway) bases were evaluated as a means to modify this mechanism of injury. Six hundred thirty-three softball games were played on breakaway-base fields and 627 games were played on stationary-base fields. Forty-five sliding injuries (7%) occurred on the stationary-base diamonds and only two sliding injuries (less than 1%) occurred on the breakaway-base fields. Implementing the use of breakaway bases in recreational softball leagues could potentially achieve a significant, cost-effective reduction of injuries.\r"

  ".U": "88141558\r", 
  ".W": "An automated method of chemiluminescence analysis of nitrogen used routinely for 4 yr. Liquid samples (urine, enteral, and parenteral feeds) required simple dilution, whereas feces required a modified acid-digestion procedure, before analysis. For urine samples, the coefficient of variation was within batch from 0.9-3.6%, and between batch 4.3-7.6%. At a sample injection rate of 2 microliter/sec, the useful dynamic range, for urine diluted 1:200, was 0-14 g N/liter. Precision for fecal nitrogen analysis was 3.8-6.7% for samples of low to high nitrogen content. The correlation between this technique and an established Kjeldahl method for fecal analysis was studied (r = 0.96, slope = 1.30). The discrepancy between the methods was due to inefficient conversion of nitrogen to NH4+ during Kjeldahl digestion of feces, rather than systematic errors in chemiluminescence analysis. Reliability was as good as for other automated clinical analyzers and sample cost was ca. 0.22 pounds. It has proved possible to analyze approximately 80 samples in the working day. The efficiency of measuring 24-hr urine urea-nitrogen (UUN) and total urine nitrogen (TUN) in patients on general wards was measured. Results were obtained on 87% of TPN days, but large variations were noted in UUN/TUN from less than 30% to greater than 90% (average 75.7%) in patients receiving TPN, and from less than 55% to 100% (average 83.8%) in patients receiving enteral nutrition. In contrast, UUN/TUN was 87.0% and 84.0% in healthy subjects, fasted or receiving iv nutrition, respectively. We therefore expect that clinical nutritionists will find increasing applications for this method of nitrogen analysis.\r"

All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.\r"

To clarify the requirements of carnitine after injury, we studied carnitine elimination (in 10 critically ill injured patients) both during fasting and early parenteral nutrition. Increased carnitine (mainly, free) output after injury (9.36 +/- 1.63 mumol/kg p less than 0.02 vs reference) was negatively related to nitrogen balance (p less than 0.05) and positively to 3-methyl-histidine output (p less than 0.01), acting as a market of body mass catabolism. The output of both total and free carnitine progressively decreased (p less than 0.01) throughout the course of total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, our data definitively suggest that carnitine loss after injury reflects body cell mass wastage and does not necessarily mean an increased need.\r"

The infants were entered into one of three experimental groups based on birth weight: group I less than 1.0 kg; group II 1.0-1.51 kg; and group III 1.52-2.5 kg. Throughout the study subjects were placed on appropriate nutritional regimes which included hyperalimentation (HA), intravenous (iv) fat emulsion (Intralipid), Portagen, Enfamil-24 Premature Formula, Enfamil-20, and breastmilk. Blood samples were drawn from each infant at birth, days 1-5,7 then weekly, also before and after each nutritional intervention to determine carnitine and triglyceride concentrations. Results showed that plasma total carnitine and nonesterified carnitine decreased in all groups when the infants were maintained on a carnitine-free diet (HA, Intralipid, Portagen). In general, the carnitine levels continued to decrease until a carnitine-containing diet was initiated. Once a carnitine-containing diet was begun, plasma total carnitine (TC) and nonesterified carnitine (NEC) levels increased at fairly similar rates in all groups. However, an inverse relationship between carnitine and triglyceride (TG) concentrations were not seen in these infants. This would indicate that most premature infants require exogenous carnitine to maintain the plasma concentration of carnitine. However, a decreased concentration of plasma carnitine was not correlated with an elevated TG level under the conditions of this study.\r"

Analyses of major life-threatening complications indicated that those who had a complicated postoperative course (17 patients) had a significantly lower TBK (p less than .05, Fisher's exact test). Using linear discriminant analysis (SPSS computer program), correct prediction of postoperative death or survival was possible in 85% of patients if measured by TBK alone, and in 83% if weight loss and serum albumin were used. Seventy three percent were correctly classified as complicated or uncomplicated by TBK alone, but serum albumin and weight loss were not helpful in predicting patients with complications. This study shows that malnutrition and operative risk may be identified preoperatively in patients with malignant hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease. Objective improvement may be achieved by intensive nutritional support.\r"

As control, animals with liver damage received total parenteral nutrition with glucose and amino acids only. The serum GOT and GPT concentrations were significantly lower in the group supplemented with nucleoside-nucleotide mixture than those in other groups. A large dose (1.2 g/kg) of uridine inhibited liver injury, but a lower dose (0.14 g/kg) did not have any effect, whereas nucleoside-nucleotide mixture containing the same amount of uridine inhibited the injury. Liver cell extract also did not improve liver function. Thus infusion of a physiological and balanced mixture of nucleosides or nucleotides may improve liver function in rats with liver injury.\r"

Despite the absence of apolipoproteins, the metabolism of artificial lipid particles is similar to that of chylomicrons which contain various kinds of apolipoprotein. Of the known apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein C-II (apo C-II) is important in the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via involvement in the activation of lipoprotein lipase. Modifications of apo C-II associated with intravenous infusion of a lipid emulsion were investigated in eight patients. Changes in apo C-IIs in high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) together with the plasma level of triglycerides, were quantified before and for 90 min after a bolus injection of a 10% lipid emulsion (1 ml/kg of body weight). Immediately prior to the injection, 54% of the total amount of apo C-II was present in HDL, while 27% was present in VLDL. After 5 to 10 min, the amount of apo C-II in HDL decreased to 29% of the total, while that in VLDL increased to 62%. Subsequently, the amounts of apo C-II in HDL and VLDL began to return to the preinjection levels. These variations in apo C-II were closely correlated with the plasma clearance of triglyceride. The result indicates that the injected lipids are not inert particles during their short intravascular life, but that they acquire apo C-II from HDL.\r"

Rats subjected to this program maintained similar body weight, nitrogen balance, plasma chemistries, and liver tests in comparison to control animals fed per os in isocaloric and isonitrogenous amounts. Efficiency of peritoneal absorption for both glucose and amino acid was 95%. Histological examination of intraabdominal organs revealed only mild inflammation. This model is applicable to studies involving nutritional support via the peritoneal cavity, a technique which may be of value in patients with sensitive fluid balances (cardiac, renal, or pulmonary failure).\r"

During a 3-hr lipid infusion, serum triglycerides reached a steady state with both emulsions in the healthy controls, whereas, in diabetic patients, steady state triglyceride levels were seen only with MCT/LCT. After the end of the lipid infusion, the longest half-life value in the decline of triglyceride levels was found with LCT in diabetics, whereas significantly shorter and quite similar half-life values were found with LCT in healthy controls and with MCT/LCT in diabetics. As expected, the shortest half-life for serum triglycerides was found in healthy controls after MCT/LCT-infusion. Virtually the same differences in serum concentrations and in half-life times were seen with free fatty acids. According to these data, if needed, parenteral nutrition with lipids in states of disturbed glucose and lipid metabolism may preferentially be done with MCT/LCT emulsions.\r"

This study describes the measurements on 21 patients with colorectal cancer while fasting and with incremental levels of standard TPN-glucose system by central vein. Following an overnight fast, the measured mean +/- SEM percent difference from the predicted RME for the male group was 4.13 +/- 1.67% and the female group, 2.09 +/- 2.09%. The overall mean percent difference of 2.95 +/- 1.45 suggests that colorectal cancer does not cause an increase in energy expenditure. Hepatic metastases in 11 of the patients did not influence RME. The data from the 21 patients indicate a statistically significant increase in RME with TPN compared to postabsorptive states in females of 37%, in males 21.88%, and combined of 29.88%. Progressively greater increases in RME were seen when calories provided incrementally exceeded the basal RME. Carbohydrate loading in excess of the patient's calorie need, as indicated by the respiratory quotient (RQ) greater than 1.0, results in fat synthesis and other energy-costing processes. The basal RME demonstrates that these cancer patients are not hypercatabolic, but do respond to high-level force-feeding with markedly increased metabolic expenditures.\r"

Organic analysis was conducted by thin layer chromatography with cholesterol, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and sphingomyelin as standards. Silicone, calcium, and phosphorus and three organic compounds, which could not be conclusively identified, were found. The precipitate was most likely calcium phosphate intermixed with silicone oil lubricant and residual total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution. This formed in the catheter at body temperature probably due to incomplete catheter flushing.\r"

The swivel requires very little torque for rotation, ie, one-fourth that of the standard swivel, yet is 1/30 as expensive. A coil spring tube, located between the swivel and the catheter, allows the rat unhampered movement within the metabolic cage. Because the catheter follows the rats' movements freely, only two silk sutures are required to secure it to the animal. No statistically significant differences between experimental and control rats were observed in terms of body weight gain, food intake, nitrogen balance, or caloric efficiency. This apparatus should prove useful in many areas of research.\r"

  ".W": "Between April 1984 and July 1986, 14 patients underwent heart-lung transplantation at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, England. The donors for the first five operations were brought to our hospital and the organs removed in the operating theater adjacent to that in which the recipients were prepared. Subsequently, organs have been procured from distant centers. The total ischemic time ranged from 48 to 51 minutes (mean 49.6) for the near procurement group and from 70 to 186 minutes (mean 123.6) for the distant procurement group. Our method of preservation consists of cold cardioplegic arrest of the heart with St. Thomas' Hospital solution followed by a single cold (4 degrees C) pulmonary artery flush with a solution containing 500 ml donors blood, 700 ml Ringer's solution, 200 ml 20% salt-poor albumin, 100 ml 20% mannitol, 20 micrograms prostacyclin, and 10,000 units heparin. Function of the lungs after implantation was assessed by measuring the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. The median alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient measured shortly after discontinuation of bypass (point 1), just before extubation (point 2), and at 1 week (point 3) were 96.0, 62.3, and 18.8 mm Hg, respectively, for the near procurement group and 91.5, 60.0, and 11.3 mm Hg, respectively, for the distant procurement group. Comparison of the two groups at the three measurement points by the nonparametric Wilcoxon test showed no significant difference (p = 0.44, 0.52, and 0.11, respectively). The two groups showed significant decline of the alveolar arterial oxygen gradient differences over the first week (p = 0.004, nonparametric Friedman test). We conclude that our method of preservation provides a satisfactory function after implantation. The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient differences were high immediately after implantation but decreased significantly afterward.\r"

Many treatment modalities, including vermilionectomy, have been used to destroy or remove the damaged epithelium. A new procedure for the treatment of actinic cheilitis is the use of the carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. This simple and quick method can be performed on an outpatient basis with use of local anesthesia. It is associated with remarkably low morbidity, especially in comparison with vermilionectomy, because vaporization is limited to diseased tissue, the mucosal epithelium, and very superficial dermis. The cosmetic results of CO2 laser treatment of actinic cheilitis are excellent.\r"

Synthetic agonist benzodiazepines promote GABA-ergic neurotransmission, and hence the hypnotic and anxiolytic effects of this class of drugs, by binding to these sites. A normal physiological role for these binding sites is unknown, and an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors has not been definitely identified in normal animals. In animals and human beings with hepatic encephalopathy, however, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have induced amelioration of the encephalopathy, and an endogenous substance that competitively binds to benzodiazepine receptors has been found in cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest that an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor with agonist properties contributes to hepatic encephalopathy by promoting GABA-ergic neurotransmission.\r"

Therefore, hemilaryngectomy and other forms of vertical partial laryngectomy have been used mainly for rescue therapy following radiation failure. Over a 9-year period selective application of this approach was used in eight patients out of 122 laryngeal cancer surgeries performed. Five patients were T1N0 and three were T2N0 at the time of initial diagnosis and at the time of recurrence. Three patients had healing problems postoperatively. Tracheal decannulation time was increased compared to patients who had hemilaryngectomy without previous radiotherapy. To date there has been no recurrence of carcinoma at any site with a mean follow-up of 58 months in surviving patients. This experience confirms reports which indicate that with careful selection, radiation failures for early glottic carcinoma can be rescued by hemilaryngectomy achieving excellent tumor control and moderately good preservation of laryngeal function.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively measured the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration during 13 episodes of cardiac arrest in 10 critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation, to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator of circulatory status during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration decreased from a mean (+/- SD) of 1.4 +/- 0.9 to 0.4 +/- 0.4 percent after the onset of cardiac arrest. During precordial compression, it increased to 1.0 +/- 0.5 percent. The decreases in the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration were associated with increases in systemic oxygen extraction (r = 0.79). Spontaneous circulation was restored on seven occasions. This was heralded by a rapid increase in the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, from 1.3 +/- 0.5 percent to an overshoot value of 3.7 +/- 2.1 percent, within approximately 30 seconds. The concentration then declined to a stable value of 2.4 +/- 1.8 percent four minutes after resuscitation. However, it remained 0.7 +/- 0.4 percent in six patients in whom resuscitative efforts failed to restore spontaneous circulation. These observations are consistent with experimental studies of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pigs, in which the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration varied directly with the cardiac output produced by precordial compression. We therefore propose that measurement of the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration may be a practical, non-invasive method for monitoring blood flow generated by precordial compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an almost immediate indicator of successful resuscitation.\r"

  ".U": "88143025\r", 
  ".W": "To improve criteria for entry into future trials of immunosuppression, we enrolled 40 children with recent-onset Type I insulin-dependent diabetes in a pilot trial of cyclosporine. Twenty-seven patients were able to discontinue insulin therapy 48 +/- 5 days after the start of immunosuppression. At four months, their fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations averaged 110 and 160 mg per deciliter (6.1 and 8.9 mmol per liter) with a mean hemoglobin A1c level of 6.15 percent. Seventy-five percent of these patients with early remission still did not need insulin at 12 months, and their glycemic control was similar to that at 4 months. The major differences between the 27 patients with remission and the 13 without remission were the duration of symptoms before diagnosis (26.8 vs. 48.0 days, P less than 0.01), the degree of weight loss (3.2 vs. 10 percent of body weight, P less than 0.001), the initial hemoglobin A1c level (10.7 vs. 13.2 percent, P less than 0.001), and the frequency of ketoacidosis (11 vs. 61.5 percent, P less than 0.001). The lesser degree of weight loss was the strongest independent predictor of remission. The response of C-peptide to intravenous glucagon (0.50 vs. 0.17 pmol per milliliter, P less than 0.05) was also an independent predictor. No differences were observed between the two groups of patients in age, sex, HLA phenotype, autoantibodies to insulin or islet-cell antigens, or doses or trough levels of cyclosporine. Only minimal manifestations of toxicity were detected over the period of observation. We conclude that early treatment with cyclosporine in children with recent-onset Type I diabetes can induce remission from insulin dependence, with half the patients not requiring insulin after a full year.\r"

  ".W": "The biological requirement of the trace element selenium was recognized 40 years ago. Selenium is incorporated into several enzymes and transfer RNA species of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. In enzymes which contain a selenopolypeptide, selenium is present as covalently bound selenocysteine which participates in the catalytic reaction. Sequence analysis of the genes coding for two selenoproteins, formate dehydrogenase H from Escherichia coli and glutathione peroxidase from mouse and man, demonstrated that an in-frame UGA opal nonsense codon directs the incorporation of selenocysteine. In the case of formate dehydrogenase incorporation occurs cotranslationally. Recently, we identified four genes whose products are required for selenocysteine incorporation in E. coli. We report here that one of these genes codes for a tRNA species with unique properties. It possesses an anticodon complementary to UGA and deviates in several positions from sequences, until now, considered invariant in all tRNA species. This tRNA is aminoacylated with L-serine by the seryl-tRNA ligase which also charges cognate tRNASer. Selenocysteine, therefore, is synthesized from a serine residue bound to a natural suppressor tRNA which recognizes UGA.\r"

Four animals were euthanatized at 30 minutes, one at 36 hours and three from 18 to 21 days after the treatment. Nitrous oxide (N2O) cryotherapy also was applied in a double freeze-thaw fashion to three of the eyes to compare the effects of the CO2 laser and cryotherapy at each of the time intervals. Epithelial destruction was achieved with CO2 laser power levels of 5.0 W and one or more superimposed burns. At 5.0 W, Bowman's membrane was destroyed while the conjunctival substantia propria protected the underlying sclera. The anterior chamber reaction was minimal and appeared to be less intense than with cryotherapy after 36 hours. At high energy levels (20.0 W), corneal and scleral perforation occurred. Furthermore, we have treated five human patients with the CO2 laser for bulbar conjunctival epithelial proliferative disorders. Minimal scarring occurred and local control of the disease was obtained in four patients. The CO2 laser may offer advantages over other modalities of treatment for bulbar conjunctival epithelial disorders. Its use is not recommended for lesions of the cornea and forniceal or palpebral conjunctiva.\r"

  ".W": "Several of the common viral agents that can cause hepatitis have been detected in body fluids, including saliva and blood, which may both form important routes for transmission of disease. The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections. The potential hazards are discussed in relation to those associated with HBV and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), implicated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

Freshly extracted teeth were fixed in formalin and subsequently hemisected longitudinally through the midline. One half was prepared for ground sections and the other half for decalcified sections. Neither gross nor microscopic abnormalities were present in enamel of patients with HVDRR. The concentration of calcium and phosphorus and the calcium/phosphorus ratio of the enamel of patients with HVDRR were nearly equal to those of normal teeth, although the degree of radiopacity was less in HVDRR. On the other hand, numerous microscopic abnormalities in the dentin of patients with HVDRR were found, such as interglobular dentin, wide predentin zones, and tubular defects. The concentration of phosphorus in the dentin of a patient with familial HVDRR was extremely low. Furthermore, formation of reparative dentin was observed at the pulp horn of teeth in patients with HVDRR that had been subjected to definite attrition at the corresponding dentin site.\r"

S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 412-420]. Crystallinity was demonstrated by x-ray diffraction. Microcrystals (tetragonal prisms, 0.02 mm in the largest dimension) were obtained in high yield with retention of activity and contained Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mg in approximate atom ratios of 1.0:1.25:0.5:0.5, respectively. Analysis of the amino acid residues and the tightly bound detergent support an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa, of which 150 kDa is protein (1316 +/- 66 amino acids) and 50 kDa is detergent (Brij 35). Seven major polypeptides are evident by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Adjustments in buffer concentration and other conditions have yielded much larger green crystals, hexagonal bipyramids; a crystal 0.3 X 0.5 X 0.7 mm gave x-ray diffractions as high as 8-A resolution and a space group of P6(2) or P6(4), and cell dimensions of a = b = 174.5 A, c = 282.2 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees, and gamma = 120 degrees were obtained. A reasonable value of 3.1 A3/Da for Vm, the average space per dalton of protein in the crystal, was obtained for the asymmetric unit, which contains four irons and is a dimer of two minimal catalytic units. Cylindrical dimers (80 X 100 A) estimated from two-dimensional electron diffraction studies [Fuller, S. D., Capaldi, R. A. & Henderson, R. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 134, 305-327] pack well in the crystal lattice with the symmetry of the space group of the crystal. The crystallization procedure developed is useful in purification of the enzyme and shows promise for the production of crystals of sufficiently high order to gain improved structural information from x-ray diffraction.\r"

The gene, designated GPA1, encodes a protein (GP1 alpha) of 472 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 54,075. Here we report the isolation of another G-protein-homologous gene, GPA2, which encodes an amino acid sequence of 449 amino acid residues with a Mr of 50,516. The predicted primary structure of the GPA2-encoded protein (GP2 alpha) is homologous to mammalian G proteins [inhibitory and stimulatory G proteins (Gi and Gs, respectively), a G protein of unknown function (Go), and transducins (Gt)] as well as yeast GP1 alpha. When aligned with the alpha subunit of Gi (Gi alpha) to obtain maximal homology, GP2 alpha was found to contain a stretch of 83 additional amino acid residues near the NH2 terminus. The gene was mapped in chromosome V, close to the centromere. Haploid cells carrying a disrupted GPA2 gene are viable. Cells carrying a high copy number of plasmid GPA2 (YEpGPA2) had markedly elevated levels of cAMP and could suppress a temperature-sensitive mutation of RAS2. These results suggest that GPA2 may be involved in the regulation of cAMP levels in S. cerevisiae.\r"

A synthetic random polymer of serine and arginine (1:3) is readily phosphorylated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C but not by protein kinase P. Although the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylated serine (threonine) residue have been demonstrated in studies with small synthetic polypeptides to be decisive factors in the rate at which they are phosphorylated, the findings with the large synthetic polypeptides suggest that in the case of proteins the size, the tertiary structure, and particularly the electrostatic interactions are equally or more important contributing factors. Syringomycin, a toxin from Pseudomonas syringae, and polymyxin B, from Bacillus polymyxa, stimulate protein kinase P, strongly inhibit protein kinase C, and have no effect on protein kinase A. Basic polypeptides with high lysine content are phosphorylated by ATP nonenzymatically.\r"

This enzyme is the site of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have isolated a 2.7-kilobase complementary DNA (cDNA) encompassing the entire coding region of prostaglandin G/H synthase from sheep vesicular glands. This cDNA, cloned from a lambda gt 10 library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of vesicular glands, hybridizes with a single 2.75-kilobase mRNA species. The cDNA clone was selected using oligonucleotide probes modeled from amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme. The full-length cDNA encodes a protein of 600 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 24 amino acids. Identification of the cDNA as coding for prostaglandin G/H synthase is based on comparison of amino acid sequences of seven peptides comprising 103 amino acids with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA. The molecular weight of the unglycosylated enzyme lacking the signal peptide is 65,621. The synthase is a glycoprotein, and there are three potential sites for N-glycosylation, two of them in the amino-terminal half of the molecule. The serine reported to be acetylated by aspirin is at position 530, near the carboxyl terminus. There is no significant similarity between the sequence of the synthase and that of any other protein in amino acid or nucleotide sequence libraries, and a heme binding site(s) is not apparent from the amino acid sequence. The availability of a full-length cDNA clone coding for prostaglandin G/H synthase should facilitate studies of the regulation of expression of this enzyme and the structural features important for catalysis and for interaction with anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

When analyzed for activity by transient transfection into lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, a single copy of the NF-kappa B binding site could act as a tissue-specific upstream activating element. Two copies (dimer) showed 10-fold higher activity than did one copy and could act as an enhancer element 2.5 kilobases downstream of the transcriptional start site. The enhancer activity of this sequence was correlated with the presence of the cognate binding protein, NF-kappa B. This sequence acted as an inducible enhancer under conditions that induce NF-kappa B binding activity. Thus, the NF-kappa B binding site acts by itself as a tissue-specific and inducible enhancer element, and two copies show cooperative interaction.\r"

Two thirds of the clones transformed with tsA58 and ras became arrested in G2 or late S phase when shifted to a nonpermissive temperature for T antigen stability. Thus, ras induced growth arrest rather than stable transformation in the absence of a functional collaborating oncogene.

Based upon time of degradation of YPs during embryogenesis, existence of maternally stored ecdysteroid conjugates in embryos, location of these conjugates in locust embryos, and the fact that free active ecdysteroid hormones are released at a specific time in embryogenesis to trigger cuticle deposition, we postulate that the similarity reflects a common property of Drosophila YPs--the ability to bind the fatty acid ecdysteroid conjugates. Our finding of conjugated ecdysteroids tightly bound to purified Drosophila YP supports this prediction.\r"

Comparison of the nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences of goldfish and other vertebrate VH genes indicates that goldfish VH genes show the major VH gene regulatory and structural features (5'-putative promoter region, split hydrophobic leader, three framework and two complementarity-determining regions, and 3'-recombination signals for VH to diversity region joining) and that goldfish VH genes are not more closely related to one another than they are to VH genes of evolutionarily distant vertebrates such as the mammals. Goldfish VH genes appear to exist in distinct families, and individual goldfish can carry from none to apparently greater than 15 genes of a given family. These results suggest that whereas the basic structure of VH genes has been conserved in evolution, there may be substantial variation in the nature and population distribution of VH gene families in the vertebrates.\r"

The gene encoding the gamma 2b chain is created by a rearrangement of the mu gene. This rearrangement always takes place within a homolog. In cells with a gamma 2b gene, most of the time the gene segment encoding the constant region of the mu chain is deleted, but often the rearrangement leads to cells that produce no immunoglobulin, and all DNA sequences are retained. The latter result is due to an inversion. Inversions exclude the unequal sister chromatid exchange model of the heavy-chain class switch. Looping out is an intermediate step in the process of generating an inversion. Our findings demonstrate that the switch rearrangement occurs by looping out and deletion.\r"

Transfectants were selected in medium containing hygromycin B. HRAS-transformed FE-8 cells showed an increased sensitivity toward ouabain when compared to their normal counterparts. Therefore, the population of transfected hygromycin B-resistant cells was treated with ouabain to eliminate cells with a transformed phenotype. Ouabain selection resulted in a small number of cell clones exhibiting a more normal phenotype. The clones had lost the morphology of transformed cells and required anchorage for growth. The tumorigenicity of transfectants in nude mice was reduced but not completely abolished. FE-8 revertants continued to express the p21 RAS protein. Human repetitive sequences contained in the DNA of a secondary transfectant were used for isolation of the suppressor gene from reverted FE-8 cells. The cloned DNA fragment was transfected into tumorigenic FE-8 cells and conferred a partial reversion of the transformed phenotype.\r"

Therefore, we investigated the effect of the administration of IL-1 on the survival of lethally infected granulocytopenic mice. Mice with cyclophosphamide-induced granulocytopenia were injected with approximately 10(7) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the thigh muscle at time 0; gentamicin was administered 6 hr and 23 hr later. When recombinant human IL-1 beta (one of the two forms of IL-1) was given as a single i.p. injection 24 hr before the infection, survival was increased. Using 80 ng of IL-1 beta per mouse, survival compared to control animals was 98% vs. 71% at 24 hr, 98% vs. 60% at 30 hr, 86% vs. 36% at 36 hr, and 61% vs. 11% at 48 hr (P less than 0.001) after the infection. No effect of IL-1 was observed when it was given 0.5 hr before or 6 hr after the infection. Animals not treated with gentamicin also benefited from the IL-1. Administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect the activity of IL-1. Numbers of bacteria cultured from the blood, thigh muscle, liver, spleen, and kidney were similar in IL-1-treated and control animals. Superoxide production by peritoneal macrophages was also similar in the two groups. These studies demonstrate that IL-1 pretreatment protects granulocytopenic mice against lethal pseudomonas infection and suggest that this protection occurs through a noncellular mechanism.\r"

Previous in vivo studies suggested that triiodothyronine might facilitate aldosterone-induced stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase. Results show that when segments of cortical collecting tubules microdissected from collagenase-treated kidneys of adrenalectomized rats were incubated for 3 hr in the presence of either 10(-8) M aldosterone or 10(-8) M triiodothyronine alone Na+,K+-ATPase activity was not altered, whereas the addition of both hormones markedly stimulated the activity and the number of catalytic sites of Na+,K+-ATPase. This stimulation was abolished by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, whereas it was not altered in the absence of extracellular sodium or in the presence of the luminal Na+-channel blocker amiloride. Thus, triiodothyronine facilitates the in vitro induction of Na+,K+-ATPase synthesis by aldosterone. Aldosterone action on Na+,K+-ATPase is independent of Na+ availability.\r"

A combination of starch gel electrophoresis of seven cytoplasmic enzymes and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of two outer membrane proteins was used to resolve the clonal population structure of these bacteria. Fifty electrophoretic types were assigned to 21 clones on the basis of a cluster analysis. The clones were separated into four distinct serogroup A subgroups, all of which were isolated from cases as recently as 1983. Most epidemics or outbreaks were characterized by their association with a single or predominant clone, although some epidemics were apparently of mixed etiology and others yielded rare isolates belonging to other clones. Seven predominant clones were recognized that have caused sets of epidemics since 1915. At least two of these sets can be considered to represent mutually exclusive pandemics first detected in 1967 and 1973, respectively. The results define a new typing scheme, which can be used for a comprehensive description of former and future epidemics. A list of strains and their epidemiologic data is appended.\r"

All infections were cured except for one in a patient with sickle cell anemia; this patient's illness recurred but was cured with a second course of cefotaxime followed by ceftriaxone. A review of the literature documented cures with cefotaxime in 50 of 61 patients with typhoid/paratyphoid fever, all of four with salmonella osteomyelitis, 12 of 14 with salmonella meningitis, and 44 of 49 with non-typhoid salmonella bacteremia.

More recently, this lipophilic yeast has been recovered from sick neonates with catheter-related infections. Malassezia fungemia was studied in seven patients, and the salient features of this infection in patients described in the literature were reviewed. Major risk factors include prolonged hospitalization, the presence of central venous catheters, and the use of intravenous fat emulsions. It is difficult to identify specific manifestations of fungemia in these complex cases occurring in patients with severe underlying disease; however, neonates often present with the signs and symptoms of sepsis and thrombocytopenia, whereas fever may be the only manifestation in adults. Some patients are asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they resolve upon removal of the colonized catheter. The role of the lipophilic nature of Malassezia in the pathogenesis of infection is apparent from the ability of intravenous fat emulsions to support the growth of the fungus in vitro. A special solid medium that can be used to determine the true prevalence of malassezia fungemia has been devised. M. furfur must be considered in the differential diagnosis of opportunistic infections in patients receiving central hyperalimentation and should be sought by the culture of blood on appropriate medium.\r"

Although all 11 patients were cured, diagnostic evaluation was often protracted as commoner causes of ureteral obstruction were excluded. Successful therapy required evacuation of the obstructing hyphal mass; open surgical procedures were necessary in five instances.

If true, this hypothesis will have some bearing on vaccine development and will suggest alternate strategies for disease control.\r"

Colonization of the upper respiratory tract by gram-negative bacilli is correlated with adherence of gram-negative bacilli to epithelial cells. Increased adherence is associated with a loss of fibronectin from the surface of oral epithelial cells, which presumably occurs as a result of the action of secretory proteases that denude cells of fibronectin. Thus, fibronectin may be described as a modulator of the composition of the oral flora. It seems more likely that the level of protease activity or the determinants that control the level of protease activity are the true modulators of the composition of the oral flora. The delineation of these determinants should lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia.\r"

The mean age at operation was 11 days. Subclavian flap aortoplasty was used in 27 cases, a lusoric artery in two, and combined end-to-end anastomosis and flap repair in five. The main pulmonary artery was banded in 13 of the 22 complex coarctation syndromes. Absorbable suture was used in the last 22 cases. There was one early postoperative death. Serious ischaemic complications (bowel or limb gangrene) arose in four patients who were in severe heart failure preoperatively. During follow-up averaging 1.9 years there were two recurrences of coarctation. Resection with end-to-end anastomosis combined with subclavian flap aortoplasty when there is bulging ductal tissue or long, narrow isthmus and use of absorbable vascular suture may further lower the incidence of recurrent coarctation.\r"

The duration of the first respiratory cycle after airway closure increased progressively with the volume of inflation in intact dogs and in dogs with autotransplanted left lung, though the increase was approximately halved following autotransplantation.\r"

Strains are constructed in which the insertion of a single P transposable element has caused a new mutation, greatly simplifying the genetic and molecular analysis of the affected gene. Mutagenesis is initiated by crossing two strains, each of which contains a specially designed P element. One element (jumpstarter), encoding P element transposase, efficiently mobilizes the second nonautonomous transposon (mutator), whose structure facilitates selection and cloning of new insertion mutations. Random mutator transpositions are captured in individual stocks that no longer contain jumpstarter, where they remain stable. This method was used to construct 1300 single P element insertion stocks which were then screened for recessive mutations. A library of single-element insertion strains will allow the structure and function of Drosophila genes to be readily correlated, and should have many other applications in Drosophila molecular genetics.\r"

Certain single-base substitutions in either HSE cause a dramatic reduction (forty-fold) in expression. Surprisingly, variations in sequences immediately flanking the HSEs also reduced levels of induction. One such variant that contains two perfect 14-base pair HSEs, which are correctly spaced relative to each other and the TATA box, retained only 7% of wild type-induced expression. These and additional analyses indicate that the heat-shock regulatory element includes sequences beyond the 14-base pair HSE and may be better described as a dimer of a 10-base pair sequence, NTTCNNGAAN.\r"

A variety of steroid and polypeptide hormones influence these processes, and the ovary in turn produces specific hormonal signals for endocrine regulation. One such signal is inhibin, a heterodimeric protein that suppresses the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from pituitary gonadotrophs. Rat inhibin complementary DNA probes have been used to examine the levels and distribution of inhibin alpha-and beta A-subunit messenger RNAs in the ovaries of cycling animals. Striking, dynamic changes have been found in inhibin messenger RNA accumulation during the developmental maturation of the ovarian follicle.\r"

The third sequence is part of the region involved in interferon regulation and is homologous to the enhancer element of the interferon beta gene.

Healthy volunteers underwent extremity amino acid flux measurement, percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsy and determination of skeletal muscle Em after ten days of starvation (ST), and after a subsequent ten day period of TPN. ST produced a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in plasma essential amino acids when compared with normal ambulatory volunteers. Subsequent administration of TPN produced a significant extremity uptake of all essential amino acids except for threonine and uptake of the nonessential amino acids taurine, glutamate, tyrosine and arginine. ST produced a significant reduction in skeletal muscle free intracellular glutamine and a significant increase in isoleucine and leucine. These changes in free intracellular amino acids were not reversed by administration of TPN. At the conclusion of ten days of ST and ten days of TPN, there was a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in skeletal muscle Em. The results demonstrate that abnormalities of intracellular amino acid concentrations and reduction of muscle Em are not specific to stress conditions, but rather they can be present during both unstressed ST and intravenous nutritional repletion.\r"

  ".W": "Many changes are under way in the payment for physician and hospital care of the surgical patient. Relatively little data have been analyzed on resource consumption for hospitalized surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize hospital resource consumption and outcome by age for surgical patients. All surgical admissions at a large academic medical center from Jan. 1, 1985, through March 31, 1986, were analyzed by means of the diagnostic related group (DRG) format. Total costs (exclusive of physician fees) for the 7341 surgical patients studied were $58,206,815. Mean cost per patient, length of stay, percent of outliers, and mortality increased with age. DRG case-mix index and the number of procedures per patient peaked at age 69 and then decreased. Emergency admission was high for the young (i.e., aged 18 to 24 years) and for very elderly patients (i.e., aged over 75 years). Blood transfusions increased steadily as the age of the patient increased; use of surgical intensive care units increased until age 64 years, then plateaued. This study demonstrated a number of trends in surgical patient age and use of resources. Under prospective payment systems (i.e., DRG reimbursement) financial risk increased with the age of the patient. Length of hospital stay and mortality increased with age; however, DRG case-mix index and the number of procedures per patient peaked at age 69, which suggests that elderly surgical patients (i.e., those above 70 years of age) may be more severely ill on average than younger patients.\r"

  ".U": "88146044\r", 
  ".W": "Inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) causes bronchoconstriction in atopic asthma, probably after in vivo conversion to adenosine. It has been suggested that adenosine potentiates preformed mediator release from mast cells on the mucosal surface of the airways by interacting with specific purinoceptors, without affecting the release of newly generated mediators. The airway response of nine non-atopic subjects with \"intrinsic\" asthma to inhaled AMP and the influence of the oral, selective H1 histamine receptor antagonist terfenadine on this response was investigated. The geometric mean provocation concentrations of histamine and AMP required to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) were 1.82 and 13 mmol/l. In subsequent placebo controlled time course studies the FEV1 response to a single inhalation of the PC20 histamine was ablated after pretreatment with oral terfenadine 180 mg. This dose of terfenadine caused an 80% inhibition of the bronchoconstrictor response to the PC20 AMP when measured as the area under the time course-response curve and compared with the response to PC20 AMP preceded by placebo. Terfenadine 600 mg failed to increase protection against AMP further, but both doses of terfenadine delayed the time at which the mean maximum fall in FEV1 after AMP was achieved. Terfenadine 180 mg had no effect on methacholine induced bronchoconstriction in the same subjects. These data suggest that inhaled AMP may potentiate the release of preformed mediators from preactivated mast cells in the bronchial mucosa of patients with intrinsic asthma.\r"

  ".U": "88146045\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of flurbiprofen, a potent cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, on histamine and methacholine reactivity was assessed in seven atopic subjects with asthma. Flurbiprofen 150 mg daily for three days displaced the histamine-FEV1 concentration-response curve to the right by 1.5 doubling doses, whereas no effect was observed on the response to methacholine. Subsequently the effects of flurbiprofen and terfenadine, a specific H1 histamine receptor antagonist, on allergen induced bronchoconstriction were studied in seven atopic but non-asthmatic subjects. The subjects inhaled the concentration of grass pollen allergen that had previously been shown to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 on separate occasions after prior treatment with placebo, flurbiprofen 150 mg daily for three days, terfenadine 180 mg three hours before challenge, and the combination of flurbiprofen and terfenadine. After placebo, allergen challenge caused a mean (SEM) maximum fall in FEV1 of 37.6% (2.6%) after 20 (3.7) minutes, followed by a gradual recovery to within 15% of baseline at 60 minutes. Terfenadine reduced the maximum allergen provoked fall in FEV1 to 21.5% (2.2%) and reduced the area under the time-response curve (AUC) by 50% (6%). Flurbiprofen alone reduced the mean maximum fall in FEV1 to 29.6% (3.2%) and reduced the AUC by 26%. The effect of the combination of flurbiprofen and terfenadine did not differ significantly from that of terfenadine alone. We conclude that histamine and prostaglandins contribute to immediate allergen induced bronchoconstriction and that a complex interaction occurs between the two classes of mediators.\r"

No significant differences were found in total and free thyroid hormone concentrations and basal concentrations of thyrotrophin, growth hormone, and prolactin; and their increments after injection of thyrotrophin releasing hormone were similar in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, and control patients. Three patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, however, had no thyrotrophin responses to thyrotrophin releasing hormone. In men, low testosterone concentrations were found both in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and in controls. Luteinising hormone concentrations were higher in men with chronic obstructive lung disease (p less than 0.02), whereas concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone in the two groups were not significantly different. There was no significant correlation between arterial blood gas tensions and these hormone measurements. General effects of age and illness may be more important than direct effects of hypoxia in determining hypothalamic-pituitary function in elderly patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Fifty-eight patients with no more than moderate aortic insufficiency who underwent cardiac catheterization were evaluated with two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler velocimetry to determine the peak velocity across the stenotic valve and aortic valve area (AVA) by means of the continuity equation. All 33 peak Doppler velocities of greater than or equal to 4 m/sec had critical AS (AVA less than or equal to 0.8 cm2 at catheterization). Conversely, six of seven patients with Doppler velocities of less than or equal to 3 m/sec had noncritical AS. The patient with a falsely low peak velocity had severely depressed left ventricular function. Doppler velocity alone was inadequate in determining severity of AS for patients with velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec. The continuity equation proved accurate in estimating AVA in the 46 patients for whom catheterization and ultrasound data were sufficient to compare calculated AVA (r = 0.81), and was also accurate for those patients with peak Doppler velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec (r = 0.90). These results suggest that Doppler velocimetry alone is adequate in determining critical vs noncritical AS in many patients, while the continuity equation should be applied for patients with peak velocities between 3 and 4 m/sec as well as in patients with severely depressed cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "A national survey of 1,065 physicians was carried out to document current use of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In early 1987, thrombolytic therapy was used by 66% of respondents. Among those who used thrombolytic therapy, 92% used streptokinase, 13% used tissue-type plasminogen activator and 3% used urokinase. Most (72%) used intravenous administration exclusively and only 5% used intracoronary administration exclusively. Despite widespread acceptance of thrombolytic therapy, most physicians gave it to less than 25% of their patients. Duration of symptoms was rated as the single most important factor affecting the decision to use thrombolytic therapy; 45% had a time limit of less than 4 hours and 85% had a time limit of less than 6 hours. Complications of AMI and electrocardiographic findings were factors also considered in the decision to give this therapy. A physician's adoption of thrombolytic therapy was significantly associated with several characteristics: specialty type, number of AMI patients treated, physician age and access to cardiac catheterization. In addition, physicians using thrombolytic therapy had a significantly different use of medications and laboratory tests for all patients with AMI. This survey documents rapid acceptance of thrombolytic therapy for AMI, particularly in patients with short duration of symptoms or evidence of high risk.\r"

  ".U": "88147831\r", 
  ".W": "Tocainide and quinidine were administered both as single agents and in combination to 14 patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias. Therapy with tocainide was limited by the occurrence of dose-related adverse reactions in 8 patients, but could be titrated to a dose that was well-tolerated in 13 of 14 and effective in 2 of 13. The addition of quinidine gluconate to the tolerated dose of tocainide increased the number of patients with arrhythmia suppression from 2 to 6. After tocainide washout, quinidine alone suppressed arrhythmias in only 3 patients. Analysis of electrocardiogram intervals showed that the drugs had additive effects on the coupling interval of the sinus beat to the predominant ectopic beat, but exerted antagonistic effects on the corrected QT interval. These findings suggest that the combination may be clinically useful, exerting pharmacologic effects unlike either agent alone.\r"
