Twenty additional cases are reviewed and compared with previously reported series. In patients with vitreous hemorrhage secondary to age-related macular degeneration, the appearance of vitreal blood is often preceded by extensive subretinal hemorrhage. Although this condition may be confused with a vitreous hemorrhage accompanying choroidal malignant melanoma, the correct diagnosis is usually apparent from clinical findings and ultrasonography. In most patients the prognosis for visual improvement is poor because of macular degeneration and extensive subretinal hemorrhage. A vitrectomy to remove the vitreous hemorrhage associated with macular degeneration is rarely beneficial.\r"

Over time the concept of the disease was expanded to include a group of angle closure glaucomas unresponsive to traditional miotic or filtering therapy. The haphazard lumping of many disease entities under such an umbrella term has caused confusion, which we attempt to resolve through a mechanistic approach to elucidating the pathogenesis of malignant glaucoma based on the anatomical location of obstruction to normal aqueous flow; surgical treatments are suggested based on the pathogenesis. Attention is drawn to the role of the vitreous and anterior hyaloid in combination with a block to normal aqueous circulation, redirection of its flow, high intraocular pressure and vitreous swelling in precipitating malignant glaucoma and creating a vicious circle to maintain it. Surgical management is directed to correcting the obstruction to normal aqueous flow and removing aqueous accumulated in the posterior chamber, vitreous or suprachoroidal space.\r"

  ".W": "Noninfectious corneal ulcers can occur as an isolated ocular problem (e.g., sequela of eye injury, Mooren's ulcer) or they may be associated with various collagen vascular or other autoimmune diseases, sometimes being the presenting sign of the disease. Conditions that affect the integrity of the ocular surface epithelium (exposure keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis, keratomalacia, recurrent corneal erosions) may also lead to development of sterile corneal ulcers. Rarely, these ulcers occur as a complication following cataract surgery. With recent advances in the understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of corneal melting, rapid and effective medical and surgical treatment is often able to halt relentless destruction of the cornea. Since treatment varies vastly depending on the underlying cause of the ulceration, prompt and accurate diagnosis is of critical importance. This review presents guidelines for the diagnosis of corneal ulcers, and a stepwise approach to their medical and surgical treatment.\r"

All patients were treated with antithyroid drugs until they were euthyroid and then, with randomization, the patients received either Lugol's iodine, 0.3 ml thrice daily, or placebo for 9 days in a double-blind fashion. Antithyroid drugs were continued throughout the study. Reduction in the diameter, time-averaged velocity (TAV), and volume flow (VF) of the STAs was demonstrated in all patients in the treatment group, whereas there were no consistent trends in the placebo group. The changes in TAV and VF were significantly different between the placebo and treatment groups (p less than 0.01 for TAV and p less than 0.005 for VF). These changes were more marked in patients with high initial VF and minimal in patients with low initial VF. On the basis of these results, we recommend that patients with high thyroid blood flow before thyroidectomy should receive Lugol's iodine preoperatively.\r"

Urinary excretion rates constitute a sensitive index of renal tubular function. The beta-2 M urine-to-serum ratio was measured in 25 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (15 preoperative and 10 treated conservatively) in addition to 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ratio was found to be significantly higher in both the operative and the conservatively managed groups compared to controls (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). After surgical excision of a single parathyroid adenoma in the 15 operative cases, the beta-2 M urine-to-serum ratio fell to normal limits. These preliminary findings indicate that the urine-to-serum beta-2 M ratio may be of value in detecting change in renal function in asymptomatic patients with hyperparathyroidism. Further studies are indicated to establish whether these subtle changes are associated with long-term morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative localizing studies are essential for patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism requiring reoperation, because of loss of normal tissue planes and because the hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue that remains is more likely to be situated in an ectopic position. The value of noninvasive and invasive localizing techniques was evaluated in 59 consecutive patients undergoing reoperation for persistent (40 patients) or recurrent (19 patients) hyperparathyroidism. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 17 patients; 11 results (65%) were positive, 3 (18%) were negative, and 3 (18%) were false-positive. Ultrasonography was performed in 52 patients; 29 (56%) were positive, 16 (31%) were negative, and 7 (13%) were false-positive. Computed tomography was performed on 41 patients; 19 (46%) were positive, 16 (39%) were negative, and 6 (15%) were false-positive. Thallium chloride 201-technetium 99m pertechnetate scans were used in 39 patients; 19 (49%) were positive, 11 (28%) were negative, and 9 (13%) were false-positive. One or more of these noninvasive tests was positive in 78% of the cases. Highly selective venous catheterization with measurement of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentration localized the abnormal parathyroid gland in 20 of 28 patients (71%) overall and in 8 of the 14 patients (57%) whose tumors were not identified by the noninvasive techniques. Since false-positive results were common, a combination of localizing studies was helpful in identifying the abnormal gland. Fifty-three of the 59 patients (90%) were successfully treated at the initial reoperation and three were successfully treated at a second reoperation. Advances in parathyroid localization have contributed to the improved surgical results in patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The remaining two were caused by endobronchial intubation. Of the cases caused by external injury, respiratory tract injury was confined to the cervical trachea in three. Two required tracheostomy and repair and the third was managed conservatively; all made satisfactory recoveries. Intrathoracic rupture was recognised on or soon after admission in three cases. One patient died of uncontrollable pulmonary haemorrhage before he could be operated on; immediate repair gave good long term results in the other two. In three cases rupture of the main bronchus was not recognised until complete obstruction developed three, five, and 12 weeks after the accidents. The strictures were resected and the lung re-expanded. Robertshaw endobronchial tubes ruptured the left main bronchus in two patients undergoing oesophageal surgery. Uneventful recovery followed immediate repair. The difficulty of confirming rupture of a major airway is discussed and the importance of conserving the lung when the diagnosis has been missed is emphasised.\r"

Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and no aneurysm on angiography also showed arterial narrowing with an incidence of 56%.

Five patients were investigated after carotid endarterectomy. A further 2 patients having staged carotid endarterectomy and open heart surgery were investigated during nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient selection permitted the assumption that middle cerebral artery flow remained proportional to internal carotid artery flow. The integrated time-mean values from consecutive 5-second periods were computed. The arithmetic mean internal carotid artery flow varied from 167 to 399 ml/min in individual patients, with individual ranges between +/- 15% and +/- 35% of the mean flow. The mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity varied from 32 to 78 cm/sec. The relation between flow volume and blood velocity was nearly linear under these conditions. Normalization of the data as percent of the individual arithmetic means permitted a composite analysis of data from all patients. Linear regression of normalized blood velocity (V') on normalized flow volume (Q') showed V' = 1.05 Q' - 5.08 (r2 = 0.898).\r"

We have studied the incidence of postoperative restenosis retrospectively in 265 patients following 310 carotid endarterectomies. Two hundred fourteen patients (248 endarterectomies) were examined at 6-12 month intervals using ocular pneumoplethysmography, spectral analysis, and B-mode imaging. The absolute incidence of recurrent carotid disease was 28% (69 of 248), with a 13% (33 of 248) incidence of hemodynamically significant restenosis and a 15% (36 of 248) incidence of hemodynamically insignificant disease. Life table analysis of the data projected a 32% incidence of hemodynamically significant restenosis after 7 years and a 40% incidence of hemodynamically insignificant recurrence. These data demonstrate a progressively increasing rate of restenosis. The incidence of ipsilateral neurologic events was 8% (24 of 310); 12 occurred in association with noninvasively evident recurrent disease (12 of 69, 17%), whereas 11 occurred in noninvasively determined normal arteries (11 of 179, 6%). Noninvasive follow-up was not available in 1 patient. Of the 12 events associated with recurrent disease, 5 occurred in association with hemodynamically significant restenosis (5 of 33, 15%), whereas 7 occurred in association with hemodynamically insignificant disease (7 of 36, 19%). Carotid endarterectomy is a durable operative procedure with 92% (286 of 310) of arteries remaining asymptomatic over the period of clinical follow-up. However, absolute and life table projections of the incidence of asymptomatic restenosis are high, and this factor should be considered in the selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy, particularly in the absence of lateralizing symptoms.\r"

Dissection was spontaneous in 8 patients, occurred after neck manipulation in 2 and after a potential minor injury to the neck in 3. Six had a history of common migraine, 4 were using oral contraceptives at the time of dissection, and 3 had fibromuscular dysplasia. Dissection was bilateral in 8 patients and associated with carotid dissection in 3. It usually presented with neck or occipital pain preceding basilar ischemic symptoms by a few minutes to 1 month. In 3 patients, transient ischemic attacks were the only manifestation of basilar ischemia, and in 1 patient there was no symptom of basilar ischemia despite bilateral vertebral dissection. In 19 of the 21 dissected vertebral arteries, the angiographic appearance was that of an irregular stenosis, which was associated in 6 arteries with pseudoaneurysmal formation. In 2 patients, 1 vertebral artery was occluded but the contralateral artery showed the typical irregular stenosis. The dissection involved only the third segment in 33%, only the second segment in 24%, and 2 or more segments in 38%. Eleven patients were treated with anticoagulants and 2 with aspirin; 11 recovered without sequelae and 2 had residual deficit. No recurrence was observed (mean follow-up 34 months). At control angiography (n = 12) or ultrasonic study (n = 1), 63% of dissected vertebral arteries had returned to normal, 26% showed marked improvement, and 11% were occluded. Our patient characteristics are compared with those of previously published cases. The validity of the distinction between spontaneous dissection and dissection associated with minor trauma is discussed.\r"

A literature review documented both clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that heparin may be effective in preventing ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage by reversing vasospasm, improving blood flow through narrowed vessels, and preventing the development of a proliferative angiopathy. Additional evidence suggests that heparinization of the cerebrospinal fluid following subarachnoid hemorrhage may prevent the development of hydrocephalus. In the only clinical trial using heparin after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the incidence of rebleeding in the heparinized patients was no higher than in the control group. We conclude that the existing preliminary data concerning a role for heparin in the management of the complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage is promising, but further controlled studies are needed prior to clinical application.\r"

Providing CMV-seronegative components was a considerable undertaking; a mean, per patient, of 19 units of red cells and 105 units of platelets was required. Twenty percent of the platelet support was provided by family members and 80 percent by volunteer donors. CMV-infection was eliminated in all but one patient not considered infected at the time of transplantation. The capability to provide CMV-seronegative components depends on an adequate supply of seronegative donors, a sensitive and practical screening method for CMV antibody, a major commitment by the blood bank, and close communication between the blood bank and the patients' physicians.\r"

  ".U": "88073459\r", 
  ".W": "It is clear that there are at least two classes of cancer-related genes. The more characterized of these are the oncogenes, whose activation appears to play a major role in human neoplasia. There are now two families of oncogenes, the myc and ras families, whose cooperation seems capable of transforming normal cells in culture to tumorigenic cells. As such, they appear to form complementation groups with immortalizing and transforming properties, respectively. Moreover, the oncogenes can be subclassified as tyrosine kinases or kinase related, GTP binding proteins, growth factors or growth factor receptors or nuclear proteins. More than 20 viral oncogenes have been identified, for which more than 30 proto-oncogenes or pseudogenes exist in the human genome. Many of these have been cloned, characterized to some extent, and mapped to particular chromosomes or regions of chromosomes. Further, more than 20 additional putative oncogenes or transforming genes have been identified by tumor DNA transfection studies or at sites of integration or translocation for which no viral transforming gene cognates exist. Oncogenes can be activated by increased or unregulated expression, increased copy number (duplication, amplification), or somatic mutation resulting in a protein with increased oncogenic potential. Examples of all of these mechanisms can be found in several specific human cancers or leukemias. The cytogenetic correlate of enhanced expression is a translocation between two chromosomes at specific breakpoints with no net loss of genetic material (e.g., increased c-myc expression resulting from the 8;14 translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma). The phenomenon of increased gene copy number can sometimes be visualized as trisomy or tetrasomy for a particular chromosome but more dramatically as the development of extrachromosomal DMs or as chromosomally integrated HSRs (e.g., the N-myc gene amplification seen in neuroblastoma). Finally, certain somatic mutations can be associated with translocations (e.g., the bcr/abl fusion product created as a result of the 9;22 translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia), but they are more commonly submicroscopic (as characterized by point mutations in the ras gene family). Evidence is accumulating for a second class of cancer-related genes whose absence or inactivation is associated with tumorigenesis. These genes are associated at the cytogenetic level with chromosomal deletions, in which the breakpoints may be variable, but specific, common regions are consistently deleted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. Evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. A recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in RTI has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. The pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. The synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. These mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. Both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. However, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. Data, thus far, indicate that there are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed RTI.\r"

  ".U": "88073472\r", 
  ".W": "There are now nine inherited diseases that have been identified in the pathway of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, including LCAD, MCAD, SCAD, and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies, two forms each of CPT and MAD deficiencies and an incompletely characterized disorder of primary carnitine deficiency. The varied range of clinical manifestations in this new group of diseases should attract the attention not only of general pediatricians (coma, hypoglycemia) but also of pediatric subspecialists in neurology (myopathy), cardiology (cardiomyopathy), and gastroenterology (fatty liver), as well as genetics and metabolism. The presenting features of the genetic defects in fatty acid oxidation fit well with the concept that fatty acid oxidation plays a major role in energy production during prolonged fasting and in working cardiac and skeletal muscle. Life-threatening episodes of coma and hypoglycemia induced by fasting are a common presenting feature in most of the fatty acid oxidation disorders (MCAD, LCAD, and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies, the infantile form of CPT deficiency, the mild form of MAD deficiency, and in some cases of primary carnitine deficiency). The hypoglycemia in these disorders is most easily explained by the inability of affected patients to use fatty acids as a fuel as a substitute for glucose. It should be stressed, however, that the coma in these disorders may occur from direct toxic effects of fatty acids or fatty acid intermediates before plasma glucose concentrations reach hypoglycemic levels. Severe disturbances of muscle function are a feature in several of the disorders; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and chronic skeletal muscle weakness occur in both the mild and severe forms of MAD deficiency, in primary carnitine deficiency, and in some patients with LCAD deficiency. In contrast, patients with the adult form of CPT deficiency have normal muscle strength but are prone to episodes of painful rhabdomyolysis induced by prolonged exercise. These manifestations presumably reflect the requirement of working cardiac and skeletal muscle for energy supplied from fatty acid oxidation. In two of the disorders, SCAD deficiency and the severe form of MAD deficiency, chronic CNS toxicity is a dominant feature. The severe effects on the brain in these two disorders may reflect the fact that short-chain fatty acids more readily cross the blood-brain barrier than longer-chain fatty acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mammographic equipment had been purchased by 71% of respondents after 1983. Most respondents (71%) monitored mammography equipment doses, usually at 6- to 12-month intervals. Manual breast examinations were done at the time of mammography at 42% of the facilities, and breast self-examination was taught at 32%. For screening, 87.4% used a two-view examination, 92% required the name of a referring physician to whom the report could be sent, 28% accepted self-referred patients, and only 12% charged a reduced fee for screening. Breast sonography was performed by 53% (93% hand-held vs 7% automated), but none used sonography for screening. Only one respondent reported using thermography; three used light scanning. A need for postgraduate mammography courses for radiologists was indicated by 81%, while 69% recommended technologist courses and 64% recommended 1-week fellowships for radiologists.\r"

  ".U": "88073689\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to define the potential of unenhanced and ferrite-enhanced MR to detect hepatic lymphoma. Rats were implanted with diffuse and focal hepatic lymphoma. Both in vitro measurements of relaxation times and in vivo MR imaging of normal liver and of diffuse and focal hepatic lymphoma were compared. Diffuse infiltrative hepatic lymphoma showed increased T1 (45%) and T2 (41%) relaxation times in vitro, but could not be distinguished from normal control livers on in vivo spin echo (SE) images with a repetition time of 500 msec and an echo time of 30 msec (SE 500/30) or SE 1500/60 images. Focal hepatic lymphoma showed increased T1 (185%) and T2 (115%) relaxation times relative to normal liver tissue. Focal hepatic lymphoma was undetectable on unenhanced SE 500/30 MR images (contrast-to-noise ratio, C/N = 0.4) and was slightly hyperintense on SE 1500/60 images (C/N = 1.1). Ferrite (50 mumol Fe/kg) was administered to improve tissue contrast. In normal control animals, T2 of liver in vitro decreased from 29.3 +/- 3.3 msec to 11.1 +/- 1.2 msec, and image signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of liver in vivo decreased from 16.1 +/- 2.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.3 (p less than .005). Ferrite-enhanced diffuse hepatic lymphoma showed in vitro T2 values and in vivo MR image S/N values indistinguishable from those of normal control animals. The T2 of focal hepatic lymphoma was essentially unaltered by ferrite. On SE 500/30 images, focal hepatic lymphoma became readily detectable, quantitated by a 35-fold increase in tumor-liver C/N. We conclude that clinical studies are warranted to determine the value of ferrite enhanced MR as a technique for the enhanced detection of focal hepatic lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the value of endovaginal sonography for evaluating women with a suspected ectopic gestation, we prospectively studied a group of 84 pregnant women in whom conventional transabdominal sonograms failed to show a living embryo. Of 84 patients studied, 25 had an ectopic gestation, 32 had a normal intrauterine pregnancy, and 27 had an abnormal (nonviable) intrauterine pregnancy. Endovaginal sonography, compared with transabdominal sonography, provided additional information in 50 cases (60%) and less information in only three cases (4%). Of 25 ectopic gestations, endovaginal sonography provided new information in 15 cases (60%) including detection of an extrauterine gestational sac (10 cases), extrauterine embryo (two cases), or adnexal mass (three cases) not observed on transabdominal sonography. Of 32 normal intrauterine pregnancies, endovaginal sonography provided additional information in 26 cases (81%) including detection of a yolk sac (14 cases), living embryo (11 cases), or small gestational sac (one case) not seen on transabdominal sonography. Of 27 abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, endovaginal sonography showed additional information in nine cases (33%) including detection of embryonic demise (three cases), retained intrauterine products (four cases), or a yolk sac (two cases) not seen on transabdominal sonography. Patient acceptance of endovaginal sonography was excellent; 82% of the patients preferred this method to transabdominal sonography, 13% expressed no preference, and 5% preferred transabdominal sonography. We conclude that endovaginal sonography can provide significant additional information in the majority of women who are referred for sonography with a suspected ectopic gestation. We believe that this method should become a integral part of sonographic evaluation in women who are suspected of having an ectopic gestation when conventional transabdominal sonography fails to show a living embryo.\r"

Patients with known obstructive uropathy, renal calculi, renal mass, or hematuria were excluded. In 189 patients, 17 (9%) had hydronephrosis: 11 unilateral (one with a solitary kidney) and six bilateral. Obstructive causes were subsequently established in the solitary kidney and in four patients with bilateral dilatation. These five patients (2.6%) with clinically significant hydronephrosis were shown subsequently to have a clinical history that strongly suggested the presence of urinary tract obstruction. Our data suggest that, in patients without a clinical history that suggests obstruction (such as calculi, bladder outlet obstruction, or pelvic mass), the likelihood of finding bilateral hydronephrosis by sonography is small.\r"

The results showed a significant difference in the mineral density of the posterior ribs of control subjects and those of patients who had osteoporosis (251.1 +/- 36 mg Ca2+/cm2 of rib vs 158.8 +/- 48 mg Ca2+/cm2, p less than or equal to .01) and a close correlation with values obtained by dual-photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (r = .77). The results suggest that this technique can provide an accurate assessment of the presence or absence of osteoporosis.\r"

ECG-gated studies were acquired at three frames per cardiac cycle. In 85% of patients, gated conventional subtraction resulted in studies of superior image quality in comparison with those obtained with hybrid techniques, both gated and nongated. In the 15% in whom hybrid subtraction studies were judged superior, the hybrid images were almost exclusively integrated by video frame averaging and thus were nongated. In a separate subset of patients who had conventional nongated studies, there was no difference in the percentage of diagnostic studies (93%) and nondiagnostic studies (7%) when compared with conventional gated temporal subtraction. Cardiac gating appears to be superior to hybrid subtraction for studies of the thoracic aorta that use intraarterial digital subtraction angiography, but neither technique offered any significant advantage over conventional nongated acquisition.\r"

The patients received large doses (2.5 ml/kg body weight) of contrast material for IV digital subtraction angiography. Urine samples, collected before, immediately after, and on the first and third days after digital subtraction angiography, were analyzed for albumin, alanil-aminopeptidase, alpha-glucosidase, and beta-2-microglobulin. The changes noted were mild and of short duration with both contrast agents, despite the high dose given. These results suggest that, at least as far as renal toxicity is measured by these tests is concerned, ionic monomers can be safely used instead of more expensive nonionic media in procedures, such as digital subtraction angiography, that require high doses of contrast material.\r"

The incidence of total occlusion was highest in the right subclavian artery (n = 12). Average percent luminal stenosis (mean +/- S.D.) over the aorta and its branches tended to be smaller in patients with prior corticosteroid therapy (17.3 +/- 14.6%) than in those without (22.0 +/- 9.8%), but the difference was not significant.

  ".U": "88073888\r", 
  ".W": "We review the hypothesis that the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is higher in men than in women due to differences in plasma lipoprotein risk factors between the sexes. Men and women appear to be equally susceptible to the effects of lipoprotein risk factors for CHD, and the difference between the sexes in lipoprotein risk factors for CHD appears to be consistent with their being, at least in part, responsible for the sex difference in CHD. This is apparent both when men and women of equal age are compared, and when age-related variations in the sex differences in plasma lipoproteins and CHD are considered. Differences between the sexes in lipoprotein concentrations are still present when sex differences in adiposity, cigarette smoking, physical activity, and diet are taken into account. Evidence relating these sex differences in CHD and lipoproteins to the effects of sex hormones is critically examined. It is commonly accepted that androgens induce changes in lipoprotein concentrations that would predispose towards CHD, whereas estrogens are held to have opposite effects. However, much of the evidence for this comes from studies of changes associated with administration of synthetic gonadal steroids or with changes in gonadal function. Studies of differences in lipoprotein metabolism in normal men and women are extremely limited. In males high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels fall at puberty, correlating with the rise in plasma testosterone concentrations. In females, HDL levels do not change at puberty, despite the rise in estrogen concentrations. Evidence for lipoprotein changes during the menopause, when estrogen levels decline, is equivocal. Similarly, the evidence for an increase in CHD incidence at the menopause is inconclusive. National mortality data indicate that the decreasing sex difference in CHD after 50 years of age is due to a declining rate of increase in men rather than to an acceleration in CHD incidence in women. In men the age-related increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations diminishes beyond 50 years of age, whereas in women the rate of increase remains unchanged. Studies of the effects of gonadectomy are of doubtful relevance in assessing the roles of sex hormones in CHD, and have not been performed with sufficient rigor to provide definitive conclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy and safety of oral mexiletine hydrochloride and quinidine sulfate were compared at 29 clinical centers in a double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 491 patients with benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Responders were defined as those who had at least a 70% reduction in the frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) that persisted for 12 weeks, and who experienced no intolerable side effects that required discontinuation of therapy. Of the patients available for analysis, 71 of 232 (31%) in the mexiletine and 73 of 225 (32%) in the quinidine group met these criteria. The dose range used for mexiletine was 200 to 400 mg every 8 hours, and that for quinidine 200 to 400 mg every 6 hours. More than half of the patients in each group were successfully treated with the smallest dose (200 mg every 8 hours mexiletine vs 200 mg every 6 hours for quinidine). Quinidine significantly prolonged the QT interval, whereas mexiletine did not. Proarrhythmic reactions were recorded in 18 of 221 (9%) patients taking quinidine and 10 of 217 (5%) patients taking mexiletine. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the 2 groups; in both, the most common side effects were related to the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. Mexiletine thus represents an alternative to quinidine for the treatment of patients with ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

A study was conducted in 87 patients; 25 (mean age 34 +/- 10 years) were normal (group I), 29 (60 +/- 20 years) had organic heart disease without ventricular tachycardia (group II) and 33 (62 +/- 15 years) had sustained ventricular tachycardia (group III). In all patients signal-averaged electrocardiography (200 beats) was performed using a sharp, bidirectional filter and data analyzed using the following 7 high-pass filter settings: 10, 15, 20, 25, 40, 80 and 100 Hz. For each filter the duration of the signal-averaged QRS complex, the low-amplitude signals of less than 40 microV and the root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 ms (RMS-40) were determined. Normal values for each filter were determined from group I patients. In all 3 groups, quantitative signal-averaged variables were filter dependent. There was a progressive and marked decrease in RMS-40 and a progressive and marked increase in low-amplitude signal duration as the high-pass filtering was increased from 10 to 100 Hz. In contrast, high-pass, filter-dependent changes in signal-averaged QRS duration were less marked. The sensitivity and specificity for each filter using RMS-40 as the index of late potentials in separating group III patients from group II patients were: 10 Hz-64% and 52%; 15 Hz-57% and 72%; 20 Hz-57% and 76%; 25 Hz-42% and 90%; 40 Hz-61% and 83%; 80 Hz-88% and 69%; and 100 Hz-79% and 62%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To characterize further the pathophysiology of the neurohormonal vasoconstrictor pathways in congestive heart failure (CHF), plasma renin activity, plasma norepinephrine, blood pressure, blood volume and renal hemodynamics were measured in 12 patients with mild to moderate CHF. In addition, the response to the gravitational stress of head-up tilt and the influence of 3 weeks of furosemide treatment as stimuli of neurohormonal activity were assessed. Supine plasma renin activity before diuretics was relatively normal at 1.94 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/hr and was significantly increased to 3.9 +/- 2.7 ng/ml/hr after diuretics. During tilt, there was a significant reflex increase in plasma renin activity both before and after diuretics. Plasma norepinephrine was also relatively normal before diuretics (325 +/- 211 pg/ml), did not increase after diuretics, but showed significant increases during tilt both before and after diuretics. Diuretic administration led to decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but there was no change in body weight or total blood volume. In addition, diuretic administration did not result in any significant changes of renal blood flow (546 +/- 119 to 634 +/- 204 ml/min/1.73m2), glomerular filtration rate (81 +/- 22 to 90 +/- 27 ml/min/1.73m2) or filtration fraction (0.26 to 0.25). The present study demonstrates that the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system were not activated in the early symptomatic stages of CHF and that baroreceptor stimulation of these pathways during head-up tilt was relatively preserved. Renin secretion increased during diuretic administration, suggesting that the macula densa signal for renin release was also preserved in patients with relatively mild CHF.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion, single oral doses (80 and 100 mg) of DPI 201-106 were administered to 15 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Dose-dependent increases in cardiac index (25%, p = 0.016), left ventricular stroke work index (24%, p = 0.018), left ventricular stroke volume index (32%,p = 0.005) and QTc interval (7%, p = 0.009) were observed. Significant effects on heart rate and systemic arterial pressure were not observed. Positive correlations of QTc interval with DPI plasma level (r = 0.64, p = 0.0001), stroke work index (r = 0.47, p = 0.0001) and ventricular ectopic activity on ambulatory electrocardiography (r = 0.49, p = 0.0001) were observed.

  ".W": "The various functions of arterial endothelium may be altered during pulmonary and arterial hypertension. Changes in the endothelium (or function) associated with hypertension are described. In both acute and chronic hypertension, permeability of the endothelium is enhanced. During the acute phase of hypertension, hyperplasia (cell replication) of the endothelium occurs while cell hypertrophy (enlarged cell size) and an increase in homocellular tight junctions are associated with sustained elevations of blood pressure. Endothelium may contribute to the increase in smooth muscle mass or cell number reported with various models of hypertension. Increased endothelial uptake or metabolism of norepinephrine and serotonin occurs during hypertension. The biotransformation of adenine nucleotides and various peptides by the endothelium is not altered by hypertension. Synthesis of prostacyclin is enhanced in the spontaneously hypertensive and Goldblatt hypertensive rat. Metabolism of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha and prostacyclin by prostaglandin 15-hydroxydehydrogenase is impaired in the genetic models. Responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators are impaired in acute and chronic models of hypertension. Production of relaxing factor by the endothelium is not inhibited, but rather the vascular smooth muscle fails to respond. Acute, severe hypertension potentiates the response to serotonin, presumably by attenuating the release or response to relaxing factor(s). In the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, the endothelium releases a constricting factor in response to acetylcholine. Pulmonary arterial endothelium (and other vessels) releases a vasoconstrictor that is blocked by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. It is not clear whether this pressor factor is thromboxane A2. Cultured endothelial cells release a polypeptide that contracts arteries; however, any relation to hypertension is not known.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a significant independent risk factor for mortality from coronary heart disease, including sudden death. The proportion of sudden death to total death due to coronary heart disease remains high, at about 50% to 60%, despite the continuing downward trend in coronary heart disease mortality observed in the U.S. during the last decade. Prevalence of LV hypertrophy, determined by electrocardiogram in hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg), including tall R wave and evidence of repolarization abnormality, is around 5%. The prevalence of LV hypertrophy by echocardiography is estimated at 44% to 48%. LV hypertrophy on electrocardiogram underestimates the magnitude of the problem of LV hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Its overall sensitivity is less than 60%. The incidence of LV hypertrophy in hypertensive patients is lower when hypertension is treated successfully than when the patient is left either untreated or inadequately treated; successful treatment of hypertension causes regression of LV hypertrophy. However, hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy have a poor prognosis despite treatment. The available evidence derived from the results of large clinical trials suggests that hypertensive patients should be treated before there is electrocardiographic evidence of LV hypertrophy.\r"

Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the supine position, immediately after and 5 minutes after standing. Modified Bruce protocol treadmill tests were performed to determine the time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression, time to onset of chest pain and time to termination of exercise. Diltiazem monotherapy resulted in equivalent blood pressure control in 28 of 38 patients (74%). In the remaining patients, blood pressure control was achieved with resumption of the diuretic. Blood pressure with beta blocker plus diuretic compared with diltiazem were, in the supine position 137 +/- 22/82 +/- 7 (+/- 1 standard deviation) versus 139 +/- 22/82 +/- 8 mm Hg, immediately after standing 131 +/- 20/84 +/- 9 versus 133 +/- 21/82 +/- 10 mm Hg and after standing for 5 minutes 134 +/- 19/85 +/- 8 versus 137 +/- 18/85 +/- 9 mm Hg (difference not significant for each). The heart rate with diltiazem was higher supine (67 +/- 11 versus 60 +/- 11 beats/min), standing (73 +/- 13 versus 64 +/- 14 beats/min) and 5 minutes after standing (73 +/- 14 versus 63 +/- 14 beats/min, p less than 0.01 for each).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unless pressure is reduced and maintained at controlled levels, it will be associated with impaired function of the primary target organs of the disease: brain, heart, kidneys and blood vessels. The effects of an elevated arterial pressure on heart and kidneys and the effects of antihypertensive therapy on target-organ involvement will be discussed. Cardiac involvement primarily relates to left ventricular hypertrophy and its regression with treatment, and in the kidney to altered intrarenal hemodynamics and effects of treatment. The role of calcium antagonists, primarily diltiazem, is discussed with reference to its hemodynamic effects on reducing total peripheral resistance and arterial pressure associated with regression of ventricular hypertrophy and maintenance of renal blood flow without inordinately increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure. Studies suggest a beneficial role of diltiazem in the treatment of essential hypertension.\r"

Goal blood pressure was defined as less than 90 mm Hg or a reduction of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg for patients with baseline pressures of 95 to 99 mm Hg in the supine position and was achieved in 60% of diltiazem-treated and 63% of atenolol-treated patients. The mean diltiazem dosage at the end of the study was 329 mg daily; for atenolol it was 80 mg daily. Adverse reactions considered possibly or probably drug related were reported by 26% of diltiazem patients and 38% of atenolol patients. Although both drugs were associated with a slower heart rate, atenolol patients showed a significantly greater negative chronotropic effect. Diltiazem, in a sustained-release form taken twice daily, is as effective as atenolol as a sole antihypertensive agent. It has a favorable side-effect profile and may be a useful alternative antihypertensive medication compared with existing beta-blocker therapy with atenolol.\r"

After drug infusion, a variety of rhythm and conduction disturbances were noted; the most important were transient prolongation of the PR Interval (first-degree atrioventricular block), a single episode of second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz I) associated with T-wave inversion and a transient episode of junctional escape rhythm and atrioventricular dissociation. Intravenous diltiazem had no consistent effect on glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. Natriuresis and kaliuresis were observed only at the highest infusion dose. It is concluded that an alternative dosing regimen will be required if intravenous diltiazem is to be used safely and effectively to control blood pressure in patients with hypertensive disease.\r"

In animal studies, both forms of Fe have similar bioavailability when administered in equal amounts. High-dose carbonyl Fe was well tolerated with gastrointestinal side effects similar those observed with standard FeSO4 therapy. The 10-fold larger amount of Fe resulted in a mean 1.5-fold increase in estimated Fe absorption. Both regimens corrected anemia but neither replenished storage Fe. These results suggest that the principal advantage to the use of carbonyl Fe would derive from its safety rather than from the large doses that can be given.\r"

The spontaneous 96-h anti-ss-DNA levels in the copper-deficient group were lower than those in the control group. The exogenous colony-forming units (CFUs) were significantly enhanced in the copper-deficient mice. The decreased splenic lymphoid populations, decreased anti-ss-DNA titers, and increased exogenous CFUs in the copper-deficient mice appear to be due to an increase in erythropoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis.\r"

Over the low-GI diet significant reductions were seen in serum fructosamine (7.0 +/- 1.0%, p less than 0.01), 12-h blood glucose profile (37 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01), and total serum cholesterol (15 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01). As a measure of insulin secretion, 24-h urinary C-peptide levels were 32 +/- 10% lower (p less than 0.05) after the low-GI than after the high-GI diet. Lower C-peptide levels were maintained after a standard carbohydrate challenge after the low-GI diet despite higher blood glucose levels. Differences in blood glucose were not seen after a 5-g intravenous glucose challenge. These results are of interest with respect to the effect that prolonged postprandial reductions in nutrient fluxes and insulin secretion may have on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and renal function.\r"

Lower but prolonged elevation of both hormones was observed after the CF meal. The C-peptide:insulin molar ratio was decreased profoundly at 30 and 60 min after each meal. After the C meal it returned to normal within 120 min but then was increased above the basal value at 180 min. After the CF meal the reduction in the C-peptide:insulin molar ratio persisted until 180 min after food intake and then the ratio increased above the level at 240 min. It is concluded that both meals increase the peripheral insulin level in two ways: increasing secretion and decreasing removal of the hormone. At the end of digestion, the latter effect is reversed and increased insulin removal seems to occur.\r"

Within 24 hours of infection, in situ hybridization with HIV DNA probe detected cytoplasmic viral RNA. Viral core antigen was detected in infected cells over the subsequent two to ten days by means of an immunocytochemical assay employing monoclonal antibodies. Several days later, cell-free virus was detected by both reverse transcriptase assay and a p25gag antigen-capture assay. When these methods were applied to monitor cultures of ten sero-positive persons' PMCs, a similar progression of virus replication was apparent: cytoplasmic viral RNA was detected in infected PMCs by day 3, with the subsequent appearance of intracellular viral proteins (days 6-9) and cell-free virus (days 12-21). In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry offer complementary, sensitive, and specific approaches for monitoring the early stages of acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus replication in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve cases of pure ovarian teratoma were studied by immunohistochemical methods to determine the incidence and localization of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) production. There were six mature teratomas (grade 0) and six immature ones (grades 1-3). Three tumors (grades 1, 3, and 3 and stages III, I, and III, respectively) had isolated foci of AFP immunoreactivity in yolk-sac-like vesicles, intestinal-type epithelium, or tissue resembling liver, whereas the other nine tumors had no AFP-positive components. The former three patients had preoperative serum AFP determinations; the values were elevated in two of them, and in both instances the oncofetoantigen became undetectable one month after oophorectomy. Both patients are alive and well 15 and 25 months later; the third patient with a normal serum AFP before surgery and a positively stained tumor died of recurrent disease. The authors' findings indicate that the production of AFP in pure ovarian teratomas recapitulates its pattern of synthesis during ontogeny. Furthermore, it is suggested that a preoperative elevation of serum AFP in a pure ovarian teratoma does not seem to correlate with stage or grade, beyond minimizing the possibility that the tumor is grade 0, or mature.\r"

We therefore designed an assay in which this ratio was increased 25-fold over that of our current standard assay and 1,000-fold over that of most described methods. This assay was then compared with our standard assay, with one of the original assays, and with a commercial kit. Both of our assays, especially the newer sensitive method, detected antibody in much greater dilutions of positive serum than the other assays. The sensitive assay also detected antibody in 17% of pernicious anemia sera negative by our standard technique. We calculated that anti-IF antibody can be detected with the sensitive assay in 78% of our patients with pernicious anemia, compared with 73% by our standard assay, 65% by the commercial kit, and 61% by the original method of Gottlieb and colleagues. No antibody was detected in 35 control sera with the new assay, which suggests that the increased sensitivity did not come at the expense of diminished specificity. The increased sensitivity enhances the value of the anti-IF antibody as a major screening and diagnostic tool in pernicious anemia.\r"

Although not specifically developed for yeast inoculum preparation, the Prompt Inoculation System (3M) provides a novel alternative approach that may provide a more standardized yeast inoculum than previously employed methods. The authors examined the relationship between the number of colonies picked with the Prompt Inoculation Wand and the hemacytometer and viable colony counts for each of six test organisms, including Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Cryptococcus neoformans. They found that by picking five colonies 1-2 mm in diameter, inoculum densities of 1 to 5 X 10(6) CFU/mL were obtained with most of the test organisms. A considerably higher inoculum density was observed with C. glabrata (1 to 2 X 10(7) CFU/mL) because of the small size of this organism. No overfilling of the Inoculation Wand was observed when more colonies were touched. This study indicates that the Prompt Inoculation System offers a convenient and simple method for yeast inoculum preparation.\r"

Recurrence rates with the FDA-approved drugs for maintenance therapy, cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are comparable when compared as \"weighted\" or \"unweighted\" means. H2-blockers reduce the annual recurrence from nearly 70% to about 25%. The duration of maintenance treatment is uncertain, but probably should not be less than 1 yr. Cimetidine maintenance for up to 5 yr has not disclosed new side effects, and the rate of reactions decreases after the first yr. Maintenance is economically superior to intermittent treatment or surgery in the ulcer population, but long-term management should be individualized according to risk factors for recurrence.\r"

Among colonic cancer patients, MIF and LAI were positive in 17 out of 18, but CEA was elevated in eight. MIF and CEA were negative in all 16 normal control subjects; LAI was negative in 13. Among patients with colonic adenomas, MIF and LAI were positive in three of five; CEA was negative in all. In the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease group, MIF was positive in seven of 22, LAI was positive in 11, and CEA was negative in all 22. Thus, MIF and LAI appear to be sensitive marker's for human colonic cancer. More extensive studies and precise characterization of these groups are warranted.\r"

Infection occurs when barriers to microorganism invasion are disrupted. To establish and maintain strong barriers against this invasion, care must be taken with placement of the catheter and with short- and long-term maintenance. There must be particular emphasis on planning placement of the catheter. Exit-site selection, type and configuration of the catheter, whether the catheter will contain one or two cuffs, and whether placement will be midline or lateral are all important factors to be considered. Tips are offered to enhance barrier establishment as the catheter is placed, as is a discussion of postplacement exit-site and wound care, and exit-site care after healing has occurred. Finally, the importance of recognizing catheter-related infections is emphasized and four types of infection are defined. Given the anecdotal nature of much of the material presented and the lack of well-defined clinical research on the subject, carefully designed randomized prospective studies are needed to determine the best method for both catheter placement and maintenance.\r"

The two oldest children have had progression of their disease to end-stage with subsequent successful transplantation. The youngest sibling continues to have normal renal function. All three patients had renal biopsies prior to the onset of renal insufficiency and each of the biopsies showed the presence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with mild diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Finally, HLA-typing revealed the presence of DRw8 in all three siblings and the father. This report further suggests that genetic factors may be quite important in the development of the lesion of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\r"

Its efficacy, safety, and tolerance in these patients is reviewed. The efficacy of nabumetone in the treatment of soft tissue injury has been demonstrated to be similar to that of soluble aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. It was not possible in these studies to demonstrate a definite advantage over placebo, and the reasons for this are discussed along with some suggestions for future studies. There were no serious adverse experiences reported, and nabumetone was well tolerated and compared favorably with the other agents used, including placebo. It caused significantly fewer gastrointestinal side effects than soluble aspirin. Nabumetone is an appropriate choice of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of sports injury.\r"

A total of 2,400 of these patients with a variety of rheumatic disorders have been investigated in studies outside of the United States. Studies in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis have demonstrated that nabumetone is effective in the treatment of these conditions and that this effectiveness is maintained in many patients in the long term. Nabumetone appears to be well tolerated and there is no evidence from patients receiving treatment for 12 months or more of any clinically significant adverse effects on hematologic or biochemical parameters. Thus, these studies support the use of nabumetone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 1,924 persons (rheumatoid arthritis, 835; osteoarthritis, 1,073; volunteers, 16) received nabumetone in United States clinical trials. Nine hundred eighty-eight patients have received nabumetone treatment for periods of more than one year, and 375 patients have received treatment for longer than two years. Four hundred eighty patients over 65 years of age have received treatment with nabumetone, and 224 of these elderly patients have received treatment for periods of more than one year. The nabumetone dose most commonly used in all double-blind trials was 1,000 mg at night. In long-term, open-label studies, which were usually extensions of the double-blind trials, patients could increase the dose to 2,000 mg per day. Nine hundred nineteen patients received doses of more than 1,000 mg per day. Adverse experience information was collected at each visit, including information for some patients receiving treatment for more than three years. Laboratory data were collected periodically throughout the trials, and the data were assessed for trends over time. The adverse experience pattern observed for nabumetone is similar to that described for clinical trial data for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, it is noteworthy that the pattern observed for nabumetone is from clinical trials with approximately 1,000 patients receiving treatment for periods of one year or more. This long-term patient exposure in clinical trials far exceeds long-term clinical trial data for other agents. The types and frequencies of adverse experiences reported by persons treated with nabumetone are relatively constant over the long time period covered by these trials. Also, the adverse experience patterns remained generally constant over time for various populations: all patients, patients 65 or older, female patients, male patients, and patients who received an increased dose of nabumetone. Although some statistically significant trends were detected for some laboratory parameters, there was little indication of significant clinical patterns. Although there were patients with individually important laboratory values, nabumetone was not associated with clinically important adverse laboratory patterns. Overall, the adverse experience data and laboratory data indicate that nabumetone is safe for the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.\r"

After three weeks of treatment, nabumetone was significantly better tolerated than naproxen or indomethacin. Trial 2 was a randomized trial with 24 patients per group that compared 1 g of nabumetone given at night with 250 mg of naproxen given in the morning and 500 mg given at night for a period of three months. This single-blind study revealed that the number of patients with microscopic or macroscopic mucosal lesions was significantly smaller following intake of nabumetone. Concerning efficacy, as judged clinically by a rheumatologist, treatment with nabumetone was superior as well.\r"

Therapy must be guided by the acute or chronic phase of the disease and must embrace chemical, psychologic, and physical modalities to achieve the goals of pain relief and the restoration of immune balance. Rheumatoid arthritis can no longer be considered benign since it impairs the duration as well as the quality of life. Therapy should be aggressive depending upon the predictors of more destructive disease.\r"

The safety and efficacy of nabumetone 1,000 mg taken at bedtime was compared with that of aspirin 900 mg four times daily in the treatment of adult patients with active class II or III classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis. Two hundred sixty-four patients were entered into the study. Two hundred fifty-seven (126 nabumetone and 131 aspirin) patients were evaluable for safety. Two hundred thirty-four (113 nabumetone and 121 aspirin) patients were evaluable for efficacy. There was significant improvement in each of six clinical measurements of efficacy in both treatment groups and little difference between groups. The somewhat greater improvement in articular index and duration of morning stiffness in the nabumetone-treated group did not reach statistical significance. There was an equal percentage of patient withdrawal for lack of efficacy in each group. Overall, the rate of patient withdrawal due to adverse experiences was greater (p = 0.01) for aspirin-treated patients. These experiences were usually dispepsia, abdominal pain, and tinnitus. It was concluded that nabumetone was an effective anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with less toxicity than aspirin.\r"

There was a low incidence of adverse experiences during this study, with no patients withdrawing from the study because of side effects from either drug. Efficacy was equal, with both compounds sharing the same degree and rate of improvement. All of the patients completing the double-blind phase were then switched to open-label treatment with nabumetone. The dosage of nabumetone was gradually increased. At the end of one year, 84 patients remained in the study (52 taking 1,000 mg per day, 23 taking 1,500 mg, and nine taking 2,000 mg). This gradual increase has continued, and, at this time, 61 patients remain in the study (seven taking 1,000 mg per day, 24 taking 1,500 mg, and 30 taking 2,000 mg). There have been very few side effects. From this study, it can be concluded that nabumetone is at least as effective as naproxen and, even at higher doses, had an acceptable safety profile for extended use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Aspirin-treated patients experienced a greater frequency of withdrawal from the study because of adverse experiences (34 percent versus 13 percent), a greater incidence of having at least one treatment-related adverse experience (73 percent versus 52 percent), a greater percentage of patients with at least one moderate or severe treatment-related adverse experience (47 percent versus 22 percent), and a greater percentage of patients with treatment-related adverse experiences affecting the gastrointestinal system (43 percent versus 32 percent) or the inner ear (32 percent versus 10 percent). The results of this study demonstrated that nabumetone, 1,000 mg at bedtime, is as efficacious as aspirin, 900 mg four times daily, produces fewer adverse effects, and is indicated in the treatment of osteoarthritis.\r"

Five efficacy parameters were measured: patients' assessment of overall osteoarthritis activity and pain, physicians' assessment of overall osteoarthritis activity and pain, and physicians' assessment of pain with respect to a declined activity. All 489 patients who took medication were included in the evaluation of safety, and 455 patients (227 in the nabumetone group and 228 in the naproxen group) were evaluated for efficacy. Significant improvement in all five efficacy parameters occurred in both groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups at the end of the study in any of the five efficacy parameters. Twenty-three percent of nabumetone and 17 percent of naproxen patients withdrew from the study for lack of efficacy. At least one possible or probable treatment-related adverse experience was reported for 45 percent of nabumetone-treated patients and 42 percent of those given naproxen, and in 19 percent of the nabumetone-treated and 18 percent of the naproxen-treated patients these experiences were moderate or severe. However, only 7 percent of patients in each group withdrew from the study due to adverse experiences. Nabumetone and naproxen have comparable safety and efficacy, suggesting that a single, nighttime dose of nabumetone is a convenient, effective, and safe treatment for osteoarthritis.\r"

Eleven of 17 patients had a significant depressive state as assessed by either the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Scala di Autovalutazione per la Depressione (SAD) rating scale. The number of trigger points plus painful anatomic sites decreased after administration of SAMe (p less than 0.02) but not after placebo treatment. In addition, scores on both the Hamilton and SAD rating scales improved after SAMe administration (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.005, respectively), whereas they did not significantly change after placebo treatment. In all the patients, there was a good correlation between scores on the Hamilton rating scale and the number of trigger points. Thus, this preliminary study confirms the close relationship between primary fibromyalgia and psychologic disturbances, particularly with regards to a depressive state. SAMe treatment, by improving the depressive state and reducing the number of trigger points, seems to be an effective and safe therapy in the management of primary fibromyalgia.\r"

Experimental investigations suggest that the administration of SAMe exerts analgesic and antiphlogistic activities and stimulates the synthesis of proteoglycans by articular chondrocytes with minimal or absent side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other organs. The results of extensive clinical trials, which have enrolled about 22,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the last five years, support the clinical effectiveness and the optimal tolerability of SAMe administration. The intensity of therapeutic activity of SAMe against osteoarthritis is similar to that exerted by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but its tolerability is higher. Based on these findings, SAMe is proposed as the prototype of a new class of safe drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis.\r"

The material is remarkably well tolerated when given by injection or intravenous infusion for this purpose, even in elderly or demented patients. Assuming that the toluene sulfonate component is inert, SAMe appears to have central neuropharmacologic effects after systemic injection in high doses. Nevertheless, the functional consequences of these remain unclear and, indeed, the ability of exogenous SAMe to reach the brain, and especially neuronal cytoplasm, is limited. SAMe has small effects on monoamine metabolism and, after injection, appears to have effects on the microviscosity of cell membranes that may be related to stimulation of phospholipid synthesis. The recent introduction of an orally administered form of SAMe for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis promises to stimulate further study of SAMe in disease-associated depression, major depressive disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.\r"

It is extensively absorbed only in the presence of food and is transported through the bloodstream by albumin. Fenofibrate is taken up by both the liver and kidney. Except for a small percentage (about 5 percent) reduced at the ketone moiety before conjugation, most drug is excreted as a conjugate in the urine. Less than 20 percent is excreted through the bile. In normal persons, at steady state with usual doses of 100 mg three times daily, the plasma half-life approximates 30 hours. Because fenofibrate is not dialyzable, it has a markedly prolonged half life in patients with renal failure and should not be used.\r"

A review of the European literature and unpublished studies supplied by the manufacturer (Laboratoires Fournier, Dijon, France) has been compiled with the data recently reported from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study completed in the United States. In general, fenofibrate has been found to reduce serum triglyceride levels by 30 to 60 percent in patients with type II B and IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Serum cholesterol levels were also reduced by 20 to 25 percent in this group of hypertriglyceridemic patients. A similar reduction in serum cholesterol levels was also found in type II A patients (normal triglyceride levels). Low-density lipoprotein levels were usually reduced in those patients with elevated levels and high-density lipoprotein levels increased when baseline levels were low. Fenofibrate also produced a 10 to 28 percent reduction in uric acid that was sustained for years. The incidence of unwanted effects ranged from 2 to 15 percent in the open trials lasting from a few months up to six years. Gastrointestinal problems (abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and constipation) are most common, occurring in approximately 5 percent of patients. Reports including fatigue, headache, loss of libido, impotence, dizziness, and insomnia were grouped as neurologic and occurred with a total incidence of 3 to 4 percent. In about 1 percent of patients, muscle tenderness developed, often accompanied by elevated creatine phosphokinase levels. These and the gastrointestinal problems occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo-treated cohort in controlled studies. In approximately 2 percent of patients, a skin rash developed, an incidence that appears significantly higher than that of placebo control groups. Liver changes in rodents have included marked peroxisome proliferation and increased hepatic carcinomas with very high doses. In humans, only a small increase in incidence of elevated levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase seems to be present and is not clearly different from that of the control groups. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin levels are often decreased with no known undesirable effects. Investigations into the lithogenicity of bile indicated a significant increase in five studies. However, there has been no evidence of a significant rise in the incidence of cholelithiasis in the clinical trials completed to date.\r"

Fenofibrate also inhibits cholesterol synthesis prior to processing mevalonate, indirectly causing significant reduction of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. The drug may inhibit acyl-coenzyme A-cholesterol transferase activity, reducing cholesterol ester accumulation within cells. Fenofibrate significantly increases the fractional rate of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in normolipidemic and hypercholesterolemic patients. This may explain the increase in cholesterol ester levels observed in high-density lipoproteins. It may stimulate bile acid synthesis from exogenous cholesterol. It causes a marked reduction of increased spontaneous platelet aggregation. Fenofibrate also markedly diminishes the effect of platelet-derived growth factor upon DNA synthesis in vitro, an effect that might impede a key event in early atherogenesis. Thus, fenofibrate has effects not directly related to its lipid- and lipoprotein-lowering action.\r"

This may favor liquid crystal formation, and fenofibrate may have less propensity to cause gallstones than would other derivatives. Many other factors are also important in determining whether supersaturated bile will result in gallstone formation, and the use of this compound should be monitored in the future to determine the clinical importance of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "The literature for the last seven years was reviewed in terms of the effect of the various fibric acid derivatives on blood lipid and lipoprotein levels. The criteria for review resulted in a greater focus on three of the newer fibric acid derivatives: bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate. In type II A hyperlipoproteinemia, all fibric acid derivatives produce modest reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The evidence suggests that bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and fenofibrate may produce greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those usually observed with clofibrate and gemfibrozil. All fibric acid derivatives produce modest reductions in triglycerides and modest increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in type II A hyperlipoproteinemia. In type II B hyperlipoproteinemia, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effect of fibric acid derivatives is generally less than that observed in type II A hyperlipoproteinemia. In type II B hyperlipoproteinemia, there is a mean decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for all patients studied. However, there is a considerable interpatient variation ranging from significant decreases to significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Further studies are required to assess whether the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effect is greater with the newer fibric acid derivatives. All fibric acid derivatives produce clinically significant decreases in triglyceride levels in type II B. There is also an associated increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In type IV hyperlipoproteinemia, all fibric acid derivatives produce clinically significant reductions in triglyceride. There is also an associated increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and generally also an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The available data do not suggest a clinically significant difference in the hypotriglyceridemic effect of the various fibric acid derivatives in type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. The lipid-altering effects of the various fibric acid derivatives were usually less in those studies that contained placebo and dietary controls. Additional controlled clinical trials are needed to accurately discriminate the relative lipid-and lipoprotein-altering effects of the various fibric acid derivatives.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the lipoprotein effect of fenofibrate in hypercholesterolemia or combined hyperlipidemia (types II A and II B hyperlipidemias, respectively), 240 patients were recruited and 227 randomized to a double-blind randomized trial lasting 24 weeks and 192 patients continued to participate in an open-label phase for another 24 weeks. A 100-mg dose of fenofibrate or a matching placebo was given three times daily. Fenofibrate side effects in excess of placebo affected 6 percent of fenofibrate users and were confined almost entirely to skin rashes. In 180 hypercholesterolemic patients randomly assigned to receive fenofibrate versus placebo, triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 38 percent, total cholesterol levels decreased 17.5 percent, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 20.3 percent with fenofibrate treatment. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 11.1 percent with a decrease in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio of 27 percent. All differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). In combined hyperlipidemic (type II B) patients, triglyceride levels decreased by 45 percent, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 52.7 percent, total cholesterol levels decreased 16 percent, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 6 percent, and high-density lipoprotein levels increased 15.3 percent for a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decrease of 13 percent. All differences were again statistically significant (p less than 0.01). In both groups of patients, the onset of the drug effect was generally rapid, with maximal total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level lowering achieved within four weeks in hypercholesterolemic patients and maximal triglyceride and cholesterol level lowering in hypertriglyceridemic patients achieved in two weeks. Maximum high-density lipoprotein increases occurred after four weeks in type II A patients and 12 to 16 weeks in type II B patients. Fenofibrate is a well-tolerated drug in the fibric acid series and has putatively beneficial effects on triglyceride, very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in both type II A and type II B hyperlipidemic patients. If the lipid hypothesis of atherosclerosis applies to the lipoprotein changes induced by fenofibrate, reductions in cardiovascular disease risk in both type II A and II B hyperlipidemic patients should result from fenofibrate treatment.\r"

Eleven men and 10 women aged 29 to 63 were studied, 12 with type II A and nine with type II B hyperlipoproteinemia. Fasting blood samples were obtained every four to six weeks. Lipoprotein lipids were quantified by procedures of the Lipid Research Clinics, and apolipoproteins by radioimmunoassay. Fenofibrate decreased mean triglyceride and cholesterol levels of the type II A patients from 130 to 99 and from 286 to 237 mg/dl, respectively. Levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels rose. Apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein E levels decreased, whereas apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein AII levels rose. The mean very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride ratio and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:low-density lipoprotein triglyceride ratio decreased. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:apolipoprotein B ratio and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: apolipoprotein AII ratio decreased as did the apolipoprotein AI:apolipoprotein AII ratio. In patients with type II B hyperlipoproteinemia, triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased with fenofibrate therapy with most of the decrease in triglyceride levels due to very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, whereas the decrease in total cholesterol levels was due to decreases in very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels rose. The decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was not significant in this group. Apolipoprotein E levels decreased and apoliprotein AI and apolipoprotein AII levels rose. Indices of composition in type II B patients were similar to those in type II A patients but the changes were less dramatic. Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride ratios decreased significantly, but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:low-density lipoprotein triglyceride ratios did not change significantly with treatment. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:apolipoprotein B ratio, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol:apolipoprotein AII ratio, and apolipoprotein AI:apolipoprotein AII ratio all were lowered by therapy. Thus, very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein lost cholesterol in response to fenofibrate therapy and high-density lipoprotein particles became enriched in cholesterol.\r"

These agents may also reduce the hepatic secretion of nascent very low-density lipoprotein, but this effect is less consistent. Effects on low-density lipoprotein metabolism appear to depend upon the lipid disorder present before therapy. If hypertriglyceridemia and normal or low low-density lipoprotein levels are present, fibrate therapy is associated with a rise in low-density lipoprotein levels. This is due to a decreased fractional catabolism of low-density lipoprotein from an unusually high clearance to a more normal value. Treating pre-existing hypercholesterolemia usually results in a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein levels. In this disorder, there is a demonstrable increase in low-density lipoprotein receptor-mediated clearance. It is not known at which site these drugs act to increase low-density lipoprotein receptor function in the latter patients. Some studies suggest that fibrate therapy increases high-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein AI production, but how this occurs has not been defined.\r"

  ".W": "The major effect of the fibrates on triglycerides is to promote triglyceride-rich lipoprotein catabolism through increased lipoprotein lipase activity. Fibrates also enhance lipolysis of plasma triglycerides by a means different from that of caloric restriction. Their effect on very low-density lipoprotein metabolism also differs from that of nicotinic acid. The effect of fibrate therapy upon low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations depends upon the patients' overall lipoprotein status. The responsible mechanisms are not understood. In hypertriglyceridemic patients, fibrates often reverse abnormal changes in low-density lipoprotein composition; low-density lipoprotein heterogeneity is reduced and small dense low-density lipoproteins are eliminated, apparently secondary to reduced levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Kinetic studies indicate that fibrates do not enhance low-density lipoprotein formation rates, thus contradicting the idea that fibrate therapy causes increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels via increased conversion of very low-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein. Though enhanced low-density lipoprotein catabolism in hypertriglyceridemia could occur via several mechanisms, the responsible factors are largely reversed by fibrate therapy. In non-hypertriglyceridemic patients, fibrates may actually enhance the fractional clearance of low-density lipoprotein and thus reduce low-density lipoprotein levels. Fibrate therapy reverses the typical high-density lipoprotein pattern of hypertriglyceridemic patients, producing more high-density lipoprotein2a and less high-density lipoprotein2b. Such treatment also increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients without definite hypertriglyceridemia. Synthesis rates of apolipoproteins AI and AII may be affected by fibrates. The fibrates' major effects on sterol metabolism are interference with cholesterol and bile acid synthesis and increased cholesterol secretion into bile. Although bile saturation increases in most patients, in only a relatively small percentage do gallstones actually develop; super-saturated bile is not sufficient to induce gallstone formation in most patients. Available data strongly imply that fibrates mobilized cholesterol out of tissue pools, perhaps by altering tissue cell membranes to allow cholesterol release from the cell surfaces.\r"

The end-point measure of the study was birth weight related to gestational age. Results obtained in the treatment group were compared with those in 27 pregnancies of a control group of 24 multigravid women with a similar history of recurrent fetal growth retardation who received comparable antenatal care without low dose aspirin and dipyridamole. Fetal growth retardation occurred in 61% of the control pregnancies and in only 13% of treated pregnancies; severe fetal growth retardation was not observed in treated pregnancies, but it occurred in 27% of the control group. In treated women, platelet cyclo-oxygenase activity was suppressed to 5% to 10% of its pretreatment level, but no effect on vascular prostacyclin production was demonstrated. Treatment did not produce adverse effects in mothers or infants.

  ".W": "Insulin concentrations, in response to an intravenous glucose bolus after a 24-hour fast, have been studied in female rhesus monkeys in which the circulating levels of androstenedione and testosterone or estrone and estradiol have been increased for as long as 4 1/2 years. No significant differences were observed in the basal insulin or C-peptide concentrations in the androgen or estrogen-treated animals compared with each other or with normal cycling, nontreated control animals. The insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose were similar in control and androgen-treated monkeys. Compared with both the control and androgen-treated monkeys, the responses of the estrogen-treated monkeys tended to be lower but were not significantly different. The glucose disappearance rate after the intravenous glucose bolus was not significantly different in androgen and control monkeys but was significantly slower during the initial 30 minutes in the estrogen-treated monkeys compared with both the control and androgen-treated monkeys. These studies suggest that chronically elevated androgen levels in the mature female subhuman primate do not lead to insulin resistance or overt glucose intolerance.\r"

  ".U": "88074559\r", 
  ".W": "Recent progress in our understanding of uterine smooth muscle contraction is reviewed. We no longer believe that actin-myosin interaction in the myometrium occurs through activation of the thin filament; but it is triggered by calcium-dependent phosphorylation of myosin in the thick filament. Calcium is now thought to originate from both extracellular and intracellular sources. Calcium can enter the cell through either a voltage- or a hormone-controlled calcium channel. The intracellular source of calcium is the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of oxytocin in human labor is no longer considered the result of increased circulating oxytocin but rather of increased oxytocin receptors. In contrast, the contractile action of some prostaglandins is related to increased prostaglandin formation at human parturition. The step between hormone binding and cellular action is mediated by second messengers. The uterine-relaxing action of cyclic adenosine monophosphate is now thought to be limited to the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation. Recently discovered second messengers for contraction of the myometrium are phosphoinositides; their turnover causes calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Guanine nucleotides are thought to be modulators of these two second messengers.\r"

  ".W": "We used immunoperoxidase staining and double immunofluorescent staining to demonstrate the macromolecular components of the extracellular matrix of the lamina cribrosa from young human donors. The cribriform plates were made up of a core of elastin fibers with a sparse, patchy distribution of collagen type III. The plates were coated with collagen type IV and laminin; these basement membrane components were presumably made by the astrocytes that were distributed on the surfaces of the plates. The insertion of the lamina cribrosa in the sclera was made up of concentric, circumferential elastin fibers that surrounded the lamina cribrosa and were continuous with the elastin in the cribriform plates. Astrocytic processes extended into the bundles of elastin fibers, whereas the basement membrane components extended into the sclera. The mechanical properties of the macromolecules of the extracellular matrix of the lamina cribrosa may make this tissue compliant and sensitive to intraocular pressure. Perhaps individual differences in the macromolecular components of this tissue contribute to the glaucomatous changes in the optic nerve head.\r"

Heart parasitism and a variable degree of inflammation occurred following infection with clones X10/4 or M/78 but not with M/80. Clone X10/4 caused more extensive myocardial inflammation and fibrosis than clone M/78. Myocardial fibrosis was more extensive in C3H than in C57 mice infected with clone X10/4. The normal ECG pattern of C3H mice is distinctly different from C57 mice. The PR intervals of mice infected with clone X10/4 greater than M/78 greater than M/80 approximately equal to controls. ECG abnormalities occurred more frequently in mice infected with clone X10/4 than in controls or mice infected with either M/78 or M/80 regardless of strain or sex and were generally more severe in C57 than in C3H infected with X10/4. First degree atrioventricular block occurred more frequently in C3H mice infected with clone X10/4 or M/78 and C57 mice infected with X10/4 than in all other groups. Complete atrioventricular dissociation occurred frequently in C57 mice infected with X10/4 and rarely in other mice. These results demonstrate that the myocardial response of mice to T. cruzi infection, both histological and electrophysiological, is modulated by both the mouse strain and the parasite isolate used.\r"

Eighty-five C. musculinus were inoculated intranasally at birth with 100 TCID50 of Cba An 9446 strain of Junin virus and observed for 480 days. No clinical signs of neurologic illness were registered. Infected animals showed an increased mortality rate of up to 70% between days 24-40 post-infection. This period of high mortality was preceded by low weight gain during lactation and registered until 60 days. From day 14 post-infection until day 480, Junin virus was recovered from blood, urine, and oral swab in all animals checked at any time. By day 480 post-infection, 100% of survivors showed widespread viral dissemination in brain, spleen, kidneys, and salivary glands. There was marked reduction in reproductive efficiency among infected animals. Out of 15 mating pairs, 2 (13.3%) littered at least once compared to 60% in the control group. The reduction of fertility and the altered survival rate of Junin virus-infected C. musculinus indicate that vertical transmission mechanisms per se are insufficient to maintain the infection in successive generations in the absence of horizontal transmission.\r"

Extensive field and laboratory studies done since 1945 in the Central Valley of California have more clearly defined the specific invertebrate and vertebrate hosts involved in the basic virus transmission cycle, but the overall concept remains unchanged. The basic transmission cycle involves Culex tarsalis as the primary vector mosquito species and house finches and house sparrows as the primary amplifying hosts. Secondary amplifying hosts, upon which Cx. tarsalis frequently feeds, include other passerine species, chickens, and possibly pheasants in areas where they are abundant. Another transmission cycle that most likely is initiated from the Cx. tarsalis-wild bird cycle involves Aedes melanimon and the blacktail jackrabbit. Like humans and horses, California ground squirrels, western tree squirrels, and a few other wild mammal species become infected tangentially with the virus but do not contribute significantly to virus amplification.\r"

This view is examined in the light of epidemic activity during the last decade (1977-1986), in which 9 discrete outbreaks occurred. In addition, 5 interactive factors (virus, vector, viremic host, human immunity, environmental temperature) described by Reeves as essential to the development of an SLE epidemic are reviewed in the light of recent research. Although much progress has been achieved, many questions remain about SLE epidemiology and ecology. Among the most important are: Do Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes play a significant role in SLE virus transmission in the western United States? Is there a sylvatic cycle of SLE virus transmission in the east-central United States? What are the most sensitive and specific predictors of SLE virus activity in the east-central United States? What are the overwintering mechanisms which assure SLE virus recrudescence, and what role does transovarial transmission of virus play?\r"

  ".W": "The California serogroup viruses are important human pathogens, originally discovered in the United States, but now recognized to occur and cause disease in many parts of the world. In addition to their significance to public health, study of their natural history has resulted in a better understanding of the way in which arboviruses are maintained in nature. Viruses of the California serogroup have also been carefully investigated on the molecular level, resulting in a better appreciation of how viruses are constructed, organized, and replicate. William C. Reeves, in whose honor this symposium is held, has contributed throughout his career to each of these fields of endeavor. His pioneering work on these viruses, beginning with the discovery of the prototype California encephalitis virus, has helped to establish the foundations upon which our current understanding of these viruses is built.\r"

At present, the mechanism by which mosquito-borne alphaviruses pass the winter is obscure.\r"

Methods of prediction of outbreaks remain imprecise, although our understanding of sources of variation associated with indicators used for prediction is improving. Well organized and funded systematic mosquito abatement remains the most effective method of prevention of human cases of mosquito-borne virus disease, although emergency methods must be employed when outbreaks are imminent. The development of information management systems technology, use of recent developments of sampling theory, and research on vector competency and related areas should permit much better precision in estimates of impending outbreaks.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral analgesic effects of opiates were evaluated in a rat model of inflammation. The experimental design excluded a potential central nervous system site of action for the observed analgesia. After the injection of carrageenan (CARRA) in the plantar surface of both hind paws, an opiate was injected into one paw and saline was injected into the other paw. The inflamed paws injected with the mu-agonist, fentanyl (0.3 micrograms) or the kappa-agonist, ethylketocyclazocine (10 micrograms) were significantly less hyperalgesic (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively) than were the contralateral inflamed paws injected with saline. At these doses, fentanyl and ethylketocyclazocine were devoid of systemic effects. Another mu-agonist, levorphanol (20, 40, 80, or 160 micrograms) and dextrorphan (160 micrograms), its dextrorotatory isomer, were used next to evaluate opioid specificity. Levorphanol produced a dose-related blockade of CARRA-induced hyperalgesia (P less than 0.005). In contrast, 160 micrograms of dextrorphan was inactive. These results demonstrate that local administration of opiates into an inflamed paw produces a dose-related, stereospecific analgesia restricted to the injected area.\r"

Patients received either fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg (F group; n = 142), low-dose nalbuphine 300 micrograms/kg (LN group; N = 103), or high-dose nalbuphine 500 micrograms/kg (HN group; n = 41), intravenously (IV) before anesthesia consisting of thiopental, N2O, O2, and a succinylcholine infusion. Additional IV intraoperative and IM postoperative opioids were given if required for signs of inadequate anesthesia or postoperative pain. The patients' clinical and psychological status was evaluated at 20-min intervals postoperatively by a team of trained interviewers. The low- and high-dose nalbuphine groups clinically resembled the fentanyl group in terms of dosing frequency and patients' self-ratings of postoperative analgesia. Length of stay and postoperative sedation were significantly greater with nalbuphine. The incidence of psychological side effects, including dreaming and postoperative anxiety, was also greater with nalbuphine. However, patient acceptance of nalbuphine was high and was similar to that observed in patients given fentanyl.\r"

The specificity of IV DSA was 95% and the sensitivity for ICA stenosis of 50% or more and ICA occlusion were 75% and 100% respectively. Combining CW Doppler and IV DSA findings raised sensitivity for ICA stenosis of 50% or more and ICA occlusion to 89% and 100% respectively and specificity to 95%.

Significant improvement in peak flow rate (P less than .04) was noted after the second inhalation of metaproterenol both with and without the combination of atropine sulfate compared with the effects of atropine alone. Patients treated with metaproterenol and metaproterenol combined with atropine also experienced fewer therapeutic failures (2/15 and 2/16, respectively) compared with those treated with atropine (6/13, P less than .02). Pulmonary index scores did not differ among the treatment groups. Inhaled metaproterenol appears to be more effective than inhaled atropine sulfate in the treatment of children with acute asthma.

The clinical symptoms often resemble allergy and consist of anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, urticaria, angioedema, and various skin eruptions. Patients with asthma or urticaria are particularly prone to these reactions. In about 10% of adult asthmatics, aspirin and several other NSAID precipitate open asthmatic attacks, most likely through inhibition of cyclooxygenase. This distinct clinical syndrome has a characteristic sequence of symptoms and clinical course. In 20% to 40% of patients with active urticaria, aspirin increases wheals and swelling. Pyrazolones might provoke two different types of clinical reactions, acting as allergens or interfering pharmacologically with cyclooxygenation of arachidonic acid. Other mechanisms might operate in some of the remaining adverse reactions to NSAID. Emerging clinical syndromes help to guide the clinicians through the maze of symptoms and often provide a unique insight into the mechanism of basic disease.\r"

The maintenance of the physiologic integrity of the mucosa is complex and depends largely on local immune responses. The physiologic processes of the body are integrated and carefully regulated so that no single event can be considered in the absence of consideration of its interaction with its environment. These principles are perhaps best demonstrated by the models and concepts emerging to explain the apparent idiosyncrasies of the mucosal immune system. How these can be harnessed to promote protection and how they may be manipulated to prevent disease is the subject of extensive current investigation which we have attempted to summarize in this brief review.\r"

  ".W": "Two decades ago it was shown that the major immunoglobulin (Ig) present in human secretions is a dimeric IgA covalently bound to an epithelial glycoprotein of about 80 kD, now called the secretory component (SC). Pentameric IgM is likewise actively enriched in most exocrine fluids and is associated with SC, although not in a covalently stabilized complex. Three findings explain the selective translocation of polymeric Ig (pIg) into exocrine fluids: (1) preferential local production; (2) J-chain-expressing capacity of pIg-producing immunocytes; and (3) SC-mediated epithelial transport. Human hepatocytes lack SC and the human liver, therefore, cannot act as an efficient \"IgA pump\". This is in contrast to the rat liver which shows a remarkable capacity for transport of dimeric IgA from blood into the bile. The J chain of pIg and the epithelial SC represent the \"lock and key\" in the glandular transport of secretory IgA (SIgA) and SIgM. It has recently been shown that SC is synthesized as a transmembrane protein of about 95 kD and constitutes the actual pIg surface receptor. Complexing between ligand and receptor in the plasma membrane is followed by endocytosis. The completed SIgA and SIgM molecules are then translocated in cytoplasmic vesicles through the epithelial cell to the gland lumen along with an excess of free SC. The main function of SIgA is to exert immune exclusion; that is, by intimate cooperation with innate nonspecific defense factors it decreases penetration of soluble antigens and inhibits epithelial colonization of bacteria and viruses. Especially in selective IgA deficiency, SIgM may exert a similar protective function since its synthesis is markedly increased in the intestinal mucosa. Leakage of IgG into exocrine fluids is enhanced by mucosal irritation. Although IgG should not be considered as a SIg, it may contribute to immune exclusion. This is seen especially in the respiratory tract where IgG is less easily subjected to proteolytic degradation than in the intestinal juice. In contrast, by activating complement, IgG antibodies may at the same time be phlogistic and accelerate mucosal penetration of antigens. IgG may thus contribute to persistent immunopathology in mucosal disease. The same is true for IgE antibodies which may be carried into mucous membranes and secretions by mast cells and cause their degranulation with local histamine release. Traces of IgD may likewise be found in the secretions but without obvious biologic significance. Regulation of secretory immunity takes place both in organized lymphoepithelial structures, such as the Peyer's patches, and adjacent to the glands in the lamina propria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The prominence of mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract and the potential effects of newly generated and preformed mediators released by stimulated mast cells on surrounding gastrointestinal tissues have raised important questions regarding the role of the mast cell in both physiologic and pathophysiologic events in the gut. The elucidation of the role of the mast cell in the gastrointestinal tract is a complex task as illustrated by studies revealing the presence of heterogeneous populations of mast cells in this organ. Morphologic, biochemical, and functional differences have been demonstrated between mast cells located primarily in the mucosa (atypical or mucosal mast cells) and mast cells distributed throughout the connective tissues of the gut (typical or connective tissue mast cells). Awareness of the distinguishing features of mast cell populations in the gut is an important step in unraveling the functional role of gastrointestinal mast cells and may lead to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to gastrointestinal diseases in which mast cell activation occurs.\r"

Oral ingestion of a bacterial antigen by volunteers led to the parallel appearance of secretory IgA antibodies in several external secretions that was preceded by a transitory detection of IgA antibody-secreting cells in the peripheral blood. Naturally occurring secretory and serum IgA antibodies as well as secretory and serum antibodies induced by mucosal immunization belong predominantly to the IgA1 subclass; however, in external secretions IgA2 is the predominant subclass of natural antibodies to endotoxin and lipoteichoic acid. Although in external secretions specific IgA antibodies are of polymeric form, serum IgA antibodies to different antigens display considerable variability with respect to their distribution in polymeric and monomeric forms. However, after experimental infection, serum IgA antibodies to the influenza virus hemagglutinin are almost exclusively polymeric.\r"

  ".W": "An important adaptation of the gastrointestinal tract to the extrauterine environment is its development of a mucosal barrier against the penetration of proteins and protein fragments. To combat the potential danger of invasion across the mucosal barrier, the infant must develop within the lumen and on the luminal mucosal surface an elaborate system of defense mechanisms that act to control and maintain the epithelium as an impermeable barrier to the uptake of macromolecular antigens. These defenses include a unique local immunologic system adapted to function in the complicated milieu of the intestine as well as other nonimmunologic processes such as a gastric barrier, intestinal surface secretions, peristaltic movement, etc, all of which help to provide maximum protection for the intestinal surface. Unfortunately, during the immediate postpartum period, especially for premature and \"small-for-date\" infants, this elaborate local defense system is incompletely developed. As a result of the delay in the maturation of the mucosal barrier, newborn infants are particularly vulnerable to pathologic penetration by harmful intraluminal substances. The consequences of altered defense are susceptibility to infection and the potential for hypersensitivity reactions and the formation of immune complexes. With these reactions comes the potential for developing life-threatening diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and hepatitis. Fortunately, nature has provided a means for passively protecting the \"vulnerable\" newborn against the dangers of a deficient intestinal defense system: human milk. It is now increasingly apparent that human milk contains not only antibodies and viable leukocytes, but many other substances that can interfere with bacterial colonization and prevent antigen penetration.\r"

For each exposure, subjects took either vitamin C (500 mg 4 times a day for 3 days) or placebo followed by exposure either to clean air or to 2.0 ppm NO2. Measurements of lung mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine aerosol were obtained. Serum level of ascorbic acid was determined before each exposure. NO2 exposure with placebo resulted in significant enhancement of airway responsiveness to methacholine aerosol (air-placebo 64 +/- 7 to NO2-placebo 53 +/- 8 mg/ml). Pretreatment with ascorbic acid prevented the significant alteration in airway responsiveness to methacholine aerosol (65 +/- 13 mg/ml, p less than 0.04). These results suggest that airway hyperresponsiveness induced by NO2 in normal subjects is completely prevented by pretreatment with ascorbic acid.\r"

Subjects underwent a standard methacholine challenge test. There was a strong linear relationship between percent decline FEV1 and cumulative dose methacholine. We summarized each dose-response curve by the slope of a line extending from the origin to the last data point obtained. This summary dose-response slope effectively separated asthmatic from normal subjects, and there was a greater than 3,000-fold difference between the least and most responsive subjects. There was a high degree of correlation between the dose-response slope determined by the standard methacholine challenge protocol and that determined by an abbreviated protocol currently being used to examine nonspecific airway responsiveness in a large, longitudinal study of aging. Among the participants of the latter study, there is a unimodal, skewed distribution of dose-response slope. Dose-response slope is proposed as a quantitative measure of nonspecific airway responsiveness that avoids censoring and that may be particularly useful in epidemiologic studies.\r"

However, no information is available on the shape of the obtained dose-response curve, and it is not known if a plateau of response is reached. We investigated this problem in 13 adult asthmatic subjects (PC20 methacholine results varying from 0.04 to 15.2 mg/ml), 5 normal and 2 former asthmatic individuals (PC20 greater than 8 mg/ml). Inhalation dose-response curves were drawn by asking the subjects to inhale dry cold air (-20 degrees C) for 3 min at progressively increasing degrees of ventilation (5, 10, 15, 20, etc., L/min) until maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) or sufficient bronchoconstriction was reached. FEV1 was assessed after each degree until no further decline was seen. No functional recovery was observed before asking the subject to inhale the next dose of cold air. Maximal falls in FEV1 ranged from 20.7 to 56.5% in the current asthmatic subjects, whereas no significant (less than 10%) changes in FEV1 were obtained in the normal and former asthmatic individuals. Seven to 13 points on the individual dose-response curves were obtained for each current asthmatic subject. Curves were analyzed using the common pharmacologic logistic model. The coefficients of correlation were, in general, highly statistically significant. Curves obtained for the current asthmatic subjects represented a truncated sigmoidal pattern without a plateau. Curves were flat in the normal and former asthmatic individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nerve fibers containing neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/peptide histidine isoleucine, substance P/neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), and galanin are numerous in the respiratory tract. The fibers derive from several different ganglia such as the superior cervical and stellate ganglia, the jugular-nodose ganglionic complex, small ganglia along the vagus nerve, local ganglionic formations in the tracheal wall, and dorsal root ganglia at the cervical and thoracic level. The fibers surround vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle and seromucous glands and can be seen beneath the surface epithelium. In addition, nerve fibers containing substance P/NKA and CGRP penetrate into the surface epithelium. In some instances, neuropeptides are colocalized with \"classic\" neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and acetylcholine; in other cases, several peptides coexist. Many of the neuropeptides affect blood flow, smooth muscle tone, and/or seromucous secretion. Some of them may take part in reflex-mediated responses. However, the lack of specific antagonists makes it difficult to define their functional role in the respiratory tract.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary immunologic responses may be mediated and modulated in part by neuropeptides released from the endings of nerve fibers that innervate the airways. Bronchoconstriction, mucosal edema, and increased airway secretions may be mediated by multiple locally generated neuropeptides. The neuropeptides affect directly and indirectly through other mediators the functions of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, blood vessels, and leukocytes. The high content of diverse potent neuropeptides in the ganglionated plexuses close to pulmonary smooth muscle bundles, along blood vessels, and in neural projections into the bronchial epithelium and regions containing acini of mucus glands provide tissue concentrations well within the range required to attain such biologic effects. The airway responses mediated principally by neuropeptides exhibit unique mechanisms of specificity attributable to the selective distribution of each neuropeptide in a distinct subset of nerve fibers that react differently to each stimulus and to the target cell specificity of the neuropeptides. At physiologically relevant in vitro concentrations, many of the neuropeptides have different effects on mast cells, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The direct actions of substance P (SP) and the capacity to initiate and modulate leukocyte responses are described in relation to the physiologic and pathopharmacologic consequences of pulmonary nerve stimulation. Selected cellular and molecular characteristics of the interactions of SP with mast cells, basophils, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells also will be presented in order to define the functionally critical properties of receptors for the neuropeptide and to expose possible means of specifically modifying the interactions.\r"

The effects varied according to the neuropeptide added or the tissue from which the lymphocytes were obtained. Substance P caused the most pronounced enhancement of both functions, especially in Peyer's patch cells, where it selectively increased IgA synthesis. Somatostatin was inhibitory, and the effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide varied according to the source of the cells. We have previously shown that neuropeptides also cause mast cell secretion and that only substance P was effective in this regard on intestinal mucosal mast cells. Therefore, we looked for microanatomic relationships between peptidergic nerves and immune effector cells. Mast cells appear to have structural associations with neuropeptides-containing nerves in the intestine. Nerve growth factor, known to promote the growth of sensory afferent and sympathetic nerves, has significant direct effects on mast cells. In vitro, this substance caused enhanced antigen mediated histamine release and, in vivo, extensive mast cell hyperplasia. Also, in humans, we were able to produce increased numbers of mast cell/basophil colonies from peripheral blood in the presence of nerve growth factor.\r"

Many of these are neuropeptides acting as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators to influence airway, pulmonary vascular, and other functions. More neuropeptides are known to exist in the brain and peripheral nervous system; at least some of these are soon likely to be identified in the lung. With the accelerated pace of research, the coming few years should see an increasing definition of the role of neuropeptides in lung physiology and pathophysiology, as well as in improved management of certain respiratory disorders.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied effects of several neuropeptides perfusing the cranial tracheal arteries bilaterally in anesthetized dogs. All the neuropeptides tested produced dose-related changes in vascular resistance. Substance P and VIP had similar potencies in decreasing tracheal vascular resistance. Neurokinin A (NKA) was the most potent dilator. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) were about 10 and 100 times less potent than NKA, respectively. Neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) was one of the few constrictors of tracheal vessels at doses above 10(-11) mol. There seemed to be major differences between the neuropeptides with regard to the onset and duration of their vascular effects. NKA and PHI usually caused maximal vasodilatation within 15 to 30 s after the injection into the tracheal artery, and their vascular responses subsided within 1 to 2 min. With CGRP, the maximal dilatation of tracheal vessels came somewhat later, and more than half of the vascular response was still present 10 min after the injection of this neuropeptide. The maximal vasoconstrictor response to NPY came slowly, and the constriction showed only a little tendency to subside within 10 min after the injection. These results indicate that the long-acting neuropeptides VIP, CGRP, and NPY may be more important than the short-acting NKA and PHI in the physiologic regulation of airway blood flow. All the neuropeptides studied had effects on the contralateral tracheal vascular resistance. They were much more powerful than the classic mediators histamine and methacholine.\r"

There is mounting evidence that they may act as neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves and may be co-transmitters of classic autonomic nerves. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and the related peptide histidine methionine are potent relaxants of human airways in vitro, yet their effects in vivo are disappointing because of problems in delivery. Sensory neuropeptides such as substance P, neurokinins A and B, and calcitonin gene-related peptide may be involved in neurogenic inflammatory reactions in asthma. Although there have been no clinical benefits from these discoveries, in the future the development of agents that interfere with or mimic neuropeptide effects may offer novel therapeutic approaches to airway diseases such as asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Regulatory peptides are synthesized in their cells of origin as large, usually inactive, precursors. The gene sequences encoding many peptides are now known. Although these indicate the primary structure of the precursor, it remains necessary to define the actual peptide products of cells expressing a particular gene. In several instances, e.g., calcitonin gene-related peptide and preprotachykinin, it is known that there are alternative mRNA splicing mechanisms that generate different precursor molecules. Post-translational processing converts the precursor to smaller active products by cleavage of the chain and by modification to individual residues. The pathways of post-translational processing of the precursors may conveniently be studied using immunochemical methods. These allow detection of products that vary in chain length, or are modified by sulphation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, amidation, or N-terminal acetylation. Patterns of post-translational processing are commonly different between cells expressing the same gene. There are frequently, therefore, multiple active products that can be generated from a precursor, both within a single cell and in different cells expressing the same regulatory peptide gene. Examples are given to indicate the physiologic importance of these mechanisms and how they can be studied.\r"

Design: Randomized trial with intermittent interferon administration to day 80 after transplantation. Setting: Marrow transplantation units of a cancer research center. Patients: Consecutive patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission at the time of transplantation. Thirty-nine patients received interferon, and 40 were control patients. Interventions: Partially purified human leukocyte interferon given every 3 days beginning after marrow engraftment and continuing to day 80 after transplantation. After initial safety testing, the starting and minimum dose was 6 X 10(4) units/kg of body weight, with dose escalations determined by the circulating neutrophil count. Transplant conditioning and post-transplantation prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease with methotrexate followed standard procedures. Measurements and Main Results: No difference was observed in the probability or severity of cytomegalovirus infection or in the probability or severity of graft-versus-host disease. Relapse of leukemia occurred in 9 interferon recipients and 21 control patients, with a minimum follow-up of 4 years among surviving patients. The probability of relapse among all interferon recipients was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.56 to 0.17) and among all control patients was 0.74 (95% Cl, 0.91 to 0.58) (p = 0.04 by log-rank test). Among patients who received transplants in first or second remission, the probability of relapse among interferon recipients was 0.19 (95% Cl, 0.37 to 0.02) compared with 0.71 (95% Cl, 0.97 to 0.51) among control patients (p = 0.008 by log-rank test). Survival rates did not differ between interferon recipients and control patients. Transient decreases in leukocyte count and anorexia and nausea occurred among interferon recipients. Six interferon recipients, all of whom had received chemoradiotherapy of the central nervous system before transplantation, developed leukoencephalopathy after transplantation. Conclusions: These data suggest that interferon given after transplantation reduces the risk for subsequent relapse of leukemia. The effect of longer administration and of administration in patients with other underlying diseases will require additional trials. No effect was observed on cytomegalovirus infection, either because interferon was not initiated until a median of 18 days after transplantation or because of a lesser effect among marrow allograft recipients.\r"

One hundred thirty hospitalized patients, 23 of whom were excluded. Of the remaining 107 patients, 52 (group I) were already using antibiotics at the time of randomization for gastrostomy, whereas 55 (group II) were not. Interventions. Patients received either intravenous saline as a placebo or intravenous cefazolin (1 g) 30 minutes before gastrostomy. Measurements and Main Results. For 1 week after gastrostomy, the peristomal area was evaluated and a score assigned each day for erythema (0 to 4), induration (0 to 3), and exudate (0 to 4). A maximum combined score of 8 or more or the development of pus was a criterion for infection. None of the patients in group I developed a wound infection. Only 2 of 27 group II patients given prophylaxis developed a wound infection, compared with 9 of 28 patients not given prophylaxis, a difference of 25% (95% confidence interval, 4.8 to 44.6%; p less than 0.025). The number of patients who developed a wound infection was 0 of 52 in group I and 2 of 27 in group II patients who received cefazolin, a difference of 7.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.5 to 17.3%; p = 0.07). Conclusion. Cefazolin prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk for peristomal wound infection associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. It is needed, however, only for patients not already receiving antibiotic treatment at the time of gastrostomy.\r"

The drug's availability in topical, oral, and intravenous preparations has allowed its use in a range of clinical situations. Acyclovir must be phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase in infected cells, where it then acts to inhibit viral DNA replication specifically. Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus infections do not seem to respond to acyclovir therapy, although in-vitro effects on these viruses may be seen. Acyclovir is well absorbed and distributed, with cerebrospinal fluid levels 50% that of plasma. Clearance is almost entirely by the renal route, with a half-life of 20 hours in the anuric patient. Acyclovir has an excellent safety profile, its major adverse effect being transient serum creatinine elevations during high-dose intravenous use. Major uses include treatment of primary and recurrent genital herpes and herpes encephalitis and prophyllaxis and therapy of mucocutaneous herpes and varicella-zoster infections in immunocompromised patients. Resistance to acyclovir in herpes simplex virus is rarely encountered and does not seem to be due to long-term chronic suppressive therapy.\r"

Biochemical studies indicate that increased release of norepinephrine is associated with certain symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and the severity of the withdrawal symptoms correlates positively with the amount of norepinephrine released. In the rat, the brain epinephrine concentration is reduced by alcohol, a phenomenon probably associated with both the intoxicating and rewarding effects of alcohol intake. Furthermore, intoxicating effects of alcohol can be reversed by inhibiting epinephrine synthesis in the rat brain. In this species, alcohol withdrawal is associated with profound depletion of epinephrine in the hypothalamus. When clonidine, a norepinephrine alpha-2-receptor agonist, was infused in alcoholics, these receptors were found to be subsensitive during alcohol withdrawal, and this subsensitivity may contribute to the syndrome. Repeated withdrawals may lead to \"kindling\" and thus further enhancement of noradrenergic overactivity. Pituitary responsiveness to corticotropin-releasing hormone, which is a central regulator of stress responses and increases the firing rate of brain noradrenergic neurons, is altered during alcohol withdrawal.\r"

Educational programs based on such ideas eliminate the denominationalism that has characterized psychiatry and make it more obviously a subdiscipline of medicine.\r"

To provide a more current perspective, we summarize the epidemiologic data, results of clinical studies of calcium metabolism in humans with hypertension, effects of controlled interventions of calcium supplementation in humans, and findings from laboratory studies intended to elucidate possible mechanisms. Data from the epidemiologic and clinical trials support a protective role for calcium in regulating arterial pressure. A potentially important relationship between the \"calcium hypothesis\" and \"salt-sensitivity\" may provide further insights into the mechanisms involved. Results of experiments in vascular physiology indicate that dietary calcium's effect in lowering blood pressure is mediated in part through direct action on the vasculature.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D is a hormone, not a vitamin. The skin is responsible for producing vitamin D. During exposure to sunlight, ultraviolet radiation penetrates into the epidermis and photolyzes provitamin D3 to previtamin D3. Previtamin D3 can either isomerize to vitamin D3 or be photolyzed to lymisterol and tachysterol. Vitamin D is also sensitive to sunlight and is photolyzed to 5,6-transvitamin D3, suprasterol I, and suprasterol II. In Boston, solar irradiation only produces previtamin D3 in the skin between the months of March and October. Aging, sunscreens, and melanin all diminish the capacity of the skin to produce previtamin D3. Once formed, vitamin D3 enters the circulation and is sequentially metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-[OH]2-D3). The epidermis possesses receptors for 1,25-(OH)2-D3. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 inhibits the proliferation of cultured keratinocytes and induces them to terminally differentiate. The topical or oral administration of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has proved to be effective for the treatment of psoriasis. Therefore, the skin is the site for the synthesis of vitamin D and a target tissue for its active metabolite. The successful use of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 for the treatment of psoriasis heralds a new approach for the treatment of this enigmatic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Human skin contains several proteins that could bind the hydrophobic retinoids. One is retinol-binding protein (RBP), the plasma carrier of natural vitamin A, retinol, albumin, and two specific cellular-binding proteins, one for retinol (CRBP) and one for retinoic acid (CRABP). Adequate techniques for the study of these proteins in human skin have been developed; this was considered a necessary step in the understanding of how natural and synthetic retinoids work in the skin. A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique followed by protein immunoblot analysis with an antiserum specific against RBP was developed. This technique allowed study of the binding of several natural and synthetic retinoids on the plasma carrier of natural vitamin A for the first time; it was found that only natural retinoids, including retinoic acid, bind to RBP in vitro; retinoic acid binding was found to induce major conformational changes in the protein. Isotretinoin did not bind to RBP. The technique was then used for the study of RBP in human epidermal and dermal extracts; it showed that RBP degradation with loss of binding properties for retinol occurred within the epidermis; this suggests that retinol supply is decreased within the epidermis, a fact that could be linked to cornification. A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis binding assay was developed for studying CRBPs and CRABPs in human skin cytosolic extracts. This assay is more specific and more convenient than previous ones for studying tissue extracts. The CRABP was (1) in much higher levels in normal epidermis than in normal dermis, (2) dramatically elevated in psoriatic plaques and in some retinoid-responsive dermatoses, and (3) up modulated by both topical and systemic administration of natural and synthetic retinoids. Such alterations were not observed for CRBP. From these and other observations reviewed herein, it seems that CRABP should be one of the first candidates to be carefully analyzed in the search of the cellular receptor for the mediation of the synthetic retinoids in pharmacologic effects in human skin.\r"

Both disorders present with impressive clinical manifestations involving the skin and hair. In the neonatal disease, alopecia totalis is associated with a bright red scaly total body eruption. In biotinidase deficiency, the alopecia is more patchy and the skin lesions resemble acrodermatitis enteropathica. Both disorders are complicated by recurrent episodes of life-threatening acidosis and massive ketosis.\r"

  ".W": "Protein C (PC), a 62,000-molecular weight vitamin K-dependent serine protease zymogen, is a natural anticoagulant that occurs in plasma at 4 mg/L. Activated PC inactivates clotting factors V and VIII and is also profibrinolytic. Activated PC is enhanced in its anticoagulant activity by protein S (PS), another vitamin K-dependent protein. Protein S is found in platelets and endothelial cells as well as in plasma. Inherited PC deficiency and PS deficiency have been associated with venous thrombosis. Both heterozygous PC and PS deficiency appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in some families. Homozygous PC deficiency presents as neonatal purpura fulminans and results in massive venous thrombosis of the skin and other organs within the first few days of life. Symptomatic heterozygous PC deficiency and PS deficiency have been treated with oral anticoagulants, successfully minimizing recurrence of thrombosis. Coumarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare complication of oral anticoagulant therapy usually seen within three to five days of initiation of therapy, has also been associated with heterozygous PC deficiency. The short half-life of PC (six to eight hours) compared with most of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (greater than 30 hours) is the probable reason for this paradoxical response to oral anticoagulants in some PC-deficient patients, since a transient imbalance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors may exist during initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy. Acquired deficiency of the PC pathway occurs in disseminated intravascular coagulation and possibly other diseases such as those associated with a lupus anticoagulant.\r"

Sixteen patients had solitary abscesses and seven had multiple microscopic abscesses. The median time interval from admission to diagnosis and therapy was 2 and 3 days, respectively. Origin of the abscess was determined in 22 patients, the biliary tree being the most common source. Medical therapy was successful in three patients with microabscesses but failed in two. Nine patients had percutaneous drainage; two required repetitive percutaneous catheter placement, and two proceeded to surgical drainage. Twelve patients had surgical drainage; one required repetitive surgical drainage. Postdrainage complications were minimal in all groups. Overall mortality role was 11.5% (two patients). Deaths were related to delay in diagnosis, gram-negative sepsis at presentation, and biliary origin of the abscess.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the relative incidence of appendicitis and typhlitis among patients with acute leukemia who had operation or autopsy in this institution as well as to determine the risks of operative intervention. Fifteen patients with these complications were identified among the 400 patients with acute leukemia seen during this time period. Signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen were present despite immunosuppression. The incidence of sepsis at the time of presentation was 53%. Preoperative risk factors identified most frequently were coagulopathy and organ failure resulting from sepsis. Postoperative morbidity (25%) and mortality rates (8%) were related to the development of infectious complications. Appendicitis occurred in eight of the 15 patients studied, whereas typhlitis or its complications was found in seven patients. No preoperative factors could be found to differentiate typhlitis from appendicitis on clinical examination. It is suggested that operation can be safely performed in neutropenic patients who have acute right lower quadrant pain and signs of peritoneal irritation and may be the only effective way of differentiating appendicitis from typhlitis.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasonography-guided cutting needle biopsy of the liver was performed in 186 instances on 95 different patients with carcinoid and endocrine pancreatic tumors. In 171 cases, biopsy specimens were taken from liver metastases found on ultrasonography, and in 93% of these the obtained material was adequate for a correct diagnosis. In the 7% for which an incorrect diagnosis was made, all but one biopsy specimen contained normal liver tissue, indicating that the needle-guiding technique, and not the sampling technique, is the most critical part of the biopsy procedure. Tumor specimens were examined with silver stains and immunocytochemistry after application of monoclonal serotonin antibodies. The argyrophil silver stain of Grimelius could be applied on all specimens and had positive results in all but one case, demonstrating the neurohormonal endocrine origin of the metastases. The argentaffin reaction and/or serotonin immunoreactivity could be applied in 152 cases and had positive results in 115 of 122 (94%) of the mid-gut carcinoid tumors and negative results in 27 of 28 (96.4%) of the non-mid-gut carcinoid tumors and endocrine pancreatic tumors. Major complications occurred in 1.5%; none was lethal or required surgery. The results show that the technique used for tumor biopsy is very accurate and provides material sufficient for multiple histopathologic and immunocytochemical analyses without exposing the patients to high complication risks. It is further concluded that the staining techniques and immunocytochemical analyses applied on the biopsy specimens are valid for the prediction of the location of the primary endocrine tumor.\r"

Seven patients (50%) survived and included six of 10 patients (60%) who had venorrhaphy and one in whom the portal vein was ligated. Associated injuries were present in all the patients (mean Abdominal Trauma Index: 39.5) and accounted for the high mortality rate. Follow-up data after repair or ligation of the portal vein seldom are reported in the literature. The authors studied all three patients who survived portal venorrhaphy since 1982 by real-time ultrasonography. Patency of the repair could be established in two patients. In the third patient postvenorrhaphy thrombosis was diagnosed by ultrasonographic examination. Sequential ultrasonographic examinations demonstrated resolution of the thrombus on anticoagulant therapy. Ultrasonography provides a noninvasive and easily reproducible method of studying the portal vein after repair.\r"

  ".U": "88076222\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiomyoplasty, a surgical procedure using stimulated skeletal muscle graft to replace or repair damaged myocardium, has been successfully performed in experimental animals and clinical patients. Whenever feasible, endocardium of the damaged myocardial segment is retained and partial-thickness cardiomyoplasty should be carried out. However, if this procedure were to be applied to enlarge a hypoplastic ventricle or to maintain normal dimensions of the ventricular cavity in some repairs in adults, full-thickness replacement of the ventricular wall with contractile skeletal muscle mass would be required. To develop such a technique, several canine experiments were carried out. In 7 dogs, \"simple full-thickness cardiomyoplasty\" was performed by using a latissimus dorsi muscle graft to repair a full-thickness left ventricular wall defect. We found it was difficult to obtain adequate hemostasis between the nonscarred myocardial tissue and the skeletal muscle graft, and excessive suturing to obtain hemostasis resulted in strangulation of the muscle grafts. The skeletal muscle-blood interface in the left ventricle was found to be highly thrombogenic. The perioperative hemorrhage and the risk of muscle graft strangulation by excessive sutures were avoided by using a pericardial patch as neoendocardium in 5 dogs that underwent similar full-thickness cardiomyoplasty procedures. Although the pericardial neoendocardium was not fully antithrombogenic in this canine model, endothelialization of the endocardium occurred within several weeks after operation. Thus, when combined with an implantable synchronized burst stimulator, this technique may in the future provide an effective \"full-thickness dynamic cardiomyoplasty\" to enlarge the ventricles and augment myocardial function in select patients.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord injury following operations on the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta remains a major problem. In certain subsets of patients, the risk of postoperative spinal cord injury is substantial. Although several adjuncts have been employed clinically to eliminate or reduce the frequency of this complication, none have proven to be completely effective. An important reason for this is the failure of these techniques to reliably and noninvasively localize the level of origin of arteries from the aorta that are critical to spinal cord circulation. Since postoperative spinal cord injury most likely results from ischemia or hypoxia of the lower segment of spinal cord, use of adjunctive techniques to preserve spinal cord function during aortic clamping by perfusing the distal aorta adequately with or without systemic hypothermia should be considered. To practically implement this, partial cardiopulmonary bypass for distal perfusion when the critical intercostal or lumbar arteries originate from the aorta distal to the excluded segment, and total cardiopulmonary bypass with systemic hypothermia and implantation of intercostal and lumbar arteries when these arteries originate from the excluded segment, can be used. In addition, whenever possible, intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord function should be performed.\r"

  ".W": "Gastropathy, recognized as gastric lesional disease ranging from erosions to actual ulcer craters, represents the most ubiquitous significant complication of common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (salicylate and nonsalicylate) use. Recently, this association has been established as distinct from classic peptic ulcer disease, which is primarily acid-mediated, duodenal, and more prevalent in a younger, often male, population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy is usually antral/prepyloric disease, and research indicates it is mediated through blockade of cyclooxygenase with reduction in cytoprotective gastric prostaglandins. The previous literature has been confounded with short-term studies on healthy volunteers and animals that emphasize the resiliency of normal gastric adaptation to heal such gastropathy. Newer long-term studies in patients with arthritis undergoing anti-inflammatory therapy on a sustained basis indicate fatigue of normal adaptation, with persisting gastropathy leading to bleeding and even death. In addition, silent lesions are more common as symptomatology is not synchronous with lesional disease. Since endoscopy is an expensive, not always utilized procedure, it is important to identify the population most at risk for appropriate cytoprotective management as well as modification of the anti-inflammatory therapy program.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of acute asthma, but the optimal schedule for steroid withdrawal following an asthma exacerbation has not been determined. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that tapering the corticosteroid dosage over a longer period of time reduces the number of reexacerbations. Non-steroid-dependent adult men hospitalized for asthma exacerbations during a one-year period (n = 43) were randomly assigned to corticosteroid tapering regimens of one or seven weeks, following an eight-day course of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. There were no significant differences between the long-taper and short-taper groups in rate of reexacerbation (41% vs 52%) or readmission (22% vs 21%) during the 12-week study period. Patients who did not have a reexacerbation during the 12 weeks were evaluated with spirometry, with no significant differences occurring between the two groups. More patients in the long-taper group reported corticosteroid side effects (41% vs 14%). Patients who required mechanical ventilation during the initial hospitalization (n = 7), or who reported more than two days of worse than usual dyspnea in the 12-week period (n = 20), had high rates of reexacerbation (86% and 80%, respectively). These results provide reasonable certainty (90%) that a long taper does not result in a large reduction (50% or more) in reexacerbations compared with a short taper. We conclude that the relapse rate is high in this population regardless of the corticosteroid tapering regimen used, and that a long taper does not appear to provide enough benefit to justify its routine use.\r"

After one year of psychological treatment, they were reassessed, using body weight, menstrual function, and ratings on the Morgan and Russell scales. Family therapy was found to be more effective than individual therapy in patients whose illness was not chronic and had begun before the age of 19 years. A more tentative finding was the greater value of individual supportive therapy in older patients. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial of family therapy in anorexia nervosa and clarifies the specific indications for this treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Ras oncogenes are a specific family of genes believed to play a role in malignant transformation and tumor growth in humans. To gain a better understanding of the role these oncogenes may play in malignant transformation, we evaluated the levels of a ras gene protein product (p21) in formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of normal human colonic mucosa, hyperplastic polyps, tubular adenomas, villous adenomas, and epithelium from a patient with ulcerative colitis. The p21 protein content was measured using the RAP-5 monoclonal antibody in a semiquantitative immunohistochemical assay. The titer value was expressed as the highest dilution of antibody giving definite staining using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. Differences in p21 titer values among all classes of polyps were significant (hyperplastic polyps values were less than tubular adenomas values, which were less than villous adenoma values). The p21 titers obtained from ulcerative colitis specimens were similar to those obtained from villous adenomas. We conclude that the levels of ras oncogene protein product increase with the malignant potential of benign human colonic conditions. These findings suggest that the ras oncogene protein product may play an important role in the malignant transformation of benign lesions of the human colon. If these findings are confirmed, as technology progresses to allow molecular probes to measure gene products in biopsy specimens, high-risk patients could be monitored and treated before actual malignant transformation occurs.\r"

  ".W": "The antibody response of patients was used to characterize the autoantigens in human colorectal carcinoma. Twenty-seven primary and 13 metastatic carcinomas with paired normal tissues were extracted and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by the Western transfer technique. After the transfers were incubated with the serum of the patient from whom the tumor was derived, autoantigens were identified by indirect immunoperoxidase staining. All tumors contained at least one autoantigen. Six tumor-associated autoantigens, ranging in molecular weight from 26 to 58 kilodaltons (kD), were identified by antibodies in 25% or more of the sera. Eleven metastases expressed a 41-kD autoantigen that was present in only a third of the extracts of normal liver or lung. Thus, the number of dominant polypeptide autoantigens in colorectal carcinoma is restricted to six molecules. These autoantigens may be organ-associated antigens that are expressed by neoplastic cells. The 41-kD autoantigen may be a potential marker for metastases. A generic vaccine appears to be feasible for colorectal carcinoma since the number of dominant antigens is limited.\r"

For these studies, we are using human colorectal carcinoma cells grown both in vitro and in nude mice as well as tumors obtained at surgery. Immunoperoxidase staining of human tumors indicates that laminin is present in a defined basement membrane in moderately to well-differentiated tumors. This staining pattern is absent in poorly differentiated tumors. In these tumors, staining is discontinuous and sometimes observed intracellularly. The laminin synthesized by in vitro cells was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis. Neither poorly nor well-differentiated carcinoma cells exhibit marked differences in the rate of synthesis of laminin. Differences are present in the rate at which newly synthesized laminin is secreted. These differences may result from alterations in posttranslational processing. Such alterations may contribute, along with other factors, to the inability of poorly differentiated tumors to make a basement membrane.\r"

Keratometric and refractive measurements were obtained before and at selected intervals (3, 6, 10, 26, and 52 weeks) after surgery. The number of sutures cut during the sixth week after surgery was based on the degree of astigmatism (0.00 to 2.00 diopters (D), no sutures cut; 2.25 to 3.00 D, one suture cut; 3.25 to 4.00 D, two sutures cut; greater than or equal to 4.25 D, three sutures cut). Our analysis demonstrated the following: (1) a spontaneous reduction of 0.5 D in surgically induced astigmatism in eyes without suture cutting, (2) an additional reduction of 1.2 D in postoperative astigmatism for each suture cut, and (3) attainment of 75% to 93% of the total effect of suture cutting within four weeks. The final astigmatism one year after surgery had increased by a mean of 0.9 D, exhibited predominantly with-the-rule properties, and showed no significant difference among the four groups of patients. Vector analysis revealed that only small shifts in the axis of astigmatism occurred after suture cutting. A strong correlation between the keratometric and subjective refractive measurements during all postoperative examinations indicated that corneal astigmatism is primarily responsible for postoperative astigmatism.\r"

We have reviewed the literature on drug-induced ocular pemphigoid and have added our experience with five patients with glaucoma who developed ocular cicatricial (benign mucosal) pemphigoid after treatment with various topical glaucoma medications. We also describe a case of timolol-induced ocular pemphigoid. The presentation and progression of drug-induced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid can be variable. We propose that drug-induced ocular pemphigoid represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from a self-limiting, toxic form to a progressive, immunologic form.\r"

  ".W": "A \"marking suture\" was used in 12 consecutive cases of adjustable strabismus surgery to determine the relationship between ocular alignment and the amount of horizontal muscle adjustment. The average change in ocular alignment was 2.55 prism diopters for each millimeter of muscle adjustment. Regression analysis revealed the relationship to be linear over the range of adjustments studied. The sensitivity of adjustment was the same whether the adjusted muscle was advanced or further recessed and whether the adjusted muscle was the medial rectus or the lateral rectus. No relationship was found between the distance of a recessed muscle from its normal insertion and the subsequent adjustment sensitivity of that muscle. This information, when used clinically in conjunction with a marking suture, can facilitate the adjustment phase of adjustable strabismus surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Botulinum toxin was injected into the medial rectus muscles of adult rhesus monkeys, with postinjection survival periods of three to 56 days. Light and electron microscopic changes were most apparent in the orbital, singly innervated muscle fibers, which during the acute stage (seven to 28 days), exhibited denervationlike hypertrophy with dispersion of the central mitochondria toward the periphery of the fibers. Withdrawal of the capillary network on which this fiber type normally is dependent for oxidative function was a secondary adaptive response to the disuse resulting from botulinum toxin paralysis of neuromuscular transmission. Neuromuscular junctions still were present on all muscle fiber types, although evidence of sprouting was apparent. In the long term (following return of function at 42 to 56 days), the muscle fibers appeared normal and the vasculature recovered in proportion to the decreased cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers.\r"

  ".W": "Extrusion and time-consuming surgical techniques required of implantation have been the major criticisms of quasi-integrated implants such as the Iowa Implant. With these concerns in mind, the Universal Implant (Oculo-Plastik, Montreal) has been designed to offer the motility advantages seen with quasi-integrated implants and the ease of placement of a sphere. The Universal Implant incorporates most of the advantages seen in the Iowa Implant and other quasi-integrated implants. In addition, the Universal Implant (1) utilizes a faster surgical technique for implantation; (2) avoids cleaning the muscles; (3) has lower, more rounded, smaller mounds that should decrease the late extrusion rate; (4) can be used as an enucleation implant, evisceration implant, or secondary implant; and (5) has a greater girth and larger radius of the posterior surface that helps support orbital fat and tissues, resulting in a more natural superior sulcus. Considering that the Iowa Implant is presently not available, the Universal Implant should be used by those surgeons who were pleased with the former implant and should be considered as a reasonable alternative to other enucleation implants.\r"

Immunoblot assays indicate that Me sera commonly recognize 4 peptides of molecular weights approximating 100K, 65K, 21K, and 16K. The last of these may be identical to the D peptide recognized by Sm antibodies. The Me antigen may be associated with the RNP-Sm macromolecular complex. Me-positive patients have few clinical symptoms, and the most common diagnosis is undifferentiated connective tissue disease.\r"

Rabbit antibodies to human serum albumin (anti-HSA) and HSA were cationized to various degrees by the addition of amino groups. When approximately 20 or more new amino groups were added to HSA and approximately 25 or more amino groups were added to anti-HSA, the proteins readily bound to cartilage and penetrated into the matrix. Soluble immune complexes made with the cationic antibodies, including small-latticed complexes, bound only to the surface of the cartilage. When cationic HSA was bound to the matrix of the cartilage, unaltered antibodies bound only to the antigen at the surface and did not penetrate the matrix. This model system defines the manner in which cationic antigens and antibodies bind to and penetrate into the articular cartilage.\r"
