A group of 86 children with antibody to Leishmania were identified. None of these children had a history of leishmaniasis. The children were segregated into four groups: One group remained asymptomatic (n = 20), whereas another developed classic kala-azar within weeks of the index serology (n = 15). The remaining 51 patients initially had subclinical disease; 13 (25%) of these patients progressed to classic kala-azar (mean, five months). The others (75%) resolved their illness after a prolonged period (mean, 35 months). The initial illness in the subclinical group was characterized by hepatomegaly, frequent splenomegaly, intermittent cough, diarrhea, and low-grade fever. Malaise and poor weight gain were common. Giemsa-stained smears and cultures of bone marrow aspirates were usually negative for Leishmania in the absence of symptoms of classic kala-azar.\r"

The detection of these antibodies was done by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a synthetic multivalent MDP conjugate as an antigen. Sera from 33 of 54 children with ARF had detectable levels of antibodies to MDP at the time of diagnosis. Such antibodies could only be detected in sera from two of 52 healthy children and one of 21 children with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The specificity of the antibodies to MDP was demonstrated by inhibition, with free MDP, of binding of the sera to the MDP conjugate. The possible use of these antibodies in the diagnosis of ARF and in screening for safe synthetic muramyl peptides in immunization of humans is discussed.\r"

The occurrence of soft hemolysis was analyzed statistically in 6,723 sera. The specificity of soft hemolysis for infection with rubella virus was 99.0%. Its sensitivity in primary infections was 97.3%, and the predictive value for rubella serodiagnosis (increase in IgG level or detectable IgM) was 91.2%. The temporal association of soft hemolysis with rubella was determined with sera obtained from 129 persons during late convalescence (70-310 days after onset of symptoms). Soft hemolysis disappeared by 190 days after the onset of symptoms and the presence of ordinary hemolysis ruled out primary rubella in the preceding 70-100 days. Soft hemolysis was caused by IgG antibody to rubella virus, and thus represents a new serodiagnostic principle. This technique, together with an Igm assay, allows rapid diagnosis of recent rubella from a single serum sample.\r"

  ".W": "Two systems for measuring embryo development in vitro were evaluated. One was a 1-4 scale based on a subjective evaluation of embryo quality (EQ) from microscopic appearance. In addition, a formula for scoring embryo growth rate in vitro was developed. The embryo development rating (EDR) was based on the ratio between the time at which embryos were observed at a particular stage after insemination and the time at which they would be expected to reach that stage in a hypothetical \"ideal\" growth rate with a cell cycle length of 11.9 hr. Using this scoring system, \"normally\" growing embryos scored 100. This approach was aimed at partially normalizing the data and allowed all embryos to be analyzed similarly regardless of the time of observation. Analysis of 1539 embryo replacements resulting in 232 clinical pregnancies showed that both EDR and embryo-quality scores were of value in predicting success, with clinical pregnancy most likely to eventuate from a combination of moderate to good EQ scores (2-4) coupled with average or above-average growth rates (EDR scores from 90 to 129). Poor-quality and very slowly or very rapidly growing embryos were underrepresented in cycles that proceeded to pregnancy. These inferences were based on all embryos transferred (mean, 2.73 per transfer cycle), and they were substantiated by an analysis of 33 pregnancies resulting from replacement of a single embryo and from 18 pregnancies in which all embryos scored the same with both systems. EQ and EDR were significantly associated with each other and together provide a valuable guide in predicting pregnancy, in selecting embryos for freezing, and in monitoring day-to-day performance in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.\r"

The AGN cases were both postpharyngeal and postpyodermal in origin. Despite the fact that ARF and AGN were occurring in the same neighborhoods and among families of equivalent size and socioeconomic status, the pharyngeal isolation rates of group A streptococci were significantly lower among patients with ARF and their household contacts than among patients with AGN and their contacts. Moreover, the streptococcal throat colonization rates and geometric mean anti-streptolysin O titers were similar in ARF families and the families of noninfected controls. Streptococci of M-type 5, a highly rheumatogenic type, were isolated from three patients with ARF (representing 36% of group A isolates from this group) and one ARF contact but never from patients with AGN, control subjects, or their respective contacts. These observations suggest possible differences in the streptococcal milieus from which ARF and AGN cases emerge. The nature of such differences requires further exploration.\r"

Cardiac output and regional blood flow were measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in rats with portal hypertension caused by portal vein stenosis, in rats with end-to-side portacaval shunts, and in sham-operated rats. Cardiac output was significantly higher in rats with surgical shunts than in those of the two other groups and was significantly lower in sham-operated rats compared with portal hypertensive rats. Portal tributary blood flow and hepatic arterial blood flow expressed in absolute flow as well as in percentage of cardiac output were significantly increased in rats with surgical shunts compared with other groups. These blood flows were also significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated animals. A significant correlation was found between cardiac output and portal tributary blood flow in rats with portal vein stenosis and in rats with surgical shunts; this correlation was absent in sham-operated rats. This study shows that the hyperkinetic circulatory state in rats with portal hypertension and a normal liver is related to the presence of portasystemic shunts but not to portal hypertension per se.\r"

Previously the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3) was found to be inappropriately low in SHR in view of their ionized hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. We examined the responses of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 to several known stimuli. Baseline plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels tended to be lower in SHR than WKY rats (51.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 82.3 +/- 14.1 pg/ml, P = 0.06). Infusion of a pharmacologic dose of parathyroid hormone (8 U/hr over a period of 17 hours) resulted in a plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 504 +/- 77 pg/ml in SHR vs. 1016 +/- 211 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.03). Cyclic adenosine monophosphate infusion (1 mumol/hr/100 gm over a period of 17 hours) in thyroparathyroidectomized animals resulted in a 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 121 +/- 24 pg/ml in SHR vs. 557 +/- 26 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.01). After dietary phosphorus depletion for 3 weeks, SHR also had lower 1,25(OH)2D3 levels than WKY rats (83 +/- 13 vs. 300 +/- 42 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) even though a comparable degree of hypophosphatemia was achieved. Thus, the response of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels to several known stimuli is submaximal in SHR as compared with WKY rats, suggesting defective synthesis or enhanced metabolic clearance of this hormone.\r"

  ".U": "87059494\r", 
  ".W": "We observed quinidine-induced prolongation of bleeding time without thrombocytopenia in three subjects. In addition, we noticed a cumulative prolongation of bleeding time by a combination of quinidine and aspirin. We postulated that because both quinidine and aspirin inhibit epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a cumulative effect of the two drugs might be responsible for the hemostatic defect. In studies using normal human platelets, we confirmed a marked reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation by the combination of these two agents. To further study the potential mechanism of this cumulative effect, platelet lysates were incubated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist tritiated yohimbine in the presence of quinidine and aspirin. On the basis of the radioligand binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was observed to increase in the presence of quinidine as well as aspirin. The combination of these two agents caused a marked increase in the KD of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors without alteration in the number of receptor sites. These data suggest that the cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor KD may relate to the significant reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. This phenomenon, coupled with other well-known effects of aspirin on the platelet release reaction and arachidonate metabolism, may lead to bleeding problems in some patients receiving this combination.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic inflammation in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with the accumulation of iron in mononuclear phagocytes. Cigarette smoking, which also produces chronic pulmonary inflammation, may be associated with iron accumulation in alveolar macrophages (AM). We have examined the total iron content in human AM and found it to be 43.0 +/- 7.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 12.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/1 X 10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) from smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Because the higher iron content in smokers' macrophages may reflect increased internalization, the binding and uptake of iron-saturated transferrin was examined in cells from smokers and nonsmokers. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups. The smoking-related alteration in iron content may instead reflect differences in the fate of internalized iron. Iron internalized by AM as iron 59 initially bound to transferrin was distributed to a cytoplasmic, largely ferritin-associated, pool more slowly in smokers than in nonsmokers, during a 24-hour incubation in vitro. Significantly less newly internalized iron was returned to the culture medium by AM from smokers, which by 24 hours had released 11.0% +/- 3.7% of the initially internalized 59Fe compared with 36.0% +/- 2.3% for nonsmokers (P less than 0.01). The increased accumulation of iron by AM in the alveolar space of smokers may modulate hydroxyl radical production in the microenvironment of these cells.\r"

The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC. Furthermore, it was suggested that TU infusion at a higher rate significantly interferes with the hepatic uptake (or storage) of BSP.\r"

The derived microvesicles from each line were as effective as the intact cells in inducing thrombogenesis on both undigested and alpha-chymotrypsin-digested subendothelium. Thrombus size on digested vessels was greater than on undigested vessels by fivefold for SKNMC cells and microvesicles and by 20-fold for U87MG cells and sevenfold for U87MG microvesicles. The results show that microvesicles from both cell lines initiate interactions between platelets and subendothelium identical to those caused by intact tumor cells. The results also demonstrate that intact tumor cells in the circulation may not be necessary for the thromboembolic complications of malignancy.\r"

  ".U": "87059501\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of the increased renal clearance of amylase and the amylase to creatinine clearance ratio (CAM/CCR) in acute pancreatitis remains controversial with both renal tubular dysfunction and altered glomerular permeability being invoked as explanations. To differentiate between these mechanisms, we investigated the quantity and character of protein excretion in 10 patients with pancreatitis. For a short period of time, seven of 10 patients had mild proteinuria with a mean protein excretion rate of 230 +/- 154 mg/24 hr. Proteinuria decreased in 9/9 survivors to 17 +/- 18 mg/24 hr. Albumin excretion rate initially was minimally increased in 10/10 patients with a mean of 61 +/- 40 mg/24 hr, decreasing during recovery in 8/9 survivors to 10.9 +/- 10.4 mg/24 hr (P less than 0.01). Electrophoresis of urine obtained during the acute phase consistently showed a low molecular weight proteinuria pattern that cleared with recovery. Twenty-one of 22 urinary samples with an elevated CAM/CCR had a low molecular weight protein pattern. All the above findings can be explained by alterations in renal tubular reabsorption of proteins without changes in glomerular permeability. In 2/4 patients a low molecular weight protein was present in urine specimens from the acute phase that was not present in highly concentrated urine specimens from the recovery period. This raises the possibility that an abnormal low molecular weight protein enters the serum in acute pancreatitis, which, after glomerular filtration, produces the renal tubular malfunction found in acute pancreatitis.\r"

Three patient populations were identified for comparison: patients admitted by private family physicians when residents were not involved in patient care, patients admitted by the same family physicians while they served as attending physicians on the family practice service and allowed residents to participate in the care of their patients, and patients admitted by residents from the patient population at the Family Practice Center. After taking into account differences in case mix, an analysis of laboratory charges, radiology use, frequency of procedures, and use of consultants showed that the three groups were not different. Family practice residents managed their own patients as cost effectively as physicians in private practice, which suggests that experience alone is not necessary to develop methods of cost-efficient care. When these two groups were combined into a teaching unit, with few exceptions this efficiency was maintained. These results imply that the introduction of family practice residents into patient care does not invariably increase expenses to the patient.\r"

The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration in vitreous fluid was more than 20 times higher in the cold exposed animals than in controls (44.2 +/- 9.2 versus 2.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL). Autolysis alone caused an increase to 33.5 +/- 7.7 ng/mL, and freezing alone to 13.4 +/- 5.3 ng/mL. The highest values were in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. Adrenaline (A) concentration in the vitreous fluid increased fourfold (3.9 +/- 1.5 versus 0.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL) in cold exposure and twofold as a result of autolysis. Dopamine (DA) concentration in vitreous fluid was elevated only in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. The increase of NA concentration in urine was fivefold during the whole exposure (from 19.4 +/- 6.9 to 109 +/- 57.3 ng/mL), but A was increased by twentyfold (from 10 +/- 5.1 to 213.2 +/- 168.7 ng/mL), whereas DA concentration did not change. The increase of average excretion of NA to urine was eightfold during the first 6 h of exposure, and that of A tenfold. According to the present results, elevated concentrations of catecholamines in the vitreous fluid and urine can be used as a diagnostic aid for hypothermia death. Concerning the values of noradrenaline in the vitreous, the increase as a result of autolysis must be taken in account when interpreting the results.\r"

In addition, the influence of age on morphometric dimensions and the soft tissue cover was tested. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that nasal height and nasal length are best predicted by the dimensions of the skull, whereas nasal depth and the thickness of the soft tissues is greatly influenced by age. In males, over 50% of the variance of nasal height and nasal length were accounted for by the height of the bony nose and the prominence of the ossa nasalia, and in females it was about 40%. Although the thickness of the soft tissue is dependent on exogenous factors, such as nutrition, mimicry, and so forth, the dimensions of the bony nose apparently also influence the skin depths to some extent. High and prominent noses were found to have a thinner layer of soft tissue over the nasal bones than short and less prominent ones. It thus seems as if there is a tendency of the soft tissue cover to adjust to disharmonies of the bony profile.\r"

Although safely used for years for infantile colic, recently, the administration of dicyclomine has been related to acute episodes of apnea, seizures, and coma. In the absence of those acute reactions, we feel that a 200-ng/mL blood dicyclomine level in a child dying of apparent SIDS should not prevent categorization of the death as SIDS.\r"

This study followed the treatment progress of 20 patients for a mean of 39 months after intake. The study included a detailed history, neurological examination, and psychological testing on each patient. At follow-up each patient was interviewed and a questionnaire was completed by his or her therapist to assess treatment response. Although nine patients achieved partial or full integration, complete integration was maintained by only five. During therapy the unintegrated patients experienced emotional trauma at approximately twice the rate as did the patients who eventually became integrated. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and hypnosis were the most widely prescribed therapies. The improvement in multiple personality appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion from acceptance of the diagnosis to integration. The progress of therapy was hindered most commonly by the overuse of the mental mechanisms of repression and denial, the continued utilization of secrecy, which began during child abuse, and the production of numerous crises. The most common countertransferences included anger, exasperation, and emotional exhaustion. Although the psychotherapy of patients with multiple personality is tedious and time consuming, it can be eminently successful if the patient and therapist persevere.\r"

  ".W": "Dissociation is a lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation occurs to some degree in normal individuals and is thought to be more prevalent in persons with major mental illnesses. The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has been developed to offer a means of reliably measuring dissociation in normal and clinical populations. Scale items were developed using clinical data and interviews, scales involving memory loss, and consultations with experts in dissociation. Pilot testing was performed to refine the wording and format of the scale. The scale is a 28-item self-report questionnaire. Subjects were asked to make slashes on 100-mm lines to indicate where they fall on a continuum for each question. In addition, demographic information (age, sex, occupation, and level of education) was collected so that the connection between these variables and scale scores could be examined. The mean of all item scores ranges from 0 to 100 and is called the DES score. The scale was administered to between 10 and 39 subjects in each of the following populations: normal adults, late adolescent college students, and persons suffering from alcoholism, agoraphobia, phobic-anxious disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and multiple personality disorder. Reliability testing of the scale showed that the scale had good test-retest and good split-half reliability. Item-scale score correlations were all significant, indicating good internal consistency and construct validity. A Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc comparisons of the scores of the eight populations provided evidence of the scale's criterion-referenced validity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes.\r"

Eighteen additional diagnoses (a 6.7% increase) were appreciated when these excluded symptoms were considered as psychiatrically significant; however, only two of these new diagnoses were given to patients previously without a psychiatric diagnosis. The authors concluded that the DIS is sensitive in its detection of psychiatric illness in diabetes and perhaps other physical illnesses as well.\r"

Although methods of ascertainment are not standardised, regional differences and changes with time are present for each of these statistics. Mortality has declined, whereas prevalence and hospital discharge rates have increased owing in part to the improved survival but also to better case ascertainment. The gradient in prevalence seen between Southern England (63/10(5)), Northern England and Northern Ireland (76-79/10(5)), Wales (c. 113/10(5)), North-East Scotland (155/10(5)) and the Orkneys (258/10(5)) can in part be attributed to varying methods of ascertainment but correlates with regional differences in the frequency of HLA-DR2 in normal individuals (21-50%). However no HLA-DR2 association is observed in parts of Scotland, where the prevalence is the highest in the United Kingdom, because HLA-DR2 and linked genes occur in up to 50% of the normal population from these areas. If the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is multifactorial the frequency of the disease will increase where susceptibility genes are common because the probability of concurrence of the remaining critical events is high; conversely when each aetiological agent is infrequent the chance of them all occurring in the same individual and therefore incidence of the disease are both lower. The fall in incidence observed in the Orkney Islands, possibly reflecting decline in an exogenous agent interacting with susceptibility factors, is consistent with this multifactorial hypothesis.\r"

Of those patients who developed multiple sclerosis, 92% had symptoms within 4 years of the first attack of optic neuritis.

This type of infestation usually is long-standing, almost never requires surgical treatment, responds to praziquantel therapy and has a good prognosis. In contrast, patients who present with hydrocephalus, large supratentorial cysts, multiple granulomata with cerebral oedema or with vasculitis and cerebral infarction, have an aggressive, acute or subacute illness, presenting with raised intracranial pressure, gait disturbances, mental changes, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hemisphere syndromes, chronic meningitis and stroke.

  ".W": "In six depressed epileptic patients stabilised on carbamazepine therapy, addition of the antidepressant agent viloxazine (300 mg/day for three weeks) induced a marked (average 55%) increase in steady-state plasma carbamazepine concentration. The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide also increased during viloxazine therapy, but to a lesser extent (16%). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of viloxazine. In a seventh patient, viloxazine had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide levels (by 197% and 137% respectively). Although viloxazine appears to be one of the few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine. The mechanism of the interaction probably involves inhibition of the metabolism of both carbamazepine and its active epoxide metabolite.\r"

The subjects were requested to draw on a graphic tablet triangles and squares of different size and shape. The patients produced a larger number of EMG burst compared with controls. The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories.\r"

The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic mechanism involved in the generation of VEP delays is sensitive to stimulus spatial frequency. The study of VEPs before and after the administration of haloperidol confirmed this hypothesis. VEP latency did not correlate with the major clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could not predict the results of chronic dopaminergic therapy.\r"

In Parkinsonian versus normal patients (previously reported) it was observed that: the neutral angle in Parkinson's disease patients was significantly smaller (92 degrees +/- 15 degrees) than in normals (107 degrees +/- 10 degrees), and in Parkinson's disease patients, even with relatively mild symptoms, the upper limb was stiffer than normals in the totally relaxed state with no electromyographic activity present. Our results suggest that changes in the passive mechanical properties of the upper limb affected by Parkinsonian rigidity may have taken place, accounting for the more flexed neutral elbow angle and greater passive stiffness. Using this technique, response to antirigidity therapy and natural progression of illness can be quantitatively assessed and followed.\r"

Therefore methyl tetrahydrofolate treatment of the neurological and psychiatric manifestations of folate deficiency would seem to be theoretically advantageous. A case of subacute combined degeneration of the cord due to dietary folate deficiency and associated with an organic brain syndrome is reported. There was striking haematological, neurological and psychiatric response to methyl folate treatment.\r"

The dilution ratio was determined during each calibration by diluting air with oxygen and noting the reduction in the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen. Empiric correction was made by the computer for the effects of density and viscosity, relative to air, on the flow of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the saturated vapors of the three anesthetics through the capillary resistor. The computer was programmed to control solenoid valves both for calibration and for the multiplexed sampling of operating rooms. Oxygen, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were used as pure gases, and halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were vaporized at room temperature in 50-ml vaporizers. The resulting calibrations were found to be accurate to within +/- 2%.\r"

The clinical usefulness of pulse oximetry in the early recognition of decreased pulmonary blood flow or partial airway obstruction was demonstrated. Early diagnosis of changes in oxygenation was especially helpful in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, in whom small changes in arterial oxygen tension may cause large changes in oxygen saturation.\r"

  ".W": "Both halothane and nitrous oxide can be reduced at the cathode of a polarographic oxygen electrode, causing the electrode current to drift upward and report falsely high oxygen tension. Because transcutaneous oxygen tension is measured by a heated oxygen electrode, there is a potential for significant upward drift of these values. To examine the clinical significance of this drift, the following study was performed. Transcutaneous oxygen tension sensors were calibrated at oxygen tensions of 0 mm Hg and 157 mm Hg (room air) just before clinical use during anesthesia. This calibration was rechecked immediately upon removal of the sensor from the patient at the end of the anesthesia. The predominant anesthetic agent used and the duration of monitoring were noted from the record. Data were collected from 208 patients representing a total of 463.6 hours of anesthesia. The patients were divided into five groups based on anesthetic administered: halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, nitrous oxide-narcotic, and local/regional. The mean zero point recalibration value was 0.4 mm Hg or less for all agents except halothane, for which it was 1.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. This halothane drift was significantly greater than that for the other agents (P less than 0.01). Room air recalibration was not significantly different in any of the five groups, varying from 160 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for halothane to 157 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for enflurane. All these drift values are within the manufacturer's specifications. We conclude that the drift of the transcutaneous oxygen tension sensor due to anesthetic agents is not clinically significant. However, caution should be exercised when halothane is used during an extremely long period of anesthesia.\r"

In development of the system, emphasis was placed on providing an anesthesiologist-computer interface that can be adapted to typical situations during anesthesia and to individual user behavior. One main feature of this interface is the integration of the input and output of information. The only device for interaction between the anesthesiologist and the AIS is a touch-sensitive, high-resolution color display screen. The anesthesiologist enters information by touching virtual function keys displayed on the screen. A data window displays all data generated over time, such as automatically recorded vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal and esophageal temperatures, and manually entered variables, such as administered drugs, and ventilator settings. The information gathered by the AIS is presented on the cathode ray tube in several pages. A main distributor page gives an overall view of the content of every work page. A one-page record of the anesthesia is automatically plotted on a multicolor digital plotter during the operation. An example of the use of the AIS is presented from a field test of the system during which it was evaluated in the operating room without interfering with the ongoing operation. Medical staff who used the AIS imitated the anesthesiologist's recording and information search behavior but did not have responsibility for the conduct of the anesthetic.\r"

Monitoring is deemed necessary to avoid problems, although there is little hard evidence that a specific monitor will improve outcome. The risk associated with modern noninvasive monitors, however, is negligible, and they should be considered for routine use in all patients. Although errors in the variables displayed or misuse of correct information can cause difficulties, these result from a lack of education and are not a valid reason to abandon a particular monitoring modality. Regular use of such monitoring tools as the electroencephalogram would allow clinicians to become familiar with how to interpret it in normal and crisis situations. The cost of a disaster during anesthesia (such as unrecognized hypoxia) is high. The dollars spent to cover a single major malpractice award could buy a tremendous number of monitors. The state of the art in the mid-1980s demands traditional anesthesia monitors plus continuous capnography and measurement of peripheral oxygenation. Other negligible-risk monitors should also be used when feasible. Improvement in monitoring design, particularly in output formats and in integration of monitored data, will be essential in the next few years, as will training in the proper use of monitors.\r"

The median time from initial therapy to development of secondary leukemia or MDS was 71 months (range, 7 to 331 months). The initial malignancy was hematologic in 43%. An MDS presentation occurred in 57 patients (51%), 55% of whom subsequently transformed to acute leukemia. Chromosomal abnormalities were documented in marrow specimens from 70 of 89 patients with analyzable metaphases (79%; 69% of the total group). Compared with 34 patients with metachronous secondary leukemia without prior chemotherapy or irradiation, those with therapy-related leukemia exhibited a significantly higher frequency of abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 (43% v 18%), and lower incidence of diploid karyotypes (18% v 50%). Chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were also significantly higher in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, procarbazine, and nitrosoureas (72% to 83%), compared with those who had received cyclophosphamide-based regimens (29%), other chemotherapies (14%), or irradiation alone (29%). The median overall survival from diagnosis of the secondary leukemia or MDS was 30 weeks. Survival was significantly shorter for patients with acute leukemia compared with MDS presentation (21 v 45 weeks); in the latter category, it was similar whether evolution to acute leukemia occurred or not. Of 72 patients treated with antileukemia therapy, 29% achieved complete remission (CR). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated the cytogenetic pattern to be the most important characteristic determining remission rate and survival. Other important prognostic features were the morphologic presentation (MDS v acute leukemia) for probability of achieving remission, and patient age and marrow blasts percentage for survival.\r"

From 1976 to 1980, 91 patients (group A) were treated with induction chemotherapy: Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio), vincristine, and methotrexate (AVM) and RT on a cyclical schedule; and maintenance chemotherapy: vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (VCF). From 1980 to 1982, 79 patients (group B) received induction chemotherapy, Adriamycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (AVCMF) and RT on a cyclical schedule and VCF maintenance. Hormonal manipulation was performed in all groups. Disease-free survival at 4 years was 15% for group C, 32% for group A, and 54% for group B (P less than .005 group C v group A, less than .00001 group C v group B, and less than .01 group A v group B).

Clinical assessment of tumor aggressiveness, nodal status, type of chemotherapy administered, and early response to chemotherapy (by third course) were all prognostic factors.

  ".W": "Between 1978 and 1981, 463 evaluable postmenopausal patients 65 years of age or younger with operable breast cancer and metastases in axillary lymph nodes were entered in Ludwig Breast Cancer Study III (Ludwig III) and randomly allocated to receive chemoendocrine therapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, low-dose continuous prednisone, and tamoxifen (CMFp + T) for 12 monthly cycles, or endocrine therapy alone with prednisone and tamoxifen (p + T) for 1 year, or no adjuvant treatment after mastectomy (observation). At 60 months' median follow-up, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 59% for CMFp + T, 41% for p + T, and 31% for observation (P less than .0001), and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 71% for CMFp + T, 64% for p + T, and 59% for observation (P = .16; CMFp + T v observation, P = .07). A new quality of life-oriented endpoint was defined to assist in the selection of therapeutic approach after surgery for postmenopausal patients: the time without symptoms of disease and subjective toxic effects of treatment (TWiST). Despite the larger initial discount due to subjective toxicity with chemoendocrine therapy, by 5 years postmastectomy the net difference in average TWiST for treated patients compared with the observation group was positive and approximately equal for both adjuvant treatment programs. Adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for postmenopausal women appears to be justified due to an emerging OS advantage and increasing TWiST gained for the treated patients.\r"

Two hundred forty-one patients were evaluable for survival and 207 for response. We obtained a 25% objective response rate in the standard-dose arm and 29% in the high-dose arm; this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant improvement in the overall survival or survival of responders with the high-dose regimen. However, toxicity (mainly myelosuppression) was significantly increased in the patients receiving the higher dose of cisplatin. An analysis of prognostic factors showed that disease progression, loss of body weight, performance status, and prior therapy were predictive parameters of survival.\r"

  ".W": "Although increased efficacy has been described with a five-day schedule of high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) in hypertonic saline, severe myelosuppression and cumulative neurotoxicity have limited the usefulness of this therapy. In order to evaluate a possible dose-response relationship in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 17 patients with metastatic disease were treated with a modified dose schedule delivering the same total dose (200 mg/m2) in a divided day 1 and 8 schedule. During a pilot study, a total of 47 cycles of therapy were administered, with a median of three cycles per patient and a median total cumulative dose of 600 mg/m2. Nine of 17 patients received at least 600 mg/m2. While nephrotoxicity was similar to previous reports of the five-day schedule, the incidence and severity of myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy were markedly reduced. Using this modified schedule, severe myelosuppression did not occur. Clinically severe peripheral neuropathy developed in only one patient (6%). The overall response rate was 47% (eight of 17 patients). Plasma platinum pharmacokinetics during five cycles of the modified day 1 and 8 schedule were compared with pharmacokinetics of the five-day schedule. Accumulation of plasma ultrafiltrate platinum occurred in the five-day schedule, but not in the day 1 and 8 schedule. This difference in pharmacokinetics is one possible explanation for the reduced toxicity of this modified schedule. Although the degree of activity seen in this pilot study is encouraging, the efficacy of high-dose CDDP in NSCLC remains to be defined. In view of reduced myelosuppression and neurotoxicity, further trials with this modified schedule are indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two patients with intransit metastases of melanoma in a limb were treated by isolated regional perfusion chemotherapy using mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard). Group 1 (n = 12) underwent treatment at low dose, less than 0.35 mg/kg, or low temperature, less than 38 degrees C. Group 2 (n = 30) received higher doses, 0.35 to 0.6 mg/kg, plus heat at 38 degrees C to 41 degrees C. No patient had evidence of disease outside the limb at the time of perfusion. The median follow-up time was 48 months (range, 1 to 9 years). Of the 42 patients, 29 had measurable lesions that responded as follows: group 1, complete response (CR) in two of ten and partial response (PR) in none; group 2, CR in six of 19 and PR in six of 19. The combined CR and PR rate of 12 of 19 in group 2 was significantly higher than that of group 1 (P less than .05). CR lasted only 2 months in the two patients of group 1, but persisted in the six patients of Group 2, four of whom are still alive free of disease at 16, 21, 33, and 40 months. Relapse-free control of disease in the limb was achieved in 36% of the patients in group 2 at 24 months, compared with 0% in group 1 (P less than .05). An overall survival of 74% at 48 months was observed in group 2, significantly higher than that of 64% for group 1 (P less than .05). The status of the regional lymph nodes (RLN) and the number of metastases did not affect tumor response. However, 77% of RLN-negative patients survived 48 months, in contrast to only 38% of RLN-positive patients (P less than .05). One patient died postoperatively of myocardial infarction. No serious systemic toxicity developed. Two patients who underwent repeat salvage perfusions developed a reversible peripheral neuropathy in the limb. Limb function was good after treatment, and dramatically improved in patients who had advanced satellitosis that responded to treatment. These results suggest that heated limb perfusion using mechlorethamine at an adequate dose can offer long-term control of intransit metastases in approximately one third of these patients, with preservation of good limb function and possible prolongation of survival.\r"

  ".W": "Several preclinical and clinical studies have documented that dose or dose intensity of chemotherapeutic agents are important factors for response of patients' tumors. This finding has prompted empiric trials of certain chemotherapeutic agents in high-dose or regional administration treatment regimens. The present study was performed to identify agents that would be particularly good candidates for high-dose or regional administration regimens against particular types of tumors. Using a human tumor cloning technique, we constructed dose in vitro response lines for ten different chemotherapeutic agents against seven different histologic types of malignancies. Slopes of the lines indicated the agents with the greatest increases of in vitro response per increment in dose of the agent. Tumors against which the agents gave the steepest dose response lines included lymphoma, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, and small-cell lung cancer, while the dose response lines for non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer were quite flat. Suggestions for clinical trials based on these findings include the use of high-dose melphalan for patients with lymphoma, head and neck, and ovarian cancer; the use of mitoxantrone in high-dose regimens for patients with breast cancer; high-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with small-cell lung cancer; high-dose bleomycin regimens for patients with non-small-cell lung and head and neck cancer; and regional perfusion of liver metastases from colorectal cancer with cisplatin. Prospective testing of high-dose or regional administration regimens suggested by this new model should indicate its use for prediction of the best agent to use in high-dose regimens against a particular tumor type.\r"

  ".W": "Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA, NSC 95580) has been demonstrated to be the most effective of the known and studied polar-planar compounds at inducing differentiation in a wide variety of leukemic and nonleukemic cell lines. Although HMBA demonstrated no antineoplastic activity in preclinical testing, it was selected for clinical development on the basis of its potent differentiating capabilities in vitro. In this phase I study, HMBA was administered as a continuous five-day infusion every 3 weeks to patients with advanced cancer. Twenty-three patients received 35 evaluable courses at doses that ranged from 4.8 to 33.6 g/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities included renal insufficiency, a hyperchloremic metabolic acidemia/acidosis, and CNS toxicities manifested by agitation and delirium, which progressed to coma in one patient who developed concomitant renal insufficiency. Moderate myelosuppression, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting were also observed. The pharmacokinetics of HMBA best fit a single compartmental model and disposition is primarily by renal elimination. Renal excretion of HMBA and of the primary metabolite, 6-acetoamidohexanoic acid, together account for the disposition of 66% to 93% (mean, 74%) of the infused drug. Based on this trial, the maximum tolerated and recommended phase II doses for HMBA administered on this schedule are 33.6 and 24 g/m2/d, respectively. However, since steady-state HMBA levels at these doses were in the range of 1 to 2 mmol/L, only approaching the lower limit demonstrated for in vitro differentiating effectiveness, and because of evidence suggesting that the exposure period is an important variable in the induction of differentiation, additional studies examining longer periods of infusion are warranted.\r"

Of these, 32 patients underwent surgery, while 11 patients underwent radiation alone. Before operation, 25 patients had relapsed following prior radiation, while seven others received postoperative radiation. A more aggressive surgical approach, tailored to the site of compression within the spinal canal, was used with the majority undergoing gross total tumor resection by an anterior approach. Immediate stability of the spine was achieved with methyl-methacrylate reconstruction of the resected segments. Preoperative spinal angiography with embolization of hypervascular tumors was carried out in eight patients. Patient parameters in the surgical and irradiated groups were comparable, except that a greater proportion of the radiation alone group had more than one organ system involved (64% v 44%). The median survival of the surgically treated patients was 13 months, compared with 3 months for those treated by radiation alone. In addition, a greater proportion of the surgically treated patients were benefitted neurologically (70%) compared with those treated by radiation (45%). With the development of effective surgical treatment for spinal metastases, early consideration for surgical treatment (before radiation) should be considered in selected patients. Preoperative spinal angiography and embolization are recommended whenever feasible to minimize intraoperative blood loss.\r"

A similar LPC has been reported in cats and monkeys. In this study, the LPC of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in the cat was used to detect impairment in attention to a relevant stimulus after low levels of cerebral concussion produced by a fluid percussion device. A hollow screw (for fluid percussion) and stainless steel screws (for AEP recording) were surgically placed in the skull. After recovery from surgery, animals were trained in the paradigm to obtain an LPC. Pupillary dilation was conditioned to tones. A random sequence of two discriminable tones was presented. The lower tone had a probability of 0.1 and was followed by a tail shock (tone-shock). After 400 to 1000 tone-shock presentations, animals attended to the lower tone stimulus as inferred by selective pupillary dilation. In the AEP an early positive component at 50 to 120 msec related to an alerting response was enhanced, and an LPC at 250 to 450 msec appeared in response to the paired tone-shock. Animals were then subjected to cerebral concussion. Complete recovery of normal reflexes, motor coordination, and orienting response was seen within 2 hours after injury. The LPC was suppressed for a period of at least 3 days, suggesting that low magnitudes of brain injury can disrupt higher-order neural activities. This disruption can persist despite recovery of other neurological functions.\r"

  ".W": "Tethered spinal cord, or tethered cord syndrome, describes a disorder manifested by progressive motor and sensory deficit in the legs and by incontinence. Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the elongated spinal cord is anchored by a thick filum terminale or other pathological structures. The underlying mechanism is impairment of oxidative metabolism in the lumbosacral cord. The authors studied the extensibility of various parts of lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments in experimental animals and correlated this with the oxidative metabolism in these segments. The filum terminale possesses far greater extensibility than any spinal cord segments and functions as a buffer in preventing the cord from overstretching. The lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments elongate under traction only below the attachment of the lowest pair of dentate ligaments. The lower the cord segment, the greater the percentage of elongation in spite of limited elasticity of the cord tissue; this greater percentage of elongation of the spinal cord correlates with increasing impairment of the oxidative metabolism and more severe neurological deficit. These findings explain such symptoms and signs as motor and sensory deficits in the legs associated with the human tethered cord syndrome, and correspond with the high clinical incidence of incontinence. The lower spinal cord segments elongated promptly within 3 seconds after the start of traction. This implies that repeated acute hyperextension and hyperflexion, as occurs in humans, may accentuate oxidative metabolic changes that have already been caused by chronic cord tethering. The authors conclude that the elongation of the spinal cord under traction parallels the degree of metabolic dysfunction.\r"

One day after the procedure, the patient developed pontine and cerebellar ischemia which completely resolved after 5 days on heparin therapy. A follow-up angiogram performed immediately after the procedure and at 3 months demonstrated complete occlusion of the mid-basilar artery and the aneurysm. The patient was intact neurologically upon discharge 5 days after the embolization procedure and has since resumed his normal activities.

  ".W": "A new technique for percutaneous lumbar disc removal is described. The specially designed 2-mm blunt-tipped suction/cutting probe (nucleotome) is similar to the automated vitrectomy instrumentation used by ophthalmic surgeons. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient in the prone position and with fluoroscopic guidance. The nucleotome is inserted into the appropriate disc space with specially designed instrumentation, guided by landmarks similar to those used in needle placement for chemonucleolysis. The technique has been evaluated in 20 patients with herniated discs (one at the L3-4 level and 19 at the L4-5 level) confirmed by myelography and/or computerized tomography scans after all conservative therapy for primarily radicular pain had failed. From 1 to 7 gm of disc material was removed in an average total operative time of approximately 1 hour. Eighty percent of the patients had good to excellent results in a short-term follow-up period of 6 months. Four patients subsequently required standard surgical excision of free disc fragments. No significant complications occurred. The procedure is contraindicated in patients with extruded or free fragments of disc in the spinal canal or in patients with herniations at the L5-S1 level pending development of additional instrumentation for insertion at that level. More extensive long-term studies are needed to further evaluate this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report the results of a long-term follow-up study of 130 patients with 161 unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. Their findings suggest that unruptured saccular aneurysms less than 10 mm in diameter have a very low probability of subsequent rupture. The mean diameter of the aneurysms that subsequently ruptured was 21.3 mm, compared with a diameter of 7.5 mm for aneurysms defined after rupture at the same institution. Part of the explanation for this discrepancy may be that the size of the filling compartment of the aneurysm decreases after rupture. There is also evidence from the present study that intracranial saccular aneurysms develop with increasing age of the patient and stabilize over a relatively short period, if they do not initially rupture, and that the likelihood of subsequent rupture decreases considerably if the initial stabilized size is less than 10 mm in diameter. Consequently, the critical size for aneurysm rupture is likely to be smaller if rupture occurs at the time of or soon after aneurysm formation. There seems to be a substantial difference in potential for growth and rupture between previously ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.\r"

Clinical follow-up evaluation for 8 years (range 4 to 13 years) and angiographic follow-up studies for 6 years (range 2 to 10 years) in these 27 cases revealed that one aneurysm rest increased in size and bled twice, five were spontaneously obliterated, two decreased in size, 13 remained unchanged, and in seven cases no late follow-up angiography was performed. The incidence of rebleeding from an aneurysm rest was 3.7% of the 27 in whom the sac was not obliterated and 0.14% of all 715 patients who were operated on.\r"

Twenty-two had a small and 12 had a large aneurysm located on the internal carotid artery (17 cases), anterior communicating artery (10 cases), middle cerebral artery (five cases), and pericallosal artery (two cases). Fifty-two percent of patients with a minor leak from an internal carotid artery aneurysm had ipsilateral, hemicranial, hemifacial, or periorbital pain. Half of the patients initially saw a physician, but in no case was the correct diagnosis made. Twenty-five patients had a major rupture within 24 hours to 4 weeks after findings suggesting a minor leak, with a mortality rate of 53%. Nine other patients were diagnosed by lumbar puncture or computerized tomography (CT) scanning after initial misdiagnosis and were operated on, without mortality, before a major rupture could occur. The CT scans were negative in 55% of patients with a minor leak, but lumbar puncture, when performed, was always positive. A minor leak prior to major aneurysmal rupture is a common occurrence and, if unrecognized, is associated with a high mortality. Computerized tomography scanning is unreliable in diagnosing this event, and lumbar puncture is the examination of choice once intracranial hypertension has been ruled out.\r"

  ".W": "Of 68 patients with unclippable aneurysms treated by proximal artery occlusion with detachable balloons, permanent occlusion was achieved in 65; of these patients, 37 had carotid artery aneurysms below the origin of the ophthalmic artery, 21 had aneurysms arising from the supraclinoid portion of the carotid artery, six had basilar trunk aneurysms, and one had a distal vertebral aneurysm. Examination for treatment selection included assessment of the circle of Willis by compression angiography and xenon blood flow studies, with the ultimate evaluation being test occlusion under systemic heparinization with the balloon temporarily placed in the desired position. Of 67 patients who underwent a formal occlusion test, eight with carotid artery aneurysms did not initially tolerate the occlusion test, and ischemic signs disappeared instantaneously with deflation and removal of the balloon. During test occlusion, two additional patients had ischemic events that proved to be embolic; these reversed immediately upon balloon deflation. Of the 65 patients in whom permanent occlusion was effected by detachable balloon, there were nine instances of delayed cerebral events. One of these was a seizure leading to respiratory arrest and resuscitation 3 days following occlusion in a patient who had presented with seizures. The other eight cases were delayed ischemic events; seven were completely reversed and one patient had residual weakness in one leg (1.5% permanent morbidity). Extracranial-intracranial bypass procedures were performed in 25 of the 65 cases. All aneurysms of the carotid artery below the level of the ophthalmic artery presented angiographic proof of complete thrombosis. Ten of 21 aneurysms arising from the supraclinoid portion of the carotid artery were completely thrombosed by proximal occlusion alone, without additional trapping procedures. Similarly, in three of six basilar trunk aneurysms, proximal occlusion alone initiated complete aneurysm thrombosis without trapping. The conclusion is that proximal balloon occlusion for unclippable cerebral aneurysms is a convenient, safe, and effective way of producing arterial occlusion in these cases.\r"

A large area of brain was shared between the neurologically normal infants, with defects in the scalp, skull, and dura. The twins were separated in a three-step procedure. First, areas of shared brain were divided and separated with silicone sheets. The second procedure consisted of the insertion of scalp expanders to allow primary skin closure. In the third procedure complete separation was performed which was complicated by severe hypotension in one infant that was due to dural sinus hemorrhage. Cerebrospinal fluid leak was the most difficult problem encountered in the postoperative period; this was treated with lumboperitoneal and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. After 2 years, one twin is neurologically normal; the other is severely developmentally delayed, possibly related to the severe hypotension experienced during the third procedure. A review of the literature on craniopagus is presented. Analysis of data in the literature suggests that the area involved in the craniopagus as well as the venous connections are closely related to survival following separation of craniopagus twins.\r"

Significant sexual differences were found in both regional uptake ratios and washout rates. These differences primarily reflected a proportionately decreased anterior and upper septal uptake in females, and faster washout in females. Faster myocardial 201Tl washout rates in females could not be clearly ascribed to either a physiological or artifactual explanation. It is concluded that since important differences exist between males and females in the detected pattern of 201Tl myocardial uptake and washout, sex-specific criteria may enhance the predictive accuracy of exercise-redistribution 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy.\r"

Three hundred twelve leukocyte scans on 271 patients were retrospectively reviewed and classified as positive or negative, and as to whether or not they were being treated with antibiotics at the time the leukocyte scan was performed. The overall sensitivity, considering all 312 studies, was 90%. One hundred sixty-nine patient studies were on patients receiving antibiotics; 143 studies were on patients not on antibiotics. The sensitivity of the leukocyte scan was 88.7% in patients on antibiotic therapy; it was 92.1% in those who were not receiving antibiotics. The differences in sensitivity between the two groups were not significantly different (p less than 0.05).

A vial, previously coated with 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3a, 6a-diphenyl glycouril (iodogen), is used as a reaction vessel. Iodination and separation of bound and free iodide, using AG1-X8 ion exchange resin, are both accomplished in this vial. We found 90 +/- 4% of the iodide which was added was incorporated, respectively, into each of four different monoclonal antibodies evaluated. Approximately 90% of labeled antibody was recovered in each case. The monoclonal antibody OC125 was labeled to specific activities up to 25 mCi/mg. Immunoreactivities of 82 +/- 2% using 125I and 66 +/- 5% using 131I were achieved. As the radioiodination is done in one sealed vial and takes less than 15 min, this procedure is safe and can be performed in any nuclear medicine laboratory. The final product, which is sterile and apyrogenic, is suitable for diagnostic and radiotherapeutic applications.\r"

  ".W": "In this investigation, determinations of peak diastolic filling rate (PDFR) and ejection fraction (EF) by two distinct nuclear techniques--gated radionuclide angiography (RNA) and nuclear cardiac probe (NCP)--were compared with contrast ventriculography in 44 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition, PDFR was tested as a potential index of the severity of disease. Good agreement in PDFR was found between NCP and contrast ventriculography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001), but there was poor correlation between RNA and contrast ventriculography. Ejection fraction measured by either RNA or NCP correlated well with contrast ventriculography (r = 0.96 and r = 0.73, respectively). A positive correlation was found between PDFR and the EF measured by the NCP (r = 0.79) and by contrast ventriculography (r = 0.64), but poor correlation was found between these parameters by RNA. Patients with multivessel CAD had lower PDFR than patients with single vessel disease when studied by the NCP (1.6 +/- 0.4 versus 2.5 versus 0.6 EDV/sec [mean +/- s.d.], p less than 0.0001), but not by RNA. Thus, compared with contrast ventriculography, determination of PDFR is more accurate by NCP than by RNA. Furthermore, the PDFR measured by NCP, but not by RNA, may be a potentially useful index of the extent of CAD.\r"

At baseline, antithrombin III activity and factor VII levels were reduced in all three patients; antithrombin III protein and protein C antigen were also slightly lowered in one patient, and factor X in another. beta-Thromboglobulin, a measure of platelet activation, was increased in one case. During pyridoxine treatment, antithrombin III activity was rapidly restored to normal; factor VII increased and beta-thromboglobulin decreased. These data suggest that, in addition to platelet activation, abnormalities of blood clotting, and particularly reduction of antithrombin III, may play a role in the thrombotic tendency associated with homocystinuria. The nature of these clotting alterations is still uncertain, but their improvement during active metabolic treatment suggests that the defect in amino acid transsulfuration of homocystinuria may directly affect synthesis or activity of some liver-dependent clotting factors.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated lung function in 20 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during the first year of life. Compared with a group of age- and size-matched controls, the infants with BPD had a significantly (P less than 0.005) lower functional residual capacity (FRC; 25 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 6 ml/kg) at less than 10 1/2 months after conception, but no significant difference during the remainder of the first year. The partial expiratory flow volume curves in the infants with BPD were markedly concave, with tidal breathing approaching expiratory flow limitation. The infants with BPD had significantly (P less than 0.01) lower absolute and size-corrected flows than did control infants, and 50% of the infants with BPD required rehospitalization because of acute respiratory distress associated with a lower respiratory tract illness. In addition, the slope of the linear regression of maximal expiratory flow at FRC (in milliliters per second) vs length (in centimeters) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) for the infants with BPD than for normal control infants (2.25 vs 4.52), indicating poor growth of the airways. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 was negatively correlated with maximal expiratory flow at FRC, indicating that measurement of SaO2 alone may not be sufficient in the evaluation of lung function in infants with BPD. We conclude that, although infants with BPD improve clinically during the first year of life, they have abnormal functional airway growth; the decreased expiratory flow reserve helps to explain their high risk for acute respiratory distress during lower respiratory tract illness.\r"

In five of eight term neonates and in all premature infants, a potentially significant limitation of neutrophil production was detected. Unlike the slowly proliferating CFU-GM present in the blood of healthy adult subjects (7% thymidine suicide, range 0% to 32%), the circulating CFU-GM in the premature subjects were proliferating at a near maximal rate (55%, range 40% to 75%, P less than 0.001). Because CFU-GM proliferation is nearly maximal in the baseline, noninfected state, neonates may have restricted ability to increase neutrophil production from CFU-GM during times of increased neutrophil need, such as during bacterial infection. Such inability may predispose neonates to exhaustion of the neutrophil supply during bacterial infection.\r"

We also studied the accuracy of transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) in estimating arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We compared pulse oximeter SaO2 with simultaneously measured SaO2 (range 78% to 100%) using a co-oximeter. Over a wide range of values for heart rate, blood pressure, hematocrit, PO2, PCO2, and pH, linear regression analysis revealed a close correlation between in vivo pulse oximeter readings and in vitro SaO2 measurements in patients with acute (r = 0.86, Y = 29.64 + 0.68X) and chronic (r = 0.91, Y = 6.29 + 0.96X) disease. Regression analysis of tcPO2 versus PaO2 showed an r value of 0.76 in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In these patients the mean difference between pulse oximeter SaO2 and in vitro SaO2 was 2.9% +/- 1.8% (SD), whereas the mean difference between tcPO2 and PaO2 was -14.5 +/- 11.1 mm Hg. Fetal hemoglobin ranged from 4.3% to 95%. We conclude that pulse oximetry is an appropriate alternative to tcPO2 for continuous oxygen monitoring in newborn infants with acute cardiorespiratory illnesses and chronic lung disease.\r"

Fifty children 9 to 12 years of age completed such instruments prior to clinical interview. Clinicians were blind as to the results of these questionnaires and administered a standard encopresis protocol to all patients. Six to 17 months later, 45 (90%) of the patient's parents were interviewed to assess compliance and treatment outcome. Children who significantly improved had a more internal locus of control (P less than 0.05) and better compliance (P less than 0.05) as determined by two separate outcome variables. Locus of control and compliance were not, however, significantly correlated with each other; each appeared to have an independent association with outcome. There was no association between perceived self-competence and outcome. The positive association between locus of control and outcome was not mediated by socioeconomic status, age, duration of encopresis, severity of encopresis, gender, or time between initiation of treatment and follow-up. Measurement of locus of control in children with encopresis appears to be helpful in identifing a group at high risk for resistance of treatment.\r"

We tested one lot of vaccine from each of three manufacturers (lots A and B, F-HA predominant type; lot C, PT-F-HA type). One hundred fifteen healthy children between the ages of 3 months and 23 months were immunized with one of the three lots of acellular pertussis vaccine to assess adverse reactions and antibody responses. The incidence of fever (temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) was 2.6% for lot A, 1.2% for lot B, and 2.5% for lot C. The incidence of local reactions greater than 5 cm in diameter was 1.9% for lot A, 2.4% for lot B, and 3.3% for lot C. Thus no significant differences in adverse reaction were observed. The anti-PT antibody responses in the tested vaccines were equal to or greater than those in patients with pertussis in the convalescent stage, and the anti-F-HA antibody responses were far higher than those of convalescing patients. Lot C produced the highest anti-PT antibody, and Lot A the highest anti-F-HA antibody.\r"

Between May 1975 and May 1985, the NWRSP screened 850,431 infants, detecting 192 infants with primary hypothyroidism (1:4429) and eight with hypopituitary hypothyroidism (1:106,304). In 11 additional infants, TSH deficiency, not detected by the screening program, was diagnosed on recognition of clinical features over the same period. Thyroid hormone treatment was begun in seven of the 11 infants prior to obtaining the screening sample results because of clinical symptoms of hypopituitarism, including hypoglycemia, persistent jaundice, microgenitalia, diabetes insipidus, midface hypoplasia, cleft lip or palate, or abnormalities of vision. The other four infants were not detected despite clinical features of hypopituitarism (in retrospect) and low serum T4 with TSH concentration below assay sensitivity on at least one screening sample. The most accurate assessment of total cases comes from Oregon, where all cases of congenital hypopituitarism are referred to our center; we estimate a frequency of 1:29,000. In our experience, a combination of newborn T4-supplemental TSH screening measurements and recognition of clinical features of hypopituitarism is the optimal strategy for detecting infants with congenital hypopituitary hypothyroidism.\r"

Twelve patients were born to mothers infected with LAV/HTLV III, and six were infected by blood products administered during the first weeks of life. Immunologic studies included lymphocyte markers, in vitro responses to mitogens and antigens with corresponding skin tests, and antibody response with isoagglutinins, post-vaccination antibodies, and Candida. A serologic profile of antibody to GP110, P18, and P25 LAV/HTLV III antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation assay was also performed. The antigen-induced proliferative responses were normal in 10 patients who had a stable course, but were profoundly impaired in eight others who died or had poor condition with opportunistic infections. These in vitro measurements were well correlated with antigen skin tests. An abnormal antibody response to antigens, a low level of isoagglutinins, and a peculiar profile of LAV/HTLV III antibodies were also frequently observed in these eight patients. These measurements appear to be of prognostic value because they were noticed soon after onset of clinical symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the prevalence of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in infants up to 3 months of age with suspected sepsis, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine specimens from 203 patients with clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis were cultured for Mycoplasma in addition to routine bacterial cultures. Proved bacterial infections were identified in 24 patients, four of whom had bacteremia. M. hominis and U. urealyticum were not isolated from any of the 191 blood and 199 CSF specimens tested. Of 170 specimens of urine cultured for Mycoplasma, M. hominis was isolated in six patients, U. urealyticum in nine patients, and both organisms in one patient. Twelve of the positive cultures were voided urine specimens, and four were suprapubic bladder aspiration specimens. Genital mycoplasmas appear to be uncommon causes of sepsis or meningitis in young infants. Further studies are required to assess their role in abnormal conditions of the urinary tract in childhood.\r"

Three had bilateral retinal hemorrhages, and three had visual impairment. MRI revealed bilateral subdural hematomas in all four children, but CT showed this in only one. Skull fractures in one patient were visualized by CT alone. MRI alone demonstrated posterior fossa bleeding in one patient and intraparenchymal bleeding in another; an additional patient in whom CT showed relatively diffuse atrophy also had defined areas of focal atrophy apparent on MRI. Subarachnoid hemorrhages were equally well detected using CT or MRI. Overall, MRI was superior to CT for detection of intracranial injury caused by shaking, and may help to document milder instances of this form of child abuse.\r"

Biopsies of these lesions showed histopathologic changes diagnostic of human papillomavirus infection, scored according to Reid's criteria. In one case, capsid antigen was detected with the peroxidase technique in the nuclei of the superficial cells. Past history and positive findings in the sexual partners of some of the patients suggested long-standing herpesvirus activity in the lower genital tract. In some cases of recalcitrant vulvodynia, colposcopic examination of the vulva and vagina may lead to a viral explanation for symptoms previously considered psychosomatic in origin.\r"

In a pregnant patient treated with mucous sodium heparin for deep vein thrombosis, recurrent heparin-induced thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred. Replacing the heparin with a different brand of the same drug resulted in reversal of the DIC and in clinical improvement. If severe heparin-induced thrombosis occurs in a patient in whom anticoagulation with other drugs is contraindicated, substituting one brand of heparin for another could be of value.\r"

Deans of student affairs at 124 U.S. medical schools were surveyed regarding composition of these letters at their institution. They were asked to describe themselves and the letters they write. Responses were received from 87 percent of these schools and provided data on types of information included in the letters, the decision to edit evaluations, student participation in the letter-writing process, use of final summary statements, cost and length of letters, and attitudes toward the development of national letter-writing guidelines. Major findings of the survey show that 97 percent of the writers allocated more space for clinical evaluations than basic science evaluations. Less than 50 percent of the writers included the student's class rank. Almost all included narrative evaluations of the student's performance during the clinical years. Negative information on students was addressed inconsistently by the writers. Eighty-five percent of the writers categorized their students in final summary statements, but many of these failed to provide descriptions of the categories used or explanatory data. The present authors make recommendations for writing more credible and useful letters.\r"

Traditional internal medicine programs relied almost exclusively on the consultation method and inpatient facilities, offered little formal instruction, used the psychiatrist as the primary teacher, and spent considerably less per resident for mental health training than the other programs. Psychologists and social workers as a group were the primary mental health teachers in family medicine residencies. Traditional internal medicine programs emphasized psychophysiological reactions and simple pharmacotherapy, while primary care internal medicine and family practice programs concentrated on life cycle issues, psychosocial awareness, and simple psychosocial management techniques. None of the three types of residencies focused on complex psychiatric disorders or management techniques. The three specialties differed significantly (F = 13, p = .0001) in the total amount of time on average the resident spent in formal mental health instruction. The need for evaluation of the outcome of training is also discussed.\r"

Residents of various specialties attended a mandatory short course on clinical teaching skills in the middle of their first year of postgraduate medical training. Three types of evaluation data were collected at three times during a two-year period: self-ratings by the residents, questionnaires completed by the residents, and ratings completed by students taught by the residents. Complete data for 18 residents indicated that the residents rated their teaching skills significantly higher after the course (at the end of both the first year and the second year) than before it. At the end of the second year, 94 percent of the residents stated that the course was helpful, 67 percent could recall and explain specific principles of teaching, and 61 percent reported using principles from the course in their teaching. Students' ratings of these 18 residents were too scanty to be interpreted validly. The study suggests that residents of varying specialties can profit from an introductory course on teaching skills and that the effects endure for at least one and a half years.\r"

A normal arteriogram was found in 55 of 72 patients (76.4%). The remaining 17 patients (23.6%) had arteriographic abnormalities that did not warrant surgery. Only one patient was explored (1.4%) for spasm of the popliteal artery. No vascular injury was found at surgery.

  ".W": "The responses of key liver carbohydrate intermediates to severe hemorrhage were investigated in fed and fasted young adult male rats. Forty per cent of intravascular blood was withdrawn and liver was sampled by freeze-clamp at 0, 0.25, 1.0, 3.0, and 4.0-5.0 hours. Fed rats with abundant glycogen showed a threefold increase in glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) concentration, and fasted rats showed a 75% decline in G6P immediately after hemorrhage. This significant difference in response traces to the fact that G6P is one of the first catabolites in fed liver formed by glycogenolysis but is the last intermediate of the gluconeogenic pathway in fasted animals. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the high-energy intermediate, was markedly depleted in both fed and fasted rats at zero time. In the fasted animal, however, the PEP was rapidly restored, and by 1.0 hour was threefold above normal. The ability of fasted rats to rapidly synthesize glucose from accumulated lactate is attributed to increased amount of gluconeogenic enzymes induced by fasting. In prolonged shock states, this synthetic capacity plays a protective role. Contrariwise, in brief shock states such as hemorrhage, the immediate availability of glucose from stored glycogen appears to be a more important determinant of survival. In the present experiments, fed rats were more resistant to the hemorrhage protocol.\r"

The reported use rate among drivers rose from 21% pre-legislation to 47% post-legislation (p less than 0.01). The use rate among front seat passengers rose from 21% to 40% (not significantly different due to the small number of occupants recorded in this position). A highway survey (Phase 3) noted the use rate in New York City and surrounding counties to be 63%, a marked increase from the published pre-legislation value of 16%. We conclude that mandatory seatbelt use legislation is effective in significantly increasing seatbelt use and urge physicians to seek similar legislation in every state.\r"

A complication rate of 14% is reported. Clinical use for the adult and pediatric patient is reported. The procedure is compared to the standard dissection tracheostomy method of Chevalier Jackson. This procedure has several advantages over the standard dissection method, the most significant of which appears to be the speed with which it can be performed. It can be done in 30 seconds, as opposed to the dissection procedure which requires 3 minutes or more for a surgeon to complete it. Autopsies on 14 of these patients are discussed. Long-term followup, that is for 1 year and more, is reported in 19 cases. Advantages of the percutaneous technique over the standard dissection technique are detailed.\r"

The flight crew recorded vital signs taken by the first responder capable of basic assessment. Entrapment and associated fatalities in motor vehicular accidents were recorded and flight logistics were examined. The presence of one or more abnormal signs identified a group of seriously injured trauma patients (mean Injury Severity Score = 29.1) with 24% mortality compared to a predicted mortality of 32% (p less than 0.02). Unresponsiveness to verbal stimulation in the field was the single most predictive criterion, yielding sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 85%. Time-distance criteria were helpful to determine helicopter use.\r"

  ".W": "During a recent 8-year period, 235 patients with documented blunt splenic trauma were treated. After exclusion of 39 patients with early deaths (19 dead on arrival, nine died in emergency room, and 11 died in operating room), the 196 remaining patients were treated in accordance with an evolving selective management program. Definitive management included splenectomy in 117 patients (59.7%), repair in 32 (16.3%), and nonoperative treatment in 47 (24%). A spectrum of blunt splenic trauma, as manifested by the degree of associated injuries (Injury Severity Scores), hemodynamic status, and blood transfusion requirements, was identified and permitted application of a rational selective management program that proved safe and effective for all age groups. Comparative analysis of the three methods of treatment demonstrated differences that were more a reflection of the overall magnitude of total bodily injury sustained rather than the specific manner in which any injured spleen was managed. Retrospective analysis of 19 nonoperative management failures enabled establishment of the following selection criteria for nonoperative management: absolute hemodynamic stability; minimal or lack of peritoneal findings; and maximal transfusion requirement of 2 units for the splenic injury. With operative management, splenorrhaphy is preferred, but it was often precluded by associated life-threatening injuries or by technical limitations. Of 42 attempted splenic repairs, ten (24%) were abandoned intraoperatively. There were no late failures of repair. In many cases of blunt splenic trauma, splenectomy still remains the most appropriate course of action.\r"

Nitrogen excretion was found to remain relatively stable or to rise in response to protein intake over a wide range of nonprotein calorie intakes. Urine urea nitrogen excretion was not related to caloric intake, but was correlated (p less than 0.04) with nitrogen intake. In this study protein conservation was not achieved by increasing caloric intake up to and beyond two times the basal energy expenditure in the brain-injured patient. In these patients nitrogen balance could only be achieved by nitrogen intakes in excess of the high protein catabolic rate. These findings argue for a central control mechanism for protein catabolism that is independent of the magnitude of peripheral tissue injury.\r"

To elucidate this issue, we reviewed 538 consecutive patients admitted with acute pelvic fracture during a 5-year period. Injury mechanism was motor vehicular in 214 (40%), falls in 152 (28%), auto-pedestrian in 92 (17%), motorcycle in 46 (9%), crush in 26 (5%), and assault or skiing in eight (1%). Ninety-two (17%) of these patients required greater than 6 units of blood transfusion during the first postinjury day, and are the primary focus of this report. Twenty-five patients (28%) had unilateral anterior (Group I, n = 20) or posterior (Group II, n = 5) fractures. The remaining 67 patients (72%) had anterior and posterior element involvement on the same side (Group II, n = 38), bilaterally (Group IV, n = 14), or open perineal wounds (Group V, n = 15). The PASG was applied in 47 patients (51%), and controlled hemorrhage in 12 (71%) of the 17 in whom it was used alone to tamponade pelvic bleeding. Peritoneal lavage was performed in 73 patients (79%). Initial aspirate yielded gross blood in 32 patients; 27 (84%) of these required urgent laparotomy. External skeletal fixation was applied in 19 patients; bleeding was controlled in 18 (95%). Pelvic angiography identified active hemorrhage in three patients and selective embolization was successful in two. Sixty-eight (74%) of the high-risk patients survived. Thirteen (54%) of the 24 deaths were attributable to the pelvic trauma, ten were due to recalcitrant bleeding, and three to delayed sepsis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 114 males and 30 females with a mean age of 28.6 years. The total time of followup was 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months). Indications for splenectomy were blunt trauma, 111 patients; penetrating trauma, six patients; and intra-operative injury, 27 patients. During the followup to date, 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization have occurred in 13 patients (9%). Fulminant pneumococcal sepsis resulted in the death of a 27-year-old male, 3 years after splenectomy. Septicemia occurred in four patients, pneumonia in five, abscess in two, infection of a prosthetic heart valve in one, meningitis in one, and fever of unknown origin in one. All but two of these infections were due to encapsulated organisms. Minor septic complications occurred in 44 patients (30%), and consisted of infections which required outpatient medical care. Major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (18.5% and 5.9% respectively; p less than 0.05). The mortality from major septic complications in this series (7%) is lower than previously reported by other investigators (30-80%). Our data suggest that adults undergoing splenectomy for trauma are at an increased risk of developing late major septic complications. This risk is significant enough to warrant attempts at splenic salvage, especially when injury is incidental to an elective operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arsenic was present in notable quantities in two preparations. Most sales personnel interviewed could not identify arsenic as being an ingredient in these preparations and were therefore incapable of warning the general public of possible dangers from ingestion. No such warnings appeared on the labels.\r"

  ".W": "Ex vivo renal artery surgery has been reported by several investigators and has extended the role of revascularization in the treatment of lesions previously managed by nephrectomy alone. Several techniques are available for use, and selection of the most appropriate method can be tailored to the specific anatomy being managed. Our total experience included 27 kidneys that have been managed by ex vivo renal artery reconstruction. Lesions managed in this manner include two kidneys with renal artery stenosis and renal tumors, one kidney with a congenital branch arteriovenous malformation, and 24 kidneys with branch occlusive or aneurysmal disease from fibromuscular dysplasia. Postoperative angiography was performed in 22 cases and defined successful revascularization without technical error in 20 cases. One operative death occurred as a result of myocardial infarction. One patient required reoperation to control bleeding, and two patients had temporary acute tubular necrosis during the postoperative period. Techniques employed included ex vivo repair with autotransplantation to the iliac system (six kidneys), mobilization and perfusion without transection of the renal vein (10 kidneys), and ex vivo perfusion and repair with replacement into the original renal fossa (11 kidneys). The authors believe this latter technique of reconstruction to be preferable to autotransplantation for the usual patient undergoing ex vivo repair of complex renovascular lesions.\r"

Forty-three patients had isolated venous injury; 31 of 43 patients (72%) underwent ligation to treat their vein injury. Another 141 patients had combined arterial and venous injury; 117 of these patients (83%) had ligation. Injured were the inferior vena cava, iliac, femoral, popliteal, distal leg, and arm veins; all patients underwent surgical exploration. Arterial injuries were repaired by standard techniques and venous injuries were either ligated or repaired by end-to-end or lateral phleborrhaphy. Adjunctive fasciotomy was used when clinically indicated. The patients were followed up for 1 month to 9 years. No permanent sequelae of venous ligation were identified. Transient extremity edema developed in up to 32% of patients, regardless of whether vein ligation or repair was performed. This edema resolved completely within 12 weeks of the injury. No extremity was lost after ligation of a venous injury. Although it may be ideal to repair all venous vascular injuries, selective management reflecting mechanism of injury, blood loss, anesthesia requirements, associated organ injury, and other concerns may mitigate against extensive venous repair.\r"

Eighteen patients referred for evaluation of asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques had a 50% incidence of ipsilateral carotid bifurcation disease, but only 16% of these were considered surgically remediable; five of these patients eventually required carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Nine of the 18 patients with asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques were further evaluated with serial ocular fundus photography: the plaque persisted in all nine patients--in four for more than 6 months and in five for more than 1 year. No patient had transient or fixed retinal or cerebral symptoms. Twenty-six patients with amaurosis fugax showed a 70% incidence of significant bifurcation disease and three had significant intracranial disease; 50% eventually required CEA. Twelve patients with fixed visual deficits (four patients had homonymous hemianopsia, four had retinal artery occlusions, and four had ischemic retinopathies) demonstrated a 100% incidence of bifurcation disease, but in addition 85% had significant intracranial disease; only one of this group had surgically amenable disease. Amaurosis fugax preceded blindness in two patients. Hollenhorst plaque as an isolated phenomenon appears to be a retinal embolic event of uncertain age, with poor predictive power for further embolic events, and not as highly correlated with significant or surgically amenabe carotid bifurcation disease.\r"

Unlike septic superficial vein thrombosis, venous excision is often associated with limb-threatening or even life-threatening complications. Some authors have suggested thrombectomy as the only means of resolving the sepsis. We reviewed our experience with seven patients who had septic deep vein thrombosis. Phlebography or noninvasive studies documented deep vein thrombosis and blood cultures were positive in all patients. The mean age was 31.5 years with a male/female ratio of 5:2. All patients were treated with anticoagulants and intravenous antibiotics. One patient required surgical exploration for associated abscess of the groin. The patients became afebrile with normal white blood cell counts from 3 to 18 days after therapy was begun. No cases of recurrent sepsis occurred. We conclude that antibiotic therapy and anticoagulation are adequate treatment and therefore consider venous thrombectomy unnecessary.\r"

  ".U": "87061271\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) have been followed up for 3 to 10 years (mean, 5.5 years). Seven patients have been lost to follow-up but none is recorded as dead (National Registry of Deaths) at least 5 years after operation. Fifteen patients (16.5%) have died, four from cerebral and eight from cardiac causes. Three patients had cerebral infarction with permanent deficits, one occurring immediately after operation, one at 3 months, and one at 9 years. Four patients had minor strokes but a full clinical recovery, three patients postoperatively and one patient at 4 years. Fourteen patients had ipsilateral TIAs, four occurred postoperatively and 10 occurred from 1 to 8 years later. Ten patients had contralateral TIAs and five patients then had a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Another nine patients also had bilateral operations, three for bilateral TIAs, five as prophylactic procedures on the basis of arteriographic findings, and one for a contralateral cerebral event that occurred after arteriography. Thus, at the mean follow-up time (5.5 years) and including the operative complications, four deaths (4%) of cerebral origin and seven serious cerebral problems (7%) have occurred--an annual morbidity and mortality rate of less than 2%. This compares favorably with the commonly predicted rate of stroke occurring after TIAs of 5% per year. These figures support the argument that carotid endarterectomy reduces the incidence of stroke occurring after TIA and stops TIAs caused by emboli from the carotid bifurcation.\r"

The thrombus culture was positive for Candida albicans, and the reestablishment of vein patency in conjunction with amphotericin B therapy resulted in cure.

An abdominal CT scan performed at that time showed extensive periaortic adenopathy. Isoniazid and rifampin were started, but both were stopped by the patient after less than 6 months of therapy. The patient later had night sweats, a left pleural effusion, and a tender abdominal mass thought to be a symptomatic aneurysm. At operation, the aorta was necrotic and had an inflammatory mass and perforation on the left side. Infrarenal aortic ligation and resection were performed to control infection. A previously placed axillofemoral graft obviated the need for concomitant revascularization. The patient was treated postoperatively with isoniazid and rifampin until hyperbilirubinemia developed, which necessitated alternate therapy with ethambutol and streptomycin. The patient died one month after operation of a presumed pulmonary embolus.\r"

After four weeks of therapy the 11 cyclosporine recipients had the following response to treatment: two had total clearing and six improved markedly, two moderately, and one minimally; whereas ten vehicle-treated patients showed no change or minimal improvement. Vehicle-treated patients, after a switch to cyclosporine for four weeks, demonstrated impressive improvement similar to that seen in patients who initially received only cyclosporine. Moderate or marked improvement or total clearing was noted in 17 (81%) of 21 and 20 (95%) of 21 after one and four weeks of therapy, respectively. Mitotic figures and leukotriene B4 levels in lesions decreased 86% and 64%, respectively, after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. Mononuclear (including activated T cells) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates were markedly reduced in lesions of all patients after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. These results suggest that psoriasis may have an immunologic basis mediated by activated T cells and/or other immune cells; if a long-term regimen with a favorable efficacy-side effect ratio can be determined, cyclosporine would be a significant advance in the treatment of psoriasis.\r"

To examine these patterns we analyzed over 25 million antibiotic prescriptions for treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease from 1966 through 1983, using the National Disease and Therapeutic Index. Most patients received a single antibiotic on an outpatient basis. Overall, use of natural penicillins declined markedly, and use of aminopenicillins more than doubled. Cephalosporins emerged as the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for hospitalized patients. Nationwide surveillance of treatment patterns may help to identify areas needing improvement through continuing education.\r"

As of May 1, 1986, a total of 922 (5.5%) of 16,748 adults with AIDS reported employment in such settings. Ninety-five percent of these health care workers belonged to recognized high-risk groups for AIDS; the proportion with \"no identified risk\" has not increased with time. All AIDS patients (including health care workers) who do not belong to high-risk groups are referred for further investigation. Of 88 health care workers initially reported with no identified risk, ten were from countries where heterosexual transmission is believed to play a major role; additional information was unobtainable or incomplete for 17 individuals. Of 61 persons on whom interviews or other follow-up information was obtained, 44 (73%) were reclassified. Specific occupational exposures that could be implicated as the source of human immunodeficiency virus infection were not identified for any health care workers with AIDS. A review of surveillance data supports other studies indicating that the risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission in the occupational setting is low.\r"

To account for baseline differences, analyses of covariance produced adjusted means for inpatient hospital costs, admissions, hospital days, outpatient costs, and other health costs. Mean annual inpatient cost increases were $43 and $42 for two Live for Life groups vs $76 for the non-Live for Life group. Live for Life groups also had lower rates of increase in hospital days and admissions. No significant differences were found for outpatient or other health care costs.\r"

  ".W": "To learn more about the metabolic effects of dietary fructose and sucrose, 12 type I and 12 type II diabetic subjects were fed three isocaloric (or isoenergic) diets for eight days each according to a randomized, crossover design. The three diets provided, respectively, 21% of the energy as fructose, 23% of the energy as sucrose, and almost all carbohydrate energy as starch. The fructose diet resulted in significantly lower one- and two-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels, overall mean plasma glucose levels, and urinary glucose excretion in both type I and type II subjects than did the starch diet. There were no significant differences between the sucrose and starch diets in any of the measures of glycemic control in either subject group. The fructose and sucrose diets did not significantly increase serum triglyceride values when compared with the starch diet, but both increased postprandial serum lactate levels. We conclude that short-term replacement of other carbohydrate sources in the diabetic diet with fructose will improve glycemic control, whereas replacement with sucrose will not aggravate glycemic control.\r"

Key elements to the diagnosis included a predominant eosinophilic response of the sinus mucosa, the presence of a characteristic mucoid exudate containing fungal hyphae, peripheral blood eosinophilia, serum precipitins against C lunata, elevated serum total and Curvularia-specific IgE and IgG concentrations, and immediate cutaneous reactivity to C lunata antigen. This report suggests that an exaggerated allergic response should be considered in the pathogenesis of pansinusitis. The presence of fungal hyphae in sinus mucosal specimens should alert the physician to the possibility of this disease. Sinus fungal cultures, as well as thorough immunologic evaluation, of such patients is recommended.\r"

In a prior study, we found that although imipramine had no effect on ejection fraction as measured by first-pass radionuclide angiography, the treatment could not be tolerated by 50% of the patients because of intolerable drug-induced orthostatic hypotension. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is an effective antidepressant that, in depressed patients without heart disease, causes significantly less orthostatic hypotension than imipramine. To see if this advantage could be safely extended to patients with congestive failure, we measured the effect of nortriptyline on ejection fraction and blood pressure in 21 depressed patients with left ventricular impairment. Ejection fraction was unchanged by nortriptyline treatment, and orthostatic hypotension developed in only one (5%) of 21 patients. Nortriptyline emerges as a relatively safe treatment for depression in patients with left ventricular impairment.\r"

There were 358 reactions occurring in 347 patients, for an overall reaction rate among patients of 2.2%. Each patient received a mean of eight different drugs. Rashes were attributed to 51 drugs, and 75% of the allergic cutaneous reactions were attributed to antibiotics, blood products, and inhaled mucolytics. Amoxicillin (51.4 reactions per 1000 patients exposed), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33.8/1000), and ampicillin (33.2/1000) had the highest reaction rates. Drug-specific reaction rates ranged from zero to 51.4 per 1000 and were determined for 180 drugs or drug groups. These results provide physicians with quantitative data that will be helpful in clinical decision making when drug-induced exanthems, urticaria, or generalized pruritus occurs.\r"

Although seven patients were ultimately weaned and survived for at least 24 hours, three of them subsequently died prior to discharge from the hospital. The remaining 39 patients died while using the ventilator. Patient age, tumor cell type, and the etiology of respiratory failure were not significantly different between the weaned and unweaned populations. A difference was noted in the duration of mechanical ventilation: none of the patients who could be weaned required mechanical ventilation for more than six days (range, two to six days). Respiratory failure in the nonsurgical lung cancer patient carries a poor prognosis, and selection of patients for mechanical ventilation should be conservative.\r"

Data for this study were derived by combining information retained by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates with ABIM data. Most FMGs who took the 1982 ABIM certifying examination for the first time were educated in and citizens of Asia, but a sizable minority were US citizens educated in Europe. Scores and program directors' ratings were lower for FMGs than US medical school graduates, and they attended different types of training programs. United States citizen FMGs were very similar to alien FMGs.

Increasingly, they must understand the nature of the socioeconomic environment of health care, including the extent of competition with other physicians and other health professionals; the degree of autonomy from health care institutions, government, and third-party payers; the impact of demographic or technological changes; and the economics of medical practice. This report analyzes the environment of medicine, emphasizing those elements that will be most important to medical students and resident physicians. It focuses on three stages of a physician's career: obtaining a medical education, beginning to practice medicine, and maintaining a viable practice.\r"

Campylobacter jejuni infection was recognized in all the ill students and caused asymptomatic infections in three others. In total, 22 (88%) of 25 students who consumed raw milk for the first time became infected as compared with none of two who had not consumed raw milk. Among ten persons who chronically consumed raw milk, none was ill, a striking difference from the 76% attack rate among the 25 acutely exposed students. The quantity of raw milk consumed was directly related to the occurrence and severity of illness. Acutely infected students showed significant rises in C jejuni-specific immunoglobulins, whereas the low antibody levels seen in unexposed persons did not rise. In contrast, acute-phase serum samples from persons with chronic exposure to raw milk showed elevated antibody levels to C jejuni. These findings indicate that chronic raw milk consumption is associated with elevated levels of C jejuni-specific serum antibodies and with immunity to symptomatic infection.\r"

Each had been interviewed by the same Admissions Committee, which earlier had selected 150 students through the traditional process. In contrasting the initially accepted and initially rejected groups, academic and demographic variables accounted for only 28% of group difference. The 72% of group difference not accounted for by the variables examined was presumed to relate to Admissions Committee preference. In attrition and in both preclinical and clinical performance through medical school and one year of postgraduate training, there were no meaningful differences between the groups. The observations suggest that the traditional interview process probably does not enhance the ability to predict performance of medical school applicants.\r"

A muscle biopsy specimen showed a vacuolar myopathy, and markedly decreased muscle carnitine content and carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity. Following recovery, muscle carnitine content was normal but carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was still abnormally low. The ratio of palmitoyl-coenzyme A plus carnitine to palmitoylcarnitine oxidation by muscle mitochondria isolated from the patient was markedly decreased. We conclude that transiently decreased muscle carnitine content interacted with partial deficiency of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-A to produce rhabdomyolysis and respiratory failure and that ibuprofen may have precipitated the clinical event.\r"

Forty percent of patients wanted physicians to address them by first name, but only 10% of patients wanted to address their physicians by first name. A concurrent mailed survey of 74 medical house staff members at the two hospitals revealed wide variability in physicians' attire and in how patients were addressed at each institution. Thus, many house officers had habits that were less formal than a substantial portion of their patients preferred.\r"

Most (93%) of the rats on the high protein diet died within three days following renal ischemia. In addition, 69% of the rats on normal protein diets also died, most before the fourth day following ischemic insult. In contrast, 88% of the rats on the low protein diet lived, although some exhibited elevated serum creatinine levels for up to one to two weeks following ischemia. Finally, all of the rats on no protein diets lived, and most (75%) exhibited normal serum creatinine levels by the fourth day following ischemia. Shifting the diets of high protein and normal protein adapted rats to no protein diets immediately following ischemia did not improve postischemic survival. Also, changing the diets of no protein adapted rats to high protein diets immediately following ischemia did not significantly affect postischemic recovery. When rats were maintained on no protein diets for shorter periods of time prior to ischemia, it was found that approximately a week on this diet is necessary to provide maximum protection from postischemic acute renal failure. These findings demonstrate a dramatic effect of dietary protein prior to ischemic induced acute renal failure, and suggests that preoperative dietary protein intake should be an important consideration in those situations which are predisposed to postoperative acute renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in patients on dialysis have shown that aluminum (Al) accumulation in bone plays a major role in the pathogenesis of osteomalacia. It has been suggested that deferoxamine (DFO) may be beneficial in the treatment of aluminum-induced osteomalacia. The present studies were performed in four groups of uremic rats to determine if DFO and/or discontinuation of Al administration have an effect on bone histomorphometry and blood chemistries. The groups were: 1) uremic control 2) aluminum (0.75 to 1.0 mg/rat i.p., five times a week for twelve weeks): 3) aluminum + DFO, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats received DFO (75 mg/rat two times a week for nine weeks); 4) aluminum + time, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats were sacrificed after nine weeks. High levels of Al in serum and bone and low levels of PTH were seen in rats receiving Al. Bone histology revealed Al at the mineralization front, abnormal tetracycline uptake, and an increase in osteoid. DFO treatment did not significantly change the level of Al in bone, however both DFO treatment and discontinuation of Al reversed towards normal the above described lesions. In conclusion, these studies suggest that DFO and/or discontinuation of Al administration to rats with approximately 30% of renal function greatly improve aluminum-induced osteomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "Proximal straight tubules (PST) has been shown to be an important nephron segment of renal ammonia production. To clarify the nature of glutamine (substrate of ammonia production) transport in PST, both luminal resorption and peritubular uptake of glutamine were measured in isolated rabbit PST. Luminal glutamine resorption (Jgln) was measured at various perfusate glutamine concentration (0.05 to 20 mM) at 38 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Jgln measured at 12 degrees C were proportional to mean luminal glutamine concentrations. This flux was thought to be a passive glutamine flux. The flux, which was obtained by subtracting passive glutamine flux from Jgln obtained at 38 degrees C, was thought to be active luminal resorption. This flux exhibited saturation kinetics (Vmax 20.9 pmol min-1 X mm-1, km 5.2 mM). When bath pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8, Jgln showed no change or a small decrease (12%) at perfusate glutamine concentrations of 0.05 or 5 mM, respectively. When perfusate pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8 Jgln showed a small decrease (10%) at 5 mM perfusate glutamine concentration. Peritubular glutamine uptake was determined in isolated nonperfused PST incubated for 5 to 50 min in [14C]-glutamine containing solution. When incubated in pH 7.4 HCO3 buffer solution, cell to medium 14C concentration ratio was higher than unity (3.83 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.001) at 5 min, and reached a maximum (11.37 +/- 1.13) at 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In animals which suffered no change in these metabolites during hypotension, retransfusion immediately restored normal renal function. When metabolite changes were observed during hypotension, they occurred suddenly with severe ATP depletion, Pi accumulation, and intracellular acidosis occurring almost concurrently. Metabolic changes of this magnitude were always associated with renal dysfunction in the post-hypotensive period, which occurred even when the period of biochemical change was only 10 to 15 minutes. The abnormalities in post-hypotensive renal function resemble the pattern of change seen in human acute tubular necrosis (ATN): depressed glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine output varying from polyuria to oliguria, decreased urine to plasma inulin ratio, increased urinary sodium concentration, increased fractional excretion of sodium, and increased fractional excretion of potassium. It is postulated that changes in renal cellular energy status during hemorrhagic hypotension distinguish pre-renal failure from early or incipient ATN.\r"

  ".W": "The split hydronephrotic kidney preparation was used to directly observe the effects of locally applied dopamine on the in vivo diameters of renal vessels. Dopamine (1 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) M) produced a concentration-dependent dilation of the arcuate and interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles. Efferent arterioles near the glomeruli also dilated to dopamine but the dilation was less than that of the preglomerular vessels. Higher dopamine concentrations (3 X 10(-4) and 1 X 10(-3) M) produced more variable effects, with a tendency for the arcuate and interlobular arteries and the afferent and efferent arterioles away from the glomeruli to decrease in diameter. After pretreatment with haloperidol, dopamine (1 X 10(-6) to 1 X 10(-4) M) did not dilate any pre- or postglomerular vascular segment, but the tendency for pre- and postglomerular constrictions with higher dopamine concentrations were not abolished. Pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol enhanced the dilator response of the pre- and postglomerular vessels (except the afferent arterioles near glomeruli and efferent arterioles near welling points) to dopamine (3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M), and abolished the reductions in diameter produced by the high dopamine levels. These data indicate that the dilator effect of dopamine is mediated by interactions with specific dopaminergic receptors, while alpha and beta adrenergic receptors appear to mediate a constrictor influence observed with high dopamine concentrations. The overall effect of dopamine on the renal vessel diameters thus appears to depend on the balance of dilator and constrictor stimuli mediated by multiple receptors.\r"

Twelve patients underwent bone biopsy immediately prior to and after one year of such treatment. Those with larger quantities of non-mineralized bone matrix (osteoid) experienced a reduction in relative osteoid volume, mean osteoid seam width, and total osteoid surface. Moreover, the use of time-spaced kinetic markers of mineralization (tetracycline) enabled us to demonstrate that CAPD usually decreased the amount of non-mineralized bone matrix by shortening mineralization lag time (that is, the interval from organic matrix deposition to its mineralization). The changes in the histomorphology appeared to occur independently of bone aluminum. These data indicate that CAPD generally enhances the mineralizing capacity of individual osteoblasts and suggests that such therapy is beneficial to the uremic skeleton.\r"

Unknown solute(s) retained in renal failure have been extracted from uremic fluids. When added to normal plasma they induce a similar binding defect. Similar activity can be extracted from normal urine. We have devised a series of extraction and purification techniques that yielded three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine in sufficient quantity and of a high degree of purity. Rigorous methods have been applied to determine chemical identity of the ligands. Purification steps consisted of: adsorption at pH 3.0 to polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2); elution from the resin with methanol followed by drying and solution in dilute formic acid; passage through SP-Sephadex to remove cations, especially yellow-brown pigments; adsorption to the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex, and separation into three zones of inhibitory activity with a formic acid gradient; purification to homogeneity with C-8 or C-18 silica reversed-phase chromatography. Using this isolation procedure, followed by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have shown that the binding inhibitory activity is due not to one ligand, but to a family of aromatic acids. To date hippurate, beta-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-hydracrylate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate have been identified as binding inhibitors. Other active ligands remain to be identified.\r"

  ".W": "Non-excretor cirrhotic patients, defined by their inability to normally excrete a standard water load, display variable responses to head-out water immersion. The hemodynamic, hormonal, and renal functional status of fifteen such patients were analyzed relative to water excretion during head-out water immersion. Group 1 patients (N = 7) all excreted less than 40% of the water load during immersion, whereas excretion was greater than 40% in all eight patients in Group 2. Group 1 patients, when compared with Group 2, had more ascites, more diuretic resistance, lower serum sodium concentration (125 +/- 2 vs. 130 +/- 1 mEq/liter, P less than 0.05), and more impaired baseline water excretion (12.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 35.9 +/- 5.9% of water load in 5 hr, P less than 0.005). Systemic hemodynamic responses to water immersion were similar in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were significantly more impaired in Group 1 patients (inulin clearance 28 +/- 6 vs. 62 +/- 9 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.05; para-aminohippurate clearance 212 +/- 35 vs. 357 +/- 37 ml/min, P less than 0.05). Concentrations of plasma vasopressin (1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1 pg/ml, P less than 0.05), renin (8.6 +/- 1.7 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.9 ng/ml/hr, P less than 0.05), aldosterone (82 +/- 14 vs. 39 +/- 10 ng/dl, P less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (1155 +/- 183 vs. 603 +/- 126 pg/ml, P less than 0.05) were all significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 2 patients during water immersion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis (six with uric acid stones alone and 12 with both uric acid and calcium stones) underwent long-term treatment (1 to 5.33 years, mean of 2.78 years) with potassium citrate (30 to 80 mEq/day, usually 60 mEq/day). Urinary pH increased from low (5.30 +/- 0.31 SD) to normal (6.19 to 6.46) during treatment. Urinary content of undissociated uric acid, which was high to begin with at 204 +/- 82 mg/day, decreased to the normal range (64 to 108 mg/day) following treatment. Urinary citrate rose from 503 +/- 225 mg/day to 852 to 998 mg/day. Urinary saturation of calcium oxalate significantly declined with potassium citrate treatment. New stone formation rate declined from 1.20 +/- 1.68 stones/year to 0.01 +/- 0.04 stones/year (P less than 0.001 by chi square). Remission was experienced in 94.4% of patients, and the group stone formation rate declined by 99.2%. Detailed case reports were obtained in five patients showing different responses between sodium alkali and potassium alkali treatment. All five patients had persistently low urinary pH (typically less than 5.5) and normouricosuria, and four had hyperuricemia. Before treatment, they had stones surgically removed or spontaneously passed, which were pure uric acid in composition. When sodium alkali was give (as bicarbonate or citrate, 60 to 118 mEq/day), new stone formation continued in four patients, and a radiolucent (uric acid) calculus become \"calcified\" in the remaining patient. The stone analysis disclosed calcium oxalate in five patients and calcium phosphate in three patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We recently tested the device in vivo and found this not to be so, based on the device's ability to eliminate substances of a MW of 10,000 to 60,000 daltons. One of the reasons for this discrepancy was found to be the influence of secondary membrane formation on solute permeability. Endogenous marker substances of a defined MW (beta 2-microglobulin, myoglobin, RBP, alpha 1-microglobulin, acid alpha 1-glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, prealbumin, and albumin were measured by laser nephelometry or radioimmune assay; sieving coefficients (SC) and protein eliminations were calculated for each low MW protein.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between proteinuria, focal sclerosis, and tubulo-interstitial changes in the evolution of renal damage in experimental nephrosis. We utilized an accelerated unilateral model of adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis characterized by morphological changes more severe than in the classical model. The first events in ADR-induced glomerulopathy were epithelial cell damage and proteinuria. Subsequently, tubular casts were formed at the distal level. The cast formation preceded the development of interstitial damage, which was determined by tubular obstruction and breaking of tubular basement membrane (TBM), which in turn promoted an interstitial inflammatory reaction. Despite the severity of tubulo-interstitial damage observed after a long period of heavy proteinuria, the incidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSG) was very low. The results of the present study indicate that chronic proteinuria is not necessarily accompanied by the development of focal sclerosis. Tubulo-interstitial lesions appear to be the most important determinant for the progression of renal damage in this model.\r"

  ".U": "87062044\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium absorption in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has been reported to be increased, decreased or not different from their normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKy) control. One postulated reason for these conflicting results is an abnormal sensitivity to the intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D3). Previous studies in everted duodenal sacs and perfused duodenum examined the acute response to 1,25D3 only in 12-week-old SHR, which however already had higher basal rates of calcium absorption. Inability to stimulate Ca absorption further was an unexcluded possibility. To test this hypothesis more vigorously, balance and in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake studies were performed in SHR and WKy using four separate protocols yielding the following results. First, in response to pharmacological doses of 1,25D3 (25 ng/100 g body wt/day X 3), four-week-old normotensive female SHR had higher net calcium absorption (41.4 vs. 31.1 mg/day; 61.6 vs. 48.1%), similar to the increases seen in the untreated state. These results suggest intrinsic epithelial differences independent of 1,25D3. Ca absorption was similarly higher in 1,25D3 treated male SHR (42.9 vs. 36.7 mg/day; 60.1 vs. 53.7%). Second, at 12 to 14 weeks of age, low doses of 1,25D3 (8 ng/100 g body wt/day X 6) stimulated net Ca absorption in the female SHR (33.0 to 39.1 mg/day), but not in WKy (26.8 to 29.3 mg/day). In the male, positive effects were again seen only in the SHR (25 to 45 mg/day). Third, in response to three weeks of dietary Ca deprivation, in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake, measured in the conscious awake state, was higher in 35-week-old SHR (70.9 vs. 53.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intravenous (i.v.) and intracarotid (IC) angiotensin II (AII) infusion on systemic and renal hemodynamics, renal water excretion, and plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels were examined in six conscious dogs under water loaded and hydropenic conditions. In the first group of seven studies, AII in a mean dose of 12.7 ng/kg/min was administered i.v. to water loaded dogs. The infusion induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP, 99 to 118 mm Hg, P less than 0.001), and significant reductions in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 67 to 57 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and para-aminohippurate clearance (CPAH, 280 to 212 ml/min, P less than 0.005) occurred. Despite this decrement in renal hemodynamics, urine remained maximally dilute (Uosm, 58 to 61 mOsm/kg H2O, NS). Furthermore, plasma ADH was suppressed maximally after water load and did not increase after i.v. AII infusion. The IC infusion of AII (mean dose 5.8 ng/kg/min) produced similar changes in hemodynamics; plasma ADH remained undetectable. When AII was administered i.v. to hydropenic animals (mean dose 8.3 ng/kg/min), MAP again increased (86 to 111 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) as GFR (81.3 to 68.6 ml/min, NS) and CPAH (291 to 223 ml/min, P less than 0.05) declined modestly. In these animals, Uosm decreased significantly (1429 to 1114 mOsm/kg H2O, P less than 0.005) and plasma ADH did not change significantly (1.66 to 1.88 pg/ml, NS). When IC AII (4 ng/kg/min) was repeated in hydropenic dogs pretreated with indomethacin, neither Usom (1787 to 1664 mOsm/kg H2O, NS) nor plasma ADH were altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
