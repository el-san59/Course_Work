  ".W": "The feasibility of delivering therapeutically useful amounts of oxygen percutaneously was investigated in 13 preterm infants. Their gestation ranged from 25 to 31 weeks and all were being ventilated for severe respiratory distress. Raising the ambient oxygen concentration resulted in an increase in arterial oxygen tension of 4.5 to 13.8 mm Hg (mean 8.9 mm Hg) as a result of percutaneous oxygen absorption. The change was greatest in the least mature infants and in those with the weakest epidermal barrier. Transdermal oxygen therapy can usefully supplement oxygen delivery to very premature infants with poor pulmonary gas exchange.\r"

On admission, the average blood methanol concentration was 20 mmol/l (64 mg/dl) and blood ethanol concentration was 39 mmol/l (179 mg/dl). Although these patients were not treated with ethanol, and methanol concentrations remained high as blood ethanol concentrations fell to zero, no acidosis or other signs of classic methanol poisoning developed. The rate of metabolism of methanol was correlated to the initial ethanol concentration. To avoid unnecessary invasive therapy, treatment of methanol poisoning should be based on the case history, clinical signs, and laboratory features-not solely on blood methanol concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of the 220,540 births and 2152 perinatal deaths recorded in Switzerland between 1979 and 1981 showed a variation of perinatal mortality rates (PMR) according to the hour of birth. The PMR for babies born between 4 pm and 2 am was 12 per 1000, contrasting with a figure of 8.4 per 1000 for babies born between 2 am and 4 pm. This pattern, which was fairly constant throughout the week, was characterised by a slow and steady increase from the very early morning, reaching a maximum in the late evening. There was also an hour-to-hour variation in the proportion of babies born weighing less than 2500 g, with a maximum in the evening and a less pronounced peak in the morning: the mortality rates by birthweight were raised only in the evening. Since the availability of hospital staff and equipment also follows a circadian rhythm, the variation in PMR may be related to a circadian rhythm of quality of care or possibly to chronobiological or selection factors.\r"

Stools were examined weekly in the 6 months after treatment to determine the rate of reinfection, and after reinfection stools continued to be examined. 98% of the children became reinfected with Giardia lamblia within 6 months, and after reinfection stool excretion of the parasite lasted a mean (SD) of 3.2 (3.3) months. The children's mean stool pH and their mean stool fat index was unaffected by Giardia lamblia reinfection. Treatment of all symptomless Giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid reinfection.\r"

CD4+ cell counts increased in 14/18 treated subjects and 1/7 untreated subjects. No disease progression was observed in either group. Regression of enlarged lymph nodes was seen in the zidovudine-treated subjects. Adverse reactions to the study drugs were infrequent and mild.

Mean (SD) standardised walking distance increased from 79.9 (71.9) to 152.6 (89.7) m (p less than 0.0001); doppler index improved from 0.58 (SD 0.17) to 0.81 (0.16) (p less than 0.0001); performance on bicycle stress test rose from 276.3 (range 1-1100) to 584.8 (2-2250) watt-min; and index for 201Tl-scintigraphy of the lower leg increased from 0.68 (0.28) to 0.91 (0.36) (p less than 0.02). The improvement has been maintained for 6 months, the degree of stenosis on repeat angiography at 2-6 months (n = 14 lesions) being 20.7 (SD 13.7)% (unchanged from early post-treatment values). The only restenosis has been corrected by a repeat of the percutaneous procedure.\r"

Neither patient had pre-existent cardiac disease. In both patients haemodynamic assessment, radionuclide ventriculography, and two-dimensional echocardiography confirmed the clinical impression of profound systolic myocardial dysfunction. Haemodynamic stability was attained by intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, which was probably life-saving in both cases. Cardiac function improved rapidly although some contractile depression persisted for several days. At follow-up both patients had normal cardiac function with no evidence of underlying heart disease.\r"

All patients were also given domperidone. The 11 patients treated by infusion showed marked and sustained improvement, and their mean duration of daily off periods over a period of 15 months fell by 6.3 h; similar results were obtained in 8 patients with less severe disabilities who were given repeated apomorphine injections. The therapeutic response to apomorphine was similar to that seen with intravenous levodopa; in patients treated by infusion the mean daily levodopa dose was reduced by 209 mg. These results confirm that during off periods dopamine receptors remain responsive to stimulation and provide evidence of a new, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for the most disabling complication of long-term levodopa therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Since early 1985, blood donations in the United States have been screened for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To identify instances of HIV transmission by antibody-negative donations, we investigated 13 persons seropositive for HIV who had received blood from 7 donors who were screened as negative for HIV antibody at the time of donation. Twelve of the 13 recipients had no identifiable risk factors for HIV infection other than the transfusions they had received. On evaluation 8 to 20 months after transfusion, HIV-related illnesses had developed in three recipients, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome had developed in one. All seven donors were found to be infected with HIV. On interview, six reported a risk factor for HIV infection, and five had engaged in high-risk activities or had had an illness suggestive of acute retroviral syndrome within the four months preceding their HIV-seronegative donation. Thus, these donors had apparently been infected only recently, and so were negative at the time of blood donation according to available antibody tests. We conclude that there is a small but identifiable risk of HIV infection for recipients of screened blood. To minimize this risk, the reasons for deferral of donation need to be communicated more effectively to blood donors who are at high risk of HIV infection, and new assays that detect HIV infection earlier should be evaluated for their effectiveness in screening donated blood.\r"

We studied 47 persons at 50 percent risk of inheriting Huntington's disease who requested a presymptomatic or prenatal genetic-linkage test between September 1986 and January 1988. The participants were given pre-test counseling and psychological and neurologic evaluations. Nineteen persons later voluntarily withdrew from the protocol, including one who would have been excluded anyway, and one person was from a family that was too small to allow testing. Three D4S10 restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms produced by the HindIII, EcoRI, and Bg/I enzymes were used for all tests, and the probability that a subject was a Huntington's disease carrier was calculated. The accuracy of the test was compromised by a 4 percent recombination frequency between D4S10 and the Huntington's disease gene. Fifteen presymptomatic tests and one prenatal test were completed. Four yielded positive results, seven yielded negative results, and five were uninformative; seven persons are awaiting test results. All participants with positive tests experienced intermittent depression, but none required hospitalization, and no suicide threats were reported. Five participants received a diagnosis of Huntington's disease on the basis of the neurologic assessment. We conclude that some persons in the early stages of Huntington's disease may seek presymptomatic testing rather than neurologic evaluations.\r"

Among the matched pairs of subjects, zoster occurred in 3 (3.6 percent) of the 84 vaccinated subjects during 2936 months of observation--an incidence of 1.23 cases per 100 person-years--and in 11 (13.1 percent) of the subjects with natural infection during 4245 months--an incidence of 3.11 cases of zoster per 100 person-years. Although the incidence of zoster was more than twice as high in the control children as in the vaccinated children (3.11 vs. 1.23 cases per 100 person-years), a Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis revealed no significant differences in incidence between the two groups. Children from both groups in whom leukemia recurred were more likely to contract zoster than those who did not have a recurrence (7 of 35 vs. 7 of 133, P less than 0.025). Zoster was not a marker for impending relapse. No case of zoster was severe or disseminated. We conclude that the incidence of zoster following immunization with live attenuated varicella vaccine is no greater than that following natural varicella infection.\r"

  ".U": "88122547\r", 
  ".W": "The recently identified theta-globin gene subfamily consists of the theta 1-globin gene located downstream from the alpha 1-globin gene, and several other members including at least one truncated, processed pseudogene psi theta 2 (refs 1,6). Unlike the theta 1-globin genes of the rabbit and galago, the structure of these genes in the orangutan and baboon and their flanking regions show no apparent defects that would prevent their expression. Both theta 1-globin genes are split into three exons with the potential to code for a polypeptide of length 141 amino acids. Besides differing by 26% in replacement-site substitutions, the theta 1 and alpha 1-globin genes of the orangutan and baboon also differ in their promoter structures, in the use of TGA versus TAA as the termination codon, and in the use of AGTAAA versus AATAAA as the polyadenylation signal. In contrast, the two theta 1-globin genes from primates only differ by 1.7% in the replacement-site substitutions. Here we present the complete DNA sequence of a cloned theta 1-globin gene of humans, and show that it contains no apparent defects that would abolish its expression. Furthermore, by primer extension of single-stranded oligonucleotide probes, we show that the theta 1-globin gene of humans is transcribed in an erythroleukemia cell line K562. Three messenger RNA species were detected, with 5'-ends mapping to approximately 70 base pairs (bp) downstream from a TATA promoter sequence, at 8 bp downstream from a GGGCGG promoter sequence and at 40 bp upstream from the ATG inititrion codon, respectively. Haemin treatment of the K562 cells slightly enhances the level of the longest theta 1-transcript. Our results provide strong evidence that the theta 1-globin gene of humans is transcriptionally active in cells of erythroid origin, and suggests the presence of a functional theta 1-polypeptide in specific cells, possibly those of early erythroid tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Tumour promoters induce a wide spectrum of morphological and biochemical alterations when applied to mouse epidermis in vivo. These include the induction of RNA, DNA and protein synthesis during discrete phases of proliferation and differentiation. This constitutes an ideal model for studying molecular events underlying the disruption of epidermal homeostasis by TPA, and its subsequent re-establishment. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can induce either growth stimulation, inhibition, or differentiation, depending on the target cell. A function has been proposed for TGF-beta in wound healing and in tumour promotion, but the main source of TGF-beta is generally thought to be platelets, macrophages or lymphocytes, and a direct role for this growth factor in regulating tissue homeostasis in vivo has not been demonstrated. We show here that when the tumour promoter 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is applied to the skin of mice, very high levels of TGF-beta messenger RNA are induced in the epidermal cells. In situ hybridization techniques show that the main site of TGF-beta synthesis is in the suprabasal differentiating epidermal cells. These results suggest that TGF-beta may be a natural regulator of epidermal homeostasis which is important in tumour promotion.\r"

A putative A4 amyloid precursor (herein termed A4(695] has been characterized by analysis of a human brain complementary DNA. We report here the sequence of a closely related amyloid cDNA, A4(751), distinguished from A4(695) by the presence of a 168 base-pair (bp) sequence which adds 57 amino acids to, and removes one residue from, the predicted A4(695) protein. The peptide predicted from this insert is very similar to the Kunitz family of serine proteinase inhibitors. The two A4-specific messenger RNAs are differentially expressed: in a limited survey, A4(751) mRNA appears to be ubiquitous, whereas A4(695) mRNA has a restricted pattern of expression which includes cells from neuronal tissue. These data may have significant implications for understanding amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Recent molecular genetic studies have indicated that amyloid protein is encoded as part of a larger protein by a gene on human chromosome 21 (refs 6-9). The amyloid protein precursor (APP) gene is expressed in brain and in several peripheral tissues, but the specific biochemical events leading to deposition of amyloid are not known. We have now screened complementary DNA libraries constructed from peripheral tissues to determine whether the messenger RNA encoding APP in these tissues is identical to that expressed in brain, and we identify a second APP mRNA that encodes an additional internal domain with a sequence characteristic of a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. The alternative APP mRNA is present in both brain and peripheral tissues of normal individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease, but its pattern of expression differs from that of the previously reported APP mRNA.\r"

Here we describe the isolation of two molecular clones from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and their use to derive restriction endonuclease maps of five SIV isolates from rhesus macaques and one from a cynomolgus macaque. Although similar, all six viral isolates are readily distinguishable; the single isolate from a cynomolgus macaque is the most different. The restriction endonuclease map of one macaque isolate (SIVMAC-251) is identical to that published by others for STLV-IIIAGM of African green monkeys and for HTLV-IV of humans. Nucleotide sequences from the envelope region of cloned SIVMAC-251 have more than 99% identify to previously published sequences for STLV-IIIAGM (refs 2, 4) and HTLV-IV (ref. 4). These results and other observations provide strong evidence that isolates previously referred to as STLV-IIIAGM and HTLV-IV by others are not authentic, but were derived from cell cultures infected with SIVMAC-251.\r"

Half of the animals were given an injection of MPG before irradiation, while the other rats were injected with saline solution.

The average lengths and percentage depths of the apicoincisal niches were statistically smaller in the groups treated with MPG.

Statistically significant differences between EPT results for the same teeth with the operator's hands being gloved and ungloved were noted. However, the mean differences in EPT results were small and were thought to be diagnostically insignificant for clinical situations. As long as the patient \"completes the circuit\" by also holding the metallic handle of the electric pulp tester's probe, dentists can easily, reliably, and accurately use the EPT while wearing examination gloves.\r"

In the present study we evaluated the frequency and nature of oral problems associated with cancer treatment in 495 patients treated for non-head-and-neck malignancies between 1978 and 1986. Our analysis indicates that the frequency of oral problems in the study population was 10.5%, compared to 38.7% in 1978. The specific nature and distribution of oral problems by diagnosis, by patient's age, and by type were remarkably consistent.

MR generally proved to be superior to CT in the evaluation of recurrent disease because of its ability to differentiate tissues on the basis of their proton composition. CT images reflect the electron densities of tissues. Hence, interpreting inflammatory and postsurgical changes and differentiating them from neoplasm may be difficult. At the present time, familiarity with CT dictates that the MR evaluation complement and not substitute the CT evaluation.\r"

A total of thirteen of fourteen (93%) of the seropositive men and twenty-six of fifty-two (50%) of the HIV seronegative men had culture-confirmed oral candidiasis. In the latter group, oral candidiasis was clearly correlated to cigarette smoking. Clinical mucosal changes other than candidiasis were found in forty-five of the sixty-six subjects studied. The most frequent finding was trauma resulting from biting, which was usually localized on the cheek. Leukoplakia was found in twelve of sixty-six subjects, while cauliflower-like condylomas were present in 4 persons. The results emphasize the frequent occurrence of different oral lesions in subjects seropositive for HIV and in those at high risk for HIV infection. Oral examination in search for potential early manifestations of HIV infection in homosexual men is advocated.\r"

At the time of examination, 69 of the 72 monkeys exposed to SRV-1 had serologic and/or virologic evidence of SRV-1 infection. None of the 81 control monkeys had any evidence of infection with SRV-1. Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), oral yeast infections, and noma occurred in 10% (p less than 0.01), 4%, and 1%, respectively, of the study group of 72 animals but were found in none of the control animals. Thus, ANUG occurs rather frequently in rhesus monkeys with evidence of SRV-1 infection. The reproducible immunodeficiency that follows inoculation of SRV-1 in rhesus monkeys promises to be a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of ANUG associated with immunodeficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Oncocytic adenocarcinoma of salivary gland origin is an extremely rare neoplasm. The diagnosis is established on the basis of oncocytic cellular features in conjunction with dysplastic change. These dysplastic changes may occur in benign oncocytomas or arise de novo. The tumor occurs most commonly in the parotid glands of persons over 60 years of age. Tumors that measure less than 2 cm at the initial surgical procedure appear to have a better prognosis than larger tumors. Aggressive surgical intervention at the initial presentation of the neoplasm, compared to simple enucleation, seems to offer a more favorable prognosis. Recurrence is an ominous feature. Metastasis, when it occurs, is widespread.\r"

It may be secondary to a number of primary causes, which include renal failure, oxalate poisoning, malabsorption syndromes, and in this case, ileojejunal bypass surgery. Systemic oxalate overload following such bypass surgery results from a defect in the enterohepatic circulation and from the loss of calcium and bile salts in the feces. The oxalate is then absorbed into the circulation, and the supersaturated solution precipitates in the systemic tissues. Reported cases of oral involvement are rare. This article presents a 2 1/2-year follow-up of such a patient and the resultant progressive and unrelenting nature of the disorder. As a result of our experience, we suggest early aggressive oral surgical management of the widespread oral lesions.\r"

To investigate whether corrosion had occurred on the silver cones, the cones were also examined with the scanning electron microscope and the electron microprobe. Our observations revealed that all the examined silver cones showed different degrees of corrosion on their surfaces, whereas different concentrations of silver, sulfur, and chlorine were detected at the same sites in the cytologic imprints. However, it is impossible to determine from this study whether the presence of corrosive by-products in the periapical tissues is responsible for the development of a pathologic reaction at these sites.\r"

Compared to normal values (9.6 +/- 3.2 fmol/ml), all the patients had elevated CSF levels of SP (36.1 +/- 2.7 fmol/ml, range 16.5-79.1 fmol/ml). Anamnestic information from the patients revealed that 53.3% had Raynaud/Raynaud-like phenomenon localized in the fingers, the toes or both. Although SP levels did not differ significantly in patients with or without the Raynaud phenomenon, elevated activity may be present in the peripheral branches of SP neurons which could be responsible for the last (rubor) phase of the triphasic Raynaud's phenomenon. SP levels were significantly higher in patients who were smokers (40.1 +/- 2.7 fmol/ml, range 25.3-64.1 fmol/ml), compared to patients who were non-smokers (29.2 +/- 5.0 fmol/ml, range 16.5-79.1 fmol/ml). We propose elevated CSF levels of SP and the Raynaud phenomenon as characteristic features for fibromyalgia with potential as diagnostic markers of the disease and further that smoking might be an aggravating factor for its pathogenesis or development.\r"

Additional studies in which these methodologic flaws are overcome must be carried out if we are to understand truly when and how cultural concepts of beauty are acquired. Nevertheless, the majority of the studies already done find that children acquire prevailing cultural values of beauty before adolescence and that thinness is desirable to girls considerably before puberty. It is suggested that the etiology of eating disorders and the reasons for their increasing prevalence will not be discovered by studying only clinical cases. We propose that those interested in this important health problem study children before adolescence in an attempt to learn how preoccupation with weight begins and why thinness is believed to be attractive. Once these are understood, a greater challenge will be the development and testing of interventions--be they in the schools or using the media--which can effectively prevent this public health problem. When culture and biology clash, people may suffer.\r"

  ".W": "A laser-microprobe fluorescence/Raman spectrometer with a 700-channel detector has been constructed and applied to the collection of data on the distribution of a green fluorophor throughout the exposed area of a human lens sectioned along the visual axis. The area (approximately 6.5 X 9.5 mm) covering the lens section was scanned automatically by the microprobe programmed to measure the fluorescence intensity at 1200 data points. The spectrometer output was accumulated in a microcomputer and displayed as a three-dimensional perspective view showing the fluorescence intensity at each point on the grid. The method permits the precise and detailed mapping at high resolution of the spatial distribution of a fluorophor or Raman-emissive constituent in a plane of the frozen lens to give results not obtainable by any other feasible procedure. The green fluorophor (441.6 nm, excitation wavelength; 520 nm, peak emission wavelength) has a distribution indicating a metabolic rather than a photochemical mode of production. Moreover, the lower level of fluorophor in the anterior segment suggests the existence of mechanisms in the anterior cortex (including the epithelium) that reduce significantly the accumulation of fluorophor. Such distribution studies are invaluable in clarifying metabolic interrelationships among the different zones of the lens, including especially photochemical reactions postulated to involve the effect of daylight on the lens in human subjects.\r"

These results confirm that Laue diffraction data sets, which can be obtained on a millisecond time scale, can be used to locate small molecules bound to protein active sites.

The drug-resistance phenotypes of both mutations segregated in genetic crosses with the presence of distinct, acidic variant beta-tubulin isoforms found assembled into the microtubules of the flagella. Analysis of the in vitro translation products of total poly(A)+ RNA from the mutants provided evidence that the variant proteins are altered primary beta-tubulin gene products. Compared to wild type, strains carrying the mutations expressed an increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of colchicine in clonal growth, flagellar assembly, and germination of meiotic products, suggesting that the beta-tubulin altered in the mutants participates in multiple microtubule functions.\r"

This effect was dose-dependent with a threshold of 20 micrograms/ml in chemically defined culture medium. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that the relative proportion of the G2/M population increased 2.5-fold after treatment of the cells with E-64 (100 micrograms/ml) for 5 hr. In addition, time-lapse video analysis showed that E-64-treated cells remained at metaphase for an extended period after rounding-up, whereas untreated cells completed mitosis within 42.0 +/- 5.7 min. Some treated cells were able to complete mitosis, while others did not do so within the limits of our observation.

One subset consists of three proteins (molecular mass from 80 to 87 kDa) secreted by replicating cells in sparse cultures, as well as by quiescent cells in confluent or serum-starved cultures of young fibroblasts. These proteins disappear from the medium when cultures reach the state of senescence. The other subset consists of a single protein of 57 kDa, detected only in conditioned medium of senescent fibroblast cultures. The results suggest that when human fibroblasts reach senescence, they secrete the 57-kDa protein and concomitantly stop secreting the other three proteins normally found in the culture medium of young fibroblasts. Therefore, the alternative secretion of these protein subsets could specifically signify irreversible arrest of cell growth during in vitro cellular aging.\r"

We have developed an approach that greatly increases the resolution for mapping these sites by electrophoresing genomic DNA on native polyacrylamide gels prior to electroblotting and hybridization. This improved method has been used to scan the promoter and coding region of a cell-cycle-dependent human histone H4 gene with an accuracy of +/-5-10 base pairs. Protein-DNA interactions can be seen in the autoradiograph as light areas and DNase I-hypersensitive sites as dark bands. Therefore, this method provides a rapid and relatively simple means to accurately localize protein-DNA interactions as well as DNase I-hypersensitive sites, thus directly displaying DNase I hypersensitivity and protein-DNA complexes on one autoradiograph. It also potentially allows the analysis of small changes in DNase I-hypersensitive sites under various biological conditions. With this technique rather large regions of DNA can be screened to determine areas that should be analyzed by more sophisticated methods, such as genomic sequencing or gel retardation assays.\r"

Although the study of natural variation, including t haplotypes, has yielded some information about the function of these genes, spontaneous variants often exhibit manifold genetic effects and are generally not carried on inbred backgrounds. To clearly connect phenotypes with the actions of individual genes, mutants in which genes are altered singly are needed. Therefore, we used a highly efficient point mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, in combination with classical breeding schemes to induce and identify recessive lethal mutations in the t region. Of 350 mutagenized gametes examined, at least 10 independent recessive embryonic lethal mutations have been identified; an additional two are perinatal lethals. A spontaneous brachyury mutation, TWis, arose on a genetic background that permits high-resolution mapping of the induced recessive mutations against cloned DNA sequences from the t region. One lethal mutation is an allele at the quaking locus. The multiple alleles of quaking and the feasibility of high-resolution mapping permit investigation of the pleiotropic action of this locus in mammalian development.\r"

Recent studies using Southern blotting analysis permit the partitioning of ionizing radiation-induced mutagenesis in mammalian cells into detectable deletions and major genomic rearrangements and into point mutations. The molecular nature of these point mutations has been left unresolved; they may include base substitutions as well as small deletions, insertions, and frame-shifts below the level of resolution of Southern blotting analysis. In this investigation, we have characterized a collection of ionizing radiation-induced point mutations at the endogenous adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) locus of Chinese hamster ovary cells at the DNA sequence level. Base substitutions represented approximately equal to 2/3 of the point mutations analyzed. Although the collection of mutants is relatively small, every possible type of base substitution event has been recovered. These mutations are well distributed throughout the coding sequence with only one multiple occurrence. Small deletions represented the remainder of characterized mutants; no insertions have been observed. Sequence-directed mechanisms mediated by direct repeats could account for some of the observed deletions, while others appear to be directly attributable to radiation-induced strand breakage.\r"

The dv mutation was generated by the spontaneous integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia virus into noncoding sequences of the dilute locus. Reversion of the dv mutation occurs by provirus excision and is mediated by homologous recombination events involving the viral long terminal repeat sequences. Although numerous independent germ-line d+ revertants have been identified, somatic d+ revertants have not been reported previously. During the past 5 years, we have screened more than one million mice homozygous for the dv mutation to determine whether we could identify somatic d+ revertants. This survey has resulted in the identification of a somatic d+ revertant and has provided a data base from which we can estimate the relative somatic and germ-line excision frequencies of retroviruses in mice and speculate about the nature of homologous recombination events producing d+ revertant alleles.\r"

In the case of HLA-DR, three DR beta-chain loci have been identified and linked, two of which (DR beta I and DR beta III, now assigned names HLA-DRIB and HLA-DR3B) are functional. We have shown that the HLA micropolymorphism detected at the DNA sequence level can easily be analyzed by hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides (HLA \"oligotyping\"). In the case of the HLA DRw52 supertypic specificity, which includes the DR3, DR5, DRw6, and DRw8 haplotypes, three alleles, referred to as DRw52a, DRw52b, and DRw52c, have recently been identified at the HLA-DR3B locus by DNA sequencing. Hybridization with locus- and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (designated 52a, 52b, and 52c) has been performed on DNA from normal individuals forming a panel of 82 haplotypes to establish the distribution of these three alleles. Individuals of the DR3 haplotype had either the DRw52a or DRw52b allele, and individuals of extended haplotype HLA-A1,B8,DR3 had only the DRw52a allele. DR5 individuals all had the DRw52b allele, while individuals of DRw6 haplotype had the DRw52a, -52b, or -52c allele. None of these three alelles are found in DRw8 individuals. Analysis of this micropolymorphism, undetectable by common typing procedures, is therefore now operational for more accurate HLA matching for transplantation and for improving correlations between HLA and disease susceptibility.\r"

In this report, a system of human fibroblasts transformed by an avian retrovirus has been employed to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon. Rous sarcoma virus has been used to transform in vitro human dermal fibroblasts, and clonal cell lines have been established from these cultures. In all the clones studied the integration of the provirus induced a reduction of cell-surface HLA-A, -B, -C framework antigen and beta 2-microglobulin expression when compared to levels for the respective parental fibroblasts. The reduction was correlated with a diminished intracellular synthesis of these molecules. Uninfected cells derived from an osteogenic sarcoma exhibited a reduced expression comparable to that of dermal diploid fibroblasts obtained from the same donor and transformed by Rous sarcoma virus. RNA gel blot analysis of total cellular RNA and of poly(A)+ cytoplasmic RNA showed a markedly decreased amount of HLA class I transcripts in the transformed cells. Southern blot study of genomic DNAs digested with several restriction endonucleases showed that the banding patterns of the HLA genes were not altered in the cells harboring the Rous sarcoma provirus. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Rous sarcoma provirus that does not seem to be linked to the major histocompatibility complex class I gene superfamily may negatively control HLA gene expression.\r"

However, IgG Kansas prevented the subsequent Ca2+-mediated activation of [a'b] to a + b, where a denotes the catalytically competent factor XIIIa species. IgG Kansas, in contrast to a previously studied autoimmune antibody from a similar bleeding disorder (IgG Warsaw), could also inhibit the transamidating activity of the preactivated a enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The pleiotropic effect of the sickle gene suggests that factors in addition to polymerization of the mutant gene product might be involved in sickle disease pathobiology. We have examined rates of heme transfer to hemopexin from hemoglobin in dilute aqueous solution (0.5 mg of Hb per ml) at 37 degrees C. HbO2 S loses heme 1.7 times faster than HbO2 A, with apparent rate constants of 0.024 hr-1 and 0.014 hr-1, respectively. In contrast, Hb A and Hb S behave identically in their MetHb forms (very rapid heme loss) and their HbCO forms (zero heme loss). This indicates that the faster heme loss from HbO2 S is due to accelerated autoxidation (HbO2----MetHb) rather than to some other type of instability inherent in the relationship of sickle heme to its pocket in globin. This interpretation is supported by spectrophotometric measurement of initial rates of MetHb formation during incubation at 37 degrees C. This directly shows 1.7 times faster autoxidation, with apparent rate constants of 0.050 hr-1 for HbO2 S and 0.029 hr-1 for HbO2 A. While the participation of this process in the cellular pathobiology of sickle erythrocytes remains unproven, the present data are consistent with, and perhaps help explain, two prior observations: the excessive spontaneous generation of superoxide by sickle erythrocytes; and the abnormal deposition of heme and heme proteins on membranes of sickle erythrocytes.\r"

The half-times (t1/2) for clearance of 111In and excess phospholipid from plasma were 20.8 +/- 0.9 hr and 20.3 +/- 4.6 hr in WHHL and 20.0 +/- 0.8 hr and 19.6 +/- 2.2 hr in the normal rabbits (means +/- SEM; n = 4). By 6 hr postinfusion, the plasma concentration of unesterified cholesterol increased by 2.2 +/- 0.23 mmol/liter in WHHL and 2.1 +/- 0.04 mmol/liter in normal rabbits, presumably reflecting mobilization of tissue stores. Disappearance of excess plasma cholesterol was greater than 90% complete in both groups of rabbits by 70 hr postinfusion. By quantitative gamma camera imaging, hepatic trapping of 111In-labeled liposomes over time was indistinguishable between the two groups. At autopsy, the liver was the major organ of clearance, acquiring 22.0% +/- 1.7% (WHHL) and 16.8% +/- 1.0% (normal of total 111In. Aortic uptake of 111In was less than 0.02%. Thus, mobilization of cholesterol and hepatic uptake of phospholipid liposomes do not require LDL receptors. Because phospholipid infusions produce rapid substantial regression of atherosclerosis in genetically normal animals, our results suggest that phospholipid liposomes or triglyceride phospholipid emulsions (e.g., Intralipid) might reduce atherosclerosis in WHHL rabbits and in humans with familial hypercholesterolemia.\r"

In all animals, the immunohistochemical reactivity of the retina for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was much higher in the closed than in the open eyes. The neuropeptide was localized to the perikaryon and dendrites of amacrine cells. No difference was observed in substance P immunoreactivity between open and closed eyes, suggesting that the observed effect is selective. The change in VIP immunoreactivity could be the result of an increase in peptide synthesis, a decrease in peptide release, or a combination of the two. These results indicate that VIP may play a part in the regulation of postnatal ocular growth.\r"

Recently, much attention has been paid to the discovery of an odorant-stimulated adenylate cyclase in purified olfactory cilia. This finding has, for the most part, been accepted as evidence that the former hypotheses are correct. Here we report that frog melanophores, which are nonolfactory in nature, disperse their melanosomes in response to the same types and concentrations of odorants used in the investigations of olfactory cilia and that pigment dispersion is accompanied by rises in intracellular cAMP levels. The effects show that the existence of a cAMP-based second messenger system in olfactory cilia is not in itself proof of the existence of olfactory-specific olfactory receptor proteins. Also they explain the basis of Ottoson's pioneering work of 30 years ago on the electrical responses of frog olfactory epithelium to stimulation with alcohols. The results suggest that there could be two mechanisms that are important for the detection of odorants: one based on specific receptors, the other nonspecific, but both working through activation of cAMP.\r"

IGF-I mRNA is 8-10 times more abundant in the cervical-thoracic spinal cord and in the olfactory bulb than in whole brain and is enriched 3-fold in the midbrain and cerebellum. IGF-II mRNA is minimally enriched in the medulla-pons and cerebellum but is 3-5 times less abundant in the midbrain and corpus striatum than in total brain. During CNS development the content of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs is highest at embryonic day 14 and declines by a factor of 3-4 at birth, to values found in adult brain. Embryonic neurons and glia synthesize IGF-I mRNA during short-term cell culture; only glia produce IGF-II mRNA. These observations show that IGF-I and IGF-II are differentially expressed in the developing and adult CNS and suggest that each growth factor may play a unique role in the mammalian nervous system.\r"

The predominant form of the NGF receptor on Schwann cells exists as an approximately equal to 80-kDa band, as determined by NaDodSO4/PAGE. We demonstrate that cultured Schwann cells shed a truncated (50-kDa) form of the NGF receptor (NGF-Rt) into their medium. Other cell types that shed the NGF-Rt into medium include a rat schwannoma and, to a lesser extent, PC12 cells and superior cervical ganglion neurons. NGF-Rt was not found in media conditioned by mixed neuron/glia cultures from various brain regions, or anterior pituitary cells derived from rat. In vivo, NGF-Rt was present in neonatal rat urine, and its presence was developmentally regulated: levels were high in postnatal day-1 rat urine and declined to low, but detectable, levels by weeks 4 and 8. NGF-Rt was also found in amniotic fluid and in the stomach contents of fetal rats. Maternal urine (pre- and postnatal) had slightly elevated NGF-Rt levels over normal adult urine. NGF-Rt was detected in rat plasma and showed developmental regulation similar to that found for urine. In addition, a 77-kDa receptor species was detected in plasma during early development. Finally, NGF-Rt was significantly elevated in the urine of adult rats with bilateral sciatic nerve lesions. These findings suggest that the developmentally regulated release of NGF-Rt, present in plasma and other body fluids, plays a regulatory role in nervous system development.\r"

A population of 10-20% of the photoreceptors exhibited a mixed-response waveform of the rod and the cone under dark-adapted conditions, and a response waveform closely resembled that of a cone in the presence of background illumination. Lucifer yellow injection revealed that these cells are morphologically identical to rods, and thus they are named rodcs. Dark-adapted rodcs exhibited a rod-like spectral sensitivity with a peak at approximately 520 nm that shifted to a cone-like spectral sensitivity with a peak at approximately 620 nm in response to background light (Purkinje shift). The voltage response of a rodc to a -1-nA current step injected into an adjacent cone is approximately 3.6 times larger than that of a rod to the same current step. These results indicate that there is a population of rods (rodcs) in the tiger salamander retina that is strongly coupled to the cones and that these cells allow significant mixture of rod and cone signals at the photoreceptor level.\r"

The results of studies using the patch-clamp technique in the cell-attached mode indicate that, 0.5-3 min after the addition of glycine to the bathing solution, there is a marked increase in the activity of single channels, which is almost all instances were previously present and operant in the plasma membrane. Successfully excised patches of membrane that contained a channel stimulated by glycine fell into two categories. Some became inactive within 15 sec in spite of the fact that the G omega seal remained intact. Others persisted for the lifetime of the seal. All of the persistent channels had an 11-fold selectivity for Cl- over K+ and a conductance of 23 pS when bathed by symmetrical 150 mM KCl solutions. Although the ionic specificities of the other channels have not been identified, there is reason to suspect that they might be K+ channels whose activities are dependent on factors lost when the patch is excised. Swelling induced by exposing these cells to a 50% hypotonic perfusate stimulated the activities of Cl- channels whose properties closely resemble those stimulated by the addition of glycine to the perfusate, strongly suggesting that the glycine-induced stimulation of Cl- channel activity is part of a volume-regulatory response to cell swelling. If the increase in channel activity induced by the addition of glycine to the perfusate is indeed a response to cell swelling, then this perfusate is indeed a response to cell swelling, then this volume-regulatory response must be extremely sensitive inasmuch as it appears to be \"triggered\" by an average increase in cell volume that does not exceed 5%.\r"

A cDNA library was constructed from size-enriched gastric poly(A)+ RNA and screened for IF-positive clones by antibody and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probe hybridization. An IF clone was isolated and sequenced, revealing a predicted primary amino acid sequence in the coding region of 421 amino acids and a putative signal sequence of 22 amino acids. The primary translation product of IF produced in a cell-free translation system displayed cobalamin (Cbl)-binding activity without proteolytic processing or glycosylation. The amino-terminal region of IF showed significant secondary structural and hydropathic homologies with the nucleotide-binding domain in NAD-dependent oxidoreductases. Alignment of the first 80 residues of IF, following the signal peptide, demonstrated homology with the nucleotide-binding domain of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase. Based on these data, we propose a model of IF tertiary structure in which the Cbl-binding domain resides in the NH2-terminal half of the protein.\r"

Complete inhibition of the GEF-catalyzed exchange of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-bound GDP for GTP was observed in the presence of either 0.5-0.75 mM NAD+ or NADP+. Incubation of GEF with ATP results in the phosphorylation of its Mr 82,000 polypeptide. This phosphorylation is strongly inhibited by heparin but is not affected by heme or H8 (N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C. The purification of GEF was modified to eliminate any contaminating kinase activity and the isolated protein appears to be homogeneous as judged by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The Mr 82,000 subunit of GEF is phosphorylated only upon addition of ATP and casein kinase II. The extent of phosphorylation is approximately equal to 0.55 mol of phosphate per mol of GEF, and this results in a 2.3-fold increase in the guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Following treatment of the phosphorylated GEF with alkaline phosphatase, the activity of the protein is reduced by a factor of 5. Rephosphorylation of GEF increases its specific activity to that of the phosphorylated protein. The results of this study suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of GEF plays a role in regulating polypeptide chain initiation.\r"

We have previously shown that the human PBGD is encoded by a single gene and have now cloned and characterized this gene, which is split into 15 exons spread over 10 kilobases of DNA. We demonstrate that the two mRNAs arise from two overlapping transcription units. The first one (upstream) is active in all tissues and its promoter has some of the structural features of a housekeeping promoter; the second, located 3 kilobases downstream, is active only in erythroid cells and its promoter displays structural homologies with the beta-globin gene promoters.\r"

We have studied the interaction between T antigen and these sites by two methods--nitrocellulose filter binding and DNase I protection. We show that T antigen binds with high occupancy to site I at 0 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C but to site II only at 0 degrees C and 25 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the temperature essential for the initiation of SV40 DNA replication in vitro, ATP is required for the interaction of T antigen and site II. ATP can be replaced efficiently by adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate and ADP, suggesting that hydrolysis of the nucleotide is not essential for the binding of T antigen to site II. The binding to the region critical for replication can occur in the presence of a variety of nucleoside triphosphates; dATP supports binding at a concentration 1/30th that of ATP, while dGTP and rGTP were inactive at all concentrations tested.\r"

The appearance of the ERn doublet is hormonally inducible, and the relative proportions of the two doublet bands are influenced by the type of hormone treatment, with weakly estrogenic compounds yielding the lower band as predominant while potent estrogens increase the proportion of the upper band. Steroid binding of the ERn doublet was determined by [3H]tamoxifen aziridine affinity labeling of both the 66.4- and the 65-kDa peptides; binding to the 65-kDa peptide was predominant.

Inositol cyclic phosphates did not react with neutral methanol in the absence of the cells, which are required for the methanolysis reaction.

The probability Po of the channel being open strongly depended on the cGMP concentration (EC50 = 31 microM; Hill coefficient, n = 2.3); whereas the single-channel conductance (lambda = 26 pS) was independent of the agonist concentration. The agonist-stimulated increase in the probability of an open channel was largely due to shorter closed times and, to a lesser extent, due to the channel staying open for a longer time. The current-voltage relationship of the single open channel deviated from ohmic behavior, and the open probability decreased at more negative membrane potentials. The rectification of the macroscopic cGMP-induced current in artificial bilayers that contained many channel copies can be accounted for by the voltage dependence of channel gating together with the nonlinearity of the current-voltage curve of an open channel. Current fluctuations exhibited a variety of sublevels, indicating that the channel may exist in more than one conductive state.\r"

During the course of developing a mass spectrometric assay for 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, several compounds with characteristics similar to PGF2 were detected in both plasma and urine of normal humans by selected ion monitoring. Analysis of pooled plasma obtained from patients with mastocytosis during severe episodes of systemic mast cell activation associated with the release of markedly increased quantities of PGD2 was revealing in that all of these compounds were present in approximately 800-fold greater abundance compared to levels found in normal plasma, suggesting that these compounds arose from PGD2 metabolism. Complete electron impact mass spectra were obtained of these compounds in both plasma and urine; these spectra established that they were all isometric forms of PGF2. Approximately 16 isomeric PGF2 compounds were identified. Treatment with butylboronic acid indicated that the C-9 and C-11 hydroxyls were trans in approximately one-third of the compounds and cis in approximately two-thirds. Preliminary experiments suggest that PGD2 is a very labile compound in vivo and undergoes extensive isomerization, after which reduction by 11-ketoreductase yields a family of more stable isomeric PGF2 compounds. Elucidating the profile of biological activity of these compounds and their mechanism of formation will contribute importantly to our understanding of the biological consequences of PGD2 release in vivo. These results also bring into question the reliability of assays for PGF2 alpha and its metabolites in human biological fluids as a specific index of endogenous PGF2 alpha biosynthesis, as these assays may also measure in part isomeric PGF2 compounds arising from PGD2 metabolism.\r"

The primary structure was determined by automated sequence analysis of peptides produced by limited acid hydrolysis and by trypsin digestion. The comparative antigenicity of chicken MT was determined by radioimmunoassay using rabbit anti-rat MT polyclonal antibody. Chicken MT consists of 63 amino acids as compared to 61 found in MTs from mammals. One insertion (and two substitutions) occurs in the amino-terminal region, a region considered invariant among mammalian MTs. Eighteen of the 20 cysteines in chicken MT were aligned with cysteines from other mammalian sequences. Two cysteines near the carboxyl terminus are shifted by one residue due to the insertion of proline in that region. Overall, the chicken protein showed approximately equal to 68% sequence identity in a comparison with various mammalian MTs. The affinity of the polyclonal antibody for chicken MT was decreased by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to that of a mammalian MT (rat MT isoforms). This reduced affinity is attributed to major substitutions in chicken MT in the regions of the principal determinants of mammalian MTs. Theoretical analysis of the primary structure predicted the secondary structure to consist of reverse turns and random coils with no stable beta or helix conformations. There is no evidence that chicken MT differs functionally from mammalian MTs.\r"

To study the structure, function, and expression of ALP, a full-length cDNA of rat ALP (2415 bases) was isolated from a ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cell lambda gt10 cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence spans 524 residues and includes an N-terminal signal peptide of 17 amino acids, the phosphohydrolase active site, a rather hydrophilic backbone with five potential N-glycosylation sites, and a short hydrophobic C-terminal sequence. ALP negative CHO cells transfected with an expression vector containing the ALP coding sequences express ALP. The rat bone, liver, and kidney ALP shows remarkable 90% homology with the corresponding human enzyme, the most divergent region being the C-terminal hydrophobic domain through which the enzyme may be anchored to the plasma membrane. The rat ALP also shows 50% homology with the human placental and intestinal ALP and 25% homology with the Escherichia coli ALP. The amino acids involved in catalysis show nearly complete homology among all known ALP sequences, suggesting that these enzymes evolved from a common ancestral gene. The rat ALP cDNA pRAP 54, used as a hybridization probe in RNA blot analysis of several tissues that express ALP, revealed the presence of an ALP mRNA of approximately equal to 2500 bases. Furthermore, hybridization patterns derived from Southern blot analysis of rat chromosomal DNA offered molecular evidence that the ALP expressed in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma and various rat tissues, excluding the intestine, is the product of the same single copy gene.\r"

However, the molecular mechanism by which retinoids exert these effects is unknown. Cultured murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, which differentiate into nontumorigenic endoderm cells in response to retinoic acid (RA), have been used to identify genes regulated by RA. A cDNA library synthesized from F9 cells treated with RA for 8 hr has been screened with a cDNA probe enriched for sequences rapidly induced by RA, and a gene that exhibits the characteristics of a primary target for RA has been identified. This gene, early retinoic acid-1 (Era-1), encodes a 2.2- to 2.4-kilobase polyadenylylated RNA; the level of Era-1 mRNA rapidly and transiently increases up to 35-fold, depending on the concentration of exogenous RA. The increase in Era-1 mRNA is dependent on the continuous presence of exogenous RA. The RA-associated increase in Era-1 mRNA is seen even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, but the increase is prevented by inhibitors of RNA synthesis such as actinomycin D. This increase in the steady-state level of Era-1 mRNA in F9 cells is a very early effect of retinoic acid on gene expression in this differentiation system.\r"

The vector is a shuttle vector that replicates to high copy numbers in both Escherichia coli and eukaryotic cells permissive for SV40 replication. Transfection of the HIV DNA-containing vector (pSVSX1) into the CV-1 monkey cell line gave high levels of expression of the envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp120 in 20-30% of the transfected cells. By several criteria, the proteins were indistinguishable from those produced during infection. The proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and some of the gp120 was shed into the culture medium. Approximately 0.5 microgram of envelope protein could be extracted from 10(6) cells. This is at least 100 times higher than the levels found in HIV-infected H9 cells. In addition, a trans-activation assay performed with pSVSX1 and a plasmid containing the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase under the control of the HIV long terminal repeat demonstrated that a functional tat gene product also was expressed. Thus, this transient vector system provides an abundant source of native envelope protein for purification and characterization and also will be useful for studies dealing with the regulation of HIV gene expression.\r"

Although these mutations have little effect on the efficiency of viral DNA replication, they decrease the yield of infectious virus particles by 3-4 orders of magnitude [Pipas, J. (1985) J. Virol. 54, 569-575]. Here we show that the level of late RNA is lower by a factor of 5-15 in CV-1P monkey cells infected with these mutants compared to cells infected with wild-type SV40. Consistent with this decrease in RNA, synthesis of late viral structural proteins VP1 and VP3 decreases by a factor of 5-15. In contrast, the synthesis of SV40 agnoprotein decreases by a factor greater than 100. Intercistronic complementation of these mutants with pm1493 and dl121, two SV40 mutants that are defective in agnoprotein but encode wild-type T antigen, results in an increased synthesis of agnoprotein in the infected cells. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of T antigen participates in the posttranscriptional regulation of agnoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that a significant correlation is seen when the hydropathy scores of amino acids encoded by the coding strand of double-helical DNA are plotted against those of the noncoding strand. Thus, peptides encoded by complementary DNA strands might form amphiphilic structures and bind one another. We have used this approach to study the interaction between fibronectin (FN) and its cell receptor. Taking into consideration the nucleotide sequence from published rat cDNA clones that corresponds to the cell binding site (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) in the FN molecule, the deduced amino acid sequence found for the putative receptor binding site was Trp-Thr-Val-Pro-Thr-Ala. This peptide was chemically synthesized and coupled to an AH-Sepharose column. FN bound appreciably to this column and was eluted much more efficiently by a solution of Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-containing peptide than by a solution of related but inactive Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-containing peptide. Binding of labeled FN to receptor-rich MG63 human osteosarcoma cells was inhibited by the hexapeptide. The hexapeptide Gly-Ala-Val-Ser-Thr-Ala predicted similarly from the nucleotide sequence of human FN was equally efficient in such inhibition. Antibodies produced against Trp-Thr-Val-Pro-Thr-Ala recognized with equal efficiency Gly-Ala-Val-Ser-Thr-Ala in an ELISA assay. Furthermore, they were able to recognize a single 140-kDa band in whole-cell extracts from Chinese hamster ovary cells, attesting to their specificity. Identification of the recognized protein was provided by showing that this antibody was also able to bind to affinity-purified FN receptor from human osteosarcoma MG63 cells.\r"

RNA gel blot hybridization analysis and primer extension sequencing of cDNA to rps12 encoding RNAs indicate that exon 1 and exons 2 and 3 are encoded on separate transcripts. Exon 1 and exons 2 and 3 are covalently ligated in the correct reading frame in rps12 mRNA. These results indicate that a bimolecular (trans-) splicing event occurs during the formation of mature rps12 mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of the set of early adenovirus genes is subject to positive control by the viral E1A gene. For one early viral gene, the E2 gene, this induction involves an increase in a cellular promoter-specific factor termed E2F. We have analyzed the kinetics for this induction and find that E2F is present at only very low levels in extracts of uninfected cells or cells infected for up to 3 hr with adenovirus type 5. The factor increases rapidly at 5 hr and reaches a maximal level at 7-8 hr. The kinetics of induction of the factor are thus coincident with the induction of E2 transcription. The 13S E1A gene product (289-amino acid protein), which is required for the efficient activation of E2 transcription in a productive infection, is also responsible for the activation of E2F, because infection with mutant strain pm975 (13S+, 12S-) induces the factor, whereas no increase of E2F occurs in cells infected by mutant strain dl1500 (13S-, 12S+). Finally, increase in the factor does not involve synthesis of any new protein, because extracts prepared from cells infected with adenovirus type 5 and treated with cycloheximide from 1 hr after infection contain approximately the same level of E2F as extracts from infected but untreated cells. From these results, we conclude that activation of E2F, as a posttranslational event, is responsible for the stimulation of E2 transcription by E1A.\r"

Leukotrienes are potent arachidonic acid metabolites possessing biological activities that suggest a role in the pathophysiology of allergic and inflammatory diseases. To obtain structural information about 5-LO for use in developing anti-inflammatory chemotherapeutic agents, the enzyme was purified from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the amino acid sequences were determined for several cyanogen bromide-derived peptides. A cDNA clone encoding a 674-amino acid protein containing all of the derived peptide sequences was isolated from a dimethyl sulfoxide differentiated HL60 cell cDNA library. The mRNA encoding 5-LO was detected only in differentiated HL60 cells and not in the undifferentiated cell line, indicating that the expression of 5-LO in this cell line is transcriptionally regulated. In addition, the human protein displays some amino acid sequence homology with several lipases and significant homology with the partial sequences of soybean and reticulocyte lipoxygenases. Thus, 5-LO appears to be a member of a larger family of related enzymes.\r"

The 72 prominent capsomere units that comprise the T = 7d icosahedral surface lattice of the capsid are clearly resolved. Both the pentavalent and hexavalent capsomeres appear with pentameric substructure, indicating that bonding specificity in the shell is not quasi-equivalent. There is a remarkable similarity between the structure of the SV40 virion capsid and the structure reported for the polyoma empty capsid. This result establishes that (i) the unexpected pentameric substructure of the hexavalent capsomeres is also present in virions and (ii) the arrangement of the 72 pentamers in the capsid lattice may be a characteristic feature of the entire papova family of viruses. The center of the SV40 reconstruction reveals electron density corresponding to the nucleohistone core. This density is smeared, suggesting that the minichromosome is not organized with icosahedral symmetry matching the capsid symmetry. The visualization of the virion chromatin provides a basis for invoking new models for the higher order structure of the encapsidated minichromosome.\r"

  ".W": "Stomatal opening in response to light has a component that matches the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll; however, the intervening sensory transduction steps are not well understood. To study this process, we illuminated Vicia faba guard cell protoplasts with red light and simultaneously recorded current flow across the plasma membrane, utilizing the patch clamp technique in the whole cell configuration. We report evidence that under voltage clamp conditions, red light (1 mmol of photons.m-2.S-1) stimulated an outward current. This response required ATP (2.5 mM) and orthophosphate (1 mM) at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Both red-light-stimulated currents and currents activated in the dark by the proton pump agonist fusicoccin (10 microM) were abolished by the protonophore carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone at 10 microM, indicating that these responses were carried by protons. Pump currents were inhibited by orthovanadate applied to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (50% inhibition at 3.5 microM), implicating a H+ -ATPase. Elimination of the current by the photosynthetic inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP, pointed to a requirement for photosynthetically active chloroplasts. We conclude that red light stimulates an electrogenic proton pump at the plasmalemma of Vicia guard cells and that chloroplasts modulate this response.\r"

  ".W": "The ryanodine receptor of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from fast-twitch skeletal muscle has been purified and found by electron microscopy to be equivalent to the feet structures that are involved in situ in the junctional association of transverse tubules with terminal cisternae of SR. We now find that when the purified receptor is incorporated into vesicle-derived planar bilayers, it forms Ca2+-specific channels, which are dependent on submicromolar Ca2+ for activity. In the presence of 1 mM ATP, the channel shows essentially no activity at 10 nM Ca2+ but becomes highly activated at 50 nM Ca2+. At suboptimal Ca2+ levels (100 nM), the channel is strongly activated by 1 mM ATP and can be blocked by ruthenium red, both effects being prevented by higher Ca2+ levels (1 microM). Mg2+, added from the cis side at millimolar concentrations, blocks Ca2+ flux through the channel from trans to cis (equivalent to flux from luminal to myoplasmic compartment). Ryanodine stabilizes the open state of the channel and blocks the action of ruthenium red to close the channel. Thus, the purified ryanodine receptor incorporated into a bilayer has the Ca2+-channel characteristics consistent with the calcium release observed in isolated terminal cisternae vesicles. Furthermore, ryanodine induced the appearance of a sublevel gating mode characterized by long open conductance states, which were integral multiples of the smallest observed conductance, 3.8 pS in 50 mM Ca2+. The purified receptor consists essentially of a single-sized high molecular weight polypeptide (Mr. approximately equal to 360,000), which on reconstitution forms the square rectangles diagnostic of the feet structures. We conclude that the identity of the Ca2+-release channel of SR is the foot structure, which consists of an oligomer of the high molecular weight polypeptide.\r"

USA 81, 6728-6732]. In the model, a microtubule exists either in a slowly growing phase (first-order rate constant, alpha) characterized by the existence of a GTP-tubulin cap at the growing tip; or the same microtubule exists in a rapidly shrinking phase (first-order rate constant, beta), which is entered if/when the GTP-tubulin cap is lost through a fluctuation, thus exposing GDP-tubulin subunits, which constitute the body of the microtubule. Transition between the two phases--i.e., loss of a cap (first-order rate constant, k) or formation of a new cap (first-order rate constant, k') occurs very infrequently and in a stochastic manner. In vitro experiments with centrosome-nucleated microtubules by Mitchison and Kirschner and Monte Carlo kinetic simulations, based on a realistic set of microscopic rate constants that apply to the end of a microtubule, suggest this alternation between two \"quasimacroscopic\" phases. In this paper, I outline the calculation of the mean lifetime of a microtubule nucleated on a centrosome by using Hill's model. For a microtubule M units long in the slowly growing phase, the mean lifetime for complete depolymerization is [M(k + k') + alpha + beta](beta k - alpha k')-1, provided that beta k greater than alpha k'. If the microtubule is in the rapidly shrinking phase, then the mean lifetime is M(k + k')(beta k - alpha k')-1, provided that beta k greater than alpha k'. In case beta k less than alpha k', the microtubule grows indefinitely, and the mean lifetime is infinite.\r"

Protein bands that stained brown, yellow, and blue were excised from stained gels and prepared for electron microscopy by thin-sectioning. In each case, the size distributions of globular silver grains were determined directly from the electron micrographs. We found that blue bands have larger silver grains (with diameters of 40-100 nm) than yellow (21-39 nm) or brown bands (17-35 nm). On the basis of these and other observations, a general mechanism is proposed whereby chemical specificity of electrophoretically separated proteins is expressed in color-specific silver staining.\r"

  ".W": "We have used in situ hybridization to study the intracellular distribution of mRNAs for cell cycle-dependent core and H1 histone proteins in human WI-38 fibroblasts. Because histones are abundant nuclear proteins and histone mRNA expression is tightly coupled to DNA synthesis, it was of interest to determine whether histone mRNAs are localized near the nucleus. Cells were hybridized with tritiated DNA probes specific for either histone H1, histone H4, actin, or poly(A)+ mRNA and were processed for autoradiography. In exponentially growing cultures, the fraction of histone mRNA-positive cells correlated well with the fraction of cells in S phase and was eliminated by hydroxyurea inhibition of DNA synthesis. Within individual cells the label for histone mRNA was widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and did not appear to be more heavily concentrated near the nucleus. However, histone mRNA appeared to exhibit patchy, nonhomogeneous localization, and a quantitative evaluation confirmed that grain distributions were not as uniform as they were after hybridizations to poly(A)+ mRNA. Actin mRNA in WI-38 cells was also widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm but differed from histone mRNA in that label for actin mRNA was frequently most dense at the outermost region of narrow cell extensions. The localization of actin mRNA was less pronounced but qualitatively very similar to that previously described for chicken embryonic myoblasts and fibroblasts. We conclude that localization of histones in WI-38 cells is not facilitated by localization of histone protein synthesis near the nucleus and that there are subtle but discrete and potentially functional differences in the distributions of histone, actin, and poly(A)+ mRNAs.\r"

The cells were then treated with MNU on day 3 of culture and subsequently at weekly intervals for up to 4 weeks. Eleven to 14 days after the final carcinogen treatment, the cells were removed from the collagen gels and injected into the cleared mammary fat pads of syngeneic hosts to assay for transformed cell populations. A single exposure or multiple exposures of these cells to MNU was effective in inducing tumorigenic cells that produced palpable tumors as early as 6 weeks after transplantation. Two treatments with MNU (100 micrograms/ml) were optimal for neoplastic transformation and produced tumors in 79% of the injected fat pads. All the tumors originated at the site of injection and had extensive central necroses. Histological examination indicated that the tumors were mammary carcinomas. Secondary transplantation of tumor pieces into intact mammary glands produced palpable carcinomas of the same histology within 1-8 weeks. Control cells cultured for the same periods of time as MNU-treated cells produced only ductal outgrowths that were morphologically similar to those found in the mammary glands of adult virgin hosts. This system provides a distinct means to study the mechanism of mammary neoplastic transformation at cellular and molecular levels.\r"

In the present study, we report an alteration of band 3 molecule that is associated with the following changes: erythrocyte shape change from discoid to \"thorny cells\" (acanthocytes), restriction of rotational diffusion of band 3 in the membrane, increase in anion transport, and decrease in the number of high-affinity ankyrin-binding sites. Changes in erythrocyte IgG binding, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fluorescence polarization (indicative of membrane fluidity), and other membrane proteins as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were not detected. Cells containing the altered band 3 polypeptide were obtained from individuals with abnormal erythrocyte morphology. Two-dimensional peptide maps revealed differences in the Mr 17,000 anion transport segment of band 3 consistent with additions of tyrosines or tyrosine-containing peptides. The data suggest that (i) this alteration of band 3 does not result in accelerated aging as does cleavage and (ii) structural changes in the anion transport region result in alterations in anion transport.\r"

Working with data only up to 1933, they concluded that the number of resident land bird species had approached equilibrium by 1908-1919, 25-36 years after the eruption, when the number of vascular plant species was still increasing. Recent surveys of vertebrates on the archipelago show continuing colonization, as well as species turnover. Nonmigrant nonmarine birds and reptiles are only now approaching equilibrium species numbers; archipelago acquisition rates for these groups are lower than in the 40 years following the 1883 eruption. Apparent (minimal) annual extinction rates are an order of magnitude lower than those calculated for equilibrium by MacArthur and Wilson. The active volcano Anak Krakatau emerged in 1930 and suffered an eruption in 1952 that destroyed the vegetation. It is still at an early stage of succession and on the threshold of major vegetational change. This island and a physically dynamic, ever-young spit on Sertung I, also held at an early successional stage, may provide (i) ecological refuges for some species whose optimal habitat on the older islands is being extirpated by vegetational succession and (ii) ecological \"windows\" through which such species may still establish from the mainland, thus postponing their extinction on the archipelago.\r"

  ".W": "The cytochrome b gene of Trypanosoma brucei has an ATG codon near its 5' end but the cytochrome b genes of the related kinetoplastids Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata lack an ATG. Recent results have shown that 34 uridines that are not encoded in the genome are added within the 5' end of T. brucei cytochrome b transcripts during or after transcription. These additions create an AUG in the transcript that is 20 amino acids upstream of the AUG predicted from the genomic sequence. We report here that the cytochrome b transcripts of L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata also contain added uridines within their 5' ends. The additions occur in similar numbers and positions and an in frame AUG is created at a similar site in all three species. These data strongly suggest that the created AUG functions as the initiation codon for cytochrome b in these species. Since some other kinetoplastid mitochondrial genes also lack conventional initiation codons, creation of initiation codons may be an important function of uridine addition.\r"

A recent survey of leukocyte antigens using flow cytometry has shown that staining of certain Qa antigens was diminished after PtdIns-PLC treatment, but staining of structurally related H-2 antigens was not affected. Therefore, in this study, the sensitivity of cell-surface Qa-2, H-2Kb, and H-2Db to hydrolysis by PtdIns-PLC was investigated biochemically by immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated molecules from cell lysates or supernatants. Qa-2, but not H-2Kb, was released from the surface of PtdIns-PLC-treated C57BL/10 mouse spleen cells and recovered in the cell supernatants. Similar analysis of thymoma cells transfected with cloned C57BL/10 genes showed that cell-surface Qa-2 molecules encoded by a Q7b cDNA and the Q7b or Q9b gene were sensitive to hydrolysis by PtdIns-PLC, whereas the H-2Kb and H-2Db gene products were resistant. Using thymoma cells transfected with hybrid genes constructed by exchanging exons between Q7b and H-2Db, the signals for PtdIns modification were localized to a defined region of Qa-2. This region differs from H-2Db most significantly by the presence of a central aspartate residue in the transmembrane segment and in the length of the cytoplasmic portion.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms responsible for broad-based resistance to antitumor drugs derived from natural products (multidrug resistance) are incompletely understood. Agents known to reverse the multidrug-resistant phenotype (verapamil and trifluoperazine) can also inhibit the activity of protein kinase C. When we assayed human breast cancer cell lines for protein kinase C activity, we found that enzyme activity was 7-fold higher in the multidrug-resistant cancer cells compared with the control, sensitive parent cells. Exposure of drug-sensitive cells to the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate [P(BtO)2] led to an increase in protein kinase C activity and induced a drug-resistance phenotype, whereas exposure of drug-resistant cells to P(BtO)2 further increased drug resistance. In sensitive cells, this increased resistance was accompanied by a 3.5-fold increased phosphorylation of a 20-kDa particulate protein and a 35-40% decreased intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and vincristine. P(BtO)2 induced resistance to agents involved in the multidrug-resistant phenotype (doxorubicin and vincristine) but did not affect sensitivity to an unrelated alkylating agent (melphalan). The increased resistance was partially or fully reversible by the calcium channel blocker verapamil and by the calmodulin-antagonist trifluoperazine. These data suggest that stimulation of protein kinase C plays a role in the drug-transport changes in multidrug-resistant cells. This may occur through modulation of an efflux pump by protein phosphorylation.\r"

  ".W": "Keloids are benign dermal tumors that form during an abnormal wound-healing process in genetically susceptible individuals. Although growth of normal and keloid cells did not differ in medium containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, keloid cultures grew to significantly higher densities than normal cells in medium containing 5% (vol/vol) plasma or 1% fetal bovine serum. Conditioned medium from keloid cultures did not stimulate growth of normal cells in plasma nor did it contain detectable platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor. Keloid fibroblasts responded differently than normal adult fibroblasts to transforming growth factor beta. Whereas transforming growth factor beta reduced growth stimulation by epidermal growth factor in cells from normal adult skin or scars, it enhanced the activity of epidermal growth factor in cells from keloids. Normal and keloid fibroblasts also responded differently to hydrocortisone: growth was stimulated in normal adult cells and unaffected or inhibited in keloid cells. Fetal fibroblasts resembled keloid cells in their ability to grow in plasma and in their response to hydrocortisone. The ability of keloid fibroblasts to grow to higher cell densities in low-serum medium than cells from normal adult skin or from normal early or mature scars suggests that a reduced dependence on serum growth factors may account for their prolonged growth in vivo. Similarities between keloid and fetal cells suggest that keloids may result from the untimely expression of a growth-control mechanism that is developmentally regulated.\r"

  ".W": "A 34-amino acid peptide and three other structurally related peptides were isolated from rabbit fetal and adult lung. These cationic arginine- and cysteine-rich peptides inhibit corticotropin (ACTH)-stimulated rat adrenal cell corticosterone production. The peptide was called corticostatin (CSI). CSI was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and was shown to be homogenous from its amino acid analysis. Its sequence was determined on a gas-phase sequenator. The structure of CSI is Gly-Ile-Cys-Ala-Cys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Phe-Cys-Pro-Asn-Ser-Glu-Arg-Phe-Ser-Gly- Tyr-Cys - Arg-Val-Asn-Gly-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Val-Arg-Cys-Cys-Ser-Arg-Arg. CSI was found to markedly inhibit ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production by rat adrenal cells in vitro but did not affect basal levels. CSI did not affect the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis by angiotensin II in rat zona glomerulosa cells but it did suppress ACTH-stimulated aldosterone synthesis in whole adrenal cells, demonstrating that CSI is a specific inhibitor of ACTH-stimulated corticosteroid synthesis. The minimum effective concentration of CSI inhibiting ACTH-stimulated (33 pM) corticosterone production was 5 nM (20 ng/ml), the ED50 (50% effective dose) was 25 nM and steroidogenesis was completely inhibited at concentrations greater than 500 nM (2 micrograms/ml).\r"

Similarly, TNF alone had a low systemic toxicity in tumor- and pathogen-free mice. However, TNF given intravenously with nanogram quantities of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide caused lethal shock. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide made skin susceptible to subsequent induction of HN by TNF injected in the same site 24 hr later. Mycoplasma-infected cells or corynebacteria also synergized with TNF to cause HN or lethal shock. In addition, we find that lymphotoxin, a cytokine functionally and genetically related to TNF, also synergized with the bacteria to cause HN, whereas interleukin 1 alpha or interferon gamma did not. Together, the results indicate that a synergy between TNF and bacteria or their products causes HN and lethal shock in normal mice.\r"

  ".W": "A strong correlation was found between the basal levels of membrane-bound protein kinase C and the ability of B16 melanoma cell sublines (F10, F1, and BL6) to metastasize to the lung after intravenous injection. By treating with tumor-promoting phorbol esters for 1 hr, the low-metastasizing F1 cells exhibited both translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membrane and an increase in metastasis to a level comparable to the (untreated) highly metastatic subline F10. Prolonged treatment of melanoma sublines with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hr resulted in both inactivation of protein kinase C activity and loss of their metastasizing capabilities. Under conditions that induced only the activation of protein kinase C but not its membrane association, no increase in metastasis occurred, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C alone is insufficient to promote metastasis and that its membrane association is also necessary. Exposure of B16 melanoma sublines to phorbol esters for 1 hr had (i) no effect on the growth and morphology of these cells in vivo and in vitro and (ii) a short-term effect (approximately equal to 5 hr) on membrane association of protein kinase C. Nonetheless, in this period, the membrane-bound protein kinase C, probably by influencing cell-surface and cell-attachment properties, increased the retention of circulating melanoma cells in the lung, which eventually led to an increased number of metastatic nodules. The membrane-bound protein kinase C activity also correlated with metastatic ability in rapidly growing cells, growth-arrested cells, and cells growing in a low-Ca2+ medium. The results strongly suggest that the membrane-bound protein kinase C influences hematogenous metastasis of tumor cells and show that tumor promoters like phorbol esters have an additional role in promoting hematogenous spread of cancer in the body.\r"

  ".W": "Dynorphin, an opioid peptide, is thought to play an important role in the modulation of nociceptive neural circuits at the level of the spinal cord. In a model of peripheral inflammation and hyperalgesia, an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe complementary to a portion of preprodynorphin mRNA and antisera to dynorphin A-(1-8) were used to localize changes in dynorphin mRNA and peptide to individual spinal cord neurons. Intraplantar injection in rats of complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in edema and hyperalgesia to radiant heat stimulation of the injected hind paw that reached a peak at 4 days. At the same time, in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry identified an increase in transcription of preprodynorphin mRNA that was paralleled by an increase in dynorphin peptide. These changes were seen in spinal neurons in the medial two-thirds of laminae I and II and in laminae V and VI of lumbar segments receiving innervation from the inflamed paw. Since neurons demonstrating the increase in dynorphin biosynthesis are located in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn laminae, our data provide evidence for opioid modulation of nociceptive neural circuits in these two distinct spinal locations.\r"

We have used 125I-DPDYN to autoradiographically visualize supraspinal kappa-opioid receptor sites in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. The autoradiographic dispositions of 125I-DPDYN in sections from cerebellum are clearly different in guinea pig and rabbit, suggesting that kappa receptors have different functions in this organ of the two species. Autoradiograms from 125I-DPDYN-labeled brain sections also reveal major species differences, in particular in thalamus, which is densely labeled in rabbit and considerably less so in rat and guinea pig. The data show that 125I-DPDYN is a useful probe to visualize kappa-opioid receptor sites in nerve tissue sections directly and rapidly.\r"

WGA enters cells by adsorptive endocytosis after binding to specific cell surface oligosaccharides. Blood-borne WGA-HRP labeled the entire cerebrovascular tree from the luminal side 5 min after injection; pericytes, located on the abluminal surface of cerebral endothelia, sequestered the lectin conjugate 6 hr later. Endothelial organelles harboring WGA-HRP 3 hr after injection included the luminal plasmalemma, endocytic vesicles, endosomes (prelysosomes), secondary lysosomes, and the Golgi complex. The peroxidase reaction product labeled the abluminal surface of cerebral endothelia and occupied the perivascular clefts by 6 hr. Within 12 hr, organelles labeled with WGA-HRP in pericytes were identical to those observed in endothelia. Blood-borne native HRP, entering cells by bulk-phase endocytosis, was neither directed to the Golgi complex nor transferred across nonfenestrated cerebral endothelia. The results suggest that blood-borne molecules taken into the cerebral endothelium by adsorptive endocytosis and conveyed to the Golgi complex can, either by themselves or as vehicles for other molecules excluded from the brain, undergo transcytosis through the blood-brain barrier without compromising the integrity of the barrier.\r"

An inverse relationship between iron status and receptor number was found, whereas a direct relationship existed between erythropoiesis and receptors. These changes in receptor number can be explained by assuming that the number of tissue receptors determined the number of plasma receptors and that the erythroid cells possessed most of the body's receptors. Increases in plasma receptors lagged behind the appearance of circulating reticulocytes, suggesting that receptors were released to the plasma during the terminal phase of erythrocyte maturation.\r"

Each variant contains a single gene 4 mutation that permits viral growth in the presence of the antibody. Variant mutations were identified in six distinct neutralization regions in VP8 and VP5. Five of the six neutralization regions were found in VP8. The VP8 regions were primarily associated with strain-specific or limited heterotypic rotavirus neutralization.

The histone-DNA interactions in each complex have been probed with exonuclease III, DNase I, dimethyl sulfate, and UV light. Whereas DNase I and exonuclease III readily detect interactions between histones and DNA, UV light and dimethyl sulfate do not. In contrast to histone-DNA interactions, we demonstrate that intimate sequence-specific contacts between the same sea urchin 5S DNA and the Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) are readily detected with UV light. Since the sensitivity of UV light for TFIIIA contacts is similar to its sensitivity for other regulatory protein-DNA contacts, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of using UV light to selectively visualize regulatory protein-DNA interactions in vivo with little or no interference from histone-DNA interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The 67-kDa calelectrin is the largest member of a family of Ca2+-binding proteins that associate with membranes and phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Oligonucleotide probes based on peptide sequences obtained from purified bovine 67-kDa calelectrin were used to screen a human retina cDNA library, and the complete primary structure of human 67-kDa calelectrin was deduced by DNA sequence analysis. The protein consists of eight 68-amino acid repeats separated by linking sequences of variable lengths. It is highly similar to the human lipocortin I and II sequences, each of which contains four such repeats. The amino termini of the three proteins show no sequence similarity; however, in the repeated regions the proteins are 42-45% identical in sequence. Analysis of the 16 repeats from the three proteins provides insights into the structural basis for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding. These data place the calelectrins and the lipocortins into the same gene family and suggest that these proteins have similar functions and have evolved from a common ancestor.\r"

Transient expression in COS-7 cells was used to evaluate the transcription phenotype of clustered base substitution mutations in the human rRNA promoter. The promoter consists of two major elements: a large upstream region, composed of several domains, that lies between nucleotides -234 and -107 relative to the transcription initiation site and affects transcription up to 100-fold and a core element that lies between nucleotides -45 and +20 and affects transcription up to 1000-fold. The upstream region is able to retain partial function when positioned within 100-160 nucleotides of the transcription initiation site, but it cannot stimulate transcription from distances of greater than or equal to 600 nucleotides. In addition, we demonstrate, using mouse-human hybrid rRNA promoters, that the sequences responsible for human species-specific transcription in vivo appear to reside in both the core and upstream elements, and sequences from the mouse rRNA promoter cannot be substituted for them.\r"

This protein whose biological function is unknown consists of a single polypeptide chain of 276 amino acid residues including 8 tryptophan residues and has a pyroglutamyl residue at the amino terminus. The location of the two disulfide bonds in the polypeptide chain was also established. The three glycans, whose structure was elucidated with the aid of 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, were sialylated N-biantennas. The molecular weight calculated from the polypeptide and carbohydrate structure is 38,478, which is close to the reported value of approximately equal to 41,000 based on physicochemical measurements. The predicted secondary structure appeared to be comprised of 23% alpha-helix, 27% beta-sheet, and 22% beta-turns. The three N-glycans were found to be located in beta-turn regions. An unexpected finding was made by computer analysis of the sequence data; this revealed that Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein is closely related to antigens of the major histocompatibility complex in amino acid sequence and in domain structure. There was an unusually high degree of sequence homology with the alpha chains of class I histocompatibility antigens. Moreover, this plasma protein was shown to be a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein appears to be a truncated secretory major histocompatibility complex-related molecule, and it may have a role in the expression of the immune response.\r"

Interestingly, the enzyme specifically binds only one of four stereoisomers of BBP that were present in the buffer solution in which the CPA crystals were soaked. Furthermore, the species observed to bind to the enzyme is the hydrated form of the ketone. This is rather surprising since the hydrated form of BBP is expected to be present in aqueous solution at a concentration of less than 0.2%. Hence, the enzyme-inhibitor complex is most stable with a species resembling a structure along the reaction coordinate of a chemical reaction rather than a species resembling a reactant or a product. Important structural information regarding the catalytic conformations of active-site residues spanning the S'1-S2 subsites of the enzyme is provided from the results of these x-ray diffraction experiments. The structure of the CPA-hydrated BBP complex provides support for a promoted-water hydrolytic mechanism, although it is not certain whether the enzyme has actually participated in the hydration reaction at the ketone carbonyl of BBP.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the solution structure of RNA containing the branch point/3' splice site region of the first intervening sequence (IVS1) of human beta-globin pre-mRNA by nuclease mapping and NMR. Nuclease mapping indicates that there are two distinct structural domains: one contains the branch point region, and the other includes the 3' splice site and second exon sequences. In the branch point domain, the adenosine at which the RNA branch forms appears to be in the loop of a stem/loop structure. The branch point structure does not appear to interact with other parts of the RNA, since its unique nuclease digestion pattern is conserved among transcripts containing the entire intron or only the branch point region. This is confirmed by a comparison of the NMR spectra of two RNA transcripts; a distinct set of resonances appears in the spectra of the RNA containing only branch sequences or including 3' splice site/exon 2 sequences. NMR studies further show that the 3' splice site/exon 2 domain has a lower melting temperature than the branch point domain, suggesting that the two regions are distinct dynamically as well as structurally. Nuclease mapping studies of adenovirus major late IVS1 indicate that this RNA has structural features in common with the human beta-globin transcript.\r"

Reconstitution of normal beta chains with truncated or substituted alpha chains was used to form truncated (des-Val1-alpha 1) and substituted ([[1-13C]Gly1]alpha 1) tetrameric hemoglobin analogs. Structural homology of the analogs with untreated native hemoglobin was established by using several spectroscopic and physical methods. Functional studies indicate that the reconstituted tetrameric protein containing des-Val1-alpha chains has a higher affinity for oxygen, is less influenced by chloride ions or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and shows lower cooperativity than native hemoglobin. These results confirm the key functional role of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus in mediating cooperative oxygen binding across the dimer interface. The NH2-terminal pK1/2 value was determined for the [13C]glycine-substituted analog to be 7.46 +/- 0.09 at 15 degrees C in the carbon monoxide-liganded form. This value, measured directly by 13C NMR, agrees with the determination made by the less-direct 13CO2 method and confirms the role of this residue as a contributor to the alkaline Bohr effect; however, it is inconsistent with the presence of an NH2-terminal salt bridge to the carboxylate of Arg-141 of the alpha chain in the liganded form.\r"

A HeLa cell extract showed neither the supercoiling activity nor the preference for the transcription of ccc DNA over linear DNA. These activities could be added to the HeLa cell extract. Phosphocellulose fractionation of the posterior silk gland extract yielded a flow-through fraction and a 0.6 M KCl eluate fraction that were required for the supercoiling and for the efficient transcription of the ccc template in the acceptor HeLa cell extract. The 0.6 M KCl fraction had a DNA topoisomerase II activity, and the flow-through fraction contained a supercoiling factor that, with the aid of topoisomerase II, introduced negative supercoils into ccc DNA. When both fractions were added to the posterior silk gland extract, more supercoiling occurred than with the extract alone. Several genes were optimally transcribed under various extents of supercoiling. The fibroin gene and adenovirus 2 major late promoter were fully transcribed as partially supercoiled templates. The sericin gene required more supercoiling for full transcription, whereas no preference for supercoiling was seen with the transcription of hsp70. These results suggest that DNA topology plays a role in the regulation of gene expression.\r"

Furthermore, this factor binds a similar sequence in the 72-base-pair repeat enhancer element of simian virus 40. We show here that NF-kappa B, an inducible B-cell-specific factor that binds the kappa immunoglobulin light chain gene enhancer, also binds the H2TF1 regulatory sequence. Methylation-interference experiments demonstrate that NF-kappa B closely interacts with six of the eight symmetrically positioned guanines that contact H2TF1. These experiments suggest that NF-kappa B may play a role in class I major histocompatibility gene expression and that H2TF1 and NF-kappa B may be related DNA-binding proteins.\r"

The specific activity of acetylhydrolase has been assayed in maternal rabbit plasma prior to and throughout pregnancy and after parturition. The specific activity of acetylhydrolase was 131 +/- 8 nmol.min-1.ml-1 of plasma (mean +/- SEM) in the nonpregnant rabbit. Similar specific activities were found throughout the first half of pregnancy; however, on day 15 the acetylhydrolase activity began to decrease and reached a minimum around day 27. Within 24-48 hr following delivery, the specific activity of the enzyme increased to the levels found in the nonpregnant animals. The specific activity of acetylhydrolase in fetuses (gestational ages of 21-30 days) and neonates increased from 22 nmol.min-1.ml-1 of plasma (21-day-old) to 328 nmol.min-1.ml-1 of plasma (35-day-old rabbits). The decrease in enzymatic activity of the pregnant rabbit plasma cannot be accounted for by the presence of an inhibitor as determined by plasma-mixing experiments with nonpregnant and pregnant (27-day) plasma. The properties of this enzyme in the rabbit were consistent with those reported by others, i.e., substrate specificity, inactivation by heat and various inhibitors, and Ca2+ independency. The activity of PAF acetylhydrolase was associated primarily with the high density lipoprotein fraction in rabbit plasma. The decrease of this enzymatic activity during pregnancy may serve to remove the protective effect on myometrium to allow an increased amount of PAF to come in contact with this tissue.\r"

To examine whether these putative signal peptides are functionally equivalent to signal peptides of secretory proteins, cDNA coding for a fusion protein was produced, in which the signal peptide for preproparathyroid hormone was replaced with the putative signal peptide of cytochrome P450IIC2. The translational product of RNA synthesized in vitro from the cDNA was neither processed nor translocated by chicken oviduct microsomal membranes in a reticulocyte cell-free system but was resistant to extraction from the membranes by alkaline solutions. In addition, the translation of the hybrid RNA was arrested by signal recognition particle. Unlike most signal peptides, the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2-terminal sequence does not contain basic amino acids preceding the hydrophobic core. Introduction by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of lysine and arginine at the NH2 terminus resulted in a fusion protein that was partially processed by the microsomal membranes, with translocation across the membrane of both the processed and unprocessed proteins. The positive charges convert the cytochrome P450IIC2 NH2 terminus from a combination membrane insertion-halt transfer signal to a more classical secretory membrane-insertion signal, possibly by altering the orientation of the signal peptide in the membrane.\r"

Here we have used a reconstituted human U1 snRNP together with snRNP monoclonal antibodies to define the RNA binding sites of one of the U1 snRNP-specific proteins. When Sm monoclonal antibody (specific for the B', B, and D proteins of U snRNPs) was bound to U1 snRNPs prior to micrococcal nuclease digestion, the same approximately equal to 24 nucleotide fragment of U1 RNA (corresponding to nucleotides 120-143 and termed the \"Sm domain\") was protected as when no antibody was bound prior to digestion. In contrast, when RNP monoclonal antibody, which reacts with the U1 snRNP-specific Mr 70,000 protein, was bound, additional U1 RNA regions were protected against nuclease digestion. This phenomenon, which we term \"antibody-mediated nuclease protection,\" was exploited to map the position of the Mr 70,000 protein to stem-loop I of U1 RNA. However, there were also sites of Mr 70,000 protein interaction with more 3'-ward regions of U1 RNA, particularly the Sm domain. This indicates that in the three-dimensional structure of the U1 snRNP, the RNP and Sm antigens are in contact with each other. The proximity of the Mr 70,000 protein's RNA binding site (stem-loop I) to the functionally important 5' end of U1 RNA suggests that this protein may be involved in the recognition of, or stabilization of base pairing with, pre-mRNA 5' splice sites.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of glucocorticoids on gene expression of rat class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) was investigated. A cDNA clone for the beta-subunit of human ADH (ADH2) was used to analyze class I ADH mRNA levels in rat hepatoma cells, which are known to contain a functional glucocorticoid receptor. RNA gel blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from these cells showed hybridization of the human ADH2 cDNA probe to a single approximately equal to 1500-base RNA species. Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone (0.1 nM to 1 microM) caused a dose-dependent increase in total cellular class I ADH mRNA levels by a factor of 2-4. Maximal levels were reached within 18-24 hr of treatment. This effect was reversible following withdrawal of dexamethasone. The glucocorticoid induction of class I ADH mRNA does not seem to require ongoing protein synthesis since treatment of the cells with cycloheximide did not affect the increase in class I ADH mRNA levels by dexamethasone. The human ADH2 gene contains both upstream and within the coding region sequence motifs that display homology with response elements of genes positively regulated by glucocorticoids. These data suggest a receptor-mediated transcriptional enhancement of the ADH2 gene as the mechanism of regulation. However, analysis of RNA decay in cells treated with actinomycin D indicates that the dexamethasone-induced increase in class I ADH mRNA might, at least in part, be due to enhanced ADH mRNA stability.\r"

  ".W": "The twist is a fundamental geometric property of nucleic acids. Calculation of the twist in the most general case requires detailed specification of the three-dimensional path of each strand, but many important cases may be analyzed by considering only the twist difference. If C1, C2, and C3 are three distinct space curves, the twist difference about C1 is defined as Tw(C3, C1) - Tw(C2, C1). We show here that this difference measures the rotation of the correspondence surface joining C1 to C2 about the correspondence surface joining C1 to C3. This result has application to DNA containing local nonuniformities, such as denatured regions, cruciforms, and other altered structures. It also facilitates the calculation of twist for three-stranded structures, including D-loops in mitochondrial DNA and replication and transcription intermediates. The twist difference may also be used to simplify greatly the analysis of twist changes in duplex DNA due to winding on surfaces, such as histones and certain enzymes. In such cases the strand-axis twist of DNA divides into two independent terms. The first term arises from the twist of the local reference frame, and the second arises from the rotation of either strand about the duplex axis as measured in the local reference frame. Twist changes consequent to nucleosome winding, for example, arise from the twist of the nucleosome axis, a straight line, about the DNA axis plus the rotation of either strand of the DNA about its axis in the reference frame of the cylinder.\r"

The defective sorting of cell surface mouse mammary tumor virus glycoproteins in CR4 cells was complemented after fusion with either normal rat hepatocytes or uninfected HTC cells. Indirect immunofluorescence of transient heterokaryons revealed that the regulated localization of mouse mammary tumor virus glycoproteins was dependent upon glucocorticoid treatment and required de novo RNA and protein synthesis. Thus, a glucocorticoid-regulated trafficking activity, unrelated to mouse mammary tumor virus sequences, which is induced in both adult rat liver and cultured hepatoma cells, can act in trans to mediate an intracellular sorting pathway for membrane glycoproteins.\r"

Subclones derived from these cultures are initially homogeneous with respect to the presence or absence of a specific cell surface carbohydrate but gradually revert back to a heterogeneous population. Cells of homogeneous subclones having both the sialosyl-LEa and 43-9F cell surface antigens and other subclones lacking them were injected subcutaneously in nude mice. All clones expressing these tumor-associated cell surface carbohydrates were found to be highly tumorigenic, whereas those lacking them were nontumorigenic or, at most, weakly tumorigenic. Clones having the tumor-associated cell surface carbohydrates were more resistant to cytotoxic attack by purified mouse natural killer cells than those clones lacking these carbohydrates, suggesting that the tumorigenicity of the former clones may be influenced by immunoprotective effects of these novel carbohydrates.\r"

We found that extracellular creatine regulates the level of expression of these creatine transporters in L6 rat muscle cells. L6 myoblasts maintained for 24 hr in medium containing 1 mM creatine exhibited 1/3rd of the creatine transport activity of cells maintained for 24 hr in medium without creatine. Down-regulation of creatine transport was partially reversed when creatine-fed L6 cells were incubated for 24 hr in medium lacking creatine. Down-regulation of creatine transport occurred independently of amino acid and glucose transport. Furthermore, the down-regulation of creatine transporters by extracellular creatine was slowed by inhibitors of protein synthesis. These results suggest that creatine induces the expression of a protein that functionally inactivates the creatine transporters. Regulation of creatine transport by extracellular creatine also was observed in L6 myotubes and in cultures of human myoblasts and myotubes. Hence, the activity of creatine transport represents another site for the regulation of creatine homeostasis.\r"

At saturating concentrations of substrates, five of six enzymes assayed for more active (three to fifteen times) in permeabilized embryos than in permeabilized eggs, but no fertilization-related differences are seen in homogenates prepared from these same permeabilized cells. Furthermore, enzyme activity in homogenates always exceeds that in the permeabilized cell suspensions. This difference in enzyme reaction rates between unfertilized eggs and fertilized eggs is not due to differences in the diffusibility of substrates into the permeabilized cells. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) in permeabilized cells was studied in greater detail and has the following characteristics. (i) Regulation of activity persists during early development. (ii) This regulation is not mediated by diffusible allosteric agents. (iii) Stimulation at fertilization is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium and is further promoted by cytoplasmic alkalinization. (iv) The microenvironment experienced by this enzyme intracellularly differs from that of the enzyme in homogenates as evidenced by markedly different pH vs. activity profiles. These results indicate that the regulatory status of enzymes is preserved in electrically permeabilized cells and suggest that this regulation depends on some cell structural feature(s) that is (are) destroyed upon homogenization.\r"

This gave three classes of glycans (polysaccharides, endoglycosidase H-resistant glycopeptides, and endoglycosidase H-released oligosaccharides), which were tested for their ability to block agglutination of amoebae from vegetative, aggregation (8-hr), and late-aggregation (13-hr) stages of development. The endoglycosidase H-resistant glycopeptides from 8-hr cells inhibited agglutination of disaggregated 8-hr cells but not vegetative or 13-hr cells. The 8-hr polysaccharide and endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides did not inhibit. The glycopeptides from 8-hr cells were resolved into five species by electrophoresis in borate-containing buffer. Two of these had agglutination-inhibiting activity, and three did not. None of the glycan fractions from vegetative or 13-hr cells inhibited agglutination of vegetative, 8-, or 13-hr cells. These data implicate specific cell surface glycans in aggregation-stage intercellular cohesion and suggest that both these glycans and receptors for them are developmentally regulated.\r"

These estimations used the binomial formula on data from recipients of identical portions of marrow mixtures containing two distinguishable cell types. Analysis of variance was used to compare repeated tests within each recipient. Values of pi s or pi c, probabilities that two independently sampled cells were descended from the same PSC, were also estimated, as this does not require the unverified condition that all PSCs contribute equally to the differentiated cell population. Several months after transplantation, erythrocytes were descended from only a single PSC per 1-2 X 10(5) marrow cells injected, several times rarer than previously reported. Percentages of erythrocyte and lymphocyte types in each recipient were closely correlated, with r values ranging from 0.86 to 0.94, in groups receiving 2-8 X 10(5) marrow cells; apparently the same precursors repopulated both myeloid and lymphoid lines in each recipient, as expected of true PSCs. Our data did not fit the clonal succession model, which predicts sequential activation of new PSCs and deactivation of old. Between 76 and 154 days, differentiated erythrocyte precursors were probably exhausted, with no evidence for new precursor activation or for further change between 154 and 250 days. The percentage of newly produced erythrocytes (reticulocytes) of each donor type varied little when individual recipients were followed between 165 and 295 days after transplantation, and variances within recipients were similar at marrow doses from 8 to 200 X 10(5) cells, further contradicting models of sequential activation and deactivation of PSC clones. Thus, transplanted PSCs were continually active during much of the recipient's lifespan.\r"

The variance was neither increased by differences in diet during the postweaning rapid growth period (prior to assay for drinking choice) nor diminished by uniformity of treatment during this period, suggesting that significant differentiation had occurred prior to weaning. The large variance between animals could be explained by assuming that the genetic role in consumption of alcohol by C57BL mice is permissive--a relative insensitivity to the aversive orosensory and pharmacological effects of 10% alcohol--rather than a specific drug-seeking predisposition.\r"

Four different pairs of gene constructs, which were identical except that one member of each pair lacked all introns, were compared for expression of mRNA after introduction into the murine germ line by microinjection of fertilized eggs. The expression of two chimeric genes, made by fusing either the mouse metallothionein I or the rat elastase 1 promoter/enhancer to the rat growth hormone gene, was assayed in fetal liver or pancreas, respectively, while two natural genes, an oligonucleotide-marked mouse metallothionein I gene and the human beta-globin gene, were assayed in fetal liver. In each case there was, on average, 10- to 100-fold more mRNA produced from the intron-containing construct. Moreover, mRNA levels were proportional to the relative rates of transcription that were measured in isolated nuclei. However, when the expression of the two mouse metallothionein I gene-based constructs was tested after transfection into cultured cells, little difference was observed. These observations suggest that introns play a role in facilitating transcription of microinjected genes and that this effect may be manifest only on genes exposed to developmental influences.\r"

The intron/exon structure of the three genes in locus 2 is highly conserved with respect to size and position. These genes contain two introns, whereas the gene from locus 1 contains three introns. Although in most cases the amino acid sequences in the transit peptide part of different rbcS genes from the same species varied considerably more than the corresponding mature amino acid sequences, one exception found in tomato and potato indicates that the transit peptide of rbcS could have a special function. A comparison of the rbcS genes of higher plants with those of prokaryotes offers suggestive evidence that introns first served as spacer material in the process of exon shuffling and then were removed stepwise during the evolution of higher plants.\r"

GdX is a single-copy gene, is conserved in evolution, and has the features of a \"housekeeping\" gene. At its 5' end, a cluster of CpG dinucleotides is methylated on the inactive X chromosome and unmethylated on the active X chromosome. The GdX gene can code for a 157 amino acid protein, GdX. Residues 1-74 of GdX show 43% identity to ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76 amino acid protein. The COOH-terminal moiety of GdX is characterized in its central part (residues 110-128) by a sequence homologous to the COOH-terminal hormonogenic site of thyroglobulin. The structural organization of the GdX protein suggests the existence of a family of genes, in addition to the ubiquitin gene, that could play specific roles in key cellular processes, possibly through protein-protein recognition.\r"

To discover the features of Tc1 target sites, we have sequenced the sites of seven independent Tc1 transpositions into unc-22 and three other sites. Our comparison of these and two other sites from the literature indicates that in all cases Tc1 integrates at the dinucleotide T-A when it is flanked both 5' and 3' by particular preferred nucleotides. Our analysis revealed the following consensus target for Tc1 integration: G-A-K-A-T-A-T-G-T, in which K = G or T. This target site sequence specificity has implications both for the mechanism of Tc1 transposition and the use of Tc1 in cloning genes by transposon-tagging.\r"

All compounds tested selectively labeled the alpha chain of the class II molecules. This was true when testing class II molecules on cell membranes or solubilized in detergents. The COOH-terminal conjugate of HEL(49-61) with (4-azidobenzoyl)cystine preferentially labeled I-Ak. However, addition of hydroxyl or iodine substituents to the photoreactive moiety increased the labeling efficiency and resulted in labeling of the other class II molecules. The data suggest that the photoreactive groups enhanced the binding affinities of these peptides to class II molecules, reflected by the increased labeling efficiencies. Conversely, introduction of an iodine substitution into the tyrosine residue of HEL(46-61) or HEL(49-61) strongly decreased the photoaffinity labeling, possibly due to steric interference with ligand binding to class II molecules. Judicious use of photoaffinity probes that conserve binding specificity of the peptide should be useful for mapping the antigen-binding site of a class II molecule.\r"

To investigate the mechanism of the DAF defect, DNA and mRNA from normal and PNH leukocytes were compared in blot hybridization assays by using DAF cDNA and oligonucleotide probes. Southern analyses of DNA from normal cells revealed a single gene spanning approximately equal to 35 kilobases of DNA. Six HindIII banding patterns were distinguishable among normal individuals. In family studies, the patterns segregated as three homozygous and three heterozygous genotypes deriving from three haplotypes: A, B, and C with frequencies of 0.47, 0.36, and 0.17, respectively. Oligonucleotide mapping localized the polymorphic HindIII sites to two noncoding regions in the vicinity of exons encoding (i) the protein oligosaccharide-rich domain and (ii) the mRNA 3'-untranslated region. Analyses of DNA from DAF-negative leukocytes of eight PNH patients demonstrated restriction fragment profiles identical to those of normal individuals for all enzymes studied. Three patients had the BC (normals = 3/32), three patients had the AA (normals = 6/32), and two patients had the AC (normals = 8/32) HindIII genotype. Of the three PNH patients exhibiting the BC genotype, family studies of two demonstrated the expected inheritance patterns, and RNA gel blot analyses of two showed mRNA transcripts indistinguishable from those in normal cells. The absence of DAF gene or mRNA alterations in affected PNH cells that lack other glycolipid-anchored proteins as well as DAF argues that the lesion underlying PNH cells resides in the glycolipid-anchor pathway.\r"

The activation of both PtdIns turnover and LDL metabolism is inhibited by high density lipoprotein. Thus, LDL at hormonal concentrations causes general cellular activation.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies of HIV labeled with 5-nitroxide stearate (N-oxy-4',4'-dimethyloxazolidine derivative of ketostearate) showed a low \"fluidity\" at 37 degrees C, similar to other enveloped RNA viruses and erythrocytes and probably due to the high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. Ethanol (50%) completely disrupts the envelope, contributing to the rapid inactivation of HIV by ethanol. Contrarily, heating to 57 degrees C causes much less fluidization, and this heating may play a role in the slower viral inactivation at high temperatures. Should a critical minimum ordering in the HIV envelope be necessary for viral stability and infectivity, manipulating the lipid composition or fluidizing the HIV membrane, or both, may provide an untried therapeutic approach.\r"

  ".W": "The heart has not been regarded as a major target organ of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxicity notwithstanding that lethal cardiac dysfunction can occur in the absence of histopathological changes. To assess possible TCDD cardiotoxicity, we studied the effect of TCDD five days after treatment (10 micrograms/kg of body weight; single dose given i.p. in corn oil) on the contractility of guinea pig right ventricular papillary muscle. Controls were treated with corn oil. TCDD treatment significantly decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness. In papillary muscles from TCDD-treated guinea pigs, the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol (0.03-0.3 microM) was decreased by a mean of 65% (P less than 0.001), and the enhancement in the velocity of relaxation was 60% less than in the controls (P less than 0.05). On the other hand, TCDD treatment did not alter the positive inotropic effect of lower concentrations of isoproterenol (0.1-10 nM). After TCDD, responsiveness to low-frequency stimulation (0.1 and 0.25 Hz) was enhanced, responsiveness to increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration was attenuated, and isoproterenol-elicited aftercontractions in K+-depolarized preparations were increased in magnitude. Collectively, the latter findings suggest that in addition to decreasing beta-adrenergic responsiveness, TCDD increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in papillary muscle. Finally, slow Ca2+ channels were not blocked after TCDD treatment, inasmuch as isoproterenol restored contractility equally effectively in K+-depolarized TCDD-treated and control papillary muscles. Our findings indicate that TCDD causes a specific pattern of cardiac dysfunction in a mammalian species, selectively augmenting or decreasing different cardiac responses. The cardiac changes are consistent with reported membrane effects of TCDD; further, they suggest that the heart may be a major target organ for TCDD toxicity.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the cpl gene of Cp-1, encoding a muramidase (CPL), has been determined. The 3' regions of the cpl and lytA coding sequences show considerable nucleotide sequence homology and the carboxyl-terminal domains of the deduced amino acid sequences of these lysins are quite similar: 73 of the carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acid residues are identical, and of the 69 substitutions, 55 are conservative. Comparisons between CPL, the pneumococcal amidase, and the muramidase of the fungus Chalaropsis sp. (an enzyme that also degrades the pneumococcal cell wall) strongly suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domains of CPL and of the amidase might be responsible for the specific recognition of choline-containing cell walls, as well as for the noncompetitive inhibition of the catalytic activity of these enzymes by the pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid or by high concentrations of choline. In addition, the active center of these enzymes should be located in their amino-terminal domains. Our results suggest an evolutionary relationship between phage and host lysins.\r"

The probe was species specific and detected A. marginale DNA derived from infected bovine erythrocytes and adult Dermacentor ticks infected either as nymphs or adults. Tick infection was confirmed by microscopy and test feeding on a susceptible calf. The sensitivity of the probe is suitable for detecting infected ticks in experimental and field epizootiology studies.\r"

Using electrophysiological methods, we found that the appearance of action potentials in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells can be explained by an increase in the density of Na+ channels. The functional properties of Na+ channels in PC12 cells are similar to those described for peripheral nerves but appear to be different from Na+ channels synthesized in Xenopus oocytes injected with brain type II Na+ -channel mRNA. To determine if PC12 cells express the brain type II Na+ -channel gene, we performed RNase-protection analyses using probes that can distinguish between the brain type I and type II Na+ -channel mRNAs. The results from these studies indicate that undifferentiated PC12 cells express the type II but not the type I Na+ -channel gene. Treatment with nerve growth factor increases expression of the type II Na+ -channel gene but has no effect on type I gene expression. Our findings suggest that Na+ -channel excitability in PC12 cells is due to the specific induction of the brain type II gene by nerve growth factor.\r"

  ".U": "88124956\r", 
  ".W": "The molecular mechanisms of myelin formation/reformation in the central nervous system are unknown. In previous work we have demonstrated that mature oligodendrocytes (OLG) respond to a signal(s), elicited by their adhesion to a substratum, by turning on a myelinogenic metabolism. Events occurring within 24 hr of adhesion include generation of diacylglycerol, activation of protein kinase C, phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, and enhanced synthesis of myelin lipids and proteins. To elucidate the mechanism(s) of signal transduction, we have investigated whether OLG-substratum interaction influences the level of basal cAMP and the expression of receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase. By using ovine brain OLG we have found that adhesion to a polylysine-coated surface for 24 hr increased the basal level of cAMP 2-fold and altered the expression (assessed by cAMP production) of receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase. Isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist) augmented cAMP from 4 to 26 pmol/mg of protein in adhering OLG but had no such effect in nonattached OLG. Adhesion of OLG was accompanied by rapid synthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen, a class of lipids believed to be associated with beta-adrenergic receptors. Nonattached OLG responded to prostaglandin E1 with only a 3-fold stimulation in their cAMP content; in attached OLG, 6-fold stimulation was observed. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide elicited a 3-fold increase in cAMP in nonattached OLG but, following 24 hr of attachment, OLG did not respond to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The increase of cellular cAMP levels was accompanied by a 2.5-fold gain in protein kinase A. OLG-substratum adhesion resulted also in phosphorylation of the OLG/myelin protein, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase, which proved to be a substrate for cAMP and phospholipid-, Ca2+-dependent protein kinases. These findings, in conjunction with our earlier work, implicate cAMP and diacylglycerol in signaling myelinogenesis; they suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of myelin basic protein and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase may be key processes in the cascade of events that are initiated by adhesion of OLG to a polylysine surface (possibly acting as a surrogate for axons) and culminate in the reformation of myelin.\r"

  ".U": "88124958\r", 
  ".W": "The synaptic function of somatostatin-containing fibers in the nervous system is controversial. Therefore, we used a slice preparation of the rat brain stem to test the electrophysiological effects of prosomatostatin-derived peptides on neurons of the solitary tract complex, which contains an abundance of somatostatin-containing fibers and cell bodies. Superfusion of both somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 (the precursor for somatostatin-14), but not somatostatin-28-(1-12) or -(1-10), predominantly inhibited spontaneous spike and subthreshold (probably synaptic) activity. In intracellular recordings, somatostatin-14 and -28 hyperpolarized most neurons in association with a slight (10-35%) but reproducible decrease in input resistance. These hyperpolarizing responses were augmented in depolarized cells and persisted in cells in which spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials became depolarizing after Cl- injection. These data suggest that somatostatin receptors regulate a K+ conductance. In voltage-clamp studies, somatostatin-28 and -14 induced a steady outward current and augmented the voltage-dependent, nonactivating outward K+ conductance (IM) shown to be blocked by activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. These results suggest (i) that somatostatin-containing elements in the solitary tract complex play an inhibitory role through the activation of postsynaptic permeability to potassium ions and (ii) that the same ion channel type may be coregulated by two neurotransmitter candidates, somatostatin and acetylcholine, through a reciprocal control mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "88124959\r", 
  ".W": "Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is localized to hypothalamic neurons and is a potent inhibitor of basal and growth hormone (GH)-releasing factor-induced GH secretion in the rat. It also acts similarly to inhibit opiate- and stress-induced prolactin (PRL) release. To determine the physiological significance of the peptide in the control of the release of these two hormones, a highly specific antiserum against GRP was injected into the third brain ventricle to immunoneutralize hypothalamic GRP. The injection of the antiserum initially did not alter levels of the hormones; however, both PRL and GH levels in the plasma began to increase within 3 and 3.5 hr, respectively. They were still significantly elevated 24 hr after the injection. There was no change in the plasma levels of either hormone in animals injected intraventricularly with a similar volume of normal rabbit serum (NRS). Mean plasma GH levels 24 hr after antiserum injection were more than twice those of the NRS-injected controls, whereas the PRL concentrations were 14-fold higher in the antiserum injected as compared to the control NRS-injected animals. A second similar injection of antiserum 24 hr after the first administration resulted in a slight and transient further increase in both GH and PRL levels so that they were both significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than those of the animals given a second injection of NRS. The anti-GRP antiserum was highly specific for GRP by radioimmunoassay procedures and this antiserum produced positive immunostaining of GRP neuronal perikarya and terminals within discrete hypothalamic nuclei. Beaded fibers and terminals were observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the area lateral and dorsal to the SCN in the region of the periventricular nucleus (PeVN). GRP-positive perikarya were observed in the parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. In addition, GRP-positive cell bodies were observed in the PeVN in close proximity to the third ventricle. Furthermore, the median eminence displayed no immunostaining for GRP, and all traces of positive staining were abolished by preabsorption of the antiserum with GRP-27 (30 micrograms/ml), confirming the specificity of the antiserum. The combined results with immunoneutralization of GRP and the immunostaining of GRP neuronal elements in the hypothalamus support the physiological role of this peptide in the inhibitory control of both GH and PRL release.\r"

  ".U": "88124960\r", 
  ".W": "It is generally accepted that the prothoracic glands of insects produce ecdysone, which is converted by a 20-monooxygenase in peripheral tissues to the major molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone. Incubation in vitro of the prothoracic glands of larval or pupal Manduca sexta in the presence of a hemolymph protein fraction (HPF) increased the ecdysteroid content of the medium almost 8-fold. A comparable increase was noted when HPF was added to medium preconditioned with prothoracic glands but from which the glands had been removed. We used a differential RIA to show that a major product of the prothoracic glands in vitro cross-reacts with antiserum (20-hydroxyecdysone-2-succinylthyroglobulin amide; H-2) that retains affinity to ecdysteroids having a modified A ring. However, this product did not bind to antiserum (ecdysone-22-succinylthyroglobulin amide; H-22) that has affinity mainly for ecdysteroids modified at the side chain. We employed radiolabeled precursor studies with prothoracic glands in vitro and a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, CD, MS) to demonstrate that the major ecdysteroid release from the glands is a mixture of 2-dehydroecdysone and 3-dehydroecdysone (1:2), which is rapidly reduced to ecdysone in the presence of HPF. We postulate that the active component of HPF is 3 beta 3 beta (2 beta)-formin-3(2)-ketoecdysteroid reductase. These results may explain several anomalous observations pertaining to the molting of insect fragments in the absence of prothoracic glands and suggest a complex system for the control of insect molting and metamorphosis.\r"

It was found that some of these glycoproteins are intrinsic membrane proteins with their sugars facing the cytosolic rather than the luminal side. This conclusion was reached by using vesicles from the SER and RER that were sealed and of the same topographical orientation as in vivo. These vesicles were incubated with UDP-[14C]galactose (which does not enter the vesicles) and saturating amounts of soluble galactosyltransferase from milk, an enzyme that does not penetrate the lumen of the vesicles and that specifically adds galactose to terminal N-acetylglucosamine in a beta 1-4 linkage. Radioactive galactose was mainly transferred to SER proteins of apparent molecular mass 56 and 110 kDa and to a lesser extent to RER and SER proteins of apparent molecular mass 46 and 72 kDa. These proteins are intrinsic membrane proteins, based on the inability of sodium carbonate at pH 11.5 to remove them from the membranes. Studies with peptide N-glycosidase F and chemical beta-elimination showed that the 56-kDa protein of the SER vesicles contained terminal N-acetylglucosamine in an O-linkage to the protein. The above results suggest that some sugars of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum may attain their final orientation in the membrane by mechanisms yet to be determined.\r"

Using the Xenopus sequence and similar sequences from the 5' regulatory regions of other estrogen-responsive genes, we derived a consensus sequence 38 nucleotides long. The sequence contains an inverted repeat (5' C-A-G-G-T-C-A-G-A-G-T-G-A-C-C-T-G 3') and an A/T-rich region. Plasmids carrying a single copy of the sequence bound 3-fold-more partially purified estrogen receptor (ER) than did control plasmids when assayed by gel filtration. Maximum specificity for ER binding occurs at 100-150 mM ionic strength and pH 7.5-8.0. Plasmids carrying multiple copies of the sequence bound correspondingly more ER. The dissociation constant for ER bound to the sequence is 0.5 nM. This value is lower by a factor of about 400 than the dissociation constant for ER bound to an equivalent length of plasmid DNA. Portions of the consensus sequence were evaluated for binding efficiency. Plasmids containing the inverted repeat alone bound ER, though less efficiently than did plasmids containing the entire sequence. The A/T-rich region alone was ineffective in binding ER. Linearization of the plasmid DNA did not enhance specific binding efficiency for ER. This model system represents an effective tool for characterization of ER binding to DNA sequences involved in the regulation of gene expression.\r"

This smooth muscle MHC cDNA demonstrates significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence homologies with known sarcomeric MHC genes from rabbit, rat skeletal, and nematode body wall myosin, and even with nonmuscle MHC gene from a slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum), suggesting that smooth muscle, striated muscle, and nonmuscle MHC genes diverged from a common ancestor. The deduced amino acid sequences of the smooth muscle light meromyosin show very similar periodic distributions of hydrophobic and charged residues as found for the light meromyosin of striated muscle MHCs together with a high potential for alpha-helical formation, indicating an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure for the smooth muscle light meromyosin sequences. Furthermore, S1 nuclease mapping has revealed that this smooth muscle MHC gene for SMHC-29 is specifically expressed in smooth muscles of vascular and nonvascular types but not in the striated muscles or nonmuscle cells.\r"

The fact that an immune response was induced also in monkeys is important because normal cells from monkeys, but not from mice, express a low level of cross-reactive p97. Mice immunized with v-p97NY rejected transplants of syngeneic mouse melanoma expressing p97. A rejection response could be detected also when immunization was started 2 days after tumor transplantation, irrespective of whether the transplanted cells grew subcutaneously or as lung metastases. Evidence was obtained that melanoma cells lacking p97 may be killed as \"bystanders\" at the site of an immune response to melanoma cells expressing p97.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of HeLa cells with a DNA topoisomerase I-specific inhibitor, camptothecin, results in rapid cessation of the synthesis of the 45S rRNA precursor. The inhibition of rRNA synthesis is reversible following drug removal and correlates with the presence of camptothecin-trapped topoisomerase I-DNA abortive complexes, which can be detected as topoisomerase I-linked DNA breaks upon lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate. These breaks were found to be concentrated within the transcribed region of human rRNA genes. No such sites can be detected in the inactive human rRNA genes in mouse-human hybrid cells, suggesting a preferential association of topoisomerase I with actively transcribed genes. The distribution of RNA polymerase molecules along the transcription unit of human rRNA genes in camptothecin-treated HeLa cells, as assayed by nuclear run-on transcription, shows a graded decrease of the RNA polymerase density toward the 3' end of the transcription unit; the density is minimally affected near the 5' start of the transcription unit. These results suggest that DNA topoisomerase I is normally involved in the elongation step of transcription, especially when the transcripts are long, and that camptothecin interferes with this role.\r"

  ".U": "88124976\r", 
  ".W": "We have isolated and characterized cDNAs encoding rat galanin from a cDNA library prepared from rat hypothalamic tissue. Analysis of these clones reveals that rat galanin is synthesized initially as part of a 124-amino acid precursor that includes a signal peptide, galanin (29 amino acids), and a 60-amino acid galanin mRNA-associated peptide. In the precursor, galanin includes a C-terminal glycine and is flanked on each side by dibasic tryptic cleavage sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat galanin is 90% similar to porcine galanin, with all three amino acid differences in the C-terminal heptapeptide. The predicted galanin mRNA-associated peptide includes a 35-amino acid sequence that is 78% similar to the previously reported porcine analogue. This sequence is set off by a single basic tryptic cleavage site and includes a 17-amino acid region that is nearly identical to the porcine counterpart. The high interspecies conservation suggests a biological role for this putative peptide. Blot hybridization analysis using rat genomic DNA is consistent with a single galanin-encoding gene. RNA blot analysis of total RNA prepared from rat tissues reveals a single band of hybridizing mRNA that is approximately 900 nucleotides long. Rat galanin mRNA is located predominantly in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Highest central nervous system concentrations are found in the hypothalamus, with lower levels in the cortex and brainstem. Gastrointestinal rat galanin mRNA is most abundant in the duodenum, with progressively lower concentrations in the stomach, small intestine, and colon.\r"

  ".W": "A modified structural model of rhodopsin is presented. Seven (alpha-helical) segments of 24 largely hydrophobic amino acid residues are assembled with exobilayer connecting strands into an aligned set, using the sequences of human red, green, and blue iodopsins (cone pigments) and human and bovine rod rhodopsins. (Aligned set numbering is used in this article). The inner region of the heptahelical hydrophobic domain includes one His-Glu (Asp) ion pair (red, green rod) near the retinylidene moiety in addition to an iminium ion Asp-99 pair. The negative charges posited in the \"point-charge model\" to cause the shift of the retinylidene iminium ion light absorption to longer wavelengths in the protein (\"opsin shift\") are Asp-99 (red, green rod), Glu-102 (red, green), and Glu-138 (rod). Blue iodopsin lacks both an ion pair and a counter charge to the iminium ion in the inner region, a fact that explains its absorption relative to rod rhodopsin. The spectroscopic difference between rod rhodopsin and the red/green iodopsins is due to the influence of Glu-102 in the latter. The red-green difference is due to the net effect of seven OH groups around the chromophore, all such groups being found within one helix turn of the retinylidene location. The tryptophan, which rotates as the retinylidene group isomerizes, may be Trp-142 or Trp-177. The geometric change (the rhodopsin \"photoswitch\") resulting from cis-trans isomerization in the first excited electronic state (S1), ultimately leads to RX (photoactivated rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II) and changes the activity of exobilayer groups, possibly causing dissociation of Lys-83 and Arg-85 from the carboxylate groups at positions 263 and 265.\r"

On the likelihood that such a protein might be a hydroxyproline-rich cell-wall glycoprotein (HRGP), cell walls of a soybean cell culture were extracted by procedures used to obtain soluble basic cell-wall glycoproteins, and the proteins were fractionated and purified. A 33-kDa protein (and possibly a 28-kDa protein) was obtained that has an amino acid distribution similar to that of the cDNA clone. The protein lacks histidine and serine and contains 20% hydroxyproline and 20% proline. The HRGP is thus distinct both in its amino acid content and in its pentameric repeat of Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys, with half of the prolines being hydroxylated.\r"

Neither topoisomerase I nor Sc-2 shows significant fluctuations in content or stability across the cell cycle. In contrast, topoisomerase II undergoes significant cell cycle-dependent alterations in both amount and stability. As cells progress from mitosis into G1, much of the topoisomerase II is degraded. During the first 2 hr of G1, the half life of topoisomerase II is decreased from that measured in asynchronous cell populations by a factor of 7. This suggests that the chromosome condensation/decondensation cycle is coupled to a parallel cycle of synthesis and degradation of topoisomerase II. In control experiments, we also found that the half-life of topoisomerase II is shorter in normal cells than in transformed cells by a factor of 4. Since the number of copies of topoisomerase II per cell is also lower in normal cells, this suggests that control of topoisomerase II stability is altered upon transformation. The stability of topoisomerase I and Sc-2 does not differ significantly between normal and transformed cells.\r"

This has been interpreted to mean either that the synthesis per se of proteins is a step in the oscillatory feedback loop or merely that certain unstable protein(s) are required at certain times of the cycle to complete the feedback loop. We report here that Neurospora strains bearing the clock mutation frq-7 are relatively insensitive to the resetting action of the protein-synthesis-inhibitor cycloheximide. Protein synthesis itself in this mutant is inhibited by the drug to the same extent as in wild type. Since the clock of frq-7 continues to run relatively unimpeded even in the virtual absence of protein synthesis, it is unlikely that synthesis per se can be a part of the feedback cycle. Rather, we suggest that for normal operation of the Neurospora clock, certain protein(s) with a high turnover rate are required daily and, thus, must be resynthesized each day (at least) during discrete times in the cycle. The frq-7 mutation simultaneously alters several distinct clock characteristics--period length, temperature compensation, and resetting by cycloheximide. A model is presented to unify these observations.\r"

The membrane skeleton of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei consists of a dense array of singlet microtubules (subpellicular microtubules), which are tightly associated to the overlying cell membrane. This study reports the identification of a microtubule-associated protein from Trypanosoma brucei that constitutes a component of the link between this microtubular array and the cell membrane. The protein can bind in vitro both to microtubules and to membrane vesicles or liposomes. Furthermore, it can crosslink microtubules and membrane vesicles, suggesting that it exerts a similar function in the membrane skeleton.\r"

For collagen and fibronectin this increase was 10-to 20-fold, as measured by quantitative blot hybridization analysis. A maximal value was reached at 16-24 hr, with a subsequent gradual decline. Concomitant treatment with cycloheximide prevented the stimulation observed with TGF-beta. Under conditions of confluent growth a clear increase in alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA stability was observed, whereas in subconfluent cells no change in mRNA half-life was found, despite an equally large increase in mRNA levels. We suggest that the mode of action of TGF-beta varies with the target cell and depends on the interplay of a number of complex cellular factors.\r"

The coil-forming regions are 89% identical and the head regions are 88% identical. This similarity is also evident in the DNA sequence of the coding region, the 5' upstream sequences, and the 3' noncoding sequences. The high degree of cross-species identity between bovine and human 40-kDa keratins suggests that there is strong evolutionary pressure to conserve the structure of this keratin.

We have studied the relation between G.C/A.T pressure and tRNA constraints in determining choice of the third nucleotide of eight two-codon sets, using codon usage data obtained from protein genes in four bacterial species, Mycoplasma capricolum, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus, and in liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) chloroplasts. The genomic G + C contents of these range from 25% to 74%. The results demonstrate that tRNA levels act additively to A.T and G.C pressure in affecting contents of A (pairing with *UNN anticodons, in which *U indicates a 2-thiouridine derivative) and C (pairing with GNN anticodons) or G (pairing with CNN anticodons), respectively, in third nucleotide positions of codons.\r"

  ".W": "Splice-junction sequence signals are strongly conserved structural components of eukaryotic genes. These sequences border exon/intron junctions and aid in the process of removing introns by the RNA splicing machinery. Although substantial research has been undertaken to understand the mechanism of splicing, little is known about the origin and evolution of these splice signal sequences. Based on the previously published theory that the primitive genes evolved in pieces from primordial genetic sequences to avoid the interfering stop codons, a \"stop-codon walk\" mechanism is proposed in this paper to have assisted in the evolution of coding genes. This mechanism predicts the presence of stop codons in splice-junction signals inside the introns. Evidence of the consistent presence of stop codons in the splice-junction signals, in a position where they are expected, is shown by the analysis of codon statistics in these signal sequences in the GenBank databank. The results suggest that the splice-junction signals may have evolved from stop codons as a consequence of a selective pressure to avoid stop codons during the original evolution of coding genes. They also suggest that other splice signals within the introns, such as the branch-point sequence, may have evolved from stop codons for similar reasons.\r"

The T4 introns are very closely related, containing phylogenetically conserved sequence elements that allow them to be folded into a core structure that is characteristic of eukaryotic group IA introns. Similarities extend outward to the exon sequences surrounding the three introns. All three introns contain open reading frames (ORFs). Although the intron ORFs are not homologous and occur at different positions, all three ORFs are looped-out of the structure models, with only the 3' ends of each of the ORFs extending into the secondary structure. This arrangement invites interesting speculations on the regulation of splicing by translation. The high degree of similarity between the T4 introns and the eukaryotic group I introns must reflect a common ancestry, resulting either from vertical acquisition of a primordial RNA element or from horizontal transfer.\r"

We show that upon crossing of the inoculated females to SWR/J males, some of their progeny acquire ecotropic proviruses.

Thus an exogenous infection is able to mimic the phenomenon observed in SWR/J X RF/J hybrid mice. Available evidence suggests that this infection occurs during oogenesis in the recipient female.

  ".W": "Deletions in chromosome 7 of the mouse affect the expression of the metallothionein gene Mt-1, which maps on chromosome 8, and steady-state levels of Mt-1 mRNA are reduced to 15-40% of normal in livers of newborn mice homozygous for either the c3H or c14CoS deletion. Glucocorticoids fail to induce hepatic Mt-1 mRNA levels in deletion homozygotes in contrast to normal littermates. However, zinc chloride is effective in inducing Mt-1 mRNA levels in livers of deletion homozygotes as well as of their normal littermates. Other tissues (e.g., kidney and intestine) of deletion homozygotes express basal levels of Mt-1 mRNA higher than those of normal littermates. In the intestine these are furthermore inducible by both hormonal and metal agents. Thus, loss of inducibility of the Mt-1 gene in deletion homozygotes concerns glucocorticoids only and is furthermore restricted to specific cell types (i.e., hepatocytes). The trans-acting factor(s) normally encoded in the deleted region of chromosome 7 appears to be instrumental in conferring on the metallothionein gene in hepatocytes the essential competence to respond to hormonal inducing signals.\r"

  ".U": "88124996\r", 
  ".W": "We have produced a line of transgenic mice that is characterized by prenatal lethality. These mice bear a chimeric plasmid containing the long terminal repeat of the Rous sarcoma virus linked to the coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (pRSV-CAT). Mice heterozygous for the pRSV-CAT integration site are semisterile, producing litters approximately equal to 40% of the average size when crossed to normal mice. Approximately 50% of the progeny from such a cross bear the pRSV-CAT sequences and also produce litters of smaller size. An analysis of embryogenesis revealed that normal numbers of embryos implanted, but 60% failed to develop past day 7. Eight other independent transgenic lines containing RSV-CAT show no evidence of embryonic lethality; thus, it is unlikely that the defect observed is due to the direct effects of RSV-CAT expression. We have found that carrier mice bear a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6 and 17, T(6A2-6A3;17D-17E1), that can explain the apparent dominant embryonic lethality seen in this line. The site of integration has been localized by in situ hybridization at or near the translocation breakpoint in one of the translocated chromosomes (6(17)). Because the foreign DNA is present in one of the translocated chromosomes, we propose that this rearrangement was elicited by the introduction of foreign DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Doxorubicin (DXR) was covalently conjugated to a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 9.2.27 (IgG2a), which recognizes a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expressed preferentially on the surface of human melanoma cells. Immunoconjugates with a molar ratio of DXR to mAb ranging from 2:1 to 10:1 were obtained by coupling the drug via an acid-sensitive linker, cis-aconitic anhydride. The immunoreactivity of mAb 9.2.27 was well retained after conjugation. DXR-mAb 9.2.27 conjugates were found to be 2 orders of magnitude more potent in killing tumor cells in vitro (IC50 = 0.1 microM) than free drug targeted to drug receptor(s). Most significantly, DXR-mAb 9.2.27 immunoconjugates specifically suppressed the growth of established tumors in vivo and prolonged the life-span of tumor-bearing nude mice. This suppression of melanoma growth achieved by the immunoconjugate was both tumor and antibody specific. A biodistribution study indicated that DXR-mAb 9.2.27 conjugates delivered at least 4 times more DXR (3.7% total injected dose per g of tumor) as compared to free DXR alone (0.8% total injected dose per g of tumor) in tumor-bearing nude mice 48 hr postinjection. The tumor-suppressive effects of DXR-mAb 9.2.27 conjugates are even more remarkable since free DXR did not suppress tumor growth in vivo and also because this drug per se is known to be quite ineffective for the treatment of human melanoma.\r"

The response was detectable within 1 min, reached a maximum (225% +/- 8% of baseline) at 6-8 min, and was no longer detectable at 30 min. The half-maximal effect of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 was at 1.8 nM, and 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol showed an estimated EC50 100-fold higher. 1 beta,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, and cholecalciferol had no detectable effect. Human skin fibroblasts with three different types of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 receptor defect did not respond to 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 exposure with cGMP increase; however, the same cells (like normal cells) responded to testosterone or sodium nitroprusside with a rapid rise of cGMP. We conclude that the rapid rise of cGMP in response to calciferols shows an EC50 for 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, a cholecalciferol analog specificity, and a cell line dependency that are all suggestive of mediation through a specific 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 receptor.\r"

  ".W": "An antigen histochemically localized in the nuclei and cytoplasmic granules of normal and leukemic human myeloid cells has been identified as myeloperoxidase (MPO; EC 1.11.1.7). The localization and amount of the enzyme was determined by using a murine monoclonal antibody designated H-43-5 raised against nuclear proteins derived from human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells. The highest amount of nuclear MPO (3.5 micrograms per 10(6) nuclei) was found in granulocytes; less than half of this amount was detected in nuclei from HL-60 cells. Still lower levels were found in nuclei from monocytes and a series of human monomyelocytic leukemia cells. MPO from HL-60 cells was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and fractionated into three components (forms I, II, and III) by CM-cellulose chromatography. Chromatography of these MPO forms on DNA-Sepharose columns confirmed that all three forms of MPO were tightly bound to DNA with apparent relative affinities in the order of form III greater than form II greater than form I. The affinity of MPO form III for DNA was sufficient to enable the formation and elution of DNA-MPO complexes during size-exclusion chromatography at high ionic strength and neutral pH. This form of MPO was also able to shield DNA from strand scission induced by active oxygen species generated by xanthine oxidase acting aerobically on xanthine. These data suggest that intranuclear MPO may help to protect DNA against damage resulting from oxygen radicals produced during myeloid cell maturation and function.\r"

  ".U": "88125015\r", 
  ".W": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic agent for sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons both in vivo and in vitro. We report here that the membrane-permeant cAMP analogs, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP, can replace NGF in promoting long-term survival and neurite outgrowth in cultures of rat neonatal sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons. N6-substituted analogs, including the more commonly used N6,O2'-dibutyryl-cAMP, are less efficacious. Additivity and switching experiments indicate that the cAMP analogs affect the same neuronal population as that maintained by NGF. However, unlike NGF, the cAMP analogs do not evoke somatic hypertrophy. Moreover, studies with sympathetic neurons reveal that the neurotrophic actions of the cAMP analogs, but not of NGF, are blocked by the axial diastereoisomer of adenosine 3',5'-phosphorothioate, a competitive cAMP antagonist. Thus, the mechanism by which cAMP analogs promote neuronal survival and differentiation appears to involve activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, whereas, in contrast, the same effects of NGF neither require nor are mediated by such a pathway. Furthermore, the different efficacies observed with N6- and C8-substituted cAMP analogs suggest that this neurotrophic pathway may involve differential activation of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. The presence of this parallel, cAMP-responsive, neurotrophic pathway in at least two types of NGF-responsive neurons may be developmentally important and has the potential to be exploited for the treatment of injuries or diseases affecting these and possibly other nerve cells.\r"

The purified protein exhibits catalytic and inhibition properties characteristic of AcChoEase and ChoEase and contains three distinct subunits of apparent sizes 110 kDa, 72 kDa, and 58 kDa in the ratio 2:2:1. The discovery of an AcChoEase/ChoEase hybrid asymmetric form has been further supported by (i) the identification of active site properties of AcChoEase in the 110-kDa subunit and of ChoEase in the 72-kDa subunit, (ii) the purification or precipitation of both activities together by, also, a ChoEase-specific monoclonal antibody, and (iii) evidence that all subunits are bound in the asymmetric forms by disulfide bonds. The 58-kDa subunit is the only one that is sensitive to digestion with purified collagenase; it carries the collagenous \"tail\" of the asymmetric form. A model is proposed for this form of AcChoEase.\r"

The formation of morphine, codeine, and oripavine was identified by a specific RIA, HPLC, and GCMS. Thebaine also gave rise to four other compounds, which for the moment are unidentified. NADH dramatically increased the formation of both codeine and morphine when used together with an NADPH-generating system, especially in liver microsomes. NADPH is essential in the formation of oripavine from thebaine and morphine from codeine, while NADH is critical in the conversion of thebaine to codeine and from oripavine to morphine. Carbon monoxide or SKF 525A inhibited the conversion, indicating a role of cytochrome P-450. These results provide evidence for the enzymatic in vitro conversion by mammalian tissues of thebaine to morphine. The pathway is similar to that which exists in plants.\r"

In the presence of scorpion venom (Leiurus) or purified alpha-scorpion toxin, the PTX-B-induced sodium influx is enhanced severalfold. PTX-B alone has no effect on sodium flux in N18 neuroblastoma cells but, in the presence of alpha-scorpion toxin, stimulation of sodium influx by PTX-B reaches levels comparable to that attained with the sodium channel activator veratridine. In neuroblastoma LV9 cells, a variant mutant that lacks sodium channels, neither veratridine nor PTX-B induces sodium fluxes in either the presence or absence of alpha-scorpion toxin. In synaptoneurosomes and in N18 cells, the sodium influx induced by the combination of PTX-B and alpha-scorpion toxin is inhibited by tetrodotoxin and local anesthetics. PTX-B does not interact with two of the known toxin sites on the sodium channel, as evidenced by a lack of effect on binding of [3H]saxitoxin or [3H]batrachotoxinin A benzoate to brain synaptoneurosomes. Synergistic effects on sodium influx with alpha-scorpion toxin, beta-scorpion toxin, and brevetoxin indicate that PTX-B does not interact directly with three other toxin sites on the sodium channel. Thus, PTX-B appears to activate sodium influx by interacting with yet another site on the voltage-dependent sodium channel, a site that is coupled allosterically to sites for alpha-scorpion toxin, beta-scorpion toxin, and brevetoxin.\r"

Separate domains on laminin elicit these responses, suggesting that distinct receptors occur on the surface of cells. NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells rapidly extend long processes in the presence of laminin. We report here that 125I-labeled laminin specifically binds to these cells and to three membrane proteins of 67, 110, and 180 kDa. These proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography on laminin-Sepharose. The 67-kDa protein reacted with antibody to the previously characterized receptor for cell attachment to laminin. Antibodies to the 110-kDa and 180-kDa bands demonstrated that the 110-kDa protein was found in a variety of epithelial cell lines and in brain, whereas the 180-kDa protein was neural specific. Antibodies prepared against the 110-kDa and 180-kDa proteins inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by the neurite-promoting domain of laminin, whereas antibodies to the 67-kDa laminin receptor had no effect on neurite outgrowth. We conclude that neuronal cells have multiple cell-surface laminin receptors and that the 110-kDa and 180-kDa proteins are involved in neurite formation.\r"

Relaxations in patch current were observed after two kinds of perturbation: (i) fast jumps of cGMP concentration, generated by laser flash photolysis of a cGMP ester (\"caged\" cGMP), and (ii) membrane voltage jumps, which perturb activation of the channel by cGMP. In both methods the speed of activation increased with the final cGMP concentration. The results are explained by a simple kinetic model in which activation involves three sequential cGMP binding steps with bimolecular rate constants close to the diffusion-controlled limit; fully liganded channels undergo rapid open-closed transitions. Voltage perturbs activation by changing the rate constant for channel closing, which increases with hyperpolarization. Intramolecular transitions of the fully liganded channel limit the kinetics of activation at high cGMP concentrations (greater than 50 microM), whereas at physiological cGMP concentrations (less than 5 microM), the kinetics of activation are limited by the third cGMP binding step. The channel appears to be optimized for rapid responses to changes in cytoplasmic cGMP concentration.\r"

The object was to investigate the representation and transformation of spatial information during the early stages of peripheral and cortical neural processing. Our method consisted of sweeping each letter of the alphabet across the skin repeatedly and constructing a two-dimensional plot (called a spatial event plot) of the action potentials evoked in afferent fibers and cortical neurons. By using this method, slowly and rapidly adapting primary afferents were shown to transmit isomorphic neural images of the letters. Although the slowly adapting images were more spatially acute, both populations conveyed images of sufficient quality to account for human psychophysical performance. In the cortical areas studied, the slowly adapting neurons of area 3b stood out for the acuity, complexity, and variety of their responses. Some of the spatial event plots for these neurons were isomorphic and at least as acute as those obtained from any primary afferent. Others were highly structured but nonisomorphic. The quality and variety of responses in area 3b slowly adapting neurons suggest that they play an important role in the processing of information underlying tactual pattern recognition. The rapidly adapting neurons of area 3b and all types of neurons in area 1 yield much less structured and differentiated responses.\r"

  ".W": "We compare the retinal rod photocurrent before and after introduction of an hydrolysis-resistant analog of GTP into the outer segment by the whole-cell patch technique. Others have shown that GTP bound to transducin leads to the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP, causing the response to light--a decrease in dark current. The hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog prolongs the response to a bright flash, which leads us to suggest that prolonged transducin activation by bright light desensitizes the rod by a prolonged decrease in dark current. Recovery from the response to a bright flash does occur after introduction of the analog; that recovery requires acceleration of cyclase activity rather than inhibition of phosphodiesterase. The analog mimics light adaptation by desensitizing the rod and speeding the recovery from a dim flash. The analog plus light or light adaptation prolongs the activities of transducin and phosphodiesterase (oligonucleate 5'-nucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.1) to mediate desensitization by reducing the dark current. Hence, this faster recovery from a dim flash would be by increased activity of guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2] rather than by inhibited phosphodiesterase. Accelerated activity of guanylate cyclase may speed recovery by response truncation. We conclude that transducin, activated by photolyzed rhodopsin, may lead to increased activity of both phosphodiesterase and guanylate cyclase to mediate the desensitization and the faster recovery of the light-adapted response.\r"

Corresponding to the experimental results on animal studies, the phosphocreatine signal is dramatically reduced in the localized spectra. Our localization strategy also allows us to shim easily on the well-defined volume of interest and leads to high-resolution spectra that exhibit multiplet structure. Our results indicate that we can obtain localized signals from deep small organs and point the way for other human metabolism studies.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme activity capable of degrading the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor of cell-surface proteins has previously been reported in a number of mammalian tissues. The experiments reported here demonstrate that this anchor-degrading activity is also abundant in mammalian plasma. The activity was inhibited by EGTA or 1,10-phenanthroline. It was capable of removing the anchor from alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and variant surface glycoprotein but had little or not activity toward phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidic acid was the only 3H-labeled product when this enzyme hydrolyzed [3H]myristate-labeled variant surface glycoprotein. It could be distinguished from the Ca2+-dependent inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C activity in several rat tissues on the basis of its molecular size and its sensitivity to 1,10-phenanthroline. The data therefore suggest that this activity is due to a phospholipase D with specificity for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol structures. Although the precise physiological function of this anchor-specific phospholipase D remains to be determined, these findings indicate that it could play an important role in regulating the expression and release of cell-surface proteins in vivo.\r"

Vector DNA containing two rightward open reading frames in the BamHI E fragment, BERF2a and BERF2b, induced the expression of a nuclear antigen identical serologically and with respect to size to the larger of the two polypeptides previously designated as EBNA4 in B95-8 cells. An antigen corresponding to the smaller polypeptide was induced in cells transfected with constructs that contained two neighboring reading frames, BERF3 and BERF4. This antigen also reacted with a rabbit antiserum to the synthetic peptide 203, deduced from BERF4. Thus, the findings show that the two components of the EBNA4 doublet in B95-8 cells are encoded by separate genes. The antigen encoded by BERF2a and/or BERF2b has been designated as EBNA4 and the antigen encoded by BERF3 and/or BERF4 has been designated as EBNA6. Polyvalent human antisera detected EBNA4 and EBNA6 in 9 of 11 lymphoid cell lines carrying independent EBV isolates. In the remaining two lines, either EBNA4 or EBNA6 was not detectable.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that is found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL). In CML, this results in the expression of a chimeric 8.5-kilobase BCR-ABL transcript that encodes the P210BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The Ph1 chromosome in ALL expresses a distinct ABL-derived 7-kilobase messenger RNA that encodes the P185ALL-ABL protein. Since the expression of different oncogene products may play a role in the distinctive presentation of Ph1-positive ALL versus CML, it is necessary to understand the molecular basis for the expression of P185ALL-ABL. Both P210BCR-ABL and P185ALL-ABL are recognized by an antiserum directed to BCR determinants in the amino-terminal region of both proteins. Antisera to BCR determinants proximal to the BCR-ABL junction in CML immunoprecipitated P210BCR-ABL but not P185ALL-ABL. Nucleotide sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones made from RNA from the Ph1-positive ALL SUP-B15 cell line, and S1 nuclease protection analysis confirmed the presence of BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts in Ph1-positive ALL cells. In Ph1-positive ALL, ABL sequences were joined to BCR sequences approximately 1.5 kilobases 5' of the CML junction. P185ALL-ABL represents the product of a BCR-ABL fusion gene in Ph1-positive ALL that is distinct from the BCR-ABL fusion gene of CML.\r"

Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), but not TGF-beta 1, was active in alpha-actin induction, while addition of fibroblast growth factor had a small synergistic effect. Medium conditioned by Xenopus XTC cells (XTC-CM), known to have powerful mesoderm-inducing activity, was shown to contain TGF-beta-like activity as measured by a radioreceptor binding assay, colony formation in NRK cells, and growth inhibition in CCL64 cells. The activity of XTC-CM in mesoderm induction and in growth inhibition of CCL64 cells was inhibited partially by antibodies to TGF-beta 2 but not by antibodies to TGF-beta 1. Thus, a TGF-beta 2-like molecule may be involved in mesoderm induction.\r"

Subsequently, we did a prospective, randomized comparative study of 53 patients with pelvic infections treated with either cefotetan (2 gm IV every 12 hours) or cefoxitin (2 gm IV every six to eight hours). Both drugs showed similar clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity (100% [n = 36] with cefotetan and 94% [n = 17] with cefoxitin, the difference not statistically significant). A mean of 21.3 gm of cefotetan was required, as compared with 34.4 gm of cefoxitin, a statistically significant difference (P less than .001). Use of cefotetan is therefore more cost effective.\r"

High-resolution cytogenetic analysis was normal, and the result could not be explained on the basis of nonpaternity or a submicroscopic deletion. All of the data indicate that the propositus inherited two identical copies of maternal sequences for much or all of chromosome 7. The occurrence of uniparental disomy could be explained by models postulating postfertilization error, gamete complementation, monosomic conception with subsequent chromosome gain, or trisomic conception followed by chromosome loss. Uniparental disomy in an individual with a normal chromosome analysis is a novel mechanism for the occurrence of human genetic disease.\r"

A decreasing gradient in the estimated recombination fractions observed when the markers were ordered on the basis of their map locations suggested that the disease locus is on the long arm distal to all the markers typed in this study. Using three-locus analysis we rejected all but three map orders for the six loci (the disease locus and five markers). In all three the Alport syndrome locus was on the long arm of the X chromosome distal to all the markers. Two types of Alport syndrome were represented in the three kindreds. Affected males in one kindred developed deafness in addition to nephritis; deafness did not occur in members of the other two kindreds. Although larger recombination-fraction estimates were obtained for all five markers in the kindreds without deafness, the difference was significant for only one marker. Evidence of heterogeneity was not found in tests using two markers. Markers distal to the disease locus are needed to determine whether two loci are responsible for the two types of Alport syndrome.\r"

It is distinguished from the other polyposis syndromes by its delayed age at onset, the number of polyps, and its extracolonic manifestations. The presence of epidermal cysts, bony osteomata, desmoid tumors, and dental anomalies are distinguishing features of this syndrome. Recently, multiple and bilateral patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) have been described in three families with classical GS. Tight linkage of the GS and CHRPE phenotypes (Z = 9.752; theta = 0) suggested that CHRPE is a pleiotropic effect of the Gardner mutation within the families in which the ophthalmic trait occurs and is thus a useful marker for the early detection of GS gene carriers. We have analyzed six new families segregating for classic GS and CHRPE. Linkage was tested between GS and CHRPE and between these two phenotypes and a battery of 22 informative biochemical and serological markers. We have extended the linkage analysis on two GS-CHRPE families originally reported elsewhere. Linkage between GS and CHRPE at theta = 0 was observed in all families, a result supporting our original suggestion that CHRPE is a congenital manifestation of the GS mutation. Exclusionary linkage data presented confirm that, for linkage analysis in these families, the CHRPE phenotype is a more powerful marker than other phenotypic features of GS.\r"

The first RFLPs at the loci for SIS, IGLV, and MB are described. The most likely gene order on the basis of multilocus analysis was cen-(IGLV-IGLC)-D22S1-MB-SIS. This map provides further evidence for localization of the P1 polymorphism of the P blood group to chromosome 22, close to the SIS locus. Analysis of families segregating recessive congenital methemoglobinemia (RCM), a disease in which the cytochrome b5 reductase is defective, as well as of families with cases of hereditary low levels of cytochrome b5 reductase activity, confirmed that the locus responsible for RCM is on chromosome 22. Biochemical studies had already suggested that mutation at the cytochrome b5 reductase locus (DIA1) is responsible for RCM. We found no evidence of genetic heterogeneity between the families segregating RCM and the families exhibiting cases of low cytochrome b5 reductase activity. Linkage analysis indicated that the most probable location of DIA1 lies between MB and SIS.\r"

By substituting identity-by-state relations for identity-by-descent relations, we develop a test statistic for detecting departures from independent segregation of disease and marker phenotypes. The statistic is based on the marker phenotypes of affected pedigree members only. Since it is more striking for distantly affected relatives to share a rare marker allele than a common marker allele, the statistic also includes a weighting factor based on allele frequency. The distributional properties of the statistic are investigated theoretically and by simulation. Part of the theoretical treatment entails generalizing Karigl's multiple-person kinship coefficients. When the test statistic is applied to pedigree data on Huntington disease, the null hypothesis of independent segregation between the marker locus and the disease locus is firmly rejected. In this case, as expected, there is a loss of power when compared with standard lod-score analysis. However, our statistic possesses the advantage of requiring no explicit assumptions about the mode of inheritance of the disease. This point is illustrated by application of the test statistic to data on rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized and genetically mapped new polymorphic DNA markers in the q27-q28 region of the X chromosome. New informative RFLPs have been found for DXS105, DXS115, and DXS152. In particular, heterozygosity at the DXS105 locus has been increased from 25% to 52%. We have shown that DXS105 and DXS152 are contained within a 40-kb region. A multipoint linkage analysis was performed in fragile-X families and in large normal families from the Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH). This has allowed us to establish the order centromere-DXS144-DXS51-DXS102-F9-DXS105-FRAX A-(F8, DXS15, DXS52, DXS115). DXS102 is close to the hemophilia-B locus (z[theta] = 13.6 at theta = .02) and might thus be used as an alternative probe for diagnosis in Hemophila-B families not informative for intragenic RFLPs. DXS105 is 8% recombination closer to the fragile-X locus than F9 (z[theta] = 14.6 at theta = .08 for the F9-DXS105 linkage) and should thus be a better marker for analysis of fragile-X families. However, the DXS105 locus appears to be still loosely linked to the fragile-X locus in some families. The multipoint estimation for recombination between DXS105 and FRAXA is .16 in our set of data. Our data indicate that the region responsible for the heterogeneity in recombination between F9 and the fragile-X locus is within the DXS105-FRAXA interval.\r"

Four strains of mice differing in resistance to in vivo L. donovani infection were studied. Normal macrophages from all strains converted 20:4 to prostanoids and this was augmented by L. donovani infection. Although cells from each strain synthesized elevated levels of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), there were differences with respect to relative increases of this product, with infected macrophages from the C3H/HeJ strain showing the smallest increase above basal levels. These results indicate that macrophages from mouse strains with distinct levels of in vivo resistance to L. donovani all respond to infection with augmented prostanoid synthesis. Although some heterogeneity in strain-specific PGE2 responses to in vitro infection were observed (with respect to increases in PGE2 synthesis above basal levels), it is unlikely that differential resistance of these strains to in vivo infection is strictly related to these relative differences. It seems likely that other genetically controlled factors may have a major impact on disease expression.\r"

The plasma and brain amino acid profiles were also greatly altered in these rats, characterized by increased brain concentrations of glutamine and large neutral amino acids. Analysis of regional neurotransmitter and metabolite levels by high-performance liquid chromatography suggested increases in the neuronal activity of dopamine and serotonin in each brain region examined. Surgical removal of the tumors in another group of anorectic tumor-bearing rats was followed by the return of normal feeding within 6 days. Associated with the normalization of food intake was the reversal of these biochemical aberrations in blood and brain. It is hypothesized that the utilization of glutamine and excretion of ammonia by tumor tissue is the precursor of these alterations in brain amino acids and neurotransmitters, which may be causing anorexia.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin inhibits hormone secretion from gastrointestinal endocrine tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SMS 201-995, a long-acting analog, would inhibit the growth of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Two human pancreatic cancers grown in nude mice were studied: SKI, which has cholecystokinin receptors, and CAV, which does not. Tumors were implanted in groups of six mice each. Treatment groups received SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms/kg three times daily) by intraperitoneal injections and control animals received saline solution. Tumor area was measured twice weekly. After 7 weeks, the tumors and mouse pancreases were excised, weighed, and analyzed for protein and RNA and DNA content. In a second set of experiments, treatment was begun 21 days after transplantation. Mean body weights between groups were not different in any experiment. With treatment beginning on the day of transplantation, the tumor areas of SKI and CAV cancers were reduced by the third and fifth weeks of treatment, respectively. Tumor doubling times were prolonged with treatment in both SKI tumors (5 days) and CAV tumors (6 days). In the SKI treatment groups, tumor weight (52 percent), RNA content (72 percent), and DNA content (60 percent) were decreased at sacrifice compared with those of the control groups. In the CAV treatment group, the mean tumor weight (55 percent) and protein (48 percent), RNA (67 percent) and DNA contents (60 percent) were decreased compared with the CAV control group. Tumor growth of SKI and CAV cancers was also inhibited when treatment was delayed 21 days after transplantation. We conclude that these effects are not mediated by inhibition of cholecystokinin, as seen by similar inhibitory effects on both tumors. Treatment with SMS 201-995 may be an effective hormonal therapy in patients with pancreatic cancers.\r"

Patients included four men and one woman who ranged in age from 52 to 77 years. The fistulas developed after drainage of a pancreatic abscess, biopsy of a pancreatic mass, splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Felty's syndrome, and operative trauma, respectively. Fistula output consisted of 1,000 ml/day of amylase- and lipase-rich fluid in the patient with a pancreatic biopsy. The other four patients had low-output fistulas (100 to 250 ml/day) that had been draining for 1 to 12 months. Direct communication with the pancreatic duct was demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, sinography, or both in four of the five patients. Fistula output decreased from 340 +/- 376 ml/day to 63 +/- 36 ml/day on the first day of therapy with two daily doses of 0.05 mg SMS 201-995 (p less than 0.03) and to 13 +/- 19 ml/day on the seventh day of therapy (p less than 0.03). Two patients had prompt closure of their fistulas and one closed in 3 months. One patient with chronic pancreatitis and a duct stricture and one patient with recurring infection did not achieve permanent fistula closure with SMS 201-995. Because of its safety, ease of administration, and efficacy in decreasing fistula output, we believe somatostatin analog therapy is beneficial in hastening closure of pancreatic fistulas.\r"

The right lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2, while the left lung was either ventilated with 100% O2 (\"hyperoxia\") or ventilated with an hypoxic gas mixture (\"hypoxia:\" end-tidal PO2 approximately equal to 50.0 +/- 0.1 mmHg). Cardiac output (CO) was altered from a \"normal\" value of 2.89 +/- 0.26 1.min-1 to a \"high\" value of 3.55 +/- 0.26 1.min-1 by opening arteriovenous fistulae which allowed measurements of two points along a pressure-flow line. These four phases of left lung hypoxia or hyperoxia with normal and high cardiac output were performed in the absence of, and in the presence of, PGF2 alpha administered as a constant peripheral intravenous infusion of 1.0 microgram.kg-1.min-1. During left lung hypoxia, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increased significantly when compared to hyperoxia. With PGF2 alpha administration, mean PAP increased significantly during both hyperoxia and hypoxia. The presence or absence of PGF2 alpha had no effect on cardiac output or PaO2 during hypoxia. Relative blood flow to each lung was measured with a differential CO2 excretion (VCO2) method corrected for the Haldane effect. With both lungs hyperoxic, the percent left lung blood flow (%QL-VCO2) was 45 +/- 1%. When the left lung was exposed to hypoxia, the %QL-VCO2 decreased significantly to 29 +/- 3%. However, with the administration of PGF2 alpha, the %QL-VCO2 during left lung hypoxia did not change significantly 26 +/- 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated the effects of phosphoramidon, an enkephalinase inhibitor, on the increases in lung resistance (RL) caused by exogenous substance P and inhaled capsaicin (an agent thought to provoke bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs by stimulating the release of tachykinins from afferent nerve endings). In 6 of 6 animals, phosphoramidon potentiated the substance P-induced increase in RL (RL increased 380 +/- 100% [mean +/- SEM] before phosphoramidon and 1,300 +/- 400% afterward, p less than 0.025). In 4 of 4 animals, the repeated administration of a single dose of substance P after saline did not result in potentiation of the increase in RL caused by substance P. Similarly, in 6 animals exposed to inhaled capsaicin, phosphoramidon significantly increased capsaicin responsiveness when compared to 6 capsaicin-exposed animals not treated with phosphoramidon. Phosphoramidon-induced augmentation of the airway responsiveness to substance P and to capsaicin was not simply the result of a nonspecific increase in airway smooth muscle responsiveness because phosphoramidon failed to potentiate the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled acetylcholine. These results suggest the enkephalinase plays an important role in modulating in vivo bronchoconstrictor responses to substance P in guinea pigs. Therefore, alterations in enkephalinase activity could contribute to in vivo alterations in bronchoconstrictor responsiveness.\r"

Mean corpuscular volume increased markedly in patients on zidovudine therapy not developing anemia yet remained stable or only slightly increased in those who became anemic. Bone marrow examination showed pure red cell aplasia in 2 patients, erythroid maturation arrest in 1, and erythroid hypoplasia in 3. Megaloblastic erythropoiesis was present in 2 of the 6 anemic patients. Erythropoietin levels measured at the time of first transfusion were increased. Thus, the anemia associated with zidovudine therapy is due to red cell hypoplasia or aplasia.\r"

Based on results of prior research, the evaluations included the postethanol changes in subjective feelings, levels of body sway or static ataxia, and plasma levels of prolactin and cortisol. A stepwise discriminant function analysis on the sample of 60 men revealed that four items (maximum terrible subjective feelings after high dose, cortisol values at two time points after high dose, and prolactin results after low dose) combined to correctly identify 83% of the controls and 70% of the sons of alcoholics. This included approximately 40% of each group whose discriminant scores were +1 or -1 and who were considered to be solidly classified. These results were relatively robust on a jackknife validation procedure. Results of a search for independent factors in the cluster of test scores after ethanol using a principal components analysis were consistent with the discriminant analysis, indicating the possibility of three overlapping domains of the ethanol response, including subjective feelings after the high-dose ethanol challenge (explaining 46% of the variance), hormonal changes after high-dose ethanol along with body sway items (14% of variance), and prolactin changes after low-dose ethanol (9% of variance). There were few background differences between men who had been properly and improperly classified.\r"

Monocyte plasminogen activator production was markedly depressed and inversely correlated to patients' monocyte hyper PGE2 production. Levels of the PGE2-producing monocyte subset (selected as high-affinity Fc+ receptors) were progressively elevated after injury in immunosuppressed patients, reaching 65% to 80% of the total monocyte population (39% for normal controls). Although early T-suppressor (Ts) lymphocytes did not augment monocyte PGE2 secretion, Ts lymphocytes that appeared late (greater than 12 days after injury), during chronic infection, acted as monocyte PGE2 secretagogues. Posttraumatic increases in monocyte sensitivity to PGE2 secretagogues augmented the numbers of PGE2-secreting monocytes, and the appearance of Ts lymphocytes with PGE2 secretagogue activity may be responsible for elevated monocyte PGE2 production in immunosuppressed trauma patients.\r"

Elevation of platelet counts after splenectomy in patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia is most likely to occur in women with the primary form of the disease.

  ".W": "In order to compare the efficacy of permucosal needle drainage with that of incision and drainage in the outpatient management of peritonsillar abscess, 52 patients with aspiration-proven peritonsillar abscess were entered into a randomized, prospective protocol. A symptomatic scale scoring system was employed to evaluate treatment results. In the needle drainage group, 92% (22/24) were cured with a single aspiration. Ninety-three percent (26/28) of the patients in the incision and drainage group were cured on the initial attempt. The remainder of the patients in both groups were cured with a single retreatment. Only one patient required hospitalization, and no patients required tonsillectomy to resolve the abscess. These data indicate that outpatient permucosal needle drainage of peritonsillar abscess is an acceptable, inexpensive treatment comparing favorably with incision and drainage.\r"

  ".W": "A study has been carried out on the actions of the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and their synthesis inhibitors, indomethacin and diclofenac sodium, upon isolated human ureteric smooth muscle, using the technique of microsuperfusion designed to ensure good tissue viability. Indomethacin and diclofenac sodium were shown to abolish almost completely the contractile response of ureteric muscle to electrical field stimulation. Contractile activity, in the presence of the inhibitors, could be restored by prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha or by increasing the external potassium concentration, [K+]O, of the superfusate. Prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha alone were shown to increase dramatically both the phasic and tonic component of the electrically stimulated contractions, on occasions inducing spontaneous activity. A possible mechanism of action was elucidated with an electrophysiological technique using intracellular microelectrodes. The mean membrane potential recorded was 54.7 mV (SD +/- 10 mV, n = 15). The depolarising action of raising [K+]O was demonstrated and prostaglandin F2 alpha (3 x 10(-6) M) was shown to produce a small depolarisation of the ureteric muscle cell membrane.\r"

A painful swelling appeared in the proximal portion of his right tibia, which was diagnosed as osteogenic sarcoma on biopsy study. The patient died of massive pulmonary metastases and cachexia four months after the onset of the tumor. Osteogenic sarcoma in a patient with EBDH seems not to have been previously reported. EBDH has been known to be occasionally associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Whether an impairment of the patient's defense mechanism by the chronic skin disease might have enhanced the rapid progression of the associated bone malignancy is unknown.\r"

During this time there were 15 endotracheal tube (ETT) occlusions in 15 patients. Over the ensuing 4 months, cascade humidification was used for 81 patients and only one ETT occlusion occurred (p less than .01). The HMEs were replaced frequently with cascade humidifiers during the evaluation period because of inadequate airway humidification. The increase in ETT occlusion was associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia (p less than .001) and atelectasis (p less than .01). Most patients with ETT occlusion required minute volumes greater than 10 L and F10(2) greater than 0.4. We conclude that HMEs do not provide sufficient airway humidification for generalized ICU use. Their role outside of the operating room remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "This paper investigates acid disposal by gastric and duodenal mucosa with particular reference to the mechanisms of acid-stimulated luminal alkalinization in the duodenum. The bulk of solute flux across duodenal epithelium occurs by paracellular permeation, and passive diffusion of HCO3 via shunt pathways contributes substantially to luminal alkalinization by this tissue in vitro. Effects on epithelial permeability of two treatments which stimulate mucosal alkaline secretion (PGE2 and low luminal pH) were studied in vivo by measuring transmucosal fluxes of radiolabeled urea (mol wt 76) and inulin (mol wt approximately 5000). Rats were anesthetized and rates of alkalinization in segments of distal duodenum perfused with saline were monitored by continuous titration. PGE2 (10 microM, topically) increased alkaline secretion from 1.63 +/- 0.34 to 3.07 +/- 0.54 microeq/cm/hr (mean +/- SEM, N = 5). Luminal acid exposure (10 mM HCl for 10 min) increased alkalinization rate from 1.54 +/- 0.43 to 2.69 +/- 0.76; subsequent addition of PGE2 induced a further rise to 3.27 +/- 0.54. Recovery of inulin in the luminal perfusate following intravenous injection was less than 10% of that of urea. Topical PGE2 had little or no effect on recovery of either marker. Luminal acidification increased the rate of appearance of urea by 130 +/- 30% (P less than 0.01, N = 6); recovery of inulin rose slightly but did not achieve statistical significance compared with control. Thus stimulation of mucosal alkaline secretion by luminal PGE2 or acid are associated with differential effects on mucosal permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88137155\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that inhibits the intracellular translocation of newly synthesized glycoproteins, on the biosynthesis of TSH and free alpha-subunits by pituitary tissue from hypothyroid mice. Incubation of tissue with 5 or 10 micrograms BFA/ml for 3.5 h caused marked dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and mild swelling of Golgi in all pituitary cell types. As judged by incorporation of [35S]Met into acid-insoluble radioactivity, BFA at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml did not substantially inhibit protein synthesis, but markedly reduced protein secretion. After a 2-h pulse with [35S]Met, followed by a 4-h chase, BFA at 5 micrograms/ml reduced the release of TSH and free alpha-subunits into the medium by 94% and 99%, respectively; subunits that accumulated within cells were forms with mol wt 2000-4000 less than normal. BFA also partially inhibited the release into the medium of TSH or free alpha-subunits labeled with [3H]fucose or [35S]SO4, but this effect was less marked than that for [35S]Met-labeled subunits. Both the morphological and the isotopic data suggest that BFA blocks transport of secretory proteins between rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of pituitary cells, although transport within the Golgi may also be affected to some extent.\r"

Apparent peritoneal fluid values were found to be 10-fold higher than serum levels, with no difference between the study groups (130 versus 106 U/ml, respectively). However, when peritoneal fluid was diluted to validate the assay system in peritoneal fluid, no sample of peritoneal fluid showed decreased binding with serial dilutions of 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10. At a dilution of 1:100, there was some decreased binding, but the level was 17-fold higher than expected. The source of this interference is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated kidneys of Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) excrete sodium less readily than those of Dahl salt-resistant rats (DR). The collecting tubule is an important source of papillary prostaglandin E2 and is a site of significant sodium reabsorption. We cultured renal papillary collecting tubule cells from 5-week-old, prehypertensive DS and DR on a low salt diet and also after 14 weeks of high salt feeding, and we measured prostaglandin E2 synthetic capacity. Unstimulated renal papillary collecting tubule cells from 5-week-old DS produced 62 +/- 5% less prostaglandin E2 than did comparable cells from DR (p less than 0.001). The cells from DS also synthesized less prostaglandin E2 after stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 (67 +/- 6% of control; p less than 0.001) or the addition of exogenous arachidonate (74 +/- 7% of control; p less than 0.01). Urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion was also diminished in the 5-week-old DS compared with their salt-resistant counterparts (18.1 +/- 1.3 vs 23.9 +/- 1.7 ng/24 hr; p less than 0.025). After high salt feeding, the DS became hypertensive but the DR remained normotensive. Renal papillary collecting tubule cells cultured from these DS continued to produce less prostaglandin E2 than those from control rats, both in the basal state (60 +/- 12% of control; p less than 0.09) and after stimulation with ionophore (62 +/- 2% of control; p less than 0.002). In these older animals, the DS continued to underexcrete prostaglandin E2 compared with the DR (29.7 +/- 3.2 vs 42.2 +/- 6.1 ng/24 hr; p less than 0.08). The underproduction of prostaglandin E2 in the papillary collecting tubule of DS may play a role in their inadequate renal natriuretic capacity and contribute to the onset and maintenance of salt-induced hypertension in this strain.\r"

  ".U": "88139771\r", 
  ".W": "By employing early-passaged rabbit kidney epithelial cells in tissue culture, we demonstrated that angiotensin II (AII) has unique mechanisms of signal transduction. First, unlike its action in other target tissues, micromolar concentrations of AII are required to induce small rises in cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i, an action which is not accompanied by the release of inositol phosphates (IP). In contrast, nanomolar bradykinin (BK) mobilizes [Ca2+]i through activation of phospholipase C and release of IP. Neither of these stimulated calcium responses exhibits pertussis toxin (PTx) sensitivity. Secondly, AII and BK at 10(-9) to 10(-7) M stimulate cAMP indirectly through PGE2 production in distal cells. AII- and BK-stimulated PGE2 release is PTx inhibitible, suggestive of the presence of a GTP binding protein mediating the response. By contrast, arginine vasopressin fails to elicit rises in [Ca2+]i but exerts its primary effect on cAMP production in distal cells via direct coupling to a stimulatory GTP binding protein, as evidenced by uncoupling with cholera toxin. Regulation of PGE2 synthesis appears to occur via phospholipase A2, not C, by all three peptides.\r"
