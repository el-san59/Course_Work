  ".W": "A 74-year-old man developed neutropenia in association with Sjogren's syndrome. The peripheral neutrophils in his blood decreased to 210/mm3 (total white blood cell count 2,100/mm3). Bone marrow examination showed an increase in the number of neutrophil precursors. The presence of anti-neutrophil autoantibody (ANAB) in his plasma was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prednisolone therapy resulted in an increase in the neutrophil count and a decrease in the ANAB titer. However, when the daily dose of prednisolone was decreased, the neutrophil count gradually decreased, and the ANAB titer increased again. These results suggest that neutropenia in this patient was caused by ANAB, and ANAB could be the result of autoimmune disorders associated with Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of neutralizing exercise systemic acidosis via the intravenous route upon endurance and metabolic responses, eight lean, normal, postabsorptive men exercised to exhaustion at about 80% of their VO2 max (69 +/- 3%, mean +/- SEM, of maximum power output) on a cycle ergometer. Exercise studies were performed either with no infusion (control) or with a total infusion volume of about 1.5 L, mainly as 1.3% sodium bicarbonate or as 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), infused (double-blind) throughout exercise. The sodium bicarbonate was to prevent acid-base change, the sodium chloride was as a control for the volume infused. Arterialized venous blood and breath-by-breath analysis of expired gases were obtained. [H+] (nmol.L-1) and [HCO3-] (mmol.L-1) at exhaustion were similar in control and NaCl (46.5 +/- 1.8, 19.9 +/- 0.9), but remained unchanged from rest values with bicarbonate (38.4 +/- 0.9, 24.8 +/- 1.5, p less than 0.005 vs control and NaCl). At exhaustion, VO2, VCO2, RER, heart rate, and systolic BP as well as FFA, glycerol, alanine, insulin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine did not differ among protocols. Endurance was markedly prolonged (p less than 0.01) with bicarbonate (31.9 +/- 5.8 min) and NaCl (31.8 +/- 4.1 min) compared with the control (19.0 +/- 2.9 min) condition. Plasma glucose at exhaustion was higher (p less than 0.025) in the control compared to bicarbonate and NaCl experiments, while lactate was higher (p less than 0.025) in the bicarbonate than in the control and NaCl experiments. Thus, the prolonged endurance with sodium bicarbonate infusion could not be explained either by its effect of maintaining blood acid-base equilibrium or concomitant metabolic changes.\r"

No intraoperative deaths occurred among the 415 patients treated surgically, but there were 17 deaths (4%) within 28 days of operation. The absolute 5-year survival rate was 85% in patients with negative inguinofemoral lymph nodes and 39% when these lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.

Post partum the patient had numerous episodes of severe hypoglycemia in spite of constant intravenous glucose. Computerized tomographic scan of the pancreas failed to show a lesion, whereas pancreatic arteriography revealed a 2 cm mass in the tail of the pancreas. Partial pancreatectomy was performed 6 days after delivery. Microscopic examination of the tissue confirmed the presence of an insulinoma. Hypercalcemia developed together with elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The presence of an insulinoma, hypercalcemia, and a history of hyperparathyroidism in two relatives indicates that this is a case of multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I first diagnosed during pregnancy.\r"

The sensitivities for the detection of primary corpus cancer and hyperplasia were 0.90 (59/66) and 0.58 (18/31), respectively. All six cases of atypical endometrial hyperplasia were detected by the EndoPap device. Malignant EndoPap cytologic findings were present in 4 of 10 patients with a primary adnexal malignancy and normal endometrial histologic findings. Ninety-two percent of primary uterine cervical cancers were detected by EndoPap cytologic sampling. The specificity for the cytologic diagnosis of benign conditions was 0.93. EndoPap cytologic sampling has a reasonably high sensitivity for the detection of uterine cancers and preinvasive endometrial lesions with a high risk of progression to carcinoma. Further evaluation as to its usefulness in a screening program for uterine and adnexal cancers in postmenopausal women should be considered.\r"

Although this approach improved perinatal results for these women and their infants, it is costly and cumbersome. The 3-year experience of an outpatient diabetic obstetric clinic is compared with the results obtained at the same facility during 5 previous years when hospitalization was used more extensively. Perinatal mortality and morbidity were not different in 51 type I diabetic women managed almost entirely as outpatients when compared with 58 similarly complicated diabetic patients receiving more conventional management. Mean prenatal admissions (1 vs 2, p = less than 0.01), mean prenatal hospital days (6 vs 12, p = 0.05), and prolonged delivery admissions of greater than 7 days (31% vs 69%, p = less than 0.01) were significantly less.

  ".U": "90386197\r", 
  ".W": "A department-wide effort to reduce the cesarean section rate at the University Medical Center of Jacksonville (Florida) began in 1987. University Medical Center, a teaching hospital with approximately 4500 annual deliveries, serves an almost exclusively indigent obstetric population. Overall, the cesarean section rate declined from 28 per 100 deliveries in 1986 to 11 per 100 in 1989. Decreasing the number of repeat cesarean sections played an important role in reducing total cesarean deliveries. In 1986 32% of women with prior cesarean sections underwent a trial of labor. By 1989 this proportion had increased to 84%. In 1986 65% of women undergoing a trial of labor were delivered vaginally. By 1989 this proportion had increased to 83%. For these reasons the proportion of patients who had repeat cesarean sections dropped from 8% in 1986 to 3% in 1989. Changing approaches to the evaluation and management of dystocia and fetal distress also helped to lower the overall cesarean section rate. In 1986 cesarean sections for at least one of these two indications accounted for 14% of all deliveries. By 1989 this percentage had dropped to 4%. Because selective criteria for vaginal delivery of fetuses in breech presentation were maintained, incremental increased rates of vaginal breech delivery had only a minimal impact on lower overall cesarean section rates. The reduction in the number of cesarean sections was accomplished without compromising neonatal outcomes. In fact, during this 4-year period neonatal mortality rates actually decreased; neonatal morbidity rates remained stable. Our experience suggests that cesarean section rates can be substantially reduced without compromising the newborn.\r"

  ".W": "To assess placental metabolism of cocaine, placentas were obtained at the time of delivery and the microsomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation within 2 hours. Placental microsomes were cultured with cocaine at physiologic plasma concentrations similar to those of cocaine users (0.75 micrograms/ml). Two control groups were established. In the first group an anticholinesterase was added to the culture to suppress enzyme activity, and in the second cocaine was cultured alone without placental microsomes to obtain baseline spontaneous conversion of the drug. The results indicate that cocaine is biotransformed by the human placenta, presumably by cholinesterase activity. This suggests that the placenta may provide a moderate degree of protection from cocaine-induced morbidity, such as abruptio placentae and fetal growth retardation, by converting cocaine into less active metabolites. These results also have pharmacogenetic implications because cholinesterase activity varies among individuals. Hence placentas that cannot transform the drug may place the conceptus at greater risk of developmental abnormalities.\r"

  ".U": "90386226\r", 
  ".W": "Approximately one third of infants born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 seropositive mothers have evidence of infection or of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by the age of 18 months. One fifth of infected infants also have died by age 18 months. This prevalence, combined with the demonstration that zidovudine (formerly azidothymidine) can decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--related complex, may lead to increasing use of azidothymidine in pregnancy despite a paucity of information regarding its pharmacokinetics. To further investigate the distribution of azidothymidine and its inactive metabolite 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine in the mother, fetus, and amniotic fluid, 12 near-term pregnant baboons were given oral azidothymidine (21 mg/kg/day in four divided doses every 6 hours, equivalent to the usual nonpregnant human dose of 1500 mg/day). Specimens of maternal blood, fetal arterial blood obtained by percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling, and amniotic fluid were obtained after from one to 17 doses of azidothymidine. Azidothymidine levels were measured by radioimmunoassay with the INCSTAR commercial radioimmunoassay kit and using Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase for determination of 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine levels. Paired analyses revealed significant concentration gradients between amniotic fluid, fetal serum, and maternal serum for both azidothymidine (p less than 0.019) and 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine (p less than 0.002). The amniotic fluid 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine level increased with increasing doses of azidothymidine despite the fact that the maternal azidothymidine and 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine concentrations were unchanged. This accumulation of amniotic fluid 5'-glucuronide azidothymidine may provide a functional drug reservoir and contribute to the higher fetal concentrations of the medication and its metabolite. Alternatively, the higher fetal levels may represent slower clearance in the fetus than in the mother. Further studies appear warranted with respect to possible adverse fetal effects, especially bone marrow suppression with prolonged and chronic exposure to azidothymidine.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred nine patients with severe preeclampsia in the second trimester were studied. Pregnancy termination was recommended for those with gestational age less than or equal to 24 weeks (n = 25), whereas expectant management with aggressive maternal and fetal monitoring was recommended for those with gestational age greater than 24 but less than or equal to 27 weeks (n = 84). Ten of the 25 women in the early pregnancy group accepted termination and 15 elected to continue the pregnancy. The overall perinatal survival in the latter 15 patients was 6.7%, and maternal complications developed in six patients. Thirty of the 84 patients in the late second-trimester group had immediate delivery, and 54 had expectant management. The average length of pregnancy prolongation in the expectant group was 13.2 days (range, 4 to 28 days). Compared with the immediate delivery group, the expectant management group had significantly higher perinatal survival (76.4% versus 35%), significantly higher birth weights (880 versus 709 gm), and a lower incidence of neonatal complications. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to maternal complications. Expectant management with aggressive monitoring of maternal and fetal status at a perinatal center improves perinatal outcome in patients with severe preeclampsia with gestational age greater than 24 but less than or equal to 27 weeks.\r"

Amniocenteses were performed on both sacs of 46 women with twin gestations, preterm labor, and intact membranes. Indigo carmine was injected to ensure sampling of both amniotic sacs. Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A positive amniotic fluid culture of at least one sac was noted in 10.8% (5/46) of patients admitted in preterm labor and in 11.9% (5/42) of women delivered of preterm neonates. Of the five patients with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, three had microorganisms isolated from both sacs. The presenting sac was involved in all cases, supporting an ascending route for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in twin gestation. Polymicrobial infection was found in three of the eight amniotic sacs with positive cultures. In two cases different organisms were isolated from each sac. All patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures were delivered of preterm infants within 48 hours of amniocentesis. Patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures presented with preterm labor at an earlier gestational age and with more advanced cervical dilatation than did women with negative amniotic fluid cultures. Clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in two of five women with positive amniotic fluid cultures. The interval between amniocentesis and delivery was shorter in women with positive amniotic fluid cultures than in women with negative amniotic fluid cultures (median: 3.5 vs 168 hours, p less than 0.0001). Infants born to women with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity had a lower median birth weight and a higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome than those born to women with negative amniotic fluid cultures (birth weight: 1085 vs 1975 gm, p = 0.024; respiratory distress syndrome: 37.5% vs 8.3%, p = 0.04).\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate mode of delivery at level III institutions with access to complete care to determine if cesarean section improved outcome. One hundred eight infants were treated in the study period for abdominal wall defects. Fifty-six infants met all criteria for admission to the study. No difference in neonatal morbidity or mortality was identified. No difference was found in infants who were born by elective cesarean section compared with infants delivered after labor ensued. In conclusion, we found no evidence that cesarean section or avoidance of labor improved outcome in fetuses with uncomplicated abdominal wall defects.\r"

Ten Rh-negative unsensitized women were given 300 micrograms of Rh immune globulin at 28 weeks and blood samples were drawn at weekly intervals until delivery. Sera were titrated with Ror red blood cells in a saline solution-antiglobulin method. Titers ranged from 1 to 4 by the first week after injection. In nine of 10 patients the titers were zero at 49 to 70 days after injection. With R2R2 red blood cells and LISS, papain, polybrene, or a combination of methods, Rh immune globulin could still be detected until delivery in four of the nine patients. Because these serologic methods can detect 5 ng/ml anti-D, five of 10 subjects may not have been protected for 8 to 29 days before delivery. This study indicates that a titer of less than or equal to 4 is expected for passively acquired anti-D during pregnancy, and that antepartum administration of Rh immune globulin may not always produce detectable passive antibody for as long as theoretically predicted.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether magnesium sulfate and promethazine interact to cause hypotension in gravid ewes. Fifteen experiments were performed in five chronically instrumented animals between 125 and 130 days of timed gestation (term = 145 days). In one group of experiments each animal received magnesium sulfate (4 gm intravenous bolus followed by 4 gm/hr intravenous infusion) then promethazine (50 mg intravenously). In a second group each animal received magnesium sulfate then saline solution as a control. In a third group each animal received saline solution then promethazine. Infusion of magnesium sulfate increased the mean (+/- SEM) serum magnesium concentration to 5.7 +/- 0.6 and 6.6 +/- 0.6 mg/dl in the magnesium sulfate-promethazine and magnesium sulfate-saline solution groups, respectively. Magnesium sulfate slightly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) and increased cardiac output (p less than 0.05) in both the magnesium sulfate-promethazine and magnesium sulfate-saline solution groups. Otherwise there were no significant changes in maternal mean arterial pressure or cardiac output in any group. Promethazine increased maternal heart rate (p = 0.0001) in both the magnesium sulfate-promethazine and saline solution-promethazine groups. Magnesium sulfate increased uterine blood flow (p less than 0.01) in both the magnesium sulfate-promethazine and magnesium sulfate-saline solution groups, but promethazine blunted the increase in uterine blood flow associated with magnesium sulfate. Similarly, magnesium sulfate decreased uterine vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) in both the magnesium sulfate-promethazine and magnesium sulfate-saline solution groups, but promethazine eliminated the decrease in uterine vascular resistance associated with magnesium sulfate. Maternal and fetal arterial blood gas and acid-base values did not change in any group, except that there was a small, near-significant decrease (p = 0.06) in fetal pH 10 minutes after promethazine was given in the magnesium sulfate-promethazine group. We conclude that magnesium sulfate and promethazine did not interact to cause maternal hypotension in normovolemic gravid ewes. However, promethazine increased maternal heart rate and blunted the increase in uterine blood flow associated with magnesium sulfate.\r"

The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe our combined experience with this undesired effect by use of three techniques for prostaglandin E2 administration. Uterine hyperstimulation was present if the contraction frequency was more than five in 10 minutes or if contractions exceeded 2 minutes in duration. A total of 181 cases were evaluated during a 51-month period. The rates of hyperstimulation were 7.3% (167/2297) in the group that received intravaginal tablets (3.0 mg), 2.9% (12/408) with intravaginal gel (2.5 mg), and 0.5% (2/394) with intracervical gel (0.5 mg). Hyperstimulation usually began within the first hour for the group that used gel and within the first 4 hours for the tablet group. A beta 2-adrenergic drug (hexoprenaline or terbutaline) was infused routinely without adverse effects and with rapid resolution of the worrisome findings in 178 (98.3%) cases. The remaining three cases required cesarean delivery and had no evidence of neonatal compromise. We conclude from this large, combined series that uterine hyperstimulation after low-dose prostaglandin E2 therapy is uncommon and usually rapidly reversible with beta 2-adrenergic therapy without apparent untoward effects.\r"

Use of epidural analgesia for vaginal delivery was associated with significantly longer labor, lower umbilical arterial pH, higher arterial PCO2 and arterial bicarbonate values. In women who had cesarean section in the active phase of labor, use of epidural anesthesia was associated with significantly lower arterial and venous PO2 values when compared with women who received general anesthesia. Patients who had elective cesarean section with epidural anesthesia had funic acid-base values similar to women who had general anesthesia.

Little is reported about the real or potential risks of this procedure to both the mother and fetus. Over the past 2 years we observed several isolated cases of increased uterine activity by palpation coupled with fetal distress during amnioinfusion. These instances prompted us to study in a systematic fashion the relationships between uterine tone and activity during intrapartum amnioinfusion. We measured uterine tone and quantitated uterine activity in 10 patients undergoing intrapartum amnioinfusion and compared values 20 minutes before, during, and 20 minutes after amnioinfusion. A significant increase in uterine tone (p less than 0.05) was noted during and after the infusion. No difference in uterine activity was observed in any of the study periods.

A positive amniotic fluid culture or clinical chorioamnionitis was not associated with a higher incidence of retained placenta. This study indicates that preterm delivery is associated with an increased risk of complications of the third stage of labor.\r"

Overall, there were no differences between the omphalocele and the gastroschisis groups in either cesarean section rate (22% vs 26%) or prematurity rate (26% vs 30%). However, the omphalocele group had a significantly higher infant death rate (22% vs 7%, p less than 0.001), a significantly higher incidence of associated major congenital anomalies (29% vs 5%, p less than 0.001), and a higher incidence of long-term infant morbidity (14.5% vs 8.9%). Within either group there was no significant difference between vaginal and cesarean delivery regarding either infant mortality, acute or long-term infant outcome, or frequency of associated major anomalies. We conclude that vaginal delivery of infants with abdominal wall defects does not adversely affect infant outcome.\r"

There was no correlation between gestational age at rupture of membranes and latency period. Seventy-one infants were delivered. The perinatal survival was 63%. Sixty-eight percent of the survivors had normal neurological and physical development at 1-year follow-up. Amnionitis developed in 43% of patients. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in the neonates was 52%. Betamethasone did not appear to reduce this incidence. The perinatal survival in patients with midtrimester rupture of membranes appears to be improving with the advancements in neonatal care of the extremely premature infant.\r"

  ".U": "90386251\r", 
  ".W": "In 1983 a protocol was established at our institution that used computed tomographic pelvimetry to evaluate patients presenting with a singleton term frank breech fetus for an attempt at vaginal delivery. The criteria for a trial of labor were singleton fetus, term gestation (37 to 42 weeks' gestation from the first day of the last menstrual period), frank breech presentation, estimated fetal weight 2000 to 4000 gm, non-extended fetal head, and adequate computed tomographic pelvimetry. Two digital radiographs and a tomographic cross-section were taken of each patient, i.e., an anteroposterior view, a lateral view, and an axial section through the femoral head at the level of the fovea capitalis. Adequate pelvimetry was defined as: anteroposterior diameter of the inlet greater than or equal to 10.0 cm, transverse diameter of the inlet greater than or equal to 11.5 cm, transverse (interspinous) diameter of the midpelvis greater than or equal to 9.5 cm, and posterior sagittal diameter of the midpelvis greater than or equal to 4.0 cm. The purpose of this prospective analysis was to determine the obstetric and perinatal outcome of those breech fetuses that were evaluated with these criteria during the study period of January 1984 through July 1989. During this period the incidence of breech deliveries at our institution was 2.71% (394/14,542). Of these 394 breech deliveries, 122 patients underwent computed tomographic pelvimetry. Eighty-five patients had adequate pelvimetry, fulfilling the protocol criteria, and formed the study group. Eighty-one percent (69/85) of the study group had successful vaginal deliveries (group 1). Nineteen percent (16/85) required cesarean delivery after a trial of labor (group 2) (10 with fetal distress and six with arrested labor disorders). Of the 37 patients who had inadequate computed tomographic pelvimetry and underwent cesarean delivery without a trial of labor (group 3), 54% (20/37) had an extended fetal head, 21.6% (8/37) had an inadequate transverse diameter of the inlet, 13.5% (5/37) had an inadequate midpelvic posterior sagittal measurement, and 10.8% (4/37) had an inadequate interspinous diameter. Perinatal outcome including Apgar scores, cord gases, length of hospital stay, neonatal complications, was evaluated. No difference in infant complications was noted between the group delivered vaginally and the groups delivered abdominally. The only maternal complications in our study group were chorioamnionitis, endomyometritis, and postpartum anemia. There were no significant differences in the incidence of chorioamnionitis among the three groups of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients who were greater than or equal to 3 cm dilated on admission were at high risk of therapy failure by all outcome measures compared with patients less than 3 cm dilated. For patients less than 3 cm dilated on admission, there was no difference in outcome when patients treated for contractions only were compared with those treated after change in effacement or dilatation had been documented. We conclude that awaiting change in cervical effacement or dilatation to be more certain of the diagnosis of preterm labor will not compromise the efficacy of ritodrine tocolysis.\r"

Seventy-seven patients had negative amniotic fluid Gram stains and were managed expectantly. Thirty-one patients had positive amniotic fluid Gram stains confirmed by subsequent cultures and were delivered of infants on that basis. A univariate comparison of various parameters revealed significant differences in maternal temperature, pulse, and white blood cell count. Patients with positive Gram stains had lower mean gestational age, higher baseline fetal heart rate, and nonreactive fetal heart rate tracings. On the basis of a multivariate stepwise discriminate analysis, fetal heart rate greater than 150 beats/min or nonreactive nonstress test were the best predictors of the Gram stain findings, with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 76%, and negative predictive value of 87%. These data suggest that in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and fetal tachycardia or nonreactive nonstress test, amniocentesis should be performed in the initial evaluation.\r"

Fifty patients in preterm labor were enrolled. In the first phase 25 patients were studied so that the apparent volume of distribution for the loading dose of magnesium sulfate could be estimated and an adjusted loading dose could be calculated. The efficacy of this adjusted loading dose was then tested on a further 25 patients in the second phase. We found that the apparent volume of distribution could be accurately estimated and an adjusted loading dose calculated, with the use of ideal body weight, degree of underweight, and current use of beta-sympathomimetics. In the adjusted loading dose group therapeutic levels were achieved more often, with higher postloading magnesium levels and a greater decrease in contraction index immediately after the loading dose. We conclude that an adjusted loading dose can be calculated for magnesium sulfate to optimize tocolytic therapy.\r"

Three tests were assessed: (1) lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio, (2) phosphatidylglycerol concentration, and (3) optical density at 650 nm. From January 1987 through June 1989, 526 diabetic gestations were delivered within 5 days of fetal lung maturation testing. Surfactant-deficient respiratory distress syndrome was present in five infants (0.95%); all were less than 34 weeks' gestational age. Other causes of respiratory distress were transient tachypnea of the newborn (n = 5), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 2), polycythemia (n = 1), and meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 1). The use of standard maturity values of lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio greater than or equal to 2.0, phosphatidylglycerol greater than 2% to 5%, and optical density at 650 nm greater than or equal to 0.150 were evaluated. Each test had a 100% sensitivity in identifying surfactant-deficient respiratory distress syndrome and a 100% negative predictive value in identifying the absence of disease. All three tests had a low positive predictive value: 15% for lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio, 9% for phosphatidylglycerol, and 3% for optical density at 650 nm. We concluded that most cases of respiratory distress in the infants of diabetic mothers were unrelated to surfactant deficiency. The standard maturity values used in fetal lung maturation tests were valid in the diabetic gestation. The optical density at 650 nm was useful as a first-line test to predict the absence of surfactant-deficient respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Animals were killed on days 18 to 20 of pregnancy and their fetuses were removed by hysterectomy. Autopsies were performed on all fetuses. There were significant differences among groups with regard to maternal weight gain and pregnancy resorption. More pregnancy resorptions were noted in the group that received normal human doses (4 mg/kg/day) of pentamidine than in the control group (p less than 0.05). One structural anomaly consisting of unilateral renal agenesis was noted in the 711 fetuses examined. Skeletal survey of fetal rats was unremarkable. Pentamidine was without teratogenic effects in rats when administered in doses similar to those recommended for adult humans; however, it appears to have an embryocidal effect when given in those same doses during embryogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies have identified a correlation between the rate of fetal loss (subsequent to chorionic villus sampling) and the operator's level of experience. However, centers performing only modest numbers of procedures during the initial phase of their programs have reported loss rates similar to those of the more active diagnostic units. Our personal experience would suggest that a \"learning curve\" for chorionic villus sampling does exist but that fetal loss may be an insensitive end point with which to evaluate the impact of cumulative performance. In an attempt to quantify the learning curve that we have appreciated subjectively, a detailed analysis of our initial experience with chorionic villus sampling was undertaken. Between May 1988 and August 1989, a total of 185 procedures were accomplished consecutively by one operator and form the basis for this analysis. Transcervical (n = 82) and transabdominal (n = 103) techniques were used for posterior and anterior-fundal placental locations, respectively. Three pregnancy losses occurred and insufficient material for analysis was retrieved in five patients. We observed a significant reduction in the required number of placental aspirations during the study interval (p less than 0.001). When analyzed separately, consecutive performances of the transabdominal technique demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean number of placental passes (p less than 0.00001) along with more efficient sampling (increased sample weight/aspiration attempt; p less than 0.01). Although the fetal loss rate is a critical measure of safety and may directly be related to operator experience, other measures of expertise (e.g., single-pass success rate) may be more appropriate indicators of competence and may be useful to centers wishing to initiate their own chorionic villus sampling programs.\r"

Whether this association includes cytogenetic abnormalities is less clear. A retrospective review of all detected chromosomally abnormal pregnancies at the University of Maryland was carried out. Of 109 cytogenetically abnormal pregnancies, the number of umbilical cord vessels could be documented in 53 cases. Six (11.3%) had a single umbilical artery. A single umbilical artery was noted in two of nine fetuses (22.2%) with trisomy 18 and in two of six fetuses (33.3%) with trisomy 13. Two other unusual chromosomal constitutions were noted in cases of a single umbilical artery. None of the 11 fetuses with sex chromosome abnormalities (including eight with monosomy X) had a single umbilical artery. Of 18 fetuses with trisomy 21, none had a single umbilical artery. This study suggests that a single umbilical artery is preferentially associated with certain karyotypic abnormalities and that trisomy 21 does not appear to be associated with a single umbilical artery.\r"

Successful procedures were completed in 97.7% (420/430) of patients in the chorionic villus sampling group, compared with 99.5% (428/430) in the amniocentesis group (p less than 0.01). Success was more frequent with only one attempt in the amniocentesis group (427/428) versus 354 of 420 in the chorionic villus sampling group (p less than 0.001). Culture failure was more common after chorionic villus sampling (p less than 0.001). Pregnancy loss rates through 28 weeks' gestation and the entire gestation were not significantly different. The prevalence of preterm delivery did not vary between groups, but birth weights of infants in the chorionic villus sampling group were significantly greater. In summary, the present investigation supports previous findings that chorionic villus sampling is a safe alternative to amniocentesis and is not associated with long-term pregnancy complications.\r"

To date, 40 procedures have been performed. The main indication for the late chorionic villus sampling was a low serum alpha-fetoprotein value in association with an increased risk for Down syndrome (n = 28), abnormal ultrasonographic finding (n = 7), and failed amniotic cell culture (n = 3). Successful karyotype results were achieved in all but two cases. Most results were obtained within 48 hours with direct cytogenetic techniques. No cases of mosaicism were found. The highest yield of abnormal karyotypes was obtained from the cases with abnormal ultrasonographic findings (one trisomy 21, two 45,X). One case of trisomy 21 was identified in the 28 cases of low serum alpha-fetoprotein. No spontaneous losses have occurred. The technique is easy to learn, does not differ from first-trimester procedures, and may have a lower complication rate than cordocentesis. The reporting of cases to the CVS Newsletter should help evaluate late chorionic villus sampling as another method for rapid fetal karyotyping.\r"

This lesion has been associated with fetal death, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth retardation and is thought to be recurrent. Sixty cases of maternal floor infarction were identified in 48 women. Fetal death occurred in 24 of the 60 cases (40%). Preterm birth occurred in 21 of 36 (58.3%) live-born infants, and 19 of the 35 (54.2%) live-born infants for whom a birth weight was known had evidence of intrauterine growth retardation. Among the 41 multiparous patients in our series there were five documented recurrences (12.2%). Review of the past reproductive history of these 48 patients (196 pregnancies) demonstrated a significant incidence of fetal death (24.1%), intrauterine growth retardation (31.3%), and preterm death (35.4%). The association of fetal death and maternal floor infarction emphasizes the importance of a placental examination with all cases of fetal death and infants with intrauterine growth retardation. Given the risk of recurrence, the identification of maternal floor infarction should alert the clinician to the potential for growth retardation, preterm birth, and fetal death in subsequent pregnancies.\r"

Tissues were obtained from the myometrium near the placental bed and from the opposite side of the uterus. Skin biopsies were also obtained from eight women with preeclampsia and liver biopsies were obtained from two patients with acute microvesicular fatty change of pregnancy (one with and one without concomitant preeclampsia). Specimens were examined histologically and by electron microscopy. Mitochondrial changes in small vessels, principally venules, in myometrial smooth muscle, myometrial interstitial cells, circulating leukocytes, epidermal and dermal cells, and hepatocytes were examined and compared between women with preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. These findings were then compared with mitochondria from 500 biopsies over the same 3-year interval to assess the possible role of delay in tissue fixation. There were 12 other biopsies from nonpregnant women of childbearing age. As further control on artifact, other specimens were initially sampled immediately in the operating room and then serially for up to 2 hours later. Artifact as a basis for the mitochondrial changes was ruled out by these procedures. Normal mitochondria undergo a morphologic conformational sequence with physiologic changes in substrate, oxygen consumption, adenosine diphosphate, and respiratory rate. The mitochondria of preeclamptic tissues show a central disruption that is outside this normal sequence or cycle. This disruption occurs more often and is more severe in preeclampsia than in normotensive pregnancies. In addition, the hypertrophic smooth muscle of the pregnant uterus has a complex of cytoplasmic organelles in a paranuclear location, usually apical, that contains a variable mixture of glycogen, the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and small unidentified microvesicles. This complex has the location and appearance suggestive of a myometrial \"power pack\" of significance in metabolism and contraction. The presence of similar mitochondrial changes in a limited sample of nonuterine tissues is suggestive of a systemic metabolic disorder as an important feature of preeclampsia.\r"

The number of cases with absent phosphatidylglycerol were determined at each specific gestational age at or near term. Phosphatidylglycerol was present in 130, and phosphatidylglycerol was absent in 23 at first amniocentesis sampling. A significant proportion (approximately 21%) of those with gestational diabetes were phosphatidylglycerol-negative as late as 38 weeks' gestation. A similar proportion of overt diabetic patients were phosphatidylglycerol-negative as late as 39 weeks' gestation. These figures give the clinician some estimate of the likelihood of the absence of phosphatidylglycerol at or near term if amniocentesis is used before elective delivery in these patients.\r"

The prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 13.6% (23/168). Patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures for microorganisms had significantly lower median amniotic fluid glucose concentrations than patients with negative amniotic fluid cultures (median 11 mg/dl, range 2 to 30 mg/dl vs median 28 mg/dl, range 3 to 74, respectively; p less than 0.001).

Efforts to control the disease depend on the effectiveness of established screening strategies and treatment of infected pregnant women. False-negative test results hinder these efforts and leave the fetus at risk for acquiring congenital syphilis. Recently we encountered four cases of false-negative syphilis serologic results in women who gave birth to infants with congenital syphilis. The false-negative results were caused by the prozone phenomenon. The prozone phenomenon, seen during primary and secondary syphilis, occurs because a higher than optimal amount of antibody in the tested sera prevents the flocculation reaction typifying a positive result in reagin tests. Serum dilution is necessary to make the correct diagnosis. We recommend that for any pregnant woman with apparently negative syphilis serologic results in whom fetal compromise of unknown etiology exists, particularly nonimmune hydrops, nontreponemal testing should be repeated using serum dilutions to prevent a missed diagnosis of syphilis. We further recommend serum dilution as a routine procedure for all pregnant women in areas of high syphilis prevalence.\r"

HBsAg was present in 0.3% of public patients and 0.08% of private patients.

The time interval from birth to administration of hepatitis B immune globulin in the newborn averaged 13.3 hours. Patient cost per new case detected was $13,203. Intrapartum hepatitis B surface antigen screening with an assay performed once daily allows for timely administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to the newborn in accordance with recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, although some newborns receive hepatitis B immune globulin after the 12-hour birth-to-administration interval recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.\r"

Pregnancy-related outcome variables studied were prevalence of preterm labor or birth, birth weight, and trimester of occurrence. Pneumonia characteristics studied were rate and type of organisms recovered, seasonality, and severity of the illness and radiologic findings. Exposure variables relating to the development of pneumonia studied were underlying medical conditions, hematocrit, human immunodeficiency virus status, and drug use. Birth weight, hematocrit, human immunodeficiency virus status, and drug use were compared with a randomly selected sample of women drawn from the general population delivered of infants during the study time period. One patient experienced preterm delivery, which occurred 1 month after cure of pneumonia. Birth weight was significantly lower in the study group (2770 +/- 224 gm versus 3173 +/- 99 gm, p less than 0.01). The most common organism recovered was Streptococcus pneumoniae. A total of 42% of patients had multilobar involvement and two required intubation. Cocaine use (52% in the study group versus 10% in the general population, p less than 0.01) and human immunodeficiency virus positivity (24% in the study group versus 2% in the general population, p less than 0.01) were significant risk factors for antepartum pneumonia.\r"

All patients underwent the same implant technique and rehabilitation program. Followup ranged from 24 to 36 months. The evaluation consisted of subjective, objective, and instrumented laxity testing (KT-1000, MEDmetric, San Diego, CA; and Genucom, FARO Medical Technologies, Inc., Montreal, Canada). There were 31 males and 10 females. Eleven (79%) patients in Group 1 thought their knee was \"normal\" or \"improved,\" and 25 (93%) in Group 2 thought the same. In addition, 10 (71%) patients in Group 1 denied any \"giving way,\" compared to 26 (96%) in Group 2.

The surgical technique of diagnostic arthroscopy and open longitudinal release has been described previously by the author, emphasizing the specific anatomical structures to be divided. The synovium was never incised and the retinacular structures were freed to allow reduction of the patella medially. Sixty patients comprising 76 knees were reviewed at a mean followup of 4 years postrelease. Followup included evaluation of Merchant views and Q angles, physical examination, and determination of patient satisfaction. Eighty-five percent of the patients followed retained the good to excellent ratings they had at the 2 year followup. \"Reduction\" of the released patella on Merchant views correlated well with surgical outcome and patient satisfaction in 95% of cases. Residual Merchant view patellar tilt or excessive lateral position correlated well with poor results. Hematoma formation was the leading cause of failure. A severe preoperative Q angle correlated somewhat with results at 4 years but this was not statistically significant. The degree of articular cartilage disease at prerelease arthroscopy did not correlate at all with results at 4 years, nor did the duration of preoperative symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One side was tested with a Cybex at 60 deg/sec and the other with a hand-held dynamometer. Six maximal trials, following warmup, were conducted on each of 5 days, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. Intraday correlations of individual trials ranged from 0.82 to 0.995 for hand-held dynamometer, and 0.88 to 0.996 for Cybex. Interday correlations ranged from 0.94 to 0.98 for hand-held dynamometer, and 0.88 to 0.97 for Cybex. The best values to use for Cybex interday variability were the average of the first three repetitions, and yielded standard errors of 8.6% to 19.2% of the sample mean. The average of the last three repetitions were the best for hand-held dynamometers, and yielded standard errors of 5.5% to 10.8%. There was a significant decline (P less than 0.05) in strength of the mean of the last three versus the mean of the first three daily repetitions on Day 1 and 4 for hand-held dynamometers, and a trend toward this on the other days, that was not seen with Cybex. Regression of average Day 1 values for Cybex and hand-held dynamometer yielded r = 0.86 (P less than 0.01) with a slope of 1.07 indicating good agreement between modalities. In conclusion, intraday/interday correlations were high for Cybex and hand-held dynamometer. Interday variability was minimized by using the mean score of the first three and last three repetitions for Cybex and hand-held dynamometer, respectively. Changes in Cybex and hand-held dynamometer strength of less than 19% and 11%, respectively, are within the area of \"measurement error\" and should therefore not be considered clinically significant.\r"

In order to quantitatively define the requirements of adequate protective synergy of the internal and external rotator musculature, as well as the primary capsulolabral restraints, we prospectively evaluated 53 subjects: 15 asymptomatic volunteers, 28 patients with glenohumeral instability, and 10 patients with impingement syndrome. Range of motion was evaluated by goniometric technique in all patients with glenohumeral instability and impingement. Laxity assessment was performed and anterior, posterior, and inferior humeral head translation was graded on a scale of 0 to 3+. Isokinetic strength assessment was performed in a modified abducted position using the Biodex Clinical Data Station with test speeds of 90 and 180 deg/sec. Internal and external rotator ratios and internal and external rotator strength deficits were calculated for both peak torque and total work. Patients with impingement demonstrated marked limitation of shoulder motion and minimal laxity on drawer testing. Both anterior and multidirectional instability patients had excessive external rotation as well as increased capsular laxity in all directions. Sixty-eight percent of the patients with instability had significant impingement signs in addition to apprehension and capsular laxity. Isokinetic testing of asymptomatic subjects demonstrated a 30% greater internal rotator strength in the dominant shoulder. Comparison of all three experimental groups demonstrated a significant difference between internal and external rotator ratios for both peak torque and total work. Conclusions are that there appears to be a dominance tendency with regard to internal rotator strength in asymptomatic individuals. Impingement syndrome and anterior instability have significant differences in both strength patterns of the rotator muscles and flexibility and laxity of the shoulder. Isokinetic testing potentially may be helpful in diagnostically differentiating between these two groups in cases where there is clinical overlap of signs and symptoms.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether enforced exercise (over and above motion ad libitum) would have a further beneficial effect or, instead, an adverse effect on the healing of ligaments. Large male Sprague-Dawley rats with unrepaired transections of the medial collateral ligament were separated into five groups of similar mean weights. Two of these groups had the anterior cruciate ligament and the medial capsule transected in addition to the medial collateral ligament, rendering the knee unstable. The groups were then subjected to varying regimens of enforced exercise (swimming). After 12 days, the mechanical characteristics of the femur, medial collateral ligament, and tibia complex were evaluated. Rats with intact secondary valgus stabilizers (medial capsule and anterior cruciate ligament) that swam daily for either 5 (moderate) or 15 (near exhaustion) minutes were found to have increases in the tensile strength of the femur, medial collateral ligament, tibia complex as compared to rats that did not swim. Unstable knees (with transected secondary valgus stabilizers) did not show an increase in the tensile strength of the femur, medial collateral ligament, tibia complex when subjected to moderate increase in enforced exercise (swimming 5 minutes). The unstable groups were, however, significantly more lax than the groups that underwent identical exercise regimens but had intact secondary valgus stabilizers. Significant differences in the stiffness of the ligaments in the different groups were not detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of three runners who were no longer active, one had stopped running in the late 1970s because of osteoarthrosis of both the lower and upper extremity joints. The remaining 27 runners (90%) were still active, having run 20 to 40 km/week (12 to 24 miles/week) for a median of 40 years. Subjective, objective, and roentgenographic data were compared with the data for 27 nonrunning controls matched as to age, weight, height, and occupation. No differences in joint alignment, range of motion, or complaints of pain were found between runners and nonrunners. Roentgenographic examinations for cartilage thickness, grade of degeneration, and osteophytosis were also without significant differences between the two groups. Thus, our observations suggest that a lifetime of long distance running at mileage levels comparable to those of recreational runners today is not associated with premature osteoarthrosis in the joints of the lower extremities.\r"

Isometric flexion, extension, and lateral bending were performed. The motor output, including fatigue, was studied by means of a load cell and using electromyography. The wrestlers were found to have symmetrical strength and were stronger in all measured directions, especially in side bending (flexion, 852 N; extension, 951 N; right and left side bending, 759 N and 744 N, respectively), than the tennis players and normal subjects of any published study. The development of fatigue in the erector spinae muscles, as evaluated by spectral analysis of the myoelectric signal, was not symmetrical and was significant bilaterally at the lumbar level and on the right side at the thoracic level. As expected, the tennis players had asymmetrical isometric strength. They were stronger in left side bending than right side bending (643 N compared with 557 N, P less than 0.01), and stronger in extension than flexion (835 N compared with 638 N, P less than 0.01). The development of fatigue in the erector spinae muscles was significant bilaterally at the lumbar level and on the left side at the thoracic level. The development of fatigue in the tennis players was less than that of the wrestlers except for the left thoracic measurement site. Our conclusions are that tennis players appear to be relatively weak in trunk flexion. The wrestlers displayed a development of fatigue that was asymmetrical and was of nearly the same degree as the tennis players, but on the opposite side.\r"

In the first phase of the study we investigated the reproducibility of anterior/posterior stress tests at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion and varus/valgus stress tests at 20 degrees of flexion in 10 control subjects during three seatings on 3 separate days. In the second phase we studied the effect of errors in the digitization procedure (a part of the patient installation process) on anterior/posterior translation measurements. In the third phase we studied the reproducibility of a battery of tests in patients with chronic unilateral ACL deficient knees. The test battery was repeated 8 times on each knee on 6 separate days. In Phase I, analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between tests within a single seating. The day-to-day variance of all subjects was not significant, but we found a significant interaction between day and subject which was due to significant day-to-day differences in individual subjects. We found in Phase II that changing the location of the tibial joint line digitization points in the anterior/posterior or proximal/distal direction affected anterior/posterior translation measurements. Effects were larger at 30 degrees of flexion than at 90 degrees and when both the medial and lateral points were moved. Movement of the femoral condylar points resulted in a similar pattern of effects. In Phase III, although we found significant differences between our two examiners, there were no significant intraexaminer test-to-test (within seating) effects. Additionally, while there was no significant day-to-day variance overall, we found a significant interaction between day and subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite its popularity, the MEDmetric KT-1000 arthrometer's reliability remains inadequately documented. We conducted this study to determine the magnitude of trial-to-trial (within installation), installation-to-installation (within day), and day-to-day (between day) variability of anterior/posterior translation measurements in normal knees. We selected six normal subjects, three males and three females, and tested each on 6 consecutive days with three separate installations per day. We recorded the total anterior/posterior translation at +/- 89 and +/- 134 N force at 25 degrees of flexion during three consecutive trials in a single installation. Analysis of variance showed that no significant difference existed between trials (within installation) or between installations (within day) for all parameters. However, we did find a significant difference between days for individual right and left knee translation measurements at 89 and 134 N force. More importantly, no significant difference existed between days for right to left differences at both force levels. The magnitude of the expected measurement variability was expressed by computing 90% confidence limits for total anterior/posterior translation at +/- 89 N force. These were +/- 1.5 mm for the right knees, +/- 1.4 mm for the left knees, and +/- 1.6 mm for the right-left differences. Fischer's protected least significant difference post hoc test revealed that for all parameters, the 1st day measurements were significantly less than those on following days, suggesting that patient and examiner adjust to the testing procedure. We conclude that the standard KT-1000 evaluation should report paired differences rather than individual knee measurements. Additionally, initial evaluation should be supplemented by follow-up examinations for verifying translation values.\r"

In six cadaveric elbows, the capsule was distended with saline. Both anterior medial and anterior radial approaches were made with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees. Four and one-half millimeter arthroscopic sheaths were inserted and obturators were then left in place while the saline was drained; expanding polyurethane foam was used to distend the capsule. We allowed the polyurethane foam to harden and then dissected all elbows, with special attention given to exposure of the radial and medial nerve and the brachial artery. The hardened foam allowed for continued capsular distension during these dissections and recreated normal distances from instrument portals to neurovascular bundles. The minimum distance from the path of the arthroscopic sheath to the large neurovascular structures was then measured. The distance from the medial portal to the nearest neurovascular structure (median nerve, brachial artery) averaged 23 mm. The distance from the radial portal to the nearest neurovascular structure (radial nerve) averaged 3 mm. The ulnar nerve averaged a 25 mm clearance from the medial portal. Even when the medial portal was made by an incorrect method, the minimum clearance to the median nerve averaged 11 mm. The most frequently recommended current standard technique for elbow arthroscopy involves beginning with an anterior radial portal. However, the findings in this study suggest that an anterior medial portal is a superior starting point.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about sports medical problems in long distance wheelchair athletes. Using a continuous monitoring system, we studied participants of a yearly wheelchair event lasting 1 week (International Flower Marathon). The aims were 1) to evaluate the medical problems in 40 athletes who took part in the 1986 edition and 2) to explore whether problems in previous editions (1984 and 1985) played a role in the decision to take part in 1986. The results showed that 19 athletes experienced 20 medical problems, many of which were caused by spills or were related to climatologic conditions. Problems were relatively more frequent in paraplegics and polio-disabled athletes (N = 22) than in the remaining competitors (N = 18). Statistical analysis showed that this difference was significant (P less than 0.01). Complaints in previous editions of the same event did not play a role in the athletes' decision to participate in the 1986 edition. This study suggests that the number and seriousness of injuries and other medical problems in disabled wheelers is related to environmental conditions as well as to the nature of disabilities involved. The study also shows, without doubt, that long distance events for wheelers need the support of adequate medical escorts.\r"

Steroid efficacy studies only examine the anabolic effects of individual drugs. However, these 20 steroid users consistently practiced polypharmacy. During steroid use cycles lasting between 7 and 14 weeks, athletes commonly used two or three oral agents and two long-acting injectable products. Dosages of oral preparations tended to be similar to those used in efficacy studies, whereas dosages of the long-acting injectable agents were approximately three to eight times greater than those used in controlled studies. Subjects reported significant increases in body weight and strength. In addition, mental status changes were reported that included symptoms of depression, hostility, aggression, and paranoia. Based on the pattern of anabolic steroid use currently being practiced in the United States, it is apparent that past efficacy and toxicology studies are of limited value in delineating the benefits and hazards of these drugs.\r"

Spirometry measured before and after breathing room air through the experimental circuit for ten minutes was not significantly different. Likewise, there was no difference in baseline spirometry during mild hypoxemia (arterial saturation of 90%) compared with air breathing. The eight asthmatic subjects underwent a methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge on each of the two test days. The PC20FEV1 measured on the \"hypoxemic\" day (3.7 +/- 4.5 mg/mL) was not significantly different from the measured on the \"room air\" day (2.5 +/- 2.4 mg/mL, P greater than .05).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of natural pollen exposure on nasal physiology and inflammatory mediators. Grass pollen counts, ET function (sonotubometry), nasal resistance (rhinomanometry), symptoms, mediator levels (saline wash), and skin test reactivity in nine adults with grass allergy were monitored weekly before (week 1), during (weeks 2 to 9) and after (weeks 10 and 11) grass pollen season. Pollen counts peaked at week 3, and then decreased gradually. Mean nasal resistance (cm H2O/L/sec) increased from a baseline of 2.4 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 1.1 at week 3, peaked at week 4 (5.3 +/- 1.2), remained elevated (weeks 5-8), peaked again at week 9 (6.6 +/- 1.4), and then decreased, Bilateral ET obstruction was not present in any of the subjects at baseline, but was present in five of the nine subjects at week 4. Symptom severity paralleled grass pollen counts. Peak mediator levels were observed at weeks 2 and 9 for histamine and at weeks 3 and 10 for leukotriene C4. Seasonal increases in grass and histamine-induced wheal sizes were also observed. These data show that measurable changes in the function of the nose and ET and the levels of nasal mediators and dermal reactivity accompany and track pollen counts during seasonal exposure and suggest that therapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis should be (1) directed at reducing airway inflammation and (2) continued well beyond the time of peak pollen exposure.\r"

After immunization a 7-day assessment of adverse reactions was made and serial serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody responses were measured during a 28-day period. The incidence of adverse reactions was significantly decreased in the group receiving 0.1 mL and 0.05 mL compared with the group receiving 0.5 mL of vaccine. After immunization with 0.1 mL or 0.05 mL vaccine increases in serum HAI antibody to A/Leningrad, A/Taiwan, and B/Ann Arbor influenza antigens were seen comparable to those observed after 0.5 mL. However the magnitude of these rises were lower and were directly correlated with the dose of vaccine. Since immunization of egg-sensitive allergic patients with influenza vaccine poses a risk of localized and systemic reactions, a common clinical practice is to prevent such reactions by vaccine dilution. Although the results of the present study suggest that vaccine dilution results in a decrease in adverse reactions, there is also the risk of decrease protective immunity with this procedure and therefore the practice should not be condoned.\r"

Relationships between the two positive controls, codeine and histamine, and their use as a reference denominator for ragweed reactions were assessed. Ragweed elicited detectable wheals in 15/56. Histamine phosphate (2.75 mg/mL) elicited a positive wheal response in 52/56 subjects, while codeine phosphate elicited a positive wheal in 39/56 and 30/56 subjects at 30 and 3 mg/mL, respectively. Wheal sizes for codeine phosphate at both 30 and 3 mg/mL showed significantly concordant relationships with histamine phosphate-induced wheal sizes (Spearman rho, P = .0084 and .0155, respectively); however the intersubject coefficient of variation was lower for histamine-induced wheal sizes (44%) than for codeine-induced wheal sizes (64% and 65%, respectively for 30 and 3 mg/mL). When a ratio of allergen to positive control reaction size was used to grade ragweed reactions, different patterns were observed using codeine compared with histamine. These results have implications in utilizing codeine phosphate as a positive skin prick test control for allergy testing.\r"

Furthermore, muscle length influences peak force development. One hundred fifty-three female and 116 male asymptomatic subjects between the ages of 20 and 80 (approximately 20 per decade) were studied. Maximal strength of the quadriceps group was determined isometrically, on a specially designed bench, at 3 hip angles (45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees of extension), which represent three rectus femoris muscle lengths. Maximal strength was observed at a hip angle of 180 degrees and did not decrease significantly from 20 to 50 years of age, although the values for the male and female subjects over 50 years were significantly decreased (approximately 15% per decade). The increase in strength as the muscle was lengthened from 45 degrees to 180 degrees hip angle was about 80% (of the force at 45 degrees) in 20-year-olds; strength decreased progressively with age to a value of approximately 50% in the 70-year-olds. This greater reduction in maximal strength at longer quadriceps muscle lengths has functional significance in rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and eventually, walking and standing.\r"

A goniometer was used to determine hip, knee, and ankle joint range of motion (flexibility), ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the two groups for static balance (p less than .001), leg strength (p less than .01), and hip and ankle flexibility (p less than .01). The results suggest that balance, leg strength, and flexibility may be factors contributing to falls in the elderly.\r"

Subjects included 55 children with confirmed DMD and 55 age-matched controls without neuromuscular disease. All subjects and/or their parents responded to a standard set of questions concerning the frequency of symptoms of UGI dysfunction. Responses of the DMD and control groups were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A significantly higher percentage of DMD patients experienced nasal quality to the voice, dysphagia, choking while eating, the need to clear the throat during or after eating, heartburn, and vomiting during or after meals, than did controls. Only one symptom--heartburn--was found significantly more frequently in the 33 nonambulatory than the 22 ambulatory DMD subjects. These findings document that feeding difficulty and symptoms consistent with oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric dysfunction are more frequent in the DMD population than healthy, age-matched controls.\r"

The technique, using sinusoidal driving of the foot, permitted the separation of muscle stiffness response into its elastic and viscous components. Cooling the calf with ice for 30 minutes increases the rate of change of elastic stiffness with frequency, and it increases the frictional stiffness over a frequency range of 3 to 12Hz. Such cooling would produce an estimated 3% to 10% increase in total stiffness, on average, in a spastic person. This increase in stiffness would counteract reductions in total stiffness achieved during the application of cryotherapy to relieve spasticity. However, one could expect that for a clinically significant reduction of spasticity, the increase in passive stiffness of the muscle generated by cooling would be largely overshadowed by the decrease in reflex reactivity.\r"

Patients with RA have significantly higher scores on the D-ADL scale compared with the P-VAS scale, while patients with noninflammatory diffuse musculoskeletal pain show the reciprocal pattern. Therefore, the ratio of the P-VAS:D-ADL scores differed significantly in the 2 groups. Ratios of less than 3 were seen in 67% of RA patients versus 28% of patients with noninflammatory diffuse musculoskeletal pain, while ratios greater than 5 were seen in 27% of patients with noninflammatory diffuse musculoskeletal pain, but not in any patients with RA. This simple ratio is clearly not a diagnostic test, but provides an initial approach to diagnosis in rheumatic diseases using a self-report questionnaire.\r"

Subjects who were less than 60 years old were selected based on the availability of at least 4 hand radiographs taken during at least 20 years of followup, while subjects who were age 60 or older were required to have had at least 4 hand radiographs taken during only 14 years of followup. Individual joints of the hands were graded for the presence and severity of 5 features of OA: osteophytes, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, lateral deformity, and cortical collapse. They were also graded according to the global Kellgren/Lawrence scale. The incidence and rate of progression of OA, as measured by all scales, increased in progressively older age groups. Cox's proportional hazards models showed that isolated doubtful osteophytes (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 1) and isolated joint space narrowing predicted the development of the radiographic features of OA. The rate of OA progression slowed as the severity increased. We conclude that, in men, the incidence of radiographic features of hand OA increases with age. Regardless of age, the earliest radiographic signs of OA are joint space narrowing and doubtful osteophytes.\r"

A large subset of these autoantibodies use structurally homologous light chains of the kappa III subgroup, which bear the 6B6.6 cross-reactive idiotype (CRI). Although antibody binding activity requires both heavy and light chains, information about the heavy chains used by these autoantibodies is limited. To investigate these proteins, the murine monoclonal antibodies, 5-14 and 6-10, were generated by immunization with the heavy chains of the 6B6.6 CRI-positive RF, COR and LEW. These antiidiotypic antibodies reacted with 8 of 11 autoantibodies that coexpressed the 6B6.6 CRI. All 8 RF had heavy chains from the VH4 gene family, as assessed by reactivity with a VH4-specific primary sequence-dependent antibody. The same RF were also identified by the previously described murine monoclonal antiidiotype, LC1. Further experiments revealed that the LC1 antibody delineates a subfamily of VH4 heavy chains that is preferentially used in kappa III-6B6.6 CRI-positive IgM-RF. The cumulative data suggest that 13-22% of RF express both the kappa III-6B6.6 and VH4-LC1 CRI. These findings document that RF autoantibody activity requires specific VL-VH pairing, and that a subset of idiotypically related VH4 heavy chains is commonly expressed in disease-associated monoclonal IgM-RF.\r"

The antibody was present in the serum of 4% of PM/DM patients, and 18% of PM/DM patients with anticytoplasmic antibodies other than anti-Jo-1, but not in patients with other conditions who had anticytoplasmic antibodies. Anti-SRP was associated with classic adult PM, and some of these cases were unusually severe and/or of rapid onset; it was not found in patients with overlap syndromes or with DM involvement. Unlike patients with antibodies to aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases, patients with anti-SRP had a low frequency of pulmonary fibrosis, as well as of arthritis and Raynaud's phenomenon. Anti-SRP antibodies may serve as a marker for a second, distinct subgroup of adult PM.\r"

Furthermore, in the second week of illness, levels of soluble IL-2R were significantly greater in children who subsequently developed coronary artery aneurysms than in patients with normal appearing coronary arteries.

To determine whether the degrees of severity of OA cartilage changes, of synovitis, and of synovial iron deposition were related to adequacy of hemostasis at the time of ACLT, a modified surgical technique was devised, whereby electrocautery was used to obtain meticulous control of bleeding when the ligament was severed and irrigation was used to remove intraarticular blood before closure of the joint. When no particular attention was given to hemostasis, 69% of the dogs showed synovitis in the OA knee 10 weeks after ACLT; when electrocautery and irrigation were used to maintain hemostasis, synovitis was present in only 24% of the OA knees 10 weeks after ACLT (P less than 0.01). Iron deposits were present in 75% of synovial samples obtained after routine ACLT, but in only 6% (P less than 0.001) when attention was given to hemostasis. Hypertrophy of articular cartilage, chondrocyte cloning, fibrillation, and changes in tangential zone chondrocytes were less prominent in the OA knee when electrocautery and irrigation were used. However, the water content, uronic acid concentration, and rate of net 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan synthesis were similarly increased regardless of the surgical technique used, and presumably, these changes reflect the reaction of joint cartilage to mechanical instability in this model of OA.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of tumour growth beyond the muscularis propria (mesorectal spread) was measured in specimens from 167 consecutive patients with rectal cancer. The 5-year survival was significantly greater in patients with slight mesorectal spread (4 mm or less) than in those with more extensive mesorectal spread (55% [95% confidence interval 42-66%] vs 25% [13-38%]). The prognostic value for survival of mesorectal spread was independent of the presence of lymphnode metastases. There were also significant differences in survival between patients with slight and extensive mesorectal spread among patients with Dukes' stage B tumours (66% [41-82%] vs 37% [14-60%]) and those with Dukes' stage C tumours (30% [12-52%] vs 18% [6-34%]). Thus mesorectal spread of rectal cancer is an important determinant of survival, and its accurate measurement may serve to subdivide Dukes' B and C cases. In this study tumour involvement of the lateral resection margin was not a useful predictor of local recurrence, but it did correlate with poor prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic alcoholism results in thiamine deficiency as a consequence of inadequate dietary intake and of impaired absorption of the vitamin. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that alcohol reduces thiamine phosphorylation to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in brain. TPP is a cofactor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha KGDH) and transketolase (TK), three enzymes involved in cerebral glucose and energy metabolism. Pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency in the rat results in early, selective, reversible reductions of alpha KGDH in brain; PDHC activities are unaffected. Reductions of alpha KGDH are accompanied by decreased aspartate, glutamate and GABA and by concomitantly increased alanine in the brain of thiamine-deficient animals. It is suggested that decreased alpha KGDH, rather than decreased PDHC constitutes 'the biochemical lesion' in thiamine deficiency encephalopathy first enunciated by Peters in the 1930s. If sufficiently prolonged and severe, thiamine deficiency results in brain cell death. Possible mechanisms involved include compromised cerebral energy metabolism and focal accumulation of lactate, both of which could result from decreased activities of alpha KGDH. In addition, it is proposed that brain cell death in severe thiamine deficiency may result from excessive release of excitotoxic amino acids. Comparable mechanisms could be involved in the cell death and in the pathogenesis of the thiamine-unresponsive symptoms of the Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome in humans.\r"

When ethanol is consumed for several weeks under these conditions, (2) the animals should exhibit tolerance to the acute effects of the drug. Furthermore, (3) abrupt termination of drug administration should result in physical signs of drug withdrawal (e.g. audiogenic seizures). (4) Changes in endocrine and liver function would also be expected to occur following the chronic administration of alcohol, such effects being particularly pronounced if the diet of the animal is nutritionally deficient. A number of self-administration, operant conditioning and forced alcohol administration models are critically assessed. A detailed description of the models in which rodents are forced to consume increasing quantities of alcohol as part of a nutritionally enriched milk diet suggests that this method fulfils most of the above criteria.\r"

  ".W": "Among the little-noticed but far-reaching side effects of the Vietnam War was its impact on the higher education system. This often-unpopular war, coupled with the military draft and student deferment policies, led many young men to enter educational institutions of all types. Beginning around 1964, there was a surge of enrollments and degrees granted in higher education that began to abate only after the draft ended in 1973. The leading edge of the post-World War II \"baby-boom\" also became of college age in the mid-1960s and undoubtedly contributed to elevated levels of enrollments and degrees in higher education. But the Vietnam War had an impact over and above the purely demographic, as can be seen when population effects are factored out. This effect largely explains why the numbers of bachelor's degrees and doctorates (Ph.D. degrees and equivalent) granted to men suddenly stopped increasing in 1974 even though the relevant population groups continued to grow throughout the 1970s. The patterns of enrollments and degrees attained by women are quite different from the men's patterns, and they serve to reinforce the evidence of a draft effect. Students in health professions schools of all types were given special consideration under the deferment policies established by the Selective Service System, leading to rapid increases in applications to medical, dental, and other health professions schools during the period 1968-1974. Since then, the health professions schools have had quite similar experiences with applications--those from men have generally declined while those from women have generally increased. Also, career choices are shifting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This shift of care has increased the need for adequate ambulatory care quality assurance, especially in institutions whose beneficiaries have little or no choice of where they receive their health care. Based on a review of the literature and workshop discussions at the Conference on Ambulatory Care and Education, the needs of ambulatory care quality assurance were divided into four categories: (1) administrative procedures; (2) internal and external quality assessment; (3) data management; and (4) research and education. Following a brief overview of these four areas, potential mechanisms for integrating ambulatory care quality assurance into the ongoing education of faculty, residents, and medical students are presented. The paper concludes by identifying needed areas of research and listing recommendations for integrating ambulatory care quality assurance into medical education.\r"

Forces underlying this change include demographics of its population, new fiscal constraints, and the requirements of its academic affiliates. The benefit to the medical school affiliates will be the availability of patients in a structure useful for outpatient teaching of medical students and houseofficers. Barriers to effective delivery of ambulatory health care and education in VA facilities are (1) the historic focus on episodic, inpatient care, (2) continuous changes in eligibility requirements, (3) increases in patient care responsibilities for affiliated faculty, and (4) concomitant withdrawal of resources from the VA at a time when costs of health care and education are increasing. The VA medical centers will be increasingly forced to investigate innovative models for patient care delivery and education in the ambulatory setting.\r"

  ".W": "Primary hyperparathyroidism, although often silent clinically, may lead to significant morbidity if it remains untreated. In more than 95% of all cases the cause is a parathyroid adenoma or glandular hyperplasia. Regression of disease follows successful surgical excision of the abnormal parathyroid gland. Recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by solitary adenomas, which may have an ectopic location. Preoperative localization of lesions may improve postoperative cure rates and decrease morbidity. Thallium T1 201 chloride-technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate subtraction scintigraphy was performed on 15 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of abnormal glands were 90% and 95%, respectively. False-positive or false-negative results were minimize by strict adherence to a protocol and by the use of well-defined diagnostic criteria. Because of the superior sensitivity and specificity, this modality should be the primary imaging method of choice for preoperative evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism. The relative role of other imaging modalities is also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggest that malignant cells from some patients with myeloid leukemias produce colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) that can function as autocrine growth factors in vitro. We have examined the roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) in the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. IL-6 activity was assessed in conditioned medium (CM) from myeloid leukemia cell cultures or cell lysates using IL-6-dependent KD83 and 7TD1 murine cell lines. Media conditioned by cells from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), but not by normal monocytes, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, contained substantial levels (50 to 1,000 U/10(6) cells) of IL-6. The IL-6 content of CM correlated directly with donor peripheral blood WBC count. CM from two of five CMMoL samples also contained greater than 350 pg/mL GM-CSF. Moreover, CMMoL cells spontaneously formed colonies in semisolid medium. CMMoL colony formation could be partially inhibited by antibodies to IL-6 or GM-CSF, whereas combination of these antibodies gave additive, and nearly complete (greater than 93%), inhibition of spontaneous colony formation. Cell lysates from uncultured CMMoL cells from one patient contained abundant GM-CSF protein but no detectable IL-6. These data suggest that IL-6 and GM-CSF act in vitro as autocrine growth factors for CMMoL cells, and that CMMoL cells in vivo may represent a GM-CSF-dependent autocrine growth system.\r"

  ".W": "A complete hematologic remission was achieved in a patient with therapy-related preleukemia and transfusion-dependent pancytopenia after treatment with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The patient remained in remission for nearly 1 year despite the discontinuation of GM-CSF treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest that normal hematopoiesis was restored after GM-CSF treatment. First, the cytogenetic anomaly, which was present before GM-CSF, completely disappeared after three cycles of treatment. Cytogenetic conversion was documented by conventional karyotypic evaluation of mitotic bone marrow cell preparations as well as by premature chromosome condensation analysis of the nonmitotic cells of bone marrow and peripheral blood. Second, the growth pattern and cycle status of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitor cells were found to be normal during remission. Third, X chromosome-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism-methylation analysis of DNA from mononuclear cells (greater than 80% lymphocytes) and mature myeloid elements showed a polyclonal pattern. These findings suggest that restoration of hematopoiesis in this patient after GM-CSF treatment may have resulted from suppression of the abnormal clone and a selective growth advantage of normal elements.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1980, adults with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) have been treated on two clinical studies using intensive timed sequential therapy. All patients ages 16 to 80, including those with secondary AML (SAML) and those with AML preceded by a hematologic disorder (AHD), were treated, regardless of medical complications at the time of diagnosis. The first study combined high doses of cytarabine (ara-C, AC) and daunorubicin (DRN, D) in sequence (Ac2-D-Ac) and resulted in a complete remission rate of 55%. A group of these patients selected by functional status was able to receive a second course of therapy in remission, which resulted in a disease-free survival (DFS) of greater than 40% at 7 years. Because of toxicity in that study, 114 patients were entered on a second trial initiated 4 years ago, using a less aggressive first course, with amsacrine, to achieve a stable remission (Ac2-D-Amsa). This first treatment was followed by a more intensive second course (Ac6-D-Ac). With this two-step approach, a higher complete remission (CR) rate (76% for de novo AML and 54% for SAML-AHD) was achieved, and more patients were able to receive the second course of therapy. At the current median follow-up of 26 months, the median duration of DFS and overall survival are 11 and 14 months for patients with de novo AML. Age less than or equal to 55 is the most significant prognostic factor for both prolonged DFS and overall survival, with median durations of 17 and 18 months, respectively, for these younger patients. Patients with SAML-AHD remain relatively refractory to treatment despite aggressive chemotherapy, with median durations of DFS and overall survival of 9 months and 5 months, respectively.\r"

However, these results have not addressed whether all cells or a subset of the population is capable of hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) production. To resolve this question, we applied in situ hybridization of radiolabeled antisense RNA probes to centrifuged preparations of total blood mononuclear cells (BMCs) and fractionated lymphocyte subpopulations. Without stimulation, no circulating cells expressed detectable levels of GM-CSF or IL-3 mRNA. On stimulation of BMCs with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutinin or PMA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, approximately 5% expressed GM-CSF mRNA and approximately 1% IL-3 mRNA. Control sense probes produced no labeled cells. To determine the subsets of lymphocytes capable of GM-CSF and IL-3 expression, BMCs were fractionated by FACS into CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocyte subsets and CD16+ (NK) cells. The unfractionated cells and cell fractions were then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. Results demonstrated that 3% to 5% of the CD16+, CD8+, and CD4+ lymphocytes produced GM-CSF mRNA. However, the number of IL-3 mRNA-positive cells in the FACS-sorted subsets was greatly reduced (0.02% to 0.05%) as compared with the unseparated cells (1%). Treatment of BMCs with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 1 week followed by PMA plus ionomycin resulted in a lymphocyte population in which 50% and 3% of cells expressed GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA, respectively. Thus, GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA expression in T cells and NK cells is restricted to a small fraction of cells that can be greatly expanded by IL-2 stimulation. These results suggest a possible physiologic mechanism for increasing HGF production by circulating lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90001531\r", 
  ".W": "Lactoferrin (Lf) is a negative regulator of myelopoiesis which operates by suppressing the release from mononuclear phagocytes of GM colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or monokines which can then induce the release of GM-CSA from accessory cells. In this study, endotoxin-depleted, purified iron-saturated human Lf was assessed for its effect on the production of interleukin-1 by cultured monocytes and their subsequent effect on colony-stimulating factor release from cultured fibroblasts. Monocytes were grown with or without Lf and Lf that had previously been incubated with monoclonal anti-Lf. The monocyte-conditioned medium was then either assayed for the presence of interleukin-1 (IL-1) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or for its ability to stimulate fibroblasts to release growth factors for CFU-GM, BFU-E, or CFU-Mix colonies. In the presence of Lf (10(-7) or 10(-8) mol/L), GM colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) was suppressed by 31% to 73%, whereas stimulating activities for BFU-E and CFU-mix colony formation were suppressed by 93% to 100%. Antibody to Lf completely abrogated the suppressive effects observed with Lf, whereas antibody to IL-1 ablated the induction by monocyte-conditioned medium of CSA release by fibroblasts. Lf at 10(-7) and 10(-8) mol/L also reduced IL-1 synthesis by cultured monocytes from 60% to 77%. The inhibitory effects of Lf were only observed when Lf was added before adherence of the monocytes for culture. If Lf was added at the time of adherence or after adherence, no suppression was observed. We conclude that the inhibition of GM-CSA production/release by Lf is mediated through inhibition of the synthesis/release of IL-1 by mononuclear phagocytes. This inhibition of IL-1 prevents accessory cells from producing and/or releasing GM-CSA.\r"

  ".W": "The platelet membrane glycoproteins GPIIb and GPIIIa form a calcium-dependent heterodimer that functions as a receptor for adhesive proteins on stimulated platelets. In this study, we have investigated the kinetics of the assembly reaction that result in GPIIb-IIIa dimerization. Pulse-chase experiments analysis performed on human megakaryocytes obtained from liquid cultures of chronic myelogenous leukemic patients with antibodies specific for GPIIIa or GPIIb demonstrated the existence of a pro-GPIIb-GPIIIa complex and of a large pool (60%) of unassociated GPIIIa; nearly all the GPIIb and the pro-GPIIb molecules were found associated with GPIIIa. This free GPIIIa was not exposed on the cell surface. Pulse-chase experiments on a subclone of the human megakaryocytic cell line LAMA-84 revealed that the cells from this subclone produced only the pro-GPIIb, which was neither processed into mature GPIIb nor expressed on the cell surface. The expression of GPIIIa in PMA treated cells resulted in the production of the mature GPIIb form and the expression of the GPIIb-IIIa complex on the cell surface. These results indicate that assembly between the early forms of pro-GPIIb and GPIIIa is an obligatory step for the maturation of the heterodimer and its expression on the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "Although the control of retroviral disease in animal systems often involves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), the role of cytotoxic function in human retroviral disorders is uncertain. The ability of the neutrophil to kill HIV-infected targets directed by antiviral antibody was examined. Neutrophils from patients with AIDS killed HIV-infected MOLT-3A cells in a manner equivalent to neutrophils obtained from normal volunteers. Both granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) markedly augmented the cytotoxic function. Studies done with fractionated human antisera revealed that ADCC to HIV-infected cells was mediated only by antibody to the env glycoprotein. ADCC in this system was not dependent on oxidative metabolism because neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) were capable of CSF-augmented cytotoxicity. Although ADCC can be mediated by various classes of lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, such cells may be infected by HIV. Because the neutrophil apparently is not productively infected by the virus, it is an ideal cell to focus on with regard to cytotoxic function in AIDS patients. The findings regarding neutrophil ADCC in AIDS are clinically relevant because the availability of CSFs now permits therapeutic regulation of neutrophils in AIDS patients, and presumably natural antibody may be useful in targeting HIV-infected cells for neutrophil cytotoxicity in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90001552\r", 
  ".W": "The production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) designated Ber-H2, directed against a new epitope of the Ki-1 (CD30) antigen, are described. In comparison with the formerly reported Ki-1 MoAb whose reactivity with Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells in frozen tissue sections is well-documented, the Ber-H2 MoAb showed new, important features: the labeling intensity of the Ber-H2 MoAb was much stronger, and the number of positively labeled cells was higher. Most important, however, was that the Ber-H2 MoAb could be applied in routinely processed, formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Therefore, it was possible to investigate an unprecedented number of tumors received as frozen or formaldehyde-fixed material for expression of the CD30 antigen. Beside Hodgkin's disease, the Ber-H2 MoAb labeled a variable number of cells in lymphomatoid papulosis, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and angoimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. Among B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), some cases containing large centroblast-like or immunoblast-like cells or displaying plasma-cellular differentiation were positive. This finding was in keeping with the reactivity of the Ber-H2 MoAb with activated B-cell blasts and a subpopulation of plasma cells in paraffin sections of normal lymphoid tissue. The diagnostic value of the Ber-H2 MoAb was most significant for a group of anaplastic large-cell (ALC) lymphomas (formerly frequently referred to as malignant histiocytosis or regressive atypical histiocytosis), of which more than 50 cases could be investigated, owing to applicability in paraffin sections. Although about one third of these ALC lymphomas did not express the leukocyte common (CD45) antigen, they were consistently reactive with the Ber-H2 MoAb in both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Using the Ber-H2 MoAb, these Ki-1 lymphomas could be easily distinguished from other nonlymphoid anaplastic large-cell tumors.\r"

These results were correlated with serologic characterization of the antibodies, using indirect immunofluorescence and leukoagglutination. Of the 17 sera immunoblotted, 16 showed discrete bands in the molecular weight range of 30 to 112. Three patients with Felty's syndrome reacted with an antigenic target of 80 to 84 Kd molecular mass, a finding not seen in any of the other patients studied. By serologic testing, none of the autoimmune sera showed serologic specificity for any known neutrophil-specific alloantigen. Using an anti-NA-1 serum, we identified antigenic targets at 40, 50, and 101 Kd in both NA-1-positive and NA-1-negative neutrophils. Ten of 17 autoimmune sera showed reactivity in this corresponding range. These studies demonstrate that immunoblotting may be used to identify antigenic targets in autoimmune neutropenia and may suggest a specificity of these antibodies not definable by serologic techniques. Correlation of immunoblot reactivity with disease states associated with immune neutropenia may be useful in the study of the pathogenesis of the different forms of autoimmune neutropenia.\r"

  ".U": "90001563\r", 
  ".W": "Human T-cell receptor (TCR) delta-chain diversity mainly originates from high junctional variability, since only a limited number of germline elements is available. This extraordinary diversity at the V.J junction, due to the use of two D delta elements and extensive incorporation of N nucleotides, constitutes a specific clonal marker for cell populations exhibiting rearranged TCR delta genes. To this end we amplified in vitro by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the TCR delta junctional region of five acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), isolated respective DNA fragments, and used them directly as clonospecific probes. The combination of PCR technology and hybridization to clonospecific probes permitted the detection of leukemia DNA at dilution of 1:100,000 in all five cases. Moreover, we were able to investigate one of the ALL patients 11 months after achieving continuous complete remission. Conventional Southern blot analysis failed to detect rearranged TCR genes at this stage. However, residual leukemic cells could readily be detected by PCR technique. We conclude that the strategy proposed here is a very sensitive tool to detect minimal residual disease in a significant proportion of human lymphoid neoplasias.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies to red cell surface molecules on the invasion of human red cells by the malarial parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi was examined. Antibodies to glycophorin A (GP alpha) inhibit invasion for both parasite species, and this is highly correlated with the degree to which they decrease red cell membrane deformability as measured by ektacytometry. This effect on rigidity and invasion was also seen with monovalent Fab fragments. The closer the antibody binding site was to the membrane bilayer, the greater was its effect on inducing membrane rigidity and decreasing parasite invasion. Antibodies to the Wright determinant in particular were the most inhibitory. This differential effect of the various antibodies was not correlated with their binding affinities or the number of sites bound per cell. Antibodies to surface molecules other than GP alpha were without effect. A novel mechanism is described whereby monoclonal antibodies and their Fab fragments directed at determinants on the external surface of red cells might act to inhibit invasion by malarial parasites by altering membrane material properties.\r"

Both alpha 2-macroglobulin and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases were found in the septic synovial fluids after treatment commenced.

All the MR examinations were performed using an interleaved saturation-recovery/short inversion time (TI) inversion-recovery sequence. Part or all of the pancreas was seen in 96% of normal cases. In inflammatory disease, MR was more accurate than either CT or ultrasound for diagnosis, whilst for the demonstration of pancreatic tumours, MR was found to be no better or worse than either CT or ultrasound. The use of specific T1 measurement for soft-tissue characterization was not useful because of the large overlap in values between normal, inflamed and malignant pancreatic tissue. T1 measurement was found to be useful in differentiating different pathological fluids.\r"

  ".W": "Asthma is a serious health problem, with both mortality and severity increasing in developed countries (55-57). The development of more specific tests to measure the prevalence and incidence of asthma is of paramount importance. Because measurement of BHR is the only practical objective method for assessing the abnormality of the airways in asthma, it is important to continue examining this measurement as a means of detecting asthma and to explore ways of increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the test. At present, it is clear that measurements of BHR in the community cannot be used as a marker of asthma and that the test requires careful interpretation, especially in adult populations. However, it is becoming apparent that moderate and severe levels of BHR (PD20FEV1 less than 0.8 mumol of histamine) are almost always associated with clinically important morbidity, and comparison of this BHR severity in populations may yield more information than comparison of a wider range of severity in which the associated factors are not well-defined. It is important to determine whether this range of severity of BHR is associated with long-term morbidity from asthma, and whether the use of other measurements from the dose-response curve, such as the shape or similarity of curves to different provoking agents, can increase the specificity of the test. It is also important to continue to investigate the risk factors associated with the development and occurrence of BHR so that individuals who are likely to develop BHR can be identified and, in the longer term, preventive measures can be introduced. There have been relatively few studies of the prevalence of BHR in large populations of children and adults in North America. Such studies would provide essential comparative information about apparent regional differences in both the prevalence of and the mortality from asthma.\r"

Pharmacologic agents employed in therapy of childhood asthma, which may modulate both the late asthmatic reaction and bronchial hyperreactivity, include cromolyn sodium, glucocorticoids, and possibly ketotifen. Beta adrenergic agonists, though effectively blocking the early asthmatic response, had no effect on the late response and did not alter bronchial hyperreactivity. Theophylline, in both children and adults, and enprophylline (not yet studied in children) may modify both the early and late responses, but do not appear to have an effect on bronchial hyperreactivity.

Adjuvant therapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide (FAC) in ten patients and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in one patient. At a median follow-up time of 52 months, four patients experienced a relapse and seven patients were disease-free. Of those with recurrent disease, one patient died of metastatic breast cancer. These limited data suggest that adjuvant therapy reduced the risk of recurrence and favorably influenced the survival in this patient population. Adjuvant therapy should be considered in male patients with primary breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "A method to prepare cisplatin suspended in an oily lymphographic agent, Lipiodol (LPS), has been established to deliver cisplatin to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the hepatic artery. Seventy-one patients, one Stage I, 16 Stage II, 16 Stage III, and 38 Stage IV, were treated with LPS therapy. A partial response was obtained in 33 cases (46.5%), a minor response in 20 cases (28.2%), and no change in 18 cases (25.3%). In 34 patients whose serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were greater than 400 ng/ml, the serum AFP levels decreased in 31 patients (91.2%). The AFP decreased by more than 50% in 25 cases (73.5%) and more than 75% in 19 cases (55.9%). The plasma des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels decreased in all of the 26 DCP-positive patients. The survival rate was 77% at 6 months and the 1-year survival rate was estimated to be 55%. The patients treated with LPS therapy survived longer compared with patients given Lipiodol containing neocarzinostatin by the hepatic artery. Complications such as acute gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (24%), cholecystitis (2.8%), pancreatitis (7%), delayed jaundice (7%), and hepatic encephalopathy (4.2%) were observed after therapy. The peak plasma platinum (Pt) concentrations determined as ultrafilterable Pt occurred 5 to 20 minutes, and 5 to 60 minutes as total Pt after the end of LPS injection. The Pt concentrations in the tumor tissues were 42 times higher in four operated cases and 7.1 times higher in six autopsy cases than those in the nontumorous tissue. These results suggest that LPS selectively accumulates in the HCC, is long-lasting and gradually releases the drug. In addition it is effective as a new anti-cancer therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Cortical thymomas had larger epithelial cell nuclei than the medullary type (P less than 0.001). Cortical and medullary thymomas had larger epithelial cell nuclei than the thymic cortex and medulla (P less than 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). The thymic cortex had larger epithelial cell nuclei than the medulla (P less than 0.001). These results confirm that the epithelial cell nuclei of cortical and medullary thymomas correspond morphometrically to the thymic cortex and medulla, respectively, and that most cortical thymomas have a higher malignant grade than the medullary type.\r"

A total of 606 patients were divided into four groups based on their serum AFP levels at the time of diagnosis: group 1 (less than or equal to 20 ng/ml, N = 125), group 2 (20-1000 g/ml, N = 256), group 3 (1000-10000 ng/ml, N = 149), and group 4 (greater than 10000 ng/ml, N = 76). Increasing prevalence of group 1 patients and decreasing prevalence of group 4 were noted during the last 9 years. The proportion of hepatitis B virus-positive cases was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 4. The serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ratio was found to be significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1 regardless of the size of the tumors. The survival rates were compared among the four groups in size matched cases since the size of the tumor significantly influenced their prognosis. The median survival in relatively small HCC patients (less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter, N = 199) were 24.6 months for group 1, 20.6 months for group 2, and 13.7 months for group 3 patients; and those in large HCC (greater than 50% in the proportion of the tumor area, N = 200) were 15.1 months for group 1, 6.3 months for group 2, 5.8 months for group 3, and 5.2 months for group 4. Thus, serum AFP values at the time of presentation are not only of diagnostic value, but also of prognostic significance in patients with HCC.\r"

The age, sex, hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity, alpha-fetoprotein level, and frequency of associated cirrhosis were not statistically different from those in patients without initial bone metastasis. Initial presentation was usually the result of spinal lesion with neurologic compression, and chest wall or scalp mass. Metastasis most commonly involved spine and ribs, and occurred as osteolytic lesions or extrapleural mass. Computed tomography proved best for demonstrating an expansile soft tissue mass with bony destruction. Angiography showed hypervascular appearance over the destructive bone area. Treatment results were poor. The follow-up period ranged from 3 weeks to 14 months with a median survival of 5 months. The data suggested that hepatocellular carcinoma be ruled out in patients with osteolytic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "This study defines the risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in remission, with no posttransplant prophylactic CNS therapy. Ninety-two consecutive patients in complete remission received BMT for ALL (n = 82) or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognostic factors at diagnosis (n = 10). Sixty-six patients received allogeneic BMT (Allo-BMT) and 26 patients, without an identical sibling, underwent autologous BMT (Auto-BMT). Fifteen patients had CNS involvement at diagnosis and underwent BMT in first remission. Eight patients experienced CNS relapse after BMT, corresponding to a probability of 11% at 3 years. Apart from a history of prior CNS involvement, no patient characteristic evaluated statistically influenced CNS relapse after BMT. The probability of CNS relapse was 5.5% for the 70 patients without history of CNS involvement and 27.5% for the 22 patients with prior CNS involvement. However, subgroup analysis showed that the increased risk of CNS relapse is mainly observed in Auto-BMT patients with history of prior CNS involvement, particularly in patients undergoing BMT in first remission (three of five Auto-BMT versus one of ten Allo-BMT). Taking into account the multiple factors which influence the occurrence and the treatment of CNS leukemia, the results on this retrospective study suggests that (1) for patients without CNS involvement at diagnosis and for whom BMT is performed in first remission, cranial irradiation before BMT and posttransplant prophylactic CNS therapy can be omitted because of the low probability of CNS relapse after BMT (3.4%), when total-body irradiation (TBI) is included in the conditioning regimen; and (2) the difference observed between Allo-BMT and Auto-BMT patients with previous CNS involvement and undergoing BMT in first remission could indicate that graft-versus-host leukemia acts even in the CNS in Allo-BMT patients.\r"

It is important to recognize that the patient who has undergone surgery even for s-HCC should be followed as a super high-risk patient at regular intervals using CT. Therapeutic embolization for recurrent patients improved the survival after recurrence.\r"

The results were compared with cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) measurements performed in the same samples by a radioimmunoassay or enzymeimmunoassay. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the alpha 1-AG measurements were low both before the primary operation (37% and 31%, respectively) and the second-look operation (10% and 51%, respectively). Inversely, the CA 125 measurements before the primary operation demonstrated a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 93% and 81%, respectively. In the second-look group the corresponding CA 125 results were 41% and 62%, respectively. The specificity and positive predictive value of alpha 1-AG before the primary and the second-look operation were high and almost identical to those of CA 125 (93%-100%). All patients with increased alpha 1-AG values also had increased CA 125 levels. Alpha 1-AG cannot be distinguished from immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) by radial immunodiffusion technique. In conclusion, the alpha 1-AG analyses did not add new information to the CA 125 measurements. The use of alpha 1-AG (or IAP) as a tumor marker in ovarian cancer cannot be recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Adenomas that contain early invasive carcinoma (ACIC) represent the earliest form of clinically relevant cancer of the colorectum in most patients. In order to assess the incidence of nodal metastases of ACIC, we studied 31 patients in whom the colon was resected after endoscopic polypectomy (EP) done from 1975 to 1987. We also reviewed the pathologic features reported in individual cases and in literature series of ACIC with lymph node metastases published from 1958 to 1986. The lymph node metastatic potential of ACIC is relatively high, ranging from an average value of 8.5% in the literature of to 16.1% in our own study, and is equivalent to the range of 10%-17% that occurs in colorectal carcinomas that invade the submucosa. When an ACIC is seen in an EP specimen in which the polypectomy margin is normal, the decision as to whether the patient should enter a follow-up protocol or have radical surgical resection is determined by the assessment of the probability of the occurrence of nodal metastases. According to several authors, certain histopathologic features make it possible to distinguish between an ACIC with a high-risk of nodal metastases versus those with a low-risk. The most relevant pathologic parameters include the state of the resection margins, the grade of the invasive carcinoma, and the presence or absence of vascular invasion. Of 351 cases of ACIC that were operated on, derived from 16 literature series, 45.6% were high-risk cases and 8.5% had lymph node metastases. In our group of high-risk ACIC that had surgical resection subsequently, the lymph node metastatic rate was 35.7%. Our results help to estimate the nodal metastatic potential of early colorectal carcinomas and stress the importance of adequate pathologic evaluation in order to assess metastatic risk in these patients accurately.\r"

The performance of these catheters was carefully observed in Silastic tubing perfused with blood by a roller pump. Each catheter was used with two types of positioning wire: a rigid wire and a standard J-tip guidewire. Linear regressions of velocity vs. flow rate were performed. Both catheters performed well with the rigid wire (r greater than or equal to 0.992). When used with the J-tip, the end-mounted catheter suffered decreased performance because of positioning difficulties, while the side-mounted catheter performance was within 6% of the ideal. Measurements made with the side-mounted catheter at low flow rates underestimated the expected response for forward flow. Because of the ease of positioning, the side-mounted catheter is judged to be more useful in measuring flow ratios.\r"

The study was performed in 22 healthy patients who received either one per cent etidocaine, 2 mg.kg-1, or bupivacaine 1.5 mg.kg-1 in a double-blind, randomized fashion. The local anaesthetic was dropped onto the fallopian tubes from uterus to fimbriae before tubal occlusion. To establish safety, blood concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites were measured before application and at 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min. The mean peak concentrations were 501.8 +/- 71.3 (SEM) for etidocaine with a range of 225 to 905 ng.ml-1. For bupivacaine, the mean peak concentration was 468 +/- 73.8 SEM with a range from 191 to 1005 ng.ml-1. The mean values are one eighth of the toxic convulsive dose for humans. Etidocaine was metabolized at a faster rate than bupivacaine with a rapid appearance of 2-amino-2'-butyroxylidide (ABX). The bupivacaine metabolite 2,6-pipecoloxylidide (PPX) was detected in low concentrations in the 60-minute samples. We conclude that the topical application of either etidocaine or bupivacaine is a safe procedure in the doses and concentrations used during general anaesthesia for laparoscopic tubal banding.\r"

We have used this technique to assess potential beneficial or detrimental effects of epidural anaesthesia on blood flow to the placenta. Continuous wave Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the S/D ratio in the uterine and umbilical arteries of 12 patients undergoing epidural anaesthesia prior to elective caesarean section. Anaesthesia was achieved using lidocaine and epinephrine. The S/D ratio in both the uterine and umbilical arteries remained unaltered either by the fluid preload or by the epidural anaesthesia. It is concluded that epidural anaesthesia using this technique has neither a beneficial nor detrimental effect on uterine or umbilical blood velocity in the uncomplicated pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Patients presenting for abdominal aortic surgery have a high incidence of vascular disease elsewhere, manifested primarily by hypertension, coronary and cerebrovascular disease, as well as co-existing respiratory, renal and metabolic disorders. Routine clinical assessment, electrocardiogram, chest roentgenograms, resting and exercise radionuclide ventriculography and echocardiography, dipyrdiamole-thallium scanning are all designed to assess the functional status of the myocardium and to detect the presence of significant coronary artery disease. Patients with no abnormalities on physical examination, routine evaluation and no redistribution on dipyridamole-thallium scanning should proceed to surgery with the expectation of very low perioperative cardiac risk. Patients with evidence of coronary artery disease and significant redistribution on dipyridamole-thallium scan should undergo coronary angiography and possible myocardial revascularization before definitive aortic vascular surgery. For high cardiac risk patients with no bypassable lesions presenting for abdominal aortic aneurysm resection a conservative policy of serial three monthly ultrasound or CT assessment may be adopted, with selective resection for rapid aneurysm expansion or symptom development. A variety of extra-anatomical and angioplastic techniques is available for similar high cardiac risk patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. The haemodynamic consequences of aortic cross-clamping, especially in aneurysm patients, include a significant reduction in stroke volume, cardiac index, and myocardial oxygen consumption with an increased systemic vascular resistance. Patients with coronary artery disease may respond to aortic cross-clamping by increasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and by demonstrating ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Pulmonary artery catheterization is especially indicated in patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction, angina or signs of cardiac failure and in patients with evidence of diminished ejection fraction, abnormal ventricular wall motion or myocardial redistribution on preoperative scanning. The more widespread application of intraoperative transoesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide cardiography monitoring techniques into anaesthetic practice will enable measurement of left ventricular dimensions, myocardial performance and wall motion. Suggested guidelines for anaesthetic management are presented in Table VI. A combined opiate-oxygen-volatile anaesthetic agent technique will best ensure a hypodynamic circulation with preservation of myocardial oxygenation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardium is generally thought to express no more than two isoforms of troponin T (TnT). We have recently reported that TnT purified from rabbit myocardium is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into five proteins (TnT1, TnT2, TnT3, TnT4, and TnT5). In this study, these proteins are characterized immunologically and a novel elaborate maturational profile is described. Myocardium was obtained from 23 days of gestation fetal rabbits and 2-day, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month postnatal rabbits. The major species in the adult myocardium, TnT4, was identified on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and excised. The protein was electroeluted and purified. An amino acid microsequence of a cleaved fragment of this protein was found to be virtually identical to residues 86-99 from adult rabbit cardiac TnT. The protein, TnT4, was used to raise a polyclonal antibody. This antibody recognized all five isoforms from purified cardiac TnT, but none of the TnT isoforms from fast skeletal muscle. A monoclonal antibody, Mab JLT-12, raised against a highly conserved epitope of rabbit fast skeletal muscle, recognized all five cardiac as well as five skeletal muscle isoforms. Western blots performed on intact myocardial preparations demonstrated that TnT1, the cardiac isoform with the slowest electrophoretic mobility, was expressed prominently in the immature hearts, in addition to TnT2, TnT3, and TnT4, but TnT1 was not evident in the 3-month and 6-month postnatal hearts. The expression of TnT2 also decreased with maturation. Thus, the number of TnT isoforms expressed in the rabbit decreases with maturation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion injury includes a spectrum of events, such as reperfusion arrhythmias, vascular damage and no-reflow, and myocardial functional stunning. The concept of reperfusion injury remains controversial with many proposed mechanisms when applied to humans, whereas in animal models, there are two main proposed mechanisms: calcium over-load and formation of oxygen free radicals. To prove that reperfusion injury is specifically caused by reperfusion would require evidence that an intervention given at the time of reperfusion can diminish or abolish the injury as in the case of arrhythmias, which are thought to be mediated by excess recycling of cytosolic calcium with delayed afterdepolarizations and ventricular automaticity. In the case of myocardial stunning, the phenomenon may be mediated, at least in part, by a burst of free radicals formed within the first minute of reperfusion and improved by free radical scavengers given at the time of reperfusion. The alternate hypothesis is that cytosolic calcium overload damages mechanisms for normal intracellular calcium regulation so that the stunned myocardium responds to agents that are thought to increase intracellular cytosolic calcium, such as beta-receptor agonists. A further component of reperfusion injury, under active investigation, is microvascular damage with alterations at the level of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial integrity. From the therapeutic point of view, the divergent results of experimental interventions and the possibility that the abrupt onset of reperfusion in animals differs from the situation in humans with thrombolysis means that the best way currently available to limit reperfusion injury is by minimizing the ischemic period by early reperfusion and by optimizing the metabolic status of the ischemic myocardium at the end of the ischemic period.\r"

The two general clinical syndromes of sustained arrhythmias that result appear to have distinct clinical properties that are consistent with the proposed basic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. Torsades de points occurs most commonly in association with administration of type Ia antiarrhythmic agents and has characteristics most consistent with triggered activity mediated by early after depolarization. Conversely, incessant, sustained, monomorphic, wide complex ventricular tachycardia occurs most commonly in association with type Ic antiarrhythmic agents and has characteristics most consistent with incessant reentry. These general subdivisions are probably oversimplified, and in fact, much overlap likely exists. In addition, these proposed mechanisms may not apply to other forms of proarrhythmia such as an increased frequency of isolated ventricular premature couplets or repetitive forms. Furthermore, proarrhythmia may also occur during treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias; although some of these described syndromes are consistent with incessant reentry, the clinical syndromes are not sufficiently defined to better characterize potential mechanisms. Further investigation, therefore, is needed to better define the mechanisms in question, but the mechanisms proposed in this article help to provide a rational approach toward understanding and dealing with clinical proarrhythmia.\r"

The catheter was 1.2 mm in diameter and incorporated a single 20-MHz ultrasound transducer to obtain cross-sectional images of the arterial lumen. In 15 of the 17 (88%) arteries, high quality images were obtained, which demonstrated clear demarcation between the lumen and the endothelium, the atheroma plaque, the muscular media, and the adventitia. Qualitative characteristics of plaque disruption, dissection, and residual flaps were readily visible. In addition, quantitative information about cross-sectional lumen area was obtained before and after balloon dilatation. The mean cross-sectional lumen area increased from 8.7 to 15.1 mm2 (p less than 0.01) following balloon dilatation. The lumen area measured from the ultrasound images following dilatation correlated closely with the area measured from histologic sections (r = 0.88). The results from this study indicate that a small-diameter ultrasound imaging catheter can be developed that will provide high-resolution qualitative and quantitative information during peripheral and coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to further clarify the mechanism of the maintenance of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the effects of four antagonists with different ancillary properties (acebutolol, atenolol, pindolol, and propranolol) on systemic and renal hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, hormones, and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density were studied in four groups of 10 hypertensive patients. The patients were observed for 3 weeks during active treatment and for 2 weeks after withdrawal of treatment. At the end of the 3-week treatment period, the four drugs had an equal antihypertensive effect (fall in mean arterial pressure, 10-13%). Although renin activity was suppressed (60-70%) by all four drugs, changes in renin or pretreatment values of renin levels were not correlated with the fall in blood pressure. The drugs had no effect on plasma catecholamine concentrations or body fluid volumes. Despite similar antihypertensive effects among the four drugs, the changes in flow and resistance underlying the fall in blood pressure differed considerably. With pindolol, the fall in blood pressure was associated with a fall in vascular resistance (26 +/- 6%), whereas with propranolol, it was predominantly associated with a fall in cardiac output (11 +/- 7%). No significant changes in vascular resistance or cardiac output occurred with atenolol or acebutolol. The changes in renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance occurred in parallel with the changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Plasma epinephrine concentration and pretreatment cardiac chronotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol appeared to be inversely correlated with lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) (r = -0.41 and -0.43, respectively). With pindolol, Bmax decreased maximally by 39 +/- 6%, and with propranolol, it increased by 51 +/- 17%. With both drugs, significant changes in Bmax were already present 24 hours after treatment. Furthermore, 1 week after withdrawal of treatment with pindolol, Bmax was still down-regulated, and cardiac chronotropic responsiveness was still decreased, whereas 1 week after withdrawal of propranolol, Bmax was still up-regulated, and cardiac chronotropic responsiveness was still increased. No changes in Bmax occurred with the beta 1-selective antagonists acebutolol and atenolol. Thus, despite an equal antihypertensive effect, the four beta-adrenoceptor antagonists appear to have dissimilar effects on cardiac output, renal blood flow, and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors. Changes in cardiac output, the circulating blood volume, or angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction are factors unlikely to be crucial for the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Therefore, interference with vasoconstrictor nerve activity through blockade of either central or peripheral prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors could be an alternative explanation of their blood pressure-lowering potential.\r"

Previous experimental studies have indicated that altered acoustic properties of the myocardium are reflected by the magnitude of variation of IB during the cardiac cycle. In our study, cardiac cycle-dependent variation of IB was noninvasively measured using a quantitative IB imaging system in 12 patients with uncomplicated pressure-overload hypertrophy and 13 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sixteen normal subjects served as a control. The magnitude of cardiac cycle-dependent variation of IB for the posterior wall was 6.0 +/- 0.9 dB in normal subjects, 5.7 +/- 0.8 dB in the patients with uncomplicated pressure-overload hypertrophy, and 6.7 +/- 2.1 dB in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There were no significant differences among any of these groups. In contrast, the magnitude of cardiac cycle-dependent variation of IB for the septum was significantly smaller in the patients with uncomplicated pressure-overload hypertrophy (2.8 +/- 1.3 dB) and in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3.1 +/- 2.3 dB) than in normal subjects (4.9 +/- 1.0 dB). The magnitude of cardiac cycle-dependent variation of IB was smaller as the wall-thickness index increased (r = -0.53, p less than 0.01, n = 82 for all data). This IB measure also correlated with percent-systolic thickening of the myocardium (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01, n = 82). Thus, alteration in the magnitude of cardiac cycle-dependent variation of IB was observed in hypertrophic hearts and showed apparent regional myocardial differences.\r"

It is now recognized that CDH is a spectrum of diseases with differing etiologies, pathologies, and natural histories that, as a result, require different treatment approaches. The etiology of CDH involves genetic, hormonal, mechanical, and environmental influences. This recognition of mechanical factors that predispose to CDH has allowed the identification of high-risk patients. Screening for CDH in the new born has resulted in many more patients being diagnosed earlier. Ultrasonography has added a new dimension to CDH diagnosis, since it has demonstrated abnormal hips in otherwise normal children. In the newborn, the use of ultrasonography may be the single most important recent contribution to the study of this disease. The natural history of CDH is well-known: The disease often can lead to early coxarthrosis. However, avascular necrosis is a complication of treatment and results in a hip that may be worse than one not treated at all. Treatment of CDH includes gentle closed reduction in the majority of patients. In patients under six months of age, this can usually be achieved with the Pavlik harness. Up to the age of three years, gentle manipulative closed reduction after traction is successful in the majority of patients. The trend toward the use of home traction and away from inpatient skeletal traction has been documented by many centers to be successful. Open reduction is becoming infrequently required and has specific indications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A progressive spinal or peripheral neuromuscular disorder must be excluded by a thorough clinical evaluation. With the failure of nonoperative modalities, surgical options depend on patient age, etiology of the deformity, and the constellation and flexibility of the defects observed. If the hindfoot varus is flexible, correction of the cavus and forefoot pronation through extensive plantar release and metatarsal osteotomies is reliable. The underlying muscle imbalance must be addressed through tendon transfers to prevent further progression. In the young child, a rigid hindfoot varus will often be corrected by a radical plantar-medial release, but the more mature foot may require midtarsal osteotomy and calcaneal osteotomy or triple arthrodesis. The surgery is usually staged to provide correction of deformity and stabilization of the hindfoot prior to tendo Achilles lengthening or tendon transfer. Arthrodesis of a previously well-corrected foot is common due to progression of the neurologic deficit or failure to achieve muscular balance. The claw toe deformity also must be corrected by tendon transfer, osteotomy, and arthrodesis for reasons of both comfort and function.\r"

The chemical mechanism of action of HA inhibitors has been studied in vitro using solution pH-stat techniques or Types I and II collagen gel diffusion systems. Three biologically relevant systems are used with these methodologies: (1) transformation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to crystalline HA; (2) direct formation of HA; and (3) growth of HA crystals. Several different mechanisms have been identified for HA inhibition. Condensed phosphates (containing P-O-P linkages) and diphosphonates (containing P-C-P linkages) bind strongly to the surface of forming HA nuclei and crystals and poison growth sites at concentrations as low as 10(-6) M, blocking HA formation. From this in vitro work, diphosphonates have been developed for the treatment of Paget's disease. Proteoglycans, found in cartilage, delay HA formation by a steric effect whereby large volumes of solution become unavailable for HA formation and growth as these enormous macromolecules tumble about. Mg ions enter the structure of forming HA nuclei by replacing Ca, resulting in a distorted atomic structure that slows subsequent growth to HA. Al ions delay HA formation, not by entering the structure of forming HA nuclei, but by adsorbing on the surface of growing HA crystals. Serum proteins slow the transformation of ACP to HA by adsorbing on the ACP surface, which decreases its dissolution rate. Metal-citrate complexes can inhibit HA formation and growth at concentrations as low as 10(-5) to 10(-6) M. Phosphorylated molecules such as acidic proline-rich phosphoproteins and statherins found in saliva suppress HA crystal growth on tooth surfaces by adsorbing on active surface sites. Future research in this field lies in the study of interactions of HA inhibitors found together in calcifying tissues.\r"

Recent advances in surgical techniques have given much more encouraging results. Coleman has played a significant role in this progress with his concept of complete correction of the tibial and fibular deformities and fixation with strong and long intramedullary rods. To this technique have been added autologous cancellous bone grafting and electrical stimulation. These advances have increased the rate of successful union of the pseudarthrosis of the tibia. More recently, transfer of a vascularized fibular graft with correction at the same time of the leg-length discrepancy has offered even greater hope for achieving successful bony union of the tibia. This treatment involves surgery on the normal leg. Long-term results of this method of management are eagerly awaited.\r"

These deformities are relatively common in infancy and childhood, generally resolve spontaneously with growth, and rarely persist into adult life. There are few situations in which treatment is necessary. (1) Rigid metatarsus adductus that does not resolve during the first six months should be corrected by casting. The long leg cast is most effective, as it controls the rotation of the tibia. With the tibia stabilized, the foot can be laterally rotated and abducted, which usually allows correction using one or two casts. (2) Persistent, severe tibial medial or lateral torsion after the age of eight years may be corrected by a supramalleolar tibial rotational osteotomy. This is indicated for medial torsion beyond 15 degrees and for lateral torsion beyond 30 degrees. Fixation is provided by crossed, smooth pins and a long leg cast. Compartment syndromes and peroneal nerve injury are avoided by the distal correction. (3) Persistent, severe femoral antetorsion of more than 50 degrees after the age of eight years may justify correction. For operative correction, medial rotation should exceed 85 degrees and lateral rotation should be less than 10 degrees. The osteotomy for correction is fixed by threaded Steinmann pins cut off below the skin and supplemented with a spica cast.\r"

Amputation is now much less common than other forms of limb reconstruction. Oncologists have come to play a much larger role than do radiotherapists. Indeed, radiotherapy is seldom used now except for its undoubted value in palliation. The development of adjuvant chemotherapy is now prolonging life, assisting the surgeon in local resection, and almost certainly increasing the chances of survival. When one considers the valuable role of thoracic surgery in lung metastectomy and the advances in pathology, imaging, and the staging of bone tumors, it can be seen there has been a revolutionary change in the care of those who suffer from primary malignancy of bone.\r"

Even after this age, treatment is not recommended unless physical and/or emotional sequelae are imminent or a thumb sucking child requests help in quitting. Thus, in most cases parents should be instructed to ignore thumb sucking. When intervention is necessary, it should be preceded by a 1-month moratorium on parental attention. Treatment should include a combination of monitoring with charts, incentives for successful days and various external cues to remind the child who forgets.\r"

Cellular immune function in vitro is frequently abnormal, as assessed by ability of T cells to proliferate in response to antigens or mitogens. Impaired humoral immunity is manifested in polyclonal B-cell activation and in impaired antibody responses to soluble antigens in vivo and in vitro. Numerous functional defects of macrophages have also been reported. The most valuable clinical laboratory tests for evaluation of the immune status of the HIV-infected individual are enumeration of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ cells and quantitation of circulating immunoglobulins. The results of these tests can help differentiate the immunosuppression caused by HIV from other causes of immunodeficiency. Helper T-cell counts are also important for selecting appropriate treatment regimens. Combinations of the results of these tests with those of virus culture or antigen detection assays provide additional prognostic information. Future research may help us recognize other patterns of immunodeficiency with specific clinical implications. It is hoped that new therapies, both antiviral and immune reconstitutive, will soon become available; at such time immunologic testing will be able to chart the return to normal immune function.\r"

Most cases are caused by yeast (predominantly Candida albicans), the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, or a specific mixture of bacteria (bacterial vaginosis). The prevalence of each of these varies with the patient population. The clinical signs used in differentiating among these and the associated bacterial flora are shown in Table 3. Because vaginitis/vaginosis cannot be adequately diagnosed solely on the basis of symptoms or physical examination, some laboratory methods are required. Yeast vaginitis is diagnosed by microscopic detection of budding yeast or pseudohyphae in vaginal secretions. The most sensitive method for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis is culture, but microscopic methods are more commonly used. Wet-mount examination for motile trichomonads is the least sensitive microscopic method. The sensitivity is increased when fluorescent monoclonal antibodies are used. Bacterial vaginosis may be diagnosed in the clinic by detecting three or more of the following on examination: (1) homogeneous adherent discharge, (2) vaginal fluid pH greater than 4.5, (3) amine odor, and (4) clue cells. A diagnosis may also be made by detecting the replacement of lactobacilli by a mixed presumably anaerobic flora. This is accomplished by examining a Gram stain of vaginal fluid. It is not uncommon for a woman to have more than one microbial source for her vaginal signs and symptoms. A vaginal examination should include appropriate tests for detection of all three of these agents.\r"

Granuloma inguinale is caused by a small, gram-negative rod, which has never been well-characterized. The presence of Donovan bodies is a specific and sensitive diagnostic characteristic.

  ".W": "The response of an individual's bone mass to exercise training will depend, in part, on their present level of functional activity and on the hormonal and nutritional milieus of bone tissue. For normally active, but not trained persons, an exercise training program may lead to a new bone mass as much as 5% to 10% above baseline. In an individual with a bone mass which is markedly reduced because of inactivity, poor nutrition, or hormonal deficiency (or excess, depending on the hormone), it is possible that exercise will result in even larger gains in bone mass. Training with weight-bearing exercises may serve as an osteogenic stimulus to both young and older individuals. If the training program is limited or restricted, however, older people may not show the same magnitude of change as do younger subjects. In women, low estrogen levels may reduce the apparent benefit from exercise training, as seen from the studies of amenorrheic athletes. Low bone mass may be related to an estrogen withdrawal effect as well as to the basic estrogen deficiency. Exercise training is likely to provide an osteogenic stimulus for the maintenance of bone mass when it is done in an environment of optimal hormonal levels and nutrition. Physical activity, however, may not be an effective substitute for estrogen therapy. Under optimal conditions, exercise training does provide an osteogenic stimulus to bone, resulting in an increase or maintenance of bone mass, when a loss might otherwise be expected. It is not realistic, however, to expect that exercise training will bring about a large increase in bone mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were treated 12 +/- 2 h (SEM) after the onset of shock, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 63 +/- 3 mm Hg. All patients had clinical evidence of an infectious process and required dopamine 20 +/- 2 micrograms/kg.min. Five (46%) of 11 patients in the naloxone group and one (9%) of the other 11 patients in the placebo group responded clinically. The MAP among the five responders increased from 62 +/- 5 to 89 +/- 4 mm Hg within 20 min of naloxone treatment (p less than .01). This favorable hemodynamic response was sustained throughout the patients' clinical course. In contrast, the MAP did not change significantly in the nonresponders who received naloxone, nor did it change in the placebo group. More patients in the naloxone group than in the placebo group received steroids concurrently. Survival rate was 100% in those who responded to naloxone clinically. However, overall survival rate in each group was essentially the same. No adverse effects were observed, except for mild agitation in some of the patients receiving naloxone. We conclude that naloxone infusion is clinically efficacious in improving the hemodynamic profile of a subgroup of patients with severe early hyperdynamic septic shock, but does not appear to improve the overall survival rate.\r"

This study was designed to find rational strategies to regulate oxygenation and alveolar ventilation at HFJV and to determine appropriate monitoring methods. Seven dogs were subjected to total lung lavage with saline to induce RDS. PEEP was increased at conventional intermittent positive-pressure ventilation until re-expansion was indicated by a PaO2 of 300 torr at an FIO2 of 1.0 HFJV at 4 and 15 Hz was each tried at 0 and 10 cm H2O PEEP. Intermittent low-frequency inflations were also added to HFJV at 0 PEEP. Lung expansion was maintained without circulatory depression by adjustment of minute ventilation (VE) delivered by the HFJ ventilator; external PEEP was a useful complement. PaCO2 was controlled by frequency adjustment. HFJV at 4 Hz resulted in hypocapnia; intermittent low-frequency inflations had no effect. VE monitoring, CO2 elimination monitoring, and PEEP adjustment was done with a standard ventilator during HFJV. This study illustrates that HFJV is efficient in RDS; VE and external PEEP strongly influence oxygenation and may be used to regulate this factor, and frequency affects CO2 elimination, thus suggesting a method of PaCO2 control.\r"

Laboratory simulation using N2 and CO2 injections resulted in a mean error of 2 +/- 2% in CO2 production (VCO2) and 4 +/- 4% in oxygen consumption (VO2) in respirator measurements (n = 55) and in a mean error of 3 +/- 2% in VCO2 and 4 +/- 2% in VO2 in canopy measurements (n = 25). The mean error in RQ during ethanol burning was 2 +/- 2% in respirator measurements (n = 45) and 1 +/- 1% in canopy measurements. FIO2 had little effect on the accuracy of VCO2, whereas the accuracy on high rates of VO2 (VO2 = 400 ml/min) was reduced, when FIO2 increased: the error ranged from 1 +/- 1% to 6 +/- 1%, except at VO2 400 ml/min during FIO2 0.8, where the error was 16 +/- 3%. Neither peak airway pressure (+13 to +63 cm H2O) nor PEEP (0 to +20 cm H2O) had an effect on the accuracy. The highest level of minute ventilation studied (22.5 L/min) reduced the accuracy slightly (mean error of VCO2 4 +/- 1% and VO2 7 +/- 2%). In patients during controlled mechanical ventilation, increasing FIO2 from 0.4 to 0.6 had no effect on the results. VO2 was consistently higher by gas exchange than by the Fick principle: 16 +/- 9% during controlled ventilation (n = 20), 21 +/- 8% on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (n = 10) and 25 +/- 8% during spontaneous breathing. We conclude that the device proved to be accurate for gas exchange measurements in the ICU.\r"

Patients were assigned randomly to either method; 12 h later each group was transferred to the other method. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) was followed with the Train-of-Four method. Cardiopulmonary variables were followed hourly. The total dosage/kg body weight was calculated for each method. Six patients were started with continuous drip and the other six with hourly boluses. There were no significant differences in the cardiopulmonary variables through the two periods, although statistically there was a significant difference in the total dosage/kg body weight required for each method. The mean of total vecuronium used in the drip was 0.79 mg/kg.12 h (range 0.1 to 1.8). The mean of the hourly boluses was 1.34 mg/kg.12 h (range 1.0 to 2.55).

A modified CF system, the flow-by (FB) system, operates with preset base-flow (BF) values between 5 and 20 L/min. The DF depends on changes in pressure for opening the pneumatic valve of the system (pressure sensitivity). In contrast, the FB depends on changes in flow (flow sensitivity). In six healthy male subjects, we determined the mechanical inspiratory work of breathing (WI, J/L) and the inspiratory work rate (J/min) on the DF and the FB systems at a BF of 5 and 20 L/min, at CPAP levels of 0, 5, and 10 cm H2O. In comparison to DF, on the FB system both WI and inspiratory work rate were significantly less at a CPAP of 10 cm H2O (p less than .01). This was most likely due to the smaller drop in airway pressure at the onset of inspiration with the FB system. Varying the BF values in the FB system had no effect on WI or inspiratory work rate.\r"

  ".W": "This study explores the value of combined high-frequency ventilation (CHFV) in a prospective clinical trial of 35 patients suffering from severe post-traumatic and/or septic adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were refractory to conventional controlled mechanical ventilatory (CMV) support. The severity of ARDS was quantified by lung mechanics and gas exchange variables and the patients were classified on clinical grounds as well as on the basis of their respiratory index/pulmonary shunt relationship [RI/(Qsp/Qt)]. During the same time period as the CHFV study, data from these patients were compared to those from 88 ARDS patients who had quantitatively similar degrees of respiratory insufficiency, but who were treated only with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). The use of CHFV in the 35 CMV refractory patients resulted in an increase in expired tidal volume (VTE) by reducing the CMV inspired tidal volume (VTI) while increasing the volume component derived from high-frequency ventilation (HFV). This procedure appeared to reveal potentially salvageable ARDS patients who were refractory to CMV. In these patients, CHFV significantly reduced pulmonary mean airway pressure (Paw). The RI also decreased significantly and it was possible to reduce significantly the FIO2. In surviving ARDS patients treated with CHFV, an improvement in blood gases at reduced FIO2, without decreased cardiac output, was produced. The CHFV technique was used for less than or equal to 25 days and resulted in 23% survival of patients who were clinically and physiologically indistinguishable from the patients in the ARDS nonsurvivor group who were treated by CMV only. In surviving CHFV patients the decrease in Paw permitted a sustained, or increased, cardiac output with a rise in the oxygen delivery/oxygen consumption ratio, thus allowing for a higher PaO2 for any given level of pulmonary shunt.\r"

Despite this abundance of information, no summary article has analyzed the species variations in circulating catecholamine concentrations. In this paper, the plasma catecholamine responses to various stresses in 31 animal groups have been compiled from greater than 200 publications (with greater than 5000 animal subjects). Primitive cartilaginous fish such as the shark and the lamprey have the highest reported basal plasma catecholamine concentrations. Birds, mammals, and teleost fish have the lowest concentrations. The lower circulating catecholamine concentrations parallel anatomical changes in the development of the adrenal medulla and the development of the nervous system. Decapitation, hypoxia, hemorrhage, and hypothermia are the experimental conditions associated with the greatest stress-induced changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations. The differences in experimental design are tabulated to afford the reader an opportunity to compare catecholamine levels among species. The table provides a detailed guide to normal concentrations and normal responses in 31 species. This report gives a dynamic overview of catecholamine concentrations in human and animal physiology and may be particularly helpful to investigators involved in catecholamine research.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of endogenous opioids on the exercise capacity and control of breathing in patients with COPD. We hypothesized that naloxone, an opioid antagonist, would block the endogenous endorphins and decrease the exercise capacity of our patients. Six patients (mean age, 58.8 +/- 3.2 years) with COPD (mean FEV1, 1.28 +/- 0.46 L) underwent identical incremental cycle ergometer tests to exhaustion (Emax) and assessment of their hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses and mouth occlusion pressure responses following the IV administration of naloxone (0.4 mg/kg) (N) or placebo (P) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Perceived dyspnea (modified Borg scale), breathing patterns, and expired gas levels were compared at rest and at maximal workload (WL). There was no significant difference after N compared with after P in the WL or the duration of work. At Emax there were no significant differences after N compared with after P in ventilation, the level of dyspnea, P0.1, VO2, or VCO2. The ventilatory response to CO2 production during exercise (delta VE/delta VCO2) and the ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia did not differ significantly after N compared with after P. This study does not support the hypothesis that endogenous opioids play a significant role in dampening dyspnea and facilitating exercise in patients with COPD.\r"

The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was not different at the time of diagnosis of ARDS in those patients who lived compared to those who subsequently died. After one day of conventional therapy including PEEP, those patients who survived increased their PaO2/FIO2 ratio. The nonsurvivors did not improve over a seven-day course. The difference in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio was significant throughout the seven-day observation period.

The VO2 and EE can be used to estimate changes in the work of breathing (WOB) associated with different weaning strategies. The purpose of this study was to use VO2 and EE to assess changes in the WOB when assisted mechanical ventilation (AMV) was replaced with two spontaneous ventilatory trial (SVT) techniques: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and T-piece. Nine difficult-to-wean patients were studied during the initial weaning period following 26 +/- 18 days (mean +/- SD) of mechanical ventilatory support. The VO2 and EE during all AMV were 296 +/- 75 ml/min and 2069 +/- 519 kcal/day, respectively. Compared to the baseline AMV levels, during CPAP overall VO2 and EE increased 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively, and during T-piece overall VO2 and EE increased 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Respiration rate (f) increased and tidal volume (VT) decreased during both SVTs compared to AMV although no significant change in minute ventilation was seen. The WOB, as judged from changes in VO2, was only 5 percent higher during T-piece compared to CPAP; however, patients tolerated an average of only 141 +/- 45 min on T-piece vs 165 +/- 29 minutes on CPAP. We conclude that during the initial weaning stages in patients who have received prolonged mechanical ventilatory support, the WOB associated with SVTs is increased compared to AMV but that the WOB associated with T-piece is not significantly greater than that for CPAP.\r"

It allows direct inspection of proximal airways and can establish the location of most occult lung cancers. A small percentage of patients present with bronchoscopically as well as radiographically occult carcinoma, particularly challenging because definitive localizations is required before a therapeutic plan can be outlined. Selective cytologic brushing of each lobar segment, taking random biopsy specimens, has been used to assist in localization of these early cancers. Recently, fluorescent compounds have been used to assist in localizing early lung cancers and in the treatment of radiographically occult carcinoma. We review the current methods of bronchoscopic localization and treatment of radiographically occult lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP), total white blood cell (WBC) count, total neutrophil count, and neutrophil differential count were evaluated in a prospective blinded study of 204 patients submitted with the tentative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The laboratory tests were performed on blood samples obtained at the time of admission, and the results were stored until the patients were discharged. One hundred patients were operated on: 59 had appendicitis, 3 had other surgically correctable diseases, and 38 had a superfluous exploration. All 104 nonoperated patients recovered spontaneously. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of single tests and test combinations were calculated at different cutoff levels. Using standard reference intervals, WBC count demonstrated the best sensitivity (83 percent) and predictive value of a negative result (88 percent). Combining the tests by an \"or\" rule enhanced the sensitivity to 100 percent, employing WBC count or CRP or neutrophil percentage above the reference range (triple test), but at the expense of the predictive value of a positive test (37 percent). It was concluded that both single tests and combined tests are of limited value in predicting acute appendicitis. However, the same triple test combination proved a predictive value of a negative result at 100 percent (95 percent confidence limits 92 to 100 percent), indicating that acute appendicitis is unlikely when these tests are simultaneously negative. The triple test combination was valid in 32 percent of the patients who were free from appendicitis. In the study group, 10 of the patients (25 percent) who had a superfluous exploration had a negative triple test, and they might have avoided surgery if it had been used. Therefore, the triple test is recommended as a help in reducing the significant rate of negative laparotomies in patients suspected of having acute appendicitis.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 30 percent of patients undergoing anorectal surgery will develop acute urinary retention. The cause of this complication is poorly understood. Anxiety, anal distention, bladder distention as a result of vigorous hydration during surgery, and reflex inhibition of the urinary bladder detrusor muscle secondary to pain have been postulated as contributing factors. A four-armed prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was carried out to determine whether an anxiolytic agent (midazolam, 5 mg intramuscularly) and/or a parasympathomimetic agent (bethanechol, 10 mg subcutaneously) reduce the incidence of postoperative urinary retention following anorectal surgery. One hundred thirty-two patients (ages, 18 to 50 years), in acute urinary retention 6 to 12 hours following anorectal surgery, were enrolled. Sixty-nine percent of patients responded to bethanechol. Side effects were minimal. Midazolam alone had no effect on retention. Bethanechol and midazolam in combination resulted in less retention than midazolam and a placebo (P less than 0.05). Bethanechol alone was better than a placebo (P less than 0.002). Mean intraoperative intravenous fluid volume for the entire study group was 900 cc. Initial postoperative urinary volumes of patients who failed the treatment protocol were significantly higher than in those responding to bethanechol (mean of 527 cc vs. 241 cc, P less than 0.001). The use of an anxiolytic agent was not effective in the treatment of postoperative urinary retention. Bladder distention may increase the incidence of urinary retention. Bethanechol, in a dose of 10 mg subcutaneously, significantly lowered the incidence of postoperative urinary catheterization and should be considered as initial treatment of postoperative urinary retention following anorectal surgery.\r"

The authors present the ultrasonic characteristics of rectal leiomyoma by means of endorectal ultrasound, a method which, although not definitive, does delimit and orient the diagnosis in regard to the rectal mass and the follow-up of these tumors. A histologic diagnosis constitutes a dilemma between benign and malignant forms. The authors believe that treatment should always be surgical, realizing local extirpation when the histologic study reveals no signs of malignancy; even though it is mandatory to perform regular follow-up checkups (mainly with endorectal ultrasound) and radical treatment in regard to malignant lesions and local relapse of the anterior forms.\r"

Cases were gathered from 11 surgical practices throughout North America, in which the ileoanal reservoir procedure is frequently performed. Overall, 304 females had undergone ileoanal reservoir procedures by these surgical groups. Twenty-one patients developed 22 pouch vaginal fistulas for an overall incidence of 6.9 percent. Five additional patients with pouch vaginal fistulas, whose restorative proctocolectomies were done elsewhere, were referred to these surgeons for treatment. The courses of these 26 patients form the basis of this report. This study details the risk factors which predispose in the development of a pouch vaginal fistula, as well as the various treatment options available.\r"

Two hundred sixteen patients undergoing colonic resection and anastomosis were studied. Patients were randomized to receive either aprotinin or placebo intravenously, peroperatively, and for the first three postoperative days. Anastomotic integrity was assessed clinically and by Hypaque enema on the tenth postoperative day. Although the use of aprotinin was not associated with a significant overall decrease in anastomotic leakage rates, in 95 patients undergoing anterior resection, leakage rates in those receiving aprotinin (clinical 10.8 percent; radiologic 32.4 percent) were lower than in those receiving placebo (17.2 percent and 43.1 percent, respectively). An apparent adverse association was noted, however, in patients undergoing left hemicolectomy or sigmoid colectomy who received aprotinin.\r"

All of the tissues studied were obtained at time of liver transplantation. In addition the livers of 5 adults biopsied for hepatomegaly but found to have no histologic liver disease were used as normal controls for this study. The results demonstrate that liver tissue obtained from children with end-stage biliary atresia is more like normal liver in terms of the number and type of mononuclear cells present than in either of the two types of adult liver diseases. Moreover although the liver of children with end-stage alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is more like that of normal liver than either of the two adult liver diseases studied in terms of the number and type of mononuclear cells within the liver, it is less similar to that of normal adult liver than is liver tissue obtained from children with biliary atresia. These findings suggest that as a morphologic basis biliary atresia is unlikely to be due to either a viral or an autoimmune attack upon the liver.\r"

However, numerous patients still produce antibody levels that may alter insulin pharmacokinetics, leading to higher postprandial blood glucose levels and to an increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia. Although the effects of antibodies on long-term glycemic control are less clear, the metabolic consequences of altered pharmacokinetics are clinically evident in patients in whom near normoglycemia is the goal and who are treated predominantly with short-acting insulin. Lipoatrophy and immunological insulin resistance, which are also antibody-induced phenomena, have become rare. Whether pregnancies in diabetic mothers with antibodies carry an increased risk for serious or fatal complications is not clear; neonates of these mothers are probably at increased risk for neonatal hypoglycemia.\r"

We suggest that in controlled clinical trials, a mean change of 2 points on the neurologic disability score is clinically detectable and meaningful. Based on our previously published cross-sectional epidemiological data, this corresponds to a change of motor nerve conduction velocity of the average ulnar median and peroneal nerves of 2.9 m/s and peroneal nerve of 2.2 m/s. The corresponding changes of amplitude were 1.2 and 0.7 mV, respectively. Smaller degrees of nerve conduction change were found when only insulin-dependent patients were evaluated.\r"

As a group, the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are diseases that are very responsive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. There are major differences, however, in the durability of these responses. From a clinical standpoint, the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may be divided into those that are indolent and those that are aggressive in their clinical behavior. Ironically, the aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are frequently curable, while the indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are presently incurable in the majority of cases.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has potent PRL-releasing activity, but its physiological role in the regulation of PRL release during the avian reproductive cycle is not known. We used indirect immunofluorescence to determine if changes in hypothalamic VIP are associated with the shifts in circulating PRL during the reproductive cycle of the domestic turkey. In the naturally hyperprolactinemic incubating hen, the majority of VIP immunoreactivity (VIP-IR) existed within neurons of the infundibular nuclear complex (INF) and fibers in the external layer of the median eminence. Within the INF, the numbers of VIP-IR cells increased during the cycle, paralleling increases in serum PRL. In the reproductively inactive, nonphotostimulated hen with low serum PRL, essentially no positive cells were noted, whereas the incubating hen exhibited 32.1 +/- 2.2 cells/pair of adjacent sections in the anterior INF and 59.6 +/- 2.0 cells in the posterior INF. Exposure of inactive hens to a stimulatory photoperiod resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in serum PRL with the appearance of VIP-IR cells in the INF. During laying and incubation, further increases were observed in the number of positive cells in the INF and serum PRL as well as a greater fiber density in the median eminence. To further examine the association between changes in VIP-IR and serum PRL, circulating PRL was artificially lowered by depriving incubating hens of their nests for 0, 2, 5, and 10 days. On day 2 of nest deprivation, serum PRL declined markedly to 12% of day 0 levels, with VIP-IR cell numbers at 64% and 46% in the anterior and posterior INF, respectively. By day 10, birds exhibited cell numbers in the INF averaging 20% of those observed in the day 0 incubating hens, with serum PRL at 6% of day 0 levels. The results of these studies indicate a possible causal relationship between hypothalamic VIP and changes in PRL secretion during the avian reproductive cycle, providing a basis for further research on the importance of this peptide as well as factors responsible for the modulation of its expression in hypothalamic INF neurons.\r"

  ".W": "After our previous report that osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNCs) were formed in response to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3] in cocultures of mouse spleen cells and osteoblast-rich populations freshly isolated from fetal mouse calvariae, we examined whether such primary osteoblast-like cells can be replaced by established cell lines in inducing osteoclast-like cell formation. We first used two clonal cell lines simultaneously established from newborn mouse calvariae. One was the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, and the other was the preadipose cell line MC3T3-G2/PA6. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP; a marker enzyme of osteoclasts)-positive mononuclear cells and MNCs were formed in the cocultures of spleen cells and MC3T3-G2/PA6 cells in the presence of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. Dexamethasone greatly potentiated TRACP-positive MNC formation induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, whereas the glucocorticoid alone had no effect on it. In contrast, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells failed to induce TRACP-positive cells in the cocultures. Another bone marrow-derived stromal cell line ST2 also induced TRACP-positive MNC formation in the cocultures in response to 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 and dexamethasone. Salmon calcitonin enhanced cAMP production in the cocultures only when TRACP-positive cells were formed. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that [125I]calcitonin specifically bound to TRACP-positive cells formed in the cocultures. When spleen cells and either MC3T3-G2/PA6 or ST2 cells were cocultured on sperm whale dentine slices in the presence of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 and dexamethasone, numerous resorption lacunae were formed. These results show that the two bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines can support osteoclast-like cell differentiation in cocultures with spleen cells.\r"

  ".U": "90005128\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins are produced by several cell types, including vascular endothelial cells. The production of IGF-binding proteins by endothelial cells is of particular interest, since these cells are directly bathed by the circulating IGFs and form the initial barrier to the passage of circulating IGFs from the bloodstream to subendothelial tissues. We have purified IGF-binding proteins from medium conditioned by cultured bovine endothelial cells by sequential passage over Bio-Gel P-60, multiplication-stimulating activity affinity, anion exchange (DEAE cellulose) and/or hydrophobic (phenyl-Sepharose) chromatography. Two peaks of IGF-binding activity were eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column. After cross-linking, each peak contained two to five protein bands on gels that specifically bound IGF-I and -II with mol wt ranging from about 28-44K. Material in peak 1 bound IGF-I congruent to IGF-II and had no affinity for insulin and proinsulin. Peak 2 IGF-binding proteins bound IGF-II with substantially higher affinity than IGF-I and did not recognize insulin or proinsulin. Peak 1 material from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was a potent stimulator of both glucose transport and aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake in microvessel endothelial cells, with maximal stimulation of both processes being 300-400% of control values. In contrast, peak 2 material either had no intrinsic bioactivity or was slightly inhibitory or stimulatory, depending on the concentration of peak 2 material that was added. The bioactivity in peak 1 was not due to copurification of other endothelial proteins capable of stimulating glucose and AIB uptake, such as IGF-I/-II, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor, since bioactivity was retained after acid treatment, antibody neutralization, and selective affinity chromatography to deplete these other factors. When peak 1 material was added to IGF-I the bioeffects (glucose and AIB uptake) of IGF and binding proteins were additive, and in some experiments the binding proteins potentiated the effect of IGF on endothelial cells, suggesting that the binding protein-IGF complex may retain the bioactivity of both the binding protein(s) and the IGF.\r"

Immunostaining of alpha-subunit was present in the seminiferous epithelium of fetal, neonatal, pubertal, and adult rats as well as in Sertoli cells in culture. The distribution of inhibin beta-B-subunit immunostaining in this epithelium was consistent with Sertoli cell localization similar to that of the alpha-subunit. The predominant staining with antibodies against the beta-A-subunit was in nuclei of immature germ cells around the periphery of each seminiferous tubule. The most probable localization of this staining was in the nuclei of pachytene and zygotene spermatocytes. Specific immunostaining with beta-A-subunit antiserum was also evident in the seminiferous epithelium adjacent to the tubular lumen. Immunoreactive alpha- and beta-A-subunit staining was present in a Leydig cell line, and beta-A immunoreactivity was present in interstitial cells of neonatal rat testes. After hypophysectomy, inhibin alpha-subunit immunostaining decreased, beta-A-subunit staining did not change, and beta-B-subunit staining increased. We conclude that immunoreactive inhibin subunits are present in multiple cells in the testis and that the amounts of immunostainable subunits in the seminiferous epithelium are differentially regulated.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we describe the development and characterization of a long term culture system to study regulation of the expression of 17 alpha-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage, and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in human theca interna cells. Conditions have been established for the dispersal, growth, freezing, and storage of functional human theca interna cells isolated from preovulatory follicles of women undergoing laparoscopy for gamete intrafallopian tube transfer and in vitro fertilization procedures. Theca interna cells grown under these conditions have a doubling rate of 28-32 h and are morphologically distinct from human granulosa cells grown under the same conditions. Theca interna cells were grown, passed for successive passages, and transferred into serum-free medium containing forskolin, hCG, LH, or cAMP analogs. There was a time- and dose-dependent increase in 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and progesterone synthesis from endogenous precursors. Added pregnenolone was converted to 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, which was further converted primarily to dehydroepiandrosterone and, to a much lesser extent, androstenedione. Progesterone was converted to 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 16 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. In studies using 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone as substrate, no metabolism to androstenedione or any other product was detectable. Similarly, 4-pregnen-20 alpha-ol-one (20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone) was not metabolized to any detectable products. Northern analysis performed on total RNA obtained from forskolin-stimulated theca interna cultures verified that the increase in 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity was associated with a corresponding increase in levels of mRNA specific for 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450. Message levels for cholesterol side-chain cleavage P-450 were similarly increased in cells treated with forskolin. No detectable mRNA encoding aromatase cytochrome P-450 was discerned. This procedure for the preparation and study of proliferating human theca internal cells provides an opportunity to study regulation of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and other cellular processes unique to human ovarian cells.\r"

  ".W": "A cleaved form of rat PRL (cldPRL), which resolves after reduction of the disulfide bonds into two fragments of 16K and 8K mol wt, has been reported in the pituitary gland. To further understand the genesis of this cleaved PRL and its related 16K fragment (cldPRL/16K), pituitary proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine and then dialyzed and lyophilized before sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pulse-chase experiments did not show a precursor-product relationship between PRL and cldPRL. However, if proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid instead of dialysis, no cldPRL/16K was observed. Other experiments demonstrated that during dialysis cldPRL/16K is generated in vitro at the expense of intact PRL in a time-dependent manner. Labeled proteins dialyzed against water previously adjusted to different pHs showed after electrophoresis that cldPRL/16K was generated only at acidic pH. In the presence of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, tosylamidelysyl chloromethylketone, or tosylphenylalanine chloromethylketone or when the incubation medium was heated at 65 C for 45 min, the acid pH was unable to generate cldPRL/16K. Trypsin inhibitors did not prevent cldPRL generation. In conclusion, an acid protease, possibly of lysosomal origin, cleaves PRL in vitro. cldPRL/16K form was not found in the pituitary or incubation medium under physiological conditions. This PRL variant is generated as a preparative artifact unless experimental conditions are controlled.\r"

  ".U": "90005138\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the postulated phenomenon of glucotoxicity toward the B-cell, islets isolated from normal adult rats were cultured for 1-6 days in RPMI medium at various glucose concentrations. Insulin release and (pro)insulin biosynthesis by these islets were then measured in short term incubations. The 1-day cultured islets (at 9.7 mM glucose) displayed a deficient glucose-stimulated insulin release which was partially restored in the presence of forskolin (5 microM). By contrast they exhibited a consistent insulin release in response to ketoisocaproate (10 mM), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (2 microM), or the combination of Ba2+ (2 mM) and theophylline (1.4 mM) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Desensitization of their B-cells was not specific for glucose, since glyceraldehyde (10 mM) or leucine (10 mM) also failed to stimulate insulin release. Desensitization was not related to glucose concentration (5.6, 9.7, or 16.7 mM) in the medium during the 1-day culture period and was restricted to the secretory function, with no impairment of the biosynthesis process. The desensitization to glucose was transient, and high glucose levels (9.7 and 16.7 mM) in the culture medium favored restoration of the subsequent secretory response to the hexose. Under conditions of recovery of B-cell sensitivity to glucose in vitro (5 days at 9.7 mM glucose), the secretory response to acute glucose was in fact significantly enhanced after an additional exposure (1 day) to very high glucose levels (22 or 55 mM). The present results argue against 1) the possibility that islets suffer from some unspecific decreased viability after a 1-day culture period; and 2) the hypothesis that glucose insensitivity in the 1-day cultured islets is primarily caused by a direct deleterious effect of high glucose concentrations on the B-cells. They, rather, reinforce the view that high glucose levels are actually crucial in the preservation of the insulin secretory response to glucose of islets maintained in tissue culture.\r"

High glucose and potassium (K+) depolarization were employed as the stimulant of insulin release. omega CgTX (greater than 50 nM), a blocker of neural, but not muscular, Ca2+ channels, partially blocked (27%) the second, but not the first, phase of glucose-induced insulin release without a significant effect on K+ depolarization-induced insulin release. The DHP Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine inhibited both phases of glucose-induced insulin release (ED50 = 200 nM) and completely abolished both phases of response at 10 microM. In contrast, the DHP Ca2+ channel blocker only partially suppressed (75% at 10 microM) K+ depolarization-induced insulin release with an ED50 of 100 nM. We conclude that pancreatic B-cell possesses at least two classes of VDCCs; one is DHP sensitive, and the other DHP insensitive. Partial suppression of the second phase of glucose-induced insulin release by a high concentration of omega CgTX may be due to its toxic effect on the secretory machinery other than VDCC.\r"

  ".U": "90005143\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the cellular basis for growth hormone deficiency in Lewis-derived dwarf rats. To this end, we used reverse hemolytic plaque assays to evaluate hormone release. This allowed us to determine the proportional abundance of GH- and PRL- secreting cells and estimate the relative amount of hormone secreted by individual pituitary cells from dwarf rats and their somatically normal counterparts. The percentage of all pituitary cells that released GH (formed plaques) in pituitary dispersions was substantially lower for dwarfs when compared with normals in the absence (3.8 +/- 2.2% vs. 43.4 +/- 2.2%) or presence (6.6 +/- 3.8% vs. 45.7 +/- 1.4%; n = 3) of GRF. In addition, GH secretors from dwarfs released less hormone (formed smaller plaques) than their normal counterparts under both basal and stimulated conditions. An analysis of the relative number of GH cells that formed plaques of various sizes was accomplished by constructing a frequency distribution. Dwarf GH secretors formed more small plaques and proportionately fewer larger plaques than normals under both basal and stimulated conditions. For comparison, we also quantified the proportions of PRL secretors and found that they were actually more abundant in dwarfs than normals in the absence (52.4 +/- 4.6% vs. 33.7 +/- 3.7%) or presence (53.4 +/- 4.9% vs. 33.8 +/- 4.1%; n = 4) of TRH. Treatment with this secretagogue consistently increased mean PRL-plaque area for both groups. Our findings demonstrate that dwarf rats are severely deficient in the proportion of GH secretors. In addition, the few GH secretors present in the dwarf pituitary were less responsive to GRF than normals. In contrast, PRL cells in dwarfs appear to be functionally similar to those of their normal counterparts. The reciprocal relationship in the proportions of GH and PRL secretors in dwarfs provides a rather unique model for investigating the functional relationship between these cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Relaxin is a member of the insulin-like growth factor family that functions primarily during pregnancy and parturition. Because previous studies have shown that rat adipocytes respond to relaxin, we undertook this study to investigate the effect of relaxin on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts in cell culture. First, relaxin prevented the normal course of cell division during the induction phase, but did not interfere with expression of the adipocyte phenotype, as indicated by lipid accumulation and insulin-sensitive glucose transport. Relaxin-treated cells were 2-3 times larger than cells induced by the normal procedure, as determined by both computer-assisted size analysis and intracellular water volume. These effects on cell division and cell size could be reversed by removal of relaxin during early induction. The concentration of relaxin required to elicit the half-maximal effect was 75 ng/ml (12.5 nM). These studies demonstrate that relaxin affects the proliferative response during the inductive phase of differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cell line without affecting differentiation directly. This effect of relaxin on proliferation is unique and is discussed in relation to the cell cycle. It is our hope that these cells will serve as a model system for investigating the mechanisms by which relaxin functions and allow further studies on receptor structure and function.\r"

  ".U": "90005150\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous reports have appeared in the literature indicating phenotypic heterogeneity among cells of the osteoblastic lineage. This diversity may be due to either certain stages of differentiation or a subspecialization of already terminally differentiated osteoblasts. To obtain answers to this question, we report on studies undertaken to clone bone cell populations from 1 day postnatal rat calvaria which express well defined differences in phenotype. To achieve this goal, we have used the soft agarose cloning technique which previously has almost exclusively been applied to clone cells of neoplastic origin. The reason for being able to employ this method is based on the fact that bone cells can be induced by transforming growth factor-beta to reversibly acquire the transformed phenotype, an event expressed by anchorage-dependent bone cells to form progressively growing colonies in soft agarose. Individual colonies, harvested from agarose, were expanded to clonal bone cell populations. Characterizing 48 cell clones by detection of osteoblastic cell markers such as alkaline phosphatase activity, PTH- and prostaglandin-E2-induced adenylate cyclase activity, osteocalcin mRNA synthesis, as well as collagen synthesis, 7 subsets of osteoblastic cell types were identified. Each subset was found to express a distinct phenotype, indicated by the absence or presence of osteoblastic cell markers. Some clones, previously found not to exhibit any osteoblastic traits, developed PTH responsiveness when treated with insulin-like growth factor-I/transforming growth factor-beta, suggesting that these clones may originate from the osteoprogenitor cell pool. While most clonal cell populations were characterized as fully functional osteoblastic cells, some clones expressed merely 1, 2, or 3 osteoblastic markers, which suggests that they may represent stages of differentiation along the osteogenic pathway. In addition, other subclones displayed the capacity to synthesize osteocalcin and showed PTH and prostaglandin-E2 responsiveness, but were found to be devoid of alkaline phosphatase activity. Others expressed all osteoblastic cell markers except PTH responsiveness. The phenotypic constellation of the latter suggests that these cell clones may represent mature osteoblast-like cells, which, perhaps due to environmental circumstances present at the time of isolation, have become altered in accordance with the physiological requirements of the tissue.\r"

Because pregnant diabetic women are reported to have higher serum progesterone levels than nondiabetic pregnant women, we studied the roles of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in the regulation of human cytotrophoblastic 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) activity. Incubation of cytotrophoblasts with insulin or IGF-I for 24 h significantly increased the ability of these cells to convert pregnenolone to progesterone by 75.8 +/- 16.5% (+/- SE) and 65.4 +/- 12.7%, respectively. Treatment with either insulin or IGF-I did not alter cytotrophoblastic production of 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one (the primary metabolite of progesterone), thus demonstrating that these peptides increased progesterone synthesis (i.e. 3 beta HSD activity) rather than decreased progesterone catabolism. Insulin and IGF-I stimulated 3 beta HSD activity at concentrations as low as 50 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated 3 beta HSD activities were completely inhibited by concurrent treatment with either actinomycin-D or cycloheximide, suggesting that new mRNA and protein synthesis are required for these peptides to exert their effects. Blockade of the IGF-I receptor of cytotrophoblasts with alpha IR-3, a monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody, prevented the stimulation of 3 beta HSD activity by IGF-I, but did not alter insulin's stimulatory effect. Thus, the two hormones can each stimulate 3 beta HSD activity via activation of their respective receptors. These studies indicate that insulin and IGF-I can regulate human cytotrophoblastic 3 beta HSD activity in vitro. Since pregnant diabetic women manifest peripheral hyperinsulinemia, and IGF-I levels in fetal cord sera from diabetic pregnancies may be elevated, these observations may help explain the elevated serum progesterone levels associated with pregnancy in the diabetic patient.\r"

The specific binding of [125I] human (h) GH to total particulate fractions from 18 livers varied from 0.4-5.1% of the total radioactivity/100 micrograms protein. Binding affinity was 2.0 +/- 0.3 X 10(9) M-1, and binding capacity ranged from 14-53 fmol/mg protein. A different proportion of receptors occupied by endogenous hGH did not explain the large variation in binding. Binding sites were specific for hGH. Dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex was extremely slow. No specific binding of [125I]hPRL was observed. Specific binding of insulin was found in fractions from all livers and varied less than hGH binding. Cross-linking of [125I]hGH to plasma membrane and microsome receptors yielded two major autoradiographic bands corresponding to an estimated mol wt of 103,000 for the receptor, with a possible subunit of 54,000. Human liver primary fractions were characterized. The binding of hGH and insulin displayed a nucleo-microsomal distribution pattern in the primary fractions; 54.2% and 27.9% of the hGH-binding activity were found in the microsomes and the nuclear fraction, respectively, whereas insulin binds equally to nuclear and microsomal elements. Our findings suggest that hGH-binding sites are present in the plasma membrane and also in one or more intracellular compartments, whereas a high proportion of insulin receptors is associated with the plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH peptides in the hypothalami of marsupials (tammar wallaby, short-nosed bandicoot, and eastern quoll) and a monotreme (echidna) were investigated by reverse phase HPLC and RIA with region-specific antisera. In the wallaby hypothalamic extract, a single form of GnRH was present, which eluted in the same position as synthetic mammalian GnRH on HPLC and was recognized by antibodies directed against the NH2- and COOH-termini of mammalian GnRH as well as by antibodies to the middle region. Two GnRH molecular forms were demonstrated in the bandicoot and quoll hypothalamic extracts. One form eluted in the same position as synthetic mammalian GnRH on HPLC and was quantified equally by two mammalian GnRH antisera. The second form eluted in the same position as synthetic chicken GnRH II and was recognized by specific antibodies to this molecule. Quantification of this immunoreactive peak with two chicken GnRH II antisera was not equal, suggesting that the peptide has similar properties to, but may not be identical to, chicken GnRH II. Immunoreactive GnRH was also detected in the echidna hypothalamic extract. These findings demonstrate that in some mammals more than one form of GnRH is present in the brain of a single species, as has previously been found in species from all nonmammalian vertebrate classes. The finding in marsupial brain of a peptide with properties of chicken GnRH II, which has previously been reported in species of Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, Osteichthyes, and Chondrichthyes, supports our hypothesis that this widespread structural variant may represent an early early evolved and conserved form of GnRH.\r"

In fetal sheep AVP is an important stress hormone and may be simultaneously secreted with OT; however, their effects on IRG secretion are not known. We sought to determine if AVP and/or OT affected pancreatic IRG secretion in fetal and neonatal sheep. Either AVP or OT was infused for 30 min in chronically catheterized fetal and neonatal sheep, obtaining peripheral arterial and/or portal venous blood samples before; 10, 15, and 30 min during; and 15, 30, and 60 min after infusion for measurements of blood gases, hematocrit, IRG, immunoreactive plasma insulin (IRI) and plasma glucose. AVP did not affect IRG or IRI in fetal sheep (mean +/- SE, 133 +/- 1 days gestation), but small increases occurred in portal venous blood of lambs (2-49 days old). In contrast, OT (4.6 +/- 0.3 mU/min.kg; n = 12) increased fetal plasma IRG from 72 +/- 5 to 86 +/- 6 and 97 +/- 7 pg/ml (P less than 0.001) and IRI from 16 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 3 and 20 +/- 2 microU/ml (P less than 0.02) at 15 and 30 min, respectively; 157 +/- 11 microU OT/min.kg had no effect. In lambs (2-49 days old), 3.0 mU OT/min.kg increased arterial (n = 15) IRG from 139 +/- 19 to 367 +/- 43 and 483 +/- 76 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) and portal IRG (n = 8) from 167 +/- 39 to 341 +/- 72 and 502 +/- 148 pg/ml (P less than 0.01), respectively. Arterial and portal IRI also rose (P less than 0.01) from 36 +/- 4 to 82 +/- 12 and 105 +/- 32 microU/ml and from 29 +/- 5 to 65 +/- 13 and 51 +/- 7 microU/ml, respectively. Glucose was unchanged in all experiments. In fetal and neonatal sheep, AVP has minimal effects on IRG and IRI release. In contrast, OT increases both substantially; furthermore, there is a difference in fetal and neonatal responsiveness. OT may be important in modulating glucagon and insulin secretion during and after parturition.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently provided evidence that elevated levels of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated rat adipocytes. To investigate the mechanism of Ca2+ action, we examined the effects of elevated levels of [Ca2+]i on insulin binding, autophosphorylation, and tyrosine kinase activity (TKA) of insulin receptors as well as basal and insulin-stimulated cellular distribution of glucose transporters. The latter was assessed by cytochalasin-B binding to plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions. Elevated concentrations of [Ca2+]i were maintained by incubating adipocytes with a depolarizing concentration of K+ (40 mM). Basal nonstimulated glucose uptake was not altered by increased levels of [Ca2+]i. Adipocytes with higher [Ca2+]i (220 +/- 15 nM) showed 30% reduction in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with control cells ([Ca2+]i, 140 +/- 18 nM). Moreover, adipocytes with higher levels of [Ca2+]i demonstrated an approximately 10% reduction in autophosphorylation and TKA of insulin receptors without a change in insulin binding. Both basal and insulin-stimulated distributions of glucose transporters were unaffected by sustained levels of [Ca2+]i. The effects of elevated [Ca2+]i were not mimicked by protein kinase-C activation. These observations suggest that 1) elevated or sustained levels of [Ca2+]i impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; and 2) Ca2+-induced impairment appears to reside at the postbinding steps of insulin action and probably interferes with the TKA of insulin receptors and the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters.\r"

Immunohistochemical techniques using antisera selective for each subunit were used to localize the polypeptide chains. In situ hybridization using radiolabeled complementary RNA probes enabled localization of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding these subunits. In 12-day-old rats, immunostaining and mRNA signal for the alpha-subunit was found in Leydig cell clusters. The beta A- and beta B-subunit staining and beta A-subunit message were detectable in isolated interstitial cells, but the clusters appeared to lack these subunits. Positive immunostaining for each subunit was localized in a Sertoli cell-like pattern in seminiferous tubules, as was a positive mRNA signal for the alpha- and beta B-subunit over regions containing these cell types. Treatment with human CG (hCG) and PMSG greatly enhanced the production of the alpha-subunit in the Leydig cell clusters, but not within the tubules, of these young rats. In adult rats, alpha- and beta B-subunit staining, and alpha-subunit mRNA signal, was observed in the interstitial cells. As in the immature animals, all three subunits were localized in a Sertoli cell-like pattern in the tubules, and a positive mRNA signal for the alpha- and beta B-subunits was found over these cells. There was, however, no obvious change in the expression of the subunits in the testis of adult rats after gonadotropin treatment. The present findings suggest that: 1) in the rat testis, both Sertoli and interstitial cells produce inhibin/activin subunits; 2) the alpha- and beta-subunits are produced by different types of interstitial cells in immature rats; and 3) the production of the alpha-subunit in the Leydig cells of immature rats is regulated by LH-like hormones.\r"

In neonatal rat islets, exposure to rPRL for more than 24 h was necessary for a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. By day 4, insulin secretion was 3.8-fold greater in the islets cultured with rPRL. rGH had a modest effect on insulin secretion, and this effect was additive with that of rPRL. Both rPRL and rGH increased islet insulin content and [3H]thymidine incorporation. After removal of rPRL, more than 24 h were necessary to detect a reversal in the level of insulin secretion. In addition, even after 5 days without rPRL the previously treated islets still had elevated levels of insulin secretion. In a dose-response study of rPRL on insulin secretion, a detectable effect was observed at 62.5 ng/ml, with a half-maximal effect of approximately 100 ng/ml. Glucose oxidation by neonatal islets was enhanced by rPRL treatment, but not by rGH treatment. In adult rat islets, exposure to rPRL, but not to rGH, enhanced insulin secretion. In contrast, when using heterologous human GH, results similar to those obtained with rPRL, but not rGH, were observed. The results from these experiments indicate that rPRL and rGH have both individual and shared regulatory effects on rat islets. However, it is rPRL and not rGH that has the primary influence on insulin secretion. When interpreting studies examining the effect of GH and PRL on islet function, it is important to consider whether homologous hormones are used.\r"

In the presence of 7 mM glucose, but not 2.75 mM glucose, 1 mM carbachol evoked a sustained insulin secretory response. At both glucose levels, carbachol stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, an event monitored in myo-[2-3H]inositol-prelabeled islets by increases in [3H]inositol efflux and labeled inositol phosphate accumulation. Prior exposure to carbachol (0.1-1 mM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the subsequent insulin secretory response to 7.5 mM glucose. This sensitization developed within 2 min and lasted for at least 45 min after carbachol removal from the perifusion medium. Carbachol pretreatment also sensitized the islet to either 200 microM tolbutamide or 10 mM arginine. Prior exposure to 1 mM acetylcholine induced a similar proemial sensitization to a subsequent challenge with glucose. These results demonstrate that even though cholinergic stimulation increases phosphoinositide hydrolysis, this event is insufficient to initiate sustained insulin secretion from islets exposed to a low (2.75 mM) glucose concentration. However, this increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis sensitizes islets to a subsequent challenge with one of several different stimuli, including glucose. Hence, this sensitization of islets to physiologically relevant glucose concentrations may represent the major contribution of vagal stimulation to the regulation of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we have characterized hepatic insulin receptor function in two animal models of obesity: the Zucker fatty rat (ZFR), a model of genetic obesity with severe hyperinsulinemia, and the Sprague-Dawley rat with dietary obesity, a model of acquired obesity. Zucker fatty rats were also treated with streptozotocin (STZ) in an effort to examine the effects of relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in the setting of obesity. Using wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptor extracted from liver, no significant difference in insulin binding was identified in either model of obesity. beta-Subunit autophosphorylation was significantly decreased in both obese models relative to that in controls (72% in the obese ZFR and 49% in the overfed Sprague-Dawley model). Kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation of the 1142-1153 synthetic peptide, was also decreased in both models of obesity by 22% and 64%, respectively. In the Zucker rat, STZ treatment led to an 80% increase in receptor concentration and a further 70% increase in beta-subunit autophosphorylation per receptor, whereas tyrosine kinase activity toward substrate was not altered. Since kinase activity is closely linked to autophosphorylation, we determined the fraction of autophosphorylated (activated) receptors vs. non-phosphorylated (inactive) receptors by using antiphosphotyrosine antibody to precipitate receptors bound with [125I]insulin. There was no significant difference in the percentage of activated insulin receptors in the dietary obese, ZFR, or STZ-treated Zucker rat vs. that in the controls. In all models, the percentage of activated receptors ranged from 32-46% of the total receptor pool. These data suggest that in genetic and acquired obesity, autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit is reduced and is a limiting factor in insulin receptor activation. A similar fraction of all receptors appears to undergo some level of autophosphorylation; however, full autophosphorylation and, thus, activation of the receptor do not occur, and this results in a decrease in kinase activity. This block in autophosphorylation may account for significant reductions in insulin receptor kinase function in obesity.\r"

The present study examined whether V can also improve glucose homeostasis in genetically obese, insulin-resistant rats. Na3VO4 was administered for 3 months in water and food to Zucker fa/fa rats. Since these V rats reduced their food intake by about 30% compared to controls (C), one group of untreated rats was pair-fed (P-F) with V rats. In the fed state, the insulin/glucose ratio was lower in V rats than in P-F or C rats, merely because of a decrease (approximately 50%) in plasma insulin levels. Tolerance to oral glucose was improved in V rats only; the integrated glucose response was 30% lower than that in P-F or C rats. Insulin levels were also lower in V rats, but the integrated response was not consistently decreased. During an iv glucose tolerance test, the glucose disappearance rate was 50% higher in V rats than in the other two groups. An iv arginine test clearly showed that B-cell responsiveness was not increased in V rats. Insulin sensitivity, assessed by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, was similar in V and P-F rats and slightly better than that in C rats. In conclusion, oral vanadate produces a sustained improvement of glucose homeostasis by an insulin-like, largely body weight-independent mechanism in genetically insulin-resistant rats.\r"

Glucocorticoid infusion lowered mean basal levels of ir-CRF (P less than 0.05), ir-ACTH (P less than 0.05), and cortisol (P less than 0.05), but not of ir-AVP. Audiovisual stress led to coordinate release of ir-AVP and ir-CRF, and although the hypothalamic response to this stress was not altered in dexamethasone (DEX)-infused sheep, the pituitary-adrenal response was blocked, suggesting that glucocorticoids act on the pituitary rather than on higher centers to inhibit this response. In contrast, hypoglycemia led to preferential release of ir-AVP over ir-CRF, and DEX infusion delayed and inhibited both hypothalamic and pituitary responses. Ketamine injection also led to preferential release of ir-AVP, but neither the hypothalamic nor pituitary-adrenal responses were affected by DEX infusion. These results suggest that different stressors evoke different patterns of hypothalamic secretagogue release, and that glucocorticoids act in a site-specific fashion to regulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress.\r"

It depended on the presence of Na+ in the bathing solution and was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Despite this behavior suggesting that it might be via a Na+ channel, its reversal potential exceeded 80 mV compared to 46 mV for the Na+ equilibrium potential. It was increased by increased Ca2+ concentration in the bathing solution and eliminated by Co2+ and by diltiazem. The other Ca2+ current resembled the slow inward Ca2+ current ICa(si), described in other cell types. Insulin decreased both Ca2+ currents; even at 64 pM insulin reduced ICa(si). When outward K+ currents were prevented, the myoball action potential was altered greatly, owing to the unopposed effect of ICa(si). Its duration was on the order of seconds. Insulin, in a concentration-dependent manner, beginning at 60 pM, reduced the duration of this action potential more effectively than nimodipine. This is the most sensitive response to insulin observed in skeletal muscle.\r"

Adipocytes preincubated in defined medium exhibit a low level of hexose transport which is acutely (15 min) stimulated (greater than 5-fold) by insulin (EC50, 0.1-0.2 nM). GH has acute (15-45 min) insulin-mimetic (greater than 2-fold) and chronic (4-48 h) diabetogenic (50-80%) effects on basal and insulin-stimulated hexose transport. The insulin-mimetic effect of GH has a higher EC50 (2 nM) than its diabetogenic effect (EC50, 0.2 nM). Chronic GH exposure decreases the maximal responsiveness (50-80%) and the acute sensitivity (approximately 2-fold) of hexose transport to insulin. Insulin-stimulated transport is more (approximately 5-fold) sensitive to the diabetogenic effect of GH than is basal transport. Insulin binding and degradation were not altered by chronic exposure to GH. The diabetogenic effect of GH may occur at a postinsulin binding level.\r"

  ".W": "Oxytocin is a major peptide product of the ruminant corpus luteum, and the release of oxytocin from serum-free cultures of bovine granulosa cells is stimulated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Here we have assessed the effects of insulin and IGF-I on oxytocin gene expression in bovine granulosa cells and the dependence of these effects on the developmental status of the cells. When cells from individual follicles were cultured, the estradiol concentration of the follicular fluid was highly correlated with insulin-stimulated oxytocin release. Subsequently, cells were pooled from follicles selected on the basis of estradiol content, and two subsets of cells were distinguished. The first contained highly differentiated cells, as judged by the high estradiol (HE-cells) concentration of the follicular fluid (greater than 40 ng/ml), high levels of LH receptors, and high hCG-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The second subset contained cells from follicles with low estradiol (less than 1 ng/ml; LE-cells) which have fewer LH receptors and low hCG-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Oxytocin production was increased more than 50-fold by insulin (EC50, 230 +/- 57 ng/ml) and IGF-I (EC50, greater than 10 ng/ml), but only in the HE-cells. Oxytocin mRNA was also greatly increased by insulin and IGF-I in the HE-cells only. In contrast, insulin and IGF-I stimulated progesterone release from both HE- and LE-cells. Since oxytocin production is a characteristic of bovine luteal cells, our results support possible roles for IGF-I and insulin in regulation of luteinization or luteal activity. The data suggest that effects of insulin and IGF-I on oxytocin production reflect their effects on oxytocin gene transcription, and that granulosa cells must be appropriately primed (presumably by the in vivo hormonal environment) before they are able to produce oxytocin in response to these polypeptides.\r"

Forskolin (1 microM), used to stimulate adenylate cyclase, moderately delayed the neoformation of islets, slightly accelerated the proliferation of endocrine cells, and considerably increased insulin release by the cultures. The latter increase was not completely compensated for by the stimulation of insulin biosynthesis, so that the islet insulin content was decreased. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 25 nM), used to stimulate protein kinase-C, had little effect on the evolution of the cultures, but increased insulin release. This increase was almost compensated for by the stimulation of insulin biosynthesis. After 9-10 days of culture, insulin release in response to 15 mM glucose or 10 mM leucine was studied with perifused islets. In control islets, glucose produced a sustained increase in insulin release, which, however, was 6-fold smaller than that produced by leucine. Addition of forskolin or TPA to the perifusion medium markedly amplified the response to glucose without causing a biphasic pattern of release. In islets cultured with forskolin, the insulin response to glucose or leucine was decreased, largely owing to the lower insulin stores. In islets cultured with TPA, the insulin response to glucose or leucine was also decreased, but these differences cannot be explained simply by changes in insulin content. Neither treatment affected the kinetics of release. In conclusion, acute stimulation of adenylate cyclase or protein kinase-C markedly increased insulin release from fetal islets without causing an adult-like biphasic pattern of secretion. Chronic stimulation did not accelerate maturation of B-cells.\r"

  ".U": "90005228\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of neurohypophyseal nonapeptides in the adrenal gland of nonmammalian vertebrates and the possible action of these regulatory peptides on corticosteroid secretion have never been investigated. We have applied the indirect immunofluorescence technique to examine whether vasotocin (AVT) and/or mesotocin (MT) are located in frog adrenal (interrenal) tissue. Using antisera against AVT and tyrosine hydroxylase, we found that all chromaffin cells contain an AVT-like peptide. Labeling of consecutive sections with phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase or AVT antibodies showed that both noradrenaline- and adrenaline-storing cells contain AVT-like immunoreactivity. In contrast no labeling of frog adrenal slices was observed using a MT antiserum. At the ultrastructural level, the immunogold technique revealed that the AVT-immunoreactive peptide is sequestered in chromaffin granules with varying electron densities. Filtration of frog adrenal tissue extracts on Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges showed that the elution profile of the AVT-like peptide was similar to that of synthetic AVT. The apparent concentration of AVT in the adrenal was 2.7 ng/g tissue. Since chromaffin cells represent approximately one third of all interrenal cells, the actual concentration of AVT in chromaffin tissue was about 8 ng/g tissue. The role of AVT in the regulation of frog adrenal steroidogenesis was studied in vitro using perifused frog interrenal slices. Graded doses of AVT (10(-10)-10(-7) M) induced a dose-dependent stimulation of both corticosterone and aldosterone secretion. The other neurohypophyseal peptides (vasopressin, oxytocin, and MT) were also able to enhance corticosteroid secretion, but AVT was by far the most potent stimulator of steroidogenesis. Prolonged administration (4 h) of AVT induced a rapid increase in corticosterone and aldosterone output, followed by a gradual decline of corticosteroid secretion. These results show that an AVT-like peptide is stored in chromaffin granules of frog adrenal gland. Our data also indicate that synthetic AVT is a potent stimulator of corticosteroid secretion by frog interrenal cells. Since in amphibians adrenocortical and chromaffin cells are intimately intermingled, these results suggest that AVT produced by chromaffin cells may regulate corticosteroid release locally, through a cell to cell mode of communication.\r"

  ".W": "The action of sex steroids on the growth and differentiation of target tissues requires the presence of specific intracellular receptors. We compared the distribution of cells containing estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) in rabbit uterus by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against these receptors. Initial experiments using serial cryostat sections surprisingly revealed the intensity of staining for ER to be inversely proportional to that of PR, as follows: ER, luminal and glandular epithelium greater than myometrium greater than stroma; PR, stroma greater than myometrium greater than glands greater than luminal epithelium. Localization was strictly confined to the nuclei of target cells. Single and dual immunofluorescent labeling of ER and PR in cryostat sections was accomplished using fluorochromes with differing emission spectra. Individual fields of dual labeled sections were examined for red [phycoerythrin (ER)] and green [fluorescein (PR)] fluorescence, with the same distribution as noted by single antibody immunohistochemistry. Myometrial nuclei displayed fluorescence of equivalent relative intensity for both antibodies. Further, sequential exposure photomicrography (exposure first in the spectrum of phycoerythrin emission, followed by exposure in the spectrum of fluorescein emission) revealed the presence of occasional stromal cells staining only for PR and some luminal cells staining only for ER. This differential distribution of ER and PR within various cell populations of rabbit is a novel observation and challenges current concepts of receptor regulation. Dual immunofluorescent localization of both ER and PR within individual cells provides a unique perspective from which to investigate the interactive influences of these sex steroid receptors at the cellular level.\r"

Rat fallopian tubes were excised with the uterus, immediately fixed by freeze-substitution, and processed for immunoperoxidase staining. Staining employed a rabbit antiserum against purified rat intestinal calbindin-D9k and the streptavidin-biotin technique. Calbindin-D9k immunoreactivity was localized to luminal epithelial cells of the fallopian tube of mature rats, with no staining observed in other tissue layers of the tube. Epithelial cells in both the isthmus and the ampulla were positive for calbindin-D9k. In weanling rats, which have little ovarian function but high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, no immunoreactive calbindin-D9k was observed in any part of the tube. However, after daily injections of estradiol (6 micrograms/day) for 3 days, intense staining was observed in the epithelial cells of the immature rat fallopian tube. Progesterone treatment (1 mg/day for 3 days) of immature rats had no effect on calbindin-D9k in fallopian tube. The lumen of the fallopian tube (oviduct) is the key location for fertilization, a process that requires a narrowly defined concentration of extracellular calcium. By analogy to the intestine, calbindin-D9k may play a role in the transcellular movement of calcium across the fallopian tube epithelium in the fallopian tube lumen.\r"

  ".W": "An investigation was carried out to define the ontogeny of normal mouse mammary gland responsiveness to the proliferative effects of estrogen (E) and/or progesterone (P). Since hormone receptors for both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) are present in both epithelial and stromal cells, we have investigated how the effects of E and P are related to the presence of receptor activity in the epithelium and stroma. Intact or ovariectomized mice, between 3 days and 10 weeks of age, were used to study the effects of E and/or P on DNA synthesis, as determined by DNA histoautoradiography; the cellular distribution of ER and PgR was investigated by steroid autoradiography. The results indicate that the mammary gland sequentially acquires the ability to respond to the stimulatory effects of E and/or P. In the early postnatal period (3-14 days) neither hormone was effective. Both epithelial and stromal cells first became responsive to E at 3-4 weeks of age. Estrogen receptors were first detected in stromal cells at 5 days of age and in epithelial cells at 2 weeks of age. Thus, the acquisition of estrogen responsiveness did not appear to be tightly coupled to the presence of ER in either epithelial or stromal cells. In contrast, responsiveness to P was acquired significantly later, at 7 weeks of age, and was closely linked to the presence of E-inducible PgR in epithelial cells. P caused a highly synergistic effect on epithelial cell DNA synthesis when combined with E, providing further support for the concept that the major proliferative effect of P is mediated via E-inducible PgR. PgR were also present in stromal cells, but the proliferative effect of P in that cell type was not correlated with the presence of PgR.\r"

The pathogenetic mechanism responsible for retinopathy is imperfectly understood, but much of the mechanism is apparently reproduced by experimental diabetes in animals and by chronic elevation of blood galactose in nondiabetic animals. The evidence that retinopathy is a consequence of excessive blood sugars and their sequelae is consistent with a demonstrated inhibition of retinopathy by strict glycemic control in diabetic dogs. However, retinopathy in the dog model has shown a tendency to resist intervention by strict control. Biochemical and pathophysiological sequelae of hyperglycemia possibly critical to the development of retinopathy in humans and animal models are being studied in many laboratories. Retinopathy occurs in experimental galactosemia in the absence of the renal hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, and glomerular obliteration typical of diabetes in humans and dogs, implying that retinopathy and nephropathy differ appreciably in pathogenesis.\r"

Functional and morphological studies were performed in cultured newborn rat islets of Langerhans exposed from 6 h to 6 days to 50-2000 ng/L recombinant human IL-1 beta. Beta-Cell activity was modulated by glucose and nonglucose agents (15 mM L-leucine and 10 microM of long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995). In 11 mM glucose, 2000 ng/L of IL-1 beta caused inhibition of insulin release after approximately 6 h of exposure to IL-1 beta; in 3.3 mM glucose culture, onset of inhibition was delayed by this IL-1 beta concentration until after 48 h of exposure. Similarly, stimulation and suppression of beta-cell function with L-leucine and SMS 201-995, respectively, resulted in acceleration and delay of IL-1 beta-mediated inhibition. The dose-response curve of the IL-1 beta effect was shifted left- and rightward during high and low beta-cell activity, respectively. In analogy, increasing IL-1 beta concentration, exposure time, and beta-cell activity resulted in increasing islet disintegration. Thus, the resting beta-cell is more resistant to IL-1 beta-mediated impairment than the working beta-cell.\r"

Competition studies with 125I-labeled IGF-I and unlabeled IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin showed the specificity of 125I-IGF-I binding to the IGF-I receptors in adipocytes, membranes, and partially purified detergent-solubilized extracts. The monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor (alpha-IR3) inhibits 125I-IGF-I binding and immunoprecipitates the IGF-I receptor. In addition, the alpha-subunit of IGF-I receptor is approximately 10,000 Mr larger than the alpha-subunit of insulin receptor, and IGF-I stimulates phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the IGF-I receptor. IGF-I stimulates basal glucose transport in human adipocytes, but the concentrations of IGF-I required for half-maximal and maximal stimulation of glucose transport are 800- and 1000-fold greater than that of insulin. The possibility of IGF-I stimulating glucose transport by interacting predominantly with insulin receptors is suggested by data showing that 1) IGF-I competes with insulin-binding sites, 2) there is a lack of an additive effect with IGF-I and insulin in stimulating glucose transport, 3) alpha-IR3, which specifically inhibits IGF-I binding, does not inhibit IGF-I or insulin-stimulated glucose transport, 4) insulin-receptor antibody MA-10 inhibits IGF-I and insulin-stimulated glucose transport, and 5) IGF-I stimulates insulin-receptor autophosphorylation, although its effect is markedly decreased compared with insulin. In summary, human adipocytes possess specific IGF-I receptors. However, IGF-I stimulates glucose transport predominantly by interacting with the insulin receptor.\r"

Subjects were studied after 5 days of prednisone (60 mg/day) or no steroid treatment and were infused with somatostatin, glucagon, growth hormone, [3H]glucose, [14C]leucine, and insulin (0.1 or 0.2 mU.kg-1.min-1). At each rate of insulin infusion, the rate of leucine oxidation was increased (P less than .001) after steroid treatment. Leucine flux, an indicator of whole-body proteolysis, was similar in the presence or absence of steroid treatment (2.26 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.04 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively) at the lower rate of insulin infusion but was higher during steroid treatment (2.18 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.84 +/- 0.13 mumol.kg-1.min-1) at the 0.2-mU.kg-1.min-1 insulin infusion. Steroid pretreatment had no significant effect on the nonoxidative rates of leucine disappearance. These data provide strong evidence that the protein wasting associated with glucocorticosteroid therapy is in part the result of steroid-induced resistance to the antiproteolytic effect of insulin and an increase in the oxidation (and thus wasting) of one essential amino acid, leucine.\r"

The serum from a healthy islet cell antibody (ICA)+ and IAA+ subject was used to construct standard curves with and without preincubation with 1 U/ml human insulin. Reporting results in arbitrary displacement (delta +/- IAA) units derived from the standard curve improved precision and increased the specificity of the assay. Frequency analysis of the results from 200 control adults did not show a normal distribution, and cumulative frequency analysis demonstrated two populations: 10 of 200 (5%) control adults, 8 of 241 (3.3%) healthy schoolchildren, and 18 of 229 (7.9%) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients had IAAs greater than 12 delta +/- IAA units.

Of those with ICAs greater than 5 JDF units, 12 developed IDDM and 1 developed NIDDM in 10 yr of study.

Because alpha-cell function and blood flow control are known to be disturbed in diabetes, we investigated whether adenosine was still effective in streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats. Our experiments were performed on isolated perfused rat pancreases. Whereas, in normal rats, adenosine (1.65 microM) induced a 200% increase in glucagon output and a 25% rise in the pancreatic vascular flow rate, in rats diabetic for 5-6 wk, this nucleoside was ineffective on glucagon secretion, and its vasodilatory effect was strongly reduced. Long-term in vivo insulin treatment that reversed high glycemia levels was able to restore in large part both adenosine effects. In contrast, a short-term in vitro pretreatment with insulin was unable to restore the nucleoside effects. We conclude that STZ-D suppresses the stimulatory effect of adenosine on alpha-cells and strongly reduces its vasodilator properties; these abnormalities may be corrected in large part by long-term insulin treatment with normalization of glycemia.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy by clinical and electrophysiological criteria and the prevalence of autonomic parasympathetic nerve dysfunction by heart-rate variation during deep breathing (expiration-to-inspiration ratio [E:1]) in 132 newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects aged 45-64 yr and 142 randomly selected nondiabetic control subjects. The relationship of nerve dysfunction to the degree of hyperglycemia and insulin-secretion capacity were also investigated. Single and scattered symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy were found in both diabetic and control subjects. Symptomatic polyneuropathy was found in 1.5% of diabetic subjects but none of the control subjects. Polyneuropathy defined by clinical signs was found in 2.3% of the diabetic subjects and 1.4% of the control subjects. No subjects with both symptoms and signs were seen. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were significantly slower in diabetic than control subjects. Polyneuropathy according to electrophysiological criteria was found in 15.2% of diabetic subjects but was not found in any control subjects. Electromyographic abnormalities were more common in diabetic than control women, but not significant differences were found in men. The resting heart rate was higher in diabetic than control women, but no significant difference was found in men. The mean E:I was significantly lower in diabetic men and women than control men and women. An abnormally low E:I was found in 9.2% of the diabetic men, 3.3% of the control men, 3.3% of the diabetic women, and none of the control women. NCV parameters, but not E:I, were inversely correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. A positive correlation between NCV and fasting and postglucose serum insulin levels was found in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fish oils, containing omega-3 fatty acids (omega 3FAs), favorably influence plasma lipoproteins in nondiabetic humans and prevent the development of insulin resistance induced by fat feeding in rats. We studied the effects of fish oils in 10 subjects (aged 42-65 yr) with mild non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Subjects were fed a standard diabetic diet plus 1) no supplementation (baseline), 2) 10 g fish oil concentrate (30% omega 3FAs) daily, and 3) 10 g safflower oil daily over separate 3-wk periods, the latter two supplements being given in radom order by use of a double-blind crossover design. At the end of each diet period, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, and lipids were measured, and insulin sensitivity was assessed with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp performed with [3-3H]glucose. FBG increased 14% during fish oil and 11% during safflower oil supplementation compared with baseline (P less than .05), whereas body weight, fasting serum insulin levels, and insulin sensitivity were unchanged. The absolute increase in FBG during each supplementation period correlated with the baseline FBG (fish oil, r = .83, P less than .005); safflower oil, r = .75, P = .012). Fasting plasma triglyceride levels decreased during fish oil supplementation in the 4 subjects with baseline hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 2 mM) but were not significantly reduced overall. There was no significant change in fasting plasma total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In summary, dietary fish oil supplementation adversely affected glycemic control in NIDDM subjects without producing significant beneficial effects on plasma lipids. The effect of safflower oil supplementation was not significantly different from fish oil, suggesting that the negative effects on glucose metabolism may be related to the extra energy or fat intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cytoplasmic islet cell antibody-negative (ICA-; less than 20 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units, n = 1670) and ICA+ (n = 42) first-degree relatives of type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic individuals were studied for competitive insulin autoantibodies (CIAAs) with a radioassay. Overall, 3.7% of first-degree relatives (64 of 1712) were CIAA+. Of ICA- relatives, 2.7% (45 of 1670) exceeded the upper limit of our normal CIAA range (greater than 39 nU/ml), and 45% (19 of 42) of ICA+ relatives exceeded this normal range. Follow-up serums for repeat CIAA determination have been obtained from 16 of the nondiabetic CIAA+/ICA- individuals (time between samples, 0.4-5.8 yr). Fourteen of these 16 (87%) CIAA+/ICA- relatives were found to still be positive on follow-up, and 2 of the relatives who were positive on the first determination were negative on their follow-up test. With a mean follow-up of approximately 2 yr, 4 of 45 (9%) of the CIAA+/ICA- relatives, 5 of 23 (22%) of the ICA+/CIAA- relatives, and 12 of 19 (63%) of the CIAA+/ICA+ relatives developed diabetes. Life-table analysis indicated that, overall, 53% of CIAA+ relatives become diabetic after 5 yr of follow-up versus 65% of ICA+ relatives. Also by life-table analysis, the predicted risk after 5 yr of follow-up for progression to diabetes is 17% for CIAA+/ICA- relatives, 42% for ICA+/CIAA- relatives, and 77% for CIAA+/ICA+ relatives. The highest rate of progression to diabetes was found in ICA+ relatives with CIAA levels greater than 150 nU/ml (100% projected to be diabetic within 5 yr, P less than .008 vs. ICA+/CIAA- relatives).\r"

The protein was precipitated from patient serums incubated with Triton X-100 lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled rat pancreatic islets that had been cultured in 5, 11, or 28 mM glucose for 6 h or 3 days. In both types of experiment, 28 mM glucose was the most efficient stimulator of 64,000-Mr autoantigen production. In contrast, the class I antigens of the major histocompatibility complex, precipitated by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum, were not influenced by differences in glucose concentrations. Our data indicate that expression of islet cell antigens may be increased during the course of hyperglycemia and suggest that the functional activity of islet cells influences their antigenicity.\r"

  ".W": "Islet cell killing mediated by natural killer cells and T-lymphocytes in diabetes-prone (DP) and diabetic BB rats has been described, but other killing mechanisms may also be involved. Histopathologic studies suggest that macrophages are the first immune cells to infiltrate islets. To determine if macrophages are the first cells mediating islet damage, macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated in BB rats of different ages. Splenic macrophages isolated from DP rats at 33, 100, 120, and 140 days of age showed no enhanced islet killing compared with diabetes-resistant rats. Killing at diabetes onset (121 +/- 14 days) was markedly increased (43 +/- 9.3%) compared with age-matched diabetes-resistant controls (19 +/- 8.3%, P less than .001). Islet inflammation was monitored at all time points. At 120 and 140 days of age, 9 of 11 (82%) DP rats had insulitis, and cytotoxicity was increased in 6 of 11 (55%) rats, which is similar to the number of DP rats that progress to diabetes. At 100 days, 3 of 6 (50%) DP rats again showed diabetic levels of killing, even in the absence of insulitis. These data indicate that 1) islet inflammation is dissociated from clinical diabetes onset, 2) splenic macrophages may have islet-killing potential before islet inflammation, 3) macrophage-mediated islet killing is elevated in all animals immediately after diabetes onset, and 4) macrophages, in addition to natural killer cells and T-lymphocytes, are responsible for cell-mediated islet destruction and thus are candidates for the first cellular effector to result in islet killing.\r"
