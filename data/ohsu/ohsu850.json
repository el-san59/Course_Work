One of us (P.R.J.) evaluated all infants, twice during the initial hospital stay and 2 weeks later. Eighteen fractured clavicles were identified for a frequency of 2.9% (18/626). One fracture was discovered on the first hospital examination, 10 on discharge, and 7 at follow-up. Only 2 patients had symptoms usually associated with fractured clavicles. The most reliable clinical sign for in-hospital diagnosis was difficulty in feeling the margins of the affected clavicle when compared with the normal clavicle. The mean birth weight of the infants was 3604 g (range, 3000 to 4930 g), and no obstetric complications occurred. The reported frequency of fractures diagnosed clinically during hospitalization significantly underestimates their occurrence. Most newborn infants with fractures have no symptoms and minimal physical findings during the first days of life, making repeated examination necessary.\r"

Appropriate antimicrobial therapy may shorten the duration of diarrhea caused by shigellae and eliminate the organism from the feces. Current recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association are that infected children be isolated until three and two, respectively, consecutive stool cultures are negative. We utilized a disease control strategy based on use of antibiotics to control diarrheal symptoms and reduce infectiousness, cohorting of asymptomatic infected children in the center, and scrupulous attention to hygiene and environmental cleanliness. This strategy was effective in stopping transmission, was more practical than some of the measures now recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association, and was well accepted by parents and center staff. The strategy should be evaluated in other day-care settings.\r"

Newer developments in the field include use of arachidonic acid metabolism pathway inhibitors and radioprotectants. The use of these pharmacologicals, together with modification of the mechanics of radiation delivery, may lead us close to elimination of the complications in normal esophageal tissue, while enhancing localized response in the thoracic tumors.\r"

The only side effect found was diarrhea: 10%, 14%, and 32% in the placebo, 25-micrograms, and 50-micrograms treatment groups, respectively. Severe diarrhea occurred in 1% of those patients who received the 50-micrograms dosage regimen, but in none of the other two groups. Arbaprostil at these two dosage levels, when given for 4 wk, appears to be a safe and efficacious agent for the treatment of acute duodenal ulcers.\r"

  ".U": "90144651\r", 
  ".W": "Adult onset nesidioblastosis (AON) is an extremely rare entity associated with hypersecretion of insulin. Previous reports have demonstrated that the somatostatin analog, Sandostatin (SMS), will control the clinical symptoms induced by infantile nesidioblastosis. We hypothesized that insulin, C-peptide, and secondary peptide secretion from AON is provocable. We also hypothesized that SMS would suppress both basal and provoked primary and secondary peptide secretion in AON. To test this hypothesis, in a patient with AON, 13 gut peptide levels were determined at set intervals during provocative testing with a test meal, a calcium infusion, a secretin bolus, and a glucagon bolus. These tests were repeated under the influence of SMS. Insulin, C-peptide, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels were elevated in the basal state. SMS suppressed all three peptides (mean 68%) (p less than 0.05). Basal fasting glucose rose by 65%, and glucose ratios were raised throughout all four tests. Insulin:glucose ratios decreased during SMS therapy. Insulin and PP secretion was increased by all four provocative tests (mean 458% and 665% above baseline, respectively). C-peptide was provoked by three tests (mean 204%). Peptides with normal basal values were also provocable. GRP and glucagon were provoked by secretin stimulation (182%, 186%, respectively). Calcium infusion stimulated CIP release by 372%. SMS suppressed the peak provoked peptide levels in all positive provocation tests (p less than 0.05). Peak provoked insulin values were decreased by 59%, C-peptide by 75%, and PP by 92%. Peak provoked glucagon, CRP, neurotensin, and GIP levels were decreased by 20%, 65%, 51%, and 73%, respectively. The patient has been maintained on SMS (25 micrograms bid) for 1 yr and has shown decreased insulin levels, normal glucose levels, and, at 1 yr, leads an asymptomatic normal life. SMS is able to suppress primary and secondary peptide secretion in both the fasting and provoked state. The long-term efficacy of SMS may be predicted by its ability to suppress primary peptide release during peak provocation.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare disorder of undetermined etiology which is associated with various medical and gastrointestinal conditions. Fewer than 50 cases of PCI occurring after organ transplantation have been reported in the transplant and surgical literature. All have occurred either after bone marrow, kidney, or liver transplantation. The etiology remains obscure but proposed factors include pretransplantation chemotherapy and radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, graft-versus-host disease, opportunistic enteric infections, and a sympathetic reaction from an adjacent inflamed allograft. The patients are often mildly symptomatic, and asymptomatic pneumoperitoneum is seen not infrequently. If the patient does not have a serious underlying illness, then the prognosis is good, with spontaneous resolution occurring in most cases. We report the first case of PCI occurring after an orthoptic cardiac transplantation, and extensively review the literature of PCI occurring in the setting of organ transplantation. We conclude that PCI is often a benign and self-limited condition in this setting, and morbidity is usually related to another complication of transplantation. Even the presence of pneumoperitoneum usually is not associated with peritonitis, and most cases of PCI can be managed conservatively.\r"

Paget's disease resided just distal to the anorectal adenocarcinoma. The area of Paget's disease was rather small. The epidermis containing Paget's cells was continuous with the anorectal adenocarcinoma, as if adenocarcinoma cells invaded directly into the epidermis. The Paget's cells were positive for neutral and acid mucus. Ultrastructurally, Paget's cells contained secretory granules, microvilli, and a few tight junctions, but lacked tonofilaments. The mucinous adenocarcinoma cells also showed histochemical and ultrastructural features that were similar to those of Paget's cells. These findings strongly suggest that the Paget's cells were derived from direct spread from the anorectal adenocarcinoma, in this case. Clinicians and pathologists should carefully examine the perianal epidermis in anorectal carcinoma, even if there are no clinical findings of perianal Paget's disease.

There was a stricture throughout the bilateral hepatic ducts and common hepatic and bile ducts with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts on imagings. The walls of the gallbladder and common bile duct were thickened due to diffuse granulomatous lesions of unknown etiology, composed mainly of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts identical with inflammatory pseudotumor. The same histological findings also were observed in the lung and lymph nodes. Jaundice disappeared, with reduced thickening of the common bile duct wall. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities subsided after high-dose prednisolone therapy, starting when dyspnea developed. There is no similar case in the literature.\r"

Patients were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) cephalothin (250 mg/L) and tobramycin (8 mg/L) in group 1, oral ofloxacin (400 mg loading followed by 300 mg daily) in group 2, and a combination of ofloxacin (400 mg followed by 300 mg daily) and rifampicin (300 mg daily). Treatment duration was 10 days. The average culture-positive rate was 75%. The overall cure rate was 80.6% with IP antibiotics, 78.4% with oral ofloxacin, and 81.1% with ofloxacin and rifampicin. After the exclusion of tunnel infections and episodes of peritonitis due to Pseudomonas and resistant organisms, the corresponding figures were 100%, 90.6%, and 93.7%, respectively. Side effects were minimal with IP treatment and with oral ofloxacin, but severe nausea and vomiting occurred in some cases with the combination of ofloxacin and rifampicin. It was concluded that oral ofloxacin is an acceptable first-line therapy for peritonitis in CAPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was developed into a life-maintaining therapy using a membrane whose fundamental biological characteristics were largely unknown. Recognition of this deficiency in our knowledge spurred a belated explosion of research that began with an exploration of the fine structure of the mesothelium. The monolayer of lining cells was found to be more sophisticated than previously imagined, being profusely carpeted with microvilli and bearing motile cilia, and in contrast to endothelium, was shown to possess a cytoplasm replete with organelles in which rough endoplasmic reticulum and lipid inclusions are prominent. Because these findings indicated possible secretory function, a link was sought between these observations and the discovery in effluent dialysate of phosphatidylcholine, a lubricant surfactant. Subsequently, comparison of mesothelial ultrastructure with that of type 2 pneumocytes revealed close concordance, while specialized fixation techniques developed for the preservation of lamellar bodies (the known storage vesicles of alveolar surfactant), when applied to mesothelium, for the first time revealed similar cytoplasmic inclusions. In vitro studies have shown that mesothelium, when incubated with radiolabeled precursor, is capable of synthesizing phosphatidylcholine, the principal constituent of pulmonary surfactant, in amounts similar to those produced by lung. The demonstration that the intensively studied type 2 pneumocyte and mesothelium both secrete lamellar bodies has opened up new possibilities in exploring the physiology, pharmacology, and pathology of the peritoneum. Recent work on mesothelial cell culture has shed new light on the factors involved in healing and regeneration. Recognition of the existence of subserosal multipotential cells and their importance in maintaining the integrity of the mesothelial cell layer is dawning. From the study of peritoneal biopsies in CAPD patients, evidence is accumulating that a process of nonenzymatic glycosylation of protein, similar to that which occurs in diabetes, is responsible for changes in stromal texture and the reduplication of basement membranes. Appreciation of stromal vulnerability to dialysate-induced accelerated aging following mesothelial loss may therefore require a new approach to peritoneal dialysis during peritonitis. Now that CAPD approaches clinical maturity there is increasing recognition of the need for strategies to ensure long-term preservation of the peritoneum as a dialyzing organ. Concomitantly there is a realization that these goals can only be attained through a much deeper appreciation of the molecular biology and pathology of the peritoneum itself.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently have liver dysfunction, which may be due to a number of causes. Determination of the patients who are likely to benefit from liver biopsy, an invasive procedure, is therefore important. In this study, the results of liver biopsy in patients with AIDS were compared to those in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients without AIDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with antibodies to HIV present in the serum underwent liver biopsy from 1984 through 1988 at the Bronx Municipal Hospital. Twenty (56%) of the patients had AIDS diagnosed prior to the liver biopsy. Indications for the liver biopsy were unexplained fever in 83%, and abnormal serum levels of biochemical parameters of liver function in 89%. RESULTS: Liver biopsy was diagnostic in 18 cases (50%), including findings of hepatic infection by mycobacteria in 15, cytomegalovirus in two, and schistosoma in one; these infections had been previously detected at an extrahepatic site in only two cases. Helpful clinical information in 10 others included findings of granulomas of undetermined etiology in four, cirrhosis in five, and chronic persistent hepatitis in one. Patients with a diagnostic biopsy, as compared to patients with a nondiagnostic biopsy, had a statistically significant increase in the frequency of having AIDS diagnosed before the biopsy, longer duration of AIDS (in patients with AIDS diagnosed before the biopsy), greater number of different prior opportunistic infections, and a more elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level. For example, 70% of patients with AIDS, as compared to 25% of patients with serum antibodies to HIV but without AIDS, had diagnostic liver biopsies. Patients with a diagnostic biopsy also had statistically significantly more frequent pulmonary symptoms, possibly due to more frequent occurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. In particular, the 15 patients with hepatic mycobacterial infection, as compared to the other patients, had a statistically significant increase in the frequency of having AIDS diagnosed prior to the biopsy, longer duration of AIDS, more frequent prior opportunistic infections, more severe leukopenia, and a more elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level. Liver biopsy was more sensitive than bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at detecting mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSION: Liver biopsy, when indicated, is useful to detect opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients who are not known to have AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Should persons with symptomatic gallstones (i.e., those that have caused biliary pain) be treated immediately? Or may they be managed expectantly until pain recurs or a biliary complication (i.e., acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis) occurs? To assess the mortality risk of different strategies, we performed a quantitative analysis. For the expectant management strategy that requires surgery only if a biliary complication occurs, the cumulative lifetime probability of gallstone disease death in a 30-year-old man is about 2%, and most deaths occur after age 65. In comparison, elective cholecystectomy has only a 0.1% rate of gallstone disease death, but all deaths occur at age 30. The average amount of life expectancy gained by immediate cholecystectomy compared with expectant management is 52 days, which is reduced to 23 days using 5% discounting. This gain could be increased only slightly by a 100% effective and risk-free therapy such as perfected lithotripsy or medical dissolution. Results are similar for women. The results suggest that, for persons with symptomatic gallstones, the life expectancy gain of immediate cholecystectomy is relatively small and that the potential incremental gain of nonsurgical therapy is also small. For patients and physicians who believe that life expectancy is of primary consideration, the decision about therapy may be made primarily on non-mortality considerations. Some patients and physicians may decide that the risk of symptomatic gallstones is low enough that a policy of expectant management may be acceptable.\r"

It appeared that the conflicting opinions with respect to the rate of correction of severe hyponatremia could be reduced to not differentiating between acute and chronic hyponatremia, to using different criteria for this distinction, and to differences in treatment strategy. After reviewing the available data in the literature, it is suggested that hyponatremia should be classified as acute whenever the rate of decrease of serum sodium exceeds 0.5 mmol/L/hour. If it is unknown at which rate the hyponatremia has developed, it can be assumed to be acute if within a short period of time (two to three days), large quantities of fluid are ingested orally or administered parenterally, especially hypotonic fluids in the presence of impaired water excretion. In other cases, chronic hyponatremia is probable. It is concluded that acute hyponatremia should be treated without delay and rapidly at a rate of at least 1 mmol/L/hour, to prevent severe neurologic damage or death. With respect to chronic hyponatremia, it appeared that severe neurologic complications almost exclusively occurred in patients who were treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline without the addition of furosemide or an osmotic diuretic agent, resulting in a (rapid) correction rate of 0.5 mmol/L/hour or more. In contrast, patients with severe chronic hyponatremia treated with furosemide and isotonic or hypertonic saline almost uniformly did well after rapid correction. Uneventful recovery is also the rule when severe chronic hyponatremia is corrected slowly, at a rate less than 0.5 mmol/L/hour. On pathophysiologic grounds, and bearing in mind that slow correction was used in the majority of reported patients in the literature with severe chronic hyponatremia who recovered without neurologic complications, this treatment modality is preferable. Whenever the available data do not permit a differentiation between acute or chronic hyponatremia, rapid correction has to be pursued by means of administration of hypertonic or isotonic saline together with furosemide.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is a new technique capable of assessing regional myocardial perfusion in vivo in real time. At present, this technique involves the intraaortic or intracoronary injection of microbubbles of air. As these microbubbles traverse the myocardium, they produce opacification of the myocardium in concomitantly performed echocardiographic images. In animal models, MCE has been demonstrated to assess accurately the in vivo risk area (region of the myocardium at risk for necrosis after acute coronary occlusion). It has also been shown to provide quantitative information on regional myocardial blood flow (both antegrade and collateral). This technique has been demonstrated to be safe in humans. In clinical studies it has been shown to be a useful adjunct to cardiac catheterization, particularly in the assessment of coronary blood flow reserve and collateral blood flow. MCE is also used in the operating room to assess regional myocardial perfusion before and after bypass graft operations. The microbubbles used for MCE were shown to opacify the left ventricular cavity after their injection into a peripheral vein. If myocardial opacification after venous injection can be achieved, MCE will have the potential for the simultaneous noninvasive in vivo assessment of regional myocardial perfusion and function in humans.\r"

This broad review will discuss the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of urinary incontinence. The initial evaluation and treatment options will also be outlined. As the aged population continues to grow, physicians can expect to see this problem with greater frequency. It is hoped that this discussion will facilitate the evaluation and management of this common but frequently neglected problem.\r"

At 20 and 24 weeks an abnormal resistance index was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation but not with preeclampsia, with or without proteinuria. A low fetal abdominal circumference at 20 or 24 weeks or an increasing maternal plasma uric acid concentration at 24 weeks was as predictive as an elevated resistance index. In a second group of 43 women, screened in the same way, the only association was of an elevated resistance index at 20 weeks with intrauterine growth retardation. Although elevated resistance indices occur more commonly in women who develop intrauterine growth retardation and/or preeclampsia, the correlation is not close enough to be clinically useful as a screening test.\r"

Blood gases and pH, measured in umbilical venous samples obtained by cordocentesis within 1 hour of the Doppler studies, were correlated individually and as an \"asphyxia\" index, to the Doppler and ultrasonographic biometric measurements. Although there were significant correlations between the majority of the ultrasonographic biometric and Doppler measurements with the blood gas results, better correlations were found with the ratio of common carotid artery to descending thoracic aorta mean velocity and pulsatility index. The best predictor of asphyxia was an index comprising aortic mean velocity and the common carotid artery pulsatility index. When this index was abnormal, 89% of fetuses had an asphyxia index 1 SD above the mean and 60% 2 SDs above the mean. A normal index was always associated with normal blood gases. The indices representing the inverse relationship of impedance and velocity in the two major vessels that supply the brain and the abdominal viscera provide the best prediction of the fetal condition because they reflect the hemodynamic response to changes in the partial pressure of respiratory gases.\r"

Fifty percent of women with preeclampsia versus 15.4% of control women had either immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M binding. In addition, immunofluorescent staining of normal renal cortical tissue with preeclamptic sera showed increased binding of immunoglobulin G to arterioles in patients with anti-vascular endothelial cell antibodies. These antibodies were not directed at HLA antigens and did not cross react with platelets. Interferon-gamma stimulation did not increase immunoglobulin binding. Antibodies to antigens expressed on vascular endothelial cells may be important in mediating the endothelial damage seen in preeclampsia.\r"

Analysis of the umbilical artery pulsatility index values before and during indomethacin in this subgroup of fetuses failed to reveal a statistically significant change (1.12 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.20).

Twelve cases of postpartum hemorrhage were considered pharmacologic treatment failures, requiring surgical intervention. Among the patients in whom pharmacologic treatment failed were factors that may have played a significant role in the cause of the hemorrhage including peripheral coagulopathy, retained products of conception, lacerations, chorioamnionitis, oxytocin-induced or augmented labor, increased fetal weight, magnesium-treated preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. However, no combination of factors could be consistently associated with pharmacologic treatment failure.\r"

Linear regressions were performed with single parameters, squares, and all possible cross products in the generation of models with log (birth weight) and birth weight as dependent variables. These models were then compared with a group of previously published equations. Clinically, all models performed poorly. However, two models were significantly less accurate in the prediction of birth weight (p less than or equal to 0.05). The best results were obtained by equations that used abdominal circumference and femur length measurements. There was no improvement in models that contained log (birth weight) or birth weight as dependent variables or models with complex variables such as squares or cross products of measured parameters. In conclusion, when evaluating patients at risk of macrosomia, the best estimates of fetal weight can be obtained by models that contain abdominal circumference and femur length.\r"

We have reviewed pregnancies in women with Cushing's syndrome (63 cases from the literature and four cases of our own). Since pregnant women without Cushing's syndrome develop some features of Cushing's syndrome, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and striae, a high index of clinical suspicion must be maintained to prevent delay in diagnosis. The physiologic changes in adrenocorticosteroid metabolism during pregnancy further complicate the diagnosis. Maternal and fetal risks increase markedly when pregnancy does occur in women with hypercortisolism. However, the wide spectrum of severity of the disease mandates an individualized approach to the therapy in each case.\r"

On the whole, square knots proved to be more reliable than sliding knots. Knot performance of surgeon's knots was not better than that of square knots. Knot security of three-throw sliding knots and two-throw square knots and surgeon's knots was rather poor. These knots cannot be recommended for clinical use. In smaller diameter mono- and multifilament suture material, knot performance of sliding knots that contained one extra throw was identical to that of square knots. It is concluded that the outcome of the comparison of square knots and sliding knots depends on knot configuration, suture material, and suture size. The implications of these laboratory findings for clinical use are discussed.\r"

In tissue adjacent to the glaucomatous cups, there was marked disorganization and loss of fibers of elastin within the cores of the cribriform plates. Collagen type VI, normally sparse, increased in quantity considerably throughout the lamina cribrosa in glaucomatous eyes with all degrees of damage. Collagen type IV and other basement membrane macromolecules appeared to extend into nerve bundles, presumably filling in spaces previously occupied by nerves. There was no appreciable change in the postlaminar region, which indicates the specificity of the extracellular matrix changes in the lamina cribrosa. Our results indicate that changes in the extracellular matrix play an important role in the progression of the glaucomatous process and may be a causative agent of the disease.\r"

In part I, three predominant approaches to the psychological treatment of depressive disorders today--psychodynamic, cognitive, and interpersonal--are described and contrasted schematically. They are depicted as conceptually different but potentially complementary with regard to 1) basic characteristics, including theoretical orientation, major strategies, goals, and mechanisms of change, and 2) respective advantages and limitations. This clinical comparison forms the foundation of an integrative and selective model for the treatment of depression.\r"

The DSM-III and DSM-III-R formulations of antisocial personality disorder may encompass two subgroups of substance abusers--\"true\" psychopathic individuals and symptomatic psychopaths with little psychopathy. Psychoneurotic symptoms and favorable treatment responses might be found more often in the latter group.\r"

The intratester variation and reliability of nine different joint measurements was determined in eight healthy subjects. The measurements were taken in eight sessions by each tester. In this population also the intertester variation and reliability was determined by the three observers. This was also done in a population of middle-aged athletes over a period of 2.5 years. The results indicate that it is difficult to show either an improvement or worsening of a joint motion of less than 5 degrees to 10 degrees for most joints measured by the same tester. The intertester variation is not consistent over a longer period of time, so differences between observers during long-term studies cannot be corrected on the basis of a single study at a single point in time. The reliability of all nine joint measurements is not very high, but is probably sufficient if the results are used to compare groups within a single population and for large studies with experienced observers. Because the reliability strongly depends on the interindividual variation, it is preferable to determine the reliability for each study population.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 72 acute ACL injuries in 70 athletically active patients (50 recreational and 20 competitive athletes) treated with primary repair and semitendinosus tendon augmentation was conducted (mean follow-up time, 38.5 months). All patients had open primary multiple loop depth-varying suture repair and semitendinosus tendon augmentation at a mean injury to surgery interval of 9.1 days. Fifty-one cases (70.8%) were supplemented with an extraarticular procedure consisting in all cases of an iliotibial band lateral sling reinforcement. All patients underwent 6 weeks of postoperative immobilization followed by a graduated rehabilitation regimen lasting a mean 7.2 months. In 22 of the ACL tears, no other associated injury could be defined at arthrotomy, while in 27, significant medial collateral ligament injuries were noted. Lateral meniscal injuries (24) were more commonly noted than medial meniscal injuries (19). Good to excellent subjective results were reported in 82%, while 77.1% returned to preinjury sport level and participation without limitation. One patient developed \"giving way\" symptoms and overall, only four patients did not return to sports participation. Objective examination revealed 93.1% to have a 1+ or less Lachman test and 86.1% to have a negative pivot shift. Of 60 knees tested, 93.3% had KT-1000 side-to-side difference values (measured at 25 degrees +/- 5 degrees of flexion with an 89 N load) of less than or equal to 3 mm of anterior displacement. A 100 point Hospital for Special Surgery ligament rating score was used with 25 points assigned to subjective, 45 points to objective, and 30 points to functional assessment. The mean score at followup was 93.1. Analysis of results in patients with or without an extraarticular reinforcement revealed no difference in objective outcome. The incidence of patellofemoral pain was 27.8%. Thirty knees had some degree of loss of range of motion. Loss of terminal flexion was noted in 29, while 5 had loss of terminal extension. No correlation could be found between patellofemoral pain and diminished range of motion. Generalized ligamentous laxity was found in 37.1% of the patients; this was not associated with a poor result. This study suggests that primary repair with semitendinosus tendon augmentation of acute ACL injuries with a graduated rehabilitation regimen provides good subjective, and excellent functional and objective, results in active patients that were followed for more than 3 years.\r"

Chronic deep posterior compartment syndrome as a cause of medial leg pain is still controversial. The problems of deep posterior compartment pressure measurement contribute to this controversy. These problems include safety of catheter insertion and the possibility that the patient has more than one deep posterior compartment. In this paper, we present a new technique for catheter placement in which continuous ultrasound guidance is used. This technique allows for the safe placement of the catheter into the deep posterior compartment and for documentation of catheter tip location.\r"

Anti-CS IgG were present in hemolymph immediately upon cessation of mosquito feeding. Titers peaked at 3 hr post-ingestion then declined steadily, becoming negligible at 18 hr. Substantial titers were present in the bloodmeal at 24 hr post-ingestion. By 48 hr, anti-CS IgG in both mosquito hemolymph and bloodmeal were virtually absent. Estimated quantities of anti-CS IgG in the hemolymph at 3 hr post-ingestion were 905-958 ng/ml, representing approximately 0.5% of that present in the host serum. Rat IgG subclasses 1, 2a, and 2b passed into hemolymph more readily than did IgM and possibly IgG2c. Hemolymph volume of unengorged mosquitoes (0.53 microliters) increased after a bloodmeal (0.73 microliters at 3 hr post-ingestion), suggesting that anti-CS IgG may move into the hemocoel in an aqueous solution.\r"

These peptides specifically inhibited the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the P. vivax CS protein in Western blots. However, when D4 and DDAAD peptides were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of human antibodies, more sera bound to the DDAAD (61%) than to the D4 peptide (22%). This binding was specific, and suggested that the DDAAD peptide contained epitopes constituted by the sequential array of DRADGQPAG and DRAAGQPAG repeat variants and absent in the D4 peptide. The ELISA using the DDAAD peptide was applied to the detection of P. vivax CS protein antibodies in a large number of sera from Kataragama, an endemic area in Sri Lanka. The prevalence of these antibodies increased with age, reaching 40% in adults greater than 50 years old. The ELISA employing the DDAAD peptide represents a simple and useful tool for the analysis of the antibody response to P. vivax sporozoites in naturally exposed individuals.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relationship between exposure to malaria, the use of long-term chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine, and the prevalence of sporozoite antibodies in 446 expatriates who had lived in 7 West African countries for 6 months-41 years. Filter paper blood samples from 12% of the subjects had antibodies to the repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, with a positive correlation between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) absorbance and years of exposure (r = 0.32, P = less than 0.01). Development of sporozoite antibodies did not correlate with reported use of chloroquine. Ten samples from expatriates with the highest ELISA titers and 10 samples from West African nationals, which were matched for ELISA titer and duration of exposure, were characterized more fully. All 20 samples reacted strongly with sporozoites by immunofluorescence. The 10 samples from nationals reacted strongly with liver-stage antigens by immunofluorescence and with blood-stage antigens by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. In contrast, the 10 samples from expatriates were negative or only weakly positive in the liver- and blood-stage assays. These results imply that sporozoite antibodies are generally not cross-reactive with blood-stage antigens, and suggest that protective immunity to malaria does not develop during long-term malaria chemoprophylaxis against the erythrocytic stage.\r"

  ".W": "Between 18 June and 20 September 1986, 28 cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria were documented in Carlsbad, California, a coastal town north of San Diego. Malaria occurred in 1 local resident who had no risk factors, a second local resident who had traveled to a malarious area 9 months earlier, and 26 Mexican migrant workers (MWs). Among the 28 cases, 27 lived in a square mile marshy area where Anopheles hermsi, a newly described American species of the Anopheles maculipennis group, was known to be breeding. An investigation of MWs residing in the affected area was done to determine the extent of the outbreak and to identify risk factors for acquiring malaria. We interviewed and drew blood from 304 healthy MWs and 17 (65%) of the MWs with malaria. Fluorescent antibody titers to P. vivax greater than or equal to 1:256 occurred in 14 (82%) of the 17 MWs with malaria tested and 9 (3%) of the healthy MWs. The principal risk factor identified for contracting malaria was sleeping outside on a hillside adjacent to the marshy area. Malaria in a local resident with no malaria risk factors and the clustering in time and place of 26 cases suggest that P. vivax malaria was introduced and local transmission was sustained through several generations, producing the largest outbreak of introduced malaria in the United States since 1952.\r"

The authors conclude that the issuance of the release was premature and that it does not attempt to balance the slight lengthening of disease-free survival against the overall population costs. It is suggested that physicians individually assess the potential merits of such a treatment regimen in each of their patients with node-negative breast cancer.\r"

Three of 7 non-ECMO-treated infants and 14 of 17 ECMO-treated infants had an air- or fluid-filled mediastinal mass that was confirmed by an upper gastrointestinal series as ectatic esophagus. Contrast studies demonstrated severe gastroesophageal reflux. Intra-esophageal pH monitoring confirmed significant reflux (Euler scores greater than 50) in 69% of tested patients. Prolonged acid clearance in most patients implied abnormal peristalsis. Hydramnios was correlated to the observed esophageal abnormalities, being present in 13 of 16 infants with an available amniotic history. All patients had symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux managed without antireflux surgery and were discharged 36 +/- 2 days after initiation of feeding. Follow-up (range: 7 to 56 months; mean: 32 months) showed that weight gain in affected children was slower than in those not affected. All but one are asymptomatic. Repeat upper gastrointestinal series shows persistent ectasia but less gastro-esophageal reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux/ectasia is a new observation with CDH. The associated hydramnios may result from proximal foregut obstruction by kinking the gastroesophageal junction with CDH. The radiographic appearance can be quite unusual. Clinical manifestations of gastro-esophageal reflux are manageable without surgery but may account for the observed compromised growth.\r"

There were no deaths, and no patient required reoperation or drainage of a subhepatic collection. Wound infections occurred in eight patients with drains and in six patients without. Most infections were staphylococcal. Postoperative pulmonary complications and hospital stays were similar in patients with and without drains. Statistical analysis of the 10 available prospective controlled randomized studies (1,920 patients) by the method of odds ratios supported our findings. Simple elective cholecystectomy is safe without peritoneal drainage, but short-term drains do not increase morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic endocrine tumors are grouped together by their common histologic, cytochemical, and ultrastructural features. Although useful conceptually, this paradigm has been unable to predict the anatomic location of different tumor types. Successful surgical excision of these tumors would be facilitated by an improved understanding of their anatomic distribution. Based on the available data, a bimodal distribution of pancreatic endocrine tumors was identified. Cluster 1 (gastrinomas, pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-secreting tumors, somatostatinomas) had 75% of tumors to the right of the superior mesenteric artery, whereas cluster 2 (insulinoma, glucagonoma) had 75% of tumors to the left of the superior mesenteric artery (p less than 0.05). This distribution is similar to that distribution predicted based on the volume density of the corresponding islet cells for insulinoma, glucagonoma, and PP-secreting tumors, but not for somatostatinoma. These findings suggest that pancreatic endocrine tumors are derived from similar cytologic precursors as pancreatic islet cells, and their distribution may be a consequence of embryologic development from either the ventral (cluster 1) or dorsal (cluster 2) pancreatic buds.\r"

Auscultation of the lungs resulted in a wrong conclusion in 15% (6-30, 95% confidence limits) of the cases when the oesophagus was ventilated: the sounds were misinterpretated as normal breath sounds. Suction on the tubes with a 60-ml syringe was also a reliable test. Other methods assessed were observation for condensation of water vapor, and abnormal movements of the upper abdomen; these were unreliable.\r"

Forty-six patients were allocated randomly to receive either alfentanil 10 micrograms/kg or saline just before a rapid sequence induction with propofol. Suxamethonium 1 mg/kg was given and infusions of suxamethonium 10 mg/minute and propofol (10 mg/kg/hour for 10 minutes, 8 mg/kg/hour for 10 minutes and then 6 mg/kg/hour thereafter) were started. There were 23 patients in each group with no significant demographic differences between the groups. A significantly mean lower induction dose of propofol was needed in the alfentanil group (1.7 mg/kg compared to 2.2 mg/kg). Cardiovascular measurements were made on the ward pre-operatively, just before induction, just after induction, just after intubation, and at 3-minute intervals thereafter. Arterial pressure was significantly lower during the procedure in the patients who received alfentanil and there was a significant incidence of hypotension. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of heart rate, with a significant increase in both groups just after intubation compared to the baseline values. Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed using the critical flicker fusion threshold. No differences were found between the groups and patients in both groups had returned to baseline values by 60 minutes. No patient had any recall of intra-operative events, and there were no other adverse effects of any significance.\r"

  ".W": "Among the main causes for the relatively small number of organ donors, the delay in the diagnosis of brain death plays a major role. This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether pulsed Doppler mean and phasic common carotid blood flow (CCBF) combined with arterial and jugular venous blood gases could rapidly and specifically establish a diagnosis of brain death. CCBF was measured by an 8 MHz pulsed Doppler flowmeter, allowing measurement of the vessel diameter via a double transducer probe, which fixed the ultrasonic incidence angle. From an initial series of patients (n = 28) with an established diagnosis [brain death n = 14; severe coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 7, n = 14], the results of the logistic regression analysis process yielded the most discriminating parameters for brain death diagnosis: end-diastolic velocity (Ved - 1.4 vs. 12.7 cm/s; t = 7.67, P = 0.001) and blood flow (Qed - 13.6 vs. 121.4 ml/min). These parameters were then tested in a blind fashion on a second series of 28 comatose patients (GCS = 7). They resulted in correct diagnosis (brain death n = 14 or severe coma n = 14) for all patients. Brain death diagnosis was confirmed by clinical signs, EEG, and/or angiography. From the analysis of the overall population (n = 56), a value of Qed of less than 31.4 ml/mn indictes brain death. The authors conclude, that pulsed Doppler measurements of CCBF represent an early, low cost and noninvasive technique, the results of which may prompt legally accepted procedures, which in turn would reduce the delay required before brain death is diagnosed. Moreover, this technique could help in deciding on discontinuation of active therapy in severely injured patients.\r"

Thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.75% bupivacaine with hyaluronidase 15 units/ml (pH 5.45 +/- 0.12) or the same pH-adjusted solution (0.15 mEq sodium bicarbonate per 30 ml of 0.75% bupivacaine to give a final pH of 6.82 +/- 0.09) in a double-blind, prospective manner. Onset of akinesia was determined to the nearest minute. Supplemental injections were given after 20 min in the event of incomplete akinesia. The group receiving pH-adjusted bupivacaine had a statistically faster onset time for complete akinesia than did the control group (5.3 +/- 1.2 min vs. 14.3 +/- 2.3 min, respectively; P less than 0.001). Five of 17 patients in the control group required a supplemental injection, whereas only one of 17 patients in the treatment group had a supplemental block at 20 min (P less than 0.05). Thus, pH adjustment of a solution of bupivacaine and hyaluronidase with sodium bicarbonate hastens the onset time and improves the initial success rate of peribulbar block.\r"

All received general anesthesia with halothane, N2O, and O2; tracheal intubation was facilitated with intravenous (iv) atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Intravenous atropine 0.02 mg/kg and lactated Ringer's solution with 5% dextrose equivalent to 4 h of maintenance fluids were administered during surgery. Neither opioids nor droperidol were given intraoperatively. At the completion of surgery, residual muscle paralysis was reversed with atropine 0.02 mg/kg (maximum dose 1.0 mg) and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (maximum dose 5.0 mg), and the stomach was decompressed prior to tracheal extubation. After the patient had been transferred to the postanesthesia recovery room (PARR) either metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg or normal saline was administered intravenously to the children over a 1-min period. A research associate monitored the children for the incidence of post-operative vomiting and the time required for each child to meet discharge criteria from Short Stay Recovery Unit (SSRU). If a child vomited more than three times in both the PARR and SSRU, the vomiting was construed to be severe and the patient was offered further antiemetic treatment with iv droperidol 70 micrograms/kg. The incidence of postoperative vomiting in the metoclopramide group was 37% versus 59% in the placebo group (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The children were assigned to one of four groups, each of which was anesthetized with 1% halothane and 50% nitrous oxide.

Group 2 (n = 21) was identical to group 1 but did not receive atropine prior to the simulated intravascular test dose. Groups 3 (n = 12) and 4 (n = 11) were identical to groups 1 and 2, but the simulated intravascular test dose did not contain epinephrine: group 3 received atropine prior to the test dose and group 4 did not. The simulated intravascular test dose increased heart rate in group 1 (with atropine) at each time period from 15 to 120 s, but only at 45 and 60 s in group 2 (without atropine). Following the iv test dose, 6 of 21 children in group 2 had an increase in heart rate of less than 10 beats/min, while only one child in group 1 had an increase in heart rate of less than 10 beats/min. Intravenous test doses that did not contain epinephrine (groups 3 and 4) had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure. Atropine, 10 micrograms/kg, improves the reliability of an epidural test dose in children anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide but does not ensure total reliability in detecting an intravascular injection.\r"

The rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in the study population were so low (less than 0.15%) that no conclusions regarding the relative rates of these outcomes among the four anesthetic agents could be reached. The rates of 16 of 66 types of adverse outcomes in the study population were significantly different among the four study agents. Most of these outcomes were minor. However, severe ventricular arrhythmia (P less than 10(-6)) was more common with halothane, severe hypertension (P less than 10(-6)) and severe bronchospasm (P = 0.028) were more common with fentanyl, and severe tachycardia (P = 0.001) was more common with isoflurane. Recovery from anesthesia during the first 30 min was slowest in those patients who received halothane (P less than or equal to 0.001). In addition, patients who received fentanyl experienced less pain during the first hour in the recovery room (P less than 10(-6)).

A blinded observer using a behavioral scale for rating pain in children performed assessments of behavior and pain before and following venous cannulation.

  ".W": "Indirect and experimental evidence suggests that polymorphonuclear leukocytes, responding to an activating signal presumably related to the complement cascade activation, are involved in the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathologic changes seem to be result of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte margination within the pulmonary capillary vessels and their activation with subsequent release of vasoactive peptides (thromboxane A2, prostaglandin E2) and toxic intracellular compounds. This study confirms that adherence, chemotaxis, and chemiluminescence are increased in polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients with ARDS. Enhanced chemotactic and chemiluminescence capacities are likely specific to ARDS, whereas increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adherence seems to be nonspecific. If increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation is important in the pathogenesis of ARDS, the inhibition of this phenomenon could play a therapeutic role. This double-blind prospective study was undertaken to assess if polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity is inhibited in vivo by the iv administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in patients with ARDS. A continuous infusion of PGE1 at a dose of 30 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 7 days did not modify the functional activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in patients with ARDS. Because hemodynamic instability was seen during infusion of this dose of PGE1, an increased dose was not tested. At the dose of PGE1 tested, no significant effect upon the function activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in patients with ARDS could be demonstrated.\r"

Forty-five patients scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were randomly divided into three groups of 15 patients each: 1) removal of platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 2) removal of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and 3) no plasmapheresis (control group). Plasma volume removed was 10 ml/kg in all APP patients, and plasma was replaced by the same amount of low-molecular weight hydroxyethylstarch solution (6% HES 200/0.5). Various laboratory data were investigated before, during, and after extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Blood loss in control patients was more pronounced than in the two APP groups; two of the control patients needed packed red cells. APP itself did not affect coagulation variables, free hemoglobin, or polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase. At the end of the operation, 5 h after ECC, and at the first postoperative day the number of platelets was significantly lower in the control group; PRP patients showed the highest values. Fibrinogen and AT-III levels were less compromised in APP patients than in the control group. Global coagulation parameters did not differ between the groups within the whole investigation period. PMN elastase increased significantly during ECC in all groups with the greatest increase in the control group (722%) and the smallest increase in PRP patients (280%), possibly due to the removal of cellular elements in this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no difference between groups for RR, Spo2, incidence or frequency of slow respiratory rate (SRR, 5-min mean RR less than 10) and apneas (AP, greater than or equal to 15 s of less than 100 ml tidal volume), incidence of nausea and/or vomiting, pruritus, or hypotension, and hours asleep or drowsy. There were no major respiratory abnormalities. During control monitoring of nine EP and 11 IM subjects while asleep postoperatively, the RR, Spo2, and incidence and frequency of SRR and AP were similar to the study period in both groups. In conclusion, EP morphine was a more effective analgesic than IM morphine, but the side effects of both were similar.\r"

Recently, the delivery system for this preparation has been modified for use in allergic rhinitis. A total of 180 adult patients with symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients received either placebo or approximately 25 mg per actuation of triamcinolone acetonide aerosol per nostril, qid, for 4 weeks. Each patient kept a daily diary rating rhinitis symptoms. Both the patient and the physician also gave global evaluations of drug efficacy. Of 168 evaluable patients, significant reductions were seen at week 1, week 2, and in the overall study evaluation of ratings for intensity (P less than .001) and duration (P less than .05) of various rhinitis symptoms such as nasal stuffiness, discharge, and sneezing in the group given triamcinolone acetonide. Superiority to placebo group was evident as early as day 1 and maintained throughout the study. Both patients and physicians rated triamcinolone acetonide as significantly more effective than placebo for the duration of the study (P less than .001). There was a marked reduction in nasal smear eosinophils in the triamcinolone acetonide group. There was no difference between groups in safety evaluations including no evidence of suppression of the adrenal axis and no evidence of fungal infection. This study demonstrates that triamcinolone acetonide in a dose of 25 micrograms per nostril, qid, is effective, well tolerated, and safe in reducing symptoms in adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.\r"

The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, and extent of burn. Wounds of patients in group 1 (30) were compared with those of group 2 (26) for healing time, pain, compliance with scheduled visits, and costs. Infected and skin-grafted wounds were excluded from healing time analysis. Infection rates of the two groups were similar (three of 30 vs two of 26). One patient in each group underwent skin grafting. Healing times of group 1 wounds were significantly less than those of group 2 (10.6 +/- 0.8 vs 15.0 +/- 1.2 days, P less than .01). Using a pain scale of 1 to 5, Biobrane-treated patients averaged lower pain scores at 24 hours after the burn (1.6 +/- 0.8 vs 3.6 +/- 1.3 P less than .001) and used less pain medication. Compliance with scheduled outpatient visits was also improved in the Biobrane-treated group (88.6% vs 63.2% attendance, P less than .001). Idealized total treatment costs averaged $434 for patients in group 1 compared with $504 for patients in group 2. We conclude that when used on properly selected wounds, Biobrane therapy can significantly decrease pain and total healing time without increasing the cost of outpatient burn care. Improved patient compliance may be an added benefit.\r"

Indicator dilution studies were performed using 51Cr-erythrocytes, 125I-albumin, 14C-urea, and 3H-water as tracers. The injectate was infused as a bolus into a central venous line. Peripheral arterial blood was collected and counted for radioactivity. Mathematical analysis of the indicator curves yielded cardiac output, measures of the product of capillary permeability and surface area for urea (PS and D1/2S), the intravascular lung volume (Vv), and the extravascular lung water volume (Ve). Permeability was separated from surface area by normalizing PS and D1/2S to Vv. Patients could be divided into 16 in whom blood gas determinations and radiologic criteria for ARDS were reversed and 23 in whom they were not. We examined indicator dilution and other measures of lung function in the two groups to determine whether significant differences in microvascular function existed. PS and PS/Vv were significantly higher in the nonreversal patients. Ve was above normal, but not different between groups. Linear regression analysis showed significant correlations for all of the following in the nonreversal group: Ve and all measures of permeability, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and the inverse of permeability-surface area measures and AaDO2 and PVR. Only measures of Ve and PS correlated in the reversal group. These results support the hypothesis that capillary permeability is increased in patients with early ARDS and continuing respiratory failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic hyperinflation and the development of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) are commonly observed in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory failure. The presence of intrinsic PEEP acts as an inspiratory threshold load, and contributes significantly to the observed increase in work and oxygen cost of breathing. The present study examined the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (at 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O) and its ability to reduce the mechanical load imposed by PEEPi on breathing pattern, work of breathing, and dyspnea in seven patients with severe COPD during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Tidal volume remained stable at all levels of applied pressure. Breathing frequency was also stable except for a small (12%) decrease during CPAP of 15 cm H2O. Inspiratory pulmonary resistance and elastance were unaltered by the application of CPAP. There were progressive reductions in the inspiratory work of breathing as the level of CPAP increased. At the highest level of CPAP, the amount of inspiratory work performed per minute and per liter of ventilation decreased by 49.8 and 41.8%, respectively. Similar progressive reductions were also obtained in the pressure-time product for the inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm, which amounted to decreases of 42.9 and 42.2%, respectively, at the highest level of CPAP. End-expiratory lung volume remained stable at the lowest level of CPAP, with only modest increases occurring at the higher levels. In addition, all patients reported a reduction in dyspnea during the administration of CPAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a new form of mechanical ventilatory support that assists a patient's spontaneous ventilatory effort with a clinician-selected amount of inspiratory pressure. In order to assess the muscle unloading effect and the ventilatory pattern response to increasing levels of this inspiratory pressure assist, we first utilized a computer respiratory system model with variable alveolar ventilation demands and impedances. From this model, we calculated ventilatory muscle loads (expressed either as the work/min or as the pressure time index) during simulated, unassisted breathing and during simulated breathing with levels of inspiratory pressure assist up to that which resulted in a VT of 800 ml and no work being performed by the muscles (defined as PSVmax for the model conditions being studied). The optimal ventilatory pattern (i.e., frequency-tidal volume) under each ventilation and impedance condition was defined as that which resulted in minimal muscle load. Under these model conditions, we found that PSVmax ranged from 5 to 41 cm H2O and that as the level of inspiratory pressure assist was increased from zero to PSVmax, there was a biphasic response of both the ventilatory muscle loading and the ventilatory pattern. Specifically, at low levels of inspiratory pressure assist, the model predicted that the applied pressure would only partially unload the ventilatory muscles. Continued muscle energy expenditure would thus still be required, whereas the ventilatory pattern would change little. Conversely, at higher levels of inspiratory pressure assist, the model predicted that the applied pressure would be sufficient to completely unload the ventilatory muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "After an average follow-up of 6.5 yr (range 1 to 13), 48 of 48 patients with cedar asthma, who were still working in the same industry, were re-examined. In all of them, the diagnosis of cedar asthma had been confirmed with a specific challenge inhalation test with plicatic acid. We graded the severity of asthma symptoms and the requirement for antiasthma medications at the time of diagnosis and at the time of follow-up visit. Spirometry and measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine (PC20 methacholine) were also done on both visits. The increase or decrease in asthma symptoms, medications requirement, FEV1 and PC20 methacholine between the follow-up and the diagnostic visit were used to determine the outcome of the patients. Using these parameters, 10.4% of patients improved, 62.5% remained stable, 37.5% deteriorated, and none recovered. Among the characteristics of the patients observed at the time of diagnosis, the age of the patient, the atopic status, smoking habit, and the presence of specific IgE to plicatic acid were not useful in predicting the eventual outcome. Reduction of exposure by transfer to a less dusty job and the use of an airstream helmet did not prevent deterioration of asthma. Only the use of the twin-cartridge respirator was associated with a favorable outcome. We conclude that among cedar asthmatics who remained exposed to cedar dust for an average of 6.5 yr, over one-third showed marked deterioration of their asthma symptoms. There is also no way to predict who will deteriorate. A decrease in the amount of exposure to cedar dust does not prevent deterioration of asthma. This suggests that the ideal management of cedar asthma is removal from exposure.\r"

Human volunteers inhaled PAF, given as six successive inhalations 15 min apart, followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 4 h later. The mean density and volume of circulating neutrophils were measured by metrizamide gradients and flow cytometry, respectively. PAF caused a decrease in Vp20 of 38.2 +/- 4.5% at 5 min after the first inhalation (p less than 0.001). This was associated with a fall in the peripheral blood neutrophil count from 3.15 +/- 0.3 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) per ml (p less than 0.001), followed by a rebound neutrophilia (p less than 0.01). The mean density of peripheral blood neutrophils fell significantly at 15 min (p less than 0.02), with a return to baseline values despite further PAF inhalations; this was associated with an increase in neutrophil volume (n = 4; p less than 0.05). The numbers of neutrophils (x 10(5] in BAL fluid after PAF were significantly greater than after inhalation of lyso-PAF: 7.1 +/- 1.4 (n = 7) versus 1.3 +/- 0.3 (n = 5, p less than 0.01); eosinophil counts did not change significantly. The PC40 (the concentration of methacholine needed to cause a fall in Vp30) decreased from 17.1 (GSEM 1.40) to 8.7 (1.44) mg/ml (n = 12, p less than 0.02) 3 days after PAF.

Twenty-one patients were entered into the study, all receiving assisted ventilation and inhaled bronchodilators because of airflow limitation. The average age was 68 yr; there were 10 men and 11 women. The patients were randomized to receive either 4 puffs (800 micrograms) of radiolabeled fenoterol by MDI of 1.75 ml (1,750 micrograms) of radiolabeled fenoterol solution by nebulizer. Imaging of lung fields was made by a portable scintillation camera at 5-min intervals during the study. Results showed that 20 patients completed the study, 9 receiving fenoterol by MDI, and 11 by jet nebulizer. Four were excluded from analysis because of previous pneumonectomy, two from each group. Lung deposition measured as a percent of given dose from either system was 5.65 +/- 1.09 (mean +/- SEM) for MDI plus extension chamber and 1.22 +/- 0.35 for jet nebulizer (p less than 0.001). Therefore, this trial shows significantly greater efficiency of aerosol deposition to the lung in ventilator-dependent patients when using an MDI plus aerosol holding chamber than when using a jet nebulizer.\r"

PFT included the measurements of total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), FEV1, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. No difference was found between the respiratory clearance of 113mIn-DTPA (2.25 +/- 1.00%/min) and RC-Tc-DTPA (2.29 +/- 1.11%/min) in eight patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Pulmonary function decreased 15% or more in at least 2 function tests during 11 follow-up periods, but it remained stable during 47 follow-up periods. In patients whose lung function deteriorated, RC-Tc-DTPA increased to 3.51 +/- 1.55%/min; in contrast, in patients whose lung function remained stable, regardless of the initial values, RC-Tc-DTPA was normal (1.00 +/- 0.50%/min; p less than 0.001). In eight patients who were treated with corticosteroids, RC-Tc-DTPA decreased from 3.48 +/- 1.31%/min to 1.56 +/- 0.64%/min (p less than 0.001), and PFT improved. We conclude that in nonsmokers with pulmonary sarcoidosis, increased RC-Tc-DTPA is not related to dissociation of 99mTc from DTPA, RC-Tc-DTPA is increased when pulmonary function decreases, and, when increased, RC-Tc-DTPA decreases with corticosteroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Phagocytes, in particular macrophages and PMN, are now recognized as major components of inflammatory and immunologic reactions in the lung. Normally, macrophages represent the majority of phagocytes in the lower respiratory tract. These lung macrophages are morphologically and functionally heterogenous and include alveolar, interstitial, intravascular, and airway macrophages, each with characteristic morphologic and functional features. Through the presence of surface receptors for numerous ligands and through their large number of secretory products, lung macrophages can respond to environmental factors and account for most of the clearance of microparticles and microorganisms in the distal airways and the alveolar spaces. In addition, macrophages also play an important role in inflammatory processes through the release of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes. Through the release of several cytokines, i.e., growth-promoting and inhibiting factors, lung macrophages may also influence both matrix damage and repair processes. Macrophages can also contribute to the alveolitis by recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells. This latter contribution is best demonstrated in migration movement of PMN. The normal distal airways generally contain a small number of PMN, but the pulmonary vascular bed represents a large reservoir of PMN. Some of them are in intimate contact with the endothelium, forming the so-called marginating pool of PMN. Because the capillary lumen is separated only from the alveolar space by a monolayer of endothelial and epithelial cells on each side of a thin interstitial matrix, it is likely that some inhibitory mechanism exists to prevent PMN from migrating towards the alveolar space. Such inhibitors of PMN migration are present both in serum and in the alveolar space, some being released by alveolar macrophages. However, alveolar macrophages can also secrete factors called chemotaxins that attract PMN to the airways, and this supports a central role for alveolar macrophages in the regulation of PMN traffic in the lungs. Thus, secretory products of alveolar macrophages are part of the regulatory mechanisms of PMN mobility and adherence that appears to be crucial in the initiation of some inflammatory reactions. The contribution of phagocytes to the defense against infection and tumor has been documented mostly in vitro. Thus, both oxygen radicals, in particular hydroxyl radicals and proteases such as lysozyme, are potent bactericidal agents. That phagocytes are also important defenders of the lungs in vivo is best supported by the observations in immunodeficient patients and animal models.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Those afflicted with the more common neurogenic form of AMC can have otolaryngologic manifestations. Here, a case of AMC with severe otolaryngologic manifestations is reported. The clinically relevant findings included an expressionless face, micrognathia, poor suck reflex, high arched palate, and an omega-shaped epiglottis, but otherwise normal larynx, trachea, and esophagus by endoscopic examination. Airway compromise, achalasia, aspiration pneumonitis, and poor nutrition were constant problems. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy were subsequently placed, and the patient's clinical course eventually improved. Early involvement of the otolaryngologist and placement of a tracheostomy and gastrostomy are recommended in those patients with severe otolaryngologic manifestations of AMC.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated increased immunoreactivity of the endogenous opioid peptide beta-endorphin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infants under 2 years of age with apnea. To assess the role of endogenous opioids in the pathogenesis of apnea in children, the effect of oral treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone was studied in apneic infants, as well as in older apneic children, with demonstrated increases in CSF immunoreactive beta-endorphin (i-BE). In the 8 apneic infants with elevated i-BE in lumbar CSF (range, 55-155 pg/ml; normal, 17-52 pg/ml), no further apnea occurred during naltrexone therapy (1 mg/kg/day, by mouth). Five children (2-8 years old) with apnea of unknown cause had elevated CSF i-BE (range, 74-276 pg/ml) compared to 6 age-matched nonapneic children (range, 15-48 pg/ml). No apneic events occurred during naltrexone therapy, except in 1 child during stressful events, but apnea recurred in some patients after attempts to discontinue naltrexone treatment. Adverse effects of naltrexone included complaints of headaches in 2 children and symptoms of a narcotic withdrawal syndrome during the first 3 days of treatment in 1 child. Three children with Leigh's syndrome had elevated CSF i-BE (range, 104-291 pg/ml) and their apnea also responded to naltrexone. We conclude that elevated endogenous opioids contribute to the pathogenesis of apnea in children and may even result in physical dependence.\r"

  ".W": "A sulfathiazole-resistant strain of Escherichia coli was isolated and shown to contain a fourfold tandemly amplified segment of DNA 18 kilobase pairs in length in addition to a mutationally altered dihydropteroate synthase, the target enzyme for sulfonamide inhibition. The amplified DNA contained a gene designated sur that contributed to sulfathiazole resistance when present in greater amounts than those in the wild type. Sulfathiazole resistance was markedly decreased upon loss of the amplified DNA after nonselective growth. Plasmids that contained sur also conferred only weak sulfathiazole resistance on wild-type strains. Comparison of the restriction maps of the amplified DNA, wild-type DNA, and sur-containing plasmids showed that a DNA rearrangement occurred before or concomitant with the DNA amplification event. The DNA rearrangement resulted from an IS5 insertion, which, in conjunction with an IS5 element residing near sur in the wild-type strain, resulted in an -IS5-sur-IS5- configuration. Homologous recombination could account for duplication and subsequent amplification of the sur region. High-copy-number plasmids containing the sur locus did not express a sulfathiazole-resistant dihydropteroate synthase, nor did they overexpress wild-type dihydropteroate synthase. These data suggest that the high level of sulfathiazole resistance in this strain results from a synergistic effect of two different mutations.\r"

BSS was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. A 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mM aqueous suspension of BSS was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) Escherichia coli cells per ml. Binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria, and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) E. coli per ml. Intracellular ATP decreased rapidly after exposure of E. coli to 10 mM BSS and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. Extracellular ATP increased after exposure to BSS, but the accumulation of extracellular ATP was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular ATP. The killing of bacteria exposed to BSS may have been due to cessation of ATP synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. Bactericidal activity of BSS was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at pH 3. Killing of E. coli at this pH was much more rapid than at pH 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of BSS to bismuth oxychloride. It is proposed that the binding and killing observed for BSS contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.\r"

The plasmid-borne gene encoding SHV-3 has been cloned, and the primary structure of the enzyme was deduced from its nucleotide sequence. SHV-3 differs from SHV-1 in two positions. The extended substrate profile of SHV-3 probably results from the substitution of Ser-213 for Gly, as in SHV-2, whereas replacement of Arg-180 by Leu resulted in a decrease in the pI from 7.6 to 7.0. The blashv-3 gene is highly homologous (92% DNA sequence identity) with the chromosomal gene coding for LEN-1 beta-lactamase of K. pneumoniae, suggesting that the origin of the SHV-encoding genes now present on many plasmids may be chromosomal.\r"

Activated DNA as a heteropolymeric substrate was used as efficiently as was the homopolymeric substrate poly(rA)-oligo(dT). The Michaelis-Menten constants were determined for each of the four nucleotides needed to elongate a natural template primer. Azidothymidine triphosphate, a well-known inhibitor of the enzyme, inhibited the enzyme competitively with respect to dTTP and noncompetitively with respect to the other nucleotides. Azidothymidine triphosphate acted as an efficient inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase gamma, whereas other enzymes of eucaryotic DNA metabolism, namely, DNA polymerase alpha-primase and DNA polymerase beta, were not inhibited. This finding may explain why some acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients suffer side effects during azidothymidine therapy.\r"

An in vivo rifampin-resistant isolate displayed markedly reduced susceptibility to rifampin compared with an in vivo-susceptible strain. This system appears to be highly suitable for in vitro drug susceptibility testing of M. leprae.\r"

At 28 +/- 7 days after treatment, complete resolution had occurred in 181 (91%) of 199 patients treated with permethrin and in 176 (86%) of 205 patients given lindane. Pruritis due to scabies persisted at 28 +/- 7 days in 14% of the permethrin group and in 25% of the lindane group. The most frequent adverse effects were new or increased pruritus and mild, transient burning or stinging; the latter was slightly more frequent following permethrin treatment and appeared to be related to severity of infestation. Because of a lower potential for neurologic toxicity, permethrin may be preferable to lindane for the treatment of scabies particularly in children.\r"

  ".W": "A double blind trial was conducted to determine the effect of fenfluramine on the weight and behaviour of patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome. Fifteen subjects, aged 5.5 to 27 years, received the placebo and the active drug, each for a period of six weeks. The dose of fenfluramine varied according to the age of the patient. Treatment with fenfluramine was associated with significant weight loss, improvement in food related behaviour, and a decrease in aggressive behaviour directed towards others. Skin picking and other self mutilation were unaffected by the drug. None of the subjects suffered from any side effects while taking the drug. These findings suggest that short term treatment with fenfluramine may have a role in the management of some patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. It could be used during periods when exposure to large amounts of food cannot be avoided and aggressive behaviour is particularly difficult to contain. It may also be useful in those whose lives are threatened by the complications of obesity.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of dipyridamole (5 mg/kg/day) for 12 months on renal and platelet function in 53 children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in a prospective double blind placebo controlled trial. Urine albumin excretion (expressed as the geometric mean albumin to creatinine concentration ratio (UA/UC) was measured every three months throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean UA/UC was no different in diabetic children receiving dipyridamole, 0.60 mg/mmol, when compared with those receiving placebo, 0.87 mg/mmol. Glomerular filtration rate, urinary excretion of retinol binding protein, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), blood pressure, and spontaneous platelet aggregation in response to stirring whole blood did not differ between the two groups at 12 months. Subgroup analysis to include only those children with high UA/UC before entry into the study also failed to show an effect of the drug on UA/UC. Eleven children had either persistently high UA/UC (n = 8: four on dipyridamole, four on placebo) or progression to high UA/UC (n = 3: two on dipyridamole, one on placebo). These children had significantly higher urinary excretion of retinol binding protein and NAG, bigger kidneys, and higher diastolic blood pressure both before and after treatment than the remaining 42 children, whereas there was no difference in spontaneous platelet aggregation between the two groups. These observations on the associations between UA/UC and other parameters of renal function suggest that measurement of 'tubular' proteins and diastolic blood pressure as well as UA/UC may contribute to the identification of those at risk of developing nephropathy.\r"

Because the underlying injuries and their treatment may differ considerably, the nonoperative or operative approach to the common hematomas is based on mechanism of injury coupled with hemodynamic status of the patient and extent of associated injuries. After blunt trauma, selected retroperitoneal hematomas in the lateral perirenal and pelvic areas do not require operation and should not be opened if discovered at operation. Midline, lateral paraduodenal, lateral pericolonic not associated with pelvic, and portal hematomas are opened after proximal vascular control has been obtained, if appropriate. Retrohepatic hematomas without obvious active hemorrhage are not opened. After penetrating trauma, most retroperitoneal hematomas are still opened. Exceptions include isolated lateral perirenal hematomas that have been carefully staged by CT and some lateral pericolonic hematomas. As with blunt trauma, retrohepatic hematomas without obvious active hemorrhage are not opened.\r"

Appendiceal tissue was obtained so as to exclude the lumen. A total of 223 anaerobes and 82 aerobic or faculatative bacteria were recovered, an average of 10.2 different organisms per specimen. Twenty-one different genera and more than 40 species were encountered. Bacteroides fragilis group and Escherichia coli were isolated from almost all specimens. Within the B. fragilis group, eight species were represented. Other frequent isolates included Peptostreptococcus (80%), Pseudomonas (40% [P. aeruginosa, 23.3%, other Pseudomonas spp., 16.7%]), B. splanchnicus (40%), B. intermedius (36.7%), and Lactobacillus (36.7%).

  ".W": "In 1984 we started a prospective controlled trial comparing endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES) with the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) in the elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients. The study population included 40 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension referred to our department from October 1984 to March 1988. These patients were drawn from a pool of 173 patients who underwent either elective surgery or endoscopic sclerotherapy during this time. Patients were assigned to one of the two groups according to a random-number table: 20 to DSRS and 20 to ES. During the postoperative period, no DSRS patient died, while one ES patient died of uncontrolled hemorrhage. One DSRS patient had mild recurrent variceal hemorrhage despite an angiographically patent DSRS. Four ES patients suffered at least one episode of gastrointestinal bleeding: two from varices and two from esophageal ulcerations. Five ES patients developed transitory dysphagia. Long-term follow-up was complete in all patients. Two-year survival rates for shunt (95%) and ES (90%) groups were similar. One DSRS patient rebled from duodenal ulcer, while three ES patients had recurrent bleeding from esophagogastric sources (two from varices and one from hypertensive gastropathy). One DSRS and two ES patients have evolved a mild chronic encephalopathy; four DSRS and two ES patients suffered at least one episode of acute encephalopathy. Two ES patients had esophageal stenoses, which were successfully dilated. Preliminary data from this trial seem to indicate that DSRS, in a subgroup of patients with good liver function and a correct portal-azygos disconnection, more effectively prevents variceal rebleeding than ES. However no significant difference in the survival of the two treatment groups was noted.\r"

  ".W": "Between October 1980 and December 1985, 471 patients with a resectable rectal carcinoma entered a randomized multicenter trial for comparison of pre- and postoperative irradiation. Two hundred thirty-six patients were allocated to receive high-dose fractionated preoperative irradiation (total dosage, 25.5 Gy in five to seven days) and 235 patients to receive postoperative irradiation to a very high dosage level with conventional fractionation (60 Gy in a total 8 weeks). The postoperative treatment was delivered only to a high-risk group of patients (Astler-Coller stages B2, C1, and C2). The preoperative irradiation was well tolerated, with no immediate irradiation-related complications and no increased postoperative mortality (3%, 7 of 217 patients, compared to 5%, 10 of 215 patients in the postoperatively irradiated group). More patients in the preoperative irradiation group had perineal wound sepsis after abdominoperineal resection and this prolonged the stay in hospital after surgery. In 50% of the patients the postoperative treatment could not be commenced until more than 6 weeks after surgery. The postoperative treatment was not as well tolerated as the preoperative one. The local recurrence rate was statistically significantly lower after preoperative than after postoperative radiotherapy (12% versus 21%; p = 0.02). In both groups more patients developed a local recurrence if the bowel was perforated at surgery or if the resection line was microscopically close to the tumor. To date, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years and a mean follow-up of 6 years, there is no difference in survival rates between the two groups.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombocytopenic purpura is a common hematologic abnormality occurring in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1. Of the nearly two million people infected with HIV-1, approximately 11% have platelet counts of less than 100,000/mm3. If no etiology other than HIV-1 infection can be found for the thrombocytopenia, the syndrome is referred to as HIV-1-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT). Steroids lead to an improvement in the platelet count in 60% to 80% of effected individuals but the majority of those who respond cannot maintain a normal platelet count when steroids are withdrawn. Furthermore concern over chronic steroid therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals has led to the investigation of other forms of treatment for this syndrome. This report describes the experience at Duke University Medical Center with eight patients who developed HAT and subsequently underwent splenectomy. In this group there was 1 complete response, 5 partial responses, and 2 patients who did not respond. There were no perioperative deaths and minimal perioperative morbidity. No evidence for the progression of HIV-1 infection in asymptomatic patients after splenectomy to AIDS related complex (ARC) or to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was seen. In addition no increase in the susceptibility to infections by encapsulated organisms as a result of splenectomy was observed after a mean follow-up of 13.25 months. A review of 79 other cases reported in the literature suggests a higher response rate than that observed in our patients. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed and an algorithm defining the role of splenectomy in the management of HAT is presented.\r"

It occurs frequently, but not exclusively, in patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes who also have evidence of diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Associated steatorrhea is common and does not necessarily imply a concomitant gastrointestinal disease. The diarrhea is often intermittent; it may alternate with periods of normal bowel movements, or with constipation. It is typically painless, and occurs during the day as well as at night and may be associated with fecal incontinence. Multiple pathogenic mechanisms have been implicated, autonomic neuropathy, bacterial overgrowth, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency being the most important underlying aberrations. However, diabetic diarrhea does not have a uniform and unequivocal pathogenesis. The diagnosis depends on a judicious clinical assessment accompanied by a stepwise laboratory evaluation, which allows the differentiation idiopathic diabetic diarrhea from the many other causes of diarrhea that can occur in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The management can be difficult but many therapies, including antibiotics to eradicate bacterial overgrowth, as well as antidiarrheal agents, oral and topical clonidine, and somatostatin analogues may be effective in controlling diabetic diarrhea.\r"

The role of prostaglandin inhibition by NSAIDs is discussed in the context of renal prostaglandin physiology. Potential differences among NSAIDs are reviewed. The \"renal sparing\" effect of sulindac may be attributable to the relative preservation of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Salsalate, although anti-inflammatory, demonstrates weak prostaglandin inhibition at therapeutic doses. A framework is developed for the clinical application of these considerations. Along a continuum of increasing risk factors for NSAID nephrotoxicity, or increasing NSAID dose, there likely exists a therapeutic window where differences among NSAIDs are most relevant.\r"

Focal glomerulosclerosis, characterized by segmental and/or global collapse of capillary walls, was observed in 15 of these patients; mesangial proliferation in 2, and membranous nephropathy in 1. Those with focal glomerulosclerosis typically demonstrated heavy proteinuria without edema or hypertension and progressed rapidly to renal failure in less than 1 year from the time of discovery. This form of focal glomerulosclerosis is characterized by a fulminant course, the collapse type of sclerosis, and the frequent occurrence of uremia without advanced glomerular obliteration. The absence of widespread glomerular sclerosis and the rapid course suggest that unique renal hemodynamic mechanisms may be responsible for the progression.\r"

Cholestyramine resin, 4 to 12 g twice daily, reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 15% and 21%, respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased 8% to 10% by all treatments. Plasma triglyceride levels were moderately decreased by simvastatin treatment, while triglyceride levels increased with cholestyramine treatment. Simvastatin was better tolerated than cholestyramine, which had numerous gastrointestinal tract side effects. No patient had a serious drug-related adverse event.\r"

Three clinical units randomized 303 selected volunteers into intervention (low-fat eating plan) or control (customary diet) groups. The two groups were comparable at baseline. The intervention group received nutrition instruction and behavioral counseling largely in permanent groups of 12 to 15 participants meeting weekly, then biweekly, and finally monthly. At 6 months, they had substantially reduced the mean proportion of total energy from fat from 39.1% to 20.9%, compared with the control group's nonsignificant reduction from 39.0% to 38.1%. At 12 and 24 months, they sustained the reduction of energy from fat. Weight loss and plasma cholesterol level changes in the intervention group supported the self-recorded dietary intake changes. Attendance at intervention sessions averaged 75% during the first 6 months and, subsequently, 60% to 70%. Four-day food records for the randomized women were obtained at 6 and 12 months from approximately 95% and at 24 months from 87%. A clinical trial of a low-fat diet is feasible in women.\r"

We report here the short-term treatment outcome of a 12-week comparison trial of bulimic outpatients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment cells: (1) imipramine hydrochloride treatment, (2) placebo treatment, (3) imipramine treatment combined with intensive group psychotherapy, and (4) placebo treatment combined with intensive group psychotherapy. All three active treatment cells resulted in significant reductions in target-eating behaviors and in a significant improvement in mood relative to placebo treatment. However, the results also suggested that the amount of improvement obtained with the intensive group psychotherapy component was superior to that obtained with antidepressant treatment alone. The addition of antidepressant treatment to the intensive group psychotherapy component did not significantly improve outcome over intensive group psychotherapy combined with placebo treatment in terms of eating behavior, but did result in more improvement in the symptoms of depression and anxiety.\r"

Clinically, schizophrenic patients report oversensitivity to sensory stimulation that theoretically correlates with stimulus overload and leads to cognitive fragmentation. Paradigms using cortical event-related potentials and the prepulse inhibition of startle responses show that schizophrenic patients also have impaired central nervous system inhibition (sensorimotor gating). Animal model studies demonstrate that increased systemic aminergic activity and increased nucleus accumbens dopamine tone causes sensorimotor gating failure, similar to that seen in schizophrenic patients. The time course of the observed schizophrenic and animal model deficits is compatible with the \"temporal map\" of monoaminergic neuron functions (le, several hundred milliseconds). Studies of sensorimotor gating allow investigators to comment on the spatial and temporal mapping of neurons, trait and state deficits, and vulnerability factors in the schizophrenic spectrum of disorders. By translating attentional theories into testable hypotheses, the neurobiology of schizophrenic disorders becomes clearer.\r"

To assess the sensitivity of various reagents used for performance of activated partial thromboplastin times and factor IX assays, a series of samples with varying levels of factor IX were included in the 1988 College of American Pathologists Survey Program. We found significant differences in the sensitivity of reagents to factor IX deficiency. Surprisingly, the least sensitive reagents were among the most commonly used reagents. Significant differences in the classification of activated partial thromboplastin times as abnormal were noted between H1 and H2 survey participants. As with factor VIII assays, significant differences in the dose-response curves for factor IX deficiency were noted between reagents, with more responsive reagents giving more precise results for factor IX assays. Comparison of factor IX assay performance in 1988 with 1980 performance indicates a substantial improvement in assay precision. However, a further improvement in assay performance could be expected if current recommendations were followed.\r"

Also, amplification of c-erb B-2 showed a significantly negative association with both progesterone and estrogen receptor presence. Progesterone receptor presence correlated significantly with survival.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining of HER-2/neu protein on frozen sections was used to detect the HER-2/neu protein, and the Feulgen DNA staining method was used to assess DNA amounts in the same tumor cells. Positive HER-2/neu overexpression was evaluated visually, and quantitation of the HER-2/neu protein was measured by image analysis. Twenty-two of the 45 cases were visually scored to be positive for the overexpression of the HER-2/neu protein, and these cases also contained above 10% HER-2/neu protein compared with a standard control cell line. All 22 of these cases had near-tetraploid DNA content. In contrast, cells, derived from the 23 cases that did not overexpress the HER-2/neu protein, contained DNA amounts that ranged from euploid (diploid) to varying degrees of aneuploid. The results of this study indicated that tumors that overexpress the HER-2/neu protein have tetraploid or near-tetraploid DNA content. This pattern could relate to the biological behavior of these tumors.\r"

The results were then compared with those of normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis. The positive staining rate of the pancreatic cancer with any of the four tumor markers was higher than that of the normal pancreas. However, all markers except absorbed CEA showed a higher positive staining rate for chronic pancreatitis than for pancreatic cancer. There was no stromal type in normal pancreatic or chronic pancreatitis tissues with any of the four tumor markers. Our findings, therefore, indicate that absorbed CEA is useful in differentiating pancreatic cancer from normal pancreatic tissues. It is not useful in distinguishing chronic pancreatitis, however, unless a specific staining pattern is observed.\r"

Uninucleated and binucleated periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells were present in the spinal cord but not in ventral roots within regions at very early stages of myelination. These cells stained with the lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin, which preferentially binds to beta-D-galactosyl residues as found in stored metabolites of globoid cell leukodystrophy. Ultrastructural examination of the spinal cord revealed typical tubular spicular cytoplasmic inclusions in cells corresponding to the periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells. The degree and distribution of myelin tubules and myelination glia was similar to that in weight- and size-matched control fetuses. These results indicate that the first appearance of inclusion-bearing cells is closely associated with the onset of myelination in the central nervous system, apparently earlier in the stage of myelination than occurs in the central nervous system of the mouse model. Characteristic tubular inclusions are also present in renal epithelium in animal models but have not been seen in the human kidney. We have since identified noncharacteristic crystalline inclusions in the kidney of this human fetus.\r"

Sixteen female subjects (mean age in years +/- SE = 21 +/- 1) were randomly assigned to either a training or a control group. Concentric and eccentric torques of the right knee extensors were assessed at 1.05rad.s-1 using a KinCom isokinetic dynamometer system. Each test consisted of a set of four maximal concentric and four maximal eccentric contractions of the knee extensors. The peak and average torques for each contraction were calculated using the computer software supplied by the KinCom manufacturer. On a separate day, after abstaining from heavy exercise for at least 12 hours, a single cross-sectional image of the thigh at midfemur was obtained using computer tomography (CT) scanning. From this image, cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris group was calculated using the computer software associated with the General Electric 9800 CT Scanning System. Training group subjects trained three days weekly for six weeks on a Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer, completing five sets of ten maximal effort knee extensions at an angular velocity of 1.05rad.s-1. Each set of exercise was separated by two minutes of self-selected recovery. Torque outputs were monitored daily to ensure that adequate recovery was provided between sets of exercise, and to document changes in strength as the program progressed. Significant (p less than .01) increases in peak and average concentric torque (11% and 12%, respectively), peak and average eccentric torque (18% and 21%, respectively), and muscle cross-sectional area (3.2%) were observed for training group subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Issues concerning personal attendant/home health care were ranked highly in all four areas and were especially dominant in the area of rehospitalization. The issue of coordinated health care management received high ratings as well, especially in the \"access\" area. Other prominent issues included the effects of insurance coverage and the training of primary care providers in disability-related primary care. There was a high degree of correlation between the rankings of physicians and nonphysicians, especially in the areas of hospitalization, aging, and access.

The application of new technical procedures and an aggressive approach to certain metastatic lesions offer chances for improving operative results, but the greatest contribution to curing cancer that can be made by surgeons at this time is the complete removal of the small localized primary tumor. By more active participation in \"early detection programs\" surgeons can increase their opportunities to treat cancer at this stage. The American College of Surgeons, in consultation with the National Cancer Institute, has conducted a detailed survey that analyzes the lack of surgical participation in clinical trials with a view toward developing a more active surgical interest in evaluating new methods of treatment for the solid tumors. One of the current efforts to improve the outcome of these recalcitrant cancers involves increasing the number of trained surgical scientists in the field of cancer.\r"

Observations in the 1950s went on to prove the causal relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Attempts to lower the cancer risk by product modification have shown some promise, but an absolute risk reduction can be attained only by abstinence from tobacco use. The role of dietary fat as a risk factor for breast cancer is highlighted as an example of the link between nutrition and cancer. Preventive strategies of dietary modification need to delineate the roles of specific types of dietary fats in mammary carcinogenesis. Low-fat diets in conjunction with chemotherapy and ovarian ablation may even be effective in preventing metastasis or recurrence of breast cancer after surgery in premenopausal patients. Health education in schools and health promotion efforts involving all segments of the community need to be pursued as primary preventive strategies for cancer control, along with efforts to ward product modification and research on chemoprevention of cancer.\r"

Excessive lymphatic leakage is occasionally encountered in the course of operations at the base of the mesentery or retroperitoneum. A source can usually be identified and the leak controlled at the time of laparotomy by suture or clip. In the region of presumed leakage the importance of these efforts is reinforced by the are patient in whom such leakage persists, creating problems in recognition and management postoperatively. The development of this complication in a patient undergoing total abdominal colectomy and left-sided hepatic lobectomy prompted a review of our experience and a literature review. We report four cases of postoperative chylous ascites seen over 5 years. The fluid accumulation followed operations on the abdominal aorta (two patients) and on the colon and liver (one patient) and after a mesocaval shunt procedure (one patient). Two patients responded to low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diets; one patient required peritoneovenous shunting; and one patient died of progressive nutritional deterioration. We review the recognition and management of chylous ascites based on our experience and that reported elsewhere.\r"

In this article, we report our initial testing and subsequent experience with this technique. In the first 16 months of operation, 207 patients were treated (113 had arteriovenous malformations, 78 had extra-axial skull base neoplasms, 9 had glial neoplasms, and 7 had metastatic tumors). The patients' lesions either were considered previously as \"inoperable\" or were residual lesions after attempted surgical resection, or the radiosurgery was performed after the patient declined surgical excision. Gamma radiosurgery was associated with no surgical mortality and no significant early morbidity, and the results were encouraging during the minimum follow-up period of 6 months. Compared with treatment by conventional intracranial surgery (craniotomy), both the average length of stay and hospital charges for radiosurgery were significantly lower. Our initial experience further suggests that stereotactic radiosurgery using the gamma knife is a therapeutically effective and economically sound alternative to microneurosurgical removal of selected intracranial tumors and vascular malformations.\r"

We have also suggested that investigators focus on enumerating which patients improve in a trial, rather than on the mean level of improvement in treated patients versus the control patients. Finally, we have suggested the reporting of confidence intervals rather than simply stating P values. With the inauguration of these changes and more attention to other issues relevant to the quality of clinical trials, we hope that drug treatments of rheumatoid arthritis can be more easily compared with respect to effectiveness.\r"

Administration of the daily FA supplement significantly lowered toxicity scores without affecting efficacy, as measured by joint counts, joint indices, and patient and physician evaluation of disease activity. Fifteen patients experienced some sort of toxicity; 67% were in the placebo group, and 33% were in the FA supplement group. Four patients in the placebo group had toxicity levels serious enough to require discontinuation of the MTX, while no patients in the FA supplement group discontinued MTX because of toxicity. Low-normal initial plasma and red blood cell folate levels were predictive of future toxicity with MTX therapy. We conclude that a daily supplement of 1 mg of FA during low-dose MTX therapy (median dose 7.5 mg/week [16.4 mumoles]) is usefull in lessening toxicity without altering efficacy during the first 6 months of treatment.\r"

Emergent intraoperative treatment consisted of false aneurysm resection, embolectomy, and placement of a prosthetic graft. Distal circulation was restored, but the neurological deficit persisted in the left arm and a fever developed in the patient, necessitating rehospitalization 3 weeks after discharge.

  ".W": "The number of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis is growing in the United States. To provide adequate emergent care to these patients emergency physicians must understand the alterations in normal physiologies present in these patients and how this may affect care. Cardiovascular disease and infection (especially Staphylococcus aureus sepsis) are the leading causes of death among dialysis patients. These patients are also subject to a significantly higher incidence of life-threatening electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia, than the general population. Suicide, cardiac tamponade, intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding disorders, and bowel infarction are also much more frequent. The inability of dialysis patients to excrete drugs, metabolites, toxins, and fluids significantly alters their responses to common emergencies and should directly influence their care. Failure to recognize these differences in physiology may result in the use of standard forms of emergency therapy that may compound, rather than treat, the underlying disorder. Although most dialysis patients who come into an emergency department have conditions that can, and should, be managed by their nephrologist, the presence of a life threatening emergency requires prompt, appropriate therapy by the emergency physician.\r"

In this report, the authors review the use of corticosteroids, fibronectin, naloxone hydrochloride, and immunotherapy, with emphasis on theoretical considerations and relevant clinical experience. Although these treatment methods may have been promising initially, data from large double-blind human trials are either lacking or unencouraging. While continued research and modern therapeutic approaches should improve future survival rates from septic shock, use of the therapies reviewed should be considered experimental at this time.\r"

Biological renin activities were measured by bioassay. The PIR levels in infants delivered vaginally were significantly lower than those in infants delivered by cesarean section, while the PRA levels were the opposite. However, the PTR levels were not significantly different between the two groups. These results suggest that the plasma levels of biological inactive renin in infants delivered vaginally may decrease, probably due to its conversion to active renin in the second stage of labor.\r"

At baseline (off medication), both groups were similar for age (46 +/- 8 years v 48 +/- 12 years), mean blood pressure (121 +/- 8 mm Hg v 115 +/- 8 mm Hg), left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular mass index (118 +/- 24 g/m2 v 113 +/- 13 g/m2), and left ventricular filling as reflected by transmitral flow velocity ratio A/E (0.97 +/- 0.33 v 0.92 +/- 0.19, normal age-matched control A/E ratio is 0.64 +/- 14). There were 6 blacks and 6 whites in the labetalol group; 6 blacks and 9 whites in the atenolol group. At six weeks of treatment, whites in the labetalol group showed a significantly greater drop in mean blood pressure (114 +/- 7/102 +/- 11, P less than .007 v 123 +/- 9/114 +/- 11, P = NS) and correspondingly greater improvement in A/E ratio (1.04 +/- 0.14/0.74 +/- 0.23, P less than .024 v 1.02 +/- 0.23/0.89 +/- 0.16, P = NS). However, this difference was no longer significant when controlling for age and blood pressure level. In the atenolol group, whites showed a significant increase in the rapid filling phase velocity E, while late filling phase velocity A significantly dropped only in blacks, without significant improvement in A/E ratio in either subgroup. In conclusion, greater improvement in left ventricular filling is seen with combined alpha-beta-blockade than beta-blockade alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Selective decrease of ANG II receptors in the SFO of the genetically hypertensive rats with enalapril may be related to its therapeutic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "The tubular-vascular connection via the juxtaglomerular apparatus appears to serve two functions, local control of renal vascular resistance and regulation of renin secretion. A fall in single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and an increase in resistance are produced by an increase in NaCl concentration at the macular densa. This change also results in inhibition of secretion of renin. The macula densa has a unique location near the terminal end of the thick ascending limb, where NaCl concentration is highly flow dependent. The cellular mechanisms by which changes in tubular fluid NaCl produce vasoconstriction and inhibition of renin secretion are unknown, but the anatomy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus strongly suggests that such responses may be mediated by the extraglomerular mesangial cells located in the polar cushion underlying the macula densa. Recent evidence suggests that interstitial chloride concentration in this compartment may be quite variable, and that increases in external chloride may enhance the activation of the mesangial cell.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two young (18-32 yr) and 22 healthy elderly (60-80 yr) patients received either halothane or isoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia during controlled ventilation. End-tidal fractional concentrations (FE) of the agents were measured for 20 min after their introduction into inspired gas and the increase in end-tidal concentrations of the two agents was compared during induction of anaesthesia using the ratios of FE to the inspired fraction (FI). FE:FI ratios for isoflurane were higher than those for halothane in both young and elderly patients, confirming that equilibration of end-tidal with inspired concentration occurs more rapidly with isoflurane than with halothane in both age groups. FE:FI ratios for isoflurane became significantly lower in the elderly than in the young after 15 min administration of isoflurane. This suggests slower induction of anaesthesia in the elderly if equipotent concentrations of isoflurane are used; the clinical significance of this difference is probably small. Mean FE:FI ratios for halothane in elderly patients were similar to those in the young throughout induction of anaesthesia.\r"

Flumazenil (group A: 0.47 (SD 0.12) mg i.v., group B: 0.48 (0.06) mg i.v.) was significantly more effective than placebo in antagonizing the sedative effects of midazolam, but was accompanied by rebound sedation after 90 min. Additional s.c. administration of flumazenil 0.1 mg (group B) did not eliminate resedation. Undesirable side effects include nausea and vomiting. Local tolerance of the subcutaneous administration of flumazenil was good.\r"

  ".W": "Ropivacaine 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0% was investigated in an open study of extradural anaesthesia in three groups of 15 patients undergoing urological or orthopaedic surgery. Following a test dose of 3 ml of 1.0% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline, ropivacaine 20 ml was given in incremental doses over 4 min via a lumbar extradural catheter. The onset time for analgesia was short in all groups: T12 was blocked 4-6 min after the end of the injection of ropivacaine. The maximum segmental level was significantly higher in the 0.75% and the 1.0% groups (T2) than in the 0.5% group (T5). Complete motor block was obtained in seven, four and nine patients in the 0.5%, 0.75% and the 1.0% groups, respectively. Duration of analgesia increased with increasing concentration of ropivacaine: mean duration of analgesia was 203 and 266 min at T10 and 253 and 314 min at L5 for the 0.5 and 1% solutions, respectively. Mean duration of complete motor block was 94 and 192 min for the same solutions. Analgesia was satisfactory for surgery in all patients except for one in the 0.75% group. Hypotension was experienced by three, seven and three patients in the 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0% groups, respectively. Bradycardia occurred in seven patients and was associated with hypotension in five. Backache was experienced after operation by four patients, and three patients complained of a brief mild headache. No late adverse events were seen.\r"

Expected values were based on linear regressions of femur length on biparietal diameter in 1340 control pregnancies from 27 ultrasound departments. The median value for the affected pregnancies was 0.94 times the expected value (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). Eleven per cent of affected and 1.4% of control pregnancies had values less than or equal to 0.85 times the expected. The reduction in femur length in affected pregnancies was not related to biparietal diameter or to maternal age. Fetal femur length may be useful as an ancillary screening variable in the antenatal screening for Down's syndrome.\r"

Each woman was scheduled to undergo three ultrasound screens (consisting of 1-12 scans) to detect regressing and non-regressing masses. A total of 14,594 screens (15,977 scans) was performed. The average interval between successive screens was 595 days (range 214-1134 days). Overall, 650 screens (4.4%; 10.1% of women) produced a positive result which became negative with successive scans (four times more frequently in pre- than naturally postmenopausal women), and 338 screens (2.3%; 5.9% of women) had a final positive result (at least one ovary that was grossly abnormal or contained a persistent mass). Biopsies were taken from 336 ovaries (89% of total, 271 women). Overall, 134 tumour-like conditions and 119 benign tumours were identified. The detection rate of tumour-like conditions was 1.5 times higher in premenopausal than naturally postmenopausal women, whereas the proportion of tumours to normal ovaries was similar in both groups. Overall, 51% of tumour-like conditions and 70% of all tumours were detected at screen 1. Four women had metastatic ovarian cancer (three at screen 1, one at screen 2; two were bilateral). Five women (0.1%) had a primary malignant tumour (two at screen 1, three at screen 2; four were stage 1a and one was stage 1b). All women are being monitored to obtain additional information about the significance of the findings.\r"

Women received either 1 microgram/min until delivery or the commonly recommended treatment of 1500 micrograms in 8 h followed by another, identical course of treatment if delivery did not occur within 24 h. The 1 microgram/min dose schedule used half the amount of prostaglandin and resulted in statistically significantly fewer gastrointestinal side-effects compared with the conventional treatment. All women were delivered vaginally and there were no differences in induction-to-delivery intervals between the two treatments. Sulprostone infused at a rate of 1 microgram/min resulted in a 50% chance of being delivered within 12 h and a 90% chance of being delivered within 24 h, with an overall frequency of side-effects of 20%.\r"

The 48 pregnancies with monochorionic placentas (in which vascular anastomoses are almost universal) were compared with the 15 monozygotic pregnancies having dichorionic placentas. The type of placenta found at delivery was predicted with substantial accuracy by ultrasound examination in mid-pregnancy. We were unable to identify any inter-group difference in fetal growth rate, discordance of fetal growth between twins or pattern of umbilical artery flow velocity waveform. In the absence of the rare florid twin transfusion syndrome, the vascular anastomoses that have been shown to be common in monochorionic placentas do not exert a strong influence on fetal growth or fetoplacental blood flow.\r"

Though several new regimens for prophylaxis and treatment of these syndromes have been introduced, the overall incidence has been only slightly reduced over the last few years. We retrospectively analyzed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) serum levels between day -8 and day 100 after bone marrow transplantation in 56 patients transplanted in our unit for a variety of hematological diseases. In 34 patients with uneventful courses, mean TNF alpha levels rose to a maximum of 76 +/- 29 pg/mL. In contrast, 22 patients with major transplant related complications showed mean increases of TNF alpha of 492 +/- 235 pg/mL (P less than .0001). Increases of TNF alpha occurred before interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute graft-versus-host disease with a latency of 25 to 54 days. Early complications such as endothelial leakage syndrome and veno-occlusive disease were closely associated with increases of TNF alpha serum levels. Our study suggests two pathways of TNF alpha release: activation of host macrophages and stimulation of donor cells in the course of acute graft-versus-host disease. Cytokine monitoring should be helpful for prediction and earlier treatment of major transplant related complications.\r"

  ".W": "In a multicenter pilot study, 32 patients showing steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were treated by in vivo administration of anti-interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor monoclonal antibody (MoAb B-B10). Twenty-three patients received marrow from HLA-matched related donors, four from matched unrelated donors and five from partially matched related donors. The overall grade of GVHD was II in 16 patients, III in two, and IV in five. Five milligrams of B-B10 MoAb was infused in bolus daily for 10 days and then every second day for a further 10 days in an attempt to reduce GVHD recurrence. No clinical side effects were noted during the B-B10 treatment period. A complete response (CR) acute GVHD was achieved in 21 patients (65.6%). Six patients (18.7%) showed partial improvement (PR) and 5 patients (15.6%) no response (NR). A significant factor associated with GVHD response was the delay between the onset of the GVHD and the first day of B-B10 infusion. The earlier B-B10 was introduced, the greater the probability of CR (P = .03). There was no correlation between the serum B-B10 level and GVHD response (P = .69). There was, however, a significant correlation between the clinical response and the B-B10 kinetics as a function of time: serum B-B10 levels attained a plateau level more rapidly in the CR group than in the PR/NR group. Among the 26 complete and partial evaluable responders, GVHD recurred in 10 cases (38.4%). Host anti-B-B10 MoAb immune response occurred in only one (7.1%) of the 14 patients analyzed. Fourteen of the 32 patients (43.7%) are currently alive between 2 and 14 months after GVHD treatment with B-B10 was completed.\r"

In three cases with loss of one Ha-ras gene, the remaining gene had no mutations in critical areas of exons 1 and 2.

  ".W": "Six hundred twelve eligible, previously untreated patients with active multiple myeloma and at least some data available for analysis were entered into a randomized trial (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] Phase III myeloma study 8229/30), in which the prognostic significance of pretreatment serum beta 2 microglobulin levels was evaluated. Because there was no statistically significant survival difference between the alternating and syncopating VMCP/VBAP regimens, it was possible to evaluate serum beta 2 microglobulin for the total population all together. The serum beta 2 microglobulin measurements showed the highest significance of any prognostic factor, both in the bivariate and multivariate regression analyses. The median survival was 36 months for the 322 patients with pretreatment serum beta 2 microglobulin values of less than 6 micrograms/mL, as compared with a median survival of 23 months for the 225 patients with a beta 2 level of greater than or equal to 6 mcg/mL (P less than .0001). The stepwise multiple regression model first contained serum beta 2 microglobulin, followed by serum albumin, serum calcium, age, and serum creatinine. Serum beta 2 microglobulin was highly correlated with stage: median values ranged from 3.7 micrograms/mL for stage IA, to 10.1 for stage IIIB. It was possible to stratify myeloma patients based on combinations of serum beta 2 microglobulin with both albumin and age, producing excellent separation of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories. It is concluded that serum beta 2 microglobulin is the most powerful prognostic factor currently available for multiple myeloma and that it can be used alone or in combination with other variables for pretreatment stratification.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (recombinant human M-CSF) given as a single intravenous injection to Lewis rats induces a dose-dependent peripheral monocytosis, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. The monocytosis peaks at 28 to 32 hours with a seven- to eightfold increase in the number of circulating monocytes and promonocytes. The peripheral monocytosis is accompanied by a slight increase in marrow blasts, promonocytes, and monocytes. A monocytopenia reaching a nadir at 15 minutes precedes the monocytosis, suggesting that M-CSF activates circulating monocytes and causes intravascular margination. The M-CSF-induced neutrophilia and lymphopenia are relatively mild in magnitude, are observed between 2 and 16 hours after injection, and are no longer evident at later time-points. The monocytosis was at least partially inhibited by dexamethasone. M-CSF-induced monocytosis most likely reflects a direct effect of M-CSF on marrow monocyte precursor proliferation, maturation, and release, whereas the neutrophilia and lymphopenia may reflect indirect effects mediated by the known ability of M-CSF to cause the release of other cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a regulatory glycoprotein that stimulates the production of neutrophilic granulocytes from committed hematopoietic progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we show that biosynthetic (recombinant) human G-CSF enhances colony formation by normal human bone marrow and the human myeloid leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1, as well as nonhematopoietic small cell lung cancer lines, H128 and H69. G-CSF also modulates multiple differentiated functions of human neutrophils, including enhanced oxidative metabolism in response to f-Met-Leu-Phe (f-MLP), increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and augmented arachidonic acid release in response to ionophore and chemotactic agents. These effects are all maximal at a concentration of 100 to 500 pmol/L. Using 125I-labeled recombinant human G-CSF, high affinity binding sites were identified on human neutrophils, the myeloid leukemia cell lines KG-1 and HL-60, and the small cell carcinoma cell lines, H128 and H69. G-CSF receptor numbers ranged between 138 and 285 sites per cell with a kd of 77 to 140 pmol/L, consistent with the concentrations of G-CSF that elicit biologic responses in vitro. Decreased specific binding of 125l-G-CSF by human neutrophils was consistently observed in the presence of excess unlabeled human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), suggesting competition or down modulation by GM-CSF of the G-CSF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To stimulate granulopoiesis, we gave recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 120 microgram/m2/d) to a patient with congenital neutropenia. The treatment resulted in marked increases in white blood cell counts (maximum, 17,400/microL), consisting mainly of eosinophils (maximum, 13,050/microL) and monocytes (maximum, 1305/microL), rather than neutrophils (maximum, 798/microL). Circulating phagocytes (97% eosinophils) derived after GM-CSF treatment were less effective in chemotaxis, slower but equally effective in phagocytosis, and more effective in H2O2 production compared with normal control neutrophils, but comparable in chemotaxis and H2O2 production to control eosinophils. Before GM-CSF treatment, the bone marrow showed a maturation defect in the neutrophilic series that persisted after treatment despite marked increases in mature cells of other lineages. In vitro agar culture of bone marrow cells before GM-CSF treatment showed a normal number of granulocyte colonies; however, maturation was limited to the metamyelocyte stage. Although the absolute number and cycling rates of myeloid colony forming cells (predominantly eosinophils) increased after treatment, the maturation defect in the neutrophilic series persisted. The finding that GM-CSF induced stimulation of proliferation, which was coupled with maturation in the eosinophilic and monocytic but not the neutrophilic components, suggests that this patient had an intrinsic cellular or humoral defect in neutrophil maturation.\r"

No preferential IgG3 expression was observed in 11 IgG-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The marked predominance of IgG3 in HCL suggests a deviation in heavy chain class switching that may be related to the characteristically very low expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 molecules on hairy cells, and hence a defect in T-cell hairy cell interaction.\r"

Two subclones from the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line were unable to digest bacterial DNA unless they were previously induced to mature by incubation for several days with 1.25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The maximal capacity of DMSO-induced HL-60 cells to digest DNA was similar to that of monocytes purified from peripheral blood (PB) and much greater than that of neutrophils. The increasing capacity to digest DNA during maturation was associated with the development of acid DNAse activity, measured in a cell-free system, and slightly preceded development of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated respiratory burst activity. The acid DNAse had a pH optimum of 5.0 and did not require the presence of calcium or 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). A third subclone of HL-60 cells was able to digest DNA from intact bacteria without previous maturation, however, and this was associated with the presence of an alkaline DNAse which had a pH optimum between 7.0 and 8.0 and showed a dependence on calcium and 2-ME for maximal activity. The subcellular location of acid DNAse in DMSO-induced HL-60 cells was similar to that of monocytes in having a bimodal distribution on fractionated sucrose density gradients. The dense peak (mean density 1.195 g/mL) was located in the same region of the gradient as primary granule enzymes but the light peak (mean density 1.137 g/mL) did not codistribute with either plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondria, suggesting accumulation in a different organelle.\r"

  ".U": "90149170\r", 
  ".W": "Escherichia coli were labeled with 59Fe and then either treated with myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and chloride or opsonized and mixed with human neutrophils. The myeloperoxidase system at pH 7.4 caused release of most of the bacterial 59Fe. A similar result has been obtained by Rosen and Klebanoff (J Biol Chem 257:13731, 1982) but at pH 5. Iron release at pH 7.4 did not require the presence of a chelator, and the majority passed through a 10,000 relative molecular mass cut-off ultrafiltration membrane. When iron-poor lactoferrin was present during incubation with myeloperoxidase, 88% of the released 59Fe was precipitated with anti-lactoferrin antiserum, indicating that it was lactoferrin-bound. When the bacteria were mixed with neutrophils in a 10:1 ratio, approximately 50% were phagocytosed. About 40% of the 59Fe was released from the ingested bacteria over a 40-minute period. Initially, most remained associated with the neutrophil phagosomes, but with time, there was gradual transfer of some of the iron to the medium. Using anti-lactoferrin antiserum, 50% to 60% of phagosomal iron and 64% to 71% of iron in the medium was shown to be bound to lactoferrin. Thus, iron is released from phagocytosed E coli. Most becomes bound to lactoferrin, and some of this is released into the surroundings of the neutrophils. This suggests that neutrophil lactoferrin may function to trap iron from ingested microorganisms, enabling its removal from sites of inflammation. This may prevent iron from catalyzing undesirable oxidative reactions, as well as making it unavailable for growth of microorganisms that survive the killing process.\r"

The present study was designed to answer some of these questions. Experiments in which rats were injected intraperitoneally and intravenously with bile, Escherichia coli or saline showed that bile had no systemic toxicity and that it increased the mortality rate only when introduced into the peritoneal cavity together with bacteria. Measurements of peritoneal fluid volumes and blood pressure did not confirm the theory that the increased mortality rate was a consequence of loss of plasma volume into the peritoneal cavity. The number of intraperitoneal bacteria decreased continuously in animals receiving intraperitoneal E. coli alone. When bile was added by intraperitoneal injection, the number of intraperitoneal bacteria started to rise at 2 h and then increased steadily with a consequent bacteraemia at 10 h. The number of bacteria per peritoneal phagocyte was significantly lower after intraperitoneal injection of E. coli and bile, when compared with injection of E. coli alone. It is concluded that bile exerts its detrimental effect within the peritoneal cavity in the presence of bacteria. Bile impairs local host defence in a way that remains unknown and may be related to the detergent-lytic effects of bile salts.\r"

Nine patients in group 1 suffered postoperative symptoms of gastric stasis compared with only one patient in group 2 (P = 0.0106). Three patients in group 1 died from aspiration pneumonia before discharge from hospital. A gastric emptying test was performed on 24 patients between 1 and 3 months after surgery. By this time, most survivors had recovered from symptoms attributed to gastric stasis and no significant difference in gastric emptying could be demonstrated between the two groups. Selection of patients, a wide range of emptying times and improvement in gastric emptying on follow-up may explain the lack of correlation between postoperative symptomatology and the gastric half-emptying times. A pyloroplasty is advised to prevent the potentially lethal effects of gastric stasis in the early postoperative period following retrosternal reconstruction of the oesophagus.\r"

With proper analysis and control, DCIS of limited extent can be treated by local excision with or without radiation. Invasive breast cancer of limited extent can frequently be managed by lumpectomy and radiation therapy with survival rates equivalent to the more traditional mastectomy. Patient desires regarding breast preservation and quality of life are paramount. Risk: benefit analyses for individual patients need to be emphasized in issues of breast preservation and in selecting adjuvant therapy, both regional (radiotherapy) and systemic (chemotherapy) and hormonal therapy). We are entering an era of highly selective therapy based on more sophisticated analysis of the primary cancer. In the future, not only statistical predictions of outcome as achieved by flow cytometry, for example, will be more widely used, but individual prognostic factors may be developed such as with oncogene expression. Such individual prognostic factors will enable more selective therapy.\r"

Results obtained in the past only in the categorical cancer centers are currently being achieved more broadly. This reflects the work of formally trained gynecologic oncologists often in collaboration with formally trained radiation therapists distributing themselves in a horizontal fashion to more and more university medical centers, teaching hospitals, and quality tertiary hospitals in the private sector. The formalization of training in gynecologic oncology has been pivotal in this development. This group of physicians, working with physicians in other disciplines, have impacted significantly on patient care and have provided many clinical and pathologic studies to better define favorable low stage cases and poor prognosis cases. The need to explore the use of currently available modalities in a variety of different combinations and to define and develop new techniques to apply to these poor prognosis subsets of disease represent areas of progress and challenge.\r"

  ".U": "90149988\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past 10 years there has been significant progress made in the recognition and treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. With the advent of CAT scans and MRI, preoperative delineation of soft tissue tumors has become readily available. The diagnostic use of these modalities in patients presenting with an ill-defined asymptomatic mass has been extremely helpful in terms of screening patients to decide whether or not a biopsy is indicated. These techniques have also provided a much clearer delineation of the anatomic extent of the primary tumor, which has been of great assistance both in radiation therapy treatment calculations as well as in preoperative surgical planning. The recognition that tumor grade is the dominant prognostic variable has resulted in the more common use of a grading system, and a more uniform reporting and stratification of end results. Recent studies with immunohistochemical staining have proven of value in determining the histogenesis of many tumors that in the past were difficult to classify accurately. Most recently the use of flow cytometry suggests that this will also be a valuable adjunct in determining tumor grade and thereby prognosis. The most recent investigations of molecular biologic evaluation of genetic DNA and RNA sequences, as well as of oncogenes are extremely interesting from a diagnostic standpoint and in demonstrating the potential of molecular biologic evaluation for understanding the origin of these tumors. Multimodality therapy with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or all three has resulted in a marked improvement in local tumor control for patients with soft tissue sarcomas. The combination of modalities has allowed smaller surgical excisions of the tumor and thereby preservation of the extremity and much of its function. There are currently several different methods of multimodality therapy used including neoadjuvant therapy and postoperative therapy, both of which have been proven efficacious. Chemotherapy is now playing an increased role in clinical investigation and treatment. The availability of Adriamycin, DTIC, cisplatin, and most recently ifosfamide has added several chemotherapeutic agents for use by the clinician. Combination chemotherapy and radiation is of value in the neoadjuvant setting, and several studies are now underway to determine whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is of similar value in reducing systemic spread of disease. Finally, surgical resection of pulmonary metastases has been proven of value in 20% to 25% of patients who subsequently develop metastatic disease. As a result of these advances in several different treatment disciplines, the overall survival rate and quality of life of patients with soft tissue sarcoma have improved markedly over the past 10 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Prostatic-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy are major innovations in diagnosis and staging of prostatic cancer. The varied and unpredictable behavior of prostatic cancer has stimulated the search for reliable indicators of the biologic potential of the disease. Management of localized prostatic cancer remains controversial. A nerve-sparing technique of radical retropubic prostatectomy accomplishes total removal of the prostate with possible preservation of sexual potency. Linear accelerator irradiation is an acceptable alternative treatment. Interstitial irradiation with a variety of radionuclides remains under investigation using ultrasound to enhance distribution of radiation sources. Endocrine therapy may prove especially advantageous if administered before development of bone metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "In the present decade important progress has been made in the understanding of the biology and management of bladder cancer. Experimental laboratory models and new investigative tools have revealed potentially important prognostic markers and have led to an improved understanding of the histogenesis of the disease. Advances in the management of superficial bladder cancer (intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy, improved urinary cytology, laser technology, flexible fiberoptic cystoscopy, and photodynamic therapy) have, in some subgroups, improved tumor control while decreasing patient complications. For invasive bladder cancer (invasive of bladder muscle or beyond) improved techniques of cystectomy and radiotherapy have reduced the complications of treatment and may have contributed small but important improvements in cure. A major improvement in the last decade has occurred in objective remission rates with chemotherapy for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. From 20% to 40% of patients achieve a complete remission, and 10% to 20% may survive for more than 3 years. Randomized Phase III trials are currently in progress and must be completed to define the true role of multidrug chemotherapy in patients with metastatic disease and to validate data from the regimens of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and vincristine (CMV) and methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) before any of these approaches to treatment can be considered of proven benefit. Preliminary data from the Massachusetts General Hospital are presented of a potentially effective approach to select patients with invasive tumor for successful bladder preservation. In this approach transurethral debulking surgery is combined with upfront CMV chemotherapy plus cisplatin and 4000 cGy. If tumor is found on cystoscopic reevaluation with biopsy and cytology immediately following cisplatin and 4000 cGy, cystectomy is performed; if not, consolidation by a radiation boost to 6480 cGy plus cisplatin is given. The approach is fairly well tolerated, allows cystectomy without undue complications, has yielded a 88% complete response rate in patients selected for bladder preservation, and resulted in 90% of patients free of distant metastases with follow-up ranging from 6 to 30 months. A randomized Phase III trial with and without neoadjuvant MCV chemotherapy for selective bladder preservation is now under way and accruing well.\r"

Nonetheless, more children continue to die of ALL than of any other childhood cancer. This review outlines central issues in the staging and treatment of ALL that should be addressed if the cure rate in childhood ALL is to be significantly improved. Present dilemmas in the staging of ALL include the following: lack of standardization of staging systems; complicated algorithms; variable application and interpretation of multivariate analyses; dynamic interactions between prognostic front end variables and subsequent treatment; ambiguity of prognostic factors that are predictive of outcome but biologically inexplicable; unsuccessful attempts to define a good-prognosis subgroup for the purpose of streamlining therapy to a minimum; and the interface between ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloid leukemias. The remaining therapeutic problems include a lack of reliable in vitro tests of chemosensitivity and chemoresistance, inability to quantitate residual leukemia after remission induction or to detect drug-resistant clones of cells before they are clinically manifest, and delivery of optimum therapy and supportive care to all children with ALL.\r"

For those patients with soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumors, and bone tumors the combination of preoperative chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy followed by maintenance multiagent chemotherapy has resulted in a survival rate of 45% to 70%. In the case of neuroblastoma, a similar aggressive approach has not resulted in an improved survival. A different approach that uses screening of infants by urinary testing for VMA and HVA to detect earlier and potentially less malignant tumors has begun in Japan and North America in the hope that preclinical detection will reduce mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Successful treatment of germ cell tumors arising in the testes or extragonadal sites has become routine. The therapeutic approaches available for patients with germ cell tumor are determined by stage, histology, and site of tumor origin. Staging systems have played an important role in the development of therapy for patients with germ cell tumors. Staging systems must address not only the prognostic variables that determine survival but also the correct therapeutic approach available for such patients (surgery, chemotherapy, surgery plus chemotherapy). Trials are under way in many centers with the intention of reducing the intensity of therapy for patients with a good prognosis and increasing the intensity for those with a poor prognosis. The ability to compare data and, more importantly, to select safely and appropriately those patients to be placed at risk by reduced or increased intensity of therapy will require clinically relevant staging systems. Histologic type and the site of tumor origin markedly determine the clinical dilemmas existing for each group of patients. The subgroup with pure seminoma has tumors with a unique spectrum of sensitivity and toxicity to chemotherapy. A staging system for such patients must be necessity be designed specifically to meet their needs. Patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors have benefitted most from the introduction of chemotherapy. Tumor volume, histologic types, and site of origin greatly influence the results of treatment. Staging systems must be developed that meticulously evaluate tumor volume, secretion of serum biomarkers, and site of origin of tumor. The results of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center experience treating germ cell tumors support the use of such clinically relevant staging systems. The therapeutic dilemmas outlined for each of the histologic subtypes will serve as the basis of future studies.\r"

The induction of second cancers is a particularly important late side effect of cancer treatment. Several epidemiologic studies demonstrated increased risks of leukemia and solid tumors in patients exposed to radiotherapy. Large increases in leukemia risk have also been observed after chemotherapy with alkylating agents. However, several research questions remain unanswered, including the duration of the excess cancer risk after treatment, and the independent effect of various drugs on second cancer risk.\r"

Both primary and recurrent malignant gliomas are treated with stereotaxic implantation; primary malignant gliomas are treated in addition with nonstereotaxic external beam radiotherapy and concomitant and sequential chemotherapy. Median survival times measured from the time of implantation are as follows: primary glioblastoma multiforme, 95 weeks; recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, 54 weeks; primary anaplastic astrocytoma, 223 weeks; and recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, 81 weeks. Stereotaxic interstitial brachytherapy in conjunction with hyperthermia (thermoradiotherapy) is being studied in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic intracranial malignancy. External beam radiotherapy delivered stereotaxically in a single fraction (radiosurgery) has been used mainly for benign intracranial processes, although several centers are now exploring its use in the management of highly selected malignant lesions.

These include stimulation of immune effector cell proliferation, augmentation of cytotoxicity of immune effector cells for tumor cell targets, enhancement in antigen-recognition potential by monocytes, and modulation of tumor-associated antigen expression on neoplastic cells. Interferons (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), purified to homogeneity, can induce regression of metastatic malignancy. Recombinant DNA technology has facilitated large-scale production of these and other lymphokines and cytokines. It has also made possible analyses of physical structures of the molecules themselves and has enabled creation of mutated molecules with specific, desired substitutions in their amino acid sequence. Monoclonal antibodies, directed at tumor-associated antigens, can augment antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and can selectively deliver cytotoxic techniques to malignant cells. Molecules that modify the host resistance to malignant disease also have potential to augment effectiveness of other cancer treatment techniques. Lymphokines, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies, all products of biotechnology, have resulted in fulfillment of the promise of the immune system for inhibition of growth of human malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Although many effective anti-cancer agents are now available, their curative potential is compromised by a variety of problems related to tumor sensitivity, drug access, and pharmacokinetics. Central to the problem of inadequate chemotherapy is drug resistance. Drug resistance may be intrinsic, acquired, or induced, and it may develop to one drug or it may occur simultaneously to multiple agents (pleiotropic). Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance and techniques for overcoming that resistance. New evidence has emerged that highlights the importance of dose intensity in achieving successful drug treatment outcomes. Retrospective analysis of studies in breast, ovarian, colon cancer, and lymphoma suggest that new studies designed to optimize dose intensity may yield improved results. Several prospective trials have now corroborated the retrospectively derived importance of dose intensity as an independent factor in achieving improved survival. Finally, new techniques for drug delivery offer considerable promise. Chemotherapy by regional infusion and perfusion, implantable drug delivery systems, and continuous infusion of chemotherapy are unique novel techniques that may improve the efficacy of presently available chemotherapeutic agents even as new agents are developed.\r"

Currently, seven of these factors are in clinical trial: erythropoietin for treatment of anephric anemia, IL-2 in conjunction with LAC therapy, and IL-1, IL-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF for stimulation of myelopoiesis and granulocyte-macrophage function after chemotherapy, irradiation, or bone marrow transplantation in patients with cancer. G-CSF and GM-CSF have also proved effective in treatment of congenital and idiopathic neutropenias and have had some efficacy in treatment of myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic disorders, aplastic anemia, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

DNA ploidy patterns were determined by flow cytometric analysis. The Ki-67 labeling rates are rated from 4.6% to 82% (mean, 22%). A significant correlation was found between Ki-67 labeling rates and BrdU labeling indices. Sixty-seven percent of tumors with lymph node metastases showed Ki-67 labeling rates of less than 22%, whereas 33% of tumors without lymph node metastases showed Ki-67 labeling rates of less than 22%. There was a significant correlation between these two groups. Tumors with vessel invasion more often have higher Ki-67 labeling rates than those without vessel invasion. By the DNA ploidy classification, the mean Ki-67 labeling rates of aneuploid tumors was significantly higher than that of diploid tumors. This method yielded similar results to those obtained by BrdU labeling and flow cytometric study. The measurement of Ki-67 labeling rates may be useful to decide the therapeutic modalities.\r"

In routine histologic examination CIS may be overlooked, particularly in prepubertal individuals. The detection of this early malignancy may be greatly facilitated by use of immunohistochemical staining. The authors investigated the sensitivity of an immunohistochemical staining procedure with monoclonal antibody 43-9F in detection of CIS. Testicular specimens from 19 adult and two prepubertal individuals with CIS were tested. Positive staining reaction on the surface of malignant germ cells was encountered in all 21 specimens with CIS. The epithelial cells of the excretory ducts between testis and epididymis, including rete testis and canaliculi efferentes, reacted also positively with 43-9F. No staining was observed in nonmalignant testicular cells including Sertoli cells or Leydig cells in any of these samples or in testicular biopsy specimens from 27 adult and 11 prepubertal subjects without evidence of testicular neoplasia. Monoclonal antibody 43-9F was also found to react with cells of all four tested invasive testicular germ cell tumors. Thus, the monoclonal antibody 43-9F is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker of CIS germ cells and may also be of potential value in detection of invasive testicular cancer.\r"

A woman had AMoL when her third infant was born. This infant, who was a boy, also suffered from AMoL when he was 20 months of age. The infant's leukemic cells had the same cytochemical and immunophenotypic patterns as the mother's leukemic cells. By cytogenetic analysis, the majority of the infant's leukemic marrow cells had the 46,XX karyotype and showed no Y body by quinacrine staining. Moreover, the phenotype for human major histocompatibility system, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR of the infant's leukemic cells was consistent with that of the mother's lymphocytes. Thus, the infant's leukemic clone was found to be identical to the mother's leukemic clone. His lymphocytes could not react with the mother's leukemic cells or his own leukemic cells in mixed lymphocyte culture, suggesting that the HLA homozygosity of the mother may have played a role in inducing immunologic tolerance to the immigrated leukemic cells in the infant. This is the first report of an infantile leukemia transmitted from a mother with leukemia, supposedly through the placenta.\r"

The proportion of Ki-67-positive cells (Ki-67 score) in breast carcinomas varied from 0.6% to 80% (median, 6.3%). Ki-67 scores were significantly higher in the DNA aneuploid than in the DNA diploid tumors. Ki-67 scores correlated significantly with tumor SPF in DNA aneuploid tumors. In DNA diploid tumors SPF showed no correlation with Ki-67 score. High Ki-67 scores were associated with high mitotic counts (P less than 0.0001) and histologic grade (P less than 0.0001). Nuclear pleomorphism, tubule formation, or lymph node status were not correlated with Ki-67 score. In conclusion, Ki-67 immunostaining correlates with other measures of cell proliferation (SPF, mitotic count) supporting its clinical significance.\r"

Either abnormal ploidy or elevated proliferative activity predict a worsened disease-free or overall survival in most common adult malignancies. Both abnormalities are associated with poor outcome in locoregional breast, non-small cell lung, and colorectal cancers, and in all stages of ovarian cancer. Abnormal ploidy is also a dire prognostic indicator for cancers arising from the kidney, bladder, prostate, and endometrium. Clinical management of patients with these diseases may be aided by studying their tumors for these objective markers of biological aggressiveness.\r"

Meniscectomy is not the innocuous procedure it was once considered. Consequently, emphasis is now being placed on ways of repairing injured menisci in situ. To attain this goal, it is important to investigate the biology of the cells that synthesize and maintain the tissue that is to be repaired. In vitro culture techniques have aided in the understanding of how the cells of the meniscus (fibrochondrocytes) function and what is required to stimulate them to carry out the biologic functions they were designed to perform. In vitro culture of meniscal tissues may become an experimental tool for elucidating the requirements for meniscal repair and restoration of normal joint function after meniscal injury.\r"

This feat is currently beyond the capabilities of artificial materials alone. Alternatively, collagen-based prostheses acting as resorbable regeneration templates offer the possibility of inducing regrowth of new menisci. This paper presents a summary of hypotheses, considerations, and laboratory evidence for the use of collagen-based, resorbable matrices as regeneration templates.\r"

  ".W": "The menisci serve several important biomechanical functions in the knee. They distribute stresses over a broad area of articular cartilage, absorb shocks during dynamic loading, and probably assist in joint lubrication. These functions enhance the ability of articular cartilage to provide a smooth, near-frictionless articulation and to distribute loads evenly to the underlying bone of the femur and tibia. In addition, the menisci provide stability to the injured knee when the cruciate ligaments or other primary stabilizers are deficient. The ability to perform these mechanical functions is based on the intrinsic material properties of the menisci as well as their gross anatomic structure and attachments. The material properties of the menisci are determined by their biochemical composition and, perhaps more important, by the organization and interactions of the major tissue constituents: water, proteoglycan, and collagen. Interactions among the important constituents of the fibrocartilage matrix cause meniscal tissue to behave as a fiber-reinforced, porous, permeable composite material similar to articular cartilage, in which frictional drag caused by fluid flow governs its response to dynamic loading. The menisci are one-half as stiff in compression and dissipate more energy under dynamic loading than articular cartilage. Energy dissipation, or shock absorption, by the menisci is the result of high frictional drag caused by low permeability of the matrix, which is about one-sixth as permeable as articular cartilage. The dynamic shear modulus of meniscal tissue is only one-fourth to one-sixth as great as that of articular cartilage. The coarse, circumferential Type I collagen fiber bundles of the meniscus give the tissue great tensile stiffness (range, 100-300 megapascals) and strength. The highly oriented collagen ultrastructure of the menisci makes the tissue anisotropic in tension, compression, and shear and appears to dominate its behavior under all loading conditions.\r"

Stromal stem cells are capable of producing reticular, fibroblastic, osteogenic, and adipose stromal lines. Marrow-derived osteogenic cells are a component of marrow stroma, which in vitro form fibroblastic-type colonies. These colonies are a heterogeneous population with varying enzymatic expressions and potencies that differentiate into fibroblastic, reticular, adipocytic, and osteogenic populations. It is postulated that these colonies are a component of the stem- and progenitor cell populations. Progenitors of osteogenic cells are widely distributed in the extraskeletal organs. On contact with an adequate inductor, they differentiate into chondro- and/or osteoblasts, thus producing ectopic (i.e., induced) cartilage and/or bone. Such osteoprogenitor cells were termed inducible osteoprogenitor cells, in contrast to the determined osteoprogenitor cells, which are present in the bone marrow stroma and produce bone spontaneously. To the class of determined osteoprogenitors also belong endosteal cells, periosteal cells, and osteoblastic established cell lines. There is no evidence of the presence of osteogenic cells in the blood and peritoneal fluid. The concept of mesenchymal cells as an osteoblastic precursor in adult organisms is open to question.\r"

These include congenital anomalies, traumatic conditions, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, degenerative conditions, and neoplasms. In clinical practice, traumatic conditions, as exemplified by meniscal tears of the vertical-longitudinal or vertical-transverse type, are the most important pathologic disorders. Healing of meniscal tears occurs only when the tear involves the peripheral vascularized attachment of either the lateral or medial meniscus. Intensive clinical and animal experimentation suggests that serum-derived growth factors are necessary for meniscal healing. Chondrocalcinosis is extremely frequent in the menisci of older individuals and may or may not be associated with degenerative changes of the menisci, including fibrillation, loss of protein polysaccharide ground substance, and chondrocytic proliferation. The role of degenerative changes of the menisci, including tears of the horizontal type, in the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a subject of intense interest, as is the relationship between chondrocalcinosis and OA. Neoplastic involvement of the menisci is essentially limited to invasion by tumors starting in or, more commonly, adjacent to the knee joints.\r"

  ".W": "Hitherto, the meniscus has been regarded as a developmental remnant. However, when removed in part or in total, it alters the normal biomechanical, biochemical, and physiologic processes of the knee joint. Although the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is unknown, accelerated rates of normal metabolism may result in failure of the articular cartilage to maintain its mechanical integrity as a result of meniscectomy. In addition, an inflammatory state within the joint cavity may result in degenerative changes, due to a perturbation of the homeostatic anabolic and catabolic processes maintaining the knee joint. Animal models reliably reproduce the focal and relatively slow degeneration seen in humans. OA degeneration after meniscectomy has been described histologically with fibrillation, swelling, fissures, cell proliferation, clustering, cell nesting, and even necrosis. Biochemical changes, however, include proteoglycan loss, proteoglycan disaggregation, and an increase in proteoglycan synthesis. In addition to increased hydration, the main structural fibers of articular cartilage, composed of Type II collagen, are exposed to increased biomechanical forces. The minor collagens, e.g., Type IX collagen, may play a role in stabilizing the proteoglycan-Type II interaction, thus providing mechanical integrity. It appears that meniscectomy produces much more than wear-and-tear arthritis.\r"

Partial meniscectomy, meniscus repair, and leaving certain tears alone have become alternatives to routine total meniscectomy. Once a meniscus tear is definitively diagnosed, the physician's first decision involves whether to treat the tear surgically or leave it alone. If surgical treatment is judged to be appropriate, the next decision concerns whether it should be repaired or partially excised. Total meniscectomy is reserved for tears for which any other option is unsuitable. The pertinent factors that should be considered in this decision-making process are: (1) the clinical evaluation, (2) associated lesions, and (3) the exact type, location, and extent of meniscus tear.\r"

  ".W": "In this series of 153 meniscus tears, 8% were isolated whereas 92% were in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Exogenous fibrin clot was injected with a blunt needle in the seam of the tear. One to 2 ml of clot was sufficient to fill an average defect. When gaps could not be closed, such as with a radial split or flap in the posterior one-third of the meniscus, a fascia sheath was used to cover these defects and the exogenous clot was injected under the cover of the sheath. ACL-deficient knees were stabilized with an intraarticular reconstruction. Overall results were 64% healed, 24% incompletely healed, and 12% failed (less than 50% of vertical height of tear healed). In ACL-associated knees, the failure rate was 1.5% for tears in which surgery occurred up to two months after the time of injury. The failure rate for tears surgically treated two months to several years after injury was 20%. Complex tears had an even higher failure rate of 22%. It is these tears that will be treated with the fascia sheath. The isolated tear failure rate was 41% without the exogenous fibrin clot versus 8% with the exogenous clot. Complications included retear and popliteal neurovascular injury. Repair of almost all menisci in young active athletes is possible using the transarticular arthroscopic technique with a posterior incision. Repairs of tears of less than two months' duration from the time of injury to surgery result in significantly higher healing rates than those of more chronic tears. Isolated repairs heal significantly better with exogenous fibrin clot injection.\r"

The extracellular matrix of the meniscus is composed mainly of collagen, with smaller quantities of proteoglycans, matrix glycoproteins, and elastin. The collagen is predominantly Type I, with smaller quantities of Types II, III, and V. The proteoglycans are mainly large, aggregating proteoglycans with chondroitin sulfate as their dominant glycosaminoglycan. A small proportion of small dermatan sulfate proteoglycans is probably present. The matrix glycoproteins include the link proteins, the 116-k protein, and a group of adhesive or potentially adhesive proteins that includes Type VI collagen (here classified as a glycoprotein with a collagenous domain), fibronectin, and thrombospondin. The fibrochondrocytes of the meniscus appear to have considerable potential to respond to growth and other modulating factors in the repair or regeneration of the tissue.\r"

Fifty-seven patient knees were evaluated by a single experienced MRI interpreter; the findings were compared with arthroscopic findings by a single experienced knee arthroscopist. The overall sensitivity and specificity rates of MRI for tears in virgin menisci compared to arthroscopy were both 92%. These results support reports in the literature that MRI is an accurate noninvasive technique for evaluating meniscal tears. Seven patients were treated with arthroscopic meniscal repair and were evaluated by MRI before and after surgery. Despite an asymptomatic postoperative status in six patients, abnormal intrameniscal signal persisted in four. An unstable meniscal fragment was visualized in the patient with postoperative pain. MRI is also useful in evaluating meniscal degeneration, meniscal ossicles, parameniscal cysts, and abnormal meniscal morphology. MRI is the noninvasive diagnostic technique of choice in evaluating a spectrum of knee meniscal diseases.\r"

Early experimental work confirmed that meniscal defects that communicated with the peripheral vascular network would heal if repaired. However, those tears that did not communicate with the vascular bed would not heal even if repaired. Unfortunately, there has been no clinically applicable technique for evaluating blood flow in the torn meniscus. Experimental procedures using laser Doppler flowmetry have shown this to be a precise and simple tool for the evaluation of meniscal blood flow. Applications of this technique in the clinical situation show great promise in enabling the surgeon to make a decision to repair or remove the torn meniscus based on the blood flow in the remaining vascular bed.\r"

The authors describe a 4-day-old female infant who presented with profuse rectal bleeding resulting in a hematocrit fall from 38% to 30% within 8 hr after hospital admission. Sigmoidoscopy revealed colonic mucosa that was red, edematous, and friable, with punctate hemorrhages. Rectal biopsy showed marked eosinophilic infiltration with multifocal hemorrhage. Further history indicated that while the infant had been exclusively breast-fed since birth, the nursing mother had been drinking 4-5 glasses of cow's milk per day since delivery. Prick puncture skin testing of the infant was positive for cow's milk protein. A serum radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for cow's milk protein was positive. The infant's serum IgE was 1.5 IU/ml. Rectal bleeding resolved when the patient was given a casein hydrolysate formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson Nutrition, Evansville, IN), and endoscopy one week later showed improvement, with only scattered areas of erythema, and no friability. We conclude that since the infant was exclusively breast-fed, the milk protein must have passed into the breast milk antigenically intact. Prenatal sensitization probably occurred. Cow's milk induced allergic colitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of colitis in breast-fed neonates.\r"

The vast majority of colorectal carcinomas are associated with adenomatous polyps of the large intestine. Colonoscopy is the best procedure available to evaluate those at risk; the double-contrast barium enema and flexible sigmoidoscopy also play a significant role in diagnosis. Screening for occult blood in the stool is presently the best tool to evaluate groups for potential colorectal lesions. Although there are still significant problems with occult blood testing, it can account for a definite decrease in morbidity and mortality from colorectal carcinoma.\r"

Active specific immunotherapy using the patient's tumor cells to create a vaccine may improve the rate of survival in a disease for which no adequate adjuvant therapy currently exists. Further basic scientific and clinical research involving diagnostic and treatment modalities for colorectal carcinoma may lead to improved patient survival rates in the future.\r"

The relation of unopposed estrogen stimulation to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and the published studies relating ERT to endometrial cancer, have resulted in the clinical perception--and cautionary statements to that effect--that estrogen is contraindicated for patients with a history of endometrial carcinoma. The exact biologic effects of ERT on endometrial adenocarcinoma have not yet been studied adequately, however; the initial clinical data suggest that there is no increase in recurrence or mortality. In the meantime, the clinician is left with contradictory data as a basis for determining the proper management of symptomatic patients. The total impact of estrogen deficiency on the health of women and the ratio of benefits and risks of ERT are yet to be defined completely. The preponderance of evidence suggests that estrogen has a beneficial effect on the major cause of death in women, coronary heart disease, by increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction of cholesterol. It is established that estrogen prevents the demineralization of bone and delays the ravages of osteoporosis. No one has died from vaginal atrophy, bladder dysfunction, or hot flashes; the quality of life and marriage have been improved, however, by relieving these symptomatic conditions with ERT. Several studies have attempted to analyze with various statistical models the ratio of benefits to risks, and the majority of authors have concluded that the beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease alone clearly outweighs any known risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean percent of the ingested dose excreted in a 24-hr urine sample was 2.8 +/- 1.6% in 11 healthy controls, 10.8 +/- 10.2% (P less than 0.001) in 21 ulcerative colitis patients, 8.0 +/- 4.7% (P less than 0.001) in 35 Crohn's disease patients, 5.1 +/- 2.9% (P less than 0.01) in 17 patients with heterogeneous digestive disease diagnoses, and 3.2 +/- 4.7% (P greater than 0.05) in 33 patients with hepatobiliary diagnoses. Among ambulatory patients, Crohn's disease subjects, but not ulcerative colitis patients, had greater urinary recovery than the controls (P less than 0.05). The Crohn's disease activity index correlated positively with the radionuclide recovery in Crohn's subjects (r = 0.455, P less than 0.02). In a heterogeneous sample of subjects simultaneous ingestion of [99mTc]DTPA and [51Cr]EDTA produced urinary levels that were correlated positively (r = 0.556, P less than 0.001). Increased absorption of [99mTc]DTPA relative to [51Cr]EDTA, however, was noted in ulcerative colitis patients (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated by utilizing [99mTc]DTPA in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Although this observation appears to be a nonspecific indicator of injury, the test provides a simple objective means of establishing disease activity, which possibly may be utilized for therapeutic and investigative studies.\r"

The etiology remains unknown, but the incidence correlates with genetic as well as environmental factors. Screening programs have been shown to prolong the survival by early detection compared with control populations but remain underutilized by physicians and patients. Breast disease can be evaluated by physical examination and mammography and a definitive diagnosis made by needle aspiration, needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. This allows the patient to participate in the decision regarding mastectomy vs. conservative surgery plus radiation therapy. These two approaches have equivalent survival in selected patients. Patients with locally advanced, nonmetastatic disease benefit from a multidisciplinary approach using preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative radiation therapy. This approach has allowed less disfiguring surgery and improved survival. Preinvasive carcinoma is diagnosed more frequently with the increased use of screening mammography. Local therapy options include simple mastectomy, local excision plus radiation, or local excision alone. The natural history and results of therapy in preinvasive disease are evolving as more data are accumulated. Systemic adjuvant therapy is recommended for all node-positive patients and most node-negative patients with invasive cancer. The specific modality (hormonal or cytotoxic) varies with the subgroup involved. Treatment of metastatic disease to palliate symptoms and prolong survival includes the use of local therapies (surgery and radiation) and hormonal and cytotoxic agents. Most patients benefit, but cure has been unobtainable. Newer approaches utilizing high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow support with growth factors or autologous transplantation are currently being explored.\r"

Children in the experimental group (n = 123) and their parents separately attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Control children (n = 113) and their parents attended three 2-h sessions with a traditional lecture followed by question-and-answer format. All participants were pretested and then retested 5 months after completion of the educational intervention. Although there was some knowledge increase among children in the control group, the knowledge of children in the experimental group was significantly enhanced in a variety of areas related to management of their seizures and unnecessary restriction of their social and play activities. There was a significant increase in the self-perceptions of social competency of children in the experimental group. Children in the experimental group without serious behavioral problems also reported significantly better behavior after the intervention than did control children. There was no impact on children's disclosure of their diagnosis to friends and others.\r"

The interview was administered over the telephone by trained lay interviewers. Interview-based diagnoses for 50 patients were compared with independent diagnoses by neurologists who also use the ILAE system for seizure classification. Interview diagnoses agreed with those of physicians for broad seizure-type classifications (i.e., partial vs. generalized onset) in 88% of patients and for detailed combinations of seizure type in 64% of patients. Nonchance agreement between the two sources, assessed by the kappa statistic, was excellent for any partial onset (kappa = 0.83), secondarily generalized (kappa = 0.81), and primary generalized tonic-clonic (kappa = 0.76) seizures. Agreement was fair to good for any generalized onset (kappa = 0.70), simple partial (kappa = 0.56), complex partial (kappa = 0.54), and generalized nonconvulsive (kappa = 0.56) seizures. Sensitivity ranged from 0.60 to 1.0 for partial onset seizures, and from 0.43 to 0.67 for generalized onset seizures. Specificity ranged from 0.60 to 0.87 for partial onset seizures, and was 1.0 for generalized onset seizures. Positive predictive value was 0.95 for any partial onset and 1.0 for any generalized onset seizure. These results suggest that this interview can produce accurate diagnoses of major seizure categories. Use of this instrument for clinical epilepsy research should facilitate conduct of large studies at a significant saving of both time and money.\r"

  ".U": "90152156\r", 
  ".W": "Impaired islet function is a feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which is manifested in part by disproportionate proinsulin release. A disproportionate increase in proinsulin also occurs in insulinomas, suggesting that enhanced proinsulin release results from an increase in synthesis and premature release of proinsulin-rich immature granules in both conditions. However, recent human and animal studies suggest that normal beta-cells respond to an increase in synthetic demand by enhancing their ability to process proinsulin. Thus, impaired processing of proinsulin is likely in NIDDM. A new point of similarity with insulinoma has been the demonstration of a novel pancreatic peptide isolated from insulinomas and the pancreas of patients with NIDDM. This peptide, named islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin, is also present in normal islets. Because of its association with two apparently dissimilar disease states, we propose a hypothesis that encompasses the observations related to proinsulin and islet amyloid polypeptide and suggest they are manifestations of the same abnormality. In this hypothesis, we suggest that this new pancreatic peptide is a normal participant in the process of proinsulin processing and storage. We also suggest that in the presence of defective proinsulin processing and insulin release, as occurs in NIDDM, hyperglycemia stimulates amylin biosynthesis so that this peptide is deposited in increased quantities in the islet as amyloid. This then further exacerbates the diabetic process, resulting in progressive hyperglycemia and deterioration in islet function.\r"

To determine if neuroendocrine agents play a role during this time, we studied the effects of selected peptides and neurotransmitters on insulin release and polyphosphoinositide metabolism in islets isolated from 1- and 3-day neonatal rats. Vasoactive intestinal peptide had no effect on glucose-stimulated release in either islet population. In contrast, sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin release in both islet groups. One-day islets were stimulated only by a concentration of 300 nM, whereas 3-day islets were responsive at 3 nM. Similar to CCK-8, there were clear differences in responses to carbachol between 1- and 3-day islets. One-day islets required a concentration of 200 microM for insulin release to be significantly greater than with glucose alone; 3-day islet insulin release was significant at 2 microM carbachol. Both agonists stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in 3-day islets, but only CCK-8 caused a significant increase over glucose-induced levels in 1-day islets. These results indicate that islet responsiveness to CCK-8 and carbachol develops in parallel during the early neonatal period. This development may be linked to the maturation of a critical step of stimulus-secretion coupling through which these agents act.\r"

Comparisons were made with a control study with the same insulin infusion rate but where hypoglycemia was prevented by glucose infusion. Glucose production and utilization were studied with D-[3-3H] glucose infusions. Hypoglycemia induced marked insulin resistance shown by lower glucose infusion rates compared with the control study 3.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.7 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than .001). This late posthypoglycemic insulin resistance was mainly due to a decreased insulin effect on glucose utilization. Infusion of propranolol did not prevent insulin resistance, whereas somatostatin partially prevented its appearance. Somatostatin plus metyrapone completely normalized posthypoglycemic insulin resistance. A positive correlation (r = .72, P less than .001) was found between initial insulin sensitivity and percent reduction of the insulin effect after hypoglycemia. Thus, hypoglycemia is followed by prolonged (6- to 8-h) insulin resistance. In contrast to early-phase (2- to 3-h) resistance, long-term resistance is not due to beta-adrenergic stimulation but to the combined effect of growth hormone and cortisol. This resistance is also more pronounced in subjects with initially high insulin sensitivity.\r"

Appropriate experimental models may aid in understanding its pathogenesis and in developing therapeutic strategies.

We studied nerve conduction in both motor (peroneal, median, and ulnar) and sensory (median and ulnar) nerves in 13 adult male rhesus monkeys, 4 overtly diabetic and 9 nondiabetic (mean age 21 +/- 2 and 16 +/- 2 yr, respectively, NS; mean fasting plasma glucose 14.5 +/- 3.4 and 4.4 +/- 0.6 mM, P = .001). The diabetic animals had significantly reduced motor conduction velocities and prolonged F-wave latencies. Motor-evoked amplitudes did not differ. In the diabetic monkeys, nerve conduction times were increased in motor fibers, which could be identified as early as 2 yr after the onset of hyperglycemia. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in humans and suggest further study of these animals as a primate model of human diabetic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "In the insulin-secreting, glucose-insensitive islet cell subclone RINm5F, the distribution of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the cytosol and membrane fractions was determined, and the activation of the enzyme, as reflected in its translocation to the membrane fraction, was characterized in conjunction with insulin release. DL-Glyceraldehyde (15 mM) evoked a rapid redistribution of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction; insulin release increased concomitantly. When monitored over 5 min with 15 mM glyceraldehyde, membrane stabilization of PKC reached a maximum at 30 s and decreased thereafter; insulin release occurred at a high rate for the first 15 s and diminished thereafter. With 2-20 mM glyceraldehyde, a dose-dependent increase in membrane stabilization of PKC occurred and was accompanied by a matching increase in insulin release. Exogenous 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (100 microM) induced a rapid membrane stabilization of PKC and concomitant stimulation of insulin release. Glucose (15 mM) failed to evoke any redistribution of PKC or release of insulin. Depletion of total PKC activity by 95% induced by 18-h incubations with 2 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in a 67-91% reduction in glyceraldehyde-induced insulin release. We conclude that in the RINm5F islet beta-cell subclone 1) the rapid activation of PKC, which occurs in response to the administration of glyceraldehyde, a nutrient secretagogue, plays an amplifying role in the initiation of stimulated insulin release; and 2) the failure of the activation of PKC may be responsible for the insensitivity to glucose.\r"

Adult and fetal rat pancreatic islets were prepared and cultured under different conditions in vitro. The total RNA from these islets and from the insulin-producing RINm5F cells was isolated and analyzed by the Northern blot technique via a cDNA clone (pAAC-9) coding for the bovine ANT. We found that a 1600-base pair (bp) mRNA hybridizing to the pAAC-9 clone could be detected in RINm5F cells, and a 1450-bp mRNA was similarly observed in the islets. These sizes correspond well to previously reported forms of mRNA for the ANT observed in other tissues. When comparing the intensities of the pAAC-9 hybridizing bands of the different islet groups, it was observed that fetal islets contained less of this mRNA than adult islets. Furthermore, the content of the ANT mRNA in adult islets cultured at a high glucose concentration was increased compared with islets cultured at a low glucose concentration. Finally, streptozocin-treated islets, which display an impaired glucose-sensitive insulin release after 6 days in culture, also contained less of this mRNA than the control islets. We conclude that pancreatic islet cells express an mRNA that appears to be highly homologous to the bovine ANT and that the contents of this mRNA increases with the functional status of the beta-cell. It is furthermore suggested that defects in the expression of this gene may be associated with impaired glucose sensitivity.\r"

Many investigators have shown that vanadium, or its salts, counteracts the hyperglycemia associated with streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D) in the rat, although insulin secretion remains depressed. Studies of the action of vanadate on insulin secretion and glucose metabolism have not addressed the question of possible long-term effects of this compound on glucose metabolism extending beyond the period of oral administration. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of treatment (3 wk) and withdrawal of vanadyl sulfate (13 wk) on glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, and islet insulin content of STZ-D rats. Our results indicate that STZ-D rats that have had blood glucose levels normalized by 3 wk of vanadyl treatment remain normoglycemic after 13 wk of withdrawal from treatment. Normal glucose tolerance was observed in vanadyl-treated diabetic animals despite depressed fasting and glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels. Insulin secretion from the isolated perfused pancreas was greater after vanadyl treatment than in untreated diabetic rats, although it was only 12% of values from controls. Three weeks of vanadyl treatment of STZ-D rats, followed by 13 wk of withdrawal, yielded islets close in size and insulin content of control islets, even though in vivo and in vitro insulin secretion was impaired. This study has shown that short-term vanadyl treatment of STZ-D rats yields normalization of glucose tolerance and protection of islets from destruction by STZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ICAs were detected in 74% of the patients, and beta-cell function was detected in 84% of the patients at onset. The ICA+ and ICA- groups had similar C-peptide values at diagnosis and at 3 mo, but from 6 mo on, the ICA+ group consistently showed a tendency to lose C-peptide secretory capacity more quickly when assessed by fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide levels (ICA+ vs. ICA- fasting C-peptide levels at 18 and 24 mo, P = .013 and .017, respectively; ICA+ vs. ICA- glucagon-stimulated C-peptide levels at 6, 18, and 24 mo, P = .023, .007, and .028, respectively). The initial ICA titer had the highest predictive value on the outcome of beta-cell function (P = .04), and patients with complement-fixing ICAs did not behave differently from the general ICA+ group. This correlation between beta-cell function and ICA titer supports the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes and has important implications for the design of immunotherapy trials.\r"

Blood glucose levels in FOD mice were reduced (12.5 vs. 28 mM for COD mice, P less than .001) 60 days after STZ injection with a diet in which 20% of the calories were from fish oil. In FOD mice, immunohistology showed reduced numbers of class II antigen-expressing cells in pancreatic islets followed by a decreased extent of insulitis. FOD significantly decreased the number of Fc receptor-negative dendritic cells in cytospin preparations of islets isolated from diabetic mice. Interleukin 1-like activity of peritoneal exudate cell supernatants isolated from mice on FOD was reduced. FOD did not improve insulin secretion of isolated islets from LDSTZ-D mice. These data indicate a beneficial effect of FOD on the immune component of the mouse LDSTZ-D model.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of 24 h of exposure to various glucose concentrations on insulin secretion by isolated rat pancreatic islets and purified rat beta-cells. Compared with islets cultured with standard medium (5.5 mM glucose), islets cultured with 16.7 mM glucose showed a higher basal insulin release (means +/- SE, 3.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.2%, n = 8, P less than .005) and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (2.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.4%, n = 8, P less than .005). Similar results were also obtained with purified beta-cells. The effect of high glucose was time dependent (present after 12 h, maximal after 24 h) and reversible: when islets cultured with high glucose were transferred to standard medium, normal responsiveness to glucose was restored within 8 h and normal basal release within 24 h. Mannitol, 3-O-methylglucose, and 2-deoxyglucose were not able to mimic the effects of glucose. Islets or purified beta-cells cultured in the presence of high glucose had a normal response when stimulated with glyburide, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-terminal glycosylation, prevented glucose-induced desensitization when added during 24 h of islet culture with 16.7 mM glucose. Swainsonine, another agent that influences glycosylation, had a similar effect. Our study indicates 1) that 24 h of exposure to high glucose induces a specific and reversible impairment of insulin secretion in response to glucose, 2) that this is a direct effect of glucose on beta-cells, and 3) that islet glucose metabolism and glycosylation processes may play a critical role in determining glucose desensitization.\r"

  ".W": "If a single gene produced insulin resistance, with environmental effects creating some additional variance, insulin action might be distributed as a mixture of two normal distributions if the gene is dominant or recessive or as a mixture of three normal distributions if the gene is codominant. To estimate maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake rates (MaxMs), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed on 245 nondiabetic Pima Indians (126 men, 119 women). Five models (for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 components each, normally distributed with a common variance) were fitted to the frequency distribution of MaxM by iterative maximum-likelihood estimation. The three-component model fit the data significantly better than a single normal distribution (chi 2 = 14.3 with 4 df P less than .01) or a mixture of two normal distributions (chi 2 = 9.9 with 2 df, P less than .01). Mixtures of four or five normal distributions did not fit the data significantly better than a mixture of three normal distributions. The first component of the distribution comprised 23%, the second 48%, and the third 29% of the total distribution. Similarly, the frequency distributions of fasting plasma insulin concentrations and a principal component score derived from MaxM and fasting insulin were best fitted by a mixture of three normal distributions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that among Pimas, insulin resistance is determined by a single gene with a codominant mode of inheritance. Segregation analyses of studies performed in pedigrees are indicated to prove or disprove this genetic hypothesis.\r"

In lean +/? mice, plasma glucose decreased in response to 1 and 2 micrograms/g bethanechol chloride, whereas insulin increased significantly. In ob/ob mice, insulin increased remarkably in response to bethanechol administration (saline, 632 +/- 80 microU/ml; 2 micrograms/g bethanechol chloride, 1794 +/- 97 microU/ml; n = 10), but surprisingly, plasma glucose also rose significantly (saline, 230 +/- 14 mg/dl; 2 micrograms/g bethanechol chloride, 363 +/- 18 mg/dl, n = 10). This exaggerated hyperglycemia in ob/ob mice was not associated with significant changes in plasma glucagon. Furthermore, administration of propranolol hydrochloride did not diminish bethanechol chloride-induced hyperglycemia in ob/ob mice. Administration of atropine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg body wt) induced a significant decrease in plasma insulin without changes in plasma glucose in ob/ob mice, whereas neither plasma insulin nor plasma glucose changed in lean mice. Finally, conversion of [14C]alanine to glucose was increased in ob/ob mice after bethanechol chloride administration, indicating that muscarinic stimulation increases gluconeogenesis in an animal model of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Recent biochemical studies have shown that the cytoplasmic islet cell-antibody autoantigen has properties of a monosialoganglioside (GM). To characterize islet glycolipids and ascertain whether islets express unique gangliosides, we determined the pattern of ganglioside expression in whole human pancreas and isolated human islets using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The major gangliosides detected in glycolipid extracts of whole human pancreas were GM3, GD3 (disialoganglioside), and in a lesser amount, a GD1a-comigrating ganglioside. In contrast to whole human pancreas, isolated human islets were found to predominantly express GM3, an acidic glycolipid comigrating with GM2, and a ganglioside with mobility between GM2 and GM1 by both HPLC and HPTLC. Quantitation of the major ganglioside UV peaks seen on HPLC gave the following results. In whole pancreas, GM3 represented 66.7% of total gangliosides detected; an asialoglycolipid comigrating with GM2, 2.0%; a ganglioside migrating between GM2 and GM1, 2.6%; GD3, 22.6%; and a GD1a-comigrating ganglioside, 6.1%. In isolated islets, these components were found at the following levels: GM3, 14.9%; GM2-comigrating glycolipid, 74.2%; a ganglioside migrating between GM2 and GM1, 9.8%; GD3, 1.1%; and the GD1a-comigrating ganglioside, not detectable.\r"

Macrophages and Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ cells have been demonstrated to be involved in beta-cell destruction in this model. The role of a specific subset of T-lymphocytes expressing a particular T-lymphocyte-receptor segment was examined in CY-induced diabetic NOD mice with a mouse anti-V beta 8 T-lymphocyte-receptor monoclonal antibody (F23.1). After administration of CY, only 4 of 51 treated mice became hyperglycemic compared to 23 of 47 untreated mice, 13 of 26 mice treated with an isotype-matched control ascites, and 4 of 6 mice given antibody-negative ascites. Insulitis was significantly reduced in the F23.1-treated group, and immunocytochemistry revealed the absence of V beta 8 expression on cells in the lymphoid organs and insulitis of these mice. This investigation revealed that V beta 8+ cells were implicated in CY-induced diabetes in NOD/Wehi mice.\r"

The effects of Ang II were found to depend on the culture conditions. After 72 hours of serum-free culture, the differentiated function of cultured cells such as Ang II-induced aldosterone secretion was suppressed, and DNA synthesis was stimulated by Ang II. After 24 hours of serum-free culture, the cells showed a good steroidogenic response and DNA synthesis was inhibited after Ang II was added in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-11) to 10(-7) M). Ang II was detected in 24 hours of culture grown in a serum-free medium by a specific Ang II radioimmunoassay. Ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that this immunoreactive (ir) Ang II was composed mainly of Ang II with small amounts of angiotensin III (Ang III). The concentration of irAng II in the cultured medium was significantly reduced by the addition of captopril, indicating de novo generation and secretion of Ang II. Captopril (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) reduced aldosterone secretion and reciprocally increased DNA synthesis. Ang II antagonist, [Sar1, Ile8] Ang II, increased DNA synthesis presumably by competitive blockade of locally synthesized Ang II. In summary, Ang II inhibited cell proliferation. In addition to exogenous (circulating) Ang II, Ang II was generated and secreted by the glomerulosa cells themselves, and this locally synthesized Ang II appeared to work as an autocrine factor to stimulate aldosterone secretion and to suppress cell proliferation.\r"

Angiotensin I (Ang I) (0.15 microgram/kg i.v.) elevated mean arterial blood pressure by 18 +/- 1 mm Hg in the renal experimental group and 19 +/- 1 mm Hg in the femoral experimental group; it decreased renal blood flow by 35 +/- 3% but increased femoral blood flow by 31 +/- 8%. All these effects were blocked by intravenous administration of captopril (2 mg/kg bolus injection plus 1 mg/kg/hr). Captopril also lowered mean arterial pressure by 17 +/- 3 and 16 +/- 2 mm Hg in the renal and femoral experimental groups, respectively, and it increased renal blood flow by 32 +/- 10% but reduced femoral blood flow by 21 +/- 4%. As a result, renal vascular resistance was decreased by 36 +/- 5%, but femoral vascular resistance remained unchanged. After captopril, plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were decreased and Ang I levels increased in the two groups. The renal venous-arterial difference of Ang I was increased by captopril, but the femoral venous-arterial difference of Ang I was not, suggesting greater generation of Ang I in the kidney. In a separate group of bilateral nephrectomized rabbits, plasma Ang II levels as well as mean arterial pressure, femoral blood flow, and femoral vascular resistance were not changed by intravenous administration of captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
