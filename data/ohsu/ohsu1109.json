  ".W": "The instantaneous regional stress distribution within the myocardium, which cannot be directly measured, has been estimated using improved numerical methods and nonaxisymmetric biventricular geometry. To do this, we have employed computer-aided solid mathematical modeling to generate a three-dimensional representation for an ex vivo canine biventricular unit using magnetic resonance imaging. A two-dimensional transverse section was isolated from the solid mathematical model for regional stress analysis using p-version finite element analysis. Loading conditions and material property descriptions were taken from published reports. Analyses showed the maximum principal stresses to range from -1.76 X 10(5) to 8.52 X 10(5) dynes/cm2 during systolic loading, and from -3.85 X 10(4) to 1.13 X 10(5) dynes/cm2 during diastolic loading. This study demonstrates that magnetic resonance image-based solid mathematical biventricular models are suitable for regional stress analysis using p-version finite element analysis. p-Version finite element analysis using magnetic resonance image-based cardiac representations facilitates in vivo stress-strain analyses and may allow the clinical estimation of regional myocardial stress.\r"

  ".U": "91321308\r", 
  ".W": "Extracardiac valved conduits represent one of the weakest facets of reconstructive surgery for congenital heart disease in that they invariably need to be replaced because of growth of the patient or because of valve or conduit failure. Between 1979 and 1989, 141 patients had 169 valved conduits placed between the heart and the pulmonary artery circuit. There were 81 male and 60 female patients, aged 2 days to 35 years (mean age, 5.9 years), with 46 patients less than 1 year of age. We performed primary repair in 117 patients; in this group, there have been 28 conduit replacements in 27 patients. In 17 patients initial repair with a conduit was performed elsewhere and we replaced these conduits in 15 and removed them in 2. A further group of 9 patients were seen after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or double-outlet right ventricle, with severe pulmonary incompetence or right ventricular outflow tract aneurysm. All had valved conduits inserted as secondary procedures. The types of valved conduits used were xenograft (n = 126) and homograft (n = 43). There were six hospital deaths (3.6%; 70% confidence limits [CL], 2% to 6%) and seven late deaths (4.1%; CL, 2.5% to 6.5%) in a total of 169 conduit insertions. Forty-five conduits have been removed and 43 reinserted without early or late mortality (0%; CL, 0% to 4%). Actuarial survival after conduit insertion was 87% at 5 years (CL, 80% to 92%), including operative mortality. Actuarial freedom from conduit replacement was 37% at 5 years (CL, 20% to 56%). Conduit insertion in infants and small children ensures subsequent replacement, but this can be done at low risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical examination was negative, but chest roentgenograms and computed tomography showed a mass in the right upper chest wall involving the third rib. A 2 x 2 x 1.5-cm tumor was excised totally with partial resection of the third rib. The histology of the lesion corresponded to a mesenchymoma (hamartoma) of the chest wall.

Echocardiography established the presence, severity, and cause of the mitral regurgitation and the associated hyperdynamic left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Transesophageal echocardiography is excellent for assessing the mitral valve in critically ill patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography may be inadequate or misleading. This allowed for emergency mitral valve replacement without prolonged attempts at medical stabilization.\r"

Eight percent of these patients require subsequent esophagomyotomy. Surgical procedures for achalasia can be performed through either an abdominal or a thoracic incision. Nearly all authors favoring an abdominal approach add an antireflux operation to esophagomyotomy, whereas many authors advocating a transthoracic esophagomyotomy believe that an antireflux wrap is unnecessary. Overall results for the various surgical approaches used as initial therapy are excellent, with symptomatic improvement in 89% of patients, a mortality rate of less than 1%, and development of gastroesophageal acid reflux in less than 10%. Factors governing the choice of initial therapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In the 1940s Canada and the United States had similar lack of structure and reimbursement for diagnostic, hospital, and physician services. In Canada over the next 40 years there evolved a complex system mandated and partially funded by the federal government, but administered and delivered through 10 provincial and 2 territorial jurisdictions. Each must negotiate with federal government on cost sharing and deal with hospital budgets and physician compensation at the provincial or territorial level. The Medical Care Act of 1966 enshrined in law the five principles of public administration, universality, comprehensiveness, portability, and accessibility, converting all medical services in Canada from a privilege to a right. Any patient participation in hospital or physician charges came under increasing political attack. In 1984 the Canada Health Act specified financial penalties in federal transfer payments to provinces that permitted any direct patient charges. While Canada has \"contained\" health expenditures at 8.7% of gross national product, universal access to quality care is increasingly subject to rationing. The relationship between the profession and governments hard pressed to fund escalating costs in a deteriorating economy has been one of increasingly bitter confrontations. There have been four acrimonious doctors' strikes. More optimistically, there is now an emerging recognition of society's need to have physicians actively participating with other providers and governments to create a balance between access to quality health services and both public and private funding.\r"

The methodology used by Abt Associates to measure the total work of surgical procedures is described, and differences between the Abt methodology and that used in the Harvard study are highlighted. The report also compares the total work measured by the Harvard and Abt studies for several specific operations. Discrepancies in relative total work measures between the two studies are shown to result primarily from differences in the measurement of preoperative and postoperative work. Background information on responding physicians is summarized. Physicians asked to respond to the survey were randomly selected from a combined list of all members of the six cardiothoracic and vascular organizations as well as those physicians included on the American Medical Association Masterfile with a primary specialty indication of cardiovascular, general thoracic, or peripheral vascular surgery. Therefore, these data should be reasonably representative of the cardiothoracic and vascular surgery profession as a whole. Information provided includes board certification status, age, sex, practice type, reimbursement source, hours worked per week, and number of operations performed. In addition, data describe the types of hospitals at which cardiothoracic and vascular surgeons typically practice. The survey also provides data on current surgical practice. Statistics are available on the average number of various types of operations surgeons perform, and on what percentage are reoperations. Finally, the work of reoperations and emergency procedures relative to primary elective operations is compared directly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 1989, the College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Ill, instituted a voluntary quality assurance program, called \"Q-Probes,\" that utilized nationwide interinstitutional peer comparison. One of the anatomic pathology modules retrospectively assessed performance in fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the breast from cytohistologic correlations that were made in 294 institutions by 988 pathologists on their own cases that were accessioned during a 6-month period. Of the 13,066 cases of FNAC, 10,751 (82%) were satisfactory for evaluation. Of these satisfactory aspirates, 3471 cases (33%) had histologic correlation, which formed the basis for determining diagnostic accuracy. Of breast aspirates, 2254 (17%) were unsatisfactory for evaluation, with the mean frequency of unsatisfactory aspirates obtained by nonpathologists (18%), ie, more than twice that of unsatisfactory aspirates obtained by pathologists (7.2%). In the diagnosis of breast cancer by FNAC, the following performance results were derived with the use of the aggregate data: 82% sensitivity of the FNAC procedure, 97% sensitivity of diagnosis, 97% specificity, 95% positive predictive value, 86% negative predictive value, and 90% efficiency. No significant difference in performance was detected when institutions were stratified by six peer group characteristics. We made the following conclusions: (1) the aggregate and median breast FNAC performance values obtained from this interinstitutional comparison of data from routine procedures performed in diverse settings in North America compared very favorably with performance from single institutions published in studies of similar design in the literature, and (2) these data may provide a reference point for participant institutions to measure future quality improvement in fine-needle aspiration of breast.\r"

Although its sensitivity for malignancy is high, a negative (benign) diagnosis is obtained in 5% to 25% of all cases. Some of these aspirates represent the result of inadequate sampling of a malignant tumor; others, however, are derived from a truly benign process. This review briefly describes and illustrates the cytologic features of these latter aspirates in order to exemplify the wide range of benign diseases that can be identified or suspected by transthoracic needle aspiration. Familiarity with such features should help the interpreting pathologist to prevent needless respiration or thoracotomy in many patients.\r"

  ".W": "Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions.\r"

We present the results of an autopsy study in which sudden and unexpected deaths associated with coronary anomalies were found in three children (less than 2 years of age). In two cases, death was not associated with exercise. In two case, the myocardium was morphologically normal, and in the third case, there was an extensive recent anterior myocardial infarct with a background of established fibrosis. Coronary artery anomalies may be easily overlooked in this age group because of small vessel size and difficulty in dissection; this is particularly so when there are normally placed ostia. One consequence of this is potential for confusion with sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

In a cell culture system that used explants to harvest MVICs, we found that after several passages, some of the cultures at confluence formed a monolayer of cobblestone-shaped cells (CB type). The rest of the cultures were, however, different, consisting of elongated cells (EL type) that formed overlapping orthogonal patterns. When compared with the MVICs-EL, cells from cultures of MVICs-CB were less adherent to a plastic substratum initially than were MVICs-EL and were more sensitive to trypsinization following culture for 3 to 7 days. Ultrastructurally, the cultures of MVICs-CB showed prominent Golgi's complexes and endoplasmic reticulum and fewer microfilaments when compared with those of MVICs-EL. Most strikingly, the CB cells contained much less alpha-smooth-muscle cell actin compared with that of EL cells. The MVICs-CB were not endothelial cells as they did not show the characteristic dense peripheral band that was present in endothelial cells in a confluent monolayer and showed only trace amounts of fluorescence when incubated with 1,1-dioctadecyl 1-3,3,3,3 tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine-percholate (Dil-)--acetylated low-density lipoprotein compared with large amounts of fluorescence with endothelial cells. Cells that were morphologically similar to MVICs-CB were present in the in vivo valve as well and also formed small islands of cells even in the primary cultures that grew out of the explant. The findings supported the hypothesis that MVICs-CB represent a distinct phenotype of the MVICs that is different from that of the MVICs-EL and is not that of either endothelial or medial smooth-muscle cells.\r"

Both patients had no constitutional symptoms or underlying serologic abnormalities suggestive of systemic angitis. To our knowledge, pancreas-limited arteritis has not previously been described. Whether these lesions represent an early manifestation of a systemic arteritides syndrome, a variant of polyarteritis nodosa, or a distinct entity should be prudently judged through a long-term follow-up.\r"

The goal of this study was to establish the rhesus monkey as an animal model of coronary heart disease (CHD). From a colony of 160 rhesus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet, we identified 14 monkeys with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence of CHD. When compared with 14 rhesus monkeys matched for age, gender, and dietary history with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, monkeys with CHD had higher arterial blood pressures (mean +/- SEM, 92 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 75 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 1.70 +/- 0.25 mmol/L vs 2.32 +/- 0.28 mmol/L [66 +/- 10 mg/dL vs 90 +/- 11 mg/dl]), and lower A-l apolipoprotein concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 200 +/- 17 mg/dL vs 252 +/- 15 mg/dL). Monkeys with CHD tended to have higher total plasma cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 11.6 +/- 1.55 mmol/L vs 9.36 +/- 0.93 mmol/L [450 +/- 60 mg/dL vs 362 +/- 36 mg/dL]) and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 8.71 +/- 1.75 mmol/L vs 6.12 +/- 0.90 mmol/L [337 +/- 68 mg/dL vs 237 +/- 35 mg/dl]) than monkeys with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. We conclude that rhesus monkeys, like human beings, develop CHD as a complication of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Furthermore, risk factors for CHD in rhesus monkeys and human beings are similar.\r"

  ".U": "91321381\r", 
  ".W": "The histogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has been the subject of controversy, much of which has centered around whether the spindle cells of KS are derived from vascular endothelium or from lymphatics. Recently, some investigators have speculated that the spindle cells of KS are derived from dermal dendrocytes, a population of mononuclear dendritic cells normally present in the papillary and upper reticular dermis. These cells have been shown to proliferate in response to a variety of stimuli and have been reported to express the plasma proenzyme factor XIIIa. We examined immunohistochemically sections fixed in formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin from 20 tumor-stage, 15 patch-stage, and 15 plaque-stage lesions of KS with antibodies directed against factor XIIIa, factor VIII-related antigen, Ulex europaeus lectin, and LN3 (anti-HLA-DR) to investigate the relationship of dermal dendrocytes to KS in general and to try to clarify the histogenesis of this tumor. Our results revealed that the dermis of patch- and plaque-stage KS lesions contains an increased number of factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes compared with normal dermis and that some of these cells are spindle shaped. Many of the spindle cells in patch- and plaque-stage lesions of KS, however, are negative for factor XIIIa. The cells lining the slitlike spaces and some spindle-shaped cells in close proximity to the vascular spaces stain for factor VIII-related antigen and for Ulex europaeus lectin. LN3 labeled many cells resembling macrophages within the lesions and in papillary dermis. Less than 25% of the dendritic cells within the lesions and in the adjacent dermis expressed both factor XIIIa and LN3. Tumor-stage lesions showed focal but unequivocal staining of the spindle cells for factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus lectin. Tumor spindle cells were negative for factor XIIIa. Factor XIIIa-positive dendrocytes were plentiful in the uninvolved dermis and were aggregated around the periphery of the tumor nodules. The expression of factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus lectin by the spindle cells of nodular KS, and their lack of expression of factor XIIIa, suggests that the spindle-shaped tumor cells in all stages of KS are derived from endothelial cells and not from dermal dendrocytes. Dermal dendrocytes appear to undergo hyperplasia in response to KS of all stages. In patch- and early plaque-stage KS lesions, dermal dendrocytes are near factor VIII-related antigen-positive spindle cells and tumor vessels. The mechanism reactive dermal dendrocyte hyperplasia in KS remains obscure.\r"

P-Glycoprotein expression in the adenocarcinomas was also determined with the use of antibody C219. Significant changes in morphologic appearance of the tumor between prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy samples was noted in 17 tumors (32.7%). The most frequent changes observed in these 17 tumors were a decrease in tumor cellularity and an increase in dense fibrosis in comparison with the prechemotherapy specimen. In signet-ring cell carcinomas, the intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles were often smaller after chemotherapy, making tumor cells more difficult to identify. Another finding observed in tumors that showed histologic alteration after chemotherapy was the formation of large mucin pools that contained lymphocytes and macrophages. The remaining 35 tumors showed similar histologic features in prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy specimens. P-Glycoprotein was identified in 15 (29.4%) of 51 specimens after chemotherapy. P-Glycoprotein content of the residual tumors did not correlate with stage, degree of differentiation, or clinically determined chemotherapy response. We concluded that chemotherapy-induced changes in morphology were frequent in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemotherapy. These changes should be recognized as they may cause difficulties in both gross and histologic evaluation of the extent of tumor in postchemotherapy resection specimens. The response of adenocarcinomas to this chemotherapy protocol does not appear to be linked to P-glycoprotein expression.\r"

Many clinical laboratories centrifuge blood for routine coagulation assays from 500g to 2000g, with spin times varying from 20 to 5 minutes. Ninety blood samples, routinely submitted to our coagulation laboratory, were prospectively assayed simultaneously for the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen level, comparing centrifugation at 11,000g for 2 minutes with centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes. Routine and readily available equipment and supplies were used. Platelet counts were performed on the supernatant plasma in each sample to determine the efficacy of platelet depletion. Excellent correlation of methods was observed for the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen level. Platelet counts on the plasma supernatant showed no significant difference between the two centrifugation methods. We concluded that high-speed centrifugation at 11,000g with a shortened spin time of 2 minutes and with the use of routinely available equipment and supplies can significantly decrease the specimen preparation time for routine coagulation testing.\r"

These features and the finding of a predominantly sinusoidal infiltrate of neoplastic cells on liver biopsy raised the suspicion of malignant histiocytosis. The patient subsequently developed supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which proved to be due to a diffuse large-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypic studies performed on the lymph node and the original liver biopsy specimen established the B-cell nature of neoplastic cells at both sites. This case highlights a rare pattern of hepatic involvement by large-cell lymphoma, and contrasts the latter with other hematologic disorders associated with hepatic sinusoidal infiltrates.\r"

The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later. A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma. Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy. Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology.

Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity. One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each. Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not. All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment. Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies. Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment. Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis. An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each. Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride. Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4. These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors.\r"

Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival.\r"

Twenty-one patients were treated laparoscopically and eight underwent open choledocholithotomy. In 22 patients, a short cystic duct was seen that might otherwise have been overlooked, and possible injury was avoided. Cholangiography should be attempted routinely, so that in cases with abnormal findings, open cholecystectomy may be considered.\r"

Analysis was made to define factors that predisposed to failure of conservative treatment and characteristics that could predict the need for emergency biliary decompression. The age, incidence of concomitant medical diseases, previous biliary surgery, positive blood culture, bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics used, and multiplicity of bacterial strains in bile cultures in patients who required emergency intervention were similar to these factors in patients who had elective operations after successful conservative management. The incidence of intrahepatic segmental obstruction by stones or strictures was similar, but many more patients who required emergency intervention had concomitant extrahepatic obstruction due to impacted common ductal stones or strictures. Logistic regression analysis of clinical, hematological, and biochemical data showed that maximum pulse rate within 24 hours of presentation (greater than 100 beats per minute, relative risk, 2.8) and platelet count at the time of admission (less than 150 x 10(9)/L, relative risk, 5.2) were the factors with independent significance in predicting the need for emergency therapeutic procedures. This finding may serve as a guideline for identifying high-risk patients for early intervention.\r"

A mixed protein meal resulted in a sustained rise of circulating PP levels associated with a brief evaluation of ileal luminal PP levels. Fat meals were followed by elevations in plasma PP levels without luminal changes. Glucose ingestion altered neither plasma nor luminal PP levels. Our data support the existence of ileal PP-containing cells that respond independently of circulatory PP-releasing cells to different ingested stimuli.\r"

Anastomotic disruption leads to sepsis in the pancreatic bed where major vascular structures have been exposed by regional lymphadenectomy, creating a setting for arterial erosion or ligature slough and massive hemorrhage. Dehiscence of the pancreatojejunostomy is a particular risk. We treated five patients with arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy, all of whom had had \"sentinel\" bleeding from the abdominal drains or gastrointestinal tract. Results of endoscopy were misleading in two patients. Three of five patients were saved by prompt recognition, early operation, and, in one instance, angiographic embolization. Sentinel bleeding after pancreatoduodenectomy indicates local sepsis and probable anastomotic dehiscence. Recognition of its significance and prompt response may prevent exsanguination.\r"

In all age groups, especially the elderly, the majority of affected members had symptoms of only one endocrine disorder or were asymptomatic. In teenagers, the most common presentation was pituitary lesions and the second most common presentation was insulinomas. Frequently, pituitary lesions or insulinomas developed before any parathyroid lesions could be detected. Elevation of gastrin levels, usually associated with hypercalcemia, was rarely seen in patients younger than 25 years. The classic presentation with symptoms of multiple endocrinopathy may represent only a small fraction of these patients in the community.\r"

Conversely, it is hardly necessary to dwell on the heuristic value that an appreciation of history provides in developing adjunctive humanistic, literary, and philosophic tastes. Unfortunately, modern medical historians usually hold nonmedical degrees and basically restrict themselves to research concerning medical or public health aspects of social history. Clinical surgical history is increasingly avoided because the professional medical historian has no clinical background. However, practicing surgeons, who can serve as amateur medical historians, have knowledge and experience that place them in a unique position to assess historic facts and direct surgical historic inquiry. It is my belief that if medicine were taught with a greater emphasis on the historic approach, our country's physicians would be better prepared to cope with the health care problems of the future. By increasing the number of surgeons, who as an avocation, research and write about surgical history, our ability to provide better surgical care in our nation's coming years will be enhanced.\r"

One hundred twenty-nine patients (69%) had abnormal ejection fractions, and 88 (68%) of these subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. Sixty of the surgical specimens revealed pathologic changes. Eighty-four percent of patients successfully contacted for follow-up experienced complete relief, and another 13% had partial relief of preoperative symptoms. Only two patients reported no change in symptom complex. Twenty-nine patients with abnormal ejection fractions elected not to undergo surgery. Fifty-nine percent of these patients continued to experience symptoms of biliary colic at a mean follow-up of 22 months. Of the 44 patients with normal ejection fractions, 35 (80%) reported resolution of symptoms during follow-up of medical treatment.

  ".W": "Controversy about the appropriate evaluation of penetrating abdominal, flank, and back injuries prompted this retrospective review of 311 patients at an urban level 1 trauma center over 5 years. Seventy-five (24%) patients sustained gunshot wounds to the abdomen. All patients with gunshot wounds underwent exploratory laparotomy; results of 67 laparotomies (89%) were positive. Of 236 patients sustaining stab wounds (140 abdominal wounds, 51 flank wounds, 26 back wounds, and 19 wounds to multiple sites), 147 were treated according to a selective protocol, based on results of physical examination, wound exploration, peritoneal lavage, and ancillary diagnostic studies. No injuries were found at celiotomy in three (2%) of these 147 patients. One false-negative result of evaluation of a flank wound occurred. Significant injuries were found in 13 patients (68%) with stab wounds to multiple sites, 61 patients (44%) with abdominal stab wounds, 15 patients (29%) with flank stab wounds, and four patients (15%) with back stab wounds. Mandatory exploration of gunshot wounds is justified. Physical findings of intra-abdominal injury or positive results of peritoneal lavage identify stab wound victims likely to benefit from surgical exploration. A policy of mandatory observation or routine celiotomy for treatment of stab wounds is not justified.\r"

A 58% incidence of invasive cancer was detected for lesions characterized by calcifications, while the incidence of invasive cancer was 84% for isolated mass lesions (relative risk, 4.31 for masses). Isolated mammographic calcifications associated with cancer appeared in a younger population and were significantly associated with noninvasive ductal cancer. Breast cancer presenting as a mammographic mass appeared in an older group and was highly associated with the presence of invasive disease.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if conjugated diene-rich fractions extracted from the plasma of burned rats 3 hours after injury would alter humoral immune function in unburned animals. Plasma diene extracts from burned or normal rats were dissolved in ethanol and given intraperitoneally to Long-Evans rats. Fifteen minutes after diene injection, the rats were immunized with sheep erythrocytes. Five days later, serum and spleen cells obtained from these immunized rats were tested for IgM immunity against sheep erythrocytes. Both plaque-forming cells from spleen and hemagglutination titers in serum were significantly enhanced in the group treated with dienes obtained from the thermally injured rats. These data suggest that conjugated diene-bearing lipid fractions from burn plasma may modulate immune function and support the concept that humoral immunity is enhanced after thermal injury.\r"

Primary repair, including suture repair and resection with anastomosis, was performed in 614 patients (61%), colostomy in 284 patients (28%), and exteriorized repairs in 83 patients (8.3%). In the remaining 25 patients (2.5%) who were exsanguinating, the colon injuries were ligated. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (defined as a fecal fistula, abdominal abscess, stomal complication, or death from multisystem failure) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. These factors were used to match patients at similar risk within different treatment groups, and odds ratios for each treatment were calculated. The odds ratios for primary repair, colostomy, and exteriorized repair were 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. Therefore, the chance of an adverse outcome was twice as great for both exteriorized repair or colostomy as for primary repair. It is concluded that further increases in the use of primary repair are warranted.\r"

We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease. Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors. With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision. Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible.\r"

The records of 54 patients with pyogenic liver abscess were reviewed to determine whether earlier diagnosis with current imaging tests and definitive treatment with antibiotics, aspiration, or catheter drainage was an effective alternative to open drainage. Twenty-nine patients were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and diagnostic aspiration. Twenty-three (79%) recovered uneventfully, and six required catheter or operative drainage. Twenty-three patients (including five who failed aspiration) underwent drainage with percutaneously placed catheters. Nineteen (83%) recovered; four required open surgical drainage. Of seven patients who required open surgical drainage, six recovered. One (2%) of the 54 patients died following failed aspiration and catheter and surgical drainage. Four patients were successfully treated with antibiotics alone without aspiration. These results confirm that pyogenic liver abscess can be successfully treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and aspiration or percutaneous catheter drainage. Open surgical drainage is reserved for patients in whom treatment fails or who require celiotomy for concurrent disease.\r"

Results of this study suggest that most fishhook injuries involve the hands or head and that postremoval wound care including oral antibiotic therapy may not be critical. Local anesthetics and simple removal techniques are adequate for nearly all fishhook injuries. Routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary for uncomplicated soft tissue injury due to fishhooks not involving cartilage or tendons.\r"

Sera were analyzed for HIV-1 by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot and two rapid assays: the Abbott Testpack HIV-1 (Abbott Labs, Inc, Abbott Park, IL) and the HIV-1 Genie, (Genetic Systems, Seattle, WA). Seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 492 samples was 5.1%. Both rapid assays were easy to perform and required approximately 10 minutes per test. Sensitivity and specificity of both rapid assays were 100% and 99.8%, with positive and negative predictive values of 96.2% and 100%, respectively. It was concluded that both rapid assays showed high concordance with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Since the ED is often the primary care setting for many patients at risk for HIV-1, the ED may be an optimal site for routine HIV-1 screening. Rapid assay screening may provide the opportunity for timely identification of HIV-1-infected patients, allowing earlier treatment and counseling. However, ethical and practical questions regarding appropriate application of rapid HIV-1 testing in EDs still needs resolution.\r"

All cases of cervical spine fracture or dislocation seen at a level I trauma center over a 3-year period and at a rehabilitation center over a 10-year period were reviewed. The lateral radiograph, open-mouth odontoid radiograph, and AP radiograph of each case were sequentially examined by a neuroradiologist (blinded to the original diagnosis) to determine the contribution of each view in making a diagnosis of cervical spine injury. Results of these reviews showed that there were no cases of cervical spine injury evident on the AP view without an obvious corresponding abnormality on the lateral or open-mouth view. It was concluded that the AP view could be dropped from the initial screening radiographic study of the cervical spine in the trauma patient. Only an adequate lateral view and open-mouth odontoid view would then be necessary to initially evaluate the cervical spine in the trauma patient, and decisions to obtain further studies could be based safely on only the lateral and open-mouth views.\r"

The experiments were performed in adrenalectomized and in sham-operated dogs. In adrenalectomized dogs the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and basic life support (BLS) was markedly smaller than in sham-operated dogs. Intravenous infusion of physiologic doses of epinephrine during BLS in adrenalectomized animals did not influence the plasma norepinephrine concentrations. These data indicate that, as suggested by others, the marked increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during BLS in dogs is mainly of adrenomedullary origin. They also suggest that presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release by epinephrine is not important, but further experiments using higher doses of epinephrine are necessary.\r"

A total of 129 patients treated by the residents during this initial phase were assessed. During the second 2-month period, a 10-minute verbal presentation and explicit written treatment protocol were provided to another eight residents, and their treatment of 83 patients was covertly evaluated. Increased prescribing of desired therapy was significantly improved in every area except that of prescribing an inhaled steroid metered dose inhaler for use as a discharge medication. The 10-minute verbal presentation given in conjunction with a three-page handout was found to be highly effective for eliciting improvement in treatment practices during short clinical rotations. The duration of this effect beyond each rotation is unknown. This educational intervention should be presented by the ED medical director, clinical pharmacist, or other appropriate clinician in virtually any ED as quality of patient care can be dramatically improved.\r"

A dog model was used with ventricular fibrillation (VF) of 20 minutes, reperfusion with brief cardiopulmonary bypass, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. A retrospective comparison was made of the results of one series, now called \"group I\" (n = 10)--which received CPR basic life support interposed from VF 10 to 15 minutes, and CPR advanced life support with epinephrine (without defibrillation) from VF 15 to 20 minutes--to the results of another series, now \"control group II\" (n = 10)--which received VF no flow (no CPR) for 20 minutes. All 20 dogs within protocol were resuscitated. All 10 of group I and 7 of 10 of group II survived to 96 hours. Pupillary light reflex returned after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass at 7.7 +/- 3.7 minutes in CPR group I, versus 16.3 +/- 7.4 minutes in control group II (P = .032). At 96 hours postarrest, final overall performance categories (1, normal; 5, brain death) were better in group I. Six of 10 dogs achieved normality (overall performance category 1) in group I, as compared with none of 10 in group II (P = .004).

The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. The authors present two cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature reveals that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease.\r"

Using a simple mathematical model of the interacting population dynamics of HIV and its major host cell in the circulation (the CD4+ lymphocyte), predicted patterns of HIV plasma viraemia in the weeks following treatment with zidovudine are generated. These are in close agreement with observed patterns despite the fact that the model contains no mechanisms for the development of drug-resistant strains of virus. It is suggested that the patterns of viral abundance observed during the first 6 months after treatment may be the result of non-linearities in the interactions between HIV and CD4+ cells, and that it is only after the first post-treatment burst of viral production that drug resistance plays an important role.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to determine whether prolonged zidovudine therapy enhanced reactivity in two sensitive assays of T-cell function: the ability of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cells to form T-cell colonies and their capacity to express receptors for the growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2). Treated patients, studied over periods of 20-60 weeks, showed no improvement in colony formation at any time interval, even in plates supplemented with exogenous IL-2. However, mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes showed a significant increase in the capacity to express IL-2 receptors (CD25). This enhanced expression resulted primarily from activation of the CD8+ cell subset.\r"

Among HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia was the most common lesion [20.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.5-23.3%] and pseudomembranous candidiasis was the next most common (5.8%, 95% CI 4.1-7.5%). Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous candidiasis, angular cheilitis and Kaposi's sarcoma were significantly more common in patients with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of erythematous candidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma increased during the 3-year period. Careful oral examinations may identify infected patients and provide suggestive information concerning their immune status.\r"

Patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) had more BAL fluid lymphocytes, mainly comprising CD8+ cells, and patients with bacterial infection had more neutrophils than other patients. Neither of these changes were mirrored in peripheral blood. Seven patients who died after their acute episode of PCP had significantly higher BAL fluid neutrophils than 53 patients with PCP who survived (P = 0.002). There seems to be correlation between BAL fluid neutrophilia, PCP and concomitant bacterial infection since four out of seven patients with a fatal outcome had coinfection with bacteria, whereas only one patient with PCP and bacterial coinfection survived (P = 0.0007).\r"

Because of the importance of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II antigens in modulating the immune response, we examined the tissue expression of MHC molecules in relation to CNS damage and expression of viral antigens. By immunocytochemical staining we found that beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) expression is elevated in all cases with signs of viral encephalitis. beta 2M was expressed at high levels on endothelial cells, macrophages and possible oligodendroglia within regions of histopathology. In histologically normal regions elevated expression of beta 2M was noted only on endothelial cells. MHC class II expression was elevated only in the HIV encephalitis cases, and was restricted to macrophages/microglia and occasional endothelial cells. When compared with other viral encephalitides these findings suggest that the intra-CNS immune response to HIV is appropriate for viral presentation; however, the absence of responsive systemic T cells may lead to chronic viral infection.\r"

Two hundred and thirty-two subjects (193 men, 39 women; median age 32) participated; a response rate of 89%. Clients were long-term, frequent injectors. Lending used equipment at any time was reported by 55%, and borrowing by 52%. Of those who had shared needles and syringes during the last year, the majority had lent to, or borrowed from, one person only (53 and 55%, respectively). Younger clients (less than 29 years of age) reported more recent sharing than older clients (greater than 30 years of age). Five out of 211 (2.4%) samples tested for anti-HIV were positive. One hundred and eleven out of 199 (56%) samples were positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc). In this population of needle-exchange attenders there is no evidence of further spread of HIV, and a low prevalence of HIV infection appears to have been sustained. However, the high prevalence of anti-HBc provides evidence of previous risk behaviour and so constant vigilance is necessary if further viral spread is to be avoided. This study has established an acceptable method for the anonymous surveillance of current risk behaviour and salivary antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a drug-using population.\r"

Of the 452 (69%) women who took part in this research, 77% considered themselves as 'not at risk of carrying the AIDS virus', 11% as 'at risk' and 12% did not give a specific answer. The most important risk factors noted by the patient and the doctor were found to be the number of partners, the use of syringes and the non- or faulty use of condoms. Estimates of the risk of infection by physicians had a high correlation with those of the women, although there were wide differences between the opinions of the six doctors involved. In one case out of three the doctors were unable to decide whether or not their patient was at risk. The evident difficulties experienced by these physicians show an urgent need for the development of specific medical training programmes. The seroprevalence of 2.4% of HIV infection among the women studied, and 1.1% of those who consulted during the study period, confirm the importance of carrying out specific studies on women consulting in family planning centres.\r"

In the present study, macaques with clinical simian AIDS (SAIDS) infected with the immunosuppressive type-D retrovirus D/1/California had increased concentrations of CSF neopterin but not of biopterin beginning soon after seroconversion. Normal neopterin concentrations in the CSF were found in macaques with SAIDS-related complex as well as asymptomatic, viremic macaques. CSF biopterin, serum neopterin and serum biopterin concentrations of D/1/California-infected macaques were not different from the levels in control animals. The increase in CSF neopterin may reflect local inflammatory responses and paralleled previously documented changes in L-tryptophan metabolism in these macaques. However, the absence of macrophage infiltrates in the brain of the infected macaques suggests a non-macrophage source of both increased CSF neopterin and tryptophan metabolites in the SAIDS macaques.\r"

Of saliva specimens from HIV-infected people, six gave negative results on the Abbott and one on the Wellcome assays; all specimens from uninfected people were negative by both assays. Sensitivity for the Abbott assay was therefore 88.0% [95% confidence interval (Cl) 76.2-94.4%], an unacceptable level for screening purposes. Sensitivity for the Wellcome assay was 98% (95% Cl 89.5-99.6%), a more satisfactory level for population screening.

To analyse further the biological properties of these antibodies, we have purified them from the sera of six patients using affinity chromatography. We demonstrate that purified and concentrated anti-CD4 antibodies still cannot recognize CD4 either in its native conformation or after the binding of HIV gp120. They also cannot mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity on CD4+ or HIV-coated CD4+ cells. In one patient, however, we could detect a minor fraction of anti-CD4 antibodies directed to the V1V2 domains of CD4.\r"

We studied 238 female prostitutes working in 14 brothels and confirmed this high prevalence rate. Eighty-seven (36.5%) out of 238 prostitutes were found to be HIV-positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with IFA or Western blot confirmation. Logistic regressions found a significant association between HIV infection and frequency of sexual intercourse greater than 3 times per day [odds ratio (OR) = 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.47-5.41], sexual service charge less than 150 Baht (OR = 9.1, 95% CI = 2.9-33.3), and post sexual cleansing with water alone (OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.90-7.80).

The treatment of choice is a combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. We present here four patients with AIDS treated for toxoplasmic encephalitis who developed sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria. This complication was rapidly reversible with rehydration and urine alkalinization. Patients with AIDS treated with high doses of sulfadiazine should be adequately hydrated, and their urinary pH maintained above 7.5 to prevent sulfadiazine-induced crystalluria.\r"

  ".W": "The adequacy of treatment for syphilis has routinely been evaluated by the serological response, i.e. the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR). Since the description of AIDS and HIV aspects of both the natural history of syphilis and the response of Treponema pallidum to treatment have come under increased scrutiny. With concurrent epidemics of HIV and syphilis in New York City, a serological case-control study was done to determine whether HIV-infected individuals given treatment for primary or secondary syphilis have a modified serological response. All study participants had primary or secondary syphilis and paired specimens available for testing. Cases were defined as people who were HIV-positive and were compared with controls who were HIV-negative. HIV-infected patients with primary syphilis when compared with HIV-negative controls were less likely to have a fourfold or greater RPR decrease or seroreversion within 6 months of treatment [15 out of 28 versus 153 out of 210; odds ratio = 0.4, P less than 0.05]. Cases and controls with secondary syphilis had similar serological responses after treatment for syphilis. Although this study adds to the growing body of literature which suggests that HIV may alter the RPR response, prospective studies are needed to determine definitively whether HIV alters the serological response to therapy in patients with early syphilis.\r"

The MLD is a psychoacoustic measure of the sensitivity of the auditory system to subtle interaural difference cues of time and amplitude and relates to the ability of the listener to detect and to recognize signals in noisy backgrounds. In the otitis media with effusion group, MLDs were measured both before and 1 and 3 months after the placement of pressure equalization tubes. The MLDs were often abnormally small in the otitis media with effusion group before surgery, when hearing loss was present. Significantly, MLDs sometimes remained abnormally small after surgery (after normal hearing had returned). The postsurgery MLD was particularly likely to be abnormally reduced in subjects who had experienced asymmetric losses of hearing.\r"

Various methods have been attempted, but none enjoys uniform success. With advances in the field of microvascular surgery have come numerous options in replacing these defects. These procedures, however, require special surgical teams and are associated with an increase in operative time as well as morbidity at the donor site. An alternative method involves the use of mandibular reconstruction plates to bridge the defect between segments. This review focuses on 19 patients whose jaws were reconstructed in this fashion. Although not free of complications, mandibular plate reconstruction offers the advantages of (1) lack of donor site morbidity, (2) expediency, (3) excellent mandibular contour, and (4) the ability to reconstruct the condyle when necessary. The technique, results, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed.\r"

Review of 15 patients revealed that all had advanced disease (stage III and stage IV); 14 cases involved the tongue base, and one was on the posterior pharyngeal wall. By following the hyoepiglottic ligament, precise entry into the vallecula was routine. No injuries of vital neurovascular structures or compromised tumor margins were present; one tracheotomy was performed. Primary closure without the use of flaps was accomplished in 14 of 15 patients. No locoregional recurrences were found, with a median follow-up of 25 months. However, two patients died of another unrelated cancer, and two patients died of a myocardial infarction unrelated to their surgery. Suprahyoid pharyngotomy is a familiar approach often utilized during laryngectomy. In our experience, it provides excellent exposure of the oropharynx, can be combined with a transoral approach to avoid mandibulotomy without precluding this option, allows for simple reconstruction, and has a low complication rate.\r"

The sex distribution was equal. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 276 months, with a median of 79 months. The primary site of the tumor was the mandible in nine cases, maxilla and paranasal sinuses in six, skull in two, and orbit in one. Six of 18 patients were free of disease with greater than 5 years of follow-up. Four of the six received combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as their primary treatment. Of the five patients treated with surgery alone, four suffered recurrences, one of whom was salvaged with further surgery and chemotherapy. Five patients were treated initially without surgery. They received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy; all five developed local recurrence. We conclude that osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck is an aggressive tumor, prone to both local and distant failure. Based on our series and from published experience involving the extremities, osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck should be managed with multimodality therapy.\r"

The ratio of glottic to supraglottic tumors was 22.12:1 in men and 0.56:1 in women, a highly significant difference. Survival in glottic tumors was significantly better than in supraglottic tumors, but survival was not significantly better for women than it was for men. Glottic tumors were significantly more likely than were supraglottic tumors to be of low-grade malignancy for all subjects and for male subjects alone, but not for female subjects alone. Women were younger at time of diagnosis than were men, but not significantly so. Gender is an important factor in the genesis of laryngeal cancer.\r"

Actual changes in measured nasal tip projection were evaluated with respect to preoperative goals and specific procedures used to accomplish these goals in the nasal tip. Several useful observations are made from these data: (1) The most important components of nasal tip projection in the postsurgical nasal tip are the medial crura, their attachment to the caudal septum, and the presence of additional cartilaginous grafts placed between the medial crura or beneath the crural feet. (2) Actual nasal tip projection will decrease postoperatively, unless measures to increase the length and strength of the medial crural segment are taken (ie, McCollough-modified Goldman tip procedure, cartilage struts, plumping grafts, etc), regardless of the preoperative goal. (3) The double-dome unit procedure is effective in narrowing the wide or bulbous lobule but alone does not permanently increase nasal tip projection. (4) Conservative tip procedures, such as a complete strip, result in decreased nasal tip projection and should therefore be used in patients in whom retrodisplacement of the nasal tip is the intended result.\r"

Initially described in Japan, cases of HNL are being reported in the United States and other western countries with increasing frequency. Symptoms of HNL include tender cervical adenopathy, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Laboratory studies reveal leukopenia with relative granulocytopenia and lymphocytosis. Lymph node biopsy reveals areas with frank cellular necrosis, karyorrhexis, and absence of plasma cells. The histologic features of HNL are distinctive but can be confused with those of lymphoma. We describe two cases of HNL and present recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.\r"

We initially classified our patients into five groups as described in the publications of Moll and Wright. Thirty-seven per cent had oligoarthritis, 36% polyarthritis, 23% spondarthritis (sacroiliitis and/or spondylitis) and 4% had the mutilans form. The distal joint arthritis type did not exist as an entity and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints were affected in all groups. The spondarthritis form includes patients with exclusively axial manifestations and also those who in addition have peripheral arthritis (oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, DIP arthritis). Only 53% of our patients had nail involvement. We found an increase of IgA levels in patients with axial disease. This suggests a relationship between ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic spondylitis. The HLA-B17/Cw6 association increased in the oligoarticular form. The increase of antigen B17 correlated with the spondarthritic and oligoarthritis forms whereas Cw6 was more important in the oligoarthritis form. An increase of the HLA-B27/Cw1 association and the spondarthritic form was also found. Moreover, we detected a greater incidence of the HLA-B27 antigen in patients with bilateral sacroiliitis (85%) than in patients with unilateral sacroiliitis (22%). Our work revealed that PA is not a harmless disease; 57% of our patients had erosive arthritis while 19% had ARA class III or IV functional impairment.\r"

Sufficient data for analysis were obtained in 88 cases, of whom 36 had a final diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (19 seropositive, 17 seronegative) and 16 human parvovirus B19 arthropathy. Outcome was assessed by persistence of symptoms greater than 24 months and functional disability by Health Assessment Questionnaire. Sixty-two patients had persistent disease, with 26 showing some functional impairment (positive HAQ FDI). A number of presenting features were assessed for their ability to predict outcome at 5 years. Polyarticular onset of disease was associated with a poor prognosis but lacked both specificity and sensitivity. Certain laboratory tests at presentation, including positive rheumatoid factor and low serum sulphydryl levels, also indicated a poor outcome. Combining these serological abnormalities gave 100% specificity for detecting persistent, disabling disease but with rather low sensitivity. Thus, other test systems are required to increase further the successful prediction of clinical outcome in patients with early synovitis.\r"

Levels of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and activity of nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase (NTPP) were estimated in synovial fluid from 91 asymptomatic normal knees, including five with isolated CPPD crystal deposition (70 subjects; median age 47, range 22-83 years). In non-crystal fluids, PPi levels and NTPP activities were low (median, interquartile range: 9.5, 7.6-12.3 microM, and 1, 0.4-2 microM/30 min/mg protein, respectively: n = 50) and a generalized increase with age was not demonstrated. Higher values for PPi and NTPP in all five subjects with isolated CPPD deposition supports involvement of altered PPi metabolism, unrelated to ageing per se, in crystal formation. Presumed cartilage fragments were identified by morphological characteristics in 70% of normal fluids: metachromatic staining and electron microscopy, undertaken in a limited number, supported identification of such particles as cartilage. This finding supports dynamic turnover of healthy matrix, and questions the usefulness of identification, without quantification, cartilage fragments as a measure of cartilage damage.\r"

  ".W": "In both young and old human articular cartilage explants, TNF alpha induced a concentration-dependent, reversible suppression of the proteoglycan (PG) synthesis. Young cartilage was more sensitive to TNF alpha than old cartilage: 50% suppression of PG synthesis was reached at a TNF alpha concentration of 5 U/ml for young and 30 U/ml for old cartilage, whereas at 10(3) U/ml the PG synthesis of young cartilage was blocked and that of old cartilage suppressed by 80%. These inhibition levels of PG synthesis resulted in 25% PG depletion of the explants after 8 days of culture. The release of cartilage PG was not enhanced. TNF alpha induced no detectable amounts of IL-1 (less than 0.01 U) in young or old cartilage but did induce IL-6 production. The induced amounts of IL-6 were higher in young than in old cartilage but no dose-dependency was evident. Antibodies to neither IL-1 nor IL-6 had any influence on the TNF alpha-induced suppression of PG synthesis. The combination of TNF alpha and IL-1 led to an additive inhibition of PG synthesis which had no relationship to induced IL-6. TNF alpha was about 100-fold less active than IL-1.\r"

Oestrogen use of between 5 and 10 years is associated with a 50% reduction in risk of fracture. There is good evidence that in established osteoporosis, oestrogen prevents further bone loss and reduces the incidence of fractures. Oestrogen use leads to lasting skeletal benefits and will prevent bone loss at whatever age it is started. Prior to fracture there are no symptoms associated with osteoporosis and few patients will be diagnosed at a time when effective treatment could be instigated. It is apparent that the risk of developing osteoporosis cannot be deduced from clinical data alone and bone mineral measurements provide the single best test for future risk. Bone mass can be measured directly and there is no need for guess work. The most important potential application for oestrogen is in preventive therapy, and the efficient use of oestrogen in this situation depends upon the diagnosis of low bone mass. Who to treat remains the issue. For any age group the median value of bone density and a range of percentiles can be generated, thus facilitating therapeutic decisions.\r"

Most patients (76%) found benefit in wearing the collar. Pain was the symptom helped most (78%) whilst dizziness was helped least (40%). Problems with the collars were common, many being too hot (69%) and uncomfortable (48%). A third had difficulty putting the collar on. Despite these problems, compliance was good with 19 patients discontinuing collars for reasons other than recovery or medical advice.

Rheumatoid arthritis and polyarthritis accounted for 43% of new referrals and 75% of follow-up patients. For these categories, 6.5 follow-up patients were seen for each new referral, but this ratio varied from 3.7 to 11.7. Other diagnoses also had variable patterns of follow-up but because they represented only a small proportion they were less relevant to overall service provision and resource consumption.

We found no demonstrable effect on the clinical or skeletal progression of the disorder using sensitive methods of measuring the response to treatment.

In this study plasma IL-1 alpha was measured by radioimmunoassay in patients with RA and in healthy controls. Plasma levels were compared with conventional measures of disease activity. The mean levels in the two groups were not significantly different and, within the patient group (n = 53), the only significant cross-sectional correlation was between plasma IL-1 alpha and ESR. In longitudinal studies, some individual patients had plasma IL-1 alpha levels that correlated with different measures of disease activity. We conclude that while IL-1 alpha may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of RA, its measurement in plasma seems to offer little of clinical value.\r"

The advantages of using a guiding catheter for renal angioplasty are analogous to the benefits obtained with a coronary angioplasty guiding catheter used in coronary angioplasty. The guiding catheter provides back-up support to cross lesions and allows selective contrast visualization of the lesion before, during, and after dilation. It is also possible, when using a guiding catheter, to measure pressure gradients across lesions without having to recross the lesion which may help to ensure that adequate dilation of the stenosis has been accomplished.\r"

  ".W": "To determine adequate and effective balloon diameters of the Inoue balloon catheter, we reviewed clinical results and characteristics of the Inoue balloon catheter, especially the relationship between the intra-balloon pressure and the balloon diameter, experimentally and clinically, in 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). Mitral valve area increased from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 cm2 in all patients after PTMC. Based on balloon diameter settings, mitral valve area increased from 1.3 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 cm2 in patients treated with a balloon setting greater than 26 mm in diameter, from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm2 in patients with a balloon setting at 26 mm in diameter, and from 1.1 +/- 0.4 to 1.7 +/- 0.4 cm2 in those treated with a balloon setting less than 26 mm in diameter, with an increase in mitral valve area of 1.0 +/- 0.6, 0.9 +/- 0.4, and 0.7 +/- 0.2 cm2, respectively. There was a significant difference between the increase in mitral valve area at a setting of 26 mm in diameter and that observed at a setting less than 26 mm in diameter. We next investigated differences between balloon diameter settings and actual balloon diameters measured from cineangiograms at maximum balloon inflation. The ratio of actual balloon diameter to a setting diameter of less than 26 mm was smaller than that of 26 mm. To evaluate the reason for the difference, we investigated the relationship between intra-balloon pressure and balloon diameter. In the prototype Inoue balloon catheter, intra-balloon pressure increases from 1.0 kg/cm2 at 20 mm in diameter to 2.2 kg/cm2 at 30 mm in diameter at atmospheric pressure. In conclusion, the increase in mitral valve area was inadequate when the balloon was less than 26 mm in diameter because of inadequate intra-balloon pressure. We, therefore, recommend a balloon size set above 26 mm to obtain adequate intra-balloon pressure when using the Inoue balloon catheter.\r"

Three (4%) patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery due to abrupt vessel closure during the angioplasty procedure, with one hospital death (1.4%).

This fact has contributed to a higher restenosis rate for this group of patients. We were able to obtain a satisfactory dilatation result in an oversized right coronary artery with a shepherd's crook configuration and eccentric anatomy at the origin using two balloon-on-a-wire systems and an Amplatz type guiding catheter. Although such favorable dilatation of an oversized artery using this \"hugging balloon technique\" can be expected, issues do exist such as difficult maneuverability and estimation of the balloon size obtained through simultaneous dual balloon inflation wherein size does not simply equal the sum of the two balloon catheters. It is hoped that there will be further improvements of the technique and development of new systems. At this time, however, it is felt that this is the most effective and reasonable strategy to achieve a high chance of success in oversized vessel lesions.\r"

Double balloon dilatation reduced the transmitral gradient from 17.36 +/- 3.54 to 5.52 +/- 0.89 (P less than 0.025) and transtricuspid gradient from 12.65 +/- 2.67 to 3.67 +/- 0.95 (P less than 0.025). Mitral and tricuspid valve area increased from 0.73 +/- 0.20 to 2.57 +/- 0.67 (P less than 0.005) and from 0.77 +/- 0.24 to 2.67 +/- 0.24 cm2 (P less than 0.005), respectively. The procedures were well tolerated, with no significant increase in valvular regurgitation or left to right shunt across the atrial septum. The excellent symptomatic and haemodynamic benefits are sustained at 3-24 months follow-up. It is concluded that combined dilatation of stenotic valves by double balloon technique can emerge as an alternative to surgery in selected patients with polyvalvar rheumatic heart disease.\r"

The values of EF were obtained from digital subtraction ventriculograms of the first cardiac cycle after completion of the injection of the contrast medium by the videodensitometric technique and were compared with those obtained from conventional ventriculograms by the area-length method in the same patients. There was a close correlation between the densitometric EF from digital subtraction ventriculograms and the volumetric EF from conventional ventriculograms (r = 0.78). Densitometric EF measured in the 30 degree right anterior oblique projection highly correlated with densitometric EF measured in the 60 degree left anterior projection (r = 0.98). These data suggest that this densitometric technique is available in any projection and is a simple procedure for the accurate measurement of left ventricular EF.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary retention following total hip and knee arthroplasty is a common problem frequently necessitating either prolonged urethral catheter drainage or intermittent catheterization. The direct relationship of urinary tract instrumentations, procedures, and infections to deep sepsis in total hip replacements is well documented. Pharmacologic therapy to stimulate voiding or augment bladder emptying is thus theoretically preferable to the use of catheterization. Prasozin hydrochloride, an alpha blocker, relaxes the smooth musculature of the posterior urethra and prostrate and has been used to treat urinary obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. A prospective study in 60 male patients showed a statistically significant decrease in postoperative urinary retention with the perioperative administration of prazosin (p less than 0.01). A higher incidence of urinary tract infection was seen in patients who developed urinary retention (3% versus 20%) (p less than 0.01). Uroflowmetry parameters were not predictive of the patient at risk for retention and were unaltered with the administration of prazosin. Prazosin can be an effective adjunct in the prophylaxis of postoperative urinary tract infections and may decrease the potential risk for total joint sepsis.\r"

Males received aspirin 650 mg po bid and females low-dose warfarin daily to maintain the prothrombin time at 15 to 16 seconds for pharmacologic prophylaxis against TED. Thirty-four patients had EA and 38 GA for their primary TKA. Contrast venography and ventilation-perfusion scanning were performed on the sixth, seventh, and eighth postoperative days, and these were interpreted in a blinded fashion. The mean age of the 45 males and 27 females was 64 years (range, 42-84 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to hematocrit, operative time, blood loss, number of units transfused, or hospital stay. Twelve of the 34 patients (35%) receiving an EA and 10 of the 38 patients (26%) receiving GA developed TED, an overall incidence of 31% (p greater than 0.05) Fifty-three percent of the clots were located in the popliteal vein above the trifurcation or more proximal. However, the incidence of proximal vein thrombosis was significantly less in patients receiving an EA (46%) rather than a GA (64%). The incidence and distribution of clots was not affected by the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis, gender, or use of methylmethacrylate. Ten percent of the patients had a positive scan by strict criteria and were thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients with a femoral vein clot, the incidence of PE was 67%. One bleeding complication occurred in a patient who took double the appropriate warfarin dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To date, 33 PCA inserts have been forwarded to the authors' labs. Of these 33, 52% showed severe delamination within four years of implantation. Visual, structural, and mechanical analyses were conducted and data compared on the heat-pressed PCA type and the common machined inserts. Twenty inserts of the two different types were examined. Visual data using polarized light microscopy showed the presence of a surface layer separated from the middle region of the heat-pressed inserts by a line of demarcation 250-580 microns beneath the articulating surface. This anomaly was not observed in machined inserts. Structural analysis showed the new heat-pressed inserts had increased crystallinity in the surface layer when compared to new machined inserts. The retrieved heat-pressed inserts showed increased crystallinity in the surface and middle regions. There was a slight increase in surface crystallinity in the retrieved machined inserts. Microhardness data showed that there was an increased hardness associated with the crystallinity seen on the heat-pressed inserts. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of early delamination and surface failure in heat-pressed inserts.\r"

Since Albright's time, more sensitive methods of assessing bone density have replaced conventional roentgenograms. Some large scale trials of estrogen have indicated increased bone density and fewer fractures. Unopposed estrogen increases risk of endometrial cancer and decreases mortality from other cancers, myocardial infarction, stroke, and osteoporosis. Trials of calcitonin, diphosphonates, fluoride, vitamin D, and high calcium intake have not proved more effective than estrogen.\r"

Six patients presented with a Frankel B paralysis, six with a Frankel C paralysis, and two with grade D paralysis. The neurologic symptoms lasted between one day and six weeks before surgery. Twelve patients had anterolateral decompression. Two of the 12 patients had a second stage posterior stabilization. Two patients were deemed inoperable. All surviving patients were managed by parenteral antibiotics for three to six weeks followed by enteral route for a total of three to six months.

Since then, 44 patients with cementless acetabular components and 35 patients with cementless femoral components have been followed for a minimum of 24 months and an average of 37 months. Harris hip scores averaged 90.5 at most recent follow-up intervals. No reoperations were necessary for failures of fixation or change in position of the acetabular component. Ominous roentgenographic signs such as progressive bead shedding, progressive radiolucencies, or progressive component migration have not occurred. Two femoral component revisions have been necessary: one for intractable pain and one for pain and roentgenographic loosening. Although thigh pain has been prevalent (20%), all patients have been accommodated and have retained stable hip scores. Progressive radiolucencies and progressive implant subsidence have been rare occurrences. The authors continue to use the cementless acetabular component in all cases of total hip arthroplasty in which initial stability can be obtained. It is their preference to cement the femoral component in patients over 65 or when initial stability cannot be achieved.\r"

These disorders each have a common pathologic course that includes rotator cuff tendinitis (RCT), and, if untreated, may proceed to cuff rupture. RCT has at least two distinct etiologies. Primary impingement of the supraspinatus tendon on the coracoacromial arch is responsible in the majority of nonathletic cases. Overhead movements in sports are prone to developing secondary mechanical impingement because of an instability pattern that is common in this population. Information from this review and clinical practice permits differentiation of the two distinct etiologies of RCT which is important in treatment planning. Much work still needs to be done in defining the microscopic pathology of RCT.\r"

This series of 148 fractures in 116 scapulae (113 patients) appears to be the largest ever reported and the only one with a follow-up study of a significant group (24 patients). Significant disability was found in patients with displaced scapular spine and neck fractures: (1) pain at rest in 50%-100%, (2) weakness with exertion in 40%-60%, and (3) pain with exertion in 20%-66%. Based on these findings, the indications for operative management should be expanded to include displaced scapular neck and spine fractures. Using extensile exposure through a posterior Judet incision, rigid internal fixation, and early motion, results in eight cases were excellent. All patients recovered at least 85 degrees of glenohumeral abduction, normal scapulothoracic motion, and none had resting pain, night pain, or pain with abduction.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from eight shoulder muscles in six patients using surface and intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Recordings were made from the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, pectoralis major (sternoclavicular part), the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the deltoid, and the latissimus dorsi. The EMG signal was low-pass filtered, full-wave rectified, and time-average. Normalization of the EMG allowed interindividual and intraindividual comparisons. During abduction and flexion, muscle activity in the anterior and middle parts of the deltoid was significantly decreased in the patients, and during internal rotation activity in the subscapularis was increased. As in healthy subjects, patients showed simultaneous activity in both those muscles producing the movement and in the antagonistic muscles. The altered muscle activity observed in patients with generalized joint laxity provides (1) a basis for understanding the mechanism of their shoulder instability and (2) the rationale for a physical training program for these patients.\r"

Simple decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, subcutaneous transposition, intramuscular transposition, and submuscular transposition all have their advocates. The results of the surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome are related to the severity of the compressive neuropathy at the time of diagnosis and to the adequate decompression of the nerve at all sites of potential compression at the time of surgical treatment. Fourteen patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated because of persistent pain, paresthesia, numbness, and motor weakness. All patients had documented persistent compression of the ulnar nerve on clinical and electromyographic evaluation. The indication for repeat surgical exploration in all patients was unremitting pain despite nonoperative treatment. All patients had been treated by neurolysis and submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve as described by Learmonth. The causes of continued pain after initial surgery included retention of the medial intermuscular septum, dense perineural fibrosis of the nerve after intramuscular and subcutaneous transposition, adhesions of the nerve to the medial epicondylectomy site, and recurrent subluxation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle after subcutaneous transposition. Revision surgery was found to be highly successful for relief of pain and paresthesias; however, the recovery of motor function and return of sensibility were variable and unpredictable.\r"

Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging.

Three years postoperatively, the total subsidence averaged 2.44 mm and the internal rotation was 7.4 degrees. The rate of subsidence decreased between the observation periods, whereas the rate of rotation, after an initial significant decrease, became almost constant. One patient, who was a clinical failure and required revision arthroplasty, had a significantly higher rate of migration after six months. The pattern of subsidence in the absence of pain might be the normal reaction of bone to an uncemented prosthesis, but the continuing rotation suggests the potential for failure of the arthroplasty. The type of analysis made possible in RSA may allow early prediction of the success of arthroplasties and significantly speed the design cycle for arthroplasty components.\r"

Preoperatively, 46% of patients attributed significant sexual difficulties to their hip disease, whereas only 1% felt that their hips remained a significant source of problems postsurgery. The majority (55%) of patients were able to resume intercourse one to two months postoperation. Male patients were statistically more likely to resume intercourse sooner than their female counterparts. Patients were also questioned about which coital positions they found comfortable after arthroplasty. The supine position (patient on bottom) was the most preferred. The next most comfortable position for males was prone (patient on top), yet for female it was sidelying on the nonoperative hip. In addition, 89% of patients desired more information regarding sexual function postarthroplasty, preferably in the form of a booklet. Therefore, a booklet was written specifically for postoperative patients and their sexual partners.\r"

The advantages and disadvantages of sesamoidectomy are influenced by surgical technique. Care in handling the medial and lateral hallucal nerves is essential. Removal of both the medial and lateral sesamoids invariably leads to an intractable clawtoe deformity and is absolutely contraindicated.\r"

Twelve patients had a significant increase in tissue pressure with values greater than 30 mmHg because of primary fracture hematoma or interstitial fluid accumulation. This increase in pressure persisted for three to five days after trauma, so that ischemic damage to the short plantar foot muscles had to be suspected. Plantar muscle scarring and claw-toe formation were observed in seven patients with a total of 11 fractures during a mean observation period of 18 months. The plantar aponeurosis, which forms the constricting fascial envelope of the plantar muscles, is the anatomic structure responsible for the compartment syndrome that may develop after calcaneal fracture. Therefore, to avoid functional deficit, plantar compartmental pressures should be regularly measured after calcaneal fracture. Significantly increased plantar tissue pressure greater than 30 mmHg should be relieved by longitudinal incision of the plantar aponeurosis, preferably by a plantar incision as soon as the diagnosis is made.\r"

The osteoclasts stained intensely for tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase, an enzyme that is specific for osteoclasts.

The latter were evaluated by means of leukoagglutination and the indirect migration inhibition assay, respectively. Untreated recipients of syngeneic rib chondrocytes and untreated recipients of whole syngeneic and allogeneic rib cartilage served as controls. Transplanted syngenic rib chondrocytes formed cartilaginous nodules similar to rib cartilage in situ. These nodules contained hypertrophied chondrocytes, but neither physiologic resorption by vascularized connective tissue nor bone formation occurred after an observation period of longer than six weeks. Transplantation of allogeneic chondrocytes resulted in development of humoral and cellular antigraft immunity, and the formed cartilage was destroyed by infiltrating immune cells. Immunosuppression by ATS-PCH resulted in inhibition of graft destruction and a marked decrease of specific humoral antigraft immunity. Cellular antigraft immunity did not occur. Moreover, neither the histologic appearance of the cartilaginous nodules nor the results of immunologic response evaluations in the ATS-PCH-treated group differed from those in untreated whole allogeneic cartilage recipients. Treatment with Cy-A did not significantly improve survival cartilage formed by allogeneic chondrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "When porous calcium phosphate ceramic is combined with marrow cells and grafted either heterotopically or orthotopically, bone forms inside the pores on the surface of the ceramic beginning at three weeks after implantation. The question remains as to whether the newly formed bone is derived from host or donor cells. To study the origin of bone cells formed in these composite grafts of marrow cells and ceramic, quail marrow cells from long bones were introduced into ceramics and the composites were implanted into subcutaneous pouches of immunologically nonreactive athymic nude mice. The ceramics were recovered at two to 84 days following surgery, fixed, decalcified, embedded, sectioned, and examined for the location of a quail-specific nucleolar marker and the binding of a specific antiserum against quail cells. Our observations indicate that ceramic-associated osteogenesis is a biphasic phenomenon: an early phase, the first three to four weeks after implantation, in which donor cells are largely responsible for the observed osteogenesis, and a second phase, eight to 12 weeks postsurgery, in which host cell actions predominate. During the second stage, the ceramic pores begin to show the formation of marrow of host origin, and the mesenchymal marrow component appears to be osteogenic because the bone formed during this late postgrafting stage contains osteocytes of host and donor origin. The second phase therefore results in chimeric bone composed of quail and mouse. These studies clearly document the donor origin of the initial bone formation and indicate that marrow contains progenitor cells capable of forming de novo bone.\r"

To investigate bone differentiation by induction in primates, diaphyseal bone was harvested from ten male baboons and chemosterilized to obtain autolyzed, antigen-extracted allogeneic (AAA) bone containing the bone morphogenetic protein essential for osteoinduction. A total of 96 AAA bone diaphyseal cylinders were implanted intramuscularly in 24 adult male baboons and harvested at three, six, and nine months. Histologic analysis showed that the matrix had undergone considerable resorption, particularly at six and nine months. Seventy-three implants showed variable amounts of newly formed bone at the internal and external surfaces of the chemosterilized matrix. Numerous specimens showed florid bone formation, and newly formed woven bone persisted in association with the matrix for as long as nine months. Coating the AAA bone matrix with an allogeneic fibrin-fibronectin protein concentrate prepared from fresh-frozen baboon plasma did not significantly increase the amount of induced bone. Bone formation was confirmed by intravital double tetracycline labeling of the mineralization fronts. The unequivocal demonstration of bone formation by induction in a large series of adult nonhuman primates provides evidence that long-lived higher vertebrates retain the bone-inductive proteins in the extracellular matrix of bone and the crucial set of responding mesenchymal cells capable of transformation and differentiation into osteoblastic cell lines.\r"

Three dogs regained a normal gait, and their grafts sustained breaking loads that were 25%, 41%, and 59% of controls. Partial or complete graft failure occurred in the other five dogs at some point in the study. Four had intraligamentous rupture and one had an avulsion fracture of the femoral attachment site. Joint-fluid cytology was normal in all eight dogs. Histologic examination showed persistent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Eventually the allograft cores were incorporated in the host bed. Hyperplasia and fibrosis of the synovial membrane were diffuse and persisted as focal accumulations of mononuclear inflammatory cells.\r"

Forty-two patients (47 hips) were followed with clinical examination and roentgenographs, three (four hips) by telephone interview, four (four hips) were deceased, and one (one hip) was lost to follow-up evaluation. The diagnoses included osteoarthritis (30 hips), avascular necrosis (11 hips), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (two hips), and degenerative joint disease secondary to childhood hip disorder (four hips). Of 47 hips, 34 were graded excellent, seven good, three fair, and three poor using the Harris hip score. The incidence of thigh pain was 19% at one year, but only 6% at final follow-up evaluation. Limp persisted in 19% of the patients. Of the three patients with four hips contacted by telephone, two had slight pain and two had no pain. The roentgenographic results found an alarming 38% incidence of varus shift of the components, relative to their preoperative position. The presence of a varus shift did not adversely affect the clinical results. Early experience with the Tri-Lock femoral component shows results comparable to those reported in the literature. The high incidence of femoral component shift, presumably because of geometry of the stem is of concern. Longer follow-up evaluation will be necessary to determine the fate of these uncemented THA operations.\r"

These subsided components were implanted onto tibiae with an average of 8 degrees +/- 2 degrees difference between the preoperative, anatomic posterior slope and their postoperative posterior slope. The remaining 23 components, without subsidence, were implanted onto tibiae cut within 2 degrees +/- 2 degrees of their anatomic slope. To help understand these clinical observations, a laboratory study was performed to compare the load carrying capacity and the stiffness of tibial subchondral bone following two types of tibial cuts: one made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia and the other made parallel to the articular surface of the tibia. Mock tibial baseplates mounted on paired cadaver tibiae were loaded in compression and force displacement curves were recorded. Tibiae cut parallel to the surface exhibited 40% greater load carrying capacity and 70% greater stiffness than the paired tibiae cut perpendicular to the long axis. The biomechanical data of this study indicated that cutting the tibia perpendicular to the long axis results in weaker bone that may be inadequate to support a tibial component. This may explain the higher incidence of clinical subsidence if the tibial cut is not made approximately parallel to the anatomic slope.\r"

Two hundred consecutive primary total knees were implanted between October 18, 1985 and January 19, 1988 and were followed prospectively. One hundred ninety-two were implanted without cement. Clinical evaluation demonstrates good or excellent results in 96%, including a mean range of motion of 122 at two to four years after arthroplasty. Routine fluoroscopic spot roentgenograms have shown no complete radiolucency in this series of patients. Bone ingrowth was predictable if morselized autograft bone was interposed between implant and host bone. Implant retrievals demonstrated uniform bone ingrowth into the porous coating, increasing to 40% of the pore volume in the tibial tray at 27 months. Restoration of the normal kinematics appears to minimize the bone-implant stress permitting bone ingrowth fixation. The results of primary cementless TKA in this series is comparable to cemented TKA with the advantage of conserving bone stock.\r"

Forty-nine patients were excluded. When fully ambulatory, the presence or absence of DVT was diagnosed by ascending venography (90% of patients), nuclear venography, venous dopplers, or impedence plethysmography. The two groups were similar in average age (64 years), indication for arthroplasty (pain because of arthritis in 90%), gender (98% male), and average number of risk factors (2.4). Twenty-five percent of patients on coumadin and 25% of patients on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) developed DVT. IPC was more effective than coumadin following primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (16% versus 24% incidence DVT); coumadin was more effective than IPC following primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) (19% versus 32% incidence of DVT). DVT developed in 36% of patients following revision arthroplasty. Seventy-five percent of all thrombi were proximal. Both IPC and coumadin were found to be safe; there was no increased perioperative bleeding in the coumadin group. Of three postoperative deaths, one was possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE).\r"

  ".W": "Over a two-year period, 112 consecutive primary total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed according to a standard protocol and were evaluated to determine the effects of intraoperative tourniquet deflation, suction drainage, and immediate continuous passive motion (CPM) on blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. It has been reported that these measures lead to increased morbidity following TKA. The tourniquet was deflated before closure, hemostasis was obtained, and two suction drains were placed for 24 to 48 hours. CPM was started immediately, and continued for a mean of seven days. Serial hematocrits (Hct) were obtained. Mean age of the 64 males and 48 females was 65 years. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 86% and rheumatoid arthritis in 14%. Seventy-three percent of the prostheses were cemented and 27% were uncemented. The mean tourniquet time was 104 minutes and the mean length of surgery was 140 minutes. Blood loss measured at surgery averaged 222 ml. Total calculated blood loss averaged 794 ml, but was higher for patients with a cemented versus uncemented prosthesis (p less than .05), and males versus females (p less than .005). It was not related to diagnosis, tourniquet time, or length of surgery. Of the 38% of patients requiring a transfusion (mean, 2.2 units), there was not a significantly greater drop in Hct (from 36.6 to 26.5; change, 10.1) when compared to patients not receiving a transfusion (from 43.1 to 32.5; change, 10.6). Therefore, the need for transfusion was related to preoperative Hct and not the intraoperative or postoperative blood loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of the T3, T4, TSH, and TRH tests were normal in all patients; cardiac valves and ventricular and atrial sizes (left atrium less than 40 mm) were within the normal limits; also normal were LVEDP (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) and EF (greater than 0.50). Histologic findings were abnormal in all cases, with three patients showing cardiomyopathic changes, three other patients showing active myocarditis (lymphocytic in two and eosinophilic in one), and eight patients with nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis or both. Steroids (prednisone; 50 mg/m2 of body surface area daily) used in addition to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with eosinophilic and lymphocytic active myocarditis were able to cause reversion to sinus rhythm, while the other patients continued to have AF. This study documents that occult myocardial diseases (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis) can underlie \"primary\" AF. The addition of steroids to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with refractory AF and histologic evidence of active myocarditis seems to be useful in controlling the arrhythmia.\r"

The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation. In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC. The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent. This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty. Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery.\r"

In a second period, terbutaline 0.5 mg was inhaled similarly but without PEP, and in a third period placebo spray was inhaled with PEP. Treatments were given three times daily. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured before and after each inhalation and symptom scores for dyspnea, cough, and mucus production were noted in a diary. All treatments increased PEF significantly (p less than 0.0001). The mean increase was 32 L/min during treatment with terbutaline and PEP. This was greater than the increase of 25 L/min during terbutaline treatment (p = 0.005). The increase in PEF during terbutaline treatment was significantly higher than the achieved 18 L/min during PEP (p = 0.026).

It utilizes a knowledge representation scheme to capture relevant clinical knowledge into structures about specific objects (jobs, diseases, etc) and pairwise relations between objects. Quantifiers describe both the closeness of association and risk, as well as the degree of belief in the validity of a fact. An independent inference engine utilizes the knowledge, combining likelihoods and uncertainties to achieve estimates of likelihood factors for specific paths from work to illness. The system creates a series of \"paths,\" linking work activities to disease outcomes. One path links a single period of work to a single possible disease outcome. In a preliminary trial, the number of \"paths\" from job to possible disease averaged 18 per subject in a general population and averaged 25 per subject in an asthmatic population. Artificial intelligence methods hold promise in the future to facilitate diagnosis in pulmonary and occupational medicine.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if transesophageal echocardiography provides better visualization of valvular vegetations than transthoracic echocardiography, we used both methods to evaluate 24 consecutive patients (mean age, 54 years; 15 female patients and nine male patients) referred for symptoms suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Ten of the 24 patients had one or more valvular prostheses. Echocardiograms were classified as positive or negative based on visualization of valvular vegetations or abscesses. Of ten patients with a final diagnosis of infectious endocarditis on extended follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography was positive in five patients. Transesophageal echocardiography not only yielded abnormal findings in all ten of these patients, but also revealed additional information in four of the five patients with abnormal transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. Among the 14 patients who, on subsequent follow-up, were found not to have infectious endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiography was normal in 13 and falsely abnormal in one. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infectious endocarditis in any of these patients. The ten patients who were determined to have infectious endocarditis all had positive blood cultures and no alternative cause for their clinical presentation; in seven patients in this group who underwent operative or postmortem evaluation, infectious endocarditis was confirmed. All patients without infectious endocarditis were demonstrated to have other causes for their clinical presentation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly valuable test in the work-up of patients with suspected infectious endocarditis, especially those patients with inconclusive or normal transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography may be of benefit to patients with previously documented infectious endocarditis and a complicated clinical course in whom additional cardiac lesions are suspected but not demonstrated by transthoracic echocardiography.\r"

Comparison of values obtained in the 80 degrees upright tilt position with those obtained in the standard supine position revealed significant decreases in early diastolic flow velocity (peak E) (-25 +/- 3 percent; p less than 0.001), late diastolic flow velocity (peak A) (-9 +/- 3 percent; p less than 0.01), and the ratio of early to late flow velocities (E/A ratio) (-17 +/- 4 percent; significant increases in deceleration time (+55 +/- 10 percent; p less than 0.001) and isovolumic relaxation time (+38 +/- 4 percent; p less than 0.001). Comparison of values obtained with supine isometric exercise with those obtained during the preceding supine resting state revealed significant decreases in peak E (-12 +/- 3 percent; p less than 0.001) and the E/A ratio (-21 +/- 4 percent; p less than 0.001) and significant increases in peak A (+15 +/- 4 percent; p less than 0.001) and isovolumic relaxation time (+16 +/- 3 percent; p less than 0.001). The response of Doppler-derived measurements of diastolic function to postural changes and isometric exercise is complex and multifactorial. Interpretation of these measurements must take into account changes in loading conditions.\r"

Measurements for the other two groups (20 patients each) were taken with one or another, the two leaks randomly alternated with no leak. Pimax measurements obtained with Ringqvist's leak were 17 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 22 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with no leak. Pemax measurements performed with Ringqvist's leak in place were 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those obtained with no leak. The comparison between Clausen's leak and no leak showed no statistically significant difference. We conclude that whenever the effect of pressure generated in the mouth is to be avoided in the measurement of respiratory Pmax, a leak of the size proposed by Ringqvist is to be preferred.\r"

  ".W": "In sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), vigilance impairment is typically associated with highly disrupted sleep, but recently, nocturnal hypoxemia has also been identified as a second pathogenetic factor in patients with a high degree of desaturation. However, although sleep disruption has been demonstrated to play a role in both the propensity to fall asleep and the capacity to stay awake, the role of nocturnal hypoxemia has been implicated only in the latter. In the present study, both sleep disruption and nocturnal hypoxemia were assessed in 20 moderately to severely apneic patients. During the day, vigilance was assessed both by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), as a measure of the propensity to fall asleep, and by the four-choice reaction time test (FCRTT), as a measure of the capacity to stay awake in a performance task. Severity of nocturnal hypoxemia was found to predict performance on the MSLT, as well as on the FCRTT, but sleep disruption was found to predict performance only on the FCRTT. These results suggest that in moderately to severely affected SAS patients, nocturnal hypoxemia may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of vigilance impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Bedside estimation of the height at which the internal jugular veins collapse, referenced to a standard hemodynamic location, theoretically reflects central venous pressure. This method has never been demonstrated as accurate when compared to invasive CVP measurements because of the great clinical skills and time required to visually identify the internal jugular venous waveform. Since the principles of the bedside method are sound, we utilized them in conjunction with the neck inductive plethysmograph, a device which has the capability of recording internal jugular venous and carotid arterial waveforms. The respiratory distortion of these vascular waveforms was eliminated by employing a digital bandpass filter, making it easy to identify the venous and arterial waveforms on the videoscreen of a personal computer. The upper torso was positioned while observing the videoscreen until the vascular waveform was seen as a mixed arteriovenous waveform, signifying intermittent internal jugular venous collapse. The height of the internal jugular vein above the phlebostatic axis was obtained by external measurement and recorded as CVPni in cm H2O. In 43 patients, 86 percent of CVPni (NIP) values fell within 20 percent CVPi (invasive catheter measurements) over a range of CVP from 0 to 19 cm H2O. In an additional seven patients, CVPi was greater than the height that the upper torso could be elevated and an arterial waveform could not be obtained. Here, CVPni was recorded as the value at least exceeding the value measured. In two other patients, obstruction of an internal jugular vein gave spuriously low values of CVPni. Our study indicates that this new neck inductive plethysmographic method is accurate compared to invasive catheter measurements of CVP and should serve as a safe, noninvasive alternative in situations where such measurements are required.\r"

  ".W": "In cardiac surgery, topical iced saline solution slush has become an important adjunct in maintaining myocardial hypothermia during cardioplegic arrest. One complication of this technique is phrenic nerve injury (PNI). In an attempt to reduce the incidence of PNI, a prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of phrenic nerve insulation on PNI during cardiac surgery. Seventy-six consecutive patients who underwent coronary revascularization constituted the control group (CG) and were compared with 76 patients who underwent a similar procedure with the addition of phrenic nerve insulation. In the intervention group (IG), a foam insulation pad was placed between the heart and the pericardium in an effort to reduce exposure of the phrenic nerve to iced saline solution slush. There was no difference in major demographic descriptors or operative variables between the CG and the IG, except that the internal mammary artery was used more frequently in the IG (64 percent vs 36 percent, p = 0.0006). The in-hospital mortality was similar between the groups (CG, 0.0 percent; IG, 1.3 percent; p = 1.0); however, the incidence of roentgenographically diagnosed PNI was much greater in the CG (14/76 patients [18 percent] vs 0/76 patients [0 percent]; p = 0.0006). Patients with and without PNI were similar with regard to age, gender, aortic cross clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and number of grafts (p greater than 0.05). All unilateral PNI occurred on the left. Three patients with bilateral PNI required tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality was similar for patients with and without PNI (0 percent vs 0.7 percent), but mean postoperative hospital stay for patients with clinically diagnosed PNI was longer than for those without PNI (32 vs 11 days, p = 0.04). This prospective study demonstrates that the incidence of PNI can be significantly reduced by the routine use of phrenic nerve insulation.\r"

Twenty-four patients required steroid treatment during the study period. The proportion of treated patients was not significantly higher in the group presenting a BAL lymphocyte count less than or equal to 30 percent at diagnosis than in the group with fewer lymphocytes (31.9 and 17.7 percent of total group respectively, p = 0.10). No significant change in TLC, FRC, FVC, FEV1 or DLCO was found at follow-up between the groups with or without an initial high lymphocyte count. In the treated group, BAL lymphocyte percent weakly correlated with the improvement of FEV1 and FVC while on steroid treatment (mean duration: 3.5 months): r = 0.41, p = 0.031 and r = 0.36, p = 0.05 respectively; no correlation was found with lung volumes and DCO. We conclude that BAL lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis is not a helpful predictor of lung function deterioration in recently diagnosed sarcoidosis and is not very useful in predicting response to treatment.\r"

Epithelial cells, including ciliated cells, goblet cells, and fragments of desquamated epithelium, were easily identified after preparation by cytocentrifugation and staining with a modified Giemsa stain. Quantification of the columnar cell types revealed that those with chronic bronchitis and asymptomatic smokers have increased goblet cells as a percentage of the total columnar epithelial cells (chronic bronchitics 36 +/- 2 percent, asymptomatic smokers 22 +/- 2 percent) compared with normal subjects (9 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.001, ANOVA). Significantly, the goblet cell percentage was strongly correlated with other measures of bronchitis and measures of airflow obstruction such as the bronchitis index, a visually derived score at bronchoscopy of airway inflammation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001), the percent neutrophils in the first infused aliquots (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05), and the FEV1 percent (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001). Thus, bronchoalveolar lavage is capable of providing sufficient bronchial epithelial cells for analysis, and the changes seen in the spectrum of columnar epithelial cells may reflect important underlying pathologic changes.\r"

One hundred consecutive patients were studied prospectively. Twenty-nine patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria defined in this study (seven with and 22 without PE). The uFPA concentration was significantly higher in patients with than without PE (41.1 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mg of creatinine, p less than 0.0001). In all patients with PE, the uFPA levels were higher than threshold value derived by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean uFPA concentration of patients without PE. In patients without PE, the V/Q scan was negative in 16, the uFPA test was negative in 18, and at least one of the tests was negative in 21. These preliminary data suggest that a negative uFPA test may be helpful in excluding PE and that uFPA in combination with V/Q lung scans may correctly exclude PE in more patients than either test alone. Further studies in a large unselected population are needed to confirm these results.\r"

The histologic diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration/cutting needle (Tru-Cut) biopsy, surgical specimens, or transbronchial biopsy. There were no unique ultrasonographic features for diagnosis of specific tumors. Ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsies (UGAB) were performed in 44 of the malignant lesions and in 14 of the benign lesions (nine of the noncystic lesions and five of the cystic lesions). Cytologic diagnosis of malignancies was obtained in 34 (77 percent) of these 44 malignancies; however, accurate histologic classifications of malignancies were achieved in only 24 (55 percent). Accurate diagnoses were achieved in only three (33 percent) of the nine noncystic benign lesions. Ultrasonically guided cutting biopsies (UGCB) were performed in 24 malignant and five benign lesions. All attempts yielded satisfactory specimens for histologic diagnosis. Using UGAB and UGCB together, a positive diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent (39/44) of the malignancies, and accurate histologic diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent and 78 percent (7/9) in malignant and benign noncystic lesions, respectively. Correct histologic diagnosis with UGAB alone is lower in thymoma (55 percent [6/11]) and lymphoma (30 percent [3/10]) but higher in lung cancer (67 percent [8/12]) and metastatic cancer (78 percent [7/9]). There were no complications in this series. We conclude that ultrasonography with UGAB has a high diagnostic yield in diagnosing mediastinal tumors, and UGCB is necessary for thymic tumors, lymphoma, and benign lesions.\r"

After this time, the pleural exudate level exceeded the corresponding serum twofold to tenfold. The mean percentage penetration into the inflammatory compartment was approximately 210 percent. Our data suggested that ciprofloxacin penetrates well into the pleural fluid of patients with empyema thoracis. The concentrations achieved were well above the MIC90 of most pathogens normally found in patients with empyema thoracis for a period of approximately 12 h.\r"

These patients were also evaluated for bronchodilator response to two other aerosol delivery systems routinely used in standard clinical practice, the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and the jet nebulizer (JN). Albuterol was administered from each of the delivery systems in the following manner: MDI, two actuations (180 micrograms); JN, 0.5 ml of 0.5 percent solution (2.5 mg) in 1.0 ml saline solution diluent; and USN, 0.5 ml of 0.5 percent solution (2.5 mg) in 2.5 ml saline solution diluent. Patients demonstrated significant bronchodilator responses to all three delivery systems (p less than 0.0001). The USN produced a greater percentage of increase in FEV1 15 minutes after treatment with albuterol (35.8 +/- 2.3 percent) than either the MDI (18.2 +/- 3.4 percent) or JN (20.8 +/- 3.1 percent) (p less than 0.005). The mean percentage of increase in FE1 observed over a 4-h period after treatment was also greater for the USN (26.5 +/- 2.5 percent) than either the MDI (18.8 +/- 1.8 percent) or JN (15.0 +/- 1.6 percent) (p less than 0.001).

Because serotonin may be a central respiratory stimulant and because the serotonin-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, is usually well tolerated, we wanted to try fluoxetine in the treatment of OSA. Therefore, we compared the effect of fluoxetine to that of protriptyline in 12 patients with OSA. Both drugs significantly decreased the proportion of REM sleep time and decreased the number of apneas or hypopneas in NREM sleep. The response to fluoxetine was equivalent to that of protriptyline; however, for the group as a whole, there was no significant improvement in the number of arterial oxygen desaturation events, the level of arterial oxygen desaturation, or the number of arousals with either agent. Although there was wide variability in the response to each medication, six of the 12 patients had good responses, including improvement in oxygenation, to either fluoxetine or protriptyline. Three patients could not complete the trial of protriptyline. We conclude that fluoxetine is beneficial to some, but not all, patients with OSA. Fluoxetine was better tolerated than protriptyline.\r"

Of the 199 patients with N2 disease, 144 underwent curative resection. The five-year survival rate of these 144 patients was 20.3 percent, which was significantly better than that of either the noncuratively resected N2 group or the N3 group. Nodal metastases in the curatively resected patients involved superior and inferior mediastinum irrespective of the location of the primary tumor. Patients with right-sided N2 lesions and metastases to the superior mediastinum had a worse survival than those with metastases to the inferior mediastinum. In contrast, patients with left-sided N2 lesions metastasizing to the inferior mediastinum had a significantly worse survival than those with lesions metastasizing to the superior mediastinum. Patients with single-level metastases had a significantly better survival rate than those with multilevel metastases. Subcarinal nodal involvement had an unfavorable effect in case of single-level metastasis, but did not affect the survival in cases of multilevel metastases. Our present study indicated that the survival of patients with N2 disease was affected by the operative radicality, by the number of levels of metastases, and also by the location of the nodal involvement. It seems appropriate that extensive mediastinal dissection should be performed irrespective of the location of the primary tumor.\r"

  ".W": "To facilitate the studies in cell biology and drug sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer, cell samples from 55 patients have been used to establish cell lines in culture using a chemically defined medium (ACL-4). A total of 20 cell lines (36 percent) were directly established and characterized: 14 (44 percent) from pleural effusions, five (29 percent) from resected primary tumors, and one (25 percent) from ascitic fluids. They comprised 16 adenocarcinoma, two large cell carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one malignant mesothelioma. Each cell line had distinct gross morphologic features and population doubling times from 21 to 75 h. The plating efficiency was 0.01 to 9.51 percent. The modal chromosome number varied from 45 to 108. Secretion of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl Lewis Xi, CA 50, CA 125, and CA 19-9) into the medium was also different in each cell line. Most of the cell lines have been xenografted into nude mice and found to be tumorigenic. Survival of 20 patients whose tumor cell specimens continually grew in culture at any time during their clinical course was significantly shorter than that of 35 patients with no in vitro tumour growth (median survival time of 28 weeks vs 53 weeks, p = 0.0093). Our study indicates that in vitro tumor cell growth appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the incidence, etiology, and consequences of ventilator-associated pneumonia in 1,000 consecutive patients admitted in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 264 patients were submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours. Fifty-eight (21.9 percent) patients developed a bacterial pneumonia after a mean of 7.9 days (range, 2 to 40 days) of MV. In addition, they were ten superinfections in nine patients, raising the mean incidence to 25.7 percent. Five patients developed secondary bacteremia, and another five had septic shock. Identification of the causative agent of pneumonia was possible in 47 episodes by means of highly specific techniques (telescoping plugged catheter, blood cultures, and/or necropsy). Thirteen (27.6 percent) of these cases were polymicrobial. The predominant pathogens isolated in the first episode of pneumonia were Gram-negative bacilli (62.6 percent), but a high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus infection (23.2 percent) was detected. Gram-negative bacilli represented 66.6 percent of the total organisms isolated in superinfections. The mortality rate in the pneumonia group was 42 percent; this percentage is similar to mortality rate among MV patients without pneumonia (37 percent). We conclude that nosocomial pneumonia is a frequent complication of MV in the medical-surgical ICU. Ventilator-associated pneumonia does not appear to increase fatality in critically ill patients with a high mortality rate (38 percent); however, it significantly prolongs the length of stay in the ICU for survivors.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanically assisted intermittent positive-pressure ventilation effectively provides ventilatory support in patients with respiratory failure but it requires placing an artificial airway. We have previously reported our successful experience delivering mechanical ventilation via a face mask (FMMV) rather than with an endotracheal tube in a pilot study of patients with acute respiratory failure. The present investigation evaluated an additional 18 patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to determine the efficacy of FMMV in a more homogeneous group and to determine factors predicting its success. FMMV was successful in avoiding intubation in 13 of the 18 patients. A significant initial improvement in PCO2 (greater than 16 percent decrease) and in pH (from less than 7.30 to greater than 7.30) predicted success. The five patients who failed on FMMV required endotracheal intubation because of inability to improve gas exchange (three patients), apnea due to sedatives (one patient), and management of secretions (one patient). FMMV was generally well accepted with only two patients withdrawn because of intolerance of the mask. The mean duration of FMMV was 25 h. Complications were seen in only two patients (11 percent): aspiration (one patient) and mild skin necrosis (one patient). Seven patients entered the study by meeting entrance criteria after an unsuccessful extubation attempt and therefore received both forms of mechanical ventilation. All but one patient avoided reintubation, and the face mask proved to be as effective as the endotracheal tube as a conduit for delivering the mechanical tidal volume and improving gas exchange. Our findings indicate that FMMV is a viable option for short-term (one to four days) ventilatory support of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and insufficiency.\r"

Increases in heart rate are also known to produce decreases in the pulmonary artery acceleration time. To explore the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, and Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time, experimental acute pulmonary hypertension was created in nine Duroc swine, either by infusion of Sephadex beads with embolization of the pulmonary arterial circulation or by partially occluding the main pulmonary artery 8 to 10 cm distal to the pulmonic valve. Pulmonary artery Doppler flow velocity recordings and invasive pressure measurements were made at baseline and at paced atrial rates ranging from 60 to 160 beats per minute, in 20-beat increments. The results in this acute animal model reveal that increases in heart rate produced significant decreases in Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time at mean pressures below 25 mm Hg. However, with mean pulmonary artery pressures greater than 25 mm Hg, both heart rate and increases in pulmonary artery pressure had no significant effect on acceleration time.\r"

Nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs were embolized with polystyrene microspheres, and the velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was studied with use of an invasive pulsed Doppler technique. Phasic intraluminal velocity was recorded with use of a miniature piezoelectric crystal activated by 20-MHz Doppler pulses and mounted on the tip of a needle probe introduced into the pulmonary artery. The recorded Doppler quadrature signals were processed by spectral analysis. Significant increases occurred in mean, systolic, and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures (p less than 0.0002), in pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.005), and in negative velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed toward the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.002). Significant decreases occurred in right ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.006) and in positive velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed away from the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.005). A significant shortening in the time to peak velocity (acceleration time) was found (p less than 0.005). Second-order regression analyses demonstrated an inverse correlation between the ratio of positive velocity time to negative velocity time and the mean pulmonary artery pressure in all animals (r = 0.71). These findings should be compared with the velocity patterns of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery obtained under pulmonary hypertensive conditions due to various causes to facilitate interpretation and understanding of clinical investigations.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional ventilatory support of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) consists of volume-cycled ventilation with applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that this strategy, as currently implemented, may perpetuate lung damage by overinflating and injuring distensible alveolar tissues. An alternative strategy--termed inverse ratio ventilation (IRV)--extends the inspiratory time, and, in concept, maintains or improves gas exchange at lower levels of PEEP and peak distending pressures. There are two methods to administer IRV: (1) volume-cycled ventilation with an end-inspiratory pause, or with a slow or decelerating inspiratory flow rate; or (2) pressure-controlled ventilation applied with a long inspiratory time. There are several real or theoretical problems common to both forms of IRV: excessive gas-trapping; adverse hemodynamic effects; and the need for sedation in most patients. Although there are many anecdotal reports of IRV, there are no controlled studies that compare outcome in ARDS patients treated with IRV as opposed to conventional ventilation. Nonetheless, clinicians are using IRV with increasing frequency. In the absence of well-designed clinical trials, we present interim guidelines for a ventilatory strategy in patients with ARDS based on the literature and our own clinical experience.\r"

Splenectomy was performed, demonstrating the spleen to be enlarged and hemorrhagic. The pleural effusion did not recur after splenectomy. The three effusions due to splenic hematomas reported previously cleared only after splenectomy, suggesting splenectomy may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation. We propose possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend that splenic vein thrombosis be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained left-sided pleural effusions.\r"

Preoperative considerations included the possibility of satellite lesions, left atrial origin, and a question of tricuspid valve involvement. Subsequent operative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated single-stalk attachment in the right atrial septal wall and no satellite lesions. Doppler and color flow examination immediately following tumor removal aided in the decision not to perform tricuspid annuloplasty as there was no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The combined use of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler and color flow imaging aids in the preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial tumors.\r"
