Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transformation functions (MNC-TF) were evaluated at the pre-1st and post-2nd cryofiltration treatment. MNC-TF pretreatment were significantly suppressed. Post-2nd cryofiltration, MNC-TF were improved.

Therefore, the proliferative response of peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) mononuclear cells (MNC) towards a variety of mycobacterial antigen preparations was tested in patients with RA and various non-RA inflammatory joint diseases. The antigen panel included a recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacterial origin which has recently been shown to stimulate arthritogenic rat T cell clones. In our study, no significant response towards the 65 kDa protein was observed with PBMNC of patients with or without RA. When compared to normal donors, the reactivity towards heat killed BCG M. tuberculosis and purified protein derivative was reduced in the blood of patients with RA while enhanced in the non-RA group, however these differences did not reach statistical significance. The data obtained with PBMNC were in striking contrast to the proliferative response of SFMNC. In the majority of cases both with RA and non-RA joint diseases the latter compartment was far better stimulated by mycobacterial antigens including the 65 kDa protein compared to corresponding PBMNC. However, in some cases an enhanced stimulation of SFMNC was also obtained with tetanus toxoid. Our data suggest that the enhanced reactivity of SFMNC may be a common feature of several inflammatory joint diseases and is not restricted to RA. These findings may indicate a preferential homing of antigen reactive (memory) T cells to the inflamed joints while the circulating pool of lymphocytes is depleted of this population.\r"

Thus, a direct comparison could be made of nerves and mast cells in the ankle joints of healthy rats and in those with severe adjuvant induced polyarthritis. Nerves were studied with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) immunostaining, using heterologous antisera to protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a recently discovered neural protein, and the neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). Mast cells were visualized by metachromatic staining of granule heparin. With double staining of sections, a parallel distribution of mast cells and nerves in all parts of the normal synovium was noted. In rats with adjuvant induced arthritis, a near total parallel disappearance of mast cells and nerves in the synovium occurred. In the arthritic rat such mast cell/nerve \"units\" were only present in the region where synovium attaches to bone. The observed regional depletion of both nerves and mast cells in arthritis may be of importance in the pathophysiology of arthritis.\r"

At 6 weeks sacrifice, the same dose of Rumalon was associated with a trend toward reduction in the number of animals with ulcerations. Rumalon administered at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg for 12 weeks reduced the number of animals with ulcers, although not at the p less than 0.05 level of significance. Semiquantitative histologic evaluations revealed no differences between control and treatment groups either in the thickness of articular cartilage, density of cells present, safranin-O stain or ratio of DNA/protein. Increased proteoglycan synthesis characteristic of OA was modulated toward normal in association with Rumalon therapy. Diminished OA changes in response to Rumalon are consistent with an ameliorative response to this agent in the partial meniscectomy model in the rabbit.\r"

In addition most of the T cells express the alpha beta receptor while only 2.8% express the gamma delta receptor.

There was a reduction of IgG and IgA levels in older DFMO treated mice, whereas IgM level was not affected. Proteinuria and BUN were also significantly reduced in treated mice. Moreover, DFMO treatment reduced the concentration of putrescine and spermidine in spleen cells.

Of 186 such patients, 59 developed clinically evident nephritis (32%) compared to 263 of the other 476 patients (55%) (p less than 10(-7). RF showed only a weak inverse relationship to nephritis (p = 0.064). We conclude that the presence of persistent rheumatoid-like arthritis in patients with SLE identifies a clinical subset of patients who are less likely to develop nephritis than those with no arthralgia, no objective arthritis or only episodic arthritis. We hypothesize that such patients represent a genetically determined subset among patients with SLE and that perhaps they are more likely to bear the HLA-DR4 allele.\r"

These included nephritis, dermatitis, hypocomplementemia, antibodies against dsDNA, and circulating immune complexes. A negative correlation was found with neurological disease manifestations.

To assess the relationship between soluble IL-2R levels and other serological markers, we compared levels of soluble IL-2R and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies in SLE sera. In a cross sectional study of 34 patients with SLE, soluble IL-2R levels were elevated compared with healthy individuals (1126 U/ml vs 235 U/ml, p less than 0.0001), and a significant correlation between levels of soluble IL-2R and anti-dsDNA antibodies was present (r = 0.543, p = 0.0009). In a longitudinal study of 10 additional patients, the time courses of soluble IL-2R levels and anti-dsDNA antibody measurements were similar in 3 patients. In 7 patients, substantial differences in the levels of soluble IL-2R and anti-dsDNA antibodies over time were observed, including marked changes in anti-dsDNA antibody levels that were accompanied by only minor changes in soluble IL-2R levels, and soluble IL-2R measurements that were persistently elevated despite generally low anti-dsDNA antibody levels. Our results indicate that soluble IL-2R levels may not always parallel other serological markers of SLE, suggesting measurement of different facets of immune system activation by various assays.\r"

While both SSc and normal fibroblasts increased fibronectin release at all concentrations of TGF-beta tested, the percentage increases were not statistically greater for the SSc fibroblasts even though 4 of the SSc fibroblasts strains were selectively sensitive to low concentrations of TGF-beta. TGF-beta increased cell numbers of both SSc and normal strains equally.

  ".W": "A characteristic feature of fibroblasts cultured from affected skin areas of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and localized scleroderma (morphea) is excessive activation of collagen biosynthesis. To elucidate the nature of fibroblast activation in scleroderma we have studied the expression of 3 noncollagenous connective tissue components, osteonectin, small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (proteoglycan II, decorin), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), by measuring their mRNA levels in fibroblast cultures from 6 patients with SSc and 3 with morphea. A clear correlation was observed between the increase in type I collagen and osteonectin mRNA in these cell lines. The apparent overproduction of osteonectin by scleroderma fibroblasts is in accordance with the suggested activation of osteonectin expression during tissue remodeling. The levels of decorin mRNA showed marked variation in the cell lines, but were in no correlation with collagen or osteonectin mRNA. The levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA were found to be slightly elevated in fibroblasts grown from affected scleroderma skin. This may suggest that this potent activator of collagen production has a role during the initial activation of dermal fibroblasts both in SSc and morphea.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies to Jo-1 (alpha Jo-1) are most characteristically detected in patients with the idiopathic inflammatory muscle disease polymyositis (PM). The Jo-1 antigen has previously been identified as histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS). In order to clarify the cellular localization of the antigenic targets recognized by the alpha Jo-1 antibody, immunofluorescence (IF) studies were performed with cultured human myoblasts. Incubation with alpha Jo-1 positive sera demonstrated granular cytoplasmic as well as nuclear staining, but only the cytoplasmic fluorescence was specifically inhibited by preabsorbing the sera with recombinant histidyl-tRNA synthetase (rHRS). A polyclonal rabbit anti-rHRS sera demonstrated granular cytoplasmic IF which was also specifically inhibited by preincubation with rHRS protein. Alpha Jo-1 negative healthy control or patient sera demonstrated nonspecific low intensity staining. 35S methionine biosynthetically labelled myoblast cell extracts immunoprecipitated with alpha Jo-1 positive sera and analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed a specific band of the same molecular weight as the rHRS antigen. Our studies demonstrate that alpha Jo-1 specifically binds to antigen in the cytoplasm of cultured myoblasts. Alpha Jo-1 has been shown to inhibit HRS activity in vitro. Given the importance of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases such as HRS to intracellular protein assembly, intracytoplasmic binding and enzyme inhibition in vivo may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune muscle damage in PM.\r"

  ".W": "Induration of the skin develops in a majority of patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan, and bears striking clinical and histopathological resemblance to eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). These similarities have led to the suggestion that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF are the same disease. To study the relationship of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and EF, we ascertained the prevalence of L-tryptophan use in a cohort of patients with EF, and compared their clinical and laboratory findings to those of patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated cutaneous involvement. None of 11 patients who were diagnosed as having EF between 1970 and 1989 used L-tryptophan containing preparations prior to the onset of their illness. Marked clinical and laboratory test differences were observed between patients with EF and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a more acute onset, more severe symptoms, higher frequency of rash and of pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, myopathic and thyroid involvement compared to patients with EF. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in improvement of cutaneous involvement in 88% of patients with EF but it was only partially successful in patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Hospitalization and fatalities occurred only among patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. These observations demonstrate that eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a more severe disease with multisystemic involvement that can be clinically distinguished from EF. In contrast to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, EF is not associated with L-tryptophan ingestion.\r"

By comparison, patients with gout from the same clinical data base, but without myotoxicity, had normal renal function. The data yield clear guidelines for safe use of colchicine chronically.\r"

Clinical remission ensued accompanied by normalization of levels of circulating autoantibodies, immune complexes, complement proteins, interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor. High spontaneous peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation fluctuated widely with plasmapheresis, but was consistently reduced after cyclophosphamide. Circulating B cells fell by 85% and remained low at one year, despite recovery of the serum IgG level. Circulating T cells declined by 48%, chiefly in the immunologically naive CD4+CD45R+ T cell subset. This was associated with the emergence of a CD8+DR+CDw29+ T cell subset signifying immunologically mature, activated cytotoxic/suppressive T cells, which might have served to control the autoreactive B and T cell populations. Pulsed cyclophosphamide synchronized with plasmapheresis profoundly affected the immune system of our patient. The association of these immunological changes with clinical recovery warrants further investigation of this new therapeutic approach in SLE.\r"

  ".U": "91218187\r", 
  ".W": "In 1990, bladder cancer, excluding carcinoma in situ, was estimated to contribute 49,000 cases of cancer. In men 75 years old or older, it became the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Of patients with bladder cancer, 75%-80% initially present with superficial bladder tumors. Treatment of these tumors has three objectives: 1) to eradicate existing disease, 2) to provide prophylaxis against tumor recurrence, and 3) to avoid deep invasion into the muscle layers of the bladder. Transurethral resection is the primary treatment to eradicate superficial bladder tumors, but 40%-80% of these tumors recur. Because of these high recurrence rates, adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with cytotoxic and immunomodulatory drugs has gained widespread use. The past two decades of clinical investigations in superficial bladder cancer have provided valuable information on the biology and treatment of the disease. Multivariate analyses have indicated that tumor grade and stage are the most important prognostic variables commonly available to the clinician to identify the patient at greatest risk of developing muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer. These studies have also identified groups at low risk for tumor recurrence and invasive bladder cancer. Randomized trials have shown that recurrence rates are decreased by adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with a number of drugs: bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), doxorubicin, ethoglucid (Epodyl), mitomycin-C, teniposide, and thiotepa. However, few studies indicate that adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy can prevent progression to invasive bladder cancer in the high-risk patient with superficial bladder cancer. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether such therapy can prevent invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and improve disease-free survival in this group. In addition, the identification of tests (e.g., monoclonal antibody tests, chromosomal analyses, and tumor marker assays) that can help to identify high-risk patients is needed to better develop therapeutic strategies for superficial bladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment or prophylaxis against opportunistic infection have resulted in prolongation of the survival of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Previous research has demonstrated an association between AIDS and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In addition to the approximately 3% of individuals found to have NHL at the time of AIDS onset, others continue to develop NHL following AIDS diagnosis. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute demonstrated a sharply increasing incidence of NHL among men in the age range 20-49 years since 1983 in the United States. Based on new data on the risk of NHL following AIDS diagnosis, on estimates of improved survival following AIDS diagnosis, and on projections of future AIDS incidence, we considered four sets of assumptions and estimated the number of AIDS-related NHL cases in 1992 to be between 2900 and 9800. Three of these projections were higher than the estimate of 4700 cases obtained by linear extrapolation of SEER incidence trends. These projections of AIDS-related NHL incidence suggest that between 8% and 27% of all NHL cases that occur in the United States in 1992 will arise as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), imposing a substantial health care burden. More research into the pathogenesis of lymphoma and new approaches to antiretroviral and antilymphoma therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this formidable complication of infection with HIV.\r"

  ".U": "91218189\r", 
  ".W": "In our prospective study, flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA content was performed on unfixed fresh specimens of colorectal adenocarcinoma taken from 176 patients. Of the 176 tumors, 113 (64%) were aneuploid. There was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor stage, grade, location, or size. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no correlation between DNA or RNA content and patient survival was found. DNA content alone was not an independent prognostic factor when the colorectal carcinomas were segregated by curable and incurable stages. However, normal mucosa, diploid tumors, and aneuploid tumors showed progressively higher proliferation and higher RNA and DNA indices. Proliferative fraction--defined as the percentage of cells in S + G2 and M phases of the cell cycle--was significantly related to ploidy and to Dukes' stage. Despite these correlations, we did not detect a significant influence of proliferative fraction on survival when patients were segregated above or below the mean proliferative fraction for all tumors. More accurate methods of identifying the proliferative fraction of tumor cells are currently being pursued. While the role of flow cytometry in the evaluation and management of patients with colorectal carcinoma is still undefined for a number of other cellular parameters, it seems unlikely that DNA index, RNA index, or the proliferative fractions calculated from the DNA histogram, will, of themselves, represent independent prognostic factors.\r"

MDR1 RNA levels were negative in 29% and positive in 71% of the patients. The complete remission rate in response to induction chemotherapy was 89% for MDR1 RNA-negative patients and 53% for MDR1 RNA-positive patients (P = .008). Expression of the MDR1 gene was observed in most patients who died early or had resistant disease. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a decrease in both disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with detectable MDR1 gene expression compared with the disease-free survival and overall survival of MDR1 RNA-negative patients (P = .029 and P = .009, respectively). These data indicate that MDR1 gene expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor and suggest that multidrug resistance is important in AML.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of expression of the murine nm23 gene inversely correlate with metastatic potential in several rodent tumor model systems. Expression of the human nm23 homologue also is lower in human breast cancers of high metastatic potential than in breast cancers of low metastatic potential. In the present study, we examined changes in nm23 expression during colon carcinogenesis as found in 18 matched pairs of normal and neoplastic human colon tissues. We found that a 0.8-kilo-base nm23 transcript was expressed in all samples of morphologically normal colon mucosa. In 16 of 18 colon neoplasms, nm23 expression was further increased in the neoplastic, compared with the morphologically normal, colon mucosa from the same individual. Expression of nm23 was elevated over normal mucosa in 3 of 3 polyps, in 2 of 3 nonmetastatic cancers, and in 11 of the 12 cancers that were metastatic at the initial presentation. The levels of nm23 expressed were similar in the 12 metastatic colon neoplasms and in the 6 colon neoplasms of lower clinical stage. In addition, nm23 expression was maintained in culture in each of 12 cell lines initiated from human colon neoplasms and did not differ between lines established from neoplasms of high or low metastatic capability. We concluded that nm23 was expressed in normal colon mucosa. Expression of nm23 increased during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and remained increased in metastatic colon cancer. Therefore, in the colon, tissue-specific events dissociate nm23 expression from loss of tumor metastatic competence.\r"

  ".W": "A neoangiogenic response is critical for the unrestricted growth of solid tumors beyond a few millimeters in diameter. Release of adequate growth-stimulating activity from tumor cells is obviously required for the stimulation of blood vessel growth, and blockade of such stimulatory activity should repress tumor growth at the microscopic level. To test this hypothesis and to study appropriate inhibitors, we used a human adrenal cancer cell line (SW-13/K-fgf) engineered to secrete Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF), which we previously showed to induce growth of highly vascularized subcutaneous tumors in animals by autocrine and paracrine stimuli. In the present study, we tested different polysulfates for their selective inhibition of proliferation induced by K-FGF versus proliferation independent of K-FGF. Suramin and dextran sulfate showed slight selective inhibition of K-FGF-induced proliferation, ie, inhibition three- and five-fold greater, respectively, than the inhibition of proliferation independent of K-FGF. In contrast, heparin was inactive. The heparin analogue pentosan polysulfate (PPS), however, showed selective inhibition that was more than 2000-fold greater. The inhibitory effects of PPS on growth of SW-13/K-fgf cells, as well as endothelial cells, were fully reversible by an excess of added FGF. Daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS were tolerated well by athymic nude mice and prevented growth of subcutaneous SW-13/K-fgf tumor xenografts. PPS will be a useful tool to elucidate the effects of FGFs in vitro and in vivo and appears to be a prototype for the development of tumoricidal therapy based on targeting of growth factors.\r"

Nearly one third of patients receiving high-dose cisplatin still experience substantial emesis despite the best available conventional antiemetics, and the toxic effects of these agents remain quite troublesome. In recent years, a new class of agents, the serotonin antagonists, has been identified. These agents hold promise for clinical utility in a wide range of areas. Selective antagonists of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 (5-HT3) receptor have proven in early clinical trials to be potent antiemetic agents in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, with efficacy comparable to or superior to that of conventional antiemetics. Toxic effects to date with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been modest. The current state of knowledge with respect to these agents as antiemetics for patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is summarized.\r"

The maximum tolerated dose of etoposide was 175 mg/m2 per day when administered with dipyridamole at a fixed dose of 24 mg/m2 per day. Dose-limiting toxic effects were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. No other major toxic effects were observed. The free peritoneal etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations varied with the etoposide dose rate, reaching 218.9 and 25.3 microM, respectively, at an etoposide dose rate of 175 mg/m2 per day. The free etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations attained were well within the range needed for synergistic interaction.\r"

Nude mice receiving intravenous injection with a suspension of human colonic cancer cells (GW-39) developed multiple (10-100) tumor nodules throughout the lungs, and more than 50% of the animals died of extensive tumor involvement within 5-10 weeks. Groups of eight or nine animals bearing 7-day-old tumor transplants were treated with a single intravenous injection of radioiodinated agents: either 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of whole IgG of the NP-4 murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of whole IgG of Immu-31, an anti-alpha-fetoprotein (anti-AFP) MAb. Treatment of animals with 0.15 or 0.30 mCi of 131I-labeled NP-4 IgG 7 days after injection of tumor cells resulted in survival for 23 weeks after tumor implantation in four of eight and seven of nine animals, respectively. Microscopic examination revealed that over 90% of the lung tumor colonies had no evidence of surviving cells. Animals treated with 0.30 mCi of anti-AFP, an irrelevant MAb, survived 4 weeks longer than controls. Toxicity was evident in four of the 17 animals given 0.30 mCi of NP-4 IgG (specific) or anti-AFP IgG (irrelevant) MAb. These animals died within 1-3 weeks after radioantibody injection, suggesting that death was related to the radiation dose. None of the animals given 0.15 mCi of 131I-MAb died within this period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The levels of 3H in blood and most tissues peaked approximately 15 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of [3H]porfiromycin. The levels of radioactivity present in most of the tissues and in the tumors were similar at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration. Most of the normal tissues showed uniform, low grain densities when analyzed by autoradiography; the liver and the small intestine had the highest labeling densities. Only kidney, bladder, and tumor showed differential distributions of grains from [3H]porfiromycin. In the kidney, higher grain counts were found in cortex than in medullary regions; grains were uniformly distributed within each region. In the bladder, the highest labeling densities were found in regions near the lumen. Tumor regions that had some necrotic features or regions of necrosis that included some viable cells showed higher labeling intensities than healthy-looking tumor regions, probably because the abnormal microenvironments in these regions led to increased rates of activation of porfiromycin to electrophilic species. These findings show that porfiromycin can reach and be activated in tumor regions containing cells resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents and to x rays. The results also support the concept that agents such as porfiromycin can target cells in specific microenvironmental subpopulations of solid tumors.\r"

Significant high frequency of allelic deletion (22%-44%) at chromosome 13 loci (D13S31, D13S32, D13S33, and D13S34) at bands q12-q34 was observed in tumor tissues. These results led us to investigate the loss of heterozygosity at the retinoblastoma (RB) locus in ovarian tumors, because the RB gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located at 13q14. Analysis of the variable number of tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in intron 20 in the RB gene revealed that 6 (30%) of 20 patients with informative samples showed allelic loss at the RB locus in their tumor tissues. This loss, of relatively high frequency, suggests that the RB gene, or a closely linked gene, seems to be involved in the development of ovarian cancer.\r"

Of 37 of the sections with evidence of intestinal-type cancer, 33 (89.2%) contained H pylori in noncancerous tissue compared with 7 (31.8%) of 22 of the sections with evidence of diffuse-type cancer (odds ratio = 17.7; P less than .001). This association remained strong when controlled for age, sex, site, and number of sections reviewed. The prevalence of H pylori in intestinal-type gastric cancer far exceeded the prevalence of H pylori in diffuse disease and that described in the normal US population. This finding suggests that H pylori may be a cofactor in development of intestinal-type gastric cancer.\r"

Thirty (97%) of the 31 nonresponders developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen after 2.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) revaccinations. Twenty-nine (94%) of the 31 nonresponders had anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. The immunoglobulin subclass of the antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen was mainly IgG1. After 1 year, 23 (74%) of the 31 nonresponders continued to have anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. Persons accidentally exposed to specimens positive for hepatitis B e antigen developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen following 3.1 +/- 1.1 revaccinations. None developed clinical hepatitis. There was no production of anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibody 1 year after exposure, indicating that protection was 100%. Intradermal hepatitis B vaccination is useful in reversing nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B surface antigen and for prophylaxis after exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Total body and regional bone mineral density (BMD) levels were determined in 26 premenopausal women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis receiving long-term physiological doses of levothyroxine sodium replacement therapy. The BMD levels of each patient were compared with the mean of the BMD levels of age-matched normal controls. The mean levothyroxine sodium dose was 111 +/- 6 micrograms/d, and the mean duration of treatment was 7.5 +/- 5.3 years (range, 1 to 24 years). Dietary calcium intake was similar in both groups, as were serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine index, and thyrotropin levels. Women receiving the levothyroxine treatment had normal total body BMD levels but had significantly lower BMD levels at the femoral neck (-5.7%), femoral trochanter (-7.0%), Ward's triangle (-10.6%), both arms (right, -7.8%; left, -8.9%), and pelvis (-4.9%). In contrast, lumbar spine BMD levels were similar in the two groups. There was no correlation between the total body or different regional BMD levels and the duration or dosage of levothyroxine treatment or thyroid function test results. However, the z score of the femoral neck of these patients showed a significant negative correlation with their serum free thyroxine index levels. We conclude that patients receiving physiological doses of levothyroxine may have decreased bone density. Thyroid functions in patients receiving long-term levothyroxine treatment should be closely monitored and bone densitometry should be performed in patients at risk for osteoporosis.\r"

Early cardiac effects include myocarditis (occasionally with congestive heart failure), pericardial inflammation, and, rarely, valve involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described. However, since long-term epidemiologic studies have not yet been performed, it is prudent to consider childhood Kawasaki disease to be a potential risk factor for coronary disease, especially in atherosclerosis-prone Western societies.\r"

Diagnosis is difficult and treatment failure common; therefore, preventive measures are important. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated selective decontamination of the oropharynx with polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin sulfate, and vancomycin hydrochloride (PNV) in 52 patients requiring mechanical ventilation during a 3- to 34-day period (mean, 10 days). Either PNV or placebo was administered six times daily in the oropharynx. During the first 12 days of intubation, tracheobronchial colonization by gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as pneumonia, occurred less frequently in the PNV than in the placebo group (16% vs 78%; P less than .0001). Hospital mortality was not different, but systemic antibiotics were prescribed less often in the PNV group and no resistant microorganism emerged. In these critically ill patients, topical oropharyngeal antibiotic application lowered the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia by a factor of 5, probably by interrupting the stomach-to-trachea route of infection, and decreased the requirement for intravenous antibiotics.\r"

As developing nations increasingly place priority on the education of their youth, early marriage and precocious child rearing are discouraged, and other problems, such as out-of-wedlock childbirth and illicit abortions, emerge. Problems such as substance abuse and suicide arise with the urban migration, increased unemployment, and disruption of traditional social structures that are experienced as developing countries industrialize.\r"

With the exclusion of two patients (one with interval metastases between staged resections and one without histologically proved metastases), three patients were found to have unresectable disease (median survival, 7 months). A significantly (P = 0.0001) longer median survival (28 months) was found for 34 patients whose recurrent metastases were completely resected. The only other factor predicting significantly longer post-thoracotomy survival was resection of a solitary metastatic nodule (median survival, 65 months). Patients who had two or more recurrent nodules resected had a median survival of 14 months only (P = 0.01). Although trends toward longer survival were noted for other prognostic factors, none reached statistical significance. We conclude that the complete resection of a solitary second (recurrent) pulmonary metastatic nodule from adult soft tissue sarcoma predicts long-term survival.\r"

Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg.\r"

This analysis at 12 months showed a disease free survival of 71% in the test arm vs. 45% in the control arm, which is statistically highly significant (P less than 0.01). Analysis of recurrence pattern showed that recurrence at the primary site was dramatically reduced during the first 6 postoperative months (P less than 0.01). Our study provided further clinical evidence in support of the concepts of Goldie and Coleman that the timing of chemotherapeutic drugs is very critical for a successful end result.\r"

However, a retrospective study of 24 years' materials with unresectable PLC indicated that 5-year survival of unresectable PLC has increased from 0% in 1966-1977 (n = 137) to 16.9% in 1978-1989 (n = 345). This encouraging improvement was mainly a result of cytoreduction therapy followed by sequential resection. Multimodality combination treatment with hepatic artery ligation, plus hepatic artery infusion with chemotherapy, plus radioimmunotherapy (or radiotherapy) yielded the highest sequential resection rate (30.6%) and 5-year survival (28.0%) as compared with double combination and single modality treatment. The 5-year survival of 33 patients receiving sequential resection after cytoreduction therapy was 63.2%. It is suggested that cytoreduction and sequential resection might offer a hope for surgically verified unresectable PLC.\r"

  ".W": "This study represents retrospective analysis of 87 patients with a carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract seen and followed in the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) from 1960 to 1986. In 49 cases, the primary site was the small bowel. The rest of the cases were distributed as follows: 11 appendix, 10 rectum, 5 stomach, and 7 undetermined. We extrapolated the Dukes' and modified Astler-Coller surgicopathological classifications used for colorectal cancer for use in our cases of carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract. A strong correlation was found, using this staging, with disease-specific survival. Other prognostic factors included histologic differentiation, the presence of macroscopic residual disease after initial surgery, and level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine. Among 51 patients with surgically grossly removed disease, there was a tendency for the development of distant and distant/locoregional recurrence more often than locoregional recurrence alone. The liver was the commonest site of distant recurrence. Analysis of the effect of radiotherapy or chemotherapy on carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract proved unsuccessful because only a small portion of the patients had this treatment, and it was used mainly for palliation.\r"

Application of FAM immediately before operation resulted in significant impairment of wound healing in the early postoperative period. Once the proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis had led to an increase of mechanical strength, no negative effect on wound healing could be detected applying the same chemotherapeutic agents. These findings indicate the early inflammatory phase of the wound healing process to be most vulnerable to the chemotherapeutic effects. This has significant implications if the theoretical advantages of starting adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment in the immediate postoperative period are implemented.\r"

  ".W": "We attempted to define the role of surgery in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Of 81 patients with clinically localized SCLC, 36 underwent surgical resection: 19 underwent initial resection with postoperative chemotherapy, while the remaining 17 were treated initially with chemotherapy, then resection. The remaining 45 patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The 5-year survival for the 36 surgical patients was 38%; median survival time (MST) was 33 months. Nineteen patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy showed a 42% 5-year survival, while 17 patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy showed a 33% 5-year survival. This difference was not significant. However, stage III survival tended to be better in patients with preoperative chemotherapy (MST, 29 months) than in those who had had postoperative chemotherapy only (MST, 17 months). Although survival of the 45 nonsurgical patients was poor, stage I and II patients, or those with complete remission showed a 25% 5-year survival with an MST of 33 months, and a 21% 5-year survival with an MST of 25 months, respectively. We thus concluded that initial resection combined with postoperative chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with stage I, and probably stage II disease. For resectable stage III, particularly in patients with N2 disease, adjuvant resection after chemotherapy may be a favorable choice in the management of SCLC. For advanced stage III, complete remission by chemotherapy should be attempted in combination with radiotherapy.\r"

The morphologic spectrum was broad, with a great prevalence of associated lesions. The actuarial survival rate before definitive repair was 57% at 1 year, 43% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years, worse than prior reports because of the younger age at entry into our series. Analysis of univariate risk factors established that right atrial isomerism (18% of the group, relative risk 2.9), common atrioventricular orifice (42%, 2.0), pulmonary atresia (20%, 3.4), obstruction of the systemic outflow tract (18%, 2.5), and extracardiac anomalous pulmonary venous connection (13%, 3.1) were strongly associated with poorer survival. Pulmonary stenosis (40%, 0.35), balanced pulmonary blood flow (9%, 0.40), and presentation at an older age (3%, 0.42 to 0.18) were beneficial (p less than 0.05 to 0.0001). Multivariate analysis allowed the creation of patient-specific curves for prediction of survival for different anatomic and physiologic variants of double-inlet ventricle. A simple additive index was then derived from the multivariate Cox coefficients to enable stratification of risk for these morphologic subgroups of patients and so assist in the making of clinical decisions in infancy.\r"

  ".U": "91218435\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass management in neonates, infants, and children often requires the use of deep hypothermia at 18 degrees C with occasional periods of circulatory arrest and represents marked physiologic extremes of temperature and perfusion. The safety of these techniques is largely dependent on the reduction of metabolism, particularly cerebral metabolism. We studied the effect of hypothermia on cerebral metabolism during cardiac surgery and quantified the changes. Cerebral metabolism was measured before, during, and after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in 46 pediatric patients, aged 1 day to 14 years. Patients were grouped on the basis of the different bypass techniques commonly used in children: group A--moderate hypothermic bypass at 28 degrees C; group B--deep hypothermic bypass at 18 degrees to 20 degrees C with maintenance of continuous flow; and group C--deep hypothermic circulatory arrest at 18 degrees C. Cerebral metabolism significantly decreased under hypothermic conditions in all groups compared with control levels at normothermia, the data demonstrating an exponential relationship between temperature and cerebral metabolism and an average temperature coefficient of 3.65. There was no significant difference in the rate of metabolism reduction (temperature coefficient) in patients cooled to 28 degrees and 18 degrees C. From these data we were able to derive an equation that numerically expresses a hypothermic metabolic index, which quantitates duration of brain protection provided by reduction of cerebral metabolism owing to hypothermic bypass over any temperature range. Based on this index, patients cooled to 28 degrees C have a predicted ischemic tolerance of 11 to 19 minutes. The predicted duration that the brain can tolerate ischemia (\"safe\" period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest) in patients cooled to 18 degrees C, based on our metabolic index, is 39 to 65 minutes, similar to the safe period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest known to be tolerated clinically. In groups A and B (no circulatory arrest), cerebral metabolism returned to control in the rewarming phase of bypass and after bypass. In group C (circulatory arrest), cerebral metabolism and oxygen extraction remained significantly reduced during rewarming and after bypass, suggesting disordered cerebral metabolism and oxygen utilization after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The results of this study suggest that cerebral metabolism is exponentially related to temperature during hypothermic bypass with a temperature coefficient of 3.65 in neonates infants and children. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest changes cerebral metabolism and blood flow after the arrest period despite adequate hypothermic suppression of metabolism.\r"

The in vitro, in vivo photodynamic therapy sensitivity of a cell line transformed by the Kirsten ras oncogene (45342) was studied to establish a new photodynamic therapy model. With the colony formation assay, neither light alone nor dihematoporphyrin ether alone affected 45342 survival. Energy-dependent photodynamic therapy effects were seen in vitro in dihematoporphyrin ether-incubated and light-exposed cells (90% cytotoxicity = 950 joules/m2; 99% cytotoxicity = 1575 joules/m2; p2 less than 0.05). Subcutaneous allografts of 45342 were established in nu/nu mice, and ideal route (intravenous or intraperitoneal) of dihematoporphyrin ether delivery, dihematoporphyrin ether tissue kinetics, and in vivo photodynamic therapy effects were examined. Intravenous administration not only gave higher levels of the sensitizer in various tissues, but also was associated with less variation than the intraperitoneal route. Selective dihematoporphyrin ether retention was documented in the tumors at 24 hours after injection compared with other tissues, and photodynamic therapy with 0.3 W/cm2 to a total dose of 150 joules/cm2 led to progressive coagulative tumor necrosis and tumor regression. These studies confirm that transformed, malignant cells are sensitive to photodynamic therapy, and this model may prove in future studies to increase efficacy to photodynamic therapy (i.e., with dihematoporphyrin ether delivery by monoclonal antibodies).\r"

The canine subcutaneous bronchial autograft model for studying the progression of epidermoid carcinogenesis (normal----regular squamous metaplasia----mild, moderate, and severe atypical metaplasia----squamous cell carcinoma) provides evidence that severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium is reversible. Among 148 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had serial sampling of the epithelium and exposure to implants of methylcholanthrene, severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 28 that received only a single implant. During the total carcinogen exposure (median 24.5 months), 9 of 28 (32%) developed squamous cell cancer, and 19 of 28 (68%) regressed toward normal. Severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 34 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that received two or more carcinogen implants: epidermoid cancer developed in 26 of 34 (76.5%), and regression toward or to normal occurred in 8 of 34 (23.5%). Severe atypical metaplasia was not detected in 53 subcutaneous bronchial autografts: 19 that received only a single implant and 34 that received two or more implants. Progression and regression occurred among these subcutaneous bronchial autografts in proportions similar to those found in subcutaneous bronchial autografts wherein severe atypical metaplasia was seen. Among 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts initially studied after 6 months of exposure to carcinogen, progression to severe atypical metaplasia was seen 3 months later in 19 of 33 that had additional exposure; in the same interval regression of epithelial abnormalities occurred in 14 of 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had no additional exposure (p less than 0.05). We have presented evidence that severe atypical metaplasia includes at least three cell populations: one committed to cancer without further stimulus, one that regresses despite further carcinogen exposure, and one that requires additional carcinogen to progress to cancer. At least in this model, severe atypical metaplasia is not inexorably precancerous. The subcutaneous bronchial autograft model is suitable for seeking biologic indicators of irreversibility.\r"

To determine the effect of bronchial arterial flush preservation, we studied 54 dogs using the isolated perfused working lung model. After baseline measurements, lungs were flushed with lactated Ringer's solution (60 ml/kg at 8 degrees C) by one of three methods: pulmonary artery perfusion, bronchial artery perfusion through a 15 cm closed aortic segment, or simultaneous pulmonary-bronchial artery perfusion. These groups were further subdivided and tested after 0, 4, and 17 hours of storage at 4 degrees C (n = 6 each). Lungs were ventilated (flow rate 140 ml/kg/min; inspired oxygen fraction 0.21) and continuously reperfused with normothermic deoxygenated autologous blood in a closed loop. Measured variables were hemodynamics, aerodynamics, and leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage. Survival time was determined from initial reperfusion to failure of the lung to oxygenate. After 0 and 4 hours of storage, there was no significant difference in survival times. After 17 hours, lungs subjected to pulmonary-bronchial artery perfusion survived longer than those perfused via either the pulmonary or bronchial arteries alone (120 +/- 24 versus 38 +/- 14 or 52 +/- 16 minutes; p less than 0.01). Pulmonary artery pressure and resistance in all groups except at failure were never different from baseline values in the intact animal. Shunts in the pulmonary-bronchial artery perfusion groups were closest to baseline at onset (8% +/- 4%) and remained lower throughout reperfusion than in the groups subjected to pulmonary or bronchial artery perfusion alone. After 17 hours, static compliance of pulmonary artery-perfused lungs was worse than baseline (1.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2) versus 3.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(-2) L/cm H2O/sec; p less than 0.05), whereas compliance in the pulmonary-bronchial artery perfusion groups remained constant (3.6 +/- 1.5 x 10(-2) L/cm H2O/sec). Elastic work performed by lungs subjected to pulmonary-bronchial artery flushing at onset was significantly lower when these lungs were reperfused immediately (201 +/- 14 versus 295 +/- 35 gm-m/min for pulmonary artery-flushed lungs) or after 4 hours of storage (229 +/- 30 versus 290 +/- 24 gm-m/min for pulmonary artery-flushed lungs). Bronchoalveolar lavage after 17 hours in the group subjected to pulmonary bronchial artery flushing demonstrated leukocyte counts similar to those of intact lungs (45 +/- 5 versus 29 +/- 8/mm3) and significantly less than in lungs subjected to pulmonary or bronchial artery flushing (137 +/- 18 or 82 +/- 10/mm3, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The actuarial survival rate is 77.27% at 12 months and 72.73% at 24 months. There have been no instances of bronchial dehiscence or stenosis, even though 13 of the patients were on a program of preoperative prednisone, every patient had high-dose perioperative methylprednisolone, and omental wraps were not used on any bronchial anastomosis. Of particular interest is the fact that three patients had primary pulmonary hypertension, three had secondary pulmonary hypertension, and 10 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due in five cases to an alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Each of these entities was previously thought to contraindicate single lung transplantation. Donor selection was based on an oxygen tension/inspired oxygen concentration ratio greater than 300, donor/recipient chest circumference within 3 inches, clear chest x-ray film, negative sputum Gram stain, and less than 6-hour estimated ischemic time. Harvest technique included donor prostaglandin E1 500 micrograms, topical slush, and pulmonoplegia with cold Euro-Collins solution. The heart and lung were separated in situ rather than the heart lung block being removed. A telescoping bronchial anastomosis was performed with 4-0 Prolene (not absorbable) sutures. We conclude that single lung transplantation has evolved into a simple operation, necessitating meticulous preoperative and postoperative care, which can be performed on a wide spectrum of critically ill patients with an acceptable mortality rate.\r"

Although saline solution is most frequently used as a transport medium, other crystalloid solutions may be superior. Accordingly, human right atrial trabeculae contracting isometrically in vitro were used to assess five crystalloid solutions at two different temperatures (12 degrees and 4 degrees C): St. Thomas' Hospital solution, modified Krebs-Henseleit (K+ = 16 mEq/L), Krebs-Henseleit (K+ = 4.5 mEq/L, saline, and Euro-Collins. After a 24-hour preservation period the muscles were restimulated at 34 degrees C and recovery of function was monitored for 30 minutes. Recovery of developed force was not affected by temperature (p = 0.13 by two-way analysis of variance). However, St. Thomas' Hospital solution provided the best recovery of developed force (103.3 +/- 6.2% of control) compared with saline, which had the worst developed force (2.8% +/- 1.3%) (p less than 0.002). Modified Krebs-Henseleit, Krebs-Henseleit, and Euro-Collins demonstrated intermediate performance. Although there were no differences between groups in recovery of resting force, it was greater in all groups with muscles cooled to 4 degrees C (238.7% +/- 17.6% of control) (p less than 0.001). Dry/wet weight ratios did not demonstrate statistically significant differences between groups. We conclude that, of the solutions tested, St. Thomas' Hospital solution provides the best preservation of atrial myocardium. Storage in crystalloid solutions leads to impaired relaxation, which is more apparent in tissue cooled to 4 degrees C and does not appear to be solely due to increased tissue swelling.\r"

We compared the energy (in joules) required for 50% and 80% successful termination of ventricular fibrillation with titanium-mesh patch leads outside intact normal pericardium and directly on the epicardium in 13 open-chest dogs. Talc was then instilled into the pericardial space to stimulate adhesion formation and pericardial thickening. After 3 weeks of recovery, thoracotomy and defibrillation testing were repeated in nine dogs with the patch leads outside the thickened, adherent pericardium. There were no significant differences in defibrillation energy requirements between locations (p greater than 0.10). In addition, a comparison of electrical impedance measurements at 10 joules showed no significant differences (p greater than 0.30). In this animal model, defibrillation energy requirements were not altered by positioning the patch leads outside normal intact pericardium rather than placing them directly on the epicardium. Furthermore, thickened, adherent pericardium interposed between the patch leads and the heart does not increase defibrillation energy requirements. These data suggest that placement of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator patch leads outside the pericardium in patients (including those with pericardial adhesions from previous cardiac operations) will not adversely affect defibrillation efficacy and thus can simplify the implantation procedure.\r"

Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis. To assess the results of surgical treatment, we reviewed our 40-year experience. Methods: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed. Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05. Results: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median, 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases. Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade. Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32, 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23, 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18, 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17, 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14, 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13, 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11, 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4, 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3, 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); and other types (n = 12, 9%). Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%). Local recurrence developed in 27%. Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42, synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90, 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59, 10%). Overall 5-year survival was 66%. Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%, p less than 0.0001). Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic. Conclusions: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities. Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas, but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acids aspartate and glutamate, in combination, were evaluated as a means of reducing infarct size and improving cardiac function during reperfusion in an intact pig having an acute anteroseptal infarct. Three groups of 6 pigs each were randomly studied in a blinded manner: control (no amino acids), aspartate/glutamate 3 mmol/L, and aspartate/glutamate 13 mmol/L. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded distal to its first diagonal branch for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 6 hours. Aspartate and glutamate were administered systemically immediately before reperfusion. The following parameters were measured: infarct size and percent area at risk, global metabolic function, global and regional myocardial function, and tissue parameters of metabolic function. The results clearly showed a significant decrease in infarct size from 60% of the area at risk in control pigs to 37% in both 3 mmol/L and 13 mmol/L amino acid groups. Cardiac output, coronary blood flow, and global oxygen consumption were not significantly affected by the use of amino acids relative to the control group. Global left ventricular mechanical function was also not adversely affected by the infarct and was not altered by amino acid administration. Regional function, however, was significantly decreased by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in all groups to near 20% and only significantly recovered to 64% in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group. Adenosine triphosphate and acetyl coenzyme A measurements documented significant increases in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group relative to the control group. The conclusions of this study strongly support aspartate/glutamate supplementation for stunned, reperfused myocardium. It is apparent that the effect of amino acid supplementation on glycolysis is directly translated into improved regional function and reduced infarct size.\r"

Isolated canine hearts (n = 25) were exposed to 60 minutes of warm (37 degrees C) global ischemia after the arrest by crystalloid cardioplegia. Prostaglandin analog was given in three different ways: preadministration (700 ng/kg body weight per minute) before ischemia for 30 minutes (group I, n = 5), given as a component of cardioplegic solution (600 ng/ml, group II, n, = 6), and post-administration (25 ng/kg body weight per minute) during reperfusion for 30 minutes (group III, n = 7). During reperfusion, coronary sinus blood flow, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in coronary sinus blood, and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured during reperfusion. As a result, groups II and III showed significantly better global left ventricular function (developed pressure, maximum dP/dt, and diastolic compliance) than the control group (without prostaglandin analog, n = 7) and group I. Myocardial oxygen consumption at reperfusion (1 minute) was significantly larger in group II than in the control group. 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha flux was significantly larger in group II than in the other three groups during reperfusion. The results indicated that prostaglandin analog has a beneficial effect on myocardial protection under global ischemia with cardioplegia, particularly when used as a component of cardioplegic solution and also during reperfusion. The mechanism may relate to the cytoprotective effect (including protection of endothelium with enhanced endogenous prostacyclin production at reperfusion and also to the modulation of reperfusion per se.\r"

From June 1974 through December 1976, 253 Hancock I bioprostheses (150 mitral and 103 aortic) were inserted in 220 selected patients who survived the operation and had follow-up until June 1989 (mean follow-up 13.5 years, with an accumulative follow-up of 2956.4 patient-years). One hundred seventeen patients had mitral valve replacement, 70 had aortic valve replacement, and 33 had combined mitral and aortic valve replacement. There were 27 thromboembolic events. The probability of being free from thromboembolism at 14 years was 81.0% +/- 7.4% for the mitral valve replacement group, 85.4% +/- 6.7% for the aortic group, and 67.1% +/- 18.4% for the mitral-aortic group. Fifteen episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred. There were 10 instances of nonstructural dysfunction (paravalvular leaks) in seven mitral valves (4.6%) and in three aortic valves (2.9%). One hundred twenty-two bioprostheses in 106 patients resulted in structural deterioration. The probability of freedom from structural deterioration at 14 years was 37.2% +/- 3.9% for the mitral group, 43.9% +/- 7.1% for the aortic group, and 30.1% +/- 8.9% for the mitral-aortic group. The logistic regression analysis between age at the time of operation and bioprosthetic life (structural deterioration-free period) demonstrates a linear regression curve (r = 0.53). There were 56 late deaths (27 patients died at reoperation). The actuarial survival rate (including hospital mortality) at 14 years was 57.2% +/- 5.4% for the entire series, with no statistically significant difference between groups. The probability of remaining free from valve-related morbidity and mortality at 14 years was 16.7% +/- 4.8% for the mitral group, 20.8% +/- 6.2% for the aortic group, and 14.0% +/- 7.0% for the mitral-aortic group. The long-term results of this series show that the clinical performance of the Hancock I porcine valve appears satisfactory during the first 6 years. The behavior of this bioprosthesis at 14 years' follow-up changes drastically, because only a minor group of patients is free from valve-related complications, justifying the restriction of its use for selected patients.\r"

Aortic valve replacement was performed in 90 patients, mitral valve replacement in 118, and double valve replacement in 16 patients. One patient had tricuspid valve replacement. There were 100 female patients and 125 male patients with a mean age of 54 years (range 2 to 71 years). Present data were completely available for all patients. The cumulative follow-up was 541 patient-years with a mean of 2 years, 5 months. The closing date for follow-up was July 1989, and the closing interval was 2 months. The early mortality rate was 3.1%, and the late mortality rate, 3.1%. The 5-year survival rate was 88% +/- 2.0%: 87% +/- 3.0% for aortic valve replacement, 91% +/- 3.3% for mitral valve replacement, and 75% +/- 9.6% for double valve replacement. The actuarial rates of freedom from thromboembolism at 5 years were 93% +/- 3.2% for aortic, 96% +/- 1.4% for mitral, and 94% +/- 6.1% for double valve replacement. There were no instances of structural valve deterioration. Actuarial rate of freedom from valve-related morbidity and mortality was 86% +/- 2.0% at 5 years: 86% +/- 9.5% for aortic, 87% +/- 3.3% for mitral, and 75% +/- 7.3% for double valve replacement. Effective valve areas (average) of 12 mitral and 12 aortic valve prostheses were calculated at rest and during bicycle exercise: 2.4 cm2 at rest and 2.8 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm aortic valves, 2.4 cm2 at rest and 3.0 cm2 during exercise in 25 mm aortic valves, 2.0 cm2 at rest and 2.4 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm mitral valves, and 2.6 cm2 at rest and 2.5 cm2 during exercise in 29 mm mitral valve. On the basis of our follow-up period of 5 years, we have judged the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve reliable, with a low incidence of valve-related morbidity and with acceptably satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics at rest and during exercise.\r"

Patients selected to receive adjuvant irradiation were those for whom there was doubt as to the completeness of surgical resection. Overall 5-year survival and locoregional control after brachytherapy were 65% and 54%, respectively. Locoregional control was similar for tumors treated at initial diagnosis (12 patients), at the time of recurrence (13 patients), or for tumors that were metastatic to the chest wall (five patients). Six patients with tumors larger than 10 cm in maximum dimension had a locoregional recurrence rate of 69% versus a recurrence rate of 39% for 18 patients with smaller tumors (p = 0.27). Fifty-four percent of high-grade tumors recurred locoregionally versus 28% of low-grade tumors (p = 0.37). Bone invasion or the presence of positive resection margins was not clearly associated with a higher locoregional failure rate. Only one patient (1/28; 7%) was known to have had recurrence within the irradiated area. Eight patients (8/28; 37%) had recurrence adjacent to the implanted area, and the precise failure site could not be determined for the remaining two patients. Because of the relatively high risk of regional versus in-field recurrence, patients with chest wall sarcoma who receive adjuvant treatment should be treated primarily with external-beam irradiation to allow more generous coverage of the tumor bed. Brachytherapy could be used as a tumor bed \"boost\" treatment. In patients undergoing resection of recurrent tumor in a previously irradiated site, adjuvant brachytherapy, without external-beam irradiation, should be considered to reduce the risk of extensive soft tissue necrosis.\r"

Postoperative respiratory course was monitored by serial clinical assessments, chest x-ray examination, arterial blood gases, sputa bacterial cultures, and the patient's requirement and response to chest physiotherpy. The two groups were similarly matched in age (mean 58.5 years), smoking habits, pulmonary functions, and surgical procedures. Postoperative pulmonary complications of collapse/consolidation developed in 11 patients (two in group A and nine in group B) (p less than 0.03). Four patients (all in group B) required nimitracheotomy in addition to antibiotics and chest physiotherapy to treat their pneumonia. Chest physiotherapy requirement was less in group A than in group B, with a mean number of sessions of seven in group A and eight in group B and a mean total time of 92 minutes in group A and 112 minutes in group B. The mean duration of minitracheotomy was 4.13 days. Minor temporary symptoms resulted from the minitracheotomy in eight patients (42%) and included discomfort, voice changes, subcutaneous emphysema, and stridor. There was one case of long-term morbidity (5%)-skin scarring from wound infection at the site of the minitracheotomy. No postoperative deaths resulted. We conclude that the prophylactic use of minitracheotomy is safe and effective in decreasing postoperative respiratory complications in patients undergoing lung resections.\r"

Of those patients, 65 underwent conventional lateral thoracotomy, and 35 patients had median sternotomy. No significant difference existed in actuarial survival after the first operation to remove the metastases between the two patients groups. Furthermore, local excision of 418 lesions was performed in 25 patients with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Of those, 18 patients had undergone a one-stage operation for bilateral lesions through a median sternotomy approach. Although our study was not randomized, survival of the 25 patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser tends to be longer than survival of the 75 patients for whom the Nd:YAG laser was not used. We concluded that aggressive excision and evaporation of multiple lung metastases with the Nd:YAG laser under median sternotomy is a safe and promising variation in technique and that this approach will expand the scope of surgical indications for metastatic lung tumors. For a clearer demonstration of the influence of differences in surgical techniques on long-term survival it is necessary to conduct randomized prospective studies of the surgical techniques.\r"

Therefore the pulmonary capillaries of 18 Large White pigs aged less than 10 minutes, 1 week, and 6 months (six animals at each age) were perfused with cationized ferritin and the peroxidase conjugated lectins Dolichos bifloris, concanavalin A, Triticum vulgaris, and Ricinus communis type 2. Lectins bind to the carbohydrate cell surface antigen for which each shows monosaccharide specificity. The ultrastructural localization of each substance on the capillary endothelial cell was studied, and the length of labeled cell membrane was measured. The proportion of intracellular vesicles containing cationized ferritin was also determined. Binding of cationized ferritin to cell membrane and the number of cationized ferritin-labeled vesicles decreased between birth and 1 week (p less than 0.01 for both). Binding of lectins Triticum vulgaris and Dolichos bifloris decreased between birth and 1 week (p less than 0.01 for both) and between 1 week and adulthood (p less than 0.01 for Dolichos bifloris). Binding of concanavalin A and Ricinus communis type 2 showed a nonsignificant increase with age. Thus the area of pulmonary endothelial cell membrane and the proportion of vesicles with a negative charge decreased after birth, and the distribution of cell surface glycoconjugates also changed. Because these microdomains form differentiated pathways that help control transcellular movement of water and solutes, the findings help explain the greater permeability of the newborn lung.\r"

Palliative operations were performed on 154 occasions in 121 patients (63%). Survival after a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt (n = 57) and banding of the pulmonary trunk (n = 35) was comparable (84% and 77% at 1 year, 62% and 45% at 5 years), but those who underwent repair of aortic arch obstruction fared worse (n = 18, 44% and 22% at 1 and 5 years, p less than 0.001). The remainder did not undergo an operation because of balanced physiology (n = 17, 9% of entire group), complex anatomy (n = 32, 15%), or irreversible low output (n = 19, 12%). Palliative surgery, overall, had a deleterious effect on immediate survival (greater than 1 month relative risk 6.6, p less than 0.001), but, in the survivors, medium-term outcome was improved (greater than 6 months, 0.68, p less than 0.05). This effect was most marked for those undergoing a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt (less than 1 month, 2.52; greater than 6 months, 0.43); by contrast, after banding of the pulmonary trunk, with or without additional repair of the aortic arch repair, medium-term risk was not altered (greater than 6 months, 1.13 and 0.91, respectively). These data will assist the clinician in making decisions concerning the management of infants with double-inlet ventricle and in the judicious use of palliative surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The fate of 191 infants with double-inlet ventricle was studied to determine the influence of morphologic characteristics at presentation and subsequent management on the potential for, and timing of, definitive repair by the Fontan operation or ventricular septation. At presentation, 136 patients (71%) were potential candidates for a Fontan procedure. Actuarial survival was better than for those deemed unsuitable for either definitive option (n = 55; 68% versus 28% at 1 year; p less than 0.001), but still, only 78 patients (57%) were known to be alive and suitable candidates at 2 years of age. This was largely due to death after presentation with low cardiac output (n = 19) and at palliative operation (20 of 98 surgically treated patients). The adverse events of late sudden death (n = 14) and the development of new features precluding a Fontan operation (n = 18) mostly occurred before 4 years of age (n = 22). Patients requiring no operation and those who underwent a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt fared better than those who underwent isolated banding of the pulmonary trunk (9/13 and 25/42 alive and suitable versus 14/33; p less than 0.05), and than those who required aortic arch repair together with banding (1/12; p less than 0.01), because of the development of subaortic stenosis in the latter group. In contrast, only 43 patients (23% of all 191 patients) had morphologic features that were additionally compatible with future ventricular septation. Actuarial survival free of adverse events for these 43 patients was similar to that of the 136 patients considered suitable for a Fontan operation. Thus management in infancy must be aimed at maintaining potential for a future Fontan operation, which itself should not be delayed, for most patients, beyond 3 years of age, because of the prevalence of adverse events with increasing age.\r"

However, schemes which require post-booster testing may present practical difficulties. We applied a random-effects regression model to data from 118 Senegalese infants given three injections of hepatitis B vaccine about 6 weeks apart and a booster injection at 13 months, and show that revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-HBs titre recorded at the time of the booster dose. We also show that titre-at-booster is no less accurate in predicting future titre than 1-month post-booster titre. In several other studies the post-booster decline in anti-HBs conforms to the same mathematical description, indicating the generality of our findings.\r"

In 2 of the 3 subjects, before hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, there was a defect in suppressor-inducer T lymphocytes specifically controlling immune responses to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, an antigen expressed on the hepatocyte surface. In these 2 subjects, specific helper T cells and antibodies to the asialoglycoprotein receptor persisted and increased after acute hepatitis A, and autoimmune CAH type 1 developed within 5 months. Thus, in susceptible individuals HAV is a trigger for autoimmune CAH.\r"

A study of diet and breast cancer was done among 200 Singapore Chinese women with histologically confirmed disease and 420 matched controls. A quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess intakes of selected nutrients and foods 1 year before interview. Daily intakes were computed and risk analysed after adjustment for concomitant risk factors. In premenopausal women, high intakes of animal proteins and red meat were associated with increased risk. Decreased risk was associated with high intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), beta-carotene, soya proteins, total soya products, a high PUFA to saturated fatty acid ratio, and a high proportion of soya to total protein. In multiple analysis, the variables which were significant after adjustment for each other were red meat (p less than 0.001) as a predisposing factor, and PUFA (p = 0.02), beta-carotene (p = 0.003), and soya protein (p = 0.02) as protective factors. The analysis of dietary variables in postmenopausal women gave uniformly non-significant results. Our finding that soya products may protect against breast cancer in younger women is of interest since these foods are rich in phyto-oestrogens.\r"

  ".U": "91218587\r", 
  ".W": "From April 17 to May 1, 1989, gastroenteritis developed in about 900 people during a visit to a new resort in Arizona, USA. Of 240 guests surveyed, 110 had a gastrointestinal illness that was significantly associated with the drinking of tap water from the resort's well (relative risk = 16.1, 95% confidence interval 14.5 to 17.8) and this risk increased significantly with the number of glasses of water consumed (p less than 0.005). Three of seven paired sera tested for antibodies to the Norwalk agent had a four-fold or greater rise in titre. Water contaminated with faecal coliforms was traced back to the deep water well, which remained contaminated even after prolonged pumping. Effluent from the resort's sewage treatment facility seeped through fractures in the subsurface rock (with little filtration) directly into the resort's deep well. Although the latest technology was used to design the resort's water and sewage treatment plants, the region's unique geological conditions posed unexpected problems that may trouble developers faced with similar subsurface geological formations and arid climatic conditions in many parts of the world. In these areas, novel solutions are needed to provide adequate facilities for the treatment of sewage and supply of pure drinking water.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The traditional predictors of the outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation--minute ventilation (VE) and maximal inspiratory pressure (Plmax)--are frequently inaccurate. We developed two new indexes: the first quantitates rapid shallow breathing as the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), and the second is termed CROP, because it integrates thoracic compliance, respiratory rate, arterial oxygenation, and Plmax. METHODS. The threshold values for each index that discriminated best between a successful and an unsuccessful outcome of weaning were determined in 36 patients, and the predictive accuracy of these values was then tested prospectively in an additional 64 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and the data were also analyzed with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, in which the proportions of true positive results and false positive results are plotted against each other for a number of threshold values of an index; the area under the curve reflects the accuracy of the index. RESULTS. Sensitivity was highest for Plmax (1.00), followed closely by the f/VT ratio (0.97). Specificity was highest for the f/VT ratio (0.64) and lowest for Plmax (0.11). The f/VT ratio was the best predictor of successful weaning, and Plmax and the f/VT ratio were the best predictors of failure. The area under the ROC curve for the f/VT ratio (0.89) was larger than that under the curves for the CROP index (0.78, P less than 0.05), Plmax (0.61, P less than 0.001), and VE (0.40, P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Rapid shallow breathing, as reflected by the f/VT ratio, was the most accurate predictor of failure, and its absence the most accurate predictor of success, in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.\r"

  ".U": "91218812\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome is an infrequent life-threatening complication of marrow or organ transplantation that is the consequence of profound immunosuppression. The results of treatment have been disappointing, although a small number of patients have been cured by chemoradiotherapy or antiviral agents after a reduction in the dosage of immunosuppressive therapy. We report here the results of treating this disorder with anti-B-cell antibodies. METHODS. Twenty-six patients in whom aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome developed after bone marrow (n = 14) or organ (n = 12) transplantation received 0.2 mg of CD21-specific and of CD24-specific antibodies per kilogram of body weight for 10 consecutive days in an open, prospective, multicenter trial. RESULTS. The treatment was well tolerated. All patients had transient neutropenia, apparently because the CD24 molecule is also expressed on granulocytes. The treatment was ineffective in seven patients with monoclonal B-cell proliferation. In contrast, 16 patients with oligoclonal B-cell proliferation had complete remission. Systemic remission also occurred in two other patients with oligoclonal proliferation who had central nervous system involvement, although they subsequently died because of progression of the central nervous system disease. In one patient who died early, clonality was not determined. Of the 16 patients who had complete remission, 2 with persistent immunodeficiency due to graft (marrow) rejection or acute graft-versus-host disease had a relapse, and the 1 with graft-versus-host disease subsequently died. Eleven patients were alive and disease-free after a median follow-up of 35 months (5 of 14 marrow recipients and 6 of 12 organ recipients). Four other patients in complete remission died of unrelated causes 4 to 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous administration of anti-B-cell antibodies may be effective in controlling diffuse, severe, oligoclonal B-cell proliferation not involving the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The natural course of adult hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related membranous nephropathy in areas where HBV infection is endemic (characterized by vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV in early childhood) has not been fully defined. METHODS. We evaluated the clinical features, pathological findings, serologic profiles, therapeutic responses, and prognoses of 21 patients with adult-onset HBV-related membranous nephropathy. The patients were followed for a mean of 60 months (range, 12 to 108). Only patients with evidence of glomerular capillary deposition of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in a renal-biopsy specimen were included. RESULTS. The clinical features and serologic studies suggested that the patients had acquired chronic HBV infection in early childhood; moreover, other causes of membranous nephropathy had been excluded. All were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen and had high titers of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen at first clinical presentation. HBeAg was detected in the serum of 17 patients (81 percent), yet only 3 had even slightly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. The clinical response to therapy with interferon alfa was disappointing; only one of the five patients treated had a complete remission with seroconversion to antibody to HBeAg. Contrary to reports of studies in children, spontaneous remission of the nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria was uncommon in the adults with HBV-related membranous nephropathy whom we studied. Proteinuria and HBV antigenemia persisted in untreated patients. During the follow-up period, 29 percent of the patients had progressive renal failure and 10 percent required maintenance dialysis therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The course of HBV-related membranous nephropathy in adults in areas where HBV is endemic is not benign. Regardless of treatment, the disease has a slowly but relentlessly progressive clinical course in approximately one third of patients.\r"

  ".U": "91218814\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Gaucher's disease, the most prevalent of the sphingolipid storage disorders, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase). Enzyme replacement was proposed as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder in 1966. To assess the clinical effectiveness of this approach, we infused macrophage-targeted human placental glucocerebrosidase (60 IU per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks for 9 to 12 months) into 12 patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease who had intact spleens. The frequency of infusions was increased to once a week in two patients (children) during part of the trial because they had clinically aggressive disease. RESULTS. The hemoglobin concentration increased in all 12 patients, and the platelet count in 7. Serum acid phosphatase activity decreased in 10 patients during the trial, and the plasma glucocerebroside level in 9. Splenic volume decreased in all patients after six months of treatment, and hepatic volume in five. Early signs of skeletal improvements were seen in three patients. The enzyme infusions were well tolerated, and no antibody to the exogenous enzyme developed. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous administration of macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase produces objective clinical improvement in patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease. The hematologic and visceral responses to enzyme replacement develop more rapidly than the skeletal response.\r"

They include resuscitation and triage before hospitalization, the use of designated trauma centers, resuscitation by trauma teams, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring, comprehensive pediatric intensive care, the use of objective measures of outcome, and improved rehabilitation programs (Templeton JM: personal communication). The treatment of individual cases is based on simple but well-established principles. The key steps in management are to recognize children with life-threatening injuries (on the basis of the mechanism of injury or a Pediatric Trauma Score less than or equal to 8 or a Revised Trauma Score less than or equal to 11), to support the function of vital organs by establishing and maintaining adequate respiratory gas exchange and circulation, and to identify all important injuries by thorough and ongoing assessment.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with scotomas or blind-spots in their visual field resulting from damage to the visual pathways often report that the pattern from the rest of the visual field 'fills in' to occupy the scotoma. Here we describe a novel technique for generating an artificial perceptual scotoma which enabled us to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of this filling-in process. A homogeneous grey square subtending 1.5 degrees was displayed against a background of twinkling two-dimensional noise of equal mean luminance. On steady eccentric fixation for 10 s the square vanished and was filled in by the twinkling noise from the surround. Using this display we found that 'filling in' is an active visual process that probably involves creating an actual neural representation of the surround rather than merely ignoring the absence of information from the scotoma; filling in can occur separately for colour and texture, suggesting separate mechanisms; the filling-in process does not completely suppress information from the scotoma, even after an image has faded completely from consciousness it can nevertheless contribute to motion perception; and the process can be strongly influenced by illusory contours.\r"

Most epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be mimicked by synthetic peptides of 12-15 amino acids. Although in specific cases, truncations of peptides improves sensitization of target cells, no optimum length for binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules has been defined. We have now analysed synthetic peptide captured by empty MHC class I molecules of the mutant cell line RMA-S. We found that class I molecules preferentially bound short peptides (nine amino acids) and selectively bound these peptides even when they were a minor component in a mixture of longer peptides. These results may help to explain the difference in size restriction of T-cell epitopes between experiments with synthetic peptides and those with naturally processed peptides.\r"

  ".W": "CD43 (sialophorin, leukosialin, leukocyte large sialoglycoprotein), a heavily sialylated molecule found on most leukocytes and platelets, was initially identified as a major glycoprotein of mouse, rat and human T cells. CD43 expression is defective on the T cells of males with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X chromosome-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder. Affected males are susceptible to opportunistic infections and do not respond to polysaccharide antigens, reflecting defects in cytotoxic and helper T-cell functions. Anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies have a modest costimulatory effect on T cells, natural killer cells, B cells and monocytes, and one such antibody has been shown to activate T cells directly. To investigate a possible physiological role for CD43, a complementary DNA encoding the human protein was introduced into an antigen-responsive murine T-cell hybridoma. We observed that CD43 enhances the antigen-specific activation of T cells and that the intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell activation, is required for this function. We also found that antigen-presenting cells can bind specifically to immobilized purified CD43 and that the binding can be inhibited by liposomes containing CD43 as well as by anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) differs in T lymphocytes and macrophages. In T cells, HIV transcription is poorly detected in vivo. Cloned, normal T lymphocytes show very little, if any, basal activity of the HIV enhancer and low nuclear expression of NF-kappa B, a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV enhancer. In contrast, fixed tissue macrophages express detectable HIV proteins, indicating permanent virus transcription. One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in macrophages could be sustained nuclear NF-kappa B expression. However, the U937 monocytic cell line, which is fully permissive to HIV replication, is known to express only low levels of nuclear NF-kappa B. We show here that chronic HIV infection results in both induction of a nuclear factor with antigenic properties indistinguishable from those of NF-kappa B and permanently increased HIV enhancer activity. This phenomenon, which is independent of tumour necrosis factor, is associated with HIV replication, and is thus likely to explain at least in part the perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91218851\r", 
  ".W": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, cell-cell communication is required to form a simple pattern of sensory ray neurons and cuticular structures (alae). The C. elegans pal-1 gene initiates one developmental pathway (ray lineages) simply by blocking a cell-cell interaction that induces an alternative pathway. Here we show by mosaic analysis that pal-1+ acts by preventing specific cells from responding to inductive signals. The results indicate that although cell signals play a critical role in generating this pattern, they do not provide spatial information. Instead, signals are sent to many, if not all, of the precursor cells, and the ability to respond is spatially restricted. This patterning strategy thus differs from many well known models for pattern formation in which localized inductive signals influence a subset of cells within a field. We find that pal-1 encodes a homeodomain protein and so is likely to regulate transcription. The pal-1+ protein could block the response to cell signals either by repressing genes involved in signal transduction or by acting directly on downstream genes in a way that neutralizes the effects of the intercellular signals. Genetic experiments indicate that one candidate for such a downstream gene is the Antennapedia-like homeotic selector gene mab-5.\r"

  ".W": "The ends or telomeres of the linear chromosomes of eukaryotes are composed of tandem repeats of short DNA sequences, one strand being rich in guanine (G strand) and the complementary strand in cytosine. Telomere synthesis involves the addition of telomeric repeats to the G strand by telomere terminal transferase (telomerase). Telomeric G-strand DNAs from a variety of organisms adopt compact structures, the most stable of which is explained by the formation of G-quartets. Here we investigate the capacity of the different folded forms of telomeric DNA to serve as primers for the Oxytricha nova telomerase in vitro. Formation of the K(+)-stabilized G-quartet structure in a primer inhibits its use by telomerase. Furthermore, the octanucleotide T4G4, which does not fold, is a better primer than (T4G4)2, which can form a foldback structure. We conclude that telomerase does not require any folding of its DNA primer. Folding of telomeric DNA into G-quartet structures seems to influence the extent of telomere elongation in vitro and might therefore act as a negative regulator of elongation in vivo.\r"

For each patient, the scans of the anophthalmic and contralateral normal orbit were compared. In the anophthalmic orbits, the anatomy was optimally restored in those with a primary implant, and suboptimal results were achieved in the orbits with a secondary implant. The greatest differences were noticed in the orbits without an implant. Differences were noticed for the position and length of the superior muscle complex and the inferior rectus muscle, the position of the upper eyelid, the depth of the superior sulcus, and the backward tilt of the prosthesis. The authors conclude that the rotatory displacement of the orbital contents after enucleation, which explains the sequelae of the anophthalmic orbit, is grossly circumvented by the insertion of an implant. In achieving this effect, primary implants are better than secondary ones.\r"

Multiple, bilateral patches of CHRPE have been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. This finding is thought to be a sensitive and specific clinical marker for these conditions and useful for predicting the presence and development of colorectal polyposis. Our findings provide further evidence that familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, and Turcot syndrome may be related conditions representing the variable phenotypic expression of a single, autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Children and young adults with multiple patches of CHRPE and a family history of adenomatous polyposis may be at increased risk for the development of central nervous system tumors as well as gastrointestinal polyps.\r"

Other significant factors were the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P less than 0.01) and respiratory distress syndrome (P less than 0.01). An additional factor observed to be significant for the development of severe ROP (stages III-V) was sepsis (P less than 0.01). Race and maternal history of substance abuse were not found to be significant factors. The unusually high incidence (72%) of ROP in low birth weight infants found in this study may be due to limited prenatal care and other maternal factors such as inadequate nutrition.\r"

In 8 hypertensive eyes, the mean IOP of 51 mmHg was lowered acutely to 15 mmHg with a needle placed in the anterior chamber. In 12 normotensive eyes, the mean IOP of 16 mmHg was similarly increased to 45 mmHg. Simultaneous stereophotographs were taken both before and within 15 minutes after the IOP change. The surface of normotensive optic nerve heads moved posteriorly a mean of 17.8 microns after IOP elevation (P less than 0.02). The surface of hypertensive optic nerve heads moved anteriorly 47.4 microns after IOP lowering (P = 0.1); this change was significantly less in nerve heads with larger and deeper cups (P less than 0.02). Significant changes were not detected in disc diameter or vein diameter with acute changes in IOP. Measurable shifts in the position of the optic nerve head surface when IOP is altered may provide a future prognostic test for glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\r"

The first is that the optic discs and nerve fiber layer defects were produced by abnormal diurnal levels of ocular pressures or levels of ocular pressure, although less than 21 mmHg, which may be abnormal for the optic disc.

Only 9.1% of the glaucomatous group fell within the 95% prediction interval for the normal group, indicating a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for predicting the presence of visual field loss. Discs associated with mild field loss could be discriminated from those associated with moderate or severe field loss on the basis of disc and rim area measurements.\r"

There was no statistically significant relation detected between axon count and scleral canal area. Multiple regression revealed that when corrected for the effect of age, eyes with smaller scleral canal areas had larger number of axons.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the relation between diurnal variations of intraocular pressure (IOP) and prognosis for glaucomatous visual field damage. The association between apparent progressive loss of visual field and the occurrence of IOP peaks was studied. Pressure peaks were detected by a self-tonometer in the natural environment of patients with glaucoma. The study groups consisted of patients with and without a strong indication of progressive visual field losses, all with IOPs of 22 mm Hg or less obtained in the ophthalmologist's office. Patients apparently undergoing progressive visual field loss were found to have significantly more frequent IOP peaks than patients with stable visual fields. A statistical evaluation indicated that, in a population with a 30% prevalence of progressive loss of visual field, 75% of the patients with peaks have progressive loss and 75% of those without peaks do not have visual field progression. Intraocular pressure peaks were thus shown to have an association with the apparent progression of vision loss independent of the mean IOP. Home tonometry appeared to be a promising tool for identifying patients at increased risk of developing visual field loss who may require intensified follow-up and an alteration in clinical management. However, the present study must be complemented by a prospective study.\r"

The time between tests was approximately 1 year. Using the manufacturer's standard for a reliable field (false-positive and false-negative rates, less than 33%; fixation losses, less than 20%), no trends in the proportion of reliable fields or the component indices were observed over time. Four percent of normal subjects, 9% of those with ocular hypertension, and 8% of patients with glaucoma were unable to meet the reliability standard every time they were tested. This repeated lack of reliability was due almost exclusively to fixation losses. However, patients with glaucoma were more likely to have repeatedly high false-negative responses than those with ocular hypertension or normal subjects, providing further evidence that false-negative responses are more indicative of glaucoma than of patient reliability.\r"

It was found that technical artifacts caused nearly half of the instances in which a field examination had a reported fixation loss rate of greater than 20%. It was also found that the perimetrist can prevent the artifacts, with the result that the frequency of field examinations labeled as having excessive fixation loss fell from 26% to 14%.\r"

Frequency-of-seeing curves were constructed to obtain accurate estimates of threshold and intratest variability. Although location did not have a significant effect on intratest variability in conventional perimetry, intratest variability increased with threshold (P = 0.031) and age (P = 0.012). The results with resolution perimetry contrasted sharply and showed that neither threshold, age, nor location had a significant effect on intratest variability (P greater than 0.225). Although the thresholds with the two types of perimetry were correlated, intratest variability was not. These results show that resolution perimetry may be able to bypass some of the limitations encountered in obtaining thresholds with conventional perimetry, thereby providing more reliable information.\r"

Results of cytologic examination of the vitreous of the right eye showed neoplastic cells characteristic of large cell type malignant lymphoma. Shortly thereafter, cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid also showed large cell malignant lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass involving the left cerebellar hemisphere. After bilateral whole-eye radiation therapy, there was complete resolution of the lymphomatous retinochoroidal infiltrates in both eyes.

Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent bacterial etiologies; however, combinations of numerous facultative and anaerobic organisms have also been isolated. Involvement of the face and periocular region is rare. A case is presented here, as well as a review of the clinical features of 15 other patients previously described, in whom eyelid necrosis due to periorbital necrotizing fasciitis developed. Early surgical debridement and drainage of necrotic tissues and appropriate parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy. The mortality rate in patients with periorbital spread was 12.5%, with the prognosis known to be adversely affected by delay in diagnosis and treatment and/or extension of infection from the face to the neck. Reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts was necessary in most cases to avoid such complications as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malpositions, and lagophthalmos.\r"

Nine patients (14 eyes) were treated who had pseudotumor with optic nerve sheath fenestration, in whom automated perimetry was used as a major parameter in the decision to undertake surgery and in evaluating the results. Visual field results demonstrated significant improvement in this group of patients. Seven of 8 eyes with total loss less than 1500 dB had improvement or no further deterioration. Using results of the last preoperative examination as baseline, it was found that six of the eight had improvement over 150 dB. In one patient, a slight deterioration occurred postoperatively. Those eyes with total loss above 1500 dB demonstrated stabilization of fields postoperatively. Statistical analysis of total loss preoperatively and postoperatively for this group of patients demonstrated significant improvement for five of the six comparisons investigated. Average preoperative total loss and average postoperative total loss were not significantly different. Comparisons of results of the last preoperative examination to those of the first postoperative and most recent follow-up examinations, and evaluation of average total loss postoperatively showed significant improvement had occurred. Results of the first postoperative examination and those of the most recent follow-up examination showed significant improvement from the average preoperative total loss.\r"

High-frequency ultrasound transducers (50-100 MHz) have been developed and incorporated into a clinical B-scan device capable of producing images in the living human eye to a depth of approximately 4 mm at an axial and lateral resolution approaching 20 microns. Clinical use of this instrument is no more difficult than conventional immersion ultrasonography. The authors' results in a series of 14 clinical cases have shown that this method can provide information unavailable from any other imaging technique. Anterior segment tumors difficult to define with conventional ultrasound can be measured and the extent of invasion determined. Differentiation of tissue on the basis of internal acoustic characteristics is aided by the very fine backscatter speckle patterns at these frequencies. Pathology behind anterior segment opacities can be imaged in detail and the ability to image angle structures in cross-section allows a new quantitative method of gonioscopy. The ability to define the relationship of the iris, posterior chamber, zonules, ciliary body, and lens is potentially helpful in understanding mechanisms of glaucoma. Ocular structures can be measured with increased accuracy. Clinical ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) has shown significant potential as an aid in diagnoses of ocular disease.\r"

The authors studied the IOP variation in 82 NTG suspects, whose IOP was first measured every 2 hours for 24 hours. The following night they were suddenly aroused without any notice and IOP was measured. The diurnal IOP variation of NTG patients was found to be similar to that of the normal population and there was no significant difference in the IOP values at the same time points on the two successive nights. Sleep may have little, if any, influence on diurnal IOP variation in NTG patients.\r"

Problems with the external surface of the graft caused the largest number of graft failures. Grafts for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy with retained posterior chamber lenses had a significantly higher failure rate from rejection and endothelial decompensation, 5.1%, compared with less than 1.0% in keratoconus, Fuchs' dystrophy, or bullous keratopathy with secondary implants (P less than 0.0005).\r"

T cells outnumbered B cells by 2 to 17 times, and macrophages and monocytes by approximately 20 times in all specimens. Biopsies were categorized as \"inflamed\" if a cumulative inflammatory score of cellular staining in the substantia propria with CD4, CD8, and OKM1 monoclonal antibodies was greater than that of control tissues. CD4+ lymphocytes predominated over CD8+ lymphocytes in 5 of 7 inflamed biopsies, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes predominated over CD4+ lymphocytes in 5 of 7 noninflamed biopsies. Lymphoid aggregates were present in five inflamed biopsies, but lacked germinal centers, centrally located B cells, or parafollicular T cells typical of the acute stage of trachoma. CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes also were observed in the epithelium and lumen of Meibomian glands. These observations indicate that the inflammatory infiltrate of the tarsoconjunctiva in the cicatricial stage of trachoma is comprised predominantly of T cells, and suggests that T cells may be involved in the genesis of tarsal thickening and conjunctival scarring seen in the later stages of trachoma.\r"

To determine whether eosinophils degranulate and deposit toxic proteins in orbital histiocytosis X, the authors examined lesions by indirect immunofluorescence for localization of the core granule protein (major basic protein) outside of eosinophils. Four patients with histiocytosis X were studied: three with eosinophilic granuloma and one with Hand-Schuller-Christian disease. Tissue eosinophilia was prominent in all specimens; striking extracellular deposition of eosinophil major basic protein was noted in three patients, and focal deposition was present in the fourth patient. Orbital specimens obtained at autopsy from patients without orbital disease were studied as control specimens; no tissue eosinophilia or deposition of eosinophil major basic protein was observed. These findings indicate that eosinophils likely degranulate in lesions of orbital histiocytosis X and may participate in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma.\r"

The authors prospectively managed five such cases by pars plana vitrectomy and foreign body removal without intraoperative or postoperative retinopexy. Fluid gas exchange was performed in only one case. No attempt was made to create a posterior vitreous detachment in any of the cases. After follow-up, ranging between 8 and 35 months, all cases had attached retinas and chorioretinal adhesion around the foreign body site. None of the cases had preretinal macular fibrosis. Four of the five cases had a best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better. The other, an aphakic 3-year-old patient, was amblyopic. Spontaneous chorioretinal adhesion appears to obviate the need for retinopexy in these selected cases. The avoidance of retinopexy and fluid gas exchange may decrease the risk of retinal detachment and preretinal macular fibrosis.\r"

At the time of diagnosis, their median age was 6 years and the oldest was 18 years. In 20 (77%) cases, the patient volunteered symptoms that prompted the eye examination; the presenting symptoms included leukocoria (9 cases), decreased vision (9 cases), strabismus (4 cases), pain (1 case), floaters (1 case), and no symptoms (2 cases). All of the 26 patients (100%) had unilateral sporadic retinoblastoma. Misdiagnosis before referral was common in these older children with active retinoblastoma. Five patients (19%) had prior vitrectomy for presumed vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis while the retinoblastoma was unsuspected clinically, one patient (4%) had cryotherapy for presumed Coats disease, and one (4%) was observed for 7 months for presumed vitreous hemorrhage. The clinician should seriously consider the possibility of retinoblastoma in children who present with signs of unexplained vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis, even if they are older than 5 years of age.\r"

Based on the variability found at surgery for the insertion-limbus distance, the number of millimeters of recession of the medial rectus from the insertion that would have been necessary to place it at the equator ranged between 3.5 and 8.5 mm in this series, and for the lateral rectus, 3.5 mm to 7.0 mm.

Luminal epithelial cells cultured from milk, which have limited proliferative potential, have now been immortalized by introducing the gene encoding simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen. Infection with a recombinant retrovirus proved to be 50-100 times more efficient than calcium phosphate transfection, and of the 17 cell lines isolated, only 5 passed through a crisis period as characterized by cessation of growth. When characterized by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies, 14 lines showed features of luminal epithelial cells and of these, 7 resembled the common luminal epithelial cell type in the profile of keratins expressed. These cells express keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19 homogeneously and do not express keratin 14 or vimentin; a polymorphic epithelial mucin produced in vivo by luminal cells is expressed heterogeneously and the pattern of fibronectin staining is punctate. Although the cell lines have a reduced requirement for added growth factors, they do not grow in agar or produce tumors in the nude mouse. When the v-Ha-ras oncogene was introduced into two of the cell lines by using a recombinant retrovirus, most of the selected clones senesced, but one entered crisis and emerged after 3 months as a tumorigenic cell line.\r"

  ".W": "The connexins form a family of membrane spanning proteins that assemble into gap junction channels. The biophysical properties of these channels are dependent upon the constituent connexin isoform. To begin identifying the molecular basis for gap junction channel behavior in the human heart, a tissue that expresses connexin43, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant cDNAs of human connexin43 with shortened cytoplasmic tail domains. Premature stop codons were inserted, resulting in proteins corresponding in length to the mammalian isoforms connexin32 and connexin26, which are expressed primarily in liver. All constructs restore intercellular coupling when they are transfected into SKHep1 cells, a human hepatoma line that is communication deficient. Whereas wild-type connexin43 transfectants display two distinct unitary conductance values of about 60 and 100 pS, transfectants expressing the mutant proteins, from which 80 and 138 amino acids have been deleted, exhibit markedly different single-channel properties, with unitary conductance values of about 160 and 50 pS, respectively. Junctional conductance of channels composed of wild-type connexin43 is less voltage-sensitive compared with transfectants expressing wild-type connexin32. However, neither of the connexin43 truncation mutants alters this relative voltage insensitivity. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail domain is an important determinant of the unitary conductance event of gap junction channels but not their voltage dependence. Furthermore, since the mutant connexins are missing several consensus phosphorylation sites, modification of these particular sites may not be required for membrane insertion or assembly of human connexin43 into functional channels.\r"

In vitro, the TNF-producing transfectants were resistant to the secreted TNF and grew at rates similar to those of untransfected cells or transfected cells that did not secrete TNF. However, tumors formed by the TNF-secreting cells in vivo remained much smaller than the nonsecreting (transfected and untransfected) tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth required only relatively low serum levels of TNF, persisted for many weeks, and was independent of T cells since it occurred in nude mice. Growth of the TNF-secreting tumors increased dramatically after treatment with anti-human TNF antibody, indicating that extracellular TNF secreted by the tumor cells was necessary for the tumor inhibition. Severe weight loss characteristic of cachexia only occurred in animals with very high serum TNF levels (250 pg/ml) and could be prevented or reversed by anti-TNF antibody treatment. These data are consistent with the existence of a therapeutic window in which persistent exposure to human TNF can lead to prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of T-cell immunity or severe weight loss and without development of resistant tumor variants.\r"

Monolayer cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells were incubated with aliquots of chromatographic fractions and the inhibition of release of prolactin in vitro was measured by RIA in order to monitor the purification. The hypothalamic tissue extract was separated into 11 fractions by high-performance aqueous size-exclusion chromatography with one fraction showing a 4-fold increase in prolactin release-inhibiting factor (PIF) activity. This material was further purified by semipreparative reversed-phase (RP) HPLC. This process resulted in the separation of two distinct fractions that showed high PIF activity. These were further purified by semipreparative and analytical RP-HPLC to apparent homogeneity as judged by the UV absorbance profiles. Neither of the two peptides showed cross-reactivity with gonadotropin releasing hormone-associated peptide or with somatostatin-14 antibodies. Protein sequence analysis revealed that one of the PIF peptides was Trp-Cys-Leu-Glu-Ser-Ser-Gln-Cys-Gln-Asp-Leu-Ser-Thr-Glu-Ser-Asn-Leu-Leu- Ala-Cys - Ile-Arg-Ala-Cys-Lys-Pro, identical to residues 27-52 of the N-terminal region of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor (corresponding to amino acids 1-26 of the 16-kDa fragment). The sequence of the other PIF was Ala-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Asn-Ala-Thr-Leu-Leu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Ala-Leu-Leu- Leu-Arg - Leu-Val-Gln-Leu-Ala-Gly-Ala-Pro-Glu-Pro-Ala-Glu-Pro-Ala-Gln-Pro-Gly-Val- Tyr, representing residues 109-147 of the vasopressin-neurophysin precursor. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region of POMC had significant PIF activity in vitro.\r"

Long-term effects also have been observed in which embryonic exposure to steroid hormone influences the sexual behavior of adults. The generality of the paradigms that have resulted from this work must be viewed with caution as all of the species studied exhibit a particular reproductive pattern. Here it is shown that in the adult red-sided garter snake, the seasonal androgen peak in the summer has a delayed action (8 months) on the male's readiness to court the next spring following emergence from hibernation. This suggests that the interval between the exposure to and the effects of steroid hormones in adult vertebrates may range from short latencies to long latencies and that the present dichotomy of organizing (permanent) versus activating (transient) effects of steroid hormones may not apply in certain instances.\r"

Moreover, the subtraction model operates optimally at plausible spatiotemporal parameter settings.

Monitoring of POMC processing demonstrated the distinct cleavage specificities of PC1 and PC2, since in the cell lines analyzed (i) PC1 cleaves POMC into corticotropin and beta-lipotropin, (ii) PC2 cleaves POMC into beta-endorphin, an N-terminally extended corticotropin containing the joining peptide, and either alpha MSH or desacetyl-alpha MSH, and (iii) PC2 cleaves POMC at the five pairs of basic residues analyzed, whereas PC1 cleaves two of them preferentially, suggesting that PC2 has a broader spectrum of activity than PC1. These data are consistent with our hypothesis on the physiological role of PC1 and PC2 as distinct proprotein convertases acting alone or together to produce a set of tissue-specific maturation products in the brain and in peripheral tissues.\r"

  ".W": "We report a direct determination of the thermodynamic contribution that DNA single-stranded order makes to DNA duplex formation. By using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent UV absorbance spectroscopy, we have characterized thermodynamically the thermally induced disruption of the 13-mer duplex [d(CGCATGAGTACGC)].[d(GCGTACTCATGCG)] (henceforth called S1.S2) and its component single strands, [d(CGCATGAGTACGC)] (henceforth called S1) and [d(GCGTACTCATGCG)] (henceforth called S2). These spectroscopic and calorimetric measurements yield the following thermodynamic profiles at 25 degrees C: delta G degree = 20.0 kcal/mol, delta H degree = 117.0 kcal/mol, and delta S degree = 325.4 cal.degree-1.mol-1 for duplex melting of S1.S2; delta G degree = 0.45 kcal/mol, delta H degrees = 29.1 kcal/mol, and delta S degree = 96.1 cal.degree-1.mol-1 for single-strand melting of S1; delta G degree = 1.44 kcal/mol, delta H degree = 27.2 kcal/mol, and delta S degree = 86.4 cal.degree-1.mol-1 for single-strand melting of S2 (1 cal = 4.184 J). These data reveal that the two single-stranded structures S1 and S2 are only marginally stable at 25 degrees C, despite exhibiting rather substantial transition enthalpies. This behavior results from enthalpy and entropy contributions of similar magnitudes that compensate each other, thereby giving rise to relatively small free energies of stabilization for the single strands at 25 degrees C. By contrast, the S1.S2 duplex state is very stable at 25 degrees C since the favorable transition entropy associated with duplex disruption (325.4 cal.degree-1.mol-1) is more than compensated for by the extremely large duplex transition enthalpy (117.0 kcal/mol). We also measured directly an enthalpy change (delta H degree) of -56.4 kcal/mol for duplex formation at 25 degrees C using isothermal batch-mixing calorimetry. This duplex formation enthalpy of -56.4 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C is very different in magnitude from the duplex disruption enthalpy of 117.0 kcal/mol measured at 74 degrees C by DSC. Since the DSC measurement reveals the net transition heat capacity change to be close to zero, we interpret this large disparity between the enthalpies of duplex disruption and duplex formation as reflecting differences in the single-stranded structures at 25 degrees C (the initial states in the isothermal mixing experiment) and the single-stranded structures at approximately 80 degrees C (the final states in the DSC experiment).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Both p58 and p56 derived from recombinant plasmids complement the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the cdc7-1 allele. To determine the biochemical function of the CDC7 protein, the CDC7 gene was cloned and polyclonal antibodies were produced against the CDC7 protein. CDC7 immune complexes prepared from yeast with these antibodies phosphorylate histone H1. Kinase activity is thermolabile in strains carrying the cdc7-1 temperature-sensitive mutant allele and is elevated greater than 10-fold in strains carrying plasmids overexpressing either p56 or p58, confirming that the kinase in the immunoprecipitates is the CDC7 gene product. In addition, we show that CDC7 is a phosphoprotein itself. Indirect immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation show that the CDC7 protein is present at relatively high concentrations in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear proteins may be substrates for the CDC7 protein.\r"

The 3' untranslated region (UTR) of protamine 1 mRNA has been reported to control its time of translation. To understand the mechanisms controlling translation of the protamine mRNAs, we have sought to identify cis elements of the 3' UTR of protamine 2 mRNA that are recognized by cytoplasmic factors. From gel retardation assays, two sequence elements are shown to form specific RNA-protein complexes. Protein binding sites of the two complexes were determined by RNase T1 mapping, by blocking the putative binding sites with antisense oligonucleotides, and by competition assays. The sequences of these elements, located between nucleotides + 537 and + 572 in protamine 2 mRNA, are highly conserved among postmeiotic translationally regulated nuclear proteins of the mammalian testis. Two closely linked protein binding sites were detected. UV-crosslinking studies revealed that a protein of about 18 kDa binds to one of the conserved sequences. These data demonstrate specific protein binding to a highly conserved 3' UTR of translationally regulated testicular mRNA.\r"

Thus, IL-7 may have an important regulatory role during the earliest stages of human B-cell ontogeny. The engagement of the surface IL-7 receptors on immature B-cell precursor cells with recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple phosphoproteins, stimulates inositol phospholipid turnover and DNA synthesis, and promotes their clonal proliferation. These effects are (i) specific for rhIL-7, since rhIL-3, rhIL-4, rhIL-5, rhIL-6, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor do not elicit similar activities on IL-7 receptor-positive human pro-B cells; and (ii) mediated by IL-7 receptors, since they are not observed in IL-7 receptor-negative B-lineage lymphoid cell populations. rhIL-7-induced tyrosine phosphorylation on the 35-, 53-, 55-, 62-, 69-, 76-, 94-, 150-, 170-, and 190-kDa substrates as well as rhIL-7-induced stimulation of inositol phospholipid turnover are abrogated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These results demonstrate that the IL-7 receptor on immature human B-cell precursor populations is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine kinase pathway and tyrosine phosphorylation is an important and perhaps mandatory step in the generation of the IL-7 receptor-linked transmembrane signal.\r"

Here we report that at physiological temperature (37 degrees C) \"empty\" class I molecules appear at the cell surface of RMA-S cells where they can be trapped with H-2 antibodies. In the absence of the stabilizing ligand, the class I molecules rapidly alter their conformation but remain at the cell surface as demonstrated with a rabbit antiserum. Such denatured H-2 molecules can also be found on normal wild-type RMA cells. However, their amount is strongly reduced after culture of RMA cells with a class I binding peptide. These findings indicate that empty class I molecules appear at the surface not only on mutant but also on normal cells, suggesting that in normal cells the supply with peptides is limited.\r"

A deletion of 65 amino acids in the first extracellular domain of PVR prevented virus attachment and infection.

A PVR/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 hybrid receptor, expressing the PVR variable domain on a truncated receptor molecule for human rhinovirus 14, was shown to be a functional receptor for poliovirus.

  ".U": "91219420\r", 
  ".W": "Light and dark adaptation of the teleost retina is accompanied by a remarkable morphological rearrangement of the synaptic connections between photoreceptors and second-order neurons: during light adaptation, numerous new neurites, the so-called spinules, arise from the terminal dendrites of horizontal cells invaginating the cone pedicle, and during dark adaptation, these spinules are retracted. The formation of these spinules is paralleled by the appearance of color opponency in horizontal and ganglion cells, which led to the suggestion that these spinules are the site of the inhibitory synapses in the negative feedback loop between cones and horizontal cells. The formation of the spinules in the light and their disappearance in darkness have a time course of minutes and are modulated by the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate, respectively. Neurotransmitters can modulate neuronal processing through a variety of second messengers that activate protein kinases, resulting most commonly in protein phosphorylation. Herein we report that activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters promotes the formation of new horizontal-cell spinules in animals kept in the dark. Partial inhibition of protein kinase C activation with sphingosines prevents the formation of new spinules during light adaptation but does not affect established spinules. The spinule-forming effect of phorbol esters is not mediated by dopaminergic neurons, since the effect is also seen in retinas depleted of dopaminergic neurons. Phorbol esters also initiate the formation of spinules in synaptically isolated horizontal cells, demonstrating that they have a direct action on these cells. In addition, isolated horizontal cells have substrate proteins that are phosphorylated in a protein kinase C-dependent manner.\r"

Homologous regions are found in a number of previously described finger proteins, including mouse Zfp-1 and Xenopus Xfin. We named this region the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB). This domain has the potential to form two amphipathic alpha-helices. Southern blot analysis of \"zoo\" blots suggests that the Kruppel-associated box is highly conserved during evolution.

Five synthetic overlapping peptides (12-30, 24-44, 308-328, 324-344, and 339-364) were studied for their ability to bind 125I-labeled human TSH (hTSH), its isolated alpha and beta subunits, bovine TSH, ovine TSH, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. The human TSHR peptides 12-30 and 324-344 exhibited remarkable binding activity to human, bovine, and ovine TSH and to the beta chain of hTSH. Lower binding activity resided in the adjacent overlapping peptides, probably due to the contribution of the shared overlap to the binding. The specificity of TSH binding to these peptides was confirmed by their inability to bind human luteinizing hormone, human follicle-stimulating hormone, and the alpha chain of hTSH. Thyrotropins did not bind to bovine serum albumin or to peptide controls unrelated to the TSHR system. Furthermore, the binding of hTSH to TSHR peptides 12-30 and 324-344 was almost completely (approximately 90%) inhibited by rabbit antibodies against hTSH but not by antisera against unrelated proteins. It is concluded that the binding of TSH to its receptor involves extensive contacts and that the TSHR peptides 12-30 and 324-344 contain specific binding regions for TSH that might be either independent sites or two faces (subsites) within a large binding site.\r"

The inserted sequence, called Tat1, shows structural features of a transposon. It is flanked by a 5-bp duplication of the target site DNA and has 13-bp inverted repeats at its termini. Two highly homologous elements situated in a different genomic context were isolated from a genomic library. Genomic Southern analysis indicates that there are at least four copies of Tat1 present in the A. thaliana ecotype Columbia genome. Different hybridization patterns are observed with DNAs derived from different ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that the element has moved since the divergence of these ecotypes. In two populations of A. thaliana, linear extrachromosomal Tat1-homologous DNA has been observed. The presented data are consistent with the hypothesis that Tat1 is an active transposable element.\r"

An increase in the fibroblast's membrane capacitance indicated the opening of the \"fusion pore,\" the first aqueous connection between the fusing cells. We show here that the capacitance increase is preceded by a brief current transient, generated as the erythrocyte discharges its membrane potential through the nascent fusion pore. This signal allows one to calculate the pore conductance during the first milliseconds of its existence. The pore conductance jumps from 0 to approximately 150 pS and then grows more gradually over the subsequent tens of milliseconds until growth is arrested. The initial conductance is similar to that of a large ion channel and suggests that the pore is initially only 1-2 nm wide. Hence, we are probably observing events caused by only a small number of hemagglutinin molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Lovastatin (LOV), the drug recently introduced to treat hypercholesteremia, inhibits the synthesis of mevalonic acid. The effects of LOV on the cell cycle progression of the human bladder carcinoma T24 cell line expressing activated p21ras were investigated. At a concentration of 2-10 microM, LOV arrested cells in G1 and also prolonged--or arrested a minor fraction of cells in--the G2 phase of the cell cycle; at a concentration of 50 microM, LOV was cytotoxic. The cytostatic effects were reversed by addition of exogenous mevalonate. Cells arrested in the cycle by LOV were viable for up to 72 hr and did not show any changes in RNA or protein content or chromatin condensation, which would be typical of either unbalanced growth or deep quiescence. The expression of the proliferation-associated nuclear proteins Ki-67 and p105 in these cells was reduced by up to 72% and 74%, respectively, compared with exponentially growing control cells. After removal of LOV, the cells resumed progression through the cycle; they entered S phase asynchronously after a lag of approximately 6 hr. Because mevalonate is essential for the posttranslational modification (isoprenylation) of p21ras, which in turn allows this protein to become attached to the cell membrane, the data suggest that the LOV-induced G1 arrest may be a consequence of the loss of the signal transduction capacity of p21ras. Indeed, while exposure of cells to LOV had no effect on the cellular content of p21ras (detected immunocytochemically), it altered the intracellular location of this protein, causing its dissociation from the cell membrane and translocation toward the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, it is also possible that inhibition of isoprenylation of proteins other than p21ras (e.g., nuclear lamins) by LOV may be responsible for the observed suppression of growth of T24 cells.\r"

  ".U": "91219426\r", 
  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals and oxidative events have been implicated as playing a role in bringing about the changes in cellular function that occur during aging. Brain readily undergoes oxidative damage, so it is important to determine if aging-induced changes in brain may be associated with oxidative events. Previously we demonstrated that brain damage caused by an ischemia/reperfusion insult involved oxidative events. In addition, pretreatment with the spin-trapping compound N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) diminished the increase in oxidized protein and the loss of glutamine synthetase (GS) activity that accompanied ischemia/reperfusion injury in brain. We report here that aged gerbils had a significantly higher level of oxidized protein as assessed by carbonyl residues and decreased GS and neutral protease activities as compared to young adult gerbils. We also found that chronic treatment with the spin-trapping compound PBN caused a decrease in the level of oxidized protein and an increase in both GS and neutral protease activity in aged Mongolian gerbil brain. In contrast to aged gerbils, PBN treatment of young adult gerbils had no significant effect on brain oxidized protein content or GS activity. Male gerbils, young adults (3 months of age) and retired breeders (15-18 months of age), were treated with PBN for 14 days with twice daily dosages of 32 mg/kg. If PBN administration was ceased after 2 weeks, the significantly decreased level of oxidized protein and increased GS and neutral protease activities in old gerbils changed in a monotonic fashion back to the levels observed in aged gerbils prior to PBN administration. We also report that old gerbils make more errors than young animals and that older gerbils treated with PBN made fewer errors in a radial arm maze test for temporal and spatial memory than the untreated aged controls. These data can be interpreted to indicate that oxidation of cellular proteins may be a critical determinant of brain function. Moreover, it also implies that there is an age-related increase in vulnerability of tissue to oxidation that can be modified by free radical trapping compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Solubilized noncovalent complexes of [Arg8]-vasopressin (AVP) with receptor proteins from rat liver membranes were isolated by selective binding to silica-immobilized antisense (AS) peptide. The affinity chromatographic support was prepared with a chemically synthesized AS peptide whose sequence is encoded by the AS DNA corresponding to the 20 amino-terminal residues of the AVP bovine neurophysin II biosynthetic precursor [pro-AVP/BNPII-(20-1)], a region that includes the AVP sequence at residues 1-9. The AVP-related AS peptide previously was shown to bind selectively to AVP. The AS peptide-AVP interaction mechanism hypothesized, contact by hydropathic complementarily at multiple sites along the peptide chains, led to the prediction that AVP bound to its receptor would still have enough free surface to interact with immobilized AS peptide. To test this prediction of a three-way interaction, [3H]AVP-receptor was obtained as a solubilized, partially purified fraction from rat liver membrane. When this fraction was eluted through AS pro-AVP/BNPII-(20-1) silica, a complex containing [3H]AVP was bound and separated from the major, unretarded membrane protein fraction as well as from free AVP. Chemical crosslinking of [3H]AVP complex, SDS/PAGE of the products, and analysis of gel slices by scintillation counting led to detection of two major radiolabeled bands of 31 and 38 kDa. Covalent labeling was blocked when unlabeled AVP was added as a competitor before crosslinking. A third radiolabeled protein band of 15 kDa was found when the receptor complex was solubilized from rat liver membranes in the absence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Covalently crosslinked [3H]AVP complex also was bound to the AS peptide column; binding was blocked by competition with unlabeled AVP in the elution buffer. Since the AVP-linked 31- and 38-kDa proteins have the same apparent molecular mass on SDS/PAGE as found previously by photo-affinity labeling, we conclude that the AS peptide column has affinity-captured AVP-receptor complexes. The 15-kDa protein appears to be an active AVP-receptor fragment of one or both of the larger proteins. It is generally concluded that immobilized AS peptides may be useful to isolate peptide and protein-receptor complexes in other systems as well.\r"

Indeed, accumulation of alpha B-crystallin was detected immunologically in NIH 3T3 cells after incubation at elevated temperatures and after addition of Cd2+ or sodium arsenite to these cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed identity between alpha B-crystallin from eye lenses and from heat-treated fibroblasts. The promoter of the alpha B-crystallin gene was fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and was shown to confer heat inducibility on this reporter gene in transient transfection assays. A perfect heat shock element within the promoter region is likely to mediate this response. Small HSPs and alpha B-crystallin were shown to share the following two physical properties: (i) they form supramolecular structures with sedimentation values around 17 S and (ii) they are associated with the nucleus at high temperatures and are localized in the cytoplasm under normal conditions. We conclude that alpha B-crystallin has to be considered a member of the class of small HSPs.\r"

To test this hypothesis, bones from rats that were fed either +D or -D diets and kept in the dark for 8 wk were extracted and assayed for insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), the three most abundant growth factors in rat bone, and osteocalcin. Serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] were determined at sacrifice. In -D rats, there were significant reductions in serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 and skeletal TGF-beta but no differences in extractable skeletal protein, IGF-I, IGF-II, or osteocalcin compared with +D rats. To determine whether 1,25(OH)2D3 increased TGF-beta production by bone cells, we treated mouse calvaria for 6 days and mouse osteoblasts for 2 days with 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3. Production of TGF-beta was increased almost 100% by 1,25(OH)2D3. We conclude that vitamin D deficiency reduces deposition of TGF-beta in rat bone and that diminished skeletal TGF-beta could contribute to the previously observed decrease in osteoinduction in implants from -D rat bone. The findings support the possibility that vitamin D and bone-derived TGF-beta are required for normal repair of the skeleton.\r"

  ".W": "Conformations of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor were calculated by assuming that the final structure as well as properly chosen overlapping segments thereof are simultaneously in low-energy (not necessarily the lowest-energy) conformational states. Therefore, the whole chain can be built up from building blocks whose conformations are determined primarily by short-range interactions. Our earlier buildup procedure was modified by taking account of a statistical analysis of known amino acid sequences that indicates that there is nonrandom pairing of amino acid residues in short segments along the chain, and by carrying out energy minimization on only these segments and on the whole chain [without minimizing the energies of intermediate-size segments (20-30 residues long)]. Results of this statistical analysis were used to determine the variable sizes of the overlapping oligopeptide building blocks used in the calculations; these varied from tripeptides to octapeptides, depending on the amino acid sequence. Successive stages of approximations were used to combine the low-energy conformations of these building blocks in order to keep the number of variables in the computations to a manageable size. The calculations led to a limited number of conformations of the protein (only two different groups, with very similar structure within each group), most residues of which were in the same conformational state as in the native structure.\r"

Here we specifically test this notion by examining the effect of RA on neurite outgrowth from explanted segments of the axolotl spinal cord. We show that there is a threshold concentration in the region of 0.1-1 nM above which neurite outgrowth is stimulated 4-5 fold. Retinol, by contrast, only stimulated the migration of glial cells from the explants. Using HPLC we demonstrate that RA and retinol are present endogenously in the axolotl spinal cord. In addition, we have identified by immunocytochemistry with antipeptide antibodies the cells of the spinal cord that contain the binding proteins for RA (cellular RA-binding protein; CRABP) and retinol (cellular retinol-binding protein; CRBP). CRABP is found in the axons and CRBP is found in the ependyma and glial cells. These results provide strong evidence for a role for RA in the developing nervous system, and we propose a specific hypothesis involving CRBP, CRABP, retinol, and RA in the control of axon outgrowth in the spinal cord.\r"

High levels of two ChAT transcripts of 3.5 and 1.3 kilobases were detected by Northern blot analysis of adult rat testis RNA. A single ChAT mRNA species of 3.2 kilobases was detected in human testis. Cells responsible for the synthesis of ChAT mRNA in rat testis were localized by in situ hybridization in the middle part of the seminiferous epithelium, where the labeling was mostly found over spermatocytes and spermatids. Studies on the ontogeny of ChAT mRNA expression showed low levels in prepubertal rats with increasing levels as sexual maturation is reached. A peak of expression was seen at postnatal day 32, correlating with the onset of postmeiotic spermatogenesis. Results from surgical and pharmacological treatments suggest that androgens, as well as pituitary factors, could influence the relative levels of the two ChAT mRNAs detected in rat testis. Evidence for translation of the mRNA detected in the testis was obtained from the demonstration of ChAT-like immunoreactivity in ejaculated human spermatozoa. The staining was restricted to the postacrosomal region of the head, where the membrane of the sperm first fuses with that of the egg during fertilization, and to the annulus, a ring of dense material in the caudal end of the midpiece. Combined, these findings support the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter ACh is involved in reproductive function.\r"

We have identified another version of this IL-1ra, which is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells. This IL-1ra lacks a leader sequence and, thus, is probably intracellular. Both proteins are derived from the same gene through use of an alternative transcriptional start site and internal splice-acceptor site. Expression of intracellular IL-1ra cDNA in COS cells demonstrated that the intracellular product specifically inhibited exogenous interleukin 1-dependent responses. Keratinocytes were shown to contain significant amounts of nonsecreted IL-1ra protein. Constitutive expression of the intracellular IL-1ra may be an intracellular defensive mechanism in exposed epithelial cells and/or may serve to regulate autocrine interleukin 1-mediated pathways of differentiation.\r"

The polymorphisms in the beta-pleated sheet have been conserved between species and appear to reflect the ancestral relationships among haplotypes, whereas polymorphic segments encoding the alpha-helical domain appear to have been inserted by interallelic sequence exchange into the framework of different ancestral DRB1 sequences. Allelic polymorphism at the DRB1 locus may thus have been generated in part by combining different variants of the two structural domains.\r"

Recent reports showed, using in situ hybridization, that the enkephalin-encoding gene, proenkephalin A (pEnkA), is expressed in nondifferentiated cells of diverse mesodermal lineages. The transient expression of pEnkA in these tissues during organogenesis suggests that this gene is involved in processes such as differentiation and/or cell proliferation. In situ hybridization revealed that bone and cartilage are among the tissues that express pEnkA most actively during organogenesis. Here we show that pEnkA mRNA is abundant in normal calvaria-derived cells and in osteosarcoma-derived cell lines ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 25/1. In addition, pEnkA-derived peptides are synthesized and secreted by these cells, as revealed by specific RIA. pEnkA expression in ROS cells is decreased by osteogenin, an osteoinductive factor, and by the calcium-regulating hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas the osteoblastic phenotype marker, alkaline phosphatase, is increased by these factors. These results together with the inhibitory effects of pEnkA-derived peptides on alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells suggest that pEnkA is involved in bone development and provide a model system for further analysis of pEnkA expression during this process.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium influx in response to extracellular signals can modulate gene transcription. A constitutive, calcium/calmodulin-independent mutant of type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was capable of increasing the transcription rate of specific genes independently of protein kinase C activation. This increase was mediated by transferable cis-active elements capable of binding the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer binding protein. Therefore, the activation of type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in response to stimuli that increase intracellular calcium is proposed to represent a distinct second messenger pathway in calcium-mediated regulation of gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "We show that the product of the protooncogene c-rel is a constituent of an NF-kappa B-like complex that binds to the kappa B site originally identified in the enhancer of immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene. c-rel protein synthesized in bacteria binds to the kappa B site in a sequence-specific manner. The rel-kappa B complex can be disrupted by incubation with anti-rel antibodies. The rel protein can form oligomers. The c-rel protein can activate transcription from promoters containing kappa B sites; v-rel, on the other hand, suppresses the transcription of genes linked to kappa B sites. Thus, v-rel may interfere with the normal transcriptional machinery of the cell by acting as a dominant negative mutant.\r"

  ".W": "Oligonucleotide fragments derived from the 3' CCA terminus of acylated tRNA, such as CACCA-(AcPhe), UACCA-(AcLeu), and CAACCA-(fMet), bind specifically to ribosomes in the presence of sparsomycin and methanol [Monro, R. E., Celma, M. L. & Vazquez, D. (1969) Nature (London) 222, 356-358]. All three oligonucleotides protect a characteristic set of bases in 23S rRNA from chemical probes: G2252, G2253, A2439, A2451, U2506, and U2585. A2602 shows enhanced reactivity. These account for most of the same bases that are protected when peptidyl-tRNA analogues such as AcPhe-tRNA are bound to the ribosomal P site, and correspond precisely to those bases whose protection is abolished by removal of the 3'-CA end of tRNA. We conclude that most of the observed interactions between tRNA and 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal P site involve the conserved CCA terminus of tRNA. Sparsomycin may inhibit protein synthesis by stabilizing interaction between the peptidyl-CCA and the 23S P site, preventing formation of the intermediate A/P hybrid state.\r"
