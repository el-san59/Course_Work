  ".W": "Coloanal anastomosis after resection of the rectum is the ultimate procedure to preserve the patient's sphincter and avoid a permanent colostomy. Carcinoma of the midrectum, and sometimes of the lower third of the rectum, may not require excision of the pelvic floor and anus for cure. A colonal anastomosis was achieved in 38 patients in whom the indications for surgery were carcinoma in 29, recurrent or extensive adenomas in four, radiation proctitis in two, rectal fistula following radical cystectomy in one, secondary low Hartmann reconstruction after a failed attempt in one, and stenosis of a very low colorectal anastomosis in one. Twenty-six patients were men and 12 women, with a mean age of 62. Dukes' staging for carcinoma were A: 9, B: 7, C: 11, and two had a palliative resection. The mean distance from the anus was 6.0 cm. All had a temporary defunctioning colostomy. There were no postoperative deaths and 17 (45 percent) had postoperative complications, major in 7 (18 percent), minor in 10 (26 percent). Mean follow-up is now 40 months (range, 12 to 64 months). Among patients who underwent curative resection, three have had pelvic recurrences. Two of these patients died of widespread distant disease and one underwent abdominoperineal resection and is now free of disease. All others are alive with no evidence of disease. The colostomy was closed in all but six (16 percent). Two (palliative) died within the colostomy and the other four are awaiting closure. Anastomotic stricture was the most common long-term problem, occurring in 16 and requiring more than one dilatation in eight. Six months after closing the colostomy, the mean daily number of bowel movements is 3.8. Twenty-six (87 percent) are continent to solid stools, two are incontinent to solid stools, and 16 have to wear a pad to prevent soiling. All but one prefer their present status to having their colostomy. In selected cases of rectal carcinoma with little or no extramural spread, the authors estimate that resection and colonal anastomosis is a good alternative with acceptable function and a low rate of recurrent disease, which is comparable to complete rectal excision but avoids a permanent colostomy. However, it should not be a substitute for standard abdominoperineal resection for extensive lower rectal carcinoma or for a colorectal anastomosis when the latter is technically feasible.\r"

There were 17 men and 10 women (mean age, 68.5 years). Twenty patients were admitted for obstructing carcinoma of the left colon; 11 underwent immediate surgery, while the remaining 9 underwent delayed surgery after 12 hours of intravenous fluids and nasogastric suction. Of the remaining seven patients, five had perforated sigmoid diverticula and diffuse peritonitis and two had obstructing diverticular disease of the left colon with remarkable bowel distention. One hospital mortality occurred secondary to a ruptured aortic aneurysm. The radiologic anastomotic leakage rate was 14.8 percent. Clinical anastomotic dehiscence was not observed.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this prospective study is to investigate whether anal manometry is useful in orienting the surgical policy and improving the clinical and functional results following surgery for fistula-in-ano. Anal manometry was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 96 patients. The results of surgery, in terms of both fecal soiling and recurrence rate, were analyzed and compared with those of another group of 36 subjects. Some operative maneuvers, such as internal sphincterotomy, laying open of the fistula with division of striated muscle, or use of a seton, were carried out according to the preoperative sphincter pattern as shown by anal manometry in the first group. A standard procedure was followed in the control group. The recurrence rate was 3 percent in the anal manometry group and 13 percent in the control group (P less than 0.01); postoperative soiling occurred in 14 percent of patients in the anal manometry group compared with 31 percent of patients in the control group (P less than 0.001). The functional results in transsphincteric and suprasphincteric fistulas, which are usually considered at higher risk for postoperative incontinence, were better in the anal manometry group, due to greater use of the seton. No increase in recurrence rate was observed in these complex fistulas after anal manometry. Internal sphincterotomy led to a disordered continence, mainly when associated with division of striated muscle; a significant decrease in resting tone from 56 +/- 22 to 47 +/- 50 and voluntary contraction from 114 +/- 30 to 85 +/- 28 mm Hg (mean +/- S) was found after surgery in patients with soiling. In conclusion, the routine use of anal manometry may be recommended in the management of patients with fistula-in-ano as it improves the clinical and functional outcome of surgery.\r"

The individual additional prognostic factors are partly of significance in some pTNM defined stages and substages, but not in others. In order to obtain the most detailed knowledge of prognostic factors after radical resection for cure, multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma must be performed not only in separate colonic and rectal groups, but also separately for each of the individual pTNM defined stages and substages.\r"

Intestinal absorption was impaired for lactose in 18 percent, for D-xylose in 27 percent, and for 75SeHCAT in 83 percent. Morphologic changes in ileal-pouch specimens consisted of a marked flattening of the villi and augmentation in crypt number and length. The number of Paneth's cells was increased compared with normal ileum. Parameters, indicating neorectal function such as stool frequency, pouch volume, and intestinal transit, improved in time during the postoperative course. Because of impaired small-bowel function, which is not restricted to the pouch reservoir, the ileum acquires progressive colonic capacities in accordance with its morphologic transformation to a colonic type mucosa. None of our patients developed clinical malabsorption requiring regular therapeutic substitution beyond a well-balanced diet due to these morphologic and functional changes and postoperative acceptance was good or excellent in all but one case.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic usefulness of four variables and four staging systems were evaluated by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and conventional statistical tests for survival time analysis (log rank test, generalized Kruskal-Wallis test, and linear trend test), based on the data of 394 colorectal cancer patients who had been followed for more than 5 years after surgery. The four variables were the histopathologic findings of cancer penetration through the bowel wall (w), lymphnode metastasis (n), intraoperative observations of liver metastasis (H), and peritoneal dissemination (P). They were graded according to the general rules proposed by the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JRSCCR). The staging systems were Turnbull's modification of Dukes' classification, UICC's TNM system, the Japanese classification proposed by JRSCCR, and the authors' modification of the latter. AIC calculated changing the cutoff points of survival time, as well as by reclassifying predictor variables into two categories by different levels. The results of the standard tests differed from those of AIC in the evaluation of the four variables. The former statistics showed that the intraoperative observations were of more prognostic importance than the histopathologic findings, whereas AIC revealed that the histopathologic variables have more prognostic information except for prediction of early outcome. Further analysis of the w-factor showed that survival is more drastically changed by serosal involvement or extensive extramuscular invasion than by penetration of the muscularis propria. Analysis of the n-factor indicated that a major change in survival time occurs twice, i.e., when lymphnode metastasis occurs and when it extends beyond the paracolic level. Compared with single variables, the staging system using multiple factors gives more information on both early and long-term outcomes. The authors conclude that AIC analysis provides prognostic information that cannot be obtained with conventional tests.\r"

Within 15 min, TSH induced, at 10 pM and higher concentrations, a decrease in morphological index together with a rise in cAMP levels in a TSH dose-dependent manner. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and RO 20-1724, the latter two being phosphodiesterase inhibitors, mimicked these TSH effects, indicating that the rise in cAMP levels is responsible for the TSH effect. Extracellular ATP and its derivatives, known as purinergic receptor agonists, decreased cAMP levels and caused a complete reversal of the TSH morphological effect. Prior exposure of the cells to islet-activating protein (pertussis toxin), the depletion of extracellular Ca2+, or the addition of low doses of protein kinase-C inhibitors completely abolished the inhibitory action of ATP on the TSH effect, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates protein kinase-C, mimicked the ATP action to some extent. Thus, although the TSH-induced change in cell morphology seems to be dependent on cAMP levels, the inhibition of TSH action by ATP seems to be mediated by at least two signal transduction pathways involving islet-activating protein substrate G-proteins: one inhibiting adenylate cyclase and the other involving Ca2+ and protein kinase-C.\r"

The theca folliculi in avian species produces T and E and is anatomically comprised of the theca interna and the theca externa. It is not known, however, whether both T and E are produced by the same cell type. In the present study, preovulatory follicles of adult female turkeys were separated into their anatomical subdivisions, the granulosa, theca interna, and theca externa, and the relative steroidogenic contribution by each layer was investigated. Granulosa cells from the largest (F1) and fifth largest (F5) preovulatory follicles produced increasing levels of P in response to ovine LH (oLH; 0-10 micrograms/ml); however, T and E were not detectable. Theca interna and theca externa cells from F5 follicles were cultured alone or in combination. Theca interna cells produced P and T, but not E. Theca externa cells produced P, T, and E. E production was greatly enhanced by coincubation of cells from the two theca layers. oLH, (0-100 ng/ml) stimulated theca interna P and T production and E production by the coincubation of theca interna and theca externa cells. When theca interna and theca externa cells from the F1 and F5 follicles were tested, theca externa cells from F5, but not F1, converted androstenedione and T, but not P into E, indicating a loss of aromatase activity in the theca externa with follicular maturation. Neither F1 nor F5 theca interna cells converted P, A, or T into estradiol, providing additional evidence that aromatase activity is limited exclusively to the theca externa. Addition of oLH (0-100 ng/ml) did not increase conversion of T into E by the F5 theca externa cells, suggesting that production of E by the theca externa is substrate driven and not influenced by direct LH action. Avian ovarian steroidogenesis is described using a three-cell model, with the principle sources of P, T, and E being the granulosa, theca interna, and theca externa cells, respectively.\r"

In serum-deprived osteoblast-enriched (ob) cultures from fetal rat bone, recombinant human PDGF (composed of a B chain homodimer) at 0.1-3 nM enhanced the rate of DNA synthesis by 2- to 8-fold within 24 h of treatment, and 0.3-3 nM PDGF increased cell number by 1.3- to 1.6-fold. Unlike results with rat kidney fibroblast cultures, the mitogenic effect of PDGF in ob cultures was not synergistic with that of insulin-like growth factor I. PDGF at 0.3-10 nM also enhanced the rates of collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis in ob cultures by 1.5- to 4.0-fold, and these increases were blocked when DNA synthesis was prevented. The stimulatory effects of PDGF did not appear specific to ob cultures from fetal rat bone, since similar increases were found in bone cell cultures containing fibroblasts and osteoblast precursors. PDGF binding at 4 C to ob cultures indicated a single class of receptors with a Kd of 0.16 nM and approximately 60,000 sites/cell. Polyacrylamide gel of 125I-PDGF bound and cross-linked to ob cultures revealed a single radioactive band at approximately 180,000-190,000 mol wt. The present studies, therefore, indicate that PDGF can directly increase replication and matrix protein synthesis by both differentiated and undifferentiated bone cells, and that bone- or platelet-derived PDGF may have an important anabolic role in bone remodeling or fracture repair.\r"

  ".W": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and reductase mRNA level were determined in adrenals from hamsters treated with ACTH, with or without cycloheximide or aminoglutethimide. Both reductase activity and reductase mRNA level were similarly enhanced by ACTH administration compared to levels in NaCl-treated animals. The administration of cycloheximide with ACTH resulted in a 73% decrease in reductase activity compared to control values, but did not prevent the enhancing effect of ACTH on the reductase mRNA level. Furthermore, the administration of cycloheximide alone diminished HMG-CoA reductase activity, but enhanced by 1.1- to 1.6-fold the reductase mRNA level. Coadministration of aminoglutethimide with ACTH also resulted in a decrease (65%) in reductase activity compared to that in NaCl-treated animals. However, coadministration of aminoglutethimide, in contrast to cycloheximide, with ACTH not only prevented the reductase mRNA level increase produced by ACTH, but also resulted in a 30% decrease in the reductase mRNA level compared to that in controls injected with 0.15 M NaCl. In addition, aminoglutethimide alone resulted in 50% and 54% decreases in reductase mRNA level and reductase activity, respectively. Thus, we have shown that both cycloheximide and aminoglutethimide can prevent the enhancing effect of ACTH on HMG-CoA reductase activity, but their modes of action differ. It is likely that the aminoglutethimide inhibition could be the result of a diminution of specific reductase gene transcription, whereas cycloheximide would result in inhibition of the synthesis of specific proteins, including HMG-CoA reductase. In this respect, since the adrenal free cholesterol content was increased in groups treated with ACTH-aminoglutethimide, we postulate that free cholesterol could be one of the important components involved in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription. As for the ACTH-cycloheximide-treated groups, the adrenal free cholesterol content was also increased, but the effect of ACTH on the reductase mRNA level was not prevented, presumably because this drug blocked the synthesis of a putative sterol regulatory protein that is required to repress HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription.\r"

The mechanism whereby glucocorticoids exert this effect is unclear, and circulating somatomedin levels have been reported to be low, normal, or high in this situation. Since recent studies have emphasized the importance of autocrine or paracrine insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), we have examined the effects of dexamethasone (DXM) on IGF-I gene expression in the hypophysectomized (hypox) and pituitary intact rat. An increase in IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance of approximately 5-, 3-, 2-, and 1.5-fold in the liver, proximal tibia, lung, and kidney, respectively, was seen in hypox rats killed 6 h after injection of human GH (100 micrograms/100 g body wt). As little as 1 micrograms/100 g body wt of DXM administered 3 h before GH injection significantly reduced GH induction of IGF-I mRNA in the liver and the proximal tibia (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.005, respectively). Higher doses of DXM were required to reduce IGF-I mRNA abundance in the kidney and lung. Of the tissues examined the order of sensitivity to DXM was liver greater than tibia greater than kidney greater than lung. In contrast to the effects of DXM on tissue IGF-I mRNA abundance, an approximately 10-fold higher dose of DXM was required to inhibit the GH-induced rise in serum IGF-I concentration. The effect of DXM on steady state IGF-I mRNA abundance in pituitary-intact rats which were killed 9 h after DXM was also examined. The reduction in IGF-I mRNA abundance required higher doses of DXM (6-360 micrograms/100 g body wt) and was less marked in pituitary-intact rats than in GH-treated hypox rats. In the pituitary-intact rats the order of sensitivity to DXM was tibia greater than liver greater than lung greater than kidney. In acute studies serum IGF-I levels were not decreased by any dose of DXM; rather a significant increase in serum IGF-I was apparent in pituitary intact rats, treated with the lowest and highest doses of DXM. When DXM was administered daily for 6 days to pituitary intact rats, body wt gain and hepatic and tibial IGF-I mRNA abundance were significantly reduced. No significant changes were seen in serum IGF-I concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These peptides correspond to sequences from amino acids 201-215, 231-245, and 247-261. We have used these peptides to develop polyclonal antibodies to the DNA-binding domain of ER. Six positive antisera were obtained against these peptides, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Three of these antisera recognized the functional form of ER, as determined by sucrose density gradient analysis. The antisera that recognized the native form of ER were then tested for their ability to cross-react with other steroid receptors and with ER from other species. No cross-reaction with the native progesterone, glucocorticoid, or androgen receptors was observed. The antisera cross-reacted with cytosolic ER from calf and rat uterine tissues as well as human breast cancer tissue. The antisera recognized ER in its monomeric (4S), dimeric (5S), and multimeric (8S) forms. These antisera were site specific, since the free peptides displaced ER binding to the antibodies. The antibodies also recognized the unoccupied ER, as demonstrated by sucrose density gradients and postlabeling analysis. Thus, we have obtained three site-specific antibodies that recognize the DNA-binding region of the ER. These antibodies should prove useful as structural probes for the analysis of receptor-DNA interactions and elucidation of the functional domains of ER.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously proposed that the effects of heat shock on thyroid hormone-responsive rat pituitary tumor (GC) cells may be a model relevant to the in vivo effects of nonthyroidal disease on thyroid hormone action. To determine the effects of heat shock on thyroid hormone responses, GC cells (normally cultured at 37 C) were studied after incubation at 41 C. After 18 h at 41 C there was enhanced synthesis of proteins (mol wt, 70,000 and 90,000) considered to be universal markers of the cellular response to heat shock. Incubation at 41 C also resulted in a significant decrease in GC cell viability and (after 24 h) arrest of GC cell growth. However, the induction of GH synthesis by T3 was significantly enhanced in GC cells stressed by incubation at 41 C. The addition of 5 nM T3 to thyroid hormone-depeleted GC cells resulted in a significantly greater (P less than 0.001) accumulation of GH (2642 +/- 280 ng/18 h) during 41 C incubation than during 37 C incubation (1223 +/- 175 ng/18 h). The enhanced T3-induced production of GH was coincident with a proportional increase (P less than 0.05) in cellular GH mRNA determined by dot hybridization analysis. Thus, the stress of 41 C incubation elicits a heat shock response in GC cells characterized by decreased viability and growth arrest, but enhanced accumulation of GH mRNA in response to T3. Our recent report on the identical effects due to the stress of implantation of the Walker 256 carcinoma on T3-induced rat pituitary GH mRNA in vivo suggests that heat shock of cultured GC cells is a valid in vitro model of nonthyroidal disease.\r"

A rabbit immunized with a peptide derived from the hinge region of the receptor produced an antiserum which showed 50% displacement with 20 pg peptide at a final serum dilution of 1:35,000. When the antiserum was immunopurified and applied to sections of intact rat and human kidney it stained cells lining segments corresponding to distal tubule, connecting piece, and initial cortical collecting duct, consistent with the known sites of mineralocorticoid action. In both human (formaldehyde-fixed) and rat (Bouin's solution) there was ample evidence for both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The thymus, in which previously we have found [3H]aldosterone binding to be below detection limits, showed little or no staining. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the polyclonal antibody recognized an epitope of the expected molecular size. The availability of antibodies to the mineralocorticoid receptor should, thus, facilitate investigation of the steroid specificity-conferring mechanism which allows mineralocorticoids, but not glucocorticoids, access to the nonselective receptor in the kidney.\r"

Synthetic polypeptides comprising the amino-terminus of human PTH-related protein (PTH-rp) were examined for effects in intact fetal rat calvariae, and in osteoblast-enriched (ob) cultures isolated from fetal rat parietal bone. In cultured calvariae, 0.5-5 nM PTH-rp stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 25-70% after 24 h of treatment and decreased relative [3H]proline incorporation into collagen by 50%; the inhibitory effect on collagen production was not altered by hydroxyurea, which decreased DNA synthesis by 85%. PTH-rp also increased [3H]hydroxyproline levels by 100% in culture medium from bones prelabeled with [3H]proline, indicating accelerated matrix turnover. In contrast to results in intact calvariae, PTH-rp had little effect on basal DNA and collagen synthesis in serum-deprived ob cultures. However, when ob cultures were treated with transforming growth factor type beta at concentrations similar to those found in calvarial culture medium, 0.02-2 nM PTH-rp enhanced DNA synthesis and decreased collagen production. Furthermore, equimolar PTH-rp and PTH concentrations similarly displaced 125I-PTH-rp binding and enhanced cAMP synthesis in ob cultures. These studies suggest that PTH-rp regulates osteoblastic cell activity primarily through PTH-related pathways and may act in part by modulating the effects of locally produced transforming growth factor-beta in bone.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNCs) by various fragments of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) was examined in mouse marrow cultures. Osteoclast-like MNCs were defined as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-positive MNCs with calcitonin receptors. In all experimental protocols examined, PTHrP-(1-34) induced TRACP-positive MNCs at almost the same rate as PTH-(1-34). PTHrP-(1-29) was less potent than PTHrP-(1-34). PTHrP-(1-25) and PTHrP-(1-14) had no effect. PTHrP-(1-34) was more potent than PTH-(1-34) in increasing the accumulation of cAMP, but the former appeared to lose its activity more rapidly than the latter. Isobutylmethylxanthine increased the effect of PTHrP-(1-34) and PTH-(1-34) in inducing TRACP-positive MNCs. Furthermore, the calcium ionophore A23187 significantly increased the formation of TRACP-positive MNCs. The effect of PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-34) in inducing TRACP-positive MNCs was potentiated by adding A23187 but suppressed by adding verapamil simultaneously. The inhibition by verapamil was overcome by adding A23187. [Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(3-34)amide inhibited the effect of not only PTH-(1-34) but also PTHrP-(1-34) in inducing both the accumulation of cAMP and the TRACP-positive MNC formation. These results show that PTHrP is a potent stimulator of osteoclast-like MNC formation to almost the same extent as PTH. It increases the number of osteoclast-like MNCs by a mechanism involving cAMP and calcium ions, and is most likely mediated through the same receptor. The controversial results of the bone-resorbing activity of PTH and PTHrP reported so far may be explained by the differences in the relative potencies of the respective hormones in increasing the intracellular cAMP and calcium ions and by the shorter half-life of PTHrP in culture medium.\r"

In radioligand binding assays, L-156,373 [cyclo(L-Pro-D-Phe-N-OH-L-Ile-D-piperazyl-L-piperazyl-N-Me-D -Phe)] exhibited moderate affinity for rat uterine OT receptors (Ki, 150 nM), with some selectivity (approximately 20-fold) vs. liver AVP-V1 and kidney AVP-V2 receptors. Dehydroxylation of N-hydroxyisoleucine and oxidation of the piperazic acid residues of L-156-373 produced an interesting derivative, L-365,209. These structural modifications increased OT receptor affinity and selectivity by 20- and 2.5-5-fold, respectively. In the isolated rat uterus, L-365,209 was a potent (apparent dissociation constant, 1.7 nM) and competitive OT antagonist. L-365,209 also blocked the effects of AVP at both AVP-V1 (phosphatidylinositol turnover in rat hepatocytes) and AVP-V2 (adenylate cyclase in rat kidney medulla) receptors, but only at low micromolar concentrations. L-365,209, given iv to anesthetized rats, antagonized the action of exogenous OT on the uterus (ID50, 460 micrograms/kg) with a relatively long duration of action. L-365,209 represents a unique class of compounds that provides an entirely new approach for the design of antagonists for these neurohypophyseal hormones.\r"

These binding sites, localized in the circumference of the epididymal tubule and most concentrated within the proximal cauda, are present throughout the caput, corpus, and remaining cauda epididymis.

  ".W": "To obtain evidence of a physiological role for androgens and estrogens in the regulation of the epididymis of sexually immature rabbits, the effects of these hormones on [35S] methionine incorporation into epididymal proteins in vitro were examined. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that short term incubation with estradiol changed the patterns of radiolabeled proteins detected in tissue homogenates of epididymal segments from castrated rabbits compared to those in segments from castrated rabbits that were not exposed to exogenous estradiol. Most of the changes seen in corpus tissue affected proteins with a wide range of pI values and relatively high mol wt (greater than 40K). The effects on caput and cauda tissue proteins were seen over a wide pH and mol wt range. Castration abolished many of the regional differences in protein synthesis; these were restored by incubation with estradiol. Testosterone had little effect on the synthesis of tissue proteins, except for stimulation of the synthesis of a single protein (17K; pI 5.1) in all three segments and stimulation of a small group of proteins (less than 14K; pI 7.0-7.2) in the corpus. Estradiol had little effect on proteins secreted by epididymal segments. Testosterone, however, stimulated the synthesis of a number of unique proteins secreted by the caput and corpus and resulted in a pattern of radiolabeled proteins similar to that obtained with intact animals. Additional secretory proteins could be stimulated in caput, but not corpus, tissue minces from intact rabbits by exogenous testosterone. No androgen-specific synthesis of secretory proteins was detected in the cauda of either castrated or intact rabbits. Estradiol affected the synthesis of both secreted and tissue proteins in terms of influencing which epididymal segment was most active at incorporating [35S]methionine into radiolabeled proteins and which was least active. Testosterone had a similar influence on secreted proteins, but did not have any analogous effect on tissue proteins. These results indicate that testosterone and estradiol influence the synthesis of proteins by the immature rabbit epididymis and that both may, therefore, be important physiological regulators of epididymal development and/or function.\r"

The changes in the caput could be reversed if the samples were incubated with testosterone. The epididymis of short term castrates failed to respond to exogenous estradiol. Long term castration (4-6 weeks) resulted in changes in protein synthesis among all three epididymal segments. Short term (4-h) incubation with testosterone restored the pattern of proteins secreted by the caput and cauda to that in intact rabbits. Short term incubation with estradiol did not restore the pattern of radiolabeled secreted proteins, but it did slightly intensify a 28K protein (pI 5.2) that was present in the caput and cauda of castrated animals. No clear-cut effect of the hormones on proteins secreted by the corpus was observed. Short term incubation with testosterone or estradiol restored the patterns of tissue proteins synthesized by the caput and corpus of castrated rabbits to that in intact animals. In the cauda, estradiol also enhanced the presence of a small group of high mol wt proteins present in the control castrate sample, while testosterone inhibited these proteins. This group of proteins was absent in cauda tissue samples from intact rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to use an approach targeted specifically on endogenous relaxin to determine the influence of antepartum (days 20-22) relaxin on cervical modifications and birth in the rat. To that end, a monoclonal antibody specific for rat relaxin, designated MCA1, was used to neutralize endogenous relaxin in intact pregnant rats. MCA1 or PBS vehicle was administered iv to intact rats daily from days 20-22 of pregnancy. Cervices were removed at 1200 h on day 22. Cervices obtained from MCA1-treated rats were less extensible than cervices obtained from PBS-treated control rats. Furthermore, wet weight, dry weight, water content, and uronate content were lower in cervices obtained from MCA1-treated rats than in cervices from PBS-treated controls. Birth and maternal behavior of MCA1-treated and PBS-treated control rats were observed continuously from 2100 h on day 22 until day 2 postpartum (d2PP). MCA1-treated rats exhibited significantly prolonged durations of litter delivery as well as reduced incidences of live pups on d2PP compared with controls. There were lower incidences of normal maternal behavior observed at birth and on d1PP with MCA1-treated rats than with control rats. In addition, little or no milk was observed in the abdomen of most live pups of MCA1-treated rats on d2PP, whereas abundant milk was observed in the abdomen of all live pups of control rats. The mean live pup weight on d2PP was lower in the litters of MCA1-treated rats than in control litters. The present study indicates that in the rat endogenous relaxin is needed during the antepartum period for normal cervical growth and extensibility, normal litter delivery, and high postpartum pup survival. This work supports the hypothesis that the influence of endogenous relaxin on birth is attributable, at least in part, to its effects on the cervix.\r"

A low calcium is the major signal for PTH secretion, and a high calcium for calcitonin secretion. We report here that calcium has no effect on calcitonin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in vivo in the rat, but that a low calcium markedly stimulates PTH mRNA levels. Serum calcium was decreased by ip phosphorus and increased by calcium gluconate (ip or iv infusion) and demonstrated that a low serum calcium markedly increased PTH mRNA levels whereas a high serum calcium had no effect. There was no change in mRNAs for calcitonin or actin in the same thyroparathyroid extracts. After phosphorus ip serum calcium decreased from 10.4 to 8.5 mg/dl and PTH mRNA increased up to 3-fold at 1, 3, and 6 h. Gel blots showed that a low calcium increased PTH mRNA levels with no change in its size (833 base pairs). Calcitonin ip decreased both serum calcium and phosphorus with an up to 5-fold increase in PTH mRNA at 1 h, thus demonstrating that the effect of phosphorus on PTH mRNA was due to the low serum calcium and not the high serum phosphorus. When phosphorus and 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 pmol/100 g) were injected together, despite the low serum calcium, there was a decrease in PTH mRNA levels. These results show a linear relationship between calcium and PTH gene expression, but not calcitonin or actin, with a dominant role for 1,25(OH)2D3.\r"

  ".W": "Current evidence indicates that signal transduction after receptor binding of PTH involves the stimulation of adenylate cyclase as well as stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism. Recent studies, showing that PTH alters phosphate transport in opossum kidney cells at concentrations which do not increase cAMP production and that activators of protein kinase-C also alter phosphate transport, have led to the suggestion that there is a dual mechanism for the regulation of phosphate transport by PTH, namely, protein kinase-C at physiological levels of PTH and cAMP at higher levels of PTH. The present studies were designed to evaluate the relationship between cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A), a more sensitive indicator of alterations in cAMP metabolism than measurements of total cellular cAMP, and phosphate transport in opossum kidney cells, in response to bovine (b)PTH 1-34 and [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bPTH 3-34 amide. While bPTH 1-34 markedly stimulated cAMP accumulation (half-maximal stimulation between 1 and 10 nM), PTH 3-34 analog did not. Phosphate transport was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by bPTH 1-34, with half-maximal effect occurring between 0.1 and 1 nM. [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bPTH 3-34 amide also altered phosphate transport, although this peptide was 3 orders of magnitude less potent than bPTH 1-34. PK-A activity increased in response to bPTH 1-34 and correlated closely with the effects of PTH on phosphate transport. [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bPTH 3-34 amide, which did not appear to increase cAMP, also resulted in a significant increase in the activity of PK-A. Studies of inhibition of cAMP accumulation using 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine demonstrated that while this agent markedly inhibited the accumulation of cAMP in response to PTH, the effects of PTH on phosphate transport were not altered. However, in spite of the reduction in cAMP the activation of PK-A was similar to control. These data indicate that the effects of PTH peptides on phosphate transport are more closely related to changes in the activity of PK-A than to levels of total cAMP. Activation of PK-A in response to PTH is demonstrable at the lowest doses of PTH that alter phosphate transport.\r"

  ".U": "89289576\r", 
  ".W": "The thymic epithelium is responsible for the secretion of thymic peptides, which intervene in some steps of intra- and extrathymic T cell differentiation. Recent data suggest that thymic hormone secretion is modulated by the neuroendocrine network, comprising thyroid, adrenals, and gonads. However, the role of the pituitary gland in this regulation is still poorly understood. In the present paper we studied the in vivo and in vitro influences of PRL on the secretion of thymulin, one of the chemically defined thymic hormones, by thymic epithelial cells (TEC). When injected daily (20-100 micrograms/20 g) in young or old C57BL/6 mice, PRL induced a specific increase in thymulin synthesis and secretion, respectively, measured by the number of thymulin-producing cells in the thymus and the peripheral levels of the hormone. This stimulation was dose dependent and reversible after the end of treatment. Similar findings have been made in animals with pituitary dwarfism, known to have low levels of circulating thymulin. This stimulatory effect was also observed in primary cultures of human and mouse TEC when PRL (10(-7) to 10(-8) M) was applied to culture supernatants, thus suggesting that PRL could act directly on TEC. In addition, we induced in vivo experimental hypoprolactinemia, treating mice with bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits pituitary PRL secretion. Bromocriptine treatment (100-200 micrograms/20 g) yielded a significant decrease in thymulin secretion that could be reversed by coincident treatment with PRL. In the light of previous observations that bovine GH can also increase thymulin production in aged dogs, we performed a series of experiments in vitro to evaluate whether GH has a direct effect on TEC. We observed that only human GH preparations that are known to have a PRL-like effect were efficient in stimulating thymulin biosynthesis and release into the culture supernatants. The effects of PRL on TEC were not restricted to thymic hormone production. We observed that TEC proliferation, as well as the numbers of a TEC subset defined by the expression of cytokeratins 3 and 10, could also be increased by PRL treatment. All these findings show that the pituitary gland directly affects TEC in terms of cytoskeletal and secretory protein expression as well as cell cycle.\r"

Serum progesterone levels were determined, and the changes of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively) were simultaneously studied in the deciduoma. After stimulation on day 4 of pregnancy (D4), the serum progesterone level rose steadily to about 16 ng/ml on D12 and remained at plateau until D14. A sharp increase followed by a rapid fall in progesterone was observed on D15 and D16. The weight of the deciduoma-bearing horn increased more than 5 times to a maximal level on D10. Both deciduomal and myometrial weights were maintained and remained elevated on D16. Histological observation revealed that the maintenance of decidual cells was heterogenous. Cells at antimesometrial site (AMS) started to regress on D10, whereas cells at mesometrial site (MS) remained recognizable on D16. Cytosol ER was detected during the early stage (D6) of decidualization. The cytosol ER in the deciduoma continuously decreased and became undetectable on D10. Nuclear ER was not detected during the time of study. The nuclear and cytosol PR increased and reached a peak level on D8 and D10, respectively. The concentration of PR declined sharply afterward. The PR levels in deciduomal tissues at MS and AMS were separately studied. PR in AMS decreased gradually after D8 to basal level on D14. PR at MS still remained relatively constant on D12 followed by a precipitous decrease. These data show a prolongation of the deciduomal life span and the heterogeneity of deciduomal maintenance and regression in unilateral pregnant hamsters. This strongly suggests a close relationship between the loss of PR and the regression of the deciduoma.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies have demonstrated that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3)] reduces type I collagen synthesis and steady state levels of procollagen mRNA in cultured fetal rat calvaria and rat osteosarcoma cells. To determine whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates transcription of type I collagen genes, transcription rates were measured directly in nuclei isolated from ROS 17/2.8 cells using a nuclear run-off assay. Transcription was allowed to proceed in the presence of [32P]UTP for 20 min, at which time incorporation of radiolabeled UTP into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was maximal. UTP incorporation was inhibited 90% by 3 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D and 40% by 1 microgram/ml alpha-amanitin. Treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited procollagen gene transcription in a concentration and time dependent manner. Procollagen transcription was reduced by approximately 50% of the control rate by 10 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, and this inhibition was maximal after 24 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. The inhibition of procollagen transcription was specific for collagen, since total RNA synthesis and beta-actin transcription were not inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3. The magnitude of the decrease of procollagen transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was comparable to its inhibition of steady state procollagen mRNA levels, suggesting that transcription is the predominant mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates collagen gene expression in bone cells.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino acid member of the pancreatic polypeptide family, was found to be present by RIA and immunocytochemistry in the rat anterior pituitary gland. NPY prohormone messenger RNA (mRNA) was identified in the pituitary by Northern blot analysis. The possible regulation of NPY was examined by determining the effects of thyroid hormone manipulation on peptide synthesis. Three other anterior pituitary neuropeptides, neurotensin (NT), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), were studied for comparison. Hypothyroidism was found to significantly increase the pituitary content of NPY, SP, and VIP and their respective mRNAs but to decrease the quantity of NT. Immunocytochemistry revealed very weak NPY immunoreactivity in scattered cells in control rat anterior pituitaries, but in hypothyroid rats a greater number of positive cells were seen, and the staining was relatively intense. These positive cells were identified as a subset of thyrotropes. In T4-induced hyperthyroidism NPY, NT, and VIP levels were unaffected whereas SP concentrations fell considerably. TRH treatment produced a decrease in NT and had no effect on NPY, SP, or VIP. These changes were found only in the pituitary; no net change occurred in hypothalamic peptide and mRNA levels. Since the changes in pituitary peptide and mRNA levels occurred coordinately it appears that regulation by thyroid hormone status occurs, at least in part, directly at the level of gene transcription. The changes in these 4 regulatory peptides in hypothyroidism and their known powerful effects on pituitary function suggest that they may have a significant paracrine or autocrine influence in controlling the alterations in pituitary secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies show that limited nutrition in the ovariectomized lamb results in an impairment of LH and FSH secretion, a phenomenon that is rapidly reversible by increasing the level of nutrition and independent of ovarian steroid feedback. The present study characterizes the biosynthesis of pituitary hormones in the nutritionally growth-limited female lamb by measuring steady state mRNA concentrations. These changes were examined relatively to pituitary and serum hormone concentrations to establish the relationship(s) of synthesis and secretion in response to nutritional manipulation. Ad libitum feeding of nutritionally growth-restricted ovariectomized lambs for 14 days resulted in an increase in the frequency of episodic LH release, thereby increasing mean serum LH concentrations (P less than 0.001). Similarly, mean circulating concentrations of FSH were increased (P less than 0.001). By contrast, serum GH concentrations were lowered significantly as a result of ad libitum feeding (P less than 0.05). Serum PRL concentrations remained unchanged. Although pituitary LH and PRL concentrations were also unchanged in response to increased nutrition feeding, FSH and GH concentrations increased (P less than 0.05). Short-term ad libitum feeding of the chronically food-restricted lamb resulted in significant changes in mRNA concentrations for all hormones except PRL. The concentrations of gonadotropin subunit mRNAs (i.e. alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta) were all significantly higher in response to increased nutrition (P less than 0.001). GH mRNA was also affected; however, feeding decreased concentrations (P less than 0.001). The results demonstrate that an increase in the level of nutrition in the restricted diet lamb produces profound changes in the synthesis, storage, and secretion of LH, FSH, and GH. These changes appear to be coordinated, although the response differs depending upon the hormone.\r"

  ".U": "89289586\r", 
  ".W": "Gender differences in hypothalamic somatostatin (SS) secretion may account in part for the sexually dimorphic patterns of GH secretion in rats. Since males have lower baseline serum GH levels than females, and SS inhibits GH secretion, we hypothesized that the SS neurons in the periventricular nucleus (PeN) of the male rat would have greater biosynthetic activity than those of the female. We tested this hypothesis by measuring SS mRNA in cells in the PeN of intact male and proestrous female rats. Using in situ hybridization and a computerized image analysis system, we measured SS mRNA content in individual cells in the PeN and compared signal levels (autoradiographic grains per cell) between male and proestrous female animals. The signal level of SS mRNA in cells of the PeN was significantly greater in males than in proestrous females (males, 210 +/- 7 grains/cell; females, 158 +/- 5 grains/cell; P less than 0.0005), whereas no difference was observed in SS cells of the frontal cortex (males, 100 +/- 0.8 grains/cell; females, 99 +/- 5.9 grains/cell). This difference in SS mRNA levels is likely to be the result of different hormonal environments exerting an influence on neurons of the hypothalamus. To test the hypothesis that testosterone stimulates SS gene expression in neurons of the PeN, adult male rats were castrated and immediately implanted with either empty (sham; n = 3) or testosterone-containing (n = 3) Silastic implants of a size that would deliver physiological levels of testosterone (3.6 +/- 1.5 ng/ml). We observed that castrated animals had significantly lower levels of SS mRNA signal in neurons of the PeN compared with intact animals (intact, 195 +/- 3 grains/cell; castrated, 159 +/- 6 grains/cell; P less than 0.003) and that physiological levels of testosterone prevent this reduction in SS mRNA levels (castrated testosterone-replaced, 182 +/- 4 grains/cell; castrated, 159 +/- 6 grains/cell; P less than 0.003). Furthermore, testosterone-treated castrates had SS mRNA signal levels indistinguishable from those of intact controls (intact, 195 +/- 3 grains/cell; castrated testosterone-replaced, 182 +/- 4 grains/cell). There was no significant difference in SS mRNA levels in neurons of the frontal cortex (intact, 98 +/- 2 grains/cell; castrated, 98 +/- 3 grains/cell; castrated testosterone-replaced, 102 +/- 2 grains/cell).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89289588\r", 
  ".W": "The developing female sheep, which attains puberty after 25 weeks of age, was used as an experimental model to investigate the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the control of pulsatile LH secretion during sexual maturation. Treatment of ovary-intact prepubertal sheep at 12 weeks of age with the opiate antagonist naloxone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in LH secretion. Subsequent studies used ovariectomized (OVX) lambs implanted with capsules containing 17 beta-estradiol to provide a constant, ovarian steroid feedback signal throughout development. Naloxone treatment (hourly iv injections of 1 mg/kg BW for 4 h) produced an increase in the frequency of episodic LH secretion at all prepubertal ages, when lambs were highly sensitive to the estradiol negative feedback. However, increases in LH pulse frequency were also induced by naloxone treatment at a postpubertal age in estradiol-treated OVX sheep, indicating that opioid inhibition is still present at a time when sensitivity to the feedback effects of ovarian steroids is markedly reduced and endogenous LH secretion is increased. These observations in ovary-intact and estradiol-treated OVX lambs suggest that opioid mechanisms inhibit pulsatile tonic LH secretion during both the prepubertal and postpubertal periods. Endogenous opioid inhibition of LH secretion is not dependent on the presence of ovarian steroids, as evidenced by the response to naloxone 3 weeks after removal of an estradiol implant from OVX lambs, when LH pulse frequency was already high. Naloxone treatment increased LH pulse frequency further, at both a prepubertal age (18 weeks) and a postpubertal age (38 weeks). Naloxone also increased LH pulse frequency in OVX lambs in which LH secretion was inhibited chronically by progesterone rather than by estradiol. The response to naloxone was similar in postpubertal P-treated OVX lambs and age-matched prepubertal P-treated OVX controls in which puberty had been delayed by means of an inhibitory seasonal photoperiod. In addition, after removal of steroid implants to allow LH secretion to increase, the degree of inhibition of LH secretion by the opiate agonist morphine was similar between age-matched postpubertal sheep and those with photoperiodically delayed puberty. We conclude that endogenous opioid mechanisms are an important inhibitory mechanism controlling pulsatile LH secretion in the developing sheep. However, changes in opioid inhibition are unlikely to underlie the decrease in sensitivity to steroid negative feedback and increase in pulsatile LH secretion that occur at puberty.\r"

Fetal plasma PRL was measured every 2 h for 24 h, 7 days after the mother had received a sc Silastic implant containing approximately 1 g melatonin. Control fetuses received an empty implant. Melatonin is slowly released from implants, and it is known to cross the sheep placenta. Fetal plasma melatonin increased 10-fold after the implant. Plasma PRL in fetuses treated with melatonin was a third of that of control fetuses. Fetal plasma PRL concentrations were 56.6 +/- 5.7 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) in control and 18.1 +/- 2.7 ng/ml 7 days after the melatonin implant.

  ".W": "We have previously reported progestin stimulation of growth and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the human breast cancer cell line T47D. Our further findings now show that growth stimulation by progestins occurs in a dose-responsive manner at physiological concentrations and is inhibited by the antiprogestin RU486. 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) also stimulates proliferation and LDH, and these stimulations are inhibited by tamoxifen. In addition, tamoxifen alone slightly stimulates proliferation. Surprisingly, RU486 also inhibits stimulation by E2. Thus, RU486 acts not only as an antiprogestin, but also as an antiestrogen. While combined promegestone (R5020) and E2 substantially stimulate proliferation, when RU486 is added to this combination it does not further inhibit, but leads to enhanced stimulation. However, the same addition of RU486 to combined E2 and R5020 diminishes LDH stimulation. This suggests that LDH stimulation and growth stimulation are dissociated. Finally, tamoxifen inhibits growth stimulation by combined R5020 and E2, but addition of the antiprogestin RU486 to this combination does not lead to a further inhibition of proliferation. Even so, this same combination reduces LDH levels to control values, further suggesting that stimulation of growth and LDH are dissociated. All of these findings occurred in the absence of the estrogenic pH indicator phenol red. These results emphasize the potential of LDH as an end point for studying the mechanism of female steroid hormone action. They also reveal antiestrogenic activity in RU486. Further, they shed light on the interaction among estrogens, progestins, antiestrogens, and antiprogestins in their effects on growth. Further understanding of this complex interplay may be helpful in treatment of human breast cancer.\r"

TA3S was metabolized very rapidly by IRD to 3,3'-TA2S which was only observed transiently due to its rapid deiodination predominantly in the outer ring. Kinetic studies under initial reaction rate conditions yielded apparent Michaelis-Menten (Km) values (micromolar) of 1.8 for TA3, 0.8 for 3,3'-TA2, and 0.004 for TA3S, and 0.02 for 3,3'-TA2S and Vmax values (picomoles per min/mg protein) of 174 for TA3, 49 for 3,3'-TA2, 21 for TA3S, and 63 for 3,3'-TA2S. The Vmax/Km ratios for the IRD of TA3 and TA3S were 16 and 930 times higher, respectively, relative to T3. Deiodinations were sensitive to propylthiouracil inhibition, indicating the involvement of the type I iodothyronine deiodinase. Furthermore, the iodothyroacetic acid derivatives competitively inhibited the ORD of rT3 with apparent inhibition constant (Ki) values (0.45 microM for TA3, 4 nM for TA3S, and 0.04 microM for 3,3'-TA2S) in agreement with corresponding Km values. We conclude that 1) TA3 and 3,3'-TA2 are better substrates than T3 and 3,3'-T2 for the type I deiodinase of rat liver; 2) the IRD of TA3 and ORD of 3,3'-TA2 are markedly enhanced by sulfation similar to the parent iodothyronines; and 3) TA3S in the best known substrate for IRD due to its very high affinity for the type I deiodinase.\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic metabolism of 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (TA3), a naturally occurring side-chain analog of T3, was studied in vitro and in vivo. Metabolites were quantified by HPLC after Sephadex LH-20 prepurification of samples obtained after incubation of [125I]TA3 or 3,[3'-125I]diiodothyroacetic acid (3,[3'-125I]TA2) with isolated rat hepatocytes under various conditions or after iv administration of [125I]TA3 to normal or 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-treated rats. In protein-free incubations with hepatocytes, TA3 glucuronide (TA3G) and I- were normally the main TA3 products, i.e. 44% and 49%, respectively. In the presence of the type I deiodinase inhibitor PTU, the I- production from added TA3 decreased to 3%, and TA3 sulfate (TA3S) increased from 2-14%. Normally, 3,3'-TA2 was converted to I-, but in the presence of PTU 3,3'-TA2S was produced. In SO4(2-)-depleted cultures incubated with TA3 or 3,3'-TA2, production of I- was diminished, and the glucoronides of the substrates and the deiodinated products were generated. If both sulfation and deiodination were inhibited, TA3 and 3,3'-TA2 were cleared completely via glucuronidation. The metabolism of TA3 and especially 3,3'-TA2 was greatly retarded in cultures with 0.1% BSA. PTU treatment of TA3-injected rats reduced plasma I- levels 6-fold, increased plasma sulfates 2.6-fold, but did not affect plasma TA3 clearance. Biliary excretion of radioactivity until 4 h after [125I]TA3 injection amounted to 55% of the dose in controls vs. 85% in PTU-treated rats. In both groups, an unknown metabolite X was detected in serum and its sulfate conjugate XS in bile. The mean percent distribution of TA3G/TA3S/XS in bile amounted to 70:8:13 in control and 57:22:12 in PTU rats. In conclusion, TA3 is effectively metabolized in rat liver by glucuronidation and subsequent biliary excretion of TA3G, which may explain its rapid in vivo clearance relative to T3. Furthermore, a significant proportion of TA3 is deiodinated by the type I deiodinase, either directly or after prior sulfation.\r"

  ".U": "89289600\r", 
  ".W": "In an effort to define the mechanism by which thyroid hormone increases the synthesis of hepatic cholesterol, we have investigated both in hypophysectomized and methimazole-treated hypothyroid rats the time course of T3 effects on plasma cholesterol concentration, total hepatic cholesterol, the rate of biliary secretion of cholesterol, bile acids, and phospholipids, and the activity and mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol. A single dose of 200 micrograms T3 was estimated to maintain at least 90% nuclear occupancy for the ensuing 54 h of the experiment. In both preparations the relative rise in biliary secretion of cholesterol exceeded that of other biliary constituents and preceded by 12 h an increase in HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity and its mRNA. The level of total hepatic cholesterol remained constant throughout the experiment. We interpret these findings to suggest that T3-stimulated cholesterol synthesis is mediated by an antecedent T3-induced rise in biliary cholesterol secretion. We postulate that biliary cholesterol secretion is augmented by an intrahepatic shift of cholesterol and depletion of the hepatic sampling center responsible for the feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis. The level of HMG CoA reductase mRNA appeared to govern enzyme activity in both preparations, but the ratio of mRNA to hepatic enzyme activity was substantially greater in the methimazole-treated compared with the hyphophysectomized animals.\r"

  ".U": "89289604\r", 
  ".W": "Parturient paresis (milk fever) is a hypocalcemic disorder caused by the onset of lactation in the dairy cow. In most cows a complete recovery follows a single iv calcium treatment to correct the acute hypocalcemia. However, about 20% of cows treated for parturient paresis experience recurring episodes of hypocalcemia (relapses) requiring further treatment. Analysis of plasma from 8 nonrelapsing parturient paretic and 11 relapsing parturient paretic cows revealed differences in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] concentrations before and during the development of hypocalcemia. In nonrelapsing cows, plasma 1,25-(OH)2D increased to 4- to 5-fold as plasma calcium concentrations declined during the first stage of parturient paresis. In relapsing cows, decreases in plasma calcium concentrations during the first stage of parturient paresis were accompanied by just a 2- to 2.5-fold increase in plasma 1,25-(OH)2D. Plasma 1,25-(OH)2D eventually increased 4- to 5-fold in the relapsing cows, but this response was delayed 24-48 h compared with the response in the nonrelapsing cows. Plasma PTH concentration profiles were similar in relapsing and nonrelapsing cows, suggesting that renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase was temporarily refractory to stimulation by PTH in the relapsing cows. In both groups of cows recovery from parturient paresis began about 12-24 h after plasma 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations had increased 4- to 5-fold. These data imply that lack of production of 1,25-(OH)2D is an important factor in predisposing the cow to relapses of parturient paresis and is critical for recovery from the hypocalcemia associated with the onset of lactation.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGF-BPs) modify IGF activity. To investigate their role in regulating growth, the number and size of IGF-BPs in porcine serum and the role of nutritional and endocrine factors in controlling their relative abundance were determined. IGF-BPs were analyzed by ligand blotting; sera were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and probed with [125I]IGF-I or -II. The band intensities of various forms of IGF-BPs were quantified by scanning densitometry. Fetal and postnatal sera contained six IGF-BPs of 220,000, 43,000, 39,000, 34,000, 29,000, and 24,000 mol wt (Mr). The band intensity of all forms of IGF-BPs increased with advancing gestational age. Specifically, the intensities of the 43,000, 39,000, 34,000, 29,000, and 24,000 Mr IGF-BP bands were 2.8-, 2.7-, 4.3-, 4.4-, and 3.1-fold higher, respectively, in fetal plasma at 110 than at 45 days gestation. In fetal plasma the 34,000 and 29,000 Mr forms predominated, whereas postnatally, the 43,000 and 39,000 Mr IGF-BPs predominated. Fasting of newborn pigs for 24 h reduced the intensity of the 43,000, 39,000, 34,000, and 24,000 Mr forms to 11.5%, 7.2%, 69.8%, and 5.2% of control levels, respectively. However, the 29,000 Mr IGF-BP was 1.8-fold higher in fasted pig serum than in that of fed controls. The band intensities of the 34,000 and 29,000 Mr forms were increased in postnatal animals after hypophysectomy. In contrast, fetal decapitation resulted in a preferential decrease in only the 34,000 Mr form, which was reduced by 30% compared to that in age-matched controls. These studies indicate that porcine serum contains six IGF-BPs that can be detected by ligand blotting. The level of each of these proteins increases with advancing gestational age, although the increases are not uniform, suggesting that the proteins may be regulated differentially. In the postnatal animal both endocrine and nutritional factors modulate the levels of IGF-BPs by distinct controlling mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulation of Leydig cells by the administration of a single injection of 100 IU human CG (hCG) to adult male rats caused a significant biphasic stimulation of serum testosterone levels at 2 h and 3 days after injection. Serum immunoreactive (IR)-inhibin levels were elevated by 6 h and peaked at 24 h after hCG, then progressively declined thereafter. The removal of Leydig cells in vivo by the injection of the cytotoxic drug ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS) causes a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels within 4 days, which is sustained 1 and 2 weeks after EDS. Serum IR-inhibin levels, however, rise significantly 2 and 4 weeks after injection of EDS. An injection of 100 IU hCG, 4 days after EDS (when no Leydig cells were present in vivo), failed to provoke an elevation of either testosterone or IR-inhibin levels in serum. But 2 or 4 weeks after administration of EDS, as a new population of Leydig cells develops in the interstitium, an injection of 100 IU hCG provokes a significant increase in serum testosterone and IR-inhibin levels. The possibility that the failure of IR-inhibin levels to rise after EDS and hCG treatment could be due to changes in the seminiferous epithelium, caused by testosterone deprivation induced by Leydig cell destruction after EDS, was examined by administering high doses of testosterone known to maintain spermatogenesis. Under such conditions, hCG failed to induce a rise of IR-inhibin after EDS treatment had destroyed the Leydig cells. These data strongly support the concept that the Leydig cells are involved in the regulation of IR-inhibin secretion in vivo through factors other than testosterone.\r"

  ".W": "These studies have examined the ontogeny of specific GH- and PRL-binding proteins in rabbit liver cytosol across the fetal, early neonatal, and adult periods. The precise hormonal specificity of binding of the somatotropic/lactogenic ligand, [125I]human GH, was determined by displacement with monoclonal antibodies against either rabbit mammary gland PRL receptors or liver GH receptors. The developmental changes were evaluated by gel filtration chromatography, which allowed a measure of both the extent of binding and the molecular size (Mr). Scatchard analysis indicated that fetal liver cytosol contained mostly high affinity PRL receptors (Ka, 13.78 +/- 0.98 nM-1; capacity, 127 +/- 24.0 fmol/g tissue; mean +/- SEM; n = 5) and was low in GH-specific binding. This contrasts markedly with adult liver cytosol, which is a rich source of GH receptors (Ka, 2.44 nM-1; capacity, 20,765 fmol/g tissue), but is low in PRL-specific binding. Despite the deficiency of GH receptors in fetal liver, an abundant receptor-like GH-binding protein was present in fetal serum. Of several fetal tissue cytosols examined, only the placenta contained significant GH-specific binding; no tissues other than liver contained PRL-specific binding. After parturition PRL receptors in liver cytosol increased and predominated up until day 3 (Ka, 27.97 +/- 6.27 nM-1; capacity, 495 +/- 95.09 fmol/g tissue; n = 7), a period during which GH-specific binding was increasing only slightly. By day 6 a striking switch-over occurred, and GH receptors, which had a 4-fold lower affinity, became predominant (Ka, 6.89 +/- 0.63 nM-1; capacity, 600 +/- 47 fmol/g tissue; n = 5), while PRL-specific binding fell dramatically to levels observed in adult liver cytosol. After day 6 GH receptors increased steadily, reaching the high levels observed in adulthood by 2 months (Ka, 3.95 nM-1; capacity, 16,300 fmol/g tissue; n = 2), while PRL-specific binding appeared to change little. Structural and immunological analyses of the cytosolic GH and PRL receptors in the fetal/early neonatal period revealed similarities with the adult liver cytosolic GH receptor and mammary gland cytosolic PRL receptor, respectively. The increase in GH receptors on day 6 was clearly illustrated by cross-linking studies which showed the emergence of a GH-specific binding protein structurally distinct from PRL-specific binding proteins. These studies have demonstrated that in the rabbit major changes occur in the GH/PRL receptor profile during the early period of growth and suggest that important developmental changes occur in the requirement for GH and/or PRL action during this period.\r"

  ".W": "Naturally occurring and synthetic flavonoids are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone 5'-deiodination and binding to human serum transthyretin (TTR) in vitro. We now describe the inhibitory effect of the most potent flavonoid, 3-methyl-4',6-dihydroxy-3',5'-dibromo-flavone (EMD 21388), on the serum protein binding of T4 and T3 and subsequent alterations of pituitary-thyroid function in the rat. Eight to 10 mumol/liter EMD 21388 added to pooled rat serum completely displaced [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 binding from TTR, the major thyroid hormone-binding protein in the rat, and markedly increased the percentages of free T4 and T3, measured by equilibrium dialysis. One to 4 h after the ip administration of 2 mumol EMD 21388/100 g BW to euthyroid rats, [125I]T4 and [125I]T3 binding to TTR decreased, serum T4 and T3 concentrations decreased, and the percentages of free T4 and free T3 increased. No changes were observed in the free T4 and free T3 concentrations. Serum TSH concentrations decreased at 1 h and were very low thereafter. EMD 21388 administration did not affect the elevated serum TSH concentrations in hypothyroid rats, strongly suggesting that the flavonoid does not directly affect TSH secretion. No changes were observed in hepatic type I 5'-deiodinase in euthyroid rats and pituitary type I and type II 5'-deiodinase in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats after EMD 21388 administration. We conclude that the ip administration of EMD 21388 to euthyroid rats inhibits T4 and T3 binding to TTR, with subsequent increases in the percentages of free T4 and free T3 and decreased serum T4 and T3 concentrations. The decrease in the serum TSH concentration was possibly due to transcient increases in the serum free T4 and/or free T3 concentrations, resulting in increased pituitary thyroid hormone content.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone biosynthesis depends upon the presence of adequate amounts of thyroidal iodine, and during fluctuations in dietary iodine intake, relatively constant thyroid hormone levels are maintained by various homeostatic mechanisms. These mechanisms include an enhancement of iodide pump efficiency and organification when iodine intake is limited, and significant decreases in iodide uptake and hormone synthesis when excess iodine intake occurs. The present study was designed to determine whether acclimation to different dietary iodine regimens is associated with changes in thyroid blood flow and to assess the time course of any such alterations in relation to pituitary-thyroid axis hormone levels. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing low (LID), high (HID), or normal (CTR) iodine concentrations. Three, 7, 14, or 133 days after starting these dietary regimens, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine/pentobarbital, and thyroid blood flows were assessed using the reference sample version of the microsphere technique. At the same times and at weekly intervals throughout the 133 days of treatment, blood samples for the determination of TSH, T4, and T3 levels were obtained. Additionally, thyroidal immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was measured at the end of the experiments. LID treatment increased thyroid blood flows to 240%, 350%, and 240% of levels in control rats at 7, 14, and 133 days of treatment, respectively. Thyroid weight was also elevated above levels in control animals at each of these times. A slight decrease in plasma T4 levels occurred over the 133 days of LID treatment; however, this dietary regimen did not alter circulating levels of T3 or TSH or thyroidal VIP concentration. HID treatment had opposite effects, in general, to those of LID. Thyroid blood flows were decreased by 34%, 56%, 46%, and 35% after 3, 7, 14, and 133 days of treatment with HID, respectively. Circulating levels of T4 were increased over the 133 days of HID treatment, whereas plasma levels of T3 and TSH and thyroid weights remained unchanged from those in control rats over this period of study. A small decrease in thyroidal VIP concentrations coincident with the decrease in thyroid blood flow was observed at the beginning of the HID treatment. Neither LID nor HID had any effect on blood pressure, cardiac output, or blood flow in other organs. These data demonstrate that acclimation to changes in dietary iodine intake in the rat include alterations in thyroid blood flow which are reciprocal to the iodine intake level and appear to be independent of circulating TSH levels.\r"

In both groups mast cells were present in the capsule of the testes and occasionally in vicinity of intratesticular blood vessels. Histamine stimulated T production in a dose dependent manner in incubations of regressed testes of SD animals, but had no stimulatory effect in the active testes of LD animals. In the incubations of SD testes, the effects of HA were abolished by the H-1 antagonist pyrilamine, but unaffected by the H-2 antagonist cimetidine. In both groups, HA enhanced the stimulatory effects of hCG. These results indicate that HA has steroidogenic activity in the testis and may be a factor involved in the regulation of Leydig cell function.\r"

The amino terminal peptide of CgA, CgA1-40, inhibited the secretion of PTHrP, whereas other peptides had no such effect. Human CT stimulated the secretion of PTHrP, whereas other hormones had no such effect. Both effects occurred in a dose-dependent manner. These studies reveal novel regulatory pathways among peptides and proteins that are commonly associated with each other and can have paracrine interactions. CgA may be processed at its multiple dibasic sites to peptides that regulate the secretion of its co-resident hormones, in this case PTHrP. In addition to a paracrine effect, CT may be clinically useful as a provocative agent for PTHrP secretion. Complex interactions are present among the calcium-regulating hormones and their associated proteins.\r"

To determine whether any of these hGH-V isoforms are glycosylated, the cell lines were grown in the absence and presence of tunicamycin. In addition, conditioned medium from metabolically labelled hGH-V transfected cells was separately digested with peptide:N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H. The 26 and 24 kD bands were both absent from the media after tunicamycin treatment and were both sensitive to peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment. Endoglycosidase H digestion resulted in the selective loss of the 24 kD band. These results indicate that hGH-V is partially modified posttranslationally by N-linked glycosylation in a fibroblastic cell line.\r"

  ".W": "The transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, a key step in steroidogenesis, is subject to hormonal modulation that, at least in part, could be mediated by protein phosphorylation. This step is stimulated by sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) and Ca2+. To explore whether SCP2 itself is a potential control point for regulation by Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation we investigated whether highly purified SCP2 could serve as a substrate for major type Ca2+ and non-Ca2+-dependent protein kinases. Phosphorylation by calmodulin protein kinase II (CaM-PK II), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) was monitored under optimal conditions for each enzyme. PKA, CaM-PK II and MLCK catalyzed the radiolabeling of histone 2A, synapsin I and myosin light chain (MLC), known substrates for these kinases, respectively, yet no phosphate transfer to SCP2 was observed. In contrast, PKC from two different sources (rat and calf brain) effectively catalyzed the phosphorylation of the highly purified SCP2. The phosphorylation of SCP2 depended on the addition of Ca2+ and phospholipids and was completely blocked by Polymyxin B, a PKC inhibitor. PKC catalyzed phosphorylation of SCP2 displayed a similar dependence on the concentration of ATP. Lineweaver Burk plots of the data indicate Km values for ATP of approximately 6 microM for the phosphorylation of SCP2. Our results, which have revealed for the first time that SCP2 is a substrate for PKC, are consistent with the possibilities that the control of steroidogenesis by tropic hormones and by PKC activation are mediated, at least in part, by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of SCP2.\r"

  ".U": "89289619\r", 
  ".W": "We, and others, have recently reported that the ovary is a site of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)I gene expression. It was the objective of the present studies to assess the relative ovarian abundance of IGF-I transcripts with alternative 5'-untranslated (UT) regions, their cellular localization, and hormonal regulation. To this end, a solution hybridization/RNase protection assay was employed wherein total rat ovarian RNA was hybridized with a 404-base 32P-labelled rat IGF-I riboprobe corresponding to the Class A 5'UT variant. As in liver, three protected bands [322 (Class A), 297 (Class B), and 242 (Class C) bases long] were noted, in keeping with established alternative 5' UT transcripts. The ovarian (as the hepatic) Class C variant proved the most abundant. The ovarian Class B variant was barely detectable. Cellular localization studies revealed these ovarian IGF-I transcripts to be primarily, if not exclusively, of granulosa but not theca-interstitial cell origin. Treatment of immature (21-23 days old) hypophysectomized rats with a diethylstilbestrol (DES)-containing subcutaneous silastic implant for a total of 5 days resulted in a 2-fold increase in the (densitometrically quantified) abundance of ovarian IGF-I transcripts, a diametrically-opposed effect (2.6-fold decrease) being noted at the level of the liver. Whereas treatment of hypophysectomized rats with oGH by itself (150 micrograms, qd, sc x5 days) resulted in a 5-fold increase in hepatic IGF-I gene expression, a limited, albeit distinct inhibitory effect was observed on the steady-state levels of ovarian IGF-I mRNA. In contrast, combined treatment with oGH and DES yielded a 3-fold increase in the abundance of ovarian IGF-I transcripts, there being no net alteration in hepatic IGF-I gene expression. Taken together, these findings reveal ovarian expression of the 3 known 5'-UT IGF-I mRNA variants, document the granulosa cell as the main somatic ovarian cell of IGF-I mRNA generation, and indicate that hepatic and ovarian IGF-I gene expression are differentially regulated in diametrically opposed directions.\r"

  ".U": "89289621\r", 
  ".W": "Previous results have shown that salmon calcitonin (sCT), a peptide in rat brain and pituitary gland, inhibits basal and TRH-stimulated PRL release and reduces PRL mRNA levels in isolated anterior pituitary cells of adult rats in culture. Rat milk contains a variety of neuropeptides and hormones, some of which are absorbed in bioactive form to exert endocrine influences in the developing offspring. The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether a CT-like peptide is present in rat milk. Circulating PRL levels in neonatal rats are low, and there is an abrupt increase in the basal secretion of this hormone at weaning. A second objective was to examine whether CT plays a role in the regulation of PRL secretion in neonatal animals. A sensitive and specific RIA for sCT was developed and used to assay rat milk on various days of lactation for sCT-like immunoreactivity. sCT-like activity was present in the water-soluble (infranatant) fraction of milk throughout lactation in concentrations as high as 1589 pg/ml. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoreactive levels of the peptide in milk samples from different days of lactation. sCT-like immunoreactivity in rat milk infranatant coeluted with synthetic sCT on reverse phase HPLC, and these HPLC fractions inhibited basal PRL release when added to cultures of anterior pituitary cells. This inhibition of PRL release by the sCT-immunoreactive HPLC fractions was comparable to that exerted by equivalent concentrations of synthetic sCT. Newborn rats were injected sc with 10 microliters normal rabbit serum or anti-sCT serum from the day of birth until postpartum day 10. The rats were killed on day 11, and their sera were analyzed for PRL. Anti-sCT-injected rats showed a significant increase in serum PRL levels compared to those in untreated or normal serum-treated rats. These results demonstrate that a CT-like peptide, which is a potent inhibitor of PRL release, is present in rat milk throughout lactation, and that passive immunization with a highly specific anti-sCT serum leads to an increase in serum PRL levels in neonatal rats. CT, possibly of milk origin, may be a physiologically relevant PRL-inhibiting factor during the neonatal period.\r"

Undifferentiated adrenocortical cells did not bind DIL-HDL3 or DIL-LDL. Differentiation induced by ACTH was accompanied by intense binding of DIL-HDL3 and DIL-LDL to plasma membranes of adrenocortical cells. Binding of DIL-HDL3 and DIL-LDL was saturable and specific, and resulted in enhanced secretion of corticosterone and 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone, indicating that the binding sites for these lipoproteins represented functional receptors. Binding of DIL-HDL3 to the surface of adrenocortical cells was detected 6 h after the start of ACTH stimulation, whereas binding of DIL-LDL could not be detected until 12 h after ACTH stimulation was started. Thus, in the ACTH-induced differentiation of adrenocortical cells from zona glomerulosa-type into zona-fasciculata type, exogenous lipoprotein cholesterol is needed for enhanced growth and steroidogenesis, and an initial event in the differentiation of these cells is the sequential expression of specific receptors for HDL3 and LDL.\r"

Blood flow was determined at 35 and 44 degree C at several sites on the upper and lower extremities with a temperature-regulated probe. Blood flow was highest at both temperatures on the pulps of the index finger and the first toe, regions of high density of arteriovenous anastomoses. There was significantly greater blood flow at most locations for the nondiabetic than the diabetic group at 35 degree C, and the differences between the two groups were substantially larger at 44 degree C. At 44 degree C, blood flow in the control group was approximately 40% greater in the upper extremity and 50% greater in the lower extremity than it was in the diabetic subjects. The differences were attributed to decreases of both microvascular volume and velocity in the diabetic group. In the upper extremity, volumes in the diabetic patients were 10-15% lower and velocities 10-40% lower than in the nondiabetic subjects. In the lower extremity, volumes were 20-25% lower and velocities 40-50% lower. We conclude that laser Doppler techniques can be used to assess microvascular changes in the skin of diabetic patients. This approach may be useful to evaluate and model diabetic microangiopathy.\r"

A control group of 13 healthy Caucasian men was also evaluated. Before treatment, diabetic subjects had low mean cell hemoglobin concentration values and increases in both erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels and erythrocyte hexokinase activities. Although all three of these changes are associated with a decrease in hemoglobin O2 (Hb-O2) affinity, P50 values were normal in diabetic subjects. Moreover, P50 values normalized to pH 7.4 (P50(7.4] were inversely related to the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Both erythrocyte 2,3-DPG and erythrocyte ATP were also inversely related to HbA1c. Vitamin B6 nutriture, as determined by erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, was normal in all diabetic subjects before vitamin B6 therapy. Nonetheless, HbA1c levels decreased after 6 wk of treatment with 150 mg/day pyridoxine and increased again during placebo administration. These changes were not explained by changes in fasting blood glucose. Pyridoxine therapy also decreased P50(7.4) values and increased erythrocyte AST and ALT activities but had no effect on 2,3-DPG, ATP, or the activities of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. These observations suggest that 1) nonenzymatic glycosylation may play a role in regulating both erythrocyte metabolism and Hb-O2 affinity in diabetic subjects, and 2) vitamin B6 therapy may modify nonenzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin in this population.\r"

It was recently reported that one of the best-known thymic hormones responsible for the maturation and differentiation of the thymus-derived T-lymphocyte line, i.e., serum thymic factor (STF), is biologically active only when bound to zinc ions; in this form it has been called thymulin (Zn-STF). Because low serum and tissue zinc values have been reported to occur in diabetic conditions, and because defects of T-lymphocyte-dependent functions are also present in diabetic patients, even metabolically well-controlled diabetic patients, we investigated the serum level of zinc and the plasma level of both active Zn-STF and inactive STF thymic hormones in 15 young patients suffering from type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes. Serum zinc levels were significantly reduced in diabetic conditions and did not correlate with the degree of metabolic compensation measured by glycosylated hemoglobin. In diabetes, the active form of thymulin is strongly reduced, whereas the inactive form is abnormally elevated. In vitro zinc addition to diabetic plasma samples also induces zinc saturation of inactive thymic hormone molecules: the total thymic hormone measured in these experimental conditions shows values in diabetic patients comparable with those observed in healthy age-matched individuals, suggesting that low thymulin levels recorded in diabetic conditions are due not to a thymic failure in synthesizing and secreting thymic hormone but to a peripheral defect in zinc saturation of the hormone molecules. The zinc-dependent failure of thymic hormone, present even in fairly compensated diabetic conditions, might account for the apparent insulin-independent immunological abnormalities associated with type I diabetes.\r"

This paper describes the development, testing and use of a mathematical model for predicting survival. The Cox regression method and comprehensive data from 312 Mayo Clinic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were used to derive a model based on patient's age, total serum bilirubin and serum albumin concentrations, prothrombin time and severity of edema. When cross-validated on an independent set of 106 Mayo Clinic primary biliary cirrhosis patients, the model predicted survival accurately.

  ".W": "The rate-limiting step in the overall plasma-to-bile transport of a saturating load of bilirubin is still a matter of controversy. We reassessed the apparent maximal biliary bilirubin excretion following i.v. infusion of unconjugated bilirubin and--for the first time--of highly purified bilirubin diglucuronide in the rat. The bilirubin diglucuronide preparation could be kept in a stable form at -20 degrees C for at least 2 months after addition of 3 mM sodium ascorbate. The biliary bilirubin excretion rates in animals with and without bile depletion in order to induce different flow rates were comparable after infusion of unconjugated bilirubin and of bilirubin diglucuronide. No significant hydrolysis of bilirubin diglucuronide seemed to occur during the hepatic transport of the pigment. Injection of bilirubin diglucuronide into rats which were already being infused with saturating doses of unconjugated bilirubin did not result in increased biliary bilirubin excretion. In contrast, a reversible inhibition of bilirubin output and bile acid-dependent bile flow was observed. If unconjugated and diglucuronidated bilirubin follow the same intracellular routes, the present results would suggest that conjugation did not restrict maximal biliary excretion. However, if exogenously administered diglucuronide utilizes a separate pathway, as was recently proposed, the biliary secretion of this exogenous conjugate might be restricted, presumably due to a toxic effect of the high local concentration of diglucuronide. The pathways utilized by the unconjugated pigment, on the other hand, could be primarily determined by the conjugating capacity.\r"

Whereas a bile duct to portal space ratio of 0.9 to 1.8 is cited by Alagille as the norm for children, there are no data regarding the normal bile duct to portal space ratio in preterm infants. In this study, by examining liver tissue obtained from autopsied fetuses and infants, we have determined that the bile duct to portal space ratio increases as a function of postconceptional age. After 38 weeks postconception, a ratio equal to or greater than 0.9 was seen in eight of nine subjects. Therefore, in evaluating premature infants for duct paucity, liver biopsies should be obtained only after 38 weeks. Prior to 38 weeks postconception, a bile duct to portal space ratio less than 0.9 may be physiologic.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human alpha-interferon is now under intensive investigation as therapy for chronic Type B hepatitis. Recent reports have suggested that prolonged alpha-interferon therapy may induce autoimmune reactions. We have evaluated the problem of autoimmunity related to alpha-interferon therapy by testing for 15 different antibodies in the sera of 31 patients treated with alpha-interferon. No patient had autoantibodies before treatment; 27 (87%) of 31 patients developed at least one autoantibody. Eleven patients had antinuclear antibodies and 21 had smooth muscle antibodies, both of which usually developed during alpha-interferon therapy. In contrast, antibodies to endocrine organs such as thyroid microsomal, thyroglobulin and parietal cell antibodies arose in 12 patients, but usually several months after alpha-interferon treatment. The appearance of these autoantibodies did not correlate with disease activity or response to alpha-interferon. No patient developed autoantibodies specifically associated with autoimmune liver diseases such as liver kidney microsomal antibodies, autoantibodies to soluble liver antigen and the primary biliary cirrhosis specific subtypes of antimitochondrial antibodies. These results suggest that prolonged alpha-interferon therapy can induce autoantibody production and, in susceptible patients, may lead to autoimmune disorders.\r"

Seventeen patients were given human lymphoblastoid interferon-alpha; the other 18 patients were given interferon-beta. We measured the activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in these mononuclear cells and found the rate of increase in vivo and in vitro; the correlation between the two was r = 0.68. This enzyme activity in the patients who became negative for DNA polymerase after interferon treatment increased more both in vivo and in vitro than in patients who did not became negative. Also, both the in vivo and in vitro activity increased more in patients who became negative for the e antigen after interferon therapy than in those who remained positive. In the first group, interferon was considered to be effective; in the second, ineffective. Of the patients who became negative, some developed e antibodies and some did not; the increase in this enzyme activity in the two groups was not significantly different. The increase in the activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity could be used to predict the results of interferon treatment and is an index that can be used before treatment to predict the response.\r"

The results were correlated with the presence of serum IgM anti-hepatitis D virus and hepatitis D antigen in liver biopsy specimens when available. Although there was a trend of positive correlation between serum hepatitis D virus RNA and IgM anti-hepatitis D virus, no statistical significance could be found. In the serum samples with hepatitis D virus RNA, 32% were found to be negative for IgM anti-hepatitis D virus. Therefore, in chronic hepatitis D virus, absence of IgM anti-hepatitis D virus does not rule out active viral infection, as suggested by previous studies. There was a strong correlation between serum hepatitis D virus RNA and hepatic hepatitis D virus antigen. These data indicate that detection of hepatitis D virus RNA in serum samples is a reliable noninvasive marker of active viral infection.\r"

The dose of HBsAg in the control vaccine as well as in the two complexed vaccine preparations could be reduced from the standard value (3 micrograms) to 0.6 micrograms per injection without affecting the antibody response in the vaccinees. Still lower dosages of HBsAg in the three vaccine preparations induced significantly lower but comparable anti-HBs responses. These results indicate that, in man, using a heat-inactivated plasma vaccine, addition of anti-HBs contained in hepatitis B immunoglobulin does not potentiate the immunogenicity of HBsAg.\r"

Seven neoplasms involving cervix (2), lymphatic tissue (1), breast (1), bladder (1), soft tissue (1) and unknown site (1) developed in seven patients after 116 +/- 23 months (range: 18 to 164 months). The incidence of extrahepatic neoplasm was 1 per 194 patient-years of surveillance, and the probability of tumor occurrence was 3% after 10 years. Tumor frequency was similar in men and women and the risk was 1.4-fold greater than that in an age- and sex-matched normal population (95% confidence interval, 0.6- to 2.9-fold normal). Patients with extrahepatic malignancy were not distinguished by age, sex, treatment regimen, cumulative duration of treatment (42 +/- 9 vs. 60 +/- 4 months, p = 0.7) or individual features of the liver disease. Five of the seven patients survived during 48 +/- 25 months of follow-up, including two patients who have lived for at least 5 years after the diagnosis of malignancy. We conclude that extrahepatic malignancy develops infrequently during long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Its occurrence is not related to the type or duration of treatment, and long-term survival after tumor detection is possible. The low but probably increased risk of extrahepatic neoplasm does not militate against the use of immunosuppressive therapy in these patients.\r"

After 4 hr of plating, cells were preincubated with monensin (1 microM) for 1 hr before their incubation with horseradish peroxidase for different times. Monensin treatment resulted in the dilatation of the Golgi apparatus and caused the appearance of numerous intracellular lumina lined with microvilli in associated as well as isolated hepatocytes but did not modify newly formed bile canaliculi. The frequency of their appearance increased to 28% in cells pretreated with monensin compared to 2% in controls. Intracellular lumina membranes had the morphological features of apical membranes and were stained with horseradish peroxidase more frequently than those of newly formed bile canaliculi. This work therefore provides a model for studying bile secretion in cultured hepatocytes. Our results also suggest that the biliary transport of horseradish peroxidase does not involve the Golgi apparatus, since horseradish peroxidase was never observed in the Golgi stacks even after monensin treatment.\r"

On sections, the pericental zone (zone 3) is circular and discrete rather than star-like and reticular, as predicted by the acinar concept, whereas the periportal zone (zone 1) is reticular, i.e. contiguous between adjacent acini rather than discrete. Three-dimensionally, the composite of pericentral zones (the pericentral compartment) follows the branching pattern of the terminal hepatic (central) vein, whereas the composite of periportal zones (the periportal compartment) envelops the pericentral compartment as a three-dimensional network (reticulum). This modified concept that is based upon the three-dimensional distribution of hepatocyte-specific enzymes is supported by data from the literature regarding the three-dimensional angioarchitecture of the liver, the perfusion pattern of the liver and the three-dimensional pattern of tissue oxygenation. Hence, a unified concept of the liver architecture that is based upon the observed distribution pattern of blood flow, of gene expression and of metabolism can be established.\r"

We therefore examined the effects of phorbol esters and diacylglycerol, agonists of the protein kinase C branch of the phosphoinositide cascade, on perfusion pressure and bile flow in a single-pass, hemoglobin-free, isolated perfused rat liver system with constant perfusate flow. The active phorbol ester, 12,13-phorbol dibutyrate, produced a dose-dependent (maximal effect at 10(-6) M), sustained and reversible decrease in bile flow from 1.09 +/- 0.18 to 0.61 +/- 0.09 microliters per min per gm liver (37.2 +/- 5.9%) while simultaneously increasing perfusion pressure from 12.3 +/- 0.7 to 21.5 +/- 2.5 cm H2O (74.0 +/- 4.3%). Both effects were inhibited by the synthetic protein kinase C antagonist H-7. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a diacylglycerol, produced changes in bile flow and perfusion pressure that were similar to, but more marked than, those caused by 12,13-phorbol dibutyrate, whereas the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate and the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide had no effects on either parameter. 12,13-Phorbol dibutyrate infusion resulted in reversible decreases in oxygen consumption (23.3%) and a reversible vascular redistribution of trypan blue dye but did not alter hepatic venous effluent concentrations of K+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In normal liver, moderate amounts of alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen transcripts were found in sinusoidal cells, in stromal cells of the portal tracts and in the vicinity of central veins, whereas a1(IV) procollagen gene expression was below the threshold of detection. After 2 weeks of CCl4 treatment, increased transcription of alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen genes was observed in sinusoidal cells. At this stage, alpha 1(IV) procollagen mRNA was detectable in the same cell types and localization as alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen transcripts, although with a weaker signal. After 4 weeks, newly formed fibrous septa showed many cells intensely labeled by alpha 2(I), alpha 1(III) and alpha 1(IV) procollagen probes. Neither in normal liver nor at any stage of fibrosis was any hybridization signal above background observed in hepatocytes. These patterns suggest that in the liver Type I, Type III and Type IV procollagen expression takes place predominantly in nonparenchymal cells. Therefore, hepatocytes do not appear to be significantly involved in procollagen production in this experimental model of liver fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1982 and 1987, selective regional cancer chemotherapy using Lipiodol plus an anticancer drug (lipiodolization) was prescribed for 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. One hundred forty-nine patients were given lipiodolization alone, and the remaining 51 underwent hepatic resection following lipiodolization. The grades of deposits of the oily contrast medium in the neoplastic tissue seen on the plain X-ray correlated well with the antitumor effect. In the resected specimens of 17 patients treated with lipiodolization prior to surgery, concentrations of adriamycin in the malignant liver tissues were 13.2 +/- 18.2 micrograms per gm, whereas the adjacent liver parenchyma contained 1.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms per gm of adriamycin; the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). In the 149 patients treated with lipiodolization, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year survival rates were 56.1, 28.9, 17.3 and 7.4%, respectively. Thus, lipiodolization was considerably more effective, compared to the results achieved by hepatic artery ligation and cannulation into the hepatic artery for patients in Stages I and II. In this sequential nonrandomized study, the survival rates for patients undergoing hepatic resection were superior to those for patients in Stage I and treated with lipiodolization. The significant difference appeared to depend on incomplete killing of tumor cells, which are most often present in the fibrous capsule, by lipiodolization. We conclude from these data that lipiodolization is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma when the tumor is not curatively resectable. When the clinical status is good, then surgery is warranted.\r"

Carbachol (1 microgram/kg) or physostigmine (50 micrograms/kg) induced a long-lasting increase in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate in Long-Evans rats whereas no bradycardia was observed in Brattleboro rats, and the pressor response was significantly less than that in Long-Evans rats. The cardiovascular responses to nicotine (30 micrograms/kg) in Brattleboro rats were not different from those in Long-Evans rats. Intravenous vasopressin antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me) arginine vasopressin, significantly attenuated the pressor response and eliminated the bradycardic response to carbachol in Long-Evans rats. However, the pressor response to carbachol in Brattleboro rats was still significantly less than that in Long-Evans rats treated with vasopressin antagonist. Intravenous phentolamine partially inhibited the pressor response to carbachol in Long-Evans rats and completely eliminated it in Brattleboro rats. Combined intravenous treatment with phentolamine and vasopressin antagonist completely eliminated the pressor response to carbachol in Long-Evans rats. Centrally administered methylatropine eliminated either the hypertensive or bradycardic response to carbachol in Long-Evans rats. These results indicate that the pressor and bradycardic response to carbachol or physostigmine is mediated by the central muscarinic receptor mechanism. Hypertensive response to intracerebroventricularly administered carbachol in normal rats is mediated both by an increase in central sympathetic outflow and in circulating vasopressin. The bradycardia seems to be mediated mainly by vasopressin.\r"

We have studied the kinetics of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine, plasma beta-thromboglobulin, and basal, cytosolic, and free calcium, as correlates of platelet function. Fifteen untreated patients with essential hypertension and without detectable atherosclerosis, 18-40 years old, were compared with 30 matched normotensive control subjects. Maximal rates of platelet aggregation (Vmax) with ADP and epinephrine were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.03), as assessed by quenched-flow aggregometry. However, significance was lost when Vmax was corrected for the platelet count. Paradoxically, the activation constants (Ka) for ADP were higher in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.03). With ADP as the inducing agent, onset time (t) or lag period before aggregation begins was longer in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.02). beta-thromboglobulin levels, an index of in vivo platelet activation, were not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.13). The mean platelet cytosolic free calcium concentration was higher in patients (213 +/- 19 nM) than in control subjects (172 +/- 14 nM), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). However, there was a close correlation between the free calcium level and systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (p less than 0.003, p less than 0.04, p less than 0.004, respectively). No difference in platelet volume between the two groups was found. Our data suggest that platelets in the early stages of essential hypertension display an overall increased aggregation potential but a diminished sensitivity to ADP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long-term effects of a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CS-622, on Ca2+-dependent tone in aortic smooth muscles of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined. CS-622 (3 or 10 mg/kg/day), when orally administered to SHR for 21 weeks, exhibited a dose-dependent antihypertensive action. In Krebs-Henseleit solution, removal of Ca2+ caused much greater relaxation in aortas excised from control SHR than those from SHR treated with CS-622. Restoration of Ca2+ from zero to 2.5 mM elicited a marked contraction in aortas from control SHR but only a small contraction in aortas from both CS-622-treated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings suggested that myogenic tone that resulted from increased Ca2+ permeability in aortas of SHR was suppressed by long-term treatment with CS-622. The aortic tone from the individual rats correlated well with systolic blood pressure in both CS-622-treated and control SHR. The exaggerated myogenic tone in aortas of SHR was attenuated in the medium containing nicardipine but was not altered in the presence of CS-622 diacid (active form of CS-622) at a concentration high enough to fully inhibit aortic ACE. The myogenic tone in normal Ca2+ concentration was not decreased in aortas excised from SHR treated with hydralazine (5 mg/kg/day) for 21 weeks. We conclude that after prolonged administration CS-622 reduced the high vascular tension resulting from increased Ca2+ permeability of vascular smooth muscle membrane in SHR and that the restoration of normal Ca2+ permeability of vascular smooth muscles may underlie long-term antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that the increase in coronary artery perfusion pressure associated with systemic hypertension could also contribute to increased left ventricular filling pressures by acutely increasing coronary intravascular volume and decreasing left ventricular diastolic compliance. Isolated isovolumic (balloon in left ventricle) normal rabbit hearts (n = 13) with pericardium removed and right ventricle vented were blood perfused at an initial coronary artery perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg; left ventricular balloon volume was adjusted to produce an initial left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 +/- 1 mm Hg; left ventricular systolic pressure was 102 +/- 3 mm Hg. When coronary perfusion pressure was increased to 130 +/- 1 mm Hg to simulate a hypertensive crisis, coronary flow increased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 3.0 +/- 0.2 ml/min/g left ventricle (p less than 0.001), left ventricular systolic pressure increased to 116 +/- 4 mm Hg, and isovolumic left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased to 21 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), which indicated a decrease in left ventricular diastolic compliance. When coronary perfusion pressure was decreased to a physiological level of 70 mm Hg, coronary flow rate decreased to 1.4 +/- 0.1 ml/min/g left ventricle (p less than 0.001), left ventricular systolic pressure fell to 82 +/- 4 mm Hg, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were also used for comparison. Substituting alcohol (5-20%) for drinking water at 1 month of age retarded the age-dependent rise of blood pressure in all three strains so that, at 7 months, blood pressure measured by a tail-cuff method was 24 mm Hg, 26 mm Hg, and 41 mm Hg lower in the alcohol-treated WKY rats, SHR, and SHRSP, respectively, than in untreated rats. Significant differences in blood pressure were seen in each strain after only 3 months. Withdrawal of alcohol at this stage caused an acute rise of blood pressure then a return to subnormal levels, which persisted for a further 3 months. Administration of 15% alcohol to adult WKY rats and SHR for 2 months had no significant effect on blood pressure. Increasing alcohol content to 20% for a further 2 months prevented rises of blood pressure in both strains. Thus, although continuous drinking of alcohol does not lower blood pressure, it appears to counteract the development of hypertension in rats.\r"

In the SHR, restricted dietary calcium resulted in elevations of mean arterial pressure that were most pronounced during handling and restraint stress (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between SHR on intermediate and high calcium diets and no dietary effects in the WKY rats. Resting and stressed levels of circulating catecholamines did not differ across diet conditions in either strain. The SHR on low calcium diets had significantly larger pressor responses to infused norepinephrine (p less than 0.05). There were no differences between the rats on intermediate and high calcium diets. The results indicate that differences observed in blood pressure reactivity across diets in this study may have been a consequence of altered postsynaptic sensitivity rather than an increase in norepinephrine release.\r"

There were no significant differences in blood pressure changes among the groups. In the hypertensive group and in patients with the highest blood pressure there were individual falls in systolic pressure, particularly in the group receiving 10 mmol daily CaCO3. In the hypertensive group the changes were: with placebo, -3 +/- 2/-2 +/- 2 mm Hg; with CaCO3 (10 mmol), -7 +/- 3/-2 +/- 2 mm Hg; and with CaCO3 (20 mmol), -2 +/- 3/1 +/- 2 mm Hg. No change was significant, and no pressure changes of patients taking CaCO3 differed significantly from changes of patients taking placebo. Ten of 33 patients taking placebo, 11 of 31 taking 10 mmol/day CaCO3, and nine of 31 taking 20 mmol/day CaCO3 were classified as responders from their systolic blood pressure fall. These response rates did not differ. Eight patients had falls of systolic blood pressure greater than 15 mm Hg. Five were on 10 mmol/day CaCO3 and three on 20 mmol/day CaCO3. This response was significantly different from that with placebo. Univariate analyses failed to reveal any predictive dietary or biochemical parameter. After 3 months of not taking CaCO3, 12 patients classified as responders, including six of the eight with a fall of 15 mm Hg or more, were rerandomized to placebo or to 20 mmol/day CaCO3. In the rechallenge, responses to CaCO3 and placebo were similar, neither causing a significant pressure fall. Calcium carbonate did not reduce blood pressure. The apparent response in a few patients was not verified by rechallenge. The present study does not support calcium supplementation as a useful nonpharmacological measure for reducing elevated blood pressure.\r"

We used 8 g NaCl/100 g soluble nutrients and fed only a hypertonic (1.4% NaCl) or a hypotonic (0.45% NaCl) drink to Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. After 12 weeks, 11 rats receiving the hypertonic drink had a mean blood pressure of 195 mm Hg versus 195 mm Hg in 12 rats receiving the hypotonic drink. Thus, the high-NaCl signal seems unrelated to a higher NaCl concentration in extracellular fluid, thereby suggesting volume signals. Most volume controls are near the third brain ventricle (3V). As a working hypothesis, high dietary NaCl may swell the tissues surrounding 3V, which is slitlike. Such swelling would partially close the upper part of the slit and cause ependymal cells and nerve fibers on opposite walls to touch, possibly leading to hypertension in susceptible humans or rats. To test this, we stereotaxically blocked the aqueduct with inert silicone to produce hydrocephalus of 3V in DS rats and thus prevent ependymal cells and nerve fibers from touching. After blocking or sham-blocking the aqueduct, either a 6% NaCl diet or a 0.23% NaCl diet was started. Intra-arterial blood pressure was taken after 6 weeks. A group of 28 sham-blocked rats and a group of 29 blocked rats, all fed a 0.23% low NaCl diet, had equal blood pressures averaging 130 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies in Lichstein's laboratory suggest that the endogenous digitalislike substance implicated in low renin hypertension might be a steroidal dienolide derivative. If this is true, the bufadienolides should block potassium vasodilation and enhance norepinephrine vasoconstriction, constrict blood vessels, raise blood pressure, and produce natriuresis and diuresis. We have therefore examined these parameters while infusing bufalin (aglycone), a bufadienolide, intrabrachially and intravenously in the anesthetized dog. Intrabrachial infusion of 5-25 micrograms/min with brachial arterial blood flow held constant at 100 ml/min produced a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure with rapid onset and offset, a progressive decrease in the vasodilator response to intrabrachial injection of 1 ml iso-osmotic potassium chloride solution (but not to acetylcholine), and an increase in the vasoconstrictor response to intrabrachial injection of 0.1 microgram norepinephrine. Intravenous infusion at 5-50 micrograms/min produced a dose-dependent increase in systemic arterial blood pressure, rate of change of ventricular pressure (dP/dt), and after the highest dose, cardiac irregularities. Natriuresis and diuresis were not observed. Thus, bufalin does in fact have some of the physiological properties required to be considered a candidate for the digitalislike substance found in low renin hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to cause hypertrophy of cultured quiescent rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This observation along with the recent demonstration of angiotensinogen messenger RNA (mRNA) in the vessel wall has led us to postulate a role for Ang II in hypertensive smooth muscle hypertrophy. One of the earliest responses in a wide variety of cells in response to a growth-promoting agent is the induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos. To investigate the mechanism of the action of Ang II, we investigated the effect of Ang II on the expression of the c-fos gene in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that were made quiescent by being grown in a defined serum-free media for 48 hours. Ang II (10(-6)-10(-10) M) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in c-fos mRNA expression. This induction was angiotensin-receptor specific since it was completely abolished by the competitive inhibitor saralasin. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not block the rise in c-fos mRNA expression; it resulted in a superinduction and stabilization of the c-fos mRNA. Using a nuclear runoff transcription assay, we demonstrated that Ang II stimulated the transcription rate of the c-fos gene. This activation of c-fos gene expression may be an important mechanism in the angiotensin-induced smooth muscle hypertrophy.\r"

Labeled tyrosine was incorporated into dopamine and its main neuronal metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid as well as into norepinephrine. Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and norepinephrine, but not dopamine, generation was linear with time under basal and stimulated conditions. However, norepinephrine incorporation remained similar before and after cholinergic stimulation of ganglionic neurons. Only young, prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats showed altered responses when compared with their controls. Although endogenous dihydroxyphenylacetic acid content and baseline tyrosine incorporation into dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were lower in 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats than in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats, cholinergic stimulation increased labeled dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid generation significantly more in juvenile spontaneously hypertensive rats. Such a hyperresponsiveness was not observed in either young Dahl rats or in any of the other models when they became hypertensive. These results probably reflect a genuine hyperreactivity of postganglionic noradrenergic neurons to acetylcholine or their increased catecholamine-synthesizing ability after centrally evoked enhanced sympathetic outflow known to occur during the early development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

It is uncertain, however, whether the abnormalities are associated with hypertension per se or whether they may be concentrated in a particular subset of hypertensive subjects. In the present study, maximal rates of Li-Na countertransport were measured in red blood cells of 82 white subjects, including 37 normotensive subjects and 45 normal- or high-renin hypertensive subjects previously classified as non-modulators (n = 21) or modulators (n = 24). Mean countertransport activity was significantly higher in non-modulators compared with normally modulating hypertensive or normotensive subjects (0.475 +/- 0.044 vs. 0.309 +/- 0.028 or 0.249 +/- 0.012 mmol/l cell x hr, respectively, p less than 0.001). Modulators did not differ significantly from normotensive subjects with regard to mean countertransport activity. Red blood cell sodium pump and Na-K-Cl cotransport were not significantly different in modulating and non-modulating hypertensive subjects. These relations remained unchanged after adjusting for age, body weight, and plasma cholesterol levels by analysis of covariance. A countertransport value exceeding 0.50 mmol/l cell x hr occurred in 40% of the non-modulators but in only one of the other subjects. In contrast , while one half of the modulators and normotensive subjects had a countertransport value less than 0.235 mmol/l cell x hr, none of the non-modulators did. Thus, elevated countertransport appears to aggregate in the non-modulating subset of essential hypertensive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of unexpected significant improvement in renal function in patients from both groups, which changed the perspectives on the course of this disease as described herein, this report is being published before completion of the trial. The selection criteria were 1) serum creatinine concentration of 1.6-7.0 mg/dl, 2) glomerular filtration rate of less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 3) absence of diseases (other than hypertension) known to destroy renal function. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate [( 125I]iothalamate clearance) and serum creatinine concentration. Before randomization, DBP was aggressively treated to reduce it to less than 80 mm Hg. Twenty-two subjects (14 in the strict DBP control group and eight in the conventional DBP control group) have been enrolled in the study for 36 months. In contrast to results from previous studies in humans and rats, renal function improved in both patient groups. Thus, irrevocable progression of renal damage after onset of renal failure from high blood pressure does not necessarily occur, and in fact, long-term improvement of renal function resulted from the effects of the study itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 1,609, 8,110 patient-years) or a thiazide diuretic (n = 1,625, 8,070 patient-years). At randomization, 535 patients in the metoprolol group and 524 patients in the diuretic group were classified as smokers. Blood pressure control during follow-up was equally effective regardless of smoking habits at randomization. Cardiovascular and coronary heart disease mortality was three to four times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, underlining the importance of smoking as a risk factor. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for the metoprolol group than for the thiazide diuretic group in the whole study population (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012), as well as in smokers (p = 0.013 and p = 0.016). Coronary heart disease mortality was significantly lower for patients on metoprolol than for patients on diuretics in the whole study population (p = 0.048) as well as in smokers (p = 0.021). The results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of total, cardiovascular, and coronary heart disease mortality as compared with initial diuretic treatment, both in the whole study population and in smokers. The favorable effect of metoprolol must be mediated via mechanisms other than the blood pressure-lowering effect of metoprolol because equal blood pressure control was achieved with both types of medication, irrespective of smoking habits at randomization.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioid peptides have been implicated in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether the opioid antagonist naloxone alters the cardiovascular or renal responses produced by environmental stress (air stress) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Before naloxone administration, air stress produced significant increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and renal sympathetic nerve activity, and it caused a decrease in urinary sodium excretion. After intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration of naloxone, the air stress-induced pressor and antinatriuretic responses were inhibited. Subsequent studies with a different opioid antagonist, the quaternary compound naltrexone methylbromide, also showed inhibition of the air stress-induced pressor and antinatriuretic responses and demonstrated opioid receptor specificity of this inhibition. Furthermore, since only intracerebroventricular and not intravenous administration of naltrexone methylbromide inhibited the pressor and antinatriuretic responses to air stress, a central nervous system site of action was established. The opioid antagonists caused inhibition of the pressor and antinatriuretic responses to air stress without affecting the air stress-induced increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity. Our investigations indicate that central endogenous opioid peptides contribute to the pressor and antinatriuretic responses that occur in conscious SHR during acute environmental stress.\r"

The present study sought to determine whether the integrity of this area was necessary for the development of stress-induced hypertension in the borderline hypertensive rat (BHR). Male BHRs were assigned to three groups at 8 weeks of age: 1) AV3V lesion, 2) sham lesion, and 3) maturation control. BHRs with AV3V and sham lesions were exposed to 12 weeks of conflict stress (2 hr/day, 5 days/wk). At the end of the conflict protocol period, direct measurement of resting mean arterial pressure indicated that BHRs with sham lesions had significantly higher blood pressure (153 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) than rats with AV3V lesions (126 +/- 5.2 mm Hg) and maturation control rats (133 +/- 4.3 mm Hg). Although AV3V lesions prevented stress-induced hypertension in BHRs, these rats were still capable of transiently raising blood pressure. Specifically, the results also indicate that BHRs with AV3V lesions showed greater increase in blood pressure in response to an electric foot-shock paradigm. This study suggests a critical role for this forebrain region in the production of stress-induced hypertension in genetically predisposed animals.\r"

During control, 30-minute volume expansion, and 2-hour recovery periods, arterial blood pressure and heart rate did not change. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow remained stable throughout control and recovery. The amount of the volume load excreted as either water or sodium was the same for Dahl salt-sensitive and Dahl salt-resistant rats with either denervated or innervated kidneys. The time course of water and sodium excretion was similar in Dahl salt-sensitive and Dahl salt-resistant rats. Renal sympathetic nerve activity, however, showed different patterns. Although the initial decrease in renal sympathetic nerve activity during volume expansion was similar for both groups, Dahl salt-sensitive rats exhibited a prompt return of renal sympathetic nerve activity to control levels, whereas renal sympathetic nerve activity in Dahl salt-resistant rats remained decreased throughout the recovery period. The rapid recovery of renal sympathetic nerve activity to control levels after volume expansion in Dahl salt-sensitive rats supports the concept of impaired cardiopulmonary receptor function in these rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Activation of cells with histamine and vasopressin resulted in a prompt though transient rise in [Ca2+]i 10- to 12-fold higher than the resting [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i then declined rapidly during the first 30-40 seconds after hormonal stimulation and then gradually decreased to near resting levels in 2-3 minutes in the continued presence of hormones. The magnitude of the increase in peak [Ca2+]i was similar in buffered salt solution containing 1.8 mM Ca2+, zero Ca2+, and zero Ca2+ buffered salt solution containing 10 mM La3+, suggesting that receptor-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i is primarily due to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. Addition of La3+ produced oscillations in [Ca2+]i in approximately half the cells in response to both hormones. Addition of 10 microM forskolin did not significantly affect the resting [Ca2+]i, the hormone-stimulated peak [Ca2+]i, or the time course of hormone-stimulated [Ca2+]i transients. These data suggest that mechanisms involved in A-kinase-mediated smooth muscle relaxation may be subsequent to the changes in [Ca2+]i. Activation of C-kinase by 1 microM 12 deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate-20 acetate (DPBA) did not affect the resting [Ca2+]i, though it attenuated the histamine and vasopressin-mediated peak elevation in [Ca2+]i. Since DPBA inhibited the peak [Ca2+]i response to both the hormones to the same extent, it would appear that C-kinase activation may uncouple the receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C.\r"

Both radioligands displayed single components on Scatchard analysis. The specific binding of [3H]prazosin was of high affinity (0.54 +/- 0.04 nM) with a maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 212 +/- 15 fmol/mg protein. The maximum number of [3H]rauwolscine binding sites was 64 +/- 4 fmol/mg of protein with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.60 +2- 0.27 nM. Binding of both radioligands was rapid, saturable, and specific. alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the intrarenal arterial membrane preparation were also characterized at 2-, 4-6-, and 10-12-week intervals during the course of development and maintenance of chronic two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertension and in age-matched sham-operated normotensive control rabbits. The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor affinity for [3H]prazosin binding in hypertensive rabbits was significantly increased in the stenotic, but not contralateral, kidney at 2 weeks; however, at 6 weeks the receptor affinity of both kidneys was significantly increased compared with those of the normotensive control group. No difference in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor affinity was seen at 12 weeks, and there were no changes in Bmax at any of the weekly intervals. Neither the Kd, nor Bmax, for [3H]rauwolscine in either kidney showed a significant difference between hypertensive rabbits and normotensive control rabbits.

We used microfluorometry to measure cGMP-induced changes in intracellular calcium and pH of cultured A7r5 VSM cells after stimulation with contractile agonists. A cGMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP, blocked vasopressin- but not thrombin-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i. High extracellular potassium concentrations [( K+]) increased [Ca2+]i, but the attenuation of [Ca2+]i by 8-Br-cGMP was not statistically significant. 8-Br-cGMP also attenuated vasopressin- but not thrombin-stimulated alkalinization of VSM cells. cGMP may decrease vascular tone by decreasing [Ca2+]i and pH, but these changes are dependent on the contractile agonist studied.\r"

The MSNA was significantly greater in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive subjects, irrespective of activity units (p less than 0.01), and this finding was consistent in the young (30 years old or less), middle-aged (31-50 years old), and old groups (51 years old or more). Furthermore, MSNA showed a significant positive correlation with age both in the normotensive subjects (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01 for burst rate; r = 0.49, p less than 0.01 for burst incidence; and r = 0.50, p less than 0.01 for spike frequency) and in the hypertensive patients (r = 0.40, p less than 0.01 for burst rate; r = 0.44, p less than 0.01 for burst incidence; and r = 0.40, p less than 0.01 for spike frequency).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Decreased baroreceptor reflex sensitivity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The purpose of this study is to determine if alterations of baroreceptor function precede the development of hypertension in humans. Baroreceptor function was evaluated in 13 young adult white men with relatively high blood pressures sustained for 12 to 15 years and 12 age-matched men with sustained relatively low blood pressures. High pressure baroreceptor activity was evaluated by measuring change in pulse interval in response to decreases and increases of arterial pressure, induced by graded infusions of nitroprusside and angiotensin II, respectively. In response to both agents, baroreceptor slopes did not differ in the high and low blood pressure groups. Plasma norepinephrine also increased similarly in both blood pressure groups in response to nitroprusside. To study low-pressure baroreceptor function, responses to graded levels of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) were measured. Comparing both blood pressure groups, there were similar increases of heart rate, total peripheral resistance, and plasma norepinephrine in response to LBNP. Both blood pressure groups also had similar increases of heart rate and blood pressure in response to isometric (handgrip) exercise. Thus, high-pressure and low-pressure baroreceptor function is not altered in prehypertensive young adults. However, continued follow-up will be required to determine if these individuals with sustained relatively high blood pressures are truly prehypertensive.\r"

In this paper, we studied these responses in 13 unselected hypertensive subjects in whom the family history of hypertension had been carefully detailed. Nine of these 13 subjects had a positive family history (FH+) for hypertension and had significantly smaller decrements in renal blood flow with Ang II infusion than the four subjects who had a negative family history (FH-) (-84 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2 for FH+ vs. -149 ml/min/1.73 m2 for FH-, p = 0.024). These FH+ subjects also showed smaller increases in renal blood flow with increases in dietary sodium than FH- subjects (7 +/- 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 72 +/- 24 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; p = 0.014). When classified as modulators or non-modulators by previously established criteria, all seven non-modulators were FH+, and seven of nine FH+ subjects were non-modulators. This association between non-modulation and family history of hypertension is significant (p = 0.021). To further clarify the association between non-modulation and family history of hypertension, we have studied the renal blood flow response to Ang II in 31 hypertensive siblings from 14 sibships. Twenty-five of these 31 subjects (81%) behaved as non-modulators (p = 0.008 compared with expected value in an unselected hypertensive population). Additionally, strong concordance of non-modulation between sibling pairs was observed (p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systolic blood pressure was higher in SHR (174 +/- 12 mm Hg) than in WKY rats (132 +/- 4 mm Hg): 1) In the presence of 10 microM phentolamine, 10 microM verapamil, and 5 mM caffeine, reduction of ionized extracellular sodium concentration [( Na+]o) from normal (139.2 mM) to 1.2 mM (replaced by N-methyl-D-glucamine) caused an external Ca2+-dependent increase in tonic tension (calcium entry by Na-Ca exchange).

Vasopressin was extracted from cells and evaluated by radioimmunoassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Radioimmunoassay of high-pressure liquid chromatography fractions from cell extracts showed that the major peak of immunoreactivity comigrated with synthetic vasopressin. Cell vasopressin content increased in a graded manner when one to six dishes (plated 8 x 10(6) cells/dish) were pooled (8.7 +/- 0.5 to 67.7 +/- 8.2 pg/dish). When the number of plated cells per dish was increased (2 to 16 x 10(6) cells), there was also a graded rise in dish vasopressin content (3.4 +/- 0.4 to 15.3 +/- 3.9 pg). Treatment of cultures with 100 aM to 1 nM of angiotensin II for 5 minutes caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell vasopressin content. Furthermore, the decrease in cell vasopressin content of cultures treated with 1 nM angiotensin II (12.6 +/- 0.8 to 7.0 +/- 1.0 pg/10(6) cells, p less than 0.05) corresponded with the increase in medium vasopressin concentration (3.8 +/- 0.5 to 7.5 +/- 2.3 pg/ml) and this vasopressin-releasing effect of angiotensin II was blocked by [Sar1, Thr8]angiotensin II. Treatment of cultures with potassium chloride (56 mM) and acetylcholine chloride (5.5 microM) also resulted in significant decreases in cell vasopressin content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and III were measured by radioimmunoassay and indicated drops with leucine aminopeptidase M infusion in SHR (from 36 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 1 pg/100 microliters) and in WKY rats (from 33 +/- 9 to 13 +/- 1 pg/100 microliters). Pretreatment with the specific angiotensin receptor antagonist [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II (sarthran) significantly diminished the subsequent leucine aminopeptidase M-induced decreases in blood pressure in SHR and facilitated recovery to base level blood pressure and heart rate in blood strains. Thus, exogenous application of leucine aminopeptidase M into the brain lateral ventricles of SHR is temporarily effective at reducing blood pressure, and this effect appears dependent on the brain angiotensinergic system. This treatment also reduced blood pressure in WKY rats; however, pretreatment with sarthran was reasonably ineffective at preventing subsequent leucine aminopeptidase M-induced decreases in blood pressure.\r"

Previously we reported that very high dietary calcium (4.0% vs. 0.4%) lowers mean arterial pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive rats. However, we have recently observed that more moderate calcium supplementation (2.0% vs. 0.4%) increases mean arterial pressure in DS rats. To further evaluate the pressor action of 2.0% versus 0.4% calcium, we tested for effects of 2.0% calcium in female DS rats fed low (0.2%), moderate (1.0%), and high (2.7%) sodium and in Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats fed high sodium from 6 to 12 weeks old (n = 10-13 rats per group). At 12 weeks, 2.0% calcium increased mean arterial pressure and the cardiac ventricular weight/body weight ratio in DS rats fed high sodium (p less than 0.05) but not in DS rats fed low or moderate sodium or in DR rats fed high sodium. Ganglionic blockade decreased mean arterial pressure in all groups but failed to abolish or attenuate the difference in mean arterial pressure between high sodium-fed DS rats on 2.0% and 0.4% calcium diets. In the same DS rats fed a high sodium diet, 2.0% calcium increased systemic pressor responsiveness to graded norepinephrine administration after ganglionic blockade. Thus, 2.0% supplemental calcium intake enhances salt-induced hypertension in DS rats. This prohypertensive action of 2.0% calcium is dependent on a critically high level of between 1.0% and 2.7% sodium in the diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although central administration of arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been reported to increase arterial pressure mediated by activation of the sympathetic system, we found that peripheral blockade of sympathetic transmission did not attenuate this pressor response. To elucidate the mechanism, rats were pretreated with either phentolamine (3 mg/kg), chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg), a vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (AVP-X) (10 micrograms/kg), or the combinations of phentolamine and AVP-X or chlorisondamine and AVP-X. The pressor response to intracerebroventricular injection of AVP in unrestrained conscious rats was reduced but not significantly altered by intravenous injection of phentolamine or AVP-X; however, combined treatment with these agents abolished the response. To determine that the amount of central AVP leaked to the periphery did not contribute to the pressor effect, tritiated AVP and AVP (100 ng total) were injected intracerebroventricularly. Blood samples collected at 0, 3, and 30 minutes after injection showed that radioactivity in plasma was primarily metabolites and that the amount of intact AVP estimated to leak from the brain was too low to produce a pressor effect. Comparative regional hemodynamic studies between intracerebroventricular and intravenous injection of AVP performed in conscious rats instrumented with Doppler flow probes demonstrated a qualitatively similar pattern of increased resistance in the renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters beds. These data suggest that central pressor action of AVP is mediated by both activation of the sympathetic system and release of AVP.\r"

Impairment of dilatation generally has been attributed to hypertrophy of the vessel wall with encroachment on the vascular lumen. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a reduction in external diameter may contribute to encroachment on the vascular lumen during chronic hypertension. We examined 10-12-month-old, anesthetized Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). External diameter, stress, and strain of pial arterioles were calculated from measurements of pial arteriolar pressure (servo null), diameter, and cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall. During maximal dilatation produced with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall was greater in SHRSP than in WKY rats (2,038 +/- 57 vs. 1,456 +/- 61 micron 2, p less than 0.05). External, as well as internal, diameter was less in SHRSP than in WKY rats (101 +/- 3 and 88 +/- 3 micron in SHRSP vs. 111 +/- 3 and 102 +/- 3 micron in WKY rats for external and internal diameter, respectively, p less than 0.05). Reduction in external diameter accounted for 76% of encroachment on the lumen in SHRSP, and hypertrophy per se accounted for only 24%. Distensibility of deactivated pial arterioles was increased in SHRSP. These findings suggest that reduction in external diameter plays an important role in impairment of maximal dilatation of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP, and reduction in vascular diameter in SHRSP cannot be accounted for by altered distensibility. We propose that, during chronic hypertension, cerebral arterioles undergo structural remodeling that results in a smaller external diameter and encroachment on the vascular lumen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-two hypertensive patients without hypertrophy had normal end-systolic wall stress at rest and exercise responses. In contrast, the 18 patients with echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy demonstrated a significant increase in end-systolic wall stress at rest compared with normal subjects (69 +/- 16 vs. 55 +/- 15 10(3) x dyne/cm2, p less than 0.05) despite having normal resting left ventricular size and ejection fraction. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, the increase in ejection fraction with exercise was less than in the normotensive control subjects (7 +/- 7 vs. 12 +/- 8 units, p less than 0.05), and delta systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume with exercise was reduced (3.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 8.3 +/- 7.7 mm Hg/ml/m2, p less than 0.05). The hypertensive patients with hypertrophy displayed a shift downward and to the right in the relation between systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume ratio and end-systolic wall stress compared with control subjects and hypertensive patients without left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by echocardiography and normal resting ejection fraction exhibit abnormal ventricular functional responses to exercise. This finding may have implications in identifying patients at higher risk for developing heart failure.\r"

Twelve patients of mean age 58 years (range 44-73 years) with essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) took active therapy for 12 weeks, separated by a 2-4 week placebo period. Carotid pressure waveforms were recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry with a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. PWV was measured between carotid and femoral arteries (aortic PWV), carotid and radial arteries (arm PWV), and femoral and pedal arteries (leg PWV). Early wave reflection was calculated from the ratio of the height of the peak of the carotid wave above its shoulder to the pulse pressure and was expressed as an augmentation index. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing brachial sphygmomanometric pressure and PWV in all three regions (active vs. placebo, p less than 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the two active therapies. However, the augmentation index (averaged during the treatment period) was significantly lower with dilevalol (19%) than with atenolol (28%, p less than 0.01), corresponding to a greater decrease of 5-8 mm Hg in carotid systolic pressure compared with the brachial artery. Although both drugs were equally effective in reducing arterial distensibility, the vasodilating action of dilevalol gave added benefit in reducing wave reflection, presumably through its vasodilatory effect on peripheral conduit arteries.\r"

In one group (13 subjects), measurements were first done in warm conditions and repeated 5-7 months later in cold conditions; in the second group (nine subjects) a reverse sequence was followed. Blood pressure was measured under casual conditions during a hand grip exercise test, mental arithmetic test, and submaximal multistage bicycle exercise test; during the following 24 hours, blood pressure was measured serially with a noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure recorder. Daily outdoor maximum and indoor laboratory temperatures were also obtained. In the cold season, significantly higher values (on the average by 5-10 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) were obtained in both groups for mean diastolic daytime blood pressure. For other measurements, a trend toward higher values in the cold season was observed in both groups, although statistical significance was not obtained in all instances. For nighttime measurements, irrespective of the seasonal sequence, lower values were observed in the second session. Significant correlations were found between the differences in the average daytime ambulatory blood pressures and the corresponding changes of daily maximum outdoor temperatures after 5-7 months. These observations indicate that arterial blood pressure may be strongly influenced by environmental temperature. This phenomenon should be taken into account both in the evaluation of the individual hypertensive patients and in the design and analysis of studies on arterial hypertension, especially when ambulatory blood pressure techniques are employed.\r"

In addition, responses to a cold pressor test, handgrip, and the Valsalva maneuver were recorded before and after exercise. Four subjects were also studied before and after \"sham\" exercise. Sham exercise had no effect on blood pressure or sympathetic nerve activity whereas resting systolic blood pressure was lower after treadmill exercise in seven subjects (from 136 +/- 4 before to 123 +/- 2 mm Hg 60 minutes after exercise; p less than 0.01). Sixty minutes after exercise, sympathetic nerve activity was lower in all seven subjects (from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 bursts/min, p less than 0.015; or from 27 +/- 3 to 14 +/- 2 bursts/100 heartbeats, p less than 0.005) but was slightly increased in the two subjects without postexercise hypotension.

When nitroprusside was infused in five subjects to produce a reduction in systolic blood pressure similar to that seen 60 minutes after exercise, this drug increased sympathetic discharge from 37 +/- 6 to 57 +/- 4 bursts/100 heartbeats (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arteriolar density was determined by stereologic techniques. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly elevated in the 2K1C rats, rising to 186 +/- 6 mm Hg by 8 weeks compared with 113 +/- 4 mm Hg in controls. Lumens of larger arterioles showed a structural reduction at 2 weeks of hypertension and remained at the same level through 8 weeks, while arterioles of control rats showed a progressive increase in diameter with age (101 +/- 6 microns in 2K1C vs. 158 +/- 8 microns in controls at 8 weeks after operation). Wall-to-lumen ratios of larger arterioles were significantly increased at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of hypertension, but cross-sectional wall area was significantly reduced at 8 weeks. Medial hypertrophy was not evident at any stage of hypertension. Arteriolar rarefaction of smaller arterioles was functional at 2 weeks and structural at 8 weeks of hypertension. Vascular tone of the smaller arterioles was elevated in the developing and chronic stages of hypertension. At 2 weeks of hypertension when the structural reduction in diameters of larger arterioles was progressing, the increased vasoconstriction and functional rarefaction may have contributed to the elevated resistance. At 8 weeks, the marked diameter reductions of larger arterioles (36% in first-order arterioles and 25% in second-order arterioles) account for most of the increased resistance to flow.\r"

The tissues of two rats, a spontaneously hypertensive and a WKY control rat, were simultaneously processed and subjected to the same electrical stimulation. Both absolute and fractional overflow of endogenous norepinephrine during periarterial nerve stimulation (5 and 10 Hz for 1 minute) in the tissue of 7-week-old SHR was significantly greater whereas overflow of 13-week-old SHR was equivalent as compared with that of the age-matched WKY rats. The tissue content of norepinephrine was 20-25% higher in SHR of both ages. There was significantly enhanced [3H]norepinephrine uptake in the tissues of young SHR, but no difference was observed in the older SHR. The pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation was significantly enhanced in 7-week-old SHR and much more so at the older age as compared with the WKY control rats. Exogenous norepinephrine dose-response curves in the tissues of 7-week-old SHR exhibited a parallel leftward shift, characteristic of a change in sensitivity, whereas that of 13-week-old SHR showed a much steeper slope as compared with the respective WKY control rats. This finding suggests that in addition to smooth muscle supersensitivity, structural alterations had occurred in vasculature of 13-week-old SHR. These data indicate that in SHR both the exocytotic release of norepinephrine and the responsiveness of the vascular smooth muscle cells are enhanced in the developmental stage of hypertension whereas smooth muscle supersensitivity to norepinephrine and nonspecific structural alterations primarily contribute to the maintenance of hypertension at 13 weeks of age.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors in slow-twitch, oxidative skeletal muscles (soleus) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at three different ages. The investigation was based on the hypothesis that the increase in Na+ content and decrease in fatigue resistance observed previously in the soleus of SHR might be the result of a down regulation of muscle beta-receptors. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle stimulates sarcolemmal sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, which produces an efflux of Na+ and an influx of K+. Receptor down-regulation would be expected to reduce hormonal stimulation of Na+ pump activity, particularly during exercise. The results of receptor binding studies, however, and an investigation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in response to applied epinephrine indicated that there were no significant differences in receptor properties in the soleus muscles of SHR and WKY rats. Receptor number and affinity were the same in the two strains, and the rate, magnitude, and duration of the increase in cAMP in response to 10(-6) M epinephrine were also similar. beta-Adrenergic receptor down-regulation does not appear to be a generalized phenomenon in tissues of SHR, despite the appearance of other physiological changes in the tissue.\r"

The pressor response to AVP (20 ng/kg/min for 3 hours) was relatively well maintained in WKY but showed an age-dependent tachyphylaxis in SHR. After cessation of the infusion, arterial pressure of SHR fell in all age groups. In contrast, withdrawal of AVP in WKY resulted in little or no hypotensive response. Thus, a withdrawal-induced antihypertensive phenomenon (WAP) to AVP was specific to SHR. The magnitude of the WAP was significantly correlated with the level of initial blood pressure in SHR (r = -0.81, p less than 0.001). The magnitude of the tachyphylaxis during the AVP infusion was also correlated with the level of initial blood pressure in SHR (r = -0.66, p less than 0.001). Accordingly, a significant correlation was found between the magnitude of the WAP and the degree of tachyphylaxis to the pressor activity of AVP in SHR (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001). The significance of this is unknown, but it might mean that a common underlying mechanism existed in the expression of the tachyphylactic phenomenon and the WAP in SHR. Finally, an apparent enhancement in the baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was observed in both SHR and WKY during the infusion of AVP, but the magnitude of this enhancement appeared to be greater in SHR than in WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In tissues rich in kallikrein, vasodilator kinins, acting as paracrine hormones, may play a role in the local regulation of blood flow. We studied the role of kinins in the regulation of blood flow in the rat submandibular gland using a kinin analogue with antagonistic properties, [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5-8[DPhe7]bradykinin. When infused into the carotid artery (20 micrograms/min/rat), this antagonist blocked the effect of bradykinin (25-250 ng/kg, intracarotid injection) on glandular blood flow. In nephrectomized rats, the antagonist also blocked the increase in glandular blood flow caused by enalaprilat, a kininase II converting enzyme inhibitor. At a dose of 20 micrograms/min/rat, the antagonist produced no detectable change in basal glandular blood flow; however, at a higher dose (100 micrograms/min/rat), it caused a significant decrease (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 rats, blood flow decreased by 75% or more; this effect was not blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. After antagonist infusion was stopped, blood flow returned toward normal. Sympathetic nerve stimulation of the gland induced vasoconstriction followed by poststimulatory vasodilatation. In rats displaying severe vasoconstriction after the antagonist, postsympathetic vasodilatation was abolished even when stimulation was performed after the antagonist infusion had been stopped and blood flow returned toward normal. Although a direct vasoconstrictor effect of the kinin antagonist cannot be completely ruled out, these data suggest that, in the rat submandibular gland, kinins may play a role in regulation of basal blood flow and vasodilatation after converting enzyme inhibitor or sympathetic stimulation.\r"

We have investigated the regulatory mechanisms of these peptides on norepinephrine release in rat hypothalamic slices in vitro. Neuropeptide Y and galanin significantly inhibited the stimulation-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release in a dose-dependent manner (1 Hz: S2/S1 ratio (mean +/- SEM), control 0.947 +/- 0.040, n = 11, neuropeptide Y 1 x 10(-8) M 0.509 +/- 0.013, n = 8, p less than 0.01, neuropeptide Y 1 x 10(-7) M 0.283 +/- 0.021, n = 8, p less than 0.01; galanin 1 x 10(-7) M 0.448 +/- 0.026, n = 8, p less than 0.01, galanin 1 x 10(-6) M 0.261 +/- 0.023, n = 8, p less than 0.01). The inhibition of norepinephrine release by the alpha-2 agonist UK 14,304 was potentiated by neuropeptide Y and galanin. The blockade of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by RX 781094 diminished the inhibitory effects of neuropeptide Y and galanin on norepinephrine release. Pretreatment of hypothalamic slices with islet activating protein (a toxin that interferes with the coupling of inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase) attenuated the suppression of norepinephrine release by UK 14,304, neuropeptide Y, and galanin. These results support the idea that neuropeptide Y and galanin are involved in the regulation of central adrenergic transmission partially mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and islet-activating protein-sensitive guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins in rat hypothalamus.\r"

The renal vasodilator response to the calcium channel blocking agent diltiazem, but not the response to alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (teprotide or captopril), was associated with a significant reduction in the amplitude of renal vasomotion. Acetylcholine, a vasodilator that acts through the release of a vasorelaxant factor or factors from endothelium, induced an unanticipated increase in renal vasomotion. These observations further dissociate factors responsible for basal renal vascular tone and periodic changes in renal vascular tone and raise the possibility that abnormalities in the flux of calcium into renal arterioles contribute to increased renal vasomotion in essential hypertension.\r"

This is shown by the fact that after starting HD the peripheral granulocytes are less stimulable to chemiluminescence (CL) and peroxide production (cytochrome C reduction). Such alterations are likely to be connected with a granular staining loss, enzyme release and sequestration of granulocytes in the lung, which coincides with reported clinical features like dyspnoea and drop in arterial oxygen pressure. HD with polysulfone membranes causes a degranulation reaction too, but does not produce granulocyte inhibition and pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes, clearly indicating that these phenomena strongly depend on the different dialyzer membranes.\r"

The study was terminated after three days and autopsy was performed on the calves. Left ventricular unloading provided by both devices was complete (LVEDP less than 1 mmHg) and identical. LV bypassed flow rate was higher in CP (0.045 L/min/kg) than in UTAH 85 VAD (0.035 L/min/kg) but with no statistical difference. Blood trauma was comparable in the two groups. Daily blood samples did not show any significant changes from baseline values in creatinine, hematocrit, fibrinogen. Platelet loss from initial level was 30%; serum lactate dehydrogenase rose 150% with no significant difference in the two groups; plasma free hemoglobin never reached significant values. At autopsy, thrombotic deposits on cannuale and renal infarction rate were similar. CP housing had to be changed every day, whereas no technical failure was ever observed with the UTAH 85 VAD. Clinical response and blood damage of the two pumps used as LVAD were the same. Considering the CP has to be replaced every 24 h, the cost of three CP's would be comparable to one Utah UVAD-85 if polyurethane tricusp semi-lunar valves are used in the latter. Until the UTAH-85 VAD becomes commercially available, simple valveless low-cost CP are very attractive for short-term mechanical support.\r"

Ascitic fluid is drained by gravity in a unit consisting of an Amicon D-30 ultrafilter and a bag used as transit reservoir placed below the patient. When the bag is full, it is raised to a height sufficient to let the fluid flow back through the filter to the peritoneal cavity. Mainly during this step ultrafiltration of ascitic fluid occurs through the membrane of the filter. Ultrafiltration is enhanced by the negative pressure created in the filtrate compartment due to the height difference between filter unit and filtrate drainage bag placed at the bottom of the machine. Proteins in the ascitic fluid are retained and returned to the abdominal cavity. The machine cycle is automatically repeated as many times as necessary to achieve the scheduled patient weight loss. 17 patients have been treated for a total of 1.94 sessions/patient with reinfusion of the fluid in the abdominal cavity. In all patients a significant reduction of the amount of ascitic fluid and of its rate of formation have been achieved. The treatment was well tolerated and no side effects were observed. After treatment the diuresis and the sodium excretion increased significantly in all patients. The system is safe and reliable for the treatment of refractory ascites without major complications.\r"

When either MCT or HCO was fed in the absence of cholesterol, there was little effect on receptor-dependent LDL transport but a 36-43% increase in LDL-cholesterol production. Cholesterol feeding in the absence of triacylglycerol led to significant suppression of receptor-dependent LDL transport and a 26-31% increase in LDL-cholesterol production. However, when the longer chain-length saturated triacylglycerol was fed together with cholesterol there was a marked increase in the suppression of receptor-dependent LDL transport and an 82% increase in production rate. Together, these two alterations accounted for the observed eightfold increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, feeding the shorter chain-length saturated triacylglycerol with cholesterol actually enhanced receptor-dependent LDL transport while also causing a smaller increase (52%) in the LDL-cholesterol production rate. As a result of these two opposing events, MCT feeding had essentially no net effect on plasma LDL-cholesterol levels beyond that induced by cholesterol feeding alone.\r"

We studied the function of CETP in vivo in rabbit lipoprotein metabolism using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb, TP1) to CETP. Rabbits were injected with TP1 (n = 8), or irrelevant MAb or saline (control, n = 8), resulting in an initial 71% inhibition of CETP, which fell to 45% after 48 h. HDL CE rose in the inhibited animals, reaching levels that doubled initial and control values at 48 h (P less than 0.001). HDL TG fell reciprocally, but HDL protein did not change, suggesting a CE for TG exchange. VLDL CE/TG decreased. Rabbits were also given [3H]cholesteryl ether HDL (a CE analogue). CETP inhibition delayed the initial clearance of radioactivity from HDL (control 6.8 vs. TP1 4.1 pools/d) and plasma (7.8 vs. 5.2 pools/d). We conclude that CETP plays a quantitatively important role in HDL CE catabolism in the rabbit, promoting the exchange of TG for CE and the clearance of CE from plasma.\r"

Derepressed rates of bile acid synthesis (30-54 h) were inhibited by an infusion of taurocholic acid only at a supraphysiological dose of 500 mumol/kg per h, but not at 300 mumol/kg per h, which approximates the initial bile acid secretion (250 mumol/kg per h). When administered together with taurocholic acid (200 mumol/kg per h) only a high dose of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (100 mumol/kg per h) decreased taurocholic but not tauromuricholic or taurochenodeoxycholic acid synthesis. The only bile acid suppressing taurocholic acid (36-71%) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (up to 33%) formation at an infusion rate close to the normal portal flux was deoxy- or taurodeoxycholic acid at 15-50 mumol/kg per h. It may be concluded that deoxycholic acid and possibly other secondary bile acids are much more potent inhibitors than primary bile acids.\r"

  ".W": "Because alveolar fibrin is a prominent histologic feature of diffuse lung injury in baboons, we hypothesized that local abnormalities of pathways of fibrin turnover would favor fibrin deposition in the alveolar space. To test this hypothesis, procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities were characterized in serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of baboons with evolving diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) induced by exposure to 100% O2. BAL procoagulant activity, characterized mainly as the tissue factor-Factor VII complex, was markedly increased after induction of DAD. Extrinsic pathway inhibitor was likewise increased in BAL during evolving DAD but was insufficient to control coagulation. Urokinase-like fibrinolytic activity was usually detectable in baseline BAL but was undetectable after 7 d of O2. DAD BAL contained significantly increased plasminogen levels, plasmin inhibitor activity sufficient to neutralize all plasmin produced by BAL plasminogen activator found in control BAL and detectable plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Antiplasmin activity was due, in part, to increased alpha 2-antiplasmin. These changes correlated with quantitatively increased alveolar fibrin deposition demonstrated by histologic and morphometric analyses. Multiple abnormalities of pathways of fibrin turnover occur concurrently in the alveolar compartment of the lungs of baboons with DAD, which collectively predispose to diffuse alveolar fibrin deposition.\r"

  ".W": "Human small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and cell lines derived therefrom are phenotypically heterogeneous concerning neuroendocrine differentiation. Unlike most SCLC tumors and cell lines that express poorly differentiated neuroendocrine phenotypes, the SCLC cell line DMS 53 exhibits mature endocrine differentiation features, including unusually high expression of the gene for the peptide hormone, calcitonin (CT). We now report that introduction of the viral Harvey ras (v-rasH) oncogene into DMS 53 cells via retroviral infection, with resultant constitutive expression, results in increased features of neuroendocrine differentiation. 7-10 d after infection the cells demonstrated altered morphology, increased CT secretion, increased CT gene expression, markedly diminished cellular proliferation, and nearly abolished methylcellulose cloning efficiency. This response of DMS 53 cells to v-rasH is unlike the tumor progression effects we have previously observed in other SCLC lines. Significantly, the differentiation response that follows expression of the virally introduced v-rasH oncogene in DMS 53 cells is similar to that of neoplastic neuroendocrine cell lines derived from adrenal pheochromocytes and thyroid C cells. The effects of constitutive v-rasH expression in DMS 53 SCLC cells and other neuroendocrine cell lines suggest an important role for rasH or related genes in neuroendocrine differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Tryptophan ethyl ester, a lipid-soluble tryptophan derivative, was used to bypass defective gastrointestinal neutral amino acid transport in a child with Hartnup disease. The child's baseline tryptophan concentrations in serum (20 +/- 6 microM) and cerebrospinal fluid (1.0 +/- 0.2 microM) were persistently less than 50% of normal values. Cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a serotonin metabolite, was also less than 50% of normal (21 +/- 2 ng/ml). Serum tryptophan concentrations increased only modestly and briefly after an oral challenge with 200 mg/kg of oral L-tryptophan, reflecting the absorptive defect. An oral challenge with 200 mg/kg of tryptophan ethyl ester resulted in a prompt increase in serum tryptophan to a peak of 555 microM. Sustained treatment with 20 mg/kg q6h resulted in normalization of serum (66 +/- 15 microM) and cerebrospinal fluid tryptophan concentrations (mean = 2.3 microM). Cerebrospinal fluid 5-HIAA increased to more normal concentrations (mean = 33 ng/ml). No toxicity was observed over an 8-mo period of treatment, chronic diarrhea resolved, and body weight, which had remained unchanged for 7 mo before ester therapy, increased by approximately 26%. We concluded that tryptophan ethyl ester is effective at circumventing defective gastrointestinal neutral amino acid transport and may be useful in the treatment of Hartnup disease.\r"

HMWK antigen (237 +/- 61 ng HMWK/10(8) neutrophils) was present in lysates of washed human neutrophils. Little if any plasma HMWK was tightly bound and nonexchangeable with the neutrophil surface. Human neutrophils were found to possess surface membrane-binding sites for HMWK but no internalization was detected at 37 degrees C. 125I-HMWK binding to neutrophils was dependent upon Zn2+. Binding of 125I-HMWK to neutrophils was specific and 90% reversible. 125I-HMWK binding to neutrophils was saturable with an apparent Kd of 9-18 nM and 40,000-70,000 sites per cell. Upon binding to neutrophils, 125I-HMWK was proteolyzed by human neutrophil elastase (HNE) into lower relative molecular mass derivatives. Furthermore, HMWK found in neutrophils also served as a cofactor for HNE secretion because neutrophils deficient in HMWK have reduced HNE secretion when stimulated in plasma deficient in HMWK or with purified kallikrein. These studies indicate that human neutrophils contain a binding site for HMWK that could serve to localize plasma or neutrophil HMWK on their surface to possibly serve as a receptor for kallikrein and to participate in HNE secretion by this enzyme.\r"

We investigated PNM lipids as putative antigens for these Ab since GBS serum retained significant reactivity to PNM treated with protease. Ab binding to specific lipids was studied with a C1 fixation and transfer (C1FT) assay using fractions of PNM lipid reincorporated into liposomes as antigen targets or to lipids on HPTLC plates with peroxidase-labeled goat Ab to human IgM. Reactivity was detected to a neutral glycolipid (NGL) of human PNM with a similar number of carbohydrates residues to that of Forssman hapten (Forss). Anti-NGL Ab titers in GBS patients (50-220 U/ml) were significantly elevated over disease and normal controls (0-5 and 0-6 U/ml). We studied possible antigenic cross-reactivity of these Ab with Forss by first quantitating Ab activity with C1FT assay and liposomes containing Forss. All 12 GBS sera tested showed titers (54-272 U/ml) significantly elevated over 11 disease controls (0-22 U/ml) and 25 normal controls (0-11 U/ml). GBS serum Ab reacted with Forss isolated from dog nerve or sheep erythrocytes on HPTLC plates. Further, absorption of 80-100% of anti-NGL Ab activity and 17-97% of anti-PNM Ab activity from eight GBS patient serums was accomplished with liposomes containing Forss but not with control liposomes. In seven GBS patients anti-NGL Ab activity represented only a portion of anti-PNM Ab activity. These results suggest that a glycolipid with antigenic cross-reactivity to Forssman hapten may be responsible for some of the anti-PNM Ab activity in GBS.\r"

In isolated hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, coronary flow rate (CFR) was estimated under nonworking conditions. During maximal vasodilation after 1 min-ischemia, CFR at a coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) of 100 mmHg and CFR/myocardidial mass at CPPs of 100 and 150 mmHg decreased significantly (72 +/- 5%; 53 +/- 4 and 61 +/- 4% of controls). 1 or 4 wk after debanding, LV systolic pressures were similar to control values, and the degree of myocardial hypertrophy decreased to levels 23 +/- 6 (P less than 0.01) and 11 +/- 6% (P less than 0.01) above their control values, respectively. At 1 wk there was no significant increase in CFR/myocardial mass, compared to values in the banded group (67 +/- 8 vs. 53 +/- 4% of controls at 100 mmHg and 67 +/- 9 vs. 61 +/- 4% at 150 mmHg of CPP). At 4 wk, CFR and the ratio had increased toward normal. Thus, decreased coronary perfusion in hypertrophied hearts is completely reversible.\r"

To examine its functional behavior, mutant molecule-rich soluble subfractions that partly or fully lacked their normal A peptide were obtained from cryoprecipitates or from incoagulable material, respectively. Such subfractions consistently induced a more pronounced decrease (n = 3) in the turbidity of normal polymerizing fibrin than that induced by normal fibrinogen, by whole phi SB (n = 4) or by fibrinogen from an unrelated homozygous proband. These subfractions also exhibited decreased (12-50% of normal controls, fibrinogen 30-590 nM, n = 5) ADP-induced aggregation support of gel-sieved platelets, a decrease not demonstrable by whole phi SB, by fibrinogen from the homozygous proband, or by enrichment of the latter with normal soluble fibrin. A single isolate displaying diminished platelet aggregation support was 125I-labeled and examined further. It exhibited decreased binding to platelets, and Scatchard analysis indicated decreased binding affinity but normal maximum binding. We infer that phi SB contained heterodimers that exhibited these distinct functional properties when their normal A peptide had been cleaved.\r"

To examine the cellular mechanism of this increase in activity, LPL activity, immunoreactive mass, and mRNA level were measured in lean and obese subjects both before and 4 h after a carbohydrate-rich meal. Heparin-releasable (HR) LPL activity was approximately 2.5-fold higher in the 15 obese subjects, when compared with six lean subjects. However, there was no difference in LPL immunoreactive mass between the lean and obese subjects. In response to the meal, there was a 2.2-fold increase in total adipose tissue LPL activity in the lean subjects due to an increase in both the HR fraction, as well as the adipose fraction extracted with detergents. However, no increase in LPL immunoreactive mass was observed in any adipose tissue LPL fraction, resulting in an increase in LPL specific activity in response to the meal. In the obese subjects, there was no significant increase in LPL activity in response to feeding, and also no increase in immunoreactive mass or specific activity. After extraction of RNA, there was no difference in either the relative proportion of the 3.6- and 3.4-kb human LPL mRNA transcripts, nor in the quantity of LPL mRNA in response to feeding. Thus, these data suggest that the increase in LPL activity under these conditions occurs through a posttranslational activation of a previously inactive LPL precursor.\r"

Baseline pHi was higher (7.28 +/- 09) in +HCO3- than in -HCO3- (7.16 +/- 0.14). Blocking Na+/H+ exchange with amiloride had no effect on pHi in +HCO3- but caused reversible 0.1-0.2-U acidification in -HCO3- or in +HCO3- after preincubation in the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS). Acute Na+ replacement in +HCO3- alos caused acidification which was amiloride independent but DIDS inhibitible. The recovery of pHi from an intracellular acid load (maximum H+ efflux rate) was 50% higher in +HCO3- than in -HCO3-. Amiloride inhibited H+ effluxmax by 75% in -HCO3- but by only 27% in +HCO3-. The amiloride-independent pHi recovery in +HCO3- was inhibited 50-63% by DIDS and 79% by Na+ replacement but was unaffected by depletion of intracellular Cl-, suggesting that Cl-/HCO3- exchange is not involved. Depolarization of hepatocytes (raising external K+ from 5 to 25 mM) caused reversible 0.05-0.1-U alkalinization, which, however, was neither Na+ nor HCO3- dependent, nor DIDS inhibitible, findings consistent with electroneutral HCO3- transport. We conclude that Na+-HCO3- cotransport, in addition to Na+/H+ exchange, is an important regulator of pHi in rat hepatocytes.\r"

We identified the 41-kD endoflagellar antigen to be a single polypeptide with an apparent isoelectric point (pI) of 6.5 by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis. This polypeptide, which we designated P41F alpha, was heavily labeled by 125I in 2-D autoradiographs of B. burgdorferi whole-cell lysates and was recognized by a murine monoclonal antibody (MCB1) and human antisera in 2-D immunoblots. NH2-terminal sequence analysis showed 80% homology between P41F alpha and the 33-kD endoflagellar protein of Treponema pallidum. Results of indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), Triton X-114 phase partitioning, and agglutination studies suggested a possible surface exposure of the polypeptide. Silver stained 2-D gels also revealed the presence of another 41-kD species, with an apparent pI of 6.6 (designated P41 beta), which was not radioiodinated in 2-D autoradiographs, and was not recognized by MCB1 or human antisera. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of P41 beta revealed no homology with P41F alpha, leading to the conclusion that they are not related.\r"

  ".W": "Dermal fibroblasts from a patient with CHILD syndrome (an acronym for congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects) were obtained and successfully maintained in culture. Fibroblasts from an area of chronically hyperkeratotic skin were compared with fibroblasts from the corresponding contralateral area of normal skin in regard to proliferative activity and to both unstimulated and stimulated generation of PGE2, an eicosanoid with documented effects on both epidermal cell and fibroblast function. Compared with the uninvolved skin fibroblasts, those from involved skin showed (a) a slower rate of proliferation, (b) a cyclical pattern of PGE2 synthesis, and (c) an approximately 20-fold greater synthesis of PGE2 in response to human purified IL-1, a cytokine known to be secreted by epidermal keratinocytes. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the cyclical generation of PGE2 by the involved skin fibroblasts is responsible for their slower rate of growth when compared with the uninvolved skin fibroblasts. These data document a phenotypic dichotomy between the uninvolved and involved skin fibroblasts in CHILD syndrome that may be exploited to increase our understanding of the nature of dermal influences that may affect epidermal growth and differentiation.\r"

To examine the nature of this receptor, human monocytes were obtained by counter-current elutriation and were found to adhere to immobilized fibronectin but not to vitronectin or von Willebrand factor. Antibodies and peptides were used to determine whether monocyte adherence to immobilized fibronectin was mediated by a receptor similar to that which mediates the adherence of fibroblasts to fibronectin. Antibodies against both the alpha and beta subunits of the fibroblast fibronectin receptor (VLA-5) inhibited monocyte adherence to fibronectin. These antibodies immunoprecipitated two surface proteins from monocytes that migrated at 140 and 120 kD under nonreducing conditions. Surface proteins with identical apparent molecular weights were immunoprecipitated from surface-labeled MG-63 cells, a fibroblast-like cell line. A synthetic peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sequence also inhibited monocyte adherence to fibronectin. cDNA hybridization experiments revealed the presence of mRNA for both the alpha and beta subunits of the fibroblast fibronectin receptor in human monocytes. We conclude that circulating monocytes express a fibronectin receptor that is structurally and functionally very similar, if not identical, to the fibronectin receptor in adherent fibroblasts, and that this receptor mediates monocyte adherence to immobilized fibronectin.\r"

In these studies, we investigated whether primary cultures of CF respiratory epithelial cells regulate abnormally the sulfate content of high molecular weight glycoconjugates (HMG) participating in airways' mucosal defense. HMG, including glycosaminoglycans and mucin-type glycoproteins released spontaneously into medium and HMG released from cell surfaces by trypsin, were metabolically labeled with 35SO4- and [6-3H]-glucosamine (GlcN) or 35SO4- and [3H]serine. All three classes of HMG from CF cells exhibited 35S/3H labeling ratios 1.5-4-fold greater than HMG from normal or disease control cells. Differences for labeling ratios of HMG from CF cells were shown to be the consequence of increased 35SO4- incorporation rather than decreased peptide synthesis and release or HMG glycosylation. The buoyant density of CF mucin-type HMG also was increased, consistent with increased sulfation. These observations suggest that oversulfation of a spectrum of HMG is a genetically determined characteristic of CF epithelial cells and may play an important pathophysiological role by altering the properties of mucous secretions and/or the interactions between selected bacteria and HMG at the airways' surface.\r"

  ".W": "The observation that type III erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are susceptible to hemolysis initiated by activated cobra venom factor complexes (CoFBb), whereas normal erythrocytes are resistant, implies that the PNH III cells are deficient in a membrane constituent that regulates this process. To isolate the inhibitory factor from normal erythrocytes, membrane proteins were first extracted with butanol and then subjected to sequential anion exchange, hydroxylapatite, and hydrophobic chromatography. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver stain of the inhibitory fractions showed a single band corresponding to a protein with an apparent Mr of 18 kD. PNH erythrocytes were incubated with incremental concentrations of the radiolabeled protein and then washed. In a dose-dependent fashion, the protein incorporated into the cell membrane and inhibited CoFBb-initiated lysis. This protein inhibitor functioned by restricting the assembly of the membrane attack complex at the level of C7 and C8 incorporation. By using a monospecific antibody to block the function of the inhibitor, it was shown that normal erythrocytes are rendered susceptible to CoFBb-initiated hemolysis. Analysis by Western blot of membrane proteins revealed that PNH III erythrocytes are deficient in the 18-kD protein. By virtue of its molecular weight and inhibitory activity, the 18-kD protein appears to be discrete from other previously described erythrocyte membrane proteins that regulate complement. These studies also indicate that the susceptibility of PNH III erythrocytes to reactive lysis is causally related to a deficiency of the 18-kD membrane inhibitor.\r"

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 84:861-865). Horseradish peroxidase (40,000 mol wt) was injected into guinea pigs and its uptake into megakaryocyte organelles examined by electron microscopy and cytochemistry. In the present study we tested the ability of guinea pig megakaryocytes to take up intravenously injected albumin, IgG, and fibrinogen. We used two types of proteins to study the endocytic pathway: (a) heterologous human proteins, which were detected immunohistochemically using antibodies that do not crossreact with the native guinea pig counterparts; and (b) human and guinea pig proteins labeled with the small (250 mol wt), inert molecule, biotin, which were detected using an antibody against biotin. We detected all three of the injected proteins in bone marrow megakaryocytes in patterns identical to those of native counterparts. The injected protein consistently appeared in platelets 24 h later and was secreted in response to thrombin. We conclude that there are at least two mechanisms by which guinea pig megakaryocyte granules acquire proteins (a) endogenous synthesis, as demonstrated by others, and (b) endocytosis of plasma proteins synthesized by other types of cells.\r"

In vivo microperfusion was performed in rat PCT with measurements of bicarbonate absorption and of tubular fluid cAMP delivery, as a reflection of intracellular cAMP. Intravenous angiotensin II potently increased S1 PCT bicarbonate absorption (348 +/- 11 to 588 +/- 8 peq/min.min, P less than 0.001) and decreased tubular fluid cAMP (18 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 fmol/mm.min, P less than 0.05). Parathyroid hormone had the expected opposite effects, which were additive to those of angiotensin II. Over a wide range of hormonal activities, there was an excellent inverse relationship between hormonally modulated bicarbonate absorption and cAMP delivery. Pertussis toxin pretreatment significantly attenuated (by 35-45%) the angiotensin-induced increase in bicarbonate absorption and decrease in cAMP delivery, indicating Gi-protein intermediation. Luminal dibutyryl cAMP abolished the transport response to angiotensin II. In conclusion, these in vivo results suggest angiotensin II stimulates bicarbonate absorption in the S1 PCT by a G1-mediated depression in intracellular cAMP.\r"

In addition to its presence in megakaryocytes and platelets, GMP-140 antigen was found in vascular endothelial cells of diverse human organs, but it was not detected in other types of secretory cells. [35S]Cysteine-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells synthesized a GMP-140 molecule containing complex N-linked oligosaccharides similar to those previously demonstrated in platelets and the megakaryocytic HEL cell line. Using an immunogold procedure on frozen thin sections of endothelial cells, we found GMP-140 antigen to be localized to membranes of electron-dense storage granules. In double-label experiments there was colocalization of GMP-140 with vWf, indicating that these granules are Weibel-Palade bodies. When endothelial cells were stimulated with histamine, GMP-140 rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane. Immunoassays of cell lysates indicated that, relative to total cell protein, less GMP-140 is present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells than in platelets. The restricted expression of GMP-140 in secretory granules of platelets and endothelium suggests that it has a specific function in the vascular system rather than a general role related to inducible secretion.\r"

(ii) T cell type: T/CLL, which was differentiated from reactive T/lymphocytosis; T/PLL; adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma; and Sezary's syndrome. The recognition of distinct entities within the B and T cell leukaemias seems to have clinical and epidemiological connotations. It is hoped that these proposals may serve as the basis for further work, discussion, and improved management of patients.\r"

These unculturable spiral organisms were probably an incidental finding in patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, but it is not possible to say from this small series whether these organisms cause chronic active gastritis. The organism is helical, 3.5-7.5 microns long and 0.9 micron in diameter with truncated ends flattened at the tips, and up to 12 sheathed flagella 28 nm in diameter at each pole. It is proposed that this spiral bacterium should be called \"Gastrospirillum hominis Gen.nov., Sp.nov.\"\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to develop technology for the detection of nucleic acid using two different DNA probe reporter molecules, the ultimate aim being to differentially label two nucleic acids within the same nucleus. Digoxigenin and biotin were used to label DNA probes. The absolute and relative sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled DNA probes for detecting integrated human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16) was investigated in CaSki cells by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH). Several methods for the detection of labelled probes were also investigated. The optimal sensitivity of digoxigenin labelled probe was equivalent to that of biotin when alkaline phosphatase was used as the final detector. The median number of discrete viral signals discernible in each cell with the most sensitive detection system was seven to eight with both labelled probes. The average number of HPV16 genomes in each CaSki cell, derived by dot blot hybridisation, was about 270. The calculated absolute sensitivity of NISH for viral detection in this system is complex because of variation of signal size and number. Nevertheless, one signal per nucleus equates to as little as 30 to 40 viral copies, and probably much less. The ability to distinguish up to 15 discrete signals with both digoxigenin and biotin labelled probes in the nuclei of CaSki cells indicates that these methods will be useful in interphase cytogenetics in material routinely fixed in aldehyde.\r"

This was achieved by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) with a biotinylated Y chromosome probe and digoxigenin labelled probe for human papilloma virus type 6 (HPV 6). The tissues studied were peripheral lymphocytes, tonsil, and penile warts. The hybridisation signals produced by biotinylated probes were visualised in red using streptavidin peroxidase and those produced by digoxigenin labelled probes as a blue/black colour using anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase. In lymphocytes and tonsil 95-100% of cells had a detectable Y chromosome; in warts only 60-70% of infected keratinocytes near the skin surface had a demonstrable Y chromosome. This suggests that this chromosome is lost or occluded in cell maturation. In simultaneous double hybridisation with both probes, HPV and Y sequences were demonstrable within the same nucleus in penile warts. This technique permits the simultaneous differential detection of two nuclei acid sequences in interphase nuclei and will have application in analysis of putative dual HPV infections and in determining the intranuclear spatial relations between nucleic acids in interphase nuclei.\r"

Measurements of ciliary deviation at the tip, base, and basal feet showed very little variation along the ciliary shaft in all three groups, suggesting that valid measurements of ciliary deviation can be made at any level of the cilium. Mean ciliary deviation in normal subjects was always less than 30 degrees; all patients with a mean ciliary deviation of greater than 30 degrees had recurrent respiratory tract disease. Four of seven patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia had ciliary disorientation; in one this was the only defect. Measurements of inter- and intraobserver variability using this method showed a maximum difference between observations of 4.1 degrees.

The glucuronidated and sulphated conjugates of acetaminophen were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and bicarbonate concentrations by gas analysis. In 21 subjects without colonic disease sulphate conjugation was observed in all cases, with a mean (SE) of 3.86 (0.66) nmol/hour, while glucuronide conjugation was found in seven of 21 cases. Mean (SE) bicarbonate output of 42.9 (3.9) mumol/hour (n = 21) indicated healthy colonic mucosal metabolism and phenolic sulphation in dialysate and agreed with published sulphation rates obtained with cultured cells of colonic epithelium. Acetaminophen sulphation suggests that the colonic mucosa has an important role in the conjugation of phenols, and the method reported here would be useful in assessing the detoxification capacity of the colonic mucosa in diseases of the rectal mucosa.\r"

Fifty selected sera were tested by all the methods (Toxo-M, Captia Toxo-M EIA, Toxo Enz M EIA, Toxonostika IgM EIA, Sopazyme Toxo IgM EIA) at the three reference centres in England and Wales and 177 routine sera by all the methods in one or other of the centres. Ten of the 50 selected sera contained autoimmune antibodies but no specific IgM and 29 had toxoplasma specific IgM detectable by the PHL IgM ELISA. The kits were assessed for their specificity and sensitivity compared with the PHL IgM ELISA, and the percentage coefficient of variation for binding to the solid phases was determined. They were also rated subjectively by the staff performing the assays and an overall impression of each kit was gained by allocating scores of several criteria. There was quite close agreement among the results obtained with all five commercial assays and the PHL IgM ELISA, although some of the sera pre-selected as being potentially problematic showed the limitations of some of the assays.\r"

Each athlete's best marathon time was less than 2 h 16 min. Echocardiography was performed at rest, at a 60 W work load and at an individually adjusted work load, at which heart rate was 110 beats/min (physical working capacity 110 [PWC110]). Oxygen uptake at PWC110 averaged (+/- SD) 1.14 +/- 0.2 liters/min in the nonathletes and 2.0 +/- 0.2 liters/min in the runners (p less than 0.001). The left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole was similar at the three activity levels in the control subjects but increased significantly from rest to exercise in the runners (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular systolic meridional wall stress remained unchanged during exercise in the nonathletes but was significantly higher at PWC110 in the athletes (p less than 0.05). Both the systolic peak velocity of posterior wall endocardial displacement and fractional shortening of the left ventricular internal diameter increased with exercise; at PWC110 the endocardial peak velocity was higher in the runners than in the control subjects (p less than 0.01). The endocardial peak velocity during relaxation was comparable in athletes and control subjects at rest, increased similarly at a 60 W work load, but was higher in the runners at PWC110 (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ultrafast computed tomography was used to characterize global and regional early diastolic filling in the left ventricle of 11 normal male volunteers. Regional early diastolic filling data from six distinct ventricular levels (apex to base) were fit to a third-order polynomial curve, and the peak rate of diastolic filling and time of peak filling were determined. Peak filling rate was 259 +/- 17 ml/s (+/- SEM) as a global average, where peak filling rate referenced to end-diastolic volume and stroke volume across the levels examined was 3.78 +/- 0.17 s-1 and 4.83 +/- 0.20 s-1, respectively. Average filling fraction was 39 +/- 1%, and time to peak filling from end-systole was 145 +/- 5 ms. Regional (tomographic) peak filling rates, except for the most apical level examined, were not statistically different across the ventricle. Filling fraction and time to peak filling were remarkably constant from one level to another. However, reference of regional peak filling rate to regional end-diastolic volume demonstrated significant nonuniformity from apex (120% of average for all levels) to base (87% of average for all levels). Peak filling rate referenced to tomographic stroke volume was less variable and not statistically different across the ventricle as a whole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation is a relatively load-independent measure of left ventricular contractile function. Linearity of the relation derived from full left ventricular pressure-volume loops has not previously been demonstrated for patients with severe heart failure. Therefore, nine patients with markedly depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 0.14 +/- 0.08) were studied with micromanometer left ventricular pressure measurement and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography. Afterload was reduced with graded infusions of nitroprusside, allowing construction of pressure-volume loops under four afterload conditions in four patients and three afterload conditions in the other five patients. The end-systolic pressure-volume relation derived from the pressure-volume loops was found to be linear for the range of pressures and volumes examined, with correlation coefficients in individual patients ranging from 0.936 to 0.999 (mean 0.981). The mean slope of the relation (or end-systolic elastance) was 0.71 mm Hg/ml (range 0.42 to 1.52), and the extrapolated volume intercept at zero pressure was positive in all patients. An exponential relation between end-systolic elastance and ejection fraction was demonstrated for this group of patients. Approximations of end-systolic elastance obtained from measurements other than the full pressure-volume loops correlated variably with \"true\" elastance obtained from the pressure-volume loops. The relation between stroke work and end-diastolic volume was nonlinear in most patients. Thus, the end-systolic pressure-volume relation is linear in the \"physiologic\" range in patients with severe heart failure. This finding should permit construction of the relation from two loading conditions in clinical studies, facilitating its use as an index of contractile function in patients with heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Peak left ventricular pressure during balloon inflation was measured in 20 patients who underwent balloon valvuloplasty for severe aortic stenosis to define the determinants of ventricular pressure development in response to increased loading conditions. The peak left ventricular pressure ranged from 150 +/- 5 to 386 +/- 22 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), was reproducible in each patient with each balloon inflation (mean coefficient of variation 7.8%) and correlated with concurrent echocardiographic measurements of ejection fraction (r = 0.89, p = 0.0001) and mass/volume ratio in systole (r = 0.91, p = 0.0001) or diastole (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001). Thirteen patients with class II or more severe congestive heart failure had lower values for peak left ventricular pressure than did those without failure (225 +/- 46 versus 305 +/- 45 mm Hg, p = 0.002), whereas no difference in rest left ventricular systolic pressure was seen between the two groups. The measurement of peak left ventricular pressure was inversely related to rest mean circumferential end-systolic wall stress (r = 0.52, p = 0.046). Thus, peak left ventricular systolic pressure measured during aortic valvuloplasty in humans correlates closely with traditional measures of left ventricular function. This measurement, which previously has been obtained only in experimental animal studies, is a simple and reproducible hemodynamic index that may provide new insights in studies of ventricular function and congestive heart failure in aortic stenosis.\r"

Extending these studies to acute myocardial infarction, the electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained from 32 patients within 5 h of the onset of chest pain was analyzed to determine if similar inferences could be made. A preinfarction ECG was available from each patient for comparison and 30 patients underwent coronary arteriography within 3 weeks of the infarction. The 10 patients with anterior infarction had a decrease (p less than 0.05) in the S wave in leads V2 (0.80 +/- 0.50 mV) and V3 (0.65 +/- 0.43 mV). In 23 patients with inferior infarction an increase (p less than 0.05) in the R wave of lead III (0.47 +/- 0.35 mV), S wave of lead aVL (0.31 +/- 0.23 mV) and R wave of lead aVF (0.37 +/- 0.30 mV) occurred. A strong positive correlation between the R wave changes in leads III and aVF and the S wave in lead aVL (r = 0.94 and 0.91, respectively) suggests that the R and S wave changes in these leads are expressions of the same phenomenon and indicates that the terminal QRS complex is chiefly affected. Eight of 23 patients with inferior infarction and ST depression in the anterior precordial leads had a normal left anterior descending coronary artery. All had an increase in S wave amplitude in leads V2 and V3. Eight patients had inferior infarction, ST depression in anterior leads and severe lesions in the left anterior descending artery or anterior wall motion abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty patients with coronary artery disease and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring underwent programmed electrical stimulation. In 22 patients, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced at baseline drug-free electrophysiologic testing; 9 of these patients subsequently developed a clinical sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In 18 patients, no tachycardia could be induced, and none of these 18 had subsequent tachycardia. In 25 of the 40 patients, arrhythmia management was guided by the results of electrophysiologic testing; this group included 11 patients who received antiarrhythmic therapy for induced ventricular tachycardia and 14 patients without inducible ventricular tachycardia who did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy. In the remaining 15 patients, arrhythmia management was not based on the results of electrophysiologic testing. Only two episodes of clinical sustained tachyarrhythmia occurred in the group receiving electrophysiologically guided therapy compared with seven episodes in the group treated without electrophysiologic guidance (p less than 0.01). Thus, in patients with coronary artery disease with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory electrocardiography, electrophysiologic testing can identify those at high and low risk for subsequent clinical tachycardia events. Furthermore, results of such testing can be used to optimize arrhythmia management in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen out-of-hospital survivors of ventricular fibrillation underwent a prospective, randomized, intraoperative comparison of sequential pulse and single pulse defibrillation with use of two distinct electrode systems and waveform shapes currently available for clinical use. Defibrillation was tested alternately with either the single pulse or the sequential pulse system 10 s into an episode of ventricular fibrillation. Sequential pulse defibrillation was performed with two 4 ms truncated exponential pulses of constant duration delivered to three equally spaced oval epicardial patch electrodes composed of concentric coils. The posterior left ventricular electrode served as the common cathode. The first anode was over the anterior right ventricle and the second anode was over the anterior left ventricle. Single pulse defibrillation was performed with the standard intracardiac defibrillation system with use of a single truncated exponential pulse with a fixed 65% tilt delivered across two rectangular, wire mesh epicardial patch electrodes positioned over the anterior right ventricle and posterolateral left ventricle. During defibrillation threshold determination, voltage and current waveforms were recorded and used to determine pulsing resistance and delivered and stored energy. Average defibrillation threshold leading edge voltage for the single pulse technique was 273 +/- 101 V compared with 246 +/- 67 V (11% less) for the sequential pulse technique (p = 0.136). Defibrillation threshold leading edge current for the single pulse technique was 6.7 +/- 2.5 A compared with 5.2 +/- 1.7 A (29% less) for the sequential pulse method (p = 0.005). The defibrillation threshold delivered energy was 5.6 +/- 4.0 J for the single pulse technique and 3.5 +/- 1.8 J (38% less) for the sequential pulse technique (p = 0.021).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Balloon dilation was performed twice in one of these patients. The Doppler and symptomatic improvement were sustained in both patients at short-term follow-up (5 and 6 months, respectively).

Arrhythmogenic effects occurred in 6.9% of patients and 3.4% of drug trials. This ranged from a high of 11.8% caused by encainide to none occurring with procainamide, tocainide or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The incidence of arrhythmogenesis was significantly greater in patients whose presenting arrhythmia was sustained ventricular tachycardia than it was in those who presented with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (p = 0.02). Decreased systolic function measured echocardiographically at the base of the left ventricle was associated with an increased incidence of arrhythmogenic effects (p = 0.006) whereas global left ventricular ejection fraction was not. Age, gender, cardiac diagnosis, location of prior myocardial infarction and New York Heart Association functional class for heart failure were not related to the occurrence of drug-induced arrhythmias. These findings emphasize the need for in-hospital cardiac monitoring during initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

Sixty-one adult mongrel dogs were classified into eight groups according to premedication: 1) control group, physiologic saline solution was administered intravenously 25 min before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation; 2) aprindine group, 3 mg/kg body weight of aprindine intravenously; 3) disopyramide group, 2 mg/kg of disopyramide intravenously; 4) flecainide group, 2 mg/kg of flecainide intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 micrograms/kg per min; 5) lidocaine group, 2 mg/kg of lidocaine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 micrograms/kg per min; 6) mexiletine group, 3 mg/kg per min of mexiletine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 15 micrograms/kg per min; 7) pentisomide group, 5 mg/kg intravenously; and 8) propafenone group, 2 mg/kg intravenously. Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the experiment. Two hours after coronary occlusion, the heart was excised. Myocardial mitochondria were prepared and mitochondrial function (the respiratory control index and the rate of oxygen consumption in state III) was measured polarographically. Fractionation of myocardial tissues was performed and the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and beta-glucuronidase) activities among fractions were measured. No significant hemodynamic changes were observed compared with the control group except for those in the disopyramide and flecainide groups; that is, decrease in heart rate without changes in blood pressure compared with the control group was observed. All antiarrhythmic drugs effectively prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac denervation has been proved to reduce the incidence of coronary occlusion arrhythmias in digs, but the effect of limiting the extent of sympathectomy to the ischemic area, particularly in hearts with sparse coronary collateral circulation, as in the human heart, needs further investigation. Ventricular arrhythmias and changes in epicardial direct current electrograms induced during acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion were recorded in 14 pigs subjected to regional denervation of the ischemic area 2 weeks before; these were compared with findings in 14 sham-operated control pigs. Regional denervation was induced by pericoronary application of phenol above the occlusion site and it was confirmed by the loss of myocardial catecholamine histofluorescence. During 35 min of ischemia, significant differences in occurrence of ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachycardia, ST segment elevation, TQ segment depression and epicardial activation delays were observed between the two groups of experiments, with lower values of each variable in the denervated hearts. Ventricular fibrillation occurred 32 times in 11 control pigs and only 15 times in eight denervated hearts. In contrast, programmed ventricular extrastimuli delivered during 35 to 50 min of ischemia induced 39 fibrillatory episodes in 13 denervated hearts and only 14 episodes in seven control pigs. Thus, denervation limited to the ischemic area in hearts with a human-like coronary artery pattern was associated with a decrease in the magnitude of early ischemic arrhythmias and electrocardiographic alterations, but the procedure was unable to prevent early induction of ventricular fibrillation.\r"

Seven dogs weighing 20.2 +/- 0.5 kg were utilized. Monophasic pulses of 10 ms duration were compared with three biphasic pulses. All biphasic waveforms had an initial positive phase (P1) followed by a terminal negative phase (P2) and the total duration of P1 plus P2 was 10 ms. The dual capacitor biphasic waveform (P1 9 ms, P2 1 ms) had equal initial voltages of P1 and P2. Two simulated single capacitor biphasic waveforms were also tested, the first designed to minimize the magnitude of P2 (P1 9 ms, P2 1 ms with initial voltage of P2 equal to 0.3 of the initial voltage of P1) and the second to maximize P2 (P1 5 ms, P2 5 ms with initial voltage of P2 = 0.5 P1). Alternating current was used to induce ventricular fibrillation and four trials of eight initial voltages from 100 to 800 V were performed for each of the four waveforms. Stepwise logistic regression was utilized to construct curves relating probability of successful defibrillation and energy. In the logistic model, the dual capacitor biphasic and single capacitor biphasic waveforms that maximized P2 were associated with significantly (p less than 0.001) lower energy requirements for defibrillation than those of the monophasic waveform. The single capacitor biphasic waveform that minimized P2 was not significantly better than the monophasic waveform.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine (cyclocreatine), a synthetic creatine analog, to protect myocardium during global ischemia was assessed in isovolumic rat hearts using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Wistar rats were fed a 1% cyclocreatine diet. After 2 weeks, cyclocreatine-fed (n = 8) and control (n = 7) rats were anesthetized, the heart was excised and retrograde perfusion was begun at 10 ml/min per g with 37 degrees C, phosphate-free buffer containing glucose and oxygen. Hemodynamic and spectroscopic data were obtained during baseline, ischemia and recovery periods (each 24 min). During ischemia, the heart of control rats developed a rigor-like increase in tonic pressure (ischemic contracture) not seen in the heart of cyclocreatine-fed rats (22 versus 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). This change was associated with significantly more adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at end-ischemia in the cyclocreatine group (1.6 versus 0.6 mumol/g, p less than 0.01) and delayed development of acidosis (p less than 0.001). With reperfusion, the heart of cyclocreatine-fed rats spontaneously defibrillated sooner than did the heart in control rats (178 versus 346 s, p less than 0.03). Diastolic pressure remained significantly elevated throughout recovery in control hearts compared with treated hearts (p less than 0.001). Prior feeding with cyclocreatine preserves myocardial adenosine triphosphate during ischemia, delays the development of acidosis and ischemic contracture and improves recovery of mechanical function on reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Right ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential recordings were obtained in a patient with a qunidine-induced long QTU interval and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of the torsade de pointes type. The recording showed a deflection on phase 3 repolarization characteristic of early afterdepolarization. The early afterdepolarization was synchronous with the U wave in surface electrocardiographic leads and there was a strong correlation between the amplitude of both waves. A strong correlation was also present between the cardiac cycle length and the U wave amplitude with larger amplitudes after longer cycles. Ventricular ectopic beats occurred only after long cycle lengths and seemed to arise close to the peak of the U wave and early afterdepolarization. However, there was no correlation between the amplitude of the U wave or early afterdepolarization and the occurrence of ectopic beats. Rapid ventricular pacing resulted in suppression of the ectopic rhythm associated with suppression of both the U wave and the early afterdepolarization. This case provides the first evidence to suggest that a quinidine-induced long QTU interval and torsade de pointes may be related to bradycardia-dependent early afterdepolarizations, although other factors may be involved in triggering the arrhythmia.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence, outcome and predictors of the in-hospital development of cardiogenic shock and its prognostic significance were analyzed in 845 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock developed after hospitalization in 60 patients (7.1%). In half of these patients, cardiogenic shock developed at least 24 h after hospital admission. The in-hospital mortality rate was greater than 15 times higher for patients with cardiogenic shock than for patients without shock (65.0% versus 4.3%, respectively, p less than 0.001). Enzymatic evidence of infarct extension occurred in 23.3% of the patients with shock compared with 7.4% of those without shock (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that independent predictors for the in-hospital development of cardiogenic shock were age greater than 65 years (p = 0.007), left ventricular ejection fraction on hospital admission less than 35% (p = 0.007), large infarct as estimated from serial enzyme determinations (that is, peak creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme greater than 160 IU/liter (p = 0.008), history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.011) and previous myocardial infarction (p = 0.012). Patients with three, four or five of these risk factors had a 17.9%, 33.7% or 54.4% probability, respectively, of developing cardiogenic shock after hospital admission. Left ventricular function, as reflected by left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.04) and severity of left ventricular wall motion abnormality (p = 0.04), was the most important determinant of in-hospital mortality in the patients with cardiogenic shock.\r"

  ".W": "To define the outcome of patients given medical or surgical therapy for Q wave myocardial infarction, 387 patients were followed up for 10 to 13 years (mean 11.4). On study entry the groups had similar distributions for variables such as mean age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, abnormal creatine kinase activity, area of infarction, number of vessels diseased and clinical classification. The hospital mortality rate of the medical versus surgical group was 11.5% (23 of 200) versus 5.8% (11 of 187) (p = 0.07). Early reperfusion (that is, less than or equal to 6 h) resulted in a lower mortality rate than did medical therapy--2% (2 of 100) versus 11.5% (23 of 200) (p less than 0.05)--whereas the hospital mortality rate with late reperfusion was 10.3% (9 of 87). The long-term mortality rate of the medical and surgical groups was 41% (82 of 200) versus 27% (51 of 187) (p = 0.0007) with use of an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. In the survivors, the differences between medical and surgical groups in recurrent myocardial infarction, mortality associated with reinfarction and sudden death were prospectively followed and evaluated by the life table method. Recurrent myocardial infarction was not prevented by surgical reperfusion or medical therapy (23% in both groups), however, the mortality rate in patients with recurrent infarction was higher in the medical therapy group--36.6% (15 of 41) versus 17.5% (7 of 40) (p = 0.04). The mortality difference did not depend on early or late surgical reperfusion. In the in-hospital survivors, the incidence of sudden death was 17.5% in the medical (31 of 177) versus 7.4% (13 of 176) in the surgical group (p = 0.01). This difference was much more pronounced in the early reperfusion group. Functional class was significantly lower than that for medical therapy in the early reperfusion but not the late reperfusion group. Thus, in comparable groups given medical and surgical therapy for acute myocardial infarction and followed up for greater than or equal to 10 years, surgical reperfusion appears to offer improved longevity in selected cases (when implemented early) but does not prevent recurrent myocardial infarction. The associated mortality with recurrent myocardial infarction is less as is the incidence of sudden death. Finally, lower functional class occurs most often in patients given early reperfusion.\r"

In the anterior infarction group, 102 received conventional therapy and 101 underwent surgical reperfusion. The overall hospital mortality rate in the medically and surgically treated patients was different (16.7% [17 of 102] versus 6.9% [7 of 101], p less than 0.05). The cumulative 13 year actuarial mortality rate widened between the anterior medical and surgical groups (54% versus 31%, p = 0.0003) by the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. The hospital mortality rate with early reperfusion (that is, less than or equal to 6 h of symptom onset) was 2% (1 of 51), whereas the mortality rate with late reperfusion was 12% (6 of 50). The 13 year actuarial cumulative mortality rate was significantly lower in both the early and late reperfusion groups (30% and 33%, respectively) than in the conventional therapy group (54%, p = 0.0006). The mortality rate in patients receiving surgery after surviving initial medical therapy was 50% (15 of 30). In the survivors of anterior Q wave myocardial infarction, improved global ejection fraction was seen in the patients undergoing early (54 +/- 13%) and late (50 +/- 10%) surgery relative to those receiving conventional therapy (43 +/- 11%, p less than 0.05). Only the early reperfusion group had better regional function of the anterior wall than that of the conventional therapy group. Thus, ventricular function correlated with improved long-term survival. In the patients with inferior Q wave myocardial infarction, the overall hospital mortality rate in the medical and surgical groups was not different (6.1% [6 of 98] versus 4.6% [6 of 86], p = NS). Likewise, the 13 year actuarial cumulative mortality rate was not different between the medical and surgical groups overall (32% versus 30%, p = 0.29) by the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. The hospital mortality rate in the early reperfusion group was lower than that in the late reperfusion group (2.0% [1 of 49] versus 8.1% [3 of 37], p = NS). The 13 year actuarial cumulative mortality rate was lower in the early surgical group compared with that in the medical group (19% versus 32%, p = 0.04). The late surgical group had a similar 13 year actuarial cumulative mortality rate to that of the medical group (47% versus 32%, respectively, p = 0.47).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

No patient had a history of congestive heart failure and the cardiothoracic ratio measured less than or equal to 0.5 in all patients. All 12 patients were symptomatic during ventricular tachycardia; syncope occurred in 4. Exercise-related symptoms were present in 8 (73%) of 11 patients. The mean right ventricular ejection fraction was 31% (range 20% to 54%), and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 68% (range 44% to 88%). Signal averaging of the rest electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed late potentials in five of eight patients. During programmed electrical stimulation, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia showing a left bundle branch block configuration was induced in all patients. One patient underwent right ventricular disconnection and died 1 week after operation of low cardiac output failure. The remaining 11 patients were all treated medically and are alive at a mean follow-up time of 7.9 years after the onset of symptoms. Recurrence of symptomatic and documented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred in eight patients and could not be predicted by results of long-term ECG monitoring, treadmill exercise testing or programmed stimulation. In conclusion, despite recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia have a favorable outcome when treated medically. Noninvasive studies (imaging techniques, ambulatory ECG monitoring and exercise testing) provide data that may be sufficient in diagnosing arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) serum 25-OHD levels were significantly lower (P less than .01) in the elderly patients (13.5 +/- 8.9 ng/mL) than in healthy young controls (24.7 +/- 6.1 ng/mL). One hundred ten patients (35.5%) were either vitamin D deficient (25-OHD less than 5 ng/mL) or had borderline serum levels of 25-OHD (5-9 ng/mL). The mean (+/- SD) serum 25-OHD concentration of patients who were completely mobile before hospitalization was 15.5 +/- 8.8 ng/mL (n = 239). In patients mainly immobilized but able to leave the house occasionally, it was 10.2 +/- 6.3 ng/mL (n = 84) and of bed-ridden patients, it was 5.2 +/- 3.2 ng/mL (n = 15). No correlation was found between serum 25-OHD levels and the patients' age or serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin values. Thus, in order to detect vitamin D deficiency in the elderly, it is necessary to measure serum 25-OHD concentration. The results demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency is common among elderly patients even in sunny climates and indicate the need for development of effective programs of prevention and treatment.\r"

The sample consisted of 40 spouses who were caring for the Alzheimer patient at home, 20 who participated in the educational program, and 20 controls. The instrument used for the study was the Health Specific Family Coping Index (HSFCI). This instrument provided a quantitative assessment of overall family coping with both potential and actual health problems in the psychosocial and physical domains of health. It is rated in nine domains: physical independence, therapeutic competence, knowledge of the condition, application of principles of personal hygiene, attitude toward health care, emotional competence, family living patterns, physical environment, and use of community resources. A home visit was made by a registered nurse prior to the educational intervention and at the end of the four-week intervention period. The HSFCI was completed at each visit. There were no pretreatment differences between the intervention and control groups in coping ability. Findings indicate that the educational program was beneficial in assisting spouses to feel greater competence in the face of the disease process and to function with greater independence. In the treatment group, the greatest significant increase was in the knowledge domain, followed by therapeutic competence and emotional competence. There was no overall relationship between gender of the spouse and coping ability.\r"

Survival and health care utilization were examined during a mean follow-up period of five months. Cases and controls were matched by age, functional status, severity and type of medical illness, and extent of disease. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among depressed compared with nondepressed controls (6 vs 0 deaths, P = .03). For patients discharged from the hospital alive, however, depression did not have a substantial impact on mortality (31.4% cases, 31.7% controls). Health care utilization--in terms of days of inpatient care--was significantly higher both during the index admission (25 vs 14 days, P less than .005) and during the follow-up period (16 vs 7 days, P less than .05) for depressed patients compared with controls. Hence, older medically ill patients with major depression consume more healthcare resources and experience greater mortality during their initial hospital stay. After discharge, while survival is little affected, excess resource utilization persists among those with depression.\r"

In this study, the reliability of an anthropometric measurement protocol, designed for ease in measurement of both independent and functionally debilitated elderly patients, is evaluated. An analysis of variance technique was used to calculate the test-retest variance for each of three observers. Although the experience of the three observers was equivalent, the precision of their measurements varied considerably. After repeat practice sessions, improved measurement reliability was demonstrated. For all the observers, the test-retest variance was found to be proportional to the size of the measurement and to be influenced by the accuracy in which the site for each measurement was located. Based on this study, we conclude that when using anthropometrics it is important to know the reliability of each observers' measurements. Because of the correlation between the test-retest variance and the measurement value, we suggest that the variance be expressed as a percentile. A method for transforming the variances is presented.\r"

Only one myocardial infarction was diagnosed, an incidence rate of 0.4%. The overall rate of serious post-operative complications was 3.6%. No deaths occurred during the operative hospitalization. We conclude that with transurethral resection perioperative myocardial infarction is a rare event despite the high prevalence of coronary artery disease in this surgical population. Routine postoperative surveillance with electrocardiograms and creatine kinase determinations in asymptomatic patients is not warranted.\r"

Within a week each patient received a home interview and details were collected on drug compliance and use of drugs other than those reported by the general practitioners. On average, each patient was taking 3.6 drugs, of which 2.9 were correctly reported by the general practitioners and 0.7 were unreported. Among the most prescribed therapeutic groups there were drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (cardiovascular drugs, diuretics, psychotropic agents) and substances whose efficacy has never been fully documented (\"cerebroactive-vasoactive\" agents). Age and number of complaints were positively and significantly correlated with number of prescribed drugs. Nearly half of the sample (44.4%)--more frequently women and people with higher education--were taking one or more drugs not detected by the general practitioners, often benzodiazepines taken over a long period for anxiety or insomnia. Full compliance occurred for 81.5% of the prescriptions and 59.9% of patients were correctly taking all prescribed drugs. Compliance was lower for prescriptions of the general practitioners compared with other doctors' prescriptions (eg, hospital doctor, private doctor) and probability of taking correctly all the prescribed drugs decreased with the number of medicines concurrently taken. The most common reason for noncompliance was fear of side effects.\r"

Regression analysis indicated that injury severity, as measured by the admitting Glasgow Coma Scale, was a good predictor of hospital cost, while patient age was unrelated to cost. The regression relationship, however, was quadratic (not linear), indicating that least injured and severely injured patients cost less than moderately injured patients. These findings are in direct contrast with the commonly held belief that the elderly consume more hospital resources than younger patients. They suggest the need for a reexamination of the use of age in setting prospective reimbursement amounts in certain diagnoses, and in making resource allocation decisions relative to geriatric programming at the hospital level. Head trauma patients are costly because they are sick, not because they are old.\r"

In addition, the onsets of activity of functionally important muscles were less tightly bilaterally coupled, and patterns of muscle onsets were less stereotypically organized in older adults.

The peroxide-induced autofluorescence (PIAF) in H2O2 treated liver smears is due to the oxidation of flavins bound uniformly to all proteins of the cell membrane, i.e., an average lateral diffusion constant (D) of those proteins can be measured. D showed a negative linear age-correlation in both sexes: D male = (2.81 - 0.016X)10(-10), and D female = (2.67 - 0.020X)10(-10) cm2/sec, (r greater than 0.94), where X is the age in months. Sex differences are significant (p less than .001) in the intercept. Fractional recovery did not prove to be age-dependent; it was, on average, 91% in males and 100% in females. The findings agree well with the previously obtained data on Fischer 344 and Wistar rats, and strengthen the gerontological relevance of D.\r"

We propose that four conditions must be satisfied in order for a fall to cause a hip fracture: (a) the faller must be oriented to impact near the hip; (b) protective responses must fail; (c) local soft tissues must absorb less energy than necessary to prevent fracture, and (d) the residual energy of the fall applied to the proximal femur must exceed its strength. All of these events become more likely with aging and lead to an exponential rise in the risk of hip fracture with advancing age. This model also suggests that a combination of measurements of neuromuscular function and of bone strength may be the most accurate approach to assessing the risk of hip fracture.\r"

In men, decreased levels of physical activity, stroke, arthritis of the knees, impairment of gait, and increased body sway were associated with an increased risk of falls. In women, the total number of drugs, psychotropic drugs and drugs liable to cause postural hypotension, standing systolic blood pressure of less than 110 mmHg, and evidence of muscle weakness were also associated with an increased risk of falling. Most falls in elderly people are associated with multiple risk factors, many of which are potentially remediable. The possible implications of this in diagnosis and prevention are discussed.\r"

Men and women were not different except for the higher value in women at age 20 to 29. Serum prolactin did not fall after the menopause, while estrogen treatment had no effect on older women and caused only a slight rise in older men. Thyroid deficiency had only a minimal effect and did not raise the serum prolactin above 25 ng/ml. The prevalence of clearly elevated values (greater than 20 ng/ml) was only 1.3% in women and 0.6% in men above age 50; there is little evidence for a significant prevalence of prolactin-secreting adenomata in older persons.

When rats were sacrificed 1 hour after camostate administration (100 mg/kg), plasma CCK concentration significantly increased in both age groups and was significantly higher in young rats than in the old. Acute pancreatic responses to camostate were attenuated in old rats, compared with the young. On the other hand, 5-day administration of camostate (100 mg/kg, twice a day) increased pancreatic wet weight, chymotrypsin concentration and content in pancreas in both age groups, whereas lipase content did not increase in old rats although it significantly increased in young rats. Plasma CCK concentrations were not significantly different between young and old rats. It is concluded that the acute response of CCK release to camostate is attenuated in old rats, but the capability of chronic pancreatic adaptation of chymotrypsin content to camostate is well maintained in old rats.\r"

At the time of data collection, 72% were over 50 years of age. Three LOC components were measured in a mailed questionnaire: sense of personal control or lack of control over the direction of one's own life (Life Direction), beliefs about how responsible people are for misfortunes in their lives (Responsibility), and beliefs concerning the role of luck in determining people's outcomes (Luck). Model-fitting results indicated that genetic influences were of importance for Life Direction and Responsibility, accounting for somewhat over 30% of the variance in each component, while environmental influences explained twin similarity for Luck.\r"

Psychological tests of cognition or descriptions by relatives or other caregivers are often used to make judgments as to the patient's ability to adapt to the demands of the environment. However, these methods have built-in biases. The need for direct assessment of functional status was addressed by developing a standardized operational procedure to examine areas of functional competence which may become impaired in Alzheimer's disease and other related memory disorders. The resulting instrument has high interrater and test-retest reliabilities. Convergent validity is evidenced by significant correlations between the scale and established measures of functional status. Patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibited deficits in functional capacities relative to age-equivalent normal controls and to elderly patients with a primary major depression.\r"

Their investigation uncovered numerous significant relationships between test taker age and scores on various scales of the MMPI. The present study looked at the MMPI profiles of 214 healthy men and women between the ages of 39 and 89. The results gleaned from this investigation do not reflect the same intensity of age-related changes that are reported by Colligan et al. (1983) and other similar studies. More specifically, we were unable to detect the age-related elevations in the \"neurotic triad\" (Hs, D, Hy scales) that have often been cited by other researchers. Additionally, we were not able to support the typically reported aging effects in scales Mf, Pa, Pt, and Si. We suggest that these and other similar differences may be attributed to geographic, societal, and population factors.\r"

Older Americans participate in many unpaid productive activities at levels that are comparable to those reached by middle-aged and younger Americans; these activities include volunteer work in organizations, informal help to others, maintenance and repair of their home and possessions, and housework. Relatively few older Americans spend any time participating in paid work and unpaid rearing of children. Largely because of the cessation of paid work and child care, older Americans spend less time overall in productive activities. Women and men spend about equal time in productive activities, but women spend more of it in unpaid work and less of it in paid work. The difficulties with using paid work as the major indicator for describing productivity across the life span are discussed.\r"

These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident.\r"

Neither measure was associated with mortality in univariate or multiple logistic regression analyses. The adjusted relative risk of mortality comparing the lowest to highest levels of a three-level depression variable was 0.9 (95% confidence interval = 0.5-1.4). Similar results were obtained with other versions of the depression variables, with each depressive symptom category, and within sex, chronic disease, widowhood status, and age groups. These results indicate that depression does not increase mortality in elderly adults, but the short follow-up, sample characteristics, and operationalization of depression may have affected this association.\r"

I propose a new classification which I believe is consistent and well founded, based on the presence of histologic gastritis and acid secretion of the stomach. Four categories are presented: (a) normal histology, (b) \"active\" gastritis, (c) \"inactive\" gastritis, and (d) atrophic gastritis with achlorhydria. Acid secretion is present in categories a-c. The classification is dependent on the presence of the \"poly\" to denote active gastritis, round cells to classify inactive gastritis, and the loss of parietal and chief cells with achlorhydria to define gastric atrophy. I propose that polys and acid, which characterize active gastritis, are necessary for producing dyspepsia and/or gastroduodenal mucosal injury, and provide a rationale for treatment. The accepted causes of active gastritis include acid-peptic disease, Campylobacter pylori, and aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) medication.\r"

Achalasia was the initial diagnosis in only 12 patients. The others were given diagnoses of gastroesophageal reflux (4), presbyesophagus (2), esophageal spasm (2), psychiatric disorders (2), and combination of various disorders (3). In the latter patients, various diagnostic studies were either inappropriately delayed or misinterpreted, so that incorrect diagnoses were given. Errors in diagnosis led to further inappropriate testing and therapies. We conclude that: (a) achalasia remains an elusive diagnosis in current practice, (b) errors in diagnosis are related to delay in obtaining appropriate studies or misinterpretation of such studies, and (c) this delay leads to persistent symptoms and ineffective and/or inappropriate therapies.\r"

This study examined the effectiveness of intraosseous infusion for delivery of substances to the central circulation. Central deliveries of a radionuclide tracer administered by the intraosseous and intravenous routes were evaluated during normovolemic and hypovolemic states. Intraosseous infusion achieved peripheral to central circulation transit times comparable to those achieved by the intravenous route. Analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences between the peripheral to central delivery times comparing intraosseous and intravenous administration. The results demonstrate that intraosseous infusion is a rapid and effective method of delivery to the central circulation and is an alternative method for intravascular access. This study also suggests that a radionuclide tracer is useful for the evaluation of transit times following intraosseous injection.\r"

  ".U": "89292582\r", 
  ".W": "Mass casualty is a sporadic event precipitated by natural or man made causes which can be defined as the need for medical care exceeding the ability to provide it. Many literature reports of mass casualty evolutions depict scenes of chaos and confusion, leading to a need for a standardized approach to assessment, triage, and initial resuscitation. Even with the advent of trained emergency medicine specialists to direct these activities, such a framework would seem highly desirable for other participating primary care specialists. Additionally, a uniform system might be particularly useful in the mass casualty situation where international rescue teams converge on one disaster site. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) is a standardized approach easily adaptable to triage and resuscitation of multiple patients. Its use and effectiveness in mass casualty, however, has not had prior mention in the literature. This paper presents the first reported adaptation of ATLS principles to mass casualty during the invasion of Grenada. The bulk of 76 patients brought to the Primary Casualty Receiving and Treatment Center (PCRTC) were triaged, stabilized, and resuscitated by three PGY-1 trained, non-trauma-experienced physicians. During the primary survey, 8 major life threatening problems were identified and immediately corrected without loss of life. The ATLS system seemed to provide a comfortable framework for these partially trained physicians. Arguments for its adaptation and use as an international system approach are discussed.\r"

Bile duct destruction in this model is similar to that which occurs in human CGVHD, late liver transplant rejection, and primary biliary cirrhosis. This model provides a unique opportunity to isolate mononuclear inflammatory cells from the liver during CGVHD, study their functions, and investigate the immunologic mechanisms responsible for bile duct destruction. In the present study, we compared the in vivo organ homing of mononuclear inflammatory cells (MC) isolated from the liver and spleen during the course of CGVHD. MC isolated from the liver showed a progressive increase in homing to the livers of BALB/c mice from day 7 through 42. In contrast, the hepatic homing of MC isolated from the spleen peaked at day 21 and subsequently declined. CGVHD spleen MC showed a progressive increase in homing to the spleen of BALB/c mice whereas CGVHD liver MC showed no change over time. Homing to other organs was negligible. The hepatic and splenic homing of MC isolated during CGVHD was significantly greater in BALB/c (host) mice than in B10.D2 (donor) mice. Autoradiography was used to determine the intrahepatic sites at which CGVHD liver MC accumulate after i.v. injection into BALB/c mice. The results indicated that MC isolated from the liver when bile duct inflammation is most intense accumulate preferentially in hepatic portal spaces in close proximity to interlobular bile ducts. These results suggest that hepatic homing by CGVHD liver MC is specific for minor histocompatibility Ag expressed on host biliary epithelial cells. These data support the hypothesis that bile duct destruction in murine CGVHD is mediated by MC that are sensitized to minor histocompatibility Ag expressed by host biliary epithelial cells.\r"

Immunized mice were used to obtain three hybridomas producing mAb able to recognize both the immunizing peptide and human IFN-alpha, as determined by RIA and immunoprecipitation.

Although three IgG3 mAb failed to develop cryoglobulins, they were able to bind nonspecifically to any IgG3 molecules as efficiently as cryoprecipitable IgG did. The direct role of the gamma 3 constant region for the generation of cryoglobulins was demonstrated by the following findings: 1) the cryoglobulin activity was independent of the specificity of the IgG3 mAb, 2) no mAb other than those of the IgG3 subclass, including IgM rheumatoid factors (RF), generated cryoglobulins, and 3) the cryoglobulin activity was gained after the Ig class switch of mAb from IgM to IgG3. Analysis of Ig components in three different sources of cryoglobulins, either induced by the injection of bacterial LPS or by the infection with Plasmodium yoelii in BALB/c mice or developed spontaneously in MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice, revealed the selective concentration of IgG3 in these cryoglobulins; greater than 99%, 73% and 58% of IgG recoverable from these three cryoglobulins, respectively, were IgG3. This further attests to the major role of IgG3 in the generation of cryoglobulins in mice. In addition, the enhanced formation and even induction of IgG3 cryoglobulins in the presence of IgM anti-IgG3 RF mAb, and the enrichment of IgM RF in LPS- or malaria-induced cryoglobulins indicated that IgM RF can be involved in the generation of cryoglobulins by interacting with noncryoprecipitable IgG3 as well as cryoprecipitable IgG3.\r"

To study the expression of the IDDM associated HLA-DQ beta-chain alleles, we immunized rabbits with 12 to 13 amino acid long peptides representing HLA-DQw7 and -DQw8 allelic sequences, differing only by one amino acid in position 57 being aspartic acid (Asp) and alanine (Ala), respectively. Immunoblot analysis of lymphoblastoid cells showed that several antisera recognized a 29-kDa protein, equivalent to the expected molecular size of the HLA-DQ beta-chain to yield two antisera specific for HLA-DQw7 (pos. 57Asp) and three antisera for HLA-DQw8 (pos. 57Ala) positive cells. Analysis of HLA-DR 3/4 positive IDDM patients (n = 24) and controls (n = 19) showed that all (100%) patients were positive for pos. 57Ala antiserum compared to 13 of 19 (68%) of the controls. The remaining six controls reacted with the pos. 57Asp antisera, whereas none of the patients did. We have therefore successfully been able to generate site-specific antibodies that distinguish single amino acid substitutions in predetermined positions of allelic HLA-DQ beta-chain gene products. Such sera should become useful to detect and investigate HLA associated susceptibility to autoimmune diseases in man.\r"

In this investigation C5b-9 was localized in the passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) by immunoelectron microscopy with a mAb specific for C5b-9(m) neoantigen. Its distribution was compared with that in another model of MN induced by successive injections of cationic human IgG and rabbit anti-human IgG into rats. In PHN C5b-9 was found: 1) in the immune deposits (ID), and on the cell membranes of foot processes close to the ID; 2) in clathrin-coated pits of the glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) close to the ID and in membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm, separated from sheep IgG and the gp330 Ag; 3) in high concentration in multivesicular bodies of GEC; and 4) in association with membrane vesicles in the urinary space which presumably are the exocytosed content of membrane vesicular bodies. By contrast, in the cationic IgG-MN model C5b-9 was found mostly in ID, but rarely within the GEC. By freeze-fracture electron microscopy we have further identified 200- to 250-A intramembrane particles in PHN in the cell membranes of the \"soles\" of the foot processes which resemble membrane inserted human C5b-9(m). Degradation products of C5b-9 were further detected by immunoblotting of a 100,000 x g pellet of PHN rat urine. These results indicate that, in PHN, C5b-9 is inserted into the cell membranes of GEC, and that it is selectively endocytosed and transported across GEC by a cellular mechanism which apparently protects the cell from accumulation of membrane-inserted C5b-9.\r"

Human C9 contains a tetrameric and a pentameric sequence (amino acids 293-296 and 528-532, respectively) that together match a continuous segment in the melittin sequence, i.e., residues 8-16. It has been suggested that the tetrameric and the pentameric regions on C9 form a discontinuous epitope on folded C9 that mimics the structure of melittin. To further test this hypothesis, antibodies to C9-sequence-specific peptides were prepared. Peptides containing either the homologous tetrameric or the homologous pentameric sequence together with short stretches of the respective amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking regions were synthesized, as well as a composite peptide predicted to resemble the discontinuous epitope as a linear, nine-amino acid sequence. Direct and competitive binding assays demonstrated that the tetrameric and the pentameric sequences are part of the epitope on human C9 that is recognized by anti-melittin IgG. However, only antibodies directed against the complete epitope are capable of inhibiting hemolysis. Because neither anti-tetramer nor anti-pentamer antibodies affect hemolysis whereas anti-melittin and anti-composite antibodies do, we propose that human C9 changes conformation around a hinge located between residues 296 and 528 and that the latter two antibodies inhibit unfolding required for membrane insertion and subsequent hemolysis.\r"

The level of binding to rabbit F(acb)2 and rabbit F(ab')2 fragments was similar. Protein G binding to solid phase Fc fragments was inhibited by IgG, Fc, staphylococcal protein A and its monovalent fragment D, but was enhanced by F(ab')2 fragments. Chemical modification of tyrosine but not histidine residues of IgG abrogated its ability to inhibit the binding of protein G to solid phase Fc fragments. Protein G was found to strongly inhibit the binding of a monoclonal and a polyclonal human rheumatoid factor to IgG. These findings indicate that protein G binds with separate sites to the Fc and F(ab')2 fragments of IgG, that the interaction with the Fc fragment occurs at the C gamma 2-C gamma 3 domain interface region and that tyrosine but not histidine residues in this area are likely involved. The relationship of the Fc fragment-binding site specificity of protein G to that of other microbial IgG binding proteins and human rheumatoid factors is discussed.\r"

Both clones were positive for the determinant expressed on the epsilon chain of CD3 that is recognized by the mAb, 145-2C11 (2C11 mAb); one clone also expressed the V beta 8 epitope of the alpha/beta chains of the TCR recognized by the F23.1 mAb. Treatment of these cells with 2C11 or F23.1 mAb adsorbed onto polystyrene beads induced a time-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-pulsed accessory cells which expressed the appropriate MHC phenotype also induced IP accumulation, whereas no response was induced by medium-treated or MHC congenic accessory cells. The hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids induced by TCR perturbation depended upon the presence of exogenous Ca2+; Mg2+ did not substitute for Ca2+. Treatment of cells with ionomycin at concentrations up to 30 microM was unable to induce hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, indicating that entrance of Ca2+ was itself insufficient to generate IP. Stimulated IP generation was rapidly blocked upon addition of EGTA to the incubation medium. Reducing the level of exogenous Ca2+ decreased the production of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphate isomers similarly, suggesting that extracellular Ca2+ was required for the initiation of the hydrolysis rather than affecting phospholipase C affinity for its substrates. We concluded that activation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis by perturbation of the TCR complex in the Th cell clones under investigation displays a Ca2+-dependent component which is likely to be proximal to IP generation.\r"

In most experiments, 4.7 x 10(-7) M and 2.5 x 10(-8) M adenosine caused 50% suppression of H2O2 release in response to TNF-alpha and FMLP, respectively, and 10 microM caused 100% suppression. Preexposure of neutrophils to ADP blocked the inhibitory effect of adenosine. With adherent neutrophils, there is a prolonged lag period in the onset of the respiratory burst in response to cytokines. Adenosine was fully suppressive if its addition was delayed past the first third of this lag period, or if it was removed during the last third of the lag period. A 10-min pulse with adenosine was most inhibitory when delivered in the middle third of the lag period. Dihydrocytochalasin B abolished the suppressive effect of adenosine on H2O2 release in response to FMLP. Thus adenosine, at concentrations found in human plasma, is a potent but selective inhibitor of the respiratory burst of adherent human neutrophils in response to physiologic, soluble stimuli, and ADP is a potentially physiologic counter-suppressant. Adenosine appears to exert most of its effect during a discrete interval within the lag period before onset of the respiratory burst, and may affect the coupling of agonist receptors to the cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of endothelial cells (ENDO) to human neutrophil cathepsin G (CG) increases albumin flux across the endothelial monolayer. Since calcium influences cell shape and barrier function of ENDO monolayers, the current study was designed to determine if CG acted through alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis in ENDO. The role of Ca2+ in the increased permeability of ENDO monolayers to albumin after exposure to CG was studied by using ENDO monolayers cultured on polycarbonate filters. Exposure of ENDO monolayers to CG in the presence of the Ca2+-antagonist lanthanum partially prevented the increase in albumin flux, but exposure in the presence of agents that block voltage-regulated calcium channels did not block the increase in albumin flux. To monitor the effect of CG on Ca2+-flux, ENDO were labeled with 45Ca2+ and changes in Ca2+ flux were monitored by the release of 45Ca2+. From 1 to 15 minutes after exposure of ENDO to CG, there was increased release of 45Ca2+ compared with control cells. Calcium channel blocking agents did not inhibit the increased release of 45Ca2+, but lanthanum partially blocked the increase. The increased release of Ca2+ appeared to be due, at least in part, to activation of phospholipase C because there was an increase both in inositol polyphosphate species and in diglycerides after incubation of ENDO with CG. These studies support the hypothesis that CG increases the flux of calcium in ENDO, that this increase in Ca2+ flux may result from activation of phospholipase C, and that this system may be involved in the decreased barrier properties of the ENDO after CG exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The role of complement receptors on monocyte derived human macrophages in phagocytosis of infective (MP) and noninfective (LP) developmental stages of Leishmania major promastigotes was studied. We compared binding of these specific developmental stages to MO after preincubation in fresh or heat-inactivated serum. Although LP do not require fresh serum for attachment, MP were dependent on serum C opsonization for entry. Inhibition of CR1 substantially abolished binding of the infective MP. In contrast, inhibition of iC3bR (CR3 and p150,95) had no effect on MP binding. Inhibition of both iC3bR, however, did block binding of nonopsonized LP. Attachment of LP to CR3 was blocked by fluid phase addition of mAb OKM1 and M1/70, which inhibit complement-independent binding to CR3, but not by mAb OKM10 which inhibits iC3b binding to this receptor. After fresh serum pretreatment of LP, however, only simultaneous inhibition of CR3 and CR1 effectively blocked their attachment. Addition of mannan did not inhibit attachment of either promastigote stage. Both opsonized and nonopsonized LP trigger a respiratory burst in MO, possibly via the C independent site in CR3, whereas the CR1-mediated uptake of MP does not generate a respiratory burst. The use of this receptor by MP may facilitate their subsequent intracellular survival.\r"

  ".W": "The pathologic role of the specific immune and inflammatory responses to viral infections of the CNS was investigated by using mice which are susceptible (SJL/J) and resistant (C57Bl6 and BALB/c) to the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Intracerebral inoculation of 10(4) PFU of Sindbis virus (SV) into 6- to 8-wk-old SJL/J mice resulted in a severe and sometimes fatal encephalomyelitis. A mild to severe hind leg paralysis was observed around days 6 to 7 postinfection (pi) which closely resembled EAE stages and persisted for up to 8 wk pi. Immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide on day 4 alleviated the severity of this disease. Significant perivascular and parenchymal infiltration was present in the brains and spinal cords of SV-infected SJL/J mice for up to 1 mo. This apparent immunopathologic reaction was found to be a characteristic of SJL/J mice, because infection of 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c and C57Bl6 mice with SV did not cause paralytic disease. These mice also exhibited a significantly milder cellular infiltrate which was mostly resolved on day 12 to 14 pi. Titers of virus in the brain and spinal cords of mice were comparable with clearance by day 7 pi. SV-specific lymphoproliferation and serum antibody responses were also comparable in all mice. SV-infected SJL/J mice developed antibodies to myelin components as demonstrated in Western blots and responded to myelin basic protein by lymphoproliferation. Lymph node cells from these mice, after in vitro challenge with myelin basic protein, transferred a mild EAE-like disease to naive recipients and potentiated subclinical EAE into a severe disease.\r"

  ".W": "Using both hamster and mouse models of infection, we documented that the virulence of Leishmania donovani chagasi promastigotes decreases over time, when parasites are maintained in long term culture after isolation from an infected animal. Concomitant with this loss of virulence is a marked decrease in amount of the major promastigote surface glycoprotein, gp63, present in promastigotes. The latter was shown by a decrease in binding of polyclonal anti-gp63 serum to attenuated (cultivated long term) as compared to virulent (recently isolated) promastigotes, using immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. Binding of Con A to promastigote glycoproteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, documented a similar decrease. An alteration in the mechanism of promastigote attachment to macrophages was also noted: purified gp63 inhibited attachment of virulent promastigotes to human monocyte-derived macrophages, but it did not affect the attachment of attenuated promastigotes. Northern blot analysis showed that, despite marked differences in the amount of gp63 protein, the quantity of gp63 RNA was comparable in attenuated and virulent promastigotes. However, virulent promastigotes contained two major gp63 RNA species of 3.0 and 2.7 kb, whereas attenuated promastigotes had one predominant gp63 RNA of 2.7 kb and only minor amounts of 3.0 kb RNA. Thus, the decrease in gp63 expression in attenuated, contrasted to virulent, promastigotes is associated with qualitative, but not quantitative, differences in the gp63 messenger RNA.\r"

Several mAb were selected for further study based on their preliminary target cell binding characteristics. Flow cytometry demonstrated that each of these mAb bound to a series of NK-sensitive target cells of various origins (e.g., K562 and Molt-4) while having little or no reactivity with several NK-resistant target cell lines (e.g., SB and Daudi). Functional studies revealed that two of the mAb were able to inhibit the lysis of NK-sensitive K562 target cells by freshly isolated, endogenous NK cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Further, these mAb also could inhibit the killing of K562 target cells by both activated NK cells and cultured lymphokine-activated killer cells, as well as the cytolysis of other NK-sensitive target cells by each of these effector cell populations. Control experiments with another mAb which bound to the target cells but did not inhibit lysis implied that the effects of these mAb on NK cell function was not the result of steric hindrance. Single cell conjugate assays demonstrated that the mAb inhibited NK cell lysis via the inhibition of binding (recognition). Biochemical analysis of this target cell structure revealed that it was a molecule of approximately 42 kDa which may exist as a homodimer in its native state. Thus, it appears that the mAbs identify an unique Ag on the surface of NK cell-sensitive target cells which is involved in NK cell Ag recognition.\r"

  ".W": "The adoptive transfer of sensitized lymphocytes is an effective means to mediate the regression of established tumors. However, successful therapy can only be demonstrated in animal models where tumors are intrinsically immunogenic, capable of eliciting systemic immunity. To explore the potential of this therapeutic approach to tumors of less immunogenicity, we have selected and used a murine tumor, MCA 102, for the current study because all attempts to immunize syngeneic mice failed. We report here that inoculation of mice with a mixture of tumor cells and a bacterial adjuvant, Corynebacterium parvum led to the production of sensitized, but not fully functional, lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes (LN). These cells, termed pre-effector cells, could nevertheless further differentiate to acquire full immunologic function by an established in vitro sensitization culture method. In adoptive immunotherapy experiments, transfer of as few as 1.5 X 10(7) in vitro sensitized cells not only reduced established pulmonary MCA 102 metastases but also prolonged survival and cured tumors in a majority of the treated animals. In order to elicit pre-effector cells in vivo, inoculation with both tumor cells and C. parvum was essential. Although a broad range of numbers of MCA 102 tumor cells appeared to be effective, generation of pre-effector cells was dependent on the dose of C. parvum. We have found that a C. parvum dose of 25 micrograms was optimal, whereas higher doses of the adjuvant had suppressive effects. Analysis of the kinetics of their appearance revealed that the generation of pre-effector cells was transient. They were detectable 7 days after in vivo priming followed by a rapid decline. Furthermore, pre-effector cells were detected only in the regional draining LN. No reactivity was demonstrable in the spleen, mesenteric LN, PBL, or bone marrow. Taken together, these results expand the scope of immunotherapy by demonstrating the feasibility of manipulating a limited and obscure immune response to the MCA 102 tumor for therapeutic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary protein excretion were determined during a lifelong follow-up period in male WAG/Rij rats, unilaterally nephrectomized (NX) just after weaning, and compared with changes in control rats with both kidneys intact (2K). After surgery, the animals were given either a low-protein (LP; 12%), normal-protein (NP; 24%) or high-protein (HP; 36%) diet. The GFR of 2K-rats was highest with the HP diet and lowest with the LP diet. With all three diets, the GFR of 2K rats remained stable for about 2 years. The mean survival time of 2K rats was not affected by the dietary protein intake and amounted to about 120 weeks. Initially, the GFR of NX rats was highest with the HP and lowest with the LP diet. The GFR remained stable for a period of 36 weeks with the HP diet, 48 weeks with the NP diet, and 72 weeks with the LP diet. Subsequently, the GFR fell linearly in the great majority of cases with all three diets. The highest rate of decline was found in NX rats given the HP diet. As a result, from week 72, the GFR of the NX rats on the LP diet was significantly higher than that of NX rats on either the NP or the HP diet. With all three diets the mean survival time of NX rats was less than that of 2K rats on the same diet. The mean survival time of NX rats on the HP diet was also less than that of NX rats on the LP or NP diet. Proteinuria preceded the fall in GFR in NX rats. The proteinuria was most severe in NX rats on the HP diet, but only moderate with the LP diet. We conclude that, in a rat strain not very prone to develop renal lesions, the GFR of a solitary kidney eventually declines. An LP diet postpones but does not prevent the decline.\r"
