There are only six previously reported cases of this unusual complication; these are reviewed. A case is described of syringomyelia which developed 1 year after TBM. One year later magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated not only the spontaneous resolution of the syringomyelia but also the appearance of a new cavity within the brain stem. This surprising sequence of events illustrates the need for extensive studies of the natural history of syrinxes of differing aetiologies.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of different regimens of therapy for parenchymal brain cysticercosis either with praziquantel (PZQ) or with albendazole (ALB) was compared in 114 patients. Four schemes of treatment were used: PZQ 50 mg/kg per day for 15 days, PZQ 50 mg/kg per day for 8 days, ALB 15 mg/kg per day for 30 days, and ALB 15 mg/kg per day for 8 days. Three months after therapy, it was apparent that both PZQ and ALB were effective, as shown by the disappearance of cystic lesions in computed tomographic scans. Thirty-three control patients followed for a mean of 11 months had no spontaneous remission of lesions. When comparing PZQ with ALB, the latter was found to be more effective than the former for both the full and the short course of treatment: 85% vs 60% and 85% vs 48% disappearance of lesions, respectively (P less than 0.001). Comparison of the full vs the short course of PZQ showed that the short course had a further 12% reduction in drug effectiveness. In contrast, the length of ALB therapy could be shortened without lessening its efficacy. Based on these results, an 8-day course of ALB is recommended as treatment for parenchymal brain cysticercosis; a 15-day course of PZQ could be subsequently used in those patients who show only partial response to ALB.\r"

  ".W": "Yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) has been recommended for men and women over age 50 years as part of a screening regimen intended to reduce colorectal cancer mortality. The primary targets of screening are early, surgically curable colon cancers and large adenomatous colon polyps; however, screening may sometimes reveal only small adenomas (ie, less than 1 cm in diameter). To assess the rates and mechanisms of FOBT detection of small adenomas, we performed quantitative analyses utilizing estimates of adenoma bleeding rates and FOBT sensitivity and specificity. The analysis suggests that the mechanisms of detection of small adenomas is often chance or serendipity. This occurs when an FOBT result is \"falsely\" positive because of diet or non-neoplastic gastrointestinal bleeding and leads to colonoscopic discovery of a nonbleeding small adenoma. Nevertheless, small adenomas remain undetected in most persons who have them, even if repeated yearly FOBT screening is done. The identification of persons with small adenomas should not be assumed to be an important beneficial outcome of FOBT screening, because the clinical significance of small adenomas is not clear, the mechanism of detection is serendipity, and only a minority of persons with small adenomas are identified. The current recommendations to perform periodic surveillance colonoscopy following removal of small adenomas detected during FOBT screening should be reexamined.\r"

During the 30-month follow-up, 19.8% and 7.8% of the initially seronegative HBV and HIV-1 groups were estimated to seroconvert to HBV and HIV-1, respectively. The significantly higher cumulative HBV seroconversion rate occurred despite a much lower prevalence of hepatitis B carriers (7% were hepatitis B surface antigen positive) compared with HIV-1 carriers (22% were HIV-1 antibody positive). The sexual exposure profile of HBV and HIV-1 seroconverters was similar during the 6 months prior to seroconversion, supporting the link between anal intercourse and acquisition of either infection. However, insertive, not receptive, anal intercourse was the major risk factor identified for HBV seroconversion, suggesting that transurethral exposure is an important mode of transmission. These data suggest that HBV is transmitted 8.6-fold more efficiently than HIV-1 among homosexual men studied and underscore the benefits of both HBV immunization and use of condoms during intercourse to prevent HBV infection.\r"

The pathological types included 23 hepatocelluler carcinoma (HCC), 11 hepatic cavernous hemangioma, and 2 secondary liver cancer. In 22 patients, the tumor nodules were located in the right lobe and 14 cases in the left lobe. The diagnostic accuracy rate of CT was 100% for HCC and secondary liver cancer, but for hepatic cavernous hemangioma it was only 72.2%. However, the accuracy rate of sonography was as high as 81.8% for hepatic cavernous hemangioma and only 60.4% for liver malignancies. The positive rate of AFP for the HCC patients of this series was only 66.6%. The method of intraoperative detection of small liver tumor is introduced, if the tumor was invisible grossly or nonpalpable during exploratory laparotomy. In the series, 7 cases in whom the right lobe lesion was too small to be located by routine manual examination during exploratory laparotomy were detected by this method, and all small liver tumors were resected successfully.\r"

After exclusions, the results of 1014 women were available for analysis; 118 (12%) of them had persistently abnormal waveforms on repeat ultrasound scans at 24 weeks and were taken to have a positive test result. Hypertension was significantly more frequent among those women than among women with normal doppler waveforms (29/118 [25%] vs 45/896 [5%]). In addition, hypertension in women with abnormal waveforms was more likely to be severe; 12 (10%) had proteinuria and 15 (13%) intrauterine growth retardation compared with 7 (0.8%) and 0, respectively, of those with normal waveforms. Overall, the test did poorly when assessed by standard statistical means. However, the sensitivity was high for hypertension associated with either proteinuria (63%) or intrauterine growth retardation (100%). The test is cheap, easy to carry out, and non-invasive, and it can be done in early pregnancy; it is therefore a useful means of identifying a high-risk group of pregnant women suitable for therapeutic intervention to reduce the incidence of hypertensive disorders and their complications.\r"

The curettings were examined histologically. All histologically classified endometrial carcinomas were associated with an endometrial thickness of at least 4 mm. Endometrial cancer was found in 12.6% in the postmenopausal bleeding group (n = 103) and in 3.5% in the symptom-free group (n = 283). Vaginosonography is thus a good method of screening for uterine neoplasms in presymptomatic women--those with endometrial thickness of 4 mm or greater should undergo curettage and histological examination.\r"

  ".U": "90286869\r", 
  ".W": "The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of fat. The available data, though sometimes controversial, clearly indicate that muscular exercise affects almost every aspect of fat metabolism in this organ. Neither acute exercise nor training affects total lipid, phospholipid, or cholesterol concentrations in the liver of rats fed chow or low fat diets. However, exercise training reduces accumulation of total hepatic fat and cholesterol in rats fed a fat-rich diet. In addition, training seems to increase both the synthesis and catabolism of cholesterol in the liver in rats fed a chow diet. Production of ketones by the liver increases both during prolonged exercise and during recovery from exercise. Acute prolonged exercise reduces the activities of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and increases oxidation of fatty acids by the liver. This type of work also increases the esterification of fatty acids with the subsequent accumulation of triacylglycerols in this organ. Training does not affect triacylglycerol concentration in the liver of rats fed a chow diet but attenuates its accumulation after a fat-rich diet. Training reduces the postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity. Finally, it reduces production of triacylglycerols and increases production of high density lipoprotein cholesterol by the liver. A large body of descriptive information has been published indicating that exercise has a dramatic effect upon hepatic lipid metabolism. The next step in this work is the identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for these exercise-induced alterations.\r"

The time course for alterations in B-EP and the relationship to lactate were also examined. Following the VO2max test, the three submaximal intensities were completed on separate days using a counter-balanced design. Blood was sampled from an indwelling venous catheter at rest during exercise and recovery to assess the time course response. B-EP content was determined by radioimmunoassay (Immunonuclear) with less than 5% cross-reactivity to B-LPH. At rest, B-EP content was similar across visits, 4.34 +/- 0.36 pmol.l-1. The 60% intensity did not elevate B-EP at any time measured. B-EP content increased by 15 min at 70% VO2max with a further increase at 30 min. B-EP remained elevated during the 20 min recovery. At 80% VO2max B-EP content increased by 5 min. B-EP continued to increase during the exercise and peaked at 21.91 +/- 2.03 pmol.l-1 5 min into the recovery. Lactate showed a mild correlation with B-EP (r = 0.43) at 80% VO2max. A significant correlation (r = 0.78) between lactate and B-EP did occur with the VO2max test. It is concluded that an exercise intensity of at least 70% VO2max for 15 min is needed to increase plasma B-EP. Furthermore, the higher the exercise intensity the more rapid the onset for increases in plasma B-EP.\r"

The usual reason for referral for electromyographic studies in the newborn and young infant is to evaluate a floppy baby. The electromyographer must not only be aware of important differences in normal physiologic parameters but must also be familiar with a spectrum of diseases that are not typically encountered in the adult. The results of electromyography must also be correlated with the normal maturation of neuromuscular function. Although the most common pathophysiologic mechanisms affecting the peripheral motor unit are infantile motor neuron disease and the congenital myopathies, a large number of other disease entities warrant careful consideration.\r"

For this purpose, we developed a sensitive immunoperoxidase technique to visualize MEnk-positive patches in routinely prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded striatal tissues. In comparison with normal controls, MEnk-positive patches and pallidal MEnk-positive axon terminals were strongly present in patients with PD, showing characteristic distribution patterns. By comparison, in SND patients, there was striking diminution of MEnk staining in the putamen and ventrolateral portion of the GPe, while MEnk patches were persistent in the caudate nucleus.\r"

We compared the results with brain sections studied in the same fashion from 10 PML patients without AIDS. The pathology of JCV infection in AIDS was similar to non-AIDS PML except for minor differences in degree. AIDS-associated pathologic material showed a greater tendency toward necrosis and a higher density of JCV-infected cells. Replication of JCV was restricted to glial cells in all tissue studied. Bizarre astrocytes were less frequent in the AIDS patients, and perivascular inflammatory cells were more frequent. We could not demonstrate JCV in macrophages or microglial cells known to harbor HIV infection. In situ hybridization with nonradioactive probes serves as a useful technique for the confirmation of PML in AIDS.\r"

In myasthenia gravis (MG), autoantibodies are directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction. We examined the peripheral blood leukocytes of MG patients (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) for the presence of Leu-1+ B lymphocytes. A fraction of B-1 (CD20)+ cells expressed Leu-1 at a low density. There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of Leu-1+ B cells between patients and controls. We observed 2 frequency ranges of Leu-1+ B cells (0 to 30% and above 30%), which were not related to the total percentage of B-1+ cells in the blood. Fifty-seven percent of MG patients had a high frequency of Leu-1+ B cells compared with 13% of controls.\r"

  ".W": "In the past two decades there have been dramatic changes in antenatal fetal assessment. As experience has been gained with new modalities, it has been possible to further decrease perinatal morbidity and mortality by modifying the indications and the frequency of testing, as well as the time of initiation. More antepartum assessment is performed today than ever before with the advent of new procedures. With the increasing complexity of multiple modalities and confounding risk factors it has become necessary to individualize the management of each high-risk pregnancy. The clinician should attempt to identify which test or group of tests will insure the lowest perinatal mortality for a given risk factor. The specific test(s) utilized will depend on the population, the expertise of the personnel administering the test, and the manpower and equipment available. Antenatal fetal assessment is usually not performed unless one is prepared to modify obstetric management or expedite delivery when significant abnormalities are identified. The risks of delivery (maternal and neonatal) must then be weighed against the potential adverse effects of continuing the pregnancy. It should be recognized that there is no single \"best test\" for all clinical situations. It is important for the practicing physician to keep abreast of new developments in antenatal assessment and to be aware of recommended modifications in older applications.\r"

  ".U": "90287504\r", 
  ".W": "No currently available single test of fetal well-being is a universal, infallible clinical tool that stands apart from the more general context of the total pregnancy. It is tempting to place a substantial emphasis on the results of a test when medical decision-making is needed. Perhaps some sense of proportion should be invoked at this point, beginning with the recognition that fetal heart rate data, regardless of how they are obtained, provide a limited window to view the fetus and its environment. The fact remains that the relatively low incidence of real fetal compromise and subsequent poor outcomes biases the efficacy of the NST and other well-being tools. Most high-risk populations have a prevalence of poor outcomes of approximately 10 per cent; consequently, the target population for any assessment test is quite small. One must be reassured by the extremely large reported experience of Platt et al that nonstress testing is clinically useful in the overwhelming majority of cases. The NST appears to be an excellent predictor of the healthy fetus. The test is very good at predicting the fetus who does not require acute or premature obstetric intervention: it thereby prevents pregnancies from being subjected to unnecessary iatrogenic risks and from incurring tremendous medical and emotional costs. Can the NST be improved? I think that there is still considerable opportunity for making this test more effective and accurate. Our experience supports the concepts of standardized testing conditions, the use of baseline data in addition to reactivity alone, the prolongation of test sessions to achieve a more representative view of the fetus, and ultimately an automated analysis that will aid the clinician in making more reliable assessments of the fetal heart rate data present in the actual tracing. It would be useful to see the NST better integrated into management schemes that incorporate other assessment techniques as well as pertinent clinical data. The tendency to view the test as a \"stand alone\" modality has underscored weaknesses inherent in all surveillance methods that have a naturally limited perspective on complex developmental and adaptive problems. There is also a need for the development of academic standards so that collected experiences can be directly compared and communication of testing results made less ambiguous. These are some of the goals that should be set for the future and whose realization will effect better care for the unique population served by obstetricians.\r"

The cumulative data indicate that the method is sensitive for recognizing both the normal and compromised fetus. Moreover, the method appears to offer the advantage of grading various degrees of fetal compromise. The additional information gained by real-time ultrasound scanning (gestational age determination, fetal morphometrics, and fetal anomaly screening), while not an integral part of fetal biophysical profile scoring, nevertheless remains a critical aspect of antepartum fetal assessment. These data are collected simultaneously with the fetal biophysical profile score. It is impossible to separate cleanly the advantages of fetal biophysical profile scoring in isolation of this additional information collected. It would seem that such an attempt at separation is artificial since these data in combination provide more key information to the physician to guide fetal management. It seems reasonable to effect continued modification and improvement of the existing fetal biophysical profile score as a means of antepartum fetal risk assessment.\r"

Numerous studies have demonstrated not only the feasibility, but also the diagnostic efficacy of this approach. The latter is particularly true in relation to the Doppler evaluation of the umbilical circulation in various complications of pregnancy. Although these findings do not establish the role of Doppler technology as a standard of practice, they clearly demonstrate its immense potential as a fetal surveillance technique.\r"

This may permit early diagnosis of abnormal fetuses, increasing the options for patients. As pregnancy progresses, high-resolution ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume is integral to the management of pregnancies at risk for oligohydramnios. Such pregnancies include those who are postdate and those with suspected intrauterine growth retardation. Additional evaluation and ultrasonography are recommended for evaluation of the fetus in this clinical situation. With either hydramnios or oligohydramnios, careful ultrasound assessment of the fetus is essential to rule out significant congenital malformations. Finally, the use of ultrasound-directed amniocentesis in later pregnancy permits an assessment of fetal lung maturity and of the fetus at risk for Rhesus immunization. Attention to detail should increase chances of a successful pregnancy outcome while decreasing neonatal morbidity and mortality.\r"

It is evident that intrauterine hypoxia is a rare cause of central nervous system injury, and the finding of a normal acid-base status at birth should lead the clinician to search for other causes of central nervous system injury or birth depression. A combination of techniques including fetal acid-base assessment, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and thorough neonatal evaluation probably provides the best predictor of long-term outcome. Newer methods of umbilical cord sampling and acid-base determinations in the intrauterine growth retarded fetus hold some hope for the future.\r"

The positive predictive value is excellent (greater than 99 per cent). The fetus who responds to the stimulus with an acceptable acceleration is uniformly nonacidotic. Like many other tests of fetal health, vibroacoustic stimulation is less useful in predicting fetuses in distress, as many fail to respond and yet show no signs of compromise. It is evident that there is no single test that is without false-positives; thus accurate assessment of fetal health will depend upon utilization of a variety of biophysical parameters.\r"

Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of these foreign particles disclosed Ca, Al, Si, Ti, and P in most lesions. However, other elements such as Zr, V, Ag, and Ni were found only in specific biopsy specimens. By comparing the elemental analyses, clinical features, and history of the lesions, strong evidence for an iatrogenic source of the foreign material was found in one case, and good evidence in five cases. In the remaining two patients, the source of the foreign particles remains unresolved.\r"

The teeth were evaluated with stimuli from an electric pulp tester, cold, and air. The electric pulp tester was found to be reliable in assessing the pulpal sensitivity. Neither the amount of periodontal destruction nor the extent of periodontal treatment had any effect on the pulp. Scaling and root planing had no significant effect on root sensitivity. Periodontal surgery was directly related to root sensitivity in terms of the extent of root surface exposure. An association was observed clinically between plaque accumulation after periodontal surgery and root sensitivity.\r"

The PST is a simple, clinically applicable, quantitative measure of an individual's ability to withstand a series of graded destabilizing forces applied at the level of the subject's waist. Elderly fallers tend to score lower on the PST than elderly nonfallers, but age-related differences in postural responses during the PST have not been established. Each subject underwent the PST using a method and scoring procedure described previously. Results of this study confirm previous findings that elderly fallers score significantly lower on the PST than either young adult or nonfalling elderly individuals. This study also showed that there was no difference in balance strategy scores between the young adults and the healthy elderly subjects. Therefore, it appears that poor performance on the PST cannot be attributed to age alone, but may be predictive of pathological processes that predispose an individual to frequent falls.\r"

Five barefoot baseline sessions were conducted. Following these baseline sessions, the three conditions were randomly varied during each of 12 alternating-treatment sessions. Data analysis revealed a significant improvement in walking velocity, step length, and stance time on the hemiparetic limb and a significant decrease in cadence when either the AFO or the TIAFO condition was compared with the barefoot condition. The TIAFO was associated with a significant increase in walking velocity and step length when evaluated against the prefabricated AFO. The subject reported that use of the TIAFO increased his ability to ambulate distances and that the TIAFO was more comfortable and less restrictive than the prefabricated AFO. The results suggest that the TIAFO may be a promising alternative to conventional orthotic management of adults with hemiparesis.\r"

In these systems, transgenic proteins are not detected in the thymus or other lymphoid tissues.

The RC pigments are bound primarily by two homologous peptides, the L and M subunits, each containing five transmembrane helices. These alpha helices and pigments are arranged in an approximate C2 symmetry and form two possible electron transfer pathways. Only one of these pathways is actually used. In an attempt to identify nonhomologous residues that are responsible for functional differences between the two branches, homologous helical regions that interact extensively with the pigments were genetically symmetrized (that is, exchanged). For example, replacement of the fourth transmembrane helix (D helix) in the M subunit with the homologous helix from the L subunit yields photosynthetically inactive RCs lacking a critical photoactive pigment. Photosynthetic revertants have been isolated in which single amino acid substitutions (intragenic suppressors) compensate for this partial symmetrization.\r"

If the patient's annual growth failed to increase more than 2 cm above baseline, the dose interval was changed from weekly to three times a week or from three times a week to daily. In the second year of the study, all patients received daily injections. Despite a mean duration of previous treatment with growth hormone of more than 3 years, daily injections in 16 patients throughout the first year of the study resulted in a mean growth velocity (9.6 +/- 2.4 cm) comparable to that in newly treated patients given met-GH three times weekly in other trials. Administration by daily injection was more effective than injection three times per week (P less than .05) in 13 patients (7.9 +/- 2.1 cm) or once a week in four patients (7.7 +/- 1.2 cm). Second year growth velocities in 21 patients who had received once-a-week or three-times-a-week injections the first year of the study, increased significantly with a change to daily injection (7.7 +/- 2.2 vs 8.8 +/- 1.9 cm) (P less than .05).\r"

During the chronic phase of stroke, normal blood pressure persists in 26% of these patients. The three phases of blood pressure change after stroke are likely a physiologic response to ischemia of the brain followed by recovery of brain function. The identification of these three states of blood pressure in stroke underlines the importance of prudence and caution in administering antihypertensive drugs to patients who have had a stroke.\r"

Clinical and radiographic criteria for ankylosing spondylitis were met. In addition to classic Whipple's arthropathy, he had the combined but singular findings of pancarpal destruction and cervical apophyseal fusion. HLA typing revealed the B7 antigen. This case illustrates the pitfalls in diagnosis of a chronic polyarthritis that has, as a typical feature, a long latency before manifesting its more specific signs and symptoms (ie, diarrhea, malabsorption, and hyperpigmentation). Care should be taken during evaluation of any disease with atypical and nonspecific features (eg, positive rheumatoid factor in a patient with polyarthritis) and one should continue to reevaluate the original impression while confirmatory evidence is lacking. Moreover, the roentgenographic findings of pancarpal narrowing, apophyseal fusion, and advanced iliofemoral joint disease, in addition to sacroiliitis and syndesmophyte formation, challenge the generally held notion that Whipple's arthropathy is a nondestructive joint disease.\r"

Operation showed a left-sided obturator hernia. In any elderly, debilitated, chronically ill woman, symptoms and signs of recurrent small-bowel obstruction (without a history of abdominal surgery or external hernias) and pain along the ipsilateral thigh and knee (Howship-Romberg sign) should raise suspicion for an obturator hernia. If the hernia is not palpable by physical examination, a CT scan of the pelvis and upper aspect of the thigh would confirm the diagnosis before operation and allow prompt treatment and better chance of patient survival.\r"

The absence of skin and renal involvement, the presence of normal serum complement, and the poor response to corticosteroids in this patient are of interest. Pulmonary disease produced by childhood SLE may represent, as in adults, a subgroup of SLE disease. Our report emphasizes the importance of recognizing diffuse interstitial infiltrates as an initial symptom of childhood SLE even in the absence of more obvious signs.\r"

Asthma symptoms, additional puffs of beta 2 agonist, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and side effects were recorded daily. During treatment with formoterol the patients used fewer additional puffs of beta 2 agonist, had better symptom scores, less disturbed sleep, more days without additional aerosol, and higher PEF both morning and evening than during salbutamol treatment. Thus formoterol 24 micrograms twice daily gave long lasting bronchodilatation and asthma symptoms were well controlled with regular twice daily administration.\r"

Furthermore, the knowledge that these lesions are often sexually transmitted and the ever-increasing concern over child abuse have combined to make the recognition and treatment of this disease in the pediatric population of even greater significance. Depending on location, podophyllum resin (podophyllin) is the initial therapy of choice. Available studies indicate a cure rate ranging from 22% to 98% depending on location of the warts, frequency of treatment, patient compliance, and freshness of the podophyllum resin preparation. Cure rates of 91% to 97% have been reported with cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation. Eradication of the viral agent and long-term follow-up are important.\r"

For the two-day study period, the daily dosage was limited to 8 mg (40 ml) for loperamide-treated subjects and to 4.9 g for bismuth subsalicylate-treated subjects. At these dosages, loperamide significantly reduced the average number of unformed bowel movements relative to bismuth subsalicylate. Following the initial dose of treatment, control of diarrhea was maintained significantly longer with loperamide than with bismuth subsalicylate. Time to last unformed stool was significantly shorter with loperamide than with bismuth subsalicylate. In providing overall subjective relief, subjects rated loperamide significantly better than bismuth subsalicylate at the end of the 24 hours. Both treatments were well tolerated, and none of the minor adverse effects reported resulted in discontinuation of therapy. It was concluded that loperamide is effective at a daily dosage limit of 8 mg (40 ml) for the treatment of acute nonspecific diarrhea and provides faster, more effective relief than bismuth subsalicylate.\r"

The clinical presentation of acute diarrhea may lead clinicians to consider certain causative agents, but it is not diagnostic of any specific cause. Clinical laboratory studies can detect or isolate pathogens in only a minority of cases. By the time this information is available, patients have usually recovered. For these reasons, early self-treatment aimed at reducing symptoms of acute diarrhea is recommended.\r"

Renal biopsy specimens were obtained from nine patients with IgA nephropathy and nine patients with other glomerular diseases. Mononuclear cells obtained from two patients with IgA nephropathy and two healthy adults were transformed with EBV and the supernatant of such transformed cell culture was applied to acid (pH 3.2)-treated renal sections obtained from the same and other patients with IgA nephropathy, as well as to those with other glomerular diseases. The sections were stained with FITC-labeled heavy chain-specific anti-human IgA antiserum and then examined with a fluorescent microscope. It was demonstrated that IgA in the supernatant specifically bound with the glomerular mesangial areas in patients with IgA nephropathy, while it did not bind with such areas in patients with other glomerular diseases. Although IgA in such samples bound with autologous renal tissues, about 50% bound with allogeneic renal specimens of IgA nephropathy. IgA in the supernatant of transformed lymphocytes from healthy adults was not bound with the glomerular mesangial areas of patients with IgA nephropathy and other glomerular diseases. It is concluded that IgA in the supernatant of lymphocytes by EB virus transformation is specific to the mesangial areas of IgA nephropathy and that some heterogeneity is seen among patients with this disease.\r"

In 18 controls, small numbers of CNS microvessels were ICAM-1-positive. There were more numerous ICAM-1-positive vessels in active MS plaque edges, viral encephalitis lesions, infarcts, and in six controls. Within active MS plaques and in viral infections, mononuclear cells and some glia also were ICAM-1-positive. Mononuclear but not CNS resident cells were LFA-1-positive. Thus, CNS vessel ICAM-1 expression is variable in amount in postmortem samples of normal human CNS tissue, may increase early and focally in cellular immune reactions, and, via binding of LFA-1, may promote leukocyte influx into the CNS. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on parenchymal cells may indicate additional interactions with LFA-1 on inflammatory cells in diverse CNS lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of hormones in endocrine tumors and derived cell lines of transgenic mice carrying insulin-promoted oncogenes has been investigated by histochemical, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and radioimmunologic means. Tumors of the pancreas, small intestine, mesentery, and liver were examined. Insulin-immunoreactive cells were prevalent in pancreatic tumors, with a significant subpopulation of pancreatic polypeptide-immunoreactive elements. Conventional ultrastructural and immunogold analysis identified insulin-storing beta granules in pancreatic tumor cells. In contrast, the largest immunoreactive subpopulation of intestinal tumors expressed secretin (53% of total cells), followed by proglucagon-related peptides (15%), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (7%), gastrin (7%), pancreatic polypeptide (2%), neurotensin (2%), and somatostatin (1%). No detectable immunoreactivity for either insulin or serotonin was observed. Electron microscopy and immunogold labeling showed that intestinal tumor cells contained secretin-storing S-type granules. Lymph node and liver tumors contained secretin-immunoreactive cells with ultrastructural features similar to those of intestinal tumors. In addition, high levels of circulating insulinlike and secretinlike immunoreactants were detectable. Analogous hormone profiles were identified in tumor cell lines and culture media. Large T-antigen immunoreactivity was detected in all the nuclei of neoplastic cells, as well as in insulin-immunoreactive elements of non-neoplastic islets and pancreatic ducts and in some secretin-immunoreactive cells of small intestinal mucosa. These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors arise both in beta cell and S-cell subpopulations of transgenic mice.\r"

To immortalize the \"CD-reactive antigen(s),\" the authors fused the lymphoid cells from a CD tissue filtrate primed nu/nu mouse with nonsecretory mouse myeloma cells. Hybrids were screened and selected based on their reactivity with CD serum IgG, but not with control serum IgG in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF). Two CD-positive hybridomas were examined by IF with sera from 47 CD, 38 ulcerative colitis (UC), 13 controls with other gastrointestinal diseases, 19 with autoimmune diseases, and 21 normal subjects. Sera from 16 CD patients (34%) reacted with the two hybridomas, but only one of 38 UC sera and none of the 53 other disease or normal control sera reacted. The immunoreactivity of CD sera was significantly higher than UC sera (P less than 0.01) and each of the other groups (P less than 0.007). Using immunoperoxidase techniques at light and electron microscopic levels, the authors localized CD-associated antigen(s) in the plasma membrane of the two hybridomas. Further characterization of these hybridomas and the immunoreactive protein(s) may provide an important probe(s) for the diagnosis and the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD.\r"

America first tried to pay doctors under Medicare by an involved formula system without a fee schedule, but the effort has failed. The United States has now commissioned a research project to design a unique fee schedule that will precisely reflect physicians' effort and practice costs and that will represent the prices produced by a perfectly competitively market. The primary goal is the same as that pursued recently by reformers in all countries: viz., narrow the spread in fees and income between surgical and cognitive fields. There are serious technical limitations on this effort, despite the talent of the research team. An additional difficulty lies in the nature of the subject: paying the doctor involves conflicts of interest between payers and all doctors as well as among the medical specialties, and the conflicts cannot be resolved by any formulae calculated by any single research team. Methodological and political compromises will be necessary, in order to adopt a reform. The new method may be just as politically driven, complicated, and disputed as the old one, despite America's pretenses that it prefers free markets and opposes excessive government.\r"

Twelve received a continuous infusion of papaveretum, supplemented by bolus doses of midazolam. The level of sedation was assessed every four hours and measurements were made of haemodynamic and respiratory variables. Levels of sedation were generally satisfactory in both groups. Six patients who received propofol required the use of muscle relaxants, because of their strong respiratory drives, to achieve synchronisation with the ventilator. There was no significant difference in respiratory or haemodynamic variables between the groups, but several patients required inotropic support because of their disease. There was no evidence of inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis in the propofol group. Propofol can be a useful sedative agent in the intensive care unit, but sedative regimens should be tailored to individual patient requirements.\r"

The major endpoint for the study was the achievement of clinical beta blockade (heart rate 50-60 beats/min and less than or equal to 20% rise in treadmill stage I heart rate). Betaxolol produced a decrease in mean angina pectoris frequency from 6.6 +/- 1.9 episodes/week with placebo to 0.2 +/- 0.5 episode/week during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005). Mean treadmill exercise time increased from 3.1 +/- 1.7 min with placebo to 7.3 +/- 2.3 min with doses sufficient to reduce angina pectoris frequency greater than or equal to 75% (p less than 0.00005) and to 8.0 +/- 2.3 min during clinical beta blockade (p less than 0.00005). The mean doses of betaxolol required to produce a greater than or equal to 75% decrease in angina pectoris frequency and clinical beta blockade were 12 +/- 5 mg (range 5-40 mg) and 28 +/- 29 mg (range 5-80 mg) respectively. Mean serum concentrations associated with these clinical endpoints were 23.8 +/- 9.7 ng/mL and 59.7 +/- 54.0 ng/mL respectively. The results indicate that betaxolol, in widely ranging doses, is highly effective in reducing angina pectoris frequency and improving exercise capacity in patients with stable exertional angina pectoris.\r"

Captopril decreased mean plasma prolactin from 17.5 +/- 1.4 ng/mL to 9.1 +/- 1.0 ng/mL (p less than 0.001). Significant correlation was found between captopril-induced change from control values of plasma prolactin (delta plasma prolactin) vs delta plasma renin activity (r = -0.688, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that acute administration of captopril was accompanied by a reduction in plasma prolactin and that this reduction may be of clinical significance during therapy of hypertension.\r"

But the increase in forearm vascular resistance to phenylephrine decreased significantly and heart rate increased significantly after insulin injection. In 9 diabetics, vasoconstrictor response to tilting was measured before and after insulin injection. Mean blood pressure, cardiac index, and the total peripheral resistance index remained unchanged after insulin administration. However, the increase in the total peripheral resistance index to tilting decreased significantly and heart rate increased significantly after insulin injection. Furthermore, a significant fall in mean blood pressure following tilting was observed only after insulin administration. Although blood glucose levels decreased significantly, no hypoglycemic symptoms occurred. The present study suggests that insulin inhibits vasoconstrictor responses to both alpha agonist and tilting in diabetics.\r"

The current study was designed to trace the path of translocated intestinal bacteria in a murine HS model. Thirty-one rats were gavaged with 1,000,000 counts of viable 14C oleic acid-labeled Escherichia coli. Forty-eight hours later the animals were bled to 30 mmHg until either 80% of their maximal shed blood was returned or 5 hours of shock had elapsed and they were resuscitated with Ringer's lactate as previously described. Control animals were cannulated but not shocked. Eight rats immediately after shock and resuscitation, 6 rats 24 hours after shock, 3 rats 48 hours after shock, and 4 animals that died in shock had their heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and serum harvested, cultured, and radioactive content measured. Translocated enteric bacteria are found primarily in the lung immediately after shock with redistribution to the liver and kidney 24 hours later. Animals surviving to 48 hours were capable of eliminating the majority of the bacteria from their major organ systems. Positive cultures for E. coli were also found in the blood, lung, liver, and kidney. We speculate that the inflammatory response stimulated by the bacteria in these organs may contribute to the multiple-organ failure syndrome seen after HS.\r"

Twenty-eight patients were randomized to S and 37 to CS; there were six early deaths, which precluded drainage analysis, leaving 24 evaluable S patients and 35 CS patients. Penetrating wounds occurred in 71% and blunt in 29%. No significant differences appeared between the groups with respect to age, Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), or grade of pancreatic injury. Twelve patients in each group required resection and drainage for grade III injuries, with the remaining patients receiving external drainage alone. Five of twenty-four S patients versus one of thirty-five CS patients developed intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.04). We conclude that septic complications after pancreatic injury are significantly reduced by CS drainage. Bacterial contamination via sump catheters is a major source for intra-abdominal infections after pancreatic trauma.\r"

The 3-hour integrated glucose response to a glucose meal decreased from 145.3 +/- 33.7 to 75.8 +/- 15.7 g min/L (p less than 0.02) after GBP. This was associated with a decrease in 3-hour integrated insulin response from 22.8 +/- 8.2 to 10.5 +/- 4.9 mU min/L. Vertical banded gastroplasty patients had lesser reductions of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Neither the CCK, serotonin, nor VIP responses to meals were altered by either operation. The 3-hour integrated enteroglucagon response to glucose increased markedly in GBP patients after operation from 11.8 +/- 6 to 133.4 +/- 38 nmol min/mL (p less than 0.02). This increase in enteroglucagon occurred at the same time as development of dumping symptoms, which occurred exclusively in GBP patients after glucose but not protein. We conclude that (1) GBP surgery for morbid obesity results in amelioration of glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, (2) CCK does not mediate an endocrine satiety effect of surgery, (3) GBP is associated with an exaggerated enteroglucagon response to glucose, and (4) enteroglucagon appears to be a marker of the dumping syndrome in GBP patients.\r"

Blood pressure readings are altered by various factors that influence the patient, the techniques used and the accuracy of the sphygmomanometer. The variability of readings can be reduced if informed patients prepare in advance by emptying their bladder and bowel, by avoiding over-the-counter vasoactive drugs the day of measurement and by avoiding exposure to cold, caffeine consumption, smoking and physical exertion within half an hour before measurement. The use of standardized techniques to measure blood pressure will help to avoid large systematic errors. Poor technique can account for differences in readings of more than 15 mm Hg and ultimately misdiagnosis. Most of the recommended procedures are simple and, when routinely incorporated into clinical practice, require little additional time. The equipment must be appropriate and in good condition. Physicians should have a suitable selection of cuff sizes readily available; the use of the correct cuff size is essential to minimize systematic errors in blood pressure measurement. Semiannual calibration of aneroid sphygmomanometers and annual inspection of mercury sphygmomanometers and blood pressure cuffs are recommended. We review the methods recommended for measuring blood pressure and discuss the factors known to produce large differences in blood pressure readings.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the complex regulation of glucose homeostasis has been dramatically transformed recently by the realization that glucose transport in mammalian tissues is mediated by a family of structurally related but genetically distinct glucose-transporter proteins. The regulatory factors and intracellular signaling pathways that influence expression of the genes encoding these proteins are just being identified. Factors that regulate glucose-transporter gene expression in vitro include oncogenes, growth factors, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, vanadate, glucocorticoids, ambient glucose levels, and the state of cellular differentiation. In vivo, glucose-transporter gene expression in adipose cells, skeletal muscle, and liver is markedly affected by various altered nutritional and metabolic states. Recent studies have demonstrated that two glucose transporters expressed in the same tissue may be regulated differently in response to the same metabolic perturbation. Furthermore, transporter regulation appears to be tissue specific. These observations lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at unraveling the functional roles of the individual transporter species in different tissues, the molecular processes involved in regulating the expression of these genes, and the impact of dysregulated glucose-transporter gene expression in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant states such as diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "We identified the earliest events in autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor after insulin addition. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation at specific sites in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor's beta-subunit is correlated kinetically with activation of kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a model substrate (reduced and carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme; RCAM-lysozyme). To identify these sites, the deduced amino acid sequence of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte insulin receptor of the mouse was determined. Insulin-induced activation of substrate phosphorylation was shown to require autophosphorylation of three neighboring tyrosines (Tyr1148, Tyr1152, and Tyr1153) in the mouse receptor. A search for cellular substrates of the receptor kinase revealed that insulin causes accumulation of a 15,000-Mr phosphorylated (on tyrosine) cytosolic protein (pp15) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with oxophenylarsine (PAO). PAO blocks turnover of the phosphoryl group of pp15, causing its accumulation, and thereby appears to interrupt signal transmission from the receptor to the glucose-transport system. Two membrane-bound protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases that are inhibited by PAO and are apparently responsible for the turnover of the pp15 phosphoryl group have been purified from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and characterized. These and other results support the hypothesis that turnover of the phosphoryl group of pp15, a product of insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase action, couples signal transmission to the glucose-transport system. [32P]pp15 was purified to homogeneity from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Amino acid and radiochemical sequence analysis of the purified tryptic [32P]phosphopeptide revealed that pp15 is the phosphorylation product of 422(aP2) protein, a 15,000-Mr adipocyte protein whose cDNA we previously cloned and sequenced. 422(aP2) protein was found to bind fatty acids. When exposed to a free fatty acid, notably oleic acid, 422(aP2) protein becomes an excellent substrate of the isolated insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase. Compelling evidence indicates that on binding fatty acid, 422(aP2) protein undergoes a conformational change whereby Tyr19 becomes accessible to the receptor tyrosine kinase and undergoes O-phosphorylation. Adipose tissue and skeletal and heart muscle, which exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, express a specific insulin-responsive glucose transporter. A cDNA (GT2) that encodes this protein was isolated from a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte library and sequenced. We also isolated and characterized the corresponding mouse gene GLUT4. DNase I footprinting with nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 cells revealed that a differentiation-specific nuclear factor binds to the GLUT4 promoter. The purified transcription factor C/EBP binds at the same position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The observation that insulin and insulinlike growth factor I receptors can be found in hybrid heterotetramers suggests that insulin receptors can be composed of heterodimers that are the products of separate genes. Such a structure provides a potential molecular mechanism for negative-dominant receptor mutations.\r"

  ".U": "90291869\r", 
  ".W": "Hormonal regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic pathway flux is brought about by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and control of gene expression of several key regulatory enzymes. Regulation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation occurs at the level of pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (6PF-1-K)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-2,6-P2ase). The latter is a unique bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), which is an activator of 6PF-1-K and an inhibitor of Fru-1,6-P2ase. The bifunctional enzyme is a homodimer whose activities are regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation at a single NH2-terminal seryl residue/subunit, which results in activation of the Fru-2,6-P2ase and inhibition of the PF-1-K reactions. Hormone-mediated changes in the phosphorylation state of the bifunctional enzyme are responsible for acute regulation of Fru-2,6-P2 levels. 6PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase thus provides a switching mechanism between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in mammalian liver. Pyruvate kinase is regulated by both phosphorylation and allosteric effectors. Fru-1,6-P2, an allosteric activator, also inhibits cAMP-dependent enzyme phosphorylation, and its steady-state concentration is indirectly determined by the level of Fru-2,6-P2. Therefore, acute regulation of both pyruvate kinase and the bifunctional enzyme provide coordinated control at both the pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate and Fru-6-P/Fru-1,6-P2 substrate cycles. The Fru-2,6-P2 system is also subject to complex multihormonal long-term control through regulation of 6 PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene expression. Glucocorticoids are the major factor in turning on this gene in liver, but insulin is also a positive effector. cAMP prevents the effects of glucocorticoids and insulin. Although Fru-2,6-P2 plays a key role in the regulation of carbon flux in the gluconeogenic pathway, the regulation of this flux depends on several factors and regulation of other key enzymes whose importance varies depending on the dietary and hormonal status of the animal. Molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase has elucidated its structure and permitted analysis of its evolutionary origin as well as its tissue distribution and control of its gene expression. The rat liver and skeletal muscle isoforms arose by alternative splicing of a single gene. The muscle form differs from the liver form only at the NH2-terminal and does not have a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site. The hepatic enzyme subunit consists of 470 amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ten families have been identified in which one or more members have single-point mutations in their insulin genes that result in amino acid substitutions within the proinsulin molecule. Six of these cause the secretion of biologically defective insulin molecules due to changes within the A or B chains. Replacing A3-Val with Leu, B24-Phe with Ser, or B25-Phe with Leu results in molecules that have essentially normal immunoreactivity but greatly reduced insulin-receptor-binding potency. Individuals with these mutations have a syndrome of mild diabetes or glucose intolerance, which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant mode and is associated with hyperinsulinemia and altered insulin-C-peptide ratios. Although affected individuals are heterozygous and coexpress both normal and abnormal molecules, the elevated circulating insulin consists mainly of the biologically defective form, which accumulates because it fails to be rapidly metabolized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Four additional families have mutations that are associated with relatively asymptomatic hyperproinsulinemia. A point mutation affecting proinsulin occurs in 3 of the 4 families, leading to replacement of Arg-65 by His, which prevents recognition of the C-peptide-A-chain dibasic cleavage site by the appropriate beta-cell processing protease and results in the circulation of a type II proinsulin intermediate form (des 64, 65 HPI). Members of a fourth family with hyperproinsulinemia have a substitution of B10-His with Asp, resulting in a proinsulin that exhibits markedly altered subcellular sorting behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes in humans, a considerable body of evidence has accumulated indicating that a chronic physiological increment in the plasma glucose concentration leads to progressive impairment in insulin secretion and may contribute to insulin resistance as well. The precise biochemical mechanism(s) responsible for the hyperglycemia-induced defect in insulin secretion remains to be defined but may be related to a defect in phosphoinositide metabolism. In animal models of diabetes, development of insulin resistance is related to downregulation of the glucose-transport system, and a similar phenomenon is also likely to occur in humans. In addition, hyperglycemia in humans may lead to a defect in glycogen synthesis. In this respect, humans may be different from rats. In type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients who are poorly controlled, insulin resistance is a characteristic feature and can be ameliorated by tight glycemic control, suggesting that hyperglycemia is responsible for the insulin resistance. Evidence also has accumulated to implicate glucose toxicity in the functional impairment in insulin secretion that occurs during the initial presentation of patients with type I diabetes, and this may explain the honeymoon period so commonly observed after the institution of insulin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Many clinical studies have shown an increased insulin response to oral glucose in patients with ischemia of the heart, lower limbs, or brain. Hyperinsulinemia also occurs in patients with angiographically proved atherosclerosis without ischemia and thus appears to be related to arterial disease and not to be a nonspecific response to tissue injury. Fasting insulin levels and insulin responses to intravenous stimuli, including glucose, tolbutamide, and arginine, are normal, suggesting a gastrointestinal factor may be involved in the increased insulin response to oral glucose. In patients with atherosclerosis, insulin sensitivity appears to be normal or enhanced with respect to both glucose and lipid metabolism. Five population studies have shown that insulin responses to glucose are higher in populations at greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Many of the hyperinsulinemic populations also had upper-body obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and hypertension. These prospective studies support an independent association between hyperinsulinemia and ischemic heart disease, although their results differ in detail. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with raised triglyceride and decreased HDL cholesterol levels. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is less closely related to hyperinsulinemia. Upper-body adiposity is associated (in separate studies) with coronary heart disease, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin and blood pressure are closely related in both normotensive and hypertensive people. Although obesity and diabetes are often found in hypertensive people, hyperinsulinemia also occurs in nonobese nondiabetic hypertensive people. Thus, hyperinsulinemia is closely associated with a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, i.e., hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL levels, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and upper-body obesity. There is a possibility that insulin has a role in the sex differences in ischemic heart disease incidence and their absence in diabetes, but additional work is required for its clarification. Long-term treatment with insulin results in lipid-containing lesions and thickening of the arterial wall in experimental animals. Insulin also inhibits regression of diet-induced experimental atherosclerosis, and insulin deficiency inhibits the development of arterial lesions. Insulin stimulates lipid synthesis in arterial tissue; the effect of insulin is influenced by hemodynamic factors and may be localized to certain parts of the artery. In physiological concentrations, insulin stimulates proliferation and migration of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells but has no effort on endothelial cells cultured from large vessels. Insulin also stimulates cholesterol synthesis and LDL binding in both arterial smooth muscle cells and monocyte macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms by which various classes of extracellular signals regulate insulin secretion are discussed regarding their cellular and molecular actions. Under physiological circumstances, the small postprandial changes in plasma glucose concentrations (approximately 4.4-6.6 mM) primarily serve as a conditioned modifier of insulin secretion and dramatically alter the responsiveness of islets to a combination of neurohormonal agonists. These agonists have two functions. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and acetylcholine activate the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike peptide 1 activate adenylate cyclase. These two functional classes of neurohumoral agonists act synergistically to enhance insulin secretion when plasma glucose is greater than 6.0 mM but not when it is less than or equal to 4 mM. On the other hand, an increase in plasma glucose concentration to 8-10 mM induces an increase in insulin secretory rate in the absence of any of the neurohormonal agonists. Remarkably, high glucose leads to an increase in the same intracellular signals, as does a combination of acetylcholine and GIP. On the basis of these data, a model of how insulin secretion is regulated under physiological circumstances is proposed. This model emphasizes that the regulation of insulin secretion occurs in three stages: cephalic, early enteric, and later enteric. In this view, the crucial event occurring during the first two phases is the agonist-induced, translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the plasma membrane under conditions in which an increase in Ca2+ influx does not occur. PKC is now in a cellular location and a Ca2(+)-sensitive conformation such that an increase in Ca2+ influx rate occurring during the third phase leads to its immediate activation and an enhanced rate of insulin secretion. Furthermore, under physiological circumstances, an optimal insulin secretory response is dependent on a correct temporal pattern of signals arising from neural and enteric sources. If this pattern is deranged, an abnormal pattern of insulin secretion is observed. An important new insight is provided by the observation that agonists (e.g., CCK or acetylcholine) that act to stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositides, when acting for a short period (10-20 min), induce an enhanced responsiveness of islets to glucose, i.e., proemial sensitization. However, when acting unopposed for several hours, these agonists will induce a time-dependent suppression of responsiveness to glucose and other agonists. The latter observation implies that optimal insulin secretion is dependent on periodic rather than a continuous exposure to the correct pattern of extracellular signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Combination sulfonylurea-insulin therapy for patients with diabetes mellitus has been evaluated by numerous investigators with various experimental designs. Much of the data are conflicting, and clear conclusions do not seem justified. Insulin-sulfonylurea therapy is probably not clinically useful in most patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Most non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients are also unlikely to have meaningful improvement in glycemic regulation on insulin-sulfonylurea therapy. A subset of NIDDM patients who are mildly to moderately obese, have adequate endogenous insulin secretory reserve, and are in poor glycemic regulation (fasting plasma glucose greater than 11 mM and/or HbA1 greater than 10%), despite twice-daily insulin administration of greater than 70 U/day, may show significant improvement of glycemic regulation and/or decreases in insulin daily dose on insulin-sulfonylurea therapy. The mechanisms by which insulin-sulfonylurea therapy improves glycemic regulation and decreases insulin requirements involve an increase in endogenous insulin secretion and possibly some extrapancreatic actions of the sulfonylureas on muscle and liver.\r"

This concept dates back to the earliest use of sustained-action insulin and has a rationale strengthened by recent physiological insights. Specifically, the predominance of fasting over postprandial hypoglycemia and occurrence of the dawn phenomenon in NIDDM argue for carefully timed overnight delivery of insulin. High nocturnal concentrations of free fatty acids in NIDDM may contribute to hepatic insensitivity to insulin and fasting hyperglycemia and can be suppressed by evening insulin. Although several clinical studies suggest that evening insulin regimens are safe and effective, their role in clinical practice is not yet established. Further study of this approach may clarify not only its proper use but also the best use of conventional strategies.\r"

  ".W": "Combination therapy for type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus with insulin and sulfonylureas has been a topic of interest since the latter were introduced to clinical use. In recent years, improved understanding of potential complications associated with hyperinsulinemia has led to resurgent interest in alternatives to insulin monotherapy for patients who have failed on a regimen of diet and sulfonylureas. A plethora of clinical trials have reported on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic agents in limiting insulin requirements while achieving glycemic control in this subset of diabetic patients. However, few studies have been appropriate in both design and duration to provide convincing results. The randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials that have used a parallel design and study periods of up to 1 yr have uniformly investigated second-generation sulfonylureas and yielded the most reliable information. In all instances, the combination regimen achieved reduction in insulin requirement with varying evidence of a pancreatic effect as the responsible mechanism. This treatment modality is becoming more widely accepted in the effort to achieve optimal glycemic control with minimum risk to the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Metformin is a hypoglycemic drug effective in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and increasingly used in Canada and Europe. Effects on intestinal glucose absorption, insulin secretion, and hepatic glucose production are insufficient to explain its hypoglycemic action, with most evidence suggesting that the major effect of the drug is on glucose utilization. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that metformin stimulates the insulin-induced component of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipocytes in both diabetic individuals and animal models. This increase is more significant in diabetic than in nondiabetic animals, suggesting an enhanced action of the drug in the hyperglycemic state. The increase in glucose uptake is also reflected in an increase in the insulin-dependent portion of glucose oxidation. Potential sites of action of metformin are the insulin receptor and the glucose transporters. Although metformin increases insulin binding in various cell types, this effect is not universal and does not correlate with stimulation of glucose utilization. In contrast, direct effects of the drug on the glucose-transport system have been demonstrated. Metformin elevates the uptake of nonmetabolizable analogues of glucose in both nondiabetic rat adipocytes and diabetic mouse muscle. In the latter, the stimulatory effect of the drug is additive to that of insulin. In human and rat muscle cells in culture, metformin increases glucose-analogue transport independently of and additive to insulin, suggesting an insulin-dependent action. Most of these results suggest that the basis for the hypoglycemic effect of this biguanide is probably at the level of skeletal muscle by increasing glucose transport across the cell membrane.\r"

Supplementation with T-laden microspheres maintained testicular interstitial fluid T at concentrations not different from controls without elevation of serum T concentrations. All other values, including fertility were suppressed by GnRH-antagonist treatment and maintained by supplementation with T-laden microspheres.\r"

There were significant increases in cases with a history of sexually transmitted diseases (from 19.1% to 31.6%) and in recurrent EPs (7.6% to 19.0%) but declines in EP associated with contraceptive failures. Newer diagnostic techniques such as quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin assays, pelvic ultrasound, and laparoscopy were more frequently used in the 1980 to 1984 period, resulting in less severe morbidity on admission, more conservative surgical management, and reduced length of hospitalization. Thus, although admissions for EP have increased, the severity of illness has been reduced by earlier diagnosis and more conservative management.\r"

Follow-up included serial assays of the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), clinical and sonographic evaluation. Resolution was obtained in 13 out of 17 patients. The regression curve between days after treatment versus beta-hCG (y = 82.2 - 10.8x + 0.37x2) demonstrated a significant negative correlation (R2 = 0.77; R = 0.88; P less than or equal to 0.02). The mean beta-hCG level on day 15 was 3.2% +/- 3.1% of the initial value. Laparoscopy was performed in 4 patients. Pathological findings suggested that resolution was underway in these four cases despite a slow decline in beta-hCG. No systemic side effects were observed in any of the 17 patients. Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate tubal patency and reproductive outcome. Our experience suggests that local injection of MTX may be an effective alternative for the treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Average daily doses of captopril and minoxidil were 269 mg (range 150 to 300) and 20 mg (range 7.5 to 30), respectively. At the end of the 6 months' treatment, blood pressure had dropped significantly in both groups, but echocardiographic criteria of hypertrophy improved only in the captopril group (intragroup comparison): blood pressure, thickness of the intraventricular septum and posterior wall, and the left ventricular mass index, respectively, decreased from 163/102 to 135/89 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), 17.4 to 15.9 mm (p less than 0.05), 14.5 to 13.4 mm (p less than 0.05) and 236 to 198 g/m2 (p less than 0.001). In the minoxidil group, blood pressure dropped from 160/99 to 137/87 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), but echocardiographic criteria were not significantly modified. Fractional shortening remained normal in both groups. These results show that in patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, captopril-based triple therapy reduces left ventricular mass without altering systolic performance, whereas minoxidil-based therapy does not.\r"

Luminal areas determined with ultrasound imaging correlated well with those calculated from microscopic slides (r = 0.98). Three patterns were identified on the ultrasound images: 1) distinct interface between media and adventitia, 2) indistinct interface between media and adventitia but different echo density layers, and 3) diffuse homogeneous appearance. The types of patterns depended on the relative composition of the media and adventitia. Calcification of intimal plaque obscured underlying structures.

Peak velocity during early ventricular filling (VE) and during atrial systole (VA) and diastolic velocity-time integral of early (IE) and late (IA) ventricular filling caused by atrial contraction were measured. The ratios of VE/VA and IE/IA were also calculated. Diastolic peak velocities, as well as the diastolic velocity-time integral of early and late ventricular filling measured through the mitral valve were significantly higher during inspiration. The peak of the wave representing the velocity during atrial systole (A) was always higher than the peak of the wave representing the velocity of early ventricular filling (E). As a result, the ratio of these two variables (E/A) was always less than 1, showing no significant variation from inspiration to expiration. The flow patterns into the right ventricle were the opposite of those observed through the mitral valve. During inspiration, a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in peak and time integral velocities of both the early ventricular filling and atrial systole waves was observed. Heart rate did not vary with respiration. It is concluded that during positive pressure ventilation, inspiration decreases right ventricular filling and enhances left ventricular filling. Opposite changes are recorded during expiration. Early and late phases of diastolic filling are equally affected. These changes are different from those observed during spontaneous breathing and should be taken into account in the assessment of diastolic ventricular function in preterm infants requiring assisted ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "To delineate the determinants of right ventricular performance with acute right ventricular dysfunction, surgical electrical isolation of the right ventricular free wall was produced in 13 dogs. During atrioventricular (AV) pacing, hemodynamic and wall motion measurements were normal. When not paced, the right ventricular free wall became asystolic, resulting in a depressed and bifid right ventricular systolic pressure (33 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 4 mm Hg) and decreased left ventricular systolic pressure (100 +/- 18 to 80 +/- 18 mm Hg) and stroke volume (14 +/- 4 to 10.3 +/- 3.5 ml) (all p less than 0.05). Ultrasound demonstrated right ventricular free wall dyskinesia, increased right ventricular end-diastolic size (155 +/- 13% of control), but decreased left ventricular size (69 +/- 11% of control) (both p less than 0.05). Right atrial pressure increased (5.8 +/- 2.5 to 7.6 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) with an augmented A wave and blunted Y descent, indicating pandiastolic right ventricular dysfunction. The septum demonstrated reversed curvature in diastole and bulged paradoxically into the right ventricle during early systole, generating the initial peak of right ventricular pressure and reducing its volume. Later, posterior septal motion coincided with maximal left ventricular pressure and the second peak of the right ventricular waveform. Left ventricular pacing alone led to further decreases in right ventricular systolic pressure and size, left ventricular systolic pressure and stroke volume. The previously augmented A wave was replaced by a prominent V wave. Therefore, when contractility of its free wall is acutely depressed, right ventricular performance is dependent on left ventricular-septal contractile contributions transmitted by the septum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, available data suggest that only 10% of patients with acute infarction in the United States receive thrombolytic drugs. Given the benefits of thrombolytic therapy, all patients with myocardial infarction would likely be treated were it not for associated risks. Several groups exist in which the risk/benefit ratio of thrombolytic therapy continues to be controversial, including those with inferior infarction, absence of ST segment elevation or presentation greater than 6 h from symptom onset, elderly patients and those with hypertension. Three recent thrombolytic trials reported a reduction in mortality that was entirely independent of infarct location. Pooled data from trials involving 12,000 patients with inferior infarction have demonstrated a reduction in mortality rate (6.8% versus 8.7%, p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, improvement in regional and global left ventricular function occurred after reperfusion therapy of inferior infarction. Pooled data indicate that patients treated between 6 and 24 h after symptom onset have a lower mortality rate than do those who receive placebo (11.1% versus 13.1%, p less than 0.001). Improved survival occurs after thrombolytic therapy in patients with ST segment elevation or left bundle branch block, but not in those with isolated ST depression or a normal electrocardiogram. Age should not be considered an absolute contraindication because the lifesaving potential of thrombolytic therapy in the elderly may be two to three times that of the overall group of patients with myocardial infarction. Finally, recent studies demonstrated that patients who present with hypotension or hypertension or who have undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation may also benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These nef-specific CTL recognized a synthetic peptide of 10 residues derived from a nonamphipathic, highly conserved region of the nef protein in association with the HLA A3.1 molecule. Using human cell transfectants expressing mutations of the A3 molecule, we demonstrated that the amino acid at position 152 of the A3.1 molecule appears to be critical for detection of this response. Thus, rapid analysis of the epitopes of HIV proteins stimulating CTL responses can be achieved using a combination of fresh donor PBMC and target cells pulsed with synthesized peptides.\r"

  ".U": "90293451\r", 
  ".W": "An in vitro model of T cell adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and transendothelial migration was used to determine whether the activation state of the T cell or cytokine exposure of the HUVEC altered T cell-HUVEC interactions or receptor utilization. Stimulation of T cells with the activator of protein kinase C, phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) alone or in combination with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin increased their binding to HUVEC. Much of the binding of control and activated T cells to HUVEC was mediated by leukocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18), because mAb to either chain of this molecule inhibited binding substantially, but not completely. Activation of HUVEC with IL-1 also increased binding of T cells. Binding of control T cells to IL-1-stimulated HUVEC, however, was found to be LFA-1 independent, because mAb to CD11a/CD18 failed to block the interaction. In contrast, binding of activated T cells to IL-1-stimulated HUVEC was partially inhibited by mAb to LFA-1. Binding of activated T cells to IL-1-stimulated HUVEC also involved CD44 because this interaction was partially blocked by mAb to this determinant. When T cell migration was analyzed, it was found that the migration of PDB-activated T cells was three to four-fold more than that of control T cells. Migration through HUVEC and random migration were both enhanced by PDB stimulation. However, when the T cells were costimulated with PDB and ionomycin, migration was not increased above that of control T cells. PDB-activated T cells appeared to use LFA-1 for migration regardless of the activation status of the HUVEC, because mAb to CD11a/CD18 partially blocked their migration after binding to HUVEC. There was also a modest inhibition of PDB-activated T cell migration by mAb to CD44. In contrast, migration of control T cells involved neither LFA-1 nor CD44. Finally, binding of control T cells to high endothelial venules of peripheral lymphoid tissue was found to be CD11a/CD18 and CD44 independent, and completely inhibited by activation with either PDB or the combination of PDB and ionomycin. These results demonstrate that T cells use LFA-1 and CD44 as well as other as yet unidentified adhesion receptors for interactions with HUVEC, and that use of these adhesion receptors is mutable and related to the activation state of the T cell and cytokine stimulation of the HUVEC.\r"

  ".W": "IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF are hemopoietic growth factors involved in monocytopoiesis and functional stimulation of circulating blood monocytes. We demonstrate that both cytokines enhance the adhesion of purified human monocytes to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and to plastic surfaces. The stimulation seen was biphasic: an early phase detectable by 10 min, and a late phase seen after 9 h of in vitro culture. IL-3- and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF-stimulated adhesion was seen at concentrations as low as 6 pM, with maximal monocyte adhesion of up to 60% seen at concentrations of 60 pM and above. Both phases of stimulated adhesion were partially inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CD18, the common beta-chain of the leukocyte functional Ag family of adhesion molecules, but not by an antibody to CD11b, the alpha-chain of MAC-1. However, a difference in the mechanism by which the early and late phases of stimulated adhesion arise could be shown by the use of cycloheximide as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Although the late phase was totally dependent on de novo protein synthesis, early phase adhesion was not inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting receptor redistribution or conformational change as the mechanism mediating enhanced adhesion at this time. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease and may have implications for the clinical use of these cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "The Lewis Y Ag is a carbohydrate Ag which is closely related to a well-known murine embryonic Ag, the stage-specific embryonic Ag-1 (SSEA-1), in its biochemical structure. It is expressed at the surface of murine embryonic cells as well as many murine cancer cells. For the analysis of idiotopes carried by the anti-Lewis Y antibodies, we generated two syngenic anti-idiotypic mAb, Id-A1 and Id-B4 (both BALB/c IgG1), which are directed to the idiotypic determinants carried by the anti-Lewis Y mAb, AH-6 (BALB/c IgM). Both Id-A1 and Id-B4 (Ab2) recognized paratope-related idiotopes carried by the AH-6 antibody (Ab1); they specifically inhibited the binding of AH-6 to the Lewis Y Ag. The high idiotypic connectivity of anti-Lewis Y antibodies was noted; the polyclonal anti-idiotype antibody, produced in the sera of BALB/c mice by immunizing AH-6 antibody, cross-reacted with several anti-Lewis Y mAb which has been established in different laboratories. Id-B4 and Id-A1 seem to represent such cross-reactive anti-idiotypic antibodies. Id-A1 recognized an idiotope carried by two out of six panel Ab1 mAb directed to the Lewis Y Ag. Id-B4 reacted with four out of the six panel antibodies, and was considered to recognize a recurrent idiotope of anti-Lewis Y antibodies which occurs more commonly than the idiotope recognized by Id-A1. All of the anti-Lewis Y antibodies which carry idiotopes that react with Id-A1 or Id-B4 were encoded by the VH genes of the VH7183 family; the most D-J proximal VH gene family in BALB/c mice, which is known to be preferentially expressed in embryonic B cells. Immunization of BALB/c mice with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Id-B4 and/or Id-A1 induced a significant titer of anti-Lewis Y antibodies (Ab1-like Ab3) in the sera.\r"

  ".W": "Sporozoites and merozoites are stages in the life cycle of Cryptosporidium parvum that can cyclically infect intestinal cells, causing persistent infection and severe diarrhea in immunodeficient patients. Infection by sporozoites can be neutralized by surface-reactive mAb. We show that merozoite infectivity can also be neutralized by surface-reactive mAb. To do this, viable C. parvum merozoites were isolated by differential and isopycnic. centrifugation, and distinguished from sporozoites by transmission electron microscopy. Differential reactivity with a panel of seven mAb was used to determine the amount of sporozoite contamination in isolated merozoite preparations. The isolated merozoites were distinguished from sporozoites (p less than 0.0001) by four sporozoite-specific mAb (16.332, 16.502, 17.25, and 18.357) in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Three mAb (16.29, 17.41, and 18.44) consistently reacted with both merozoites and sporozoites. Isolated merozoites were infectious for neonatal mice when administered by intraintestinal injection. Infectivity for mice was significantly neutralized (p less than 0.05) when 1 to 2 x 10(5) merozoites were incubated with sporozoite-neutralizing mAb 17.41 or 18.44, before inoculation. Merozoites incubated with an isotype control mAb remained infectious for neonatal mice. We conclude that C. parvum merozoites share neutralization-sensitive epitopes with sporozoites.\r"

We have found increased levels of IL-6 in the sera from MH134 hepatoma- and CSA1M fibrosarcoma-bearing mice. Concerning the capacity of these tumor cells themselves to produce IL-6 in vitro, they exhibited the distinct contrast, i.e., the MH134 tumor cells produced high levels of IL-6 whereas the CSA1M generated a marginal level of IL-6. It was, however, demonstrated that appreciably enhanced IL-6 production was observed in spleen cell culture supernatants from both types of tumor-bearing mice when compared to those obtained from normal mice. More importantly, in contrast to the production of IL-6 by non-T cell compartment of normal spleen cells, enhanced IL-6 production of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice was ascribed to T cell compartment. Analysis of T cell phenotype has revealed that enhanced IL-6 production was mediated predominantly by Lyt-2+ but not by L3T4+ T cell subset. Thus, these results indicate that increased circulating IL-6 is elicited in the tumor-bearing state and that irrespective of the potential of tumor cells themselves to produce IL-6, T cells, especially Lyt-2+ T cells from tumor-bearing mice are responsible for such a high level of IL-6 production.\r"

To assess analgesia requirements during single-follicle aspiration, a double-blind study was set up in 30 patients comparing intraprocedure intravenous fentanyl with normal saline as a placebo. Analysis of pain perception using visual analogue scoring showed a similar pain tolerance in both groups for the procedures of vaginal ultrasound scanning, needle insertion, and follicular aspiration. A correlation between each patient's tolerance of common pain-producing experiences with that for the procedure was not well defined (r = 0.5). We conclude that one of the benefits of natural-cycle IVF using transvaginal single-follicle aspiration is that it can be performed without analgesia.\r"

(1) FF temperature is lower than ovarian stroma and body temperatures. The physiological significance of this gradient is unknown. (2) Follicular size increases exponentially prior to ovulation. The relationship between FF volume and successful IVF outcome is well established. (3) A highly significant association exists between fertilization (but not embryo cleavage) and FF spectrophotometric absorbance at delta optic density of 455 nm. (4) FF behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid--its viscosity changes at different shear rates. Neither FF viscosity nor its refractive index was found to correlate with the presence of oocytes, their maturation grade, or their fertilizing capacity. (5) FF osmolarity is similar to that of the plasma. There is no information linking variations in FF osmolarity to IVF outcome. (6) FF pH is acidic, probably due to acid mucopolysaccharides. It appears that the intact follicle is capable of buffering any carbon dioxide which diffuses through its wall at the time of intraperitoneal insufflation. The transvaginal aspiration technique eliminates any possible effect of exogenous gas on FF pH. (7) Regarding the intact follicle, it was shown that (a) there is a small potential difference across the follicle wall, and (b) intrafollicular pressure remains steady prior to ovulation. This information may shed some light on mechanisms underlying FF formation and ovulation. No experiments relating these properties to IVF outcome have been performed.\r"

  ".W": "The results of treatment of 171 children with stage I-II Hodgkin's disease from two institutions with differing approaches to management have been analyzed. At the Stanford University Medical Center/Children's Hospital at Stanford (SUMC/CHaS), pathologic staging followed by extended-field radiation alone or involved-field radiation plus combination chemotherapy have been cardinal to the management policy. At St Bartholomew's Hospital/The Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street (Barts/GOS), clinical staging only has been used over the last 10 years, and involved/regional-field radiotherapy used as the treatment of choice rather than extended-field radiotherapy. Some children at each institution received combined modality therapy as primary management. Relapse among children with stage I disease was a more frequent occurrence in the Barts/GOS series than in the SUMC/CHaS group. However, the survival rates from the two centers are identical, 91% at 10 years. The following scientific-philosophic question is asked: Should one maximally stage and treat all children to increase the likelihood of a high freedom from relapse (FFR; cure) rate, or is it acceptable to minimize the initial staging and treatment, realizing that a proportion of patients will fail and require salvage/rescue therapy? With the awareness of morbidity from pathologic staging and aggressive treatment, and the favorable survival data reported from specialized centers using differing approaches, treatment strategies should be directed toward the long-term goal of cure of disease with maximal quality of life. A multidisciplinary management philosophy undertaken at a center with extensive experience in pediatric Hodgkin's disease is important to achieving this goal.\r"

Between April 1972 and May 1980, 462 patients with HD clinical stage (CS) I, II, and III were prospectively treated with three or six cycles of MOPP and supra- and/or infradiaphragmatic irradiation (40 Gy). Four hundred forty-one patients achieved complete remission (CR). By January 1988, 237 patients had been followed-up in first CR for at least 10 years. Ten patients developed SANLL between the 34th and 123rd month of CR. The 15-year SANLL risk is 3.5% +/- 2.7%. Cox's stepwise regression analysis performed with all initial and treatment covariates (sex, age, histology, splenectomy, MOPP chemotherapy, and irradiation extent) showed that the only significant explanatory variable of SANLL risk was the irradiation extent (P less than .002). Using the log-rank test, SANLL risk ranged from 2.2% for supradiaphragmatic irradiation alone to 9.1% for subtotal (STNI) or total nodal irradiation (TNI) (P less than .001). These results strongly suggest that extended high-dose irradiation and MOPP chemotherapy should not be combined for the treatment of HD.\r"

Patients were stratified by estimated bone marrow reserve, and impaired marrow reserve patients received reduced doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. The complete remission rate for normal marrow reserve patients was 65%, while the complete remission rate for impaired marrow reserve patients was 29%. With a median follow-up period of 41 months, 64% of complete responders in the normal marrow group are disease-free 3 years after their response. Three-year survival is 61% in the normal marrow reserve group and is 29% in the impaired marrow reserve group. Eighty-seven percent of treatment courses were given in accordance with protocol dosing and schedule. For doxorubicin, relative dose intensities were 0.75 and 0.61 (normal and impaired marrow reserve arms, respectively), for cyclophosphamide, 0.76 and 0.61, and for methotrexate, 0.55 and 0.45. Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level was the only pretreatment characteristic found to have a significant effect on overall survival. Severe or greater toxicity occurred in 97% and 89% of the normal and impaired marrow reserve groups, respectively, with granulocytopenia the principal toxicity. Treatment-related fatalities occurred in 8% of patients. m-BACOD is an effective but toxic treatment program for intermediate- and high-grade malignant lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized trial has been performed in which women with axillary node-positive breast cancer were allocated to either a short intensive 12-week chemohormonal treatment consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, prednisone, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and tamoxifen (CMFVP plus AT) or 36 weeks of CMFVP. The median follow-up is 37 months. Of the 222 women randomized to the 12-week treatment, 113 (50.9%) have experienced either recurrence or death as compared with 90 patients (41.9%) in the 36-week treatment group. The corresponding 3-year relapse-free survivals are 55% and 64%, respectively, P = .003. Fifty-nine (26.6%) of the patients in the 12-week group have died compared with 46 (21.4%) of the 36-week group. The corresponding 3-year survival rates are 78% and 85%, respectively, P = .04. A Cox regression analysis showed an associated increased risk ratio for recurrence or death of 1.7, P = .003, and for death of 1.8, P = .017 in the 12-week treatment group compared with the 36-week group. Thus, this 12-week regimen of adjuvant chemohormonal therapy is inadequate treatment for women with axillary node-positive breast cancer; possible explanations for this inferiority are its shorter duration and/or a negative interaction of tamoxifen on the chemotherapy.\r"

Twenty patients with a history of completely resected CEA-producing adenocarcinoma (18 with colon cancer, one with breast cancer, and one with Hodgkin's disease) and a rising serum CEA level were given an intravenous infusion of 2 mg of 111In-labeled ZCE-025 mixed with 38 mg of unlabeled ZCE-025. Planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scans were acquired at 72 and 144 hours, and in 19 of the 20 patients these were positive. Of those 19, 13 underwent exploratory surgery, and cancer was found in 10, and two had a diagnostic biopsy, which confirmed cancer. Three patients who had negative laparotomies and all four patients who did not undergo surgery or biopsy were followed radiologically. In all seven, cancer was subsequently detected at the sites suggested by the ZCE-025 scan. Thus, tumor was confirmed in all 19 patients with positive scans. Five of 13 patients who were explored benefited from the study and the exploratory laparotomy, as disease was entirely resected in four or was subjected to definitive radiation therapy to the pelvis in the fifth. In two additional patients who were not explored, MoAb imaging resulted in definitive therapy to regionally confined recurrent disease. 111In-labeled anti-CEA MoAb ZCE-025 scanning in patients with rising CEA successfully imaged metastatic colorectal cancer that eluded detection by other methods and affected the care given to some. These results suggest an important role for 111In-labeled ZCE-025 scanning among patients with rising CEA and otherwise occult metastatic cancer.\r"

Rats were trained to discriminate NMDA (40 mg/kg) from saline. The DS effects of NMDA were blocked by the competitive NMDA antagonists but were antagonized at best partially by the other drugs tested. The response rate decreasing effects of NMDA were attenuated to varied extents by both the competitive and the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists. Some competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists partially mimicked NMDA. To further examine their NMDA-antagonist properties, the compounds were also tested for antagonism of NMDA (160 mg/kg)-induced lethality in mice; only the competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists completely protected against NMDA-induced lethality. In rats discriminating PCP (2.5 mg/kg) from saline, the competitive NMDA antagonists produced less drug-appropriate responding than the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists but more than was produced by the other drugs tested. The extent to which compounds antagonize behavioral effects of NMDA and produce PCP-like DS effects may depend partly on the effect measured and on the component of the NMDA receptor complex with which they interact. Although the competitive NMDA antagonists were more effective in blocking NMDA than the other drugs tested, they failed to act as pure antagonists of the DS effects of NMDA.\r"

Preincubation with neurotensin or phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate decreased the number of cell surface neurotensin receptors and neurotensin-induced increases of inositol trisphosphates and [Ca2+]i. The phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate-(43 +/- 1% at 1 microM) but not the neurotensin (65 +/- 9% at 10 nM)-induced decrease in receptors was blocked by staurosporine. The decrease in cell surface receptors was accompanied by a 55 +/- 7% shift of specifically bound 125I-neurotensin from the plasma membrane fraction to the light vesicle fraction of sucrose density gradients if a 37 degrees C incubation step was included. The time course for desensitization of [Ca2+]i mobilization was more rapid (maximal at approximately 1 min) than for loss of receptors (maximal at 45 min). After a 5-min exposure to neurotensin, the cell surface receptor number rapidly returned to control levels in the absence of agonist, but [Ca2+]i sensitivity to neurotensin recovered only partially. Incubation with carbachol, ATP or phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate desensitized the subsequent [Ca2+]i response to neurotensin. These results demonstrate a polyphosphoinositide-[Ca2+]i pathway in HT29 cells stimulable by neurotensin and other agents. The results from pre-incubation studies indicate that the neurotensin receptor-signaling pathway is homologously and heterologously regulated. Finally, differences in time courses for loss and recovery of cell surface receptors and desensitization of the [Ca2+]i response, as well as the lack of effect on 125I-neurotensin binding of other agonists that desensitize the neurotensin [Ca2+]i response, suggest that receptor internalization alone does not account for desensitization of the system.\r"

We investigated ethacizin block of INa in 11 cells and ethmozin block in 4 cells at 20 degrees C. Rest block measured as the relative INa decrease for the first pulse in drug after 3 to 6 min at the holding potential was negligible for ethacizin but substantial (16% at 5 microM) for ethmozin. Use-dependent block developed exponentially; the time course of block and relative INa remaining were concentration-dependent. Frequency dependence of block between 0.5 and 4 cps was weak for ethacizin. Varying the depolarization duration from 5 to 100 msec, while keeping the recovery interval constant, did not alter the block by ethacizin. In contrast, prolonging the clamp step in ethmozin from 5 to 100 msec increased the rate and depth of block. Apparent binding rates for each drug were calculated using the assumptions of the guarded receptor model. We conclude that ethacizin blocks INa in a use-dependent manner by binding to a transiently available state such as the open state. In contrast, ethmozin block of INa exhibits both rest block and use-dependent block. Use-dependent block can be attributed to binding to a state (or states) maintained during depolarization such as the inactivated state. With these similar drugs, charge appears to be an important determinant of state-dependent binding.\r"

ET-1, 0.1 to 1 nmol/kg i.v., decreased or elicited biphasic changes in arterial pressure (AP), whereas ET-3, in the same doses, decreased AP. Both ETs increased cardiac output (CO) and, at the highest doses, a secondary decrease in CO was observed. NPY, 0.3 to 3 nmol/kg i.v., increased AP and at the highest dose decreased CO. All three peptides had inconsistent effects on right ventricular contractile force and increased central venous pressure. ET-1 at lower doses increased heart rate (HR) and, at 1 nmol/kg, caused a biphasic change. ET-3 increased HR, whereas NPY decreased HR. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was increased by NPY and decreased by ET-3, whereas ET-1 elicited biphasic changes. ET-1 and ET-3 increased pulmonary arterial pressure, left atrial pressure and caused biphasic changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). NPY had no significant effect on PAP or PVR. When pulmonary blood flow was maintained constant, ET-1 and ET-3 had only pulmonary vasoconstrictor activity, whereas NPY and the ET analog had no significant effect. The increase in SVR in response to NPY, the decrease in response to ET-3 or the biphasic change in response to ET-1 were not modified by meclofenamate, hexamethonium or propranolol. Increases in HR in response to ET-1 and ET-3 were reduced by the beta receptor and ganglionic blocking agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NMDA-stimulated [3H]NE release was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, Mg++ and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, indicating that NMDA receptors in the cortex have characteristics similar to those observed using electrophysiological studies. Ethanol (60-200 mM) decreased the release of [3H]NE evoked by 100 microM NMDA in a concentration-dependent manner (32-52% inhibition), but it did not significantly alter the basal release. The inhibitory effect of 100 mM ethanol was due to a reduction in the maximal response with no significant change in the EC50 for NMDA. Pretreatment of the slices with 100 mM ethanol up to 6 min did not alter the magnitude of inhibition. The inhibition of NMDA-stimulated [3H]NE release due to ethanol was reversible after a 13-min recovery period. The presence of ethanol did not significantly affect the IC50 for Mg++ inhibition of NMDA-stimulated [3H]NE release (23 +/- 3 microM). Glycine (10-300 microM) potentiated the release of [3H]NE stimulated by 250 microM NMDA, and 60 mM ethanol did not alter this effect of glycine. Ethanol (100 mM) inhibited the release of [3H]NE evoked by 18.9 mM KCl in the presence or absence of 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, but had no effect on release induced by 49.1 mM KCl. Tetrodotoxin (0.3 mM) significantly decreased the release of [3H] NE evoked by 23.2 mM KCl, and 60 to 200 mM ethanol did not alter this release. These results suggest that NMDA receptors in rat cortical slices are located on nerve cell bodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chemically induced hypoglycemia and anoxia were evaluated in embryonic day 13 chicken retina to determine if excitotoxicity was a consequence of these conditions and if this was preceded by the net release of glutamate or aspartate. Retina incubated with iodoacetate (IOA), to inhibit glycolysis, or potassium cyanide (KCN), to inhibit electron transport, produced histological lesions similar to those found with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or kainate. An increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid release, which has been used previously as a marker of excitatory amino acid-induced acute excitotoxicity, was also found to occur with IOA or KCN treatment. The NMDA antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and MK-801 [(+)-11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten,5,10-imine maleate] protected retina from IOA- or KCN-induced lesioning and prevented the increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid release. The non-NMDA glutamate antagonist, 6-nitro,7-cyano-quinoxaline,2,3-dion, had little effect suggesting that the damage was mediated predominantly by the NMDA receptor. Extracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations remained low (less than 0.2 microM) throughout incubation. Thus, the data furnish no evidence that an increase in released glutamate or aspartate is responsible for the activation of the NMDA receptor. Lactate production, ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were also measured. ATP and phosphocreatine, but not lactate, levels were correlated with the induction of an acute excitotoxic lesion. The depletion of high energy phosphates and the first appearance of acute excitotoxicity were temporally distinct. Possible mechanisms linking metabolic inhibition and NMDA receptor-mediated acute excitotoxicity are discussed.\r"

Depolarization of cells with 50 mM K+ raised [Ca++]i in all parts of the cell (e.g., soma and dendrites). [Ca++]i was also increased in these cells by GLU, kainate, quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and caffeine (CAF). Multiple challenges of a neuron with GLU gave rise to high \"plateau\" levels of [Ca++]i that were maintained over the entire length of an experiment (up to 1 hr). In the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate multiple applications of GLU only produced multiple transient increases in [Ca++]i. Multiple challenges of a cell with NMDA (0 Mg++, 1 microM glycine) also produced maintained plateau responses in [Ca++]i. Multiple challenges with kainate or quisqualate only produced multiple transient responses in [Ca++]i. Plateau responses induced by GLU or NMDA could be reversibly reduced by removal of extracellular Ca++. Co++ and Ni++ (500 microM) also reduced the magnitude of the plateau, but nitrendipine and tetrodotoxin were generally ineffective. The kinase inhibitor staurosporine also reversibly reduced the magnitude of the plateau. The initiation of a [Ca++]i plateau could be blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate although this compound was ineffective at reducing a plateau once it had formed. Thus, activation of NMDA receptors in these neurons leads to a maintained influx of Ca++ that could be responsible for certain long-term effects of GLU.\r"

Antinociception was assessed by the tail-flick test in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats and the release of immunoreactive Met-enkephalin from the spinal cord was measured by lumbar-cisternal perfusion in urethane-anesthetized rats. The sites in the brainstem most sensitive to beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) for inhibition of the tail-flick response and Met-enkephalin release were located in areas in the caudal medial medulla such as raphe obsacurus nucleus and raphe pallidus nucleus and the adjacent midline reticular formation. Sites in the rostral medial medulla were less sensitive to beta-endorphin for both antinociception and release of Met-enkephalin. The regions 1 mm and more lateral to the midline were not sensitive to beta-endorphin. The sites sensitive to morphine sulfate (4 micrograms) for antinociception were located in areas in the rostral ventromedial medulla such as raphe magnus nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus and gigantocellular reticular nucleus alpha. Raphe obscurus nucleus, which was sensitive to beta-endorphin, was not sensitive to morphine for antinociception. Locus coeruleus was sensitive to morphine and beta-endorphin for antinociception. No sites sensitive to morphine were found for Met-enkephalin release. The correlation between the brainstem sites sensitive to beta-endorphin for the production of antinociception and the release of Met-enkephalin suggests that the antinociception induced by beta-endorphin is mediated by the release of Met-enkephalin. The findings of different brainstem sites sensitive to beta-endorphin and morphine support the hypothesis of different modes of pharmacological actions for beta-endorphin and morphine.\r"

Several peptidergic neurotransmitter systems, such as the dynorphin pathways, have been shown to be distal to and regulated by the postsynaptic activity of dopaminergic pathways; therefore, we evaluated the response of extrapyramidal and limbic dynorphin A1-17 (Dyn) systems to cocaine by measuring Dyn content in associated structures. Extrapyramidal and limbic dynorphin-like immunoreactivity (DLI) content markedly increased after cocaine treatment. This change appeared to be due primarily to the ability of cocaine to block dopamine re-uptake; consequently, the increase in DLI levels was either totally or partially blocked by coadministration of selective D1 (SCH 23390) and D2 (sulpiride) receptor blockers and multiple doses of the selective dopamine uptake blockers, amfonelic acid and GBR 12909, caused cocaine-like enhancement of extrapyramidal DLI content. Serotonin did not appear to play a major role in mediating the cocaine effects on Dyn systems as multiple doses of the selective serotonin uptake blocker, fluoxetine, did not alter extrapyramidal DLI levels, and depletion of serotonin by pretreatment with parachloroamphetamine did not significantly alter the increases in extrapyramidal Dyn content caused by cocaine administration. Because the behavioral effects of cocaine and methamphetamine are similar, the neurochemical response of Dyn systems to both of these agents is compared and discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to determine what type of opioid receptor, mu or delta, in the spinal cord was involved in beta-endorphin-induced antinociception. The tail-flick response was used as an antinociceptive test. Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of ICI-174,864 [(Allyl)2-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH] (10 micrograms) or ICI-154,129 [(N,N-Bisallyl)-Tyr-Gly-Gly-psi-(CH2S)-Phe-Leu-OH] (20 micrograms), delta-opioid receptor antagonists, but not beta-funaltrexamine (0.025 microgram), a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, antagonized inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin given i.c.v. However, i.t. injection of the same dose of ICI-174,864, ICI-154,129 or beta-funaltrexamine did not affect inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by morphine given i.c.v. Mice were pretreated i.c.v. with either beta-endorphin (2 micrograms), morphine (2 micrograms) or saline (5 microliters) for 2, 3 or 4 hr (which were times that the tail-flick response was no longer inhibited) and were injected i.t. with various doses of D-Ala2-NMePhe4-Gly-ol-enkephalin (a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist), D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (a mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonist) or D-Pen2-D-Pen5-enkephalin (a delta-opioid receptor agonists). The tail-flick response was performed 10 min after i.t. injection. A single i.c.v. pretreatment with beta-endorphin for 2 and 3 hr, but not 4 hr, reduced markedly the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by D-Pen2-D-Pen5-enkephalin and D-Ala2-DLeu5-enkephalin, but not D-Ala2-NMePhe4-Gly-ol-enkephalin, injected i.t.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No complications occurred. After undergoing this procedure, 6 of 16 patients achieved pregnancy, and 13 of 14 obtained pain relief. The serum CA-125 levels were significantly decreased postoperatively. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a cone-shaped sapphire probe provides an adequate incision and lysis at low power levels and that this method is an effective treatment for ovarian endometriomas.\r"

Extrapolation of gestational age from early crown-rump lengths (CRLs) has been difficult because previously established tables of CRL versus gestational age have contained few measurements at less than seven to eight weeks from the first day of the last menses. Accordingly, the relationship between early CRL (in millimeters) and calculated menstrual age (CMA) (in days) in 36 patients with a known date of conception was studied with transvaginal sonography and found to have a linear relationship, defined by the equation CMA = 0.99 x CRL + 40.0 (r = .95, P less than .001). The relationship can be used to date pregnancies as early as 26 days after conception.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), when compared to controls, has a higher proportion of mononuclear cells actively synthesizing DNA (S-phase cells). Such cells can be marked by radioautography after incubation with tritiated thymidine and can also be quantitated by the 4-h spontaneous in vitro uptake of tritiated thymidine. As our previous studies showed a marked and rapid decrease in this latter measure, in response to in vivo methotrexate, we suggested that the responsible cells may have a direct role in pathogenesis rather than merely reflecting the inflammation that is present. We have therefore tried to characterize them further. A mean of 46% of these autoradiography positive cells from the peripheral blood of patients with active RA bear CD3 markers and 61% Ia. On some occasions up to 25% stain for Leu M3 and 25% for Leu 7. None were esterase positive. Cell separation studies confirm that such cells were found in both T cell and non-T cell enriched populations. These cells, therefore, appear to be heterogeneous. A decreased number was seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients who had received remittive therapy for over 4 months when compared to other patients with RA and this was associated with a lower 4-h spontaneous uptake of labelled thymidine.\r"

Pursuant to this, we developed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of megestrol acetate in patients with cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia. We randomly assigned 133 eligible patients to receive 800 mg of megestrol acetate per day or a placebo. Patients assigned to megestrol acetate more frequently reported improved appetite (P = .003) and food intake (P = .009) when compared with patients receiving the placebo. A weight gain of 15 lb or more over baseline was seen in 11 of 67 (16%) patients receiving megestrol acetate compared with one of 66 (2%) given the placebo (P = .003). Patients receiving megestrol acetate reported significantly less nausea (13% vs. 38%; P = .001) and emesis (8% vs. 25%, P = .009). No clinically or statistically significant toxic reactions were ascribed to megestrol acetate, with the exception of mild edema. This study convincingly demonstrated that megestrol acetate can stimulate appetite and food intake in patients with anorexia and cachexia associated with cancer, leading to significant weight gain in a proportion of such patients.\r"

Biological assays such as specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used for the analysis of each cytokine. Urinary titers of interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor increased significantly after bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation but showed inter-individual differences. The maximum of secretion into the urine was seen between 4 and 8 hours after the instillation, and titers returned to baseline values within 24 hours. The differences in 24-hour secretion between the bacillus Calmette-Guerin-treated (10 patients) and the control (10) groups were significant with respect to all cytokines as tested in both assays each, except for the interleukin-1 biological assay. These results reflect the strong inflammatory response in the bladder wall to bacillus Calmette-Guerin, in which the urinary secretion of the detected cytokines may be associated with the local tumor control.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of transcranial Doppler sonography in determining severity of extracranial carotid disease, we compared transcranial Doppler, ocular pneumoplethysmography, Doppler spectral analysis, and duplex scanning data to information derived from cerebral angiography. Fifty-one consecutive patients with unilateral extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion were selected. Transcranial Doppler indexes included the peak systolic flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (iMCAFV), the difference between the peak systolic flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral and contralateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (dMCAFV), and the peak systolic flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery contralateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery (cACAFV). The minimal residual lumen determined angiographically was used as the index of internal carotid artery stenosis. Linear regression analysis with minimal residual lumen as the dependent variable and transcranial Doppler and noninvasive tests as independent variables showed the following correlation coefficients: (1) dMCAFV and cACAFV, R2 = 0.3170; (2) ocular pneumoplethysmography, R2 = 0.4798; (3) dMCAFV, cACAFV, delta ocular pneumoplethysmography, duplex scanning, and spectral analysis R2 = 0.6382; (4) ocular pneumoplethysmography, duplex scanning, and spectral analysis, R2 = 0.6491; (5) iMCAFV, no association. These results were supported by sensitivity and specificity as well as bivariate analysis. We conclude that transcranial Doppler did not significantly add to the information obtained by our noninvasive battery of tests in the evaluation of unilateral extracranial carotid disease.\r"

Unraveling the complex interreactions of the endothelial cell with the other cellular and molecular components of the arterial wall, as well as with the blood and its cellular and particulate components, is leading to better understanding of anastomotic hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis after endarterectomy and balloon angioplasty. More recently with the newly acquired techniques of inserting genetic material into the vascular endothelial cell many new therapeutic possibilities may be developed. Important to the technique of seeding vascular grafts, and the possible use of the genetically modified endothelial cell for gene therapy systems, are the needs to identify the origin of the cell originally seeded and ways to increase their number. Retroviral vectors and genetically conferred antibiotic resistance provide these means.\r"

The diagnosis of superficial phlebitis was made by the presence of palpable subcutaneous cords in the course of the greater saphenous vein or its tributaries in association with tenderness, erythema, and edema. The presence of concurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was assessed by impedance plethysmography in 37 patients, compression venous ultrasonography in 3 patients, and venography in 8 patients. Five of the 42 patients (12%) had DVT. Four of these five patients had a positive impedance plethysmographic or ultrasonographic test result followed by a confirmatory venogram. The fifth patient had a positive ultrasonographic test result, but no venogram was performed. Two of the five patients had clots that involved the popliteal or femoral veins. Four of 23 patients (17%) with superficial phlebitis at or above the knee had DVT. Only 1 of the 19 patients (5%) with superficial phlebitis below the knee had DVT. Three of the five patients with both superficial phlebitis and DVT had undergone surgery recently. All but 3 of the 42 patients (93%) had varicose veins. No patients had clinically apparent pulmonary emboli. DVT occurred in 17% of the patients with above-knee extension of the superficial phlebitis. In the clinical management of superficial lower-limb thrombophlebitis, noninvasive tests should be performed to guide therapy. When superficial phlebitis develops after recent surgery or the superficial phlebitis extends above the knee, diagnostic surveillance should be especially strict. When the noninvasive test results are equivocal, phlebography is indicated to rule out DVT.\r"

Although these results suggest a role for conditioned responses, the lack of concordance between the hormone levels and psychophysiological responses or self-report desire to drink does not support a conditioning hypothesis that could account clearly for consumption behavior. Alternative hypotheses are discussed.\r"

The effects of insulin were evaluated by means of a hyperinsulinemic \"clamp\" technique. No significant uptake of free fatty acids was found despite markedly elevated arterial concentrations (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 2.01 +/- 0.19 mmol.L-1), oleic acid, together with palmitic and linoleic acid, constituting 80% of the total plasma free fatty acid level. Insulin treatment (1 unit.kg bw-1.hr-1) prevented a further increase of the plasma free fatty acid level, observed concomitantly in the control group. Insulin affected all individual free fatty acids similarly. Changes in plasma free fatty acid levels occurring during the study and the corresponding myocardial uptake correlated (rS = 0.50 to 0.81). No significant uptake or release of glucose, lactate pyruvate, and glycerol occurred, whereas a myocardial release of alanine was seen. The heart and the concomitant leg uptake/release of glucose (rS = 0.40, p less than 0.05) and lactate (rS = 0.67, p less than 0.01) correlated. A substantial uptake of glucose was achieved and a more positive myocardial balance was obtained for alanine, lactate, and pyruvate with insulin. The changes in heart and the concomitant leg uptake/release correlated (glucose, rS = 0.62, p less than 0.01; lactate, rS = 0.64, p less than 0.01; pyruvate, rS = 0.71, p less than 0.01). It is concluded that the myocardial uptake of substrates during the first hours after coronary surgery is markedly abnormal with no uptake of free fatty acids or carbohydrates. These changes can be explained to some extent by the insulin resistance of trauma metabolism and can be modified by insulin treatment.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either cefazolin (n = 104) or cefuroxime (n = 109), the preoperative dose being given within 1 hour before the initial incision. Drugs were continued for 48 hours (cefazolin, 1 gm intravenously every 8 hours; cefuroxime, 1.5 gm intravenously every 12 hours). Postoperative infections were assessed by trained nurse clinicians, and data were analyzed by the intention-to-treat principle. Sternal wound infections or mediastinitis occurred in one of 104 patients treated with cefazolin and 10 of 109 treated with cefuroxime (p = 0.01). Deep sternal wounds (including mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis) occurred in none of the cefazolin-treated patients and five cefuroxime-treated patients (p = 0.06). Although overall nosocomial infection rates were similar (16.3 versus 19.3 per 100), wound infection occurred somewhat more frequently with streptococci (groups B and D) in patients receiving cefazolin (four versus zero, p = 0.110); conversely staphylococcal infections were more frequent in the cefuroxime group (seven versus one, p = 0.066). Mean and median postoperative stay was 1 day shorter in the cefazolin group. In contrast to findings of a previous report, our data indicate that cefazolin prevented more sternal wound infections than cefuroxime, a finding that supports prophylaxis with a first-generation cephalosporin.\r"

Despite enormous variability in symptoms and signs of dizziness, the clinician must strive to categorize the patient's problems according to localization and etiology. The rules of thumb outlined above may assist in that enterprise. The remainder of this issue includes discussion of several sophisticated diagnostic tests aimed at understanding the nature of dizziness. Some of them are well established and some are investigational. Even with such a diagnostic battery, dizziness remains a perplexing problem. The complexity of the vestibular system and its interactions with visual input, somatosensory input, motor response, and conscious awareness continue to challenge our technology and our clinical acumen.\r"

Results from 6000 patients collected over the past 10 years have shown that the temporal pattern of asymmetry can be reliably used to differentiate peripheral from central vestibular dysfunction. Peripheral cases tend to have a high level of asymmetry, with temporal regression to normal range, and a high correlation with patient symptoms. Central cases tend to have a low level of variable asymmetry and variable symptoms. In either case, phase can be abnormal or normal and cannot be reliably used to differentiate peripheral from central dysfunction. By combining phase and symmetry, the side of the lesion can be reliably determined. When phase is abnormal, asymmetry is toward the side of the lesion in 92 per cent of cases, whereas when phase is normal, asymmetry cannot be reliably used to determine side of lesion. SHA testing has contributed significantly to our clinical ability to fully evaluate the vestibular system and has become an indispensable part of the complete vestibular laboratory. It requires a relatively large patient load as well as software and hardware support to become a cost-effective utility.\r"

  ".W": "Rotational testing is useful for clinical evaluation of vestibular dysfunction affecting the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Early applications relied on visual observation of nystagmus following turning. In modern use, control theory descriptors (e.g., gain and phase) are applied to patient data for comparisons with normal values. Motorized rotational chairs are used to passively oscillate patients with sinusoidal harmonic acceleration (SHA) stimulus profiles, usually at low frequencies (0.02 to 0.2 Hz). Changes in low-frequency phase and asymmetry, relative to normal values, provide useful indications of pathology. Vestibular autorotation testing (VAT) is a new, portable testing technique that utilizes microcomputers and patients' active head movements at high frequencies (2 to 6 Hz) to test both horizontal and vertical VOR responses. A head strap contains sensors and microelectronics for monitoring both head and eye movements. Higher-frequency VOR testing offers the advantages that the VOR is most active during locomotion at these frequencies and that other ocular motor systems are functionally insensitive above about 1 Hz. Results from VAT evaluation of patients with acute-stage Meniere's disease showed high vertical VOR gains, whereas patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy showed pronounced low horizontal VOR gains and reduced phase lags. Practical experience in 4 years' clinical testing with the VAT has shown that this test is comfortable, efficient, clinically accurate, portable, and low cost, without requiring the dedicated, installed facility characteristic of other vestibular tests.\r"

Rather than serving as a test for specific pathologic conditions, the utility of posturography is in screening for balance disorders and in functionally defining different types of sensory deficits or central disorders. This functional information can be used to define restrictions or high-risk environments for patients, to guide rehabilitative balance therapy, and to monitor progression of recovery from a disease process.\r"

Here we describe a new specimen of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis, which consists of the right part of the face of an adult male with a portion of the frontal bone, a portion of the left part of the face and the maxilla with complete dentition except the right third molar. The characters of this specimen are not congruent with those of Sivapithecus and the pongids, but are more primitive and plesiomorphic for the recent hominid clade (Gorilla, Pan and Homo). The dental characters differ morphologically and metrically from those of the recent great apes and fit better with Australopithecus afarensis. Ouranopithecus now seems the best candidate forerunner of the Plio-pleistocene Homininae (Australopithecus and Homo). This specimen was discovered in September 1989, in the late Miocene deposits of central Macedonia (G.K., L. de B. and G.B.), and prepared by G.K. in Thessaloniki and G. Mouchelin in Poitiers. It comes from the new locality of Xirochori in the red sandstone of the Nea Messimbria formation. The fossil is the property of the University of Thessaloniki, Greece (catalogue number XIR-1).\r"

NMDA antagonists (such as AP5) prevent induction of long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic efficacy mediated by neural mechanisms that might also underlie learning and memory. They also attenuate memory formation in several behavioural tasks; there are few data, however, implicating an NMDA-sensitive measure of conditioning based on local infusion of antagonists into a brain area tightly coupled to the behavioural response used to assess conditioning. We now show that NMDA antagonists infused into the amygdala block the acquisition, but not the expression, of fear conditioning measured with a behavioural assay mediated by a defined neural circuit (fear-potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex). This effect showed anatomical and pharmacological specificity, and was not attributable to reduced salience of the stimuli of light or shock used in training. The data indicate that an NMDA-dependent process in the amygdala subserves associative fear conditioning.\r"

Most infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, and most of these carry the CD4 antigen. Adoptive transfer of T cells from diabetic NOD mice into irradiated NOD or athymic nude NOD mice induces diabetes. Susceptibility to IDDM in NOD mice is polygenic, with one gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex class II locus, which in NOD mice expresses a unique I-A molecule but no I-E. Speculation exists as to the role of the I-A molecule in the diabetes susceptibility of NOD mice, especially regarding the significance of specific unique residues. To examine the role of the NOD I-A molecule in IDDM pathogenesis, we made NOD/Lt mice transgenic for I-Ak by microinjecting I-Ak alpha- and beta-genes into fertilized NOD/Lt eggs. Insulitis was markedly reduced and diabetes prevented in NOD/Lt mice expressing I-Ak.\r"

  ".U": "90294905\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease with an autoimmune aetiology. The inbred non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain provides a good animal model of the human disease and genetic analysis suggests that, as in man, at least one of the several genes controlling the development of IDDM is linked to the major histocompatibility complex. The NOD mouse does not express I-E owing to a deletion in the promoter region of the I-E alpha-chain gene, and the sequence of NOD I-A beta-chain in the first external domain is unique with His 56 and Ser 57 replacing Pro and Asp, respectively, at these positions. There has been considerable interest in the role amino acid 57 might have in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including IDDM. The presence of a charged residue (such as Asp) at this position might affect the conformation of the peptide binding groove. But it could be assumed that Pro 56 gives rise to a different conformation of I-A beta-chain than does His 56. We therefore constructed transgenic NOD mice in which the transgene encoded a modified A beta nod with Pro 56, and studied its effect on the development of IDDM in this mouse strain. Previous studies have suggested that NOD mice expressing I-E as a result of the introduction of an I-E alpha-chain (E alpha) transgene are protected from the development of insulitis and hence IDDM. To explore further the protective effect of this molecule we constructed a second class of transgenic NOD mouse carrying an E alpha d transgene. Both transgenes protected the mice from IDDM, but this was not associated with a complete deletion of any T cells expressing commonly used T-cell receptor V beta genes.\r"

Alleles in this region can be exchanged between X and Y chromosomes and are therefore inherited as if autosomal. Genes from this so-called pseudoautosomal region (PAR) are present in two doses in both males and females, and escape inactivation of the X chromosome in females. Indirect evidence suggests that there must be several pseudoautosomal genes, and several candidates have been proposed. Until now, the only gene that has been unequivocally located in the PAR is MIC2, which encodes a cell-surface antigen of unknown function. We now report the localization of a gene of known function to this region--the gene for the receptor of the haemopoietic regulator, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. The chromosomal localization of this gene may be important in understanding the generation of M2 acute myeloid leukaemia.\r"

  ".U": "90294910\r", 
  ".W": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is often plasmid-mediated and the associated resistance genes encoded by transposable elements. Mycobacteria, including the human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae, are resistant to many antibiotics, and their cell-surface structure is believed to be largely responsible for the wide range of resistance phenotypes. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids have so far not been implicated in resistance of mycobacteria to antibiotics. Nevertheless, antibiotic-modifying activities such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases and phosphotransferases have been detected in fast-growing species. beta-lactamases have also been found in most fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria. To date no mycobacterial antibiotic-resistance genes have been isolated and characterized. We now report the isolation, cloning and sequencing of a genetic region responsible for resistance to sulphonamides in M. fortuitum. This region also contains an open reading frame homologous to one present in Tn1696 (member of the Tn21 family) which encodes a site-specific integrase. The mycobacterial resistance element is flanked by repeated sequences of 880 base pairs similar to the insertion elements of the IS6 family found in Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The insertion element is shown to transpose to different sites in the chromosome of a related fast-growing species, M. smegmatis. The characterization of this element should permit transposon mutagenesis in the analysis of mycobacterial virulence and related problems.\r"

  ".W": "In the CA1 hippocampal region, intracellular calcium is a putative second messenger for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a persistent increase of synaptic transmission produced by high frequency afferent fibre stimulation. Because LTP in this region is blocked by the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist AP5 (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) and the calcium permeability of NMDA receptors is controlled by a voltage-dependent magnesium block, a model has emerged that suggests that the calcium permeability of NMDA receptor-coupled ion channels is the biophysical basis for LTP induction. We have performed microfluorometric measurements in individual CA1 pyramidal cells during stimulus trains that induce LTP. In addition to a widespread component of postsynaptic calcium accumulation previously described, we now report that brief high frequency stimulus trains produce a transient component spatially localized to dendritic areas near activated afferents. This localized component is blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. The results directly confirm the calcium rise predicted by NMDA receptor models of LTP induction.\r"

  ".W": "Signalling by membrane immunoglobulin, the B-lymphocyte antigen receptor, regulates B-cell maturation and activation. Crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulin by antigen or by anti-immunoglobulin antibodies inactivates immature B cells, eliminating many of the B cells capable of producing auto-antibodies. By contrast, crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulin promotes activation of mature B cells for clonal expansion and antibody production against foreign antigens. Crosslinking membrane IgM on the immature B-cell line WEHI-231 induces growth arrest. This response may be analogous to the deletion or inactivation of immature B cells that is induced by antigen or anti-IgM antibodies. Membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis, which leads to increases in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C. The induced phosphoinositide breakdown is important for inhibiting WEHI-231 growth (ref. 7 and D. Page, M.R.G., K. Fahey, L. Matsuuchi and A.L.D., manuscript submitted for publication), but may not be sufficient, as agents that elevate calcium and activate protein kinase C cause only partial growth arrest. We now show that in both mature splenic B cells and the immature B-cell line WEHI-231 crosslinking membrane immunoglobulin also stimulates phosphorylation of protein tyrosine, a reaction that has been implicated as a key regulator of cell growth. Most of these phosphorylations were not a consequence of the phosphoinositide pathway. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is a second mode of transmembrane signalling by membrane immunoglobulin.\r"

Standardized inocula of protease-producing bacteria (10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/mL Staphylococcus aureus, incubated at 37C for 20 hours) reliably reduced fetal membrane structural integrity as reflected by bursting tension and work to rupture. Supraminimal inhibitory concentrations (supra-MICs) (erythromycin 0.23 microgram/mL; clindamycin 0.56 microgram/mL) and subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) (erythromycin 0.13 microgram/mL; clindamycin 0.06 microgram/mL) of both antibiotics prevented fetal membrane impairment due to test bacteria. Supra-MICs of both antibiotics prevented bacterial cell growth and release of protease. Sub-MICs of both antibiotics allowed bacterial cell growth of test microorganisms but inhibited protease release and subsequent fetal membrane damage. These findings suggest that inhibitory and even subinhibitory doses of antibiotics such as erythromycin and clindamycin may be effective in reducing the occurrence of premature rupture of membranes and subsequent preterm birth mediated by susceptible microorganisms.\r"

In light of this, the question of safety is of fundamental importance. Nondiagnostic ultrasound has been shown to produce biologic effects by thermal and cavitational activities. However, diagnostic ultrasound uses much lower intensities, and no evidence exists to suggest that it is associated with adverse effects. Numerous studies have examined the biologic effects of diagnostic ultrasound in insects, plants, cell suspensions, and even small mammals. The data from these experiments are confusing when attempting to relate these findings to the human. Epidemiologic data in humans, used to evaluate the potential adverse effects of exposure to diagnostic ultrasound, have revealed no ill effects from such exposure. Current data indicate that there are no confirmed biologic effects on patients and their fetuses from the use of diagnostic ultrasound and that the benefits to patients exposed to prudent use of diagnostic ultrasound outweigh the risks, if any. This review discusses the available information on the safety of obstetric ultrasonography.\r"

By using only maternal age and MSAFP level to determine Down syndrome risk, four of 16 (25%) Down syndrome pregnancies were identified, using risk estimates as a screening variable. This detection rate required performing amniocentesis on 4.8% of pregnancies with a normal outcome. By adding hCG level as a third risk parameter, ten of 16 (62.5%) Down syndrome pregnancies were detected. To achieve this detection rate, 4.7% of women under 35 would be recommended for amniocentesis. These results indicate that the estimation of risk for Down syndrome based on the addition of maternal hCG level to MSAFP level and maternal age will substantially improve the detection rate for Down syndrome, with no change in the amniocentesis rate. These findings are in agreement with other studies that suggest that hCG is a valuable addition to screening programs for Down syndrome.\r"

All patients were initially hydrated with 1 L of normal saline IV over 4 hours. Neither parenteral analgesics nor antiemetics were used. Bacteremia was noted in 13 (14.4%) of the 90 patients and mandated IV therapy. There was no difference between the oral and IV groups concerning predefined criteria for successful therapy (91.4 versus 92.9% successful therapy, respectively). No characteristic available at presentation predicted bacteremia or ultimate failure of therapy. Two patients (2.2%) experienced significant complications. These data suggest that in nonbacteremic patients, oral antibiotics are both safe and effective for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.\r"

There was also a decrease in the systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio in the flow velocity waveform in the uterine artery in seven subjects, whereas the S/D ratio was unaffected in five subjects. Lack of change in the S/D ratio was associated with a less optimal pregnancy outcome: The neonates were delivered earlier, the rate of cesarean delivery was higher, and the newborns were smaller. No changes were observed in the fetal heart rate pattern or in the umbilical or middle cerebral artery flow velocity waveforms after nifedipine in hypertensive pregnancies.\r"

Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between the two methods (r = 0.815; P less than .001) and yielded a factor that may be used on a general basis to derive the true amniotic fluid volume from the value obtained by sonography. This approach thus offers a standardized procedure for amniotic fluid volume estimation in the second trimester based on the technical simplicity of ultrasonography with the relative accuracy of the dye dilution technique.\r"

In 72 cases, an intravascular transfusion was also attempted at the same site. In 91.1% of the samplings, more than 1 mL of pure fetal blood was obtained, and in 89.9% of transfusions, fetal hematocrit or platelet concentration was raised to a satisfactory level. Fetal bradycardia and intraperitoneal bleeding occurred in 2.3% of the cases. Among fetuses at low risk, there was only one intrauterine death, which occurred 3 weeks after the procedure, and one spontaneous abortion in a patient with twin pregnancy. In fetuses with Rh/Kell alloimmunization or perinatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, the survival rate was 86%. Four liver enzymes were assayed in the blood of 13 fetuses that underwent transfusions at the intrahepatic vein and 13 controls in whom the site of sampling was the umbilical vein at the placental cord insertion. No differences were found between the groups at the subsequent transfusion 2-5 weeks later. The intrahepatic vein is an alternate site of sampling/transfusion when access is difficult or failure occurs at the placental cord insertion. This approach minimizes the risks of fetal blood loss, fetomaternal hemorrhage, arterial vasospasm, and cord tamponade.\r"

However, experienced sonographers with careful evaluation are successful in accurately diagnosing spina bifida only 80-90% of the time. This study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of certain cranial ultrasound markers--the \"lemon sign,\" cerebellar abnormalities, microcephaly, and ventriculomegaly--in facilitating the diagnosis of spina bifida in patients referred for prenatal diagnosis. Open spina bifida was diagnosed in 24 of 44 fetuses found to have neural tube defects. The lemon sign and cerebellar abnormalities were identified in all 16 fetuses in whom the diagnosis of spina bifida was made between 16-24 weeks' gestation. In four of these fetuses, the lemon sign and cerebellar abnormalities were noted 1-2 weeks before the spinal defect was identified. Microcephaly was present in 69% and ventriculomegaly in 63% of the cases. In the eight cases diagnosed after 24 weeks' gestation, the lemon sign was less reliable, being noted in only 25% of the fetuses. Ventriculomegaly increased in frequency to 75% and cerebellar abnormalities and microcephaly were present in all. Our findings indicate that these cranial ultrasound markers are extremely reliable for the early diagnosis of spina bifida; their identification should alert ultrasonographers at all skill levels to the possibility of open spina bifida.\r"

Total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and the HDL/LDL ratio were assessed after 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. There was a significant monotonic dose-response relationship of estrone sulfate in raising HDL levels, lowering LDL levels, and raising the HDL/LDL ratio at all intervals measured.

Of the patients undergoing resection of endometriosis but not presacral neurectomy (N = 9), none received relief of midline pain. Relief of lateral pain, back pain, and dyspareunia was variable in both groups. Our findings corroborate previous retrospective studies showing that presacral neurectomy is highly effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhea.

The contribution of patient-reported signs and symptoms versus objective uterine activity data to unscheduled visits is assessed. The overall frequency of unscheduled visits was similar in both groups. In the home uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support group, the contributions of uterine activity versus signs and symptoms to the diagnosis of preterm labor were equal, with 36% of patients diagnosed with preterm labor sent to the physician for increased uterine activity and 36% for signs and symptoms. The sensitivity for the group receiving monitoring and nursing support in detecting preterm labor was 93%. The majority of false-positive visits were associated with patient symptoms. These data show that this combination service does not lead to a clinically significant increase in unscheduled visits. Further, the visits resulting from the combination service provide a sensitive predictive method to aid physicians in detecting early labor.\r"

The combination of this assessment method to detect increased uterine activity at the earliest possible time and intensive perinatal nursing support as to symptomatology related to preterm labor has led to an earlier detection of preterm labor. This, when combined with a comprehensive program of preterm birth prevention, has in many studies resulted in a decrease in the number of early deliveries.

The more effective programs employed nurses who began visiting during pregnancy, who visited frequently and long enough to establish a therapeutic alliance with families, and who addressed the systems of behavioral and psychosocial factors that influence maternal and child outcomes.

In the corticosteroid group significantly more hospital admissions because of infectious diseases during the first years of life were reported. On the other variables no differences between the corticoid and the placebo groups were found.\r"

There was roentgenographic evidence of a periapical abscess. The diagnosis was revised to that of a cutaneous odontogenic sinus. The possibility of a draining dental sinus to the skin should be seriously considered when evaluating a suspected basal cell carcinoma in the perioral region--especially in an individual with a history of extensive dental treatments, antecedent oral trauma, or markedly carious teeth.\r"

In our opinion, only that part of the rectus abdominis muscle containing the vascular pedicle should be transposed with the TRAM flap. The Doppler probe provides a simple method of identifying the dominant intramuscular vascular axis. It consistently alerts the surgeon to any unusual position of a vessel at the costal margin or within the rectus abdominis muscle. This knowledge enables a conservative yet safe dissection of the vascular pedicle, rectus abdominis muscle, and its sheath. This in turn will enable a competent abdominal closure. The Doppler technique is safe, simple, quick, noninvasive, familiar to most surgeons, and applicable to all patients.\r"

In two immunocompetent individuals, infection followed dissemination from traumatic wounds. Common clinical findings were a rapid decrease in visual acuity and eye pain. All nine of the previously reported cases resulted in total blindness of the involved eye; five patients died not long after diagnosis. In the present report (the first in a cardiac transplant recipient), a favorable outcome with restoration of vision followed early diagnosis through the recently developed technique of fine-needle retinal biopsy.\r"

Recently, we treated a child who developed peritonitis due to Kluyvera ascorbata. The repeated isolation of the organism in pure culture from the peritoneal fluid and its isolation from postmortem subdiaphragmatic microabscesses suggest that Kluyvera can be clinically significant. Review of the literature clearly indicates that Kluyvera strains are infrequent but potentially dangerous pathogens in humans. Further experience is needed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the various antibiotics to which these bacteria are sensitive in vitro.\r"

In the preantibiotic era, pneumococcal genital infection was more common than today, and the rate of lethality was high--26% for localized infection and 74% for peritonitis. During the last 25 years, all 24 patients reported worldwide survived their pneumococcal genital infections, including nine patients at our hospital; in contrast, five of 12 women died between 1938 and 1952. Pneumococci can rarely be isolated as the only pathogen in cases of bartholinitis. Neonatal S. pneumoniae disease with an early onset has an intrapartum pathogenesis. Of 23 reported pediatric patients (including one whom we treated), 48% died and 13% survived with neurologic sequelae. The prognosis for these children has not improved during the last 10 years.\r"

Intramedullary spinal tuberculomas occurred in relatively young patients (mean age, 28.6 years) and more frequently in women (63% of cases) than in men. The commonest symptoms were those of subacute spinal cord compression (mean duration, 2.3 months) with progressive lower-limb weakness (94%), paresthesia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The major physical finding was paraplegia, either spastic (61%) or flaccid (33%). The majority of patients (55%) had a thoracic sensory level. Extraspinal tuberculous disease, predominantly pulmonary, occurred in 69% of reported cases. Myelography efficiently localized the lesion. The diagnosis was made surgically in 16 patients (89%) and clinically in two (11%). Eleven (65%) of 17 patients improved. Four deaths occurred, three in the perioperative period. Though rare, intramedullary spinal cord tuberculoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal cord compression, particularly when clinical disease compatible with tuberculosis is present.\r"

Clinical presentation was typical of bacterial meningitides. Overall mortality rate was 30%. The best predictors of poor outcome were initial hemodynamic instability and age greater than 60 years. Documented bacteremia (40% of cases) was not predictive of higher mortality. Effective therapy is based on early recognition of the possibility of P. multocida meningitis and prompt initiation of treatment with penicillin, ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin.\r"

In residential districts of port cities such as Baltimore, nearly 50% of Norway rats are infected with viruses that are serologically indistinguishable from disease-causing Hantavirus strains isolated from rats in the Far East. Despite the widespread distribution of Hantavirus-infected rodents, confirmed cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have not been recognized in the United States. Moreover, the overall risk of hantavirus infection in humans in the United States is low, even among individuals who have frequent exposure to commensal and wild rodents. Studies are needed to define the clinical spectrum of hantavirus infection in humans in the United States.\r"

With all antibiotics, a single-dose was less efficient than a 3-day or greater than or equal to 5-day treatment in eradicating bacteriuria. The difference was more pronounced with beta-lactams than with trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations. With the latter antibacterial agent, no benefits were achieved by increasing treatment times to greater than or equal to 5 days. Beta-lactam antibiotics were more effective when administered for greater than or equal to 5 days than when given as a 3-day course. Short-term treatment was more effective with trimethoprim/sulfonamide than with beta-lactams. Adverse reactions did not increase with treatment time when penicillins or norfloxacin was used, which was the case with oral cephalosporins. With trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations, adverse reactions increased markedly when treatment was given for greater than 3 days. In conclusion, single-dose treatment is less efficient than treatment for greater than or equal to 3 days, beta-lactams should be administered for greater than or equal to 5 days, the optimal treatment time with trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations seems to be 3 days, and considerable differences exist among various antibiotics.\r"

Thirty-one cases of biliary tract and gallbladder candidiasis, including nine in our series, have been examined. The same risk factors that predispose patients to other forms of candidal infection are implicated here. No mortality was found with uncomplicated candidal cholecystitis in nonneutropenic patients treated with cholecystectomy alone. Patients with associated extrabiliary tract candidiasis or candidemia had worse outcomes and required both surgical intervention and antifungal therapy. When risk factors exist for the development of biliary tract or gallbladder candidiasis, the physician should be alert to this possibility. There is no need for antifungal therapy in cases of isolated candidiasis of the gallbladder in nonneutropenic patients.\r"

Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia was present in all patients, and bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of Leishmania in macrophages. We conclude that in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic, early bone marrow aspirate should, in most instances, be performed in patients with bacterial infection associated with anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia if hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly is present.\r"

A portal of entry, mainly cutaneous, was recognized in 61% of the patients, and a chronic underlying condition was observed in 69%. The case-fatality rate was 27%, with death occurring predominantly in patients admitted with shock or cryptogenic bacteremia. Our clinical experience and literature review show that the presentation of group A streptococcal bacteremia is diverse, with transient bacteremia of uncertain clinical significance on one end of the spectrum and overwhelming sepsis on the other. A practical classification of the various clinical forms of group A streptococcal bacteremia is proposed.\r"

The virus transit speed along the nerve of 2.4 mm/h has been used in calculating the incubation time. The calculated incubation time for Cutter vaccinees is similar to the actual times reported, and the calculated minimal and maximal incubation times in humans are similar to the published ranges. Incubation times in different animals and for different paralyses are explained. The pathology of lesions in humans and the consequent paralyses are compatible with the model. Tonsillectomy-associated poliomyelitis is reviewed and discussed in relation to possible entry of virus from peripheral nerve endings in muscle. Increased lymphocyte concentrations in the muscle may account for continuing susceptibility after tonsillectomy. Severe paralysis following exercise is explained as an effect of increased blood supply to nerves in the CNS that has already been invaded by virus. In developing countries, the phenomenon of paralysis in the injected muscle a few hours after injection in febrile children may occur in a similar fashion. The entry of poliovirus from many sites at nerve endings in muscles is consistent with clinical, experimental, and pathologic data and provides an explanation of the incubation times and related phenomena of poliomyelitis.\r"

The P47gag-crk oncoprotein contains SH2 and SH3 domains, which are conserved in several proteins involved in signal transduction, including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. P47gag-crk bound in vitro to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from crk-transformed cells and from cells transformed by oncogenic tyrosine kinases. The association between P47gag-crk and p60v-src, a phosphotyrosine-containing protein, was abolished by dephosphorylation of p60v-src. This suggests that the SH2 and SH3 regions function to regulate protein interactions in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner.\r"

The B chain is the homolog of the v-sis oncogene product. Properties that distinguish these ligands include greater transforming potency of the B chain and more efficient secretion of the A chain. By a strategy involving the generation of PDGF A and B chimeras, these properties were mapped to distinct domains of the respective molecules. Increased transforming efficiency segregated with the ability to activate both alpha and beta PDGF receptors. These findings genetically map PDGF B residues 105 to 144 as responsible for conformational alterations critical to beta PDGF receptor interaction and provide a mechanistic basis for the greater transforming potency of the PDGF B chain.\r"

This factor, designated beta gamma, drastically reduces the affinity of RNA polymerase II for free DNA containing either promoter or nonpromoter sequences. In this respect, beta gamma functions as does the bacterial transcription initiation factor sigma 70, which expedites the binding of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to promoters in part by accelerating dissociation of the polymerase from nonpromoter sites in DNA.\r"

No differences were found preoperatively and postoperatively in the cystometric values or in the urethral pressure profiles at rest in both groups and between the groups. The pressure transmission ratios were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups. The postoperative transmission ratios in the premenopausal women were found to be significantly higher than those in the postmenopausal group, at the middle two-quarters of the urethra. Although surgical treatment for urinary stress incontinence in postmenopausal women results in lower cure rates than in younger women, it should be considered.\r"

Fifty-eight of the patients had undergone previous surgical treatment, including either vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy. Twenty-two patients underwent CSP alone, 24 had CSP and retropubic urethropexy (RPU), eight had CSP with anterior or posterior repair, or both, and five had CSP and RPU with anterior and posterior repair. The operations were associated with a minimum of intraoperative complications and acceptable postoperative problems. A postoperative questionnaire was sent to the patients with an 89 per cent response rate. None of the patients complained of protrusion from the vagina. It is concluded that, in the hands of experienced surgeons, CSP is a safe, efficacious operative procedure that should remain the procedure of choice for vaginal vault prolapse since it restores the normal vaginal axis, maintains existing vaginal length and provides permanent care.\r"

  ".W": "The frequent coexistence of adenoma with primary carcinoma of the colon and their association with higher incidences of both synchronous and metachronous carcinomas offers only circumstantial evidence that adenomas are premalignant lesions. Detailed histopathologic investigations, however, have documented the transition from adenoma to carcinoma. Although the common, minute adenomatous polyp has a low potential of malignancy, the risk increases with size, villous architecture and degree of epithelial dysplasia. Furthermore, the association of dysplasia, which shares many adenomatous features with carcinoma in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis, and the inevitable development of adenomatous polyps followed by carcinoma of the colon and rectum in patients with familial polyposis further support this concept. Most colorectal malignant lesions, therefore, are believed to progress through the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. Moreover, histochemical investigations have demonstrated that abnormalities of DNA content, enzyme activities, CEA expression and mucin composition are shared by both adenoma and carcinoma. Thus, the malignancy potential of adenoma of the colon and rectum is reflected not only in the overt histologic transition to carcinoma, but in the disruption of the genetic and biochemical control mechanisms of cellular function as well.\r"

In patients ten to 30 years of age--the age group associated with a higher incidence of acute appendicitis--who are otherwise healthy, incidental appendectomy is effective in preventing morbidity and death associated with acute appendicitis. In patients 30 to 50 years of age, incidental appendectomy should be left to the discretion of the surgeon. In this age group, the physician should give special consideration to the gender of the patient and the desire for future childbirth. In patients more than 50 years of age, the incidence of acute appendicitis decreases and the risk associated with operation and prolonged anesthesia is such that an incidental appendectomy is not beneficial. In mentally handicapped patients less than 50 years of age and who are physically healthy, incidental appendectomy should be performed. An inversion technique should be used in all instances of incidental appendectomy. In otherwise clean cases in which incidental appendectomy is anticipated, prophylactic antibiotics may be of value. Patients undergoing procedures that may compromise access to the appendix in the future should undergo incidental appendectomy.\r"
