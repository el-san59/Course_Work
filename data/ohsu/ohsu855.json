  ".W": "In this study monoclonal antibodies which recognize lymphoid-associated antigens on paraffin sections (LN1, MB2, L26, MT2, UCHL1) have been evaluated to assess their usefulness in the distinction between reactive and neoplastic lesions of lymphoid follicles. Thirty-three follicular lymphoma samples and 36 reactive samples (lymph nodes and tonsils) were analyzed. MT2 appeared as the most valuable immunophenotypic marker as emerged from a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 2329 reactive follicles and 2288 neoplastic follicles performed on MT2 immunostained sections. MT2-positive follicles were found in all lymphoma samples but one. Overall 1908 of 2288 neoplastic follicles were judged as positive whereas no follicles with comparable strong MT2 immunoreactivity could be found in non neoplastic samples. These latter showed weak MT2 positivity only in about 10% (224/2329) of reactive follicles. This study confirms that MT2 follicular positivity can be considered a reliable marker of follicular neoplasia, although negative results ought to be considered with caution. The detection of centrofollicular cells outside the germinal centers, which is considered a reliable criterion of follicular neoplasia, was highly improved by LN1 immunostaining. On the other hand pan-B antibodies such as L26 and MB2 were less informative because of the large number of B-lymphocytes observed in interfollicular areas of nonneoplastic samples.\r"

The age of the patients varied from 22 to 83 years old, with a male to female ratio of 8 to 1. They complained of intermittent fever and abdominal pain, and laboratory data on admission suggested an inflammatory process. The solitary or multiple, well-defined space-occupying lesions were displayed by recently advanced imaging techniques. Partial hepatectomy, laparotomy, needle biopsy, or autopsy was performed in all nine patients with diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic liver tumor, or liver abscess. Histologically, these lesions were composed of dense hyalinized fibrosis and/or infiltrating inflammatory cells constituting large numbers of foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Obliterating phlebitis of relatively large branches of the portal vein was found, thus providing a diagnostic clue to distinction from the primary hepatic cancer by imagings. Considering the clinicopathologic features and the patients' histories, in which four patients had been in the Southeast Asian countries or India, it is possible that infection of microorganisms through the portal vein could participate in these lesions as a cause. Two patients died of causes probably related to this lesion, indicating poor prognosis in some patients, in contrast to the generally fair prognosis of previously published cases.\r"

All three tumors were large (average diameter, 5 cm) and infiltrated deep into the stomach wall. Two of the tumors had a polypoid configuration; the third was ulcerated and endophytic. Intestinal metaplasia was present adjacent to the tumor in all cases, with dysplasia in two. Immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and epithelial membrane antigen in the epithelial component of all tumors, and Leu-M1 was positive in the epithelial component of one. The spindle cell components contained vimentin, and in tumor 2, the spindle cell component was also positive for desmin. Two tumors showed focal positivity for cytokeratin in the spindle cells immediately adjacent to the epithelial component. Ultrastructurally, the spindle cell component of two tumors was composed of undifferentiated cells without specific epithelial or mesenchymal features. The third tumor contained occasional cells with features of myofibroblasts.\r"

Eighteen of these patients (58%) obtained disease-free status; 11 with chemotherapy alone and seven with adjunctive surgery. Eleven have remained continuously free of disease. Two have had recurrence of teratoma and are disease-free after resection of teratoma at 12+ and 68+ months. Three patients developed recurrence of germ cell tumor. Three patients developed a hematologic malignancy. Of the 18 patients who obtained disease-free status, 15 remain alive and disease-free. Overall, 13 of the 31 patients and 24 other patients received salvage chemotherapy at Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana. Of these 37 patients, six obtained a disease-free status and four (11%) remain alive at 13+, 56+, 78+, and 122+ months, respectively. This series represents the largest series of patients with MNGCT ever reported. Analysis of these data and results from other recent series suggest that approximately 50% of patients with MNGCT will be cured with modern, intense cisplatin-based chemotherapy coupled with adjunctive surgery if needed.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1965 and 1987, 190 patients with nonmetastatic and 134 patients with metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) underwent initial metastatic survey at the Southeastern Regional Trophoblastic Disease Center (Durham, NC). These patients were evaluated for characteristics which might predict the presence of high-risk metastases before a full radiographic survey was obtained. Minimal staging evaluation of all patients included history and examination, quantitative HCG level by beta-subunit radioimmunoassay, chest radiograph, and evaluation for brain and liver metastases with radionuclide or computed tomography (CT) scans. Seventeen patients had high-risk sites of metastases (i.e., those outside lungs, vagina, or pelvis). Characteristics were identified which might predict high-risk metastases: (1) all had metastases in lungs or vagina; (2) 13 of 17 (76%) had at least one other high risk factor (i.e., beta-HCG titer greater than 40,000 mIU/ml, greater than 4 months since onset of symptoms or antecedent term pregnancy; and (3) 15 of 17 (88%) had obvious symptoms or signs related to high-risk metastasis. The authors then evaluated these criteria to identify high-risk metastasis: (1) asymptomatic patients with GTD are screened for therapy with history and physical examination, HCG level, and chest radiograph or CT of the lungs; and (2) further radiographic imaging is used only for patients with signs or symptoms of high-risk metastases, identifiable lung or pelvic metastases, or other high-risk clinical factors. Using this criteria, patients with high-risk metastases were identified with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 63%. Approximately 60% of patients did not require further radiographic evaluation.\r"

In the 200 mg group there was a significant decrease, compared with placebo, in systolic blood pressure at 0.5 min (144 +/- 32.1 vs 165 +/- 18.7 mmHg) and 1.5 min (154 +/- 25.0 vs 170 +/- 19.5 mmHg) after intubation.

Forty-eight ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing hysterectomy were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous bolus of placebo, esmolol 100 mg, or esmolol 200 mg in a double-blind fashion. This was administered over 15 sec, and immediately followed by thiopentone 3-5 mg.kg-1, succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1, and tracheal intubation 90 sec later. The heart rate following induction of anaesthesia was lower in the esmolol 200 mg group (P less than 0.01); following intubation, the increase in heart rate in the placebo group was greater than in the esmolol groups (P less than 0.05). The systolic blood pressure post-induction was lower in the esmolol 200 mg group (P less than 0.05); following intubation, however, no significant differences were seen among groups in systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressures. Following tracheal intubation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was lower in the esmolol groups (P less than 0.05). In summary, esmolol in 100 mg and 200 mg doses was effective in mitigating the haemodynamic response following tracheal intubation.\r"

The pathogenesis of pulmonary oedema associated with upper airway obstruction is multifactorial. However, as the phrase \"negative pressure pulmonary oedema\" suggests, markedly negative intrapleural pressure is the dominant pathophysiological mechanism involved in the genesis of pulmonary oedema associated with upper airway obstruction. The frequency of the event is impossible to ascertain from the literature but paediatric cases requiring airway intervention for croup or epiglottitis and adults requiring airway intervention for emergence laryngospasm or upper airway tumours account for over 50 per cent of the documented cases in each age group, respectively. Individuals at risk should be observed closely while they remain at risk. The majority of cases present within minutes either of the development of acute severe upper airway obstruction or of relief of the obstruction. Resolution is typically rapid, over a period of a few hours. Rarely is anything more required for management than the maintenance of a patent airway, supplemental oxygen, and, in approximately 50 per cent of cases, mechanical ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure.\r"

Nine of the patients proved to have beta 2-microglobulin amyloid deposits as demonstrated by Congo red staining and by immunofluorescence. They had undergone dialysis for longer time periods (12.6 vs 8.5 years, p less than 0.02) and tended to be older than the 13 amyloid-negative patients. They also had a significantly higher body aluminum overload, as demonstrated by a higher increase of plasma aluminum after desferrioxamine infusion. Finally, the presence of Congo-red-positive deposits correlated well with clinical and x-ray findings suggestive of dialysis amyloidosis.\r"

  ".W": "By the time that the pelvalgia patient seeks treatment, her chronic tension, anxiety, stress, and related somatic symptoms, which usually have moderated her fear of repeat assault or punishment by the aggressor-parent, has begun to disintegrate. The patient usually has little or no insight into the fact that her feelings of being trapped, helpless, and victimized in her marriage, job, or other interpersonal relationships can be symbols of the original sexual trauma. The depressed patient may be unaware that suicidal thoughts and actions, if present, are a reflection of her sense of helplessness, hopelessness, and victimization. Hence, CPP may be a symptom of a wide spectrum of disorders, both organic and psychological. While the patient is undergoing evaluation of pelvic pain, it is essential that clinicians remain aware that the patient's psychogenic symptoms are an attempt to reinforce a faltering ego. Additionally, it is important that they recognize that previous attempts at diagnosis and therapy of CPP and other somatic complaints usually have reinforced the belief that the symptoms are physically based and unrelated to any psychological factors. A number of prospective studies currently are underway to characterize further the relationships between complaints of chronic pelvic pain, personality functioning, and history of sexual trauma. Without data on very long-term follow-up, our understanding of the precise psychodevelopmental pathophysiology and long-term prognosis of CPP currently remains incomplete.\r"

  ".W": "Twin gestation is now an area of vital concern to the perinatologist. Within the last decade a substantial reduction in perinatal mortality has been achieved, largely through advances in neonatal intensive care. However, preterm birth and its consequences remain the most important causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Twin pregnancy accounts for approximately 10% of all premature deliveries. From the data currently available, there is no justification for the routine use of hospital bedrest, prophylactic tocolytic agents, or elective cerclage in the management of twin pregnancy. Programs directed at the prevention of perterm delivery in twin pregnancy will be the focus of more scientific research. The use of ultrasound and antepartum testing in the form of the nonstress test, the biophysical profile, and Doppler ultrasound may lead to major advances in the diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation and the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in twins. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that fetal death and neonatal death from intrauterine growth retardation can be prevented.\r"

  ".W": "1. The use of ultrasound may improve perinatal outcome in twin pregnancy. 2. Singleton growth curves for FL, BPD, and AC may be used to assess fetal growth prior to 28 weeks gestation. 3. After 28 weeks gestation, specific twin growth curves should be used. However, increased morbidity may be seen when fetal weight falls from the normal singleton predictive curves. 4. Amnionicity and chorionicity frequently can be determined. This should be attempted early in the second trimester so that appropriate monitoring can be offered for the monoamnionic and monochorionic gestations. 5. Serial assessment of fetal growth should be performed. In the authors' institutions, growth scans are performed in twins every 2 weeks after 24 weeks gestation. 6. Evidence on ultrasound examination of discordant growth suggests either fetal growth retardation or TTS. In the presence of a dichorionic placentation, growth retardation of one twin is the usual diagnosis. If placentation is monochorionic, it is difficult to differentiate between growth retardation and TTS. The presence of polyhydramnios, a stuck twin, or fetal hydrops are suggestive of TTS. 7. The value and safety of cordocentesis and the management of twin pregnancy and diagnosis of TTS have not been established. 8. Doppler ultrasound may be useful in the assessment of the IUGR twin fetus. The use of Doppler in the identification of TTS is not yet clear.\r"

Increased morbidity is associated primarily with monozygotic twins who have vascular anastomoses associated with diamniotic-monochorionic placentation, and with monoamniotic twins. Morbidity and mortality of these twin gestations potentially can be reduced with identification of the at-risk pregnancy and with intensive antenatal surveillance. The most difficult management problem is the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which will require improved technologic developments to resolve.\r"

Other antidepressant agents--notably amitriptyline--are known to ameliorate postherpetic neuralgia, but those agents are often toxic. In a randomized double-blind crossover design, we gave 26 postherpetic neuralgia patients 6 weeks of treatment with desipramine (mean dose, 167 mg/day) and placebo. Nineteen patients completed both treatments; 12 reported at least moderate relief with desipramine and two reported relief with placebo. Pain relief with desipramine was statistically significant from weeks 3 to 6. Psychiatric interview at entry into the study produced a diagnosis of depression for 4 patients; pain relief was similar in depressed and nondepressed patients and was statistically significant in the nondepressed group alone. We conclude that desipramine administration relieves postherpetic neuralgia and that pain relief is not mediated by mood elevation. Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, an action shared by desipramine, amitriptyline, and other antidepressant agents that have relieved neuropathic pain, may be involved in relief of postherpetic neuralgia.\r"

Sixty-five smokers who were highly dependent on cigarettes participated in the study, which included a behavioral smoking-cessation program. The rates of continuous abstinence were significantly higher in the nicotine group both initially (55% versus 34%) and at 3 weeks (18% versus 6%). Certain smoking withdrawal symptoms, including negative affect and hypoarousal, were effectively relieved by the nicotine patch. There was a trend toward a reduction in cigarette craving, whereas hunger and habit withdrawal symptoms were not affected. The main side effect associated with the nicotine patch was skin irritation. These findings suggest that a nicotine skin patch may be a useful aid to smoking cessation; however, the combination of other techniques with nicotine replacement may provide a more effective treatment for symptoms such as craving for cigarettes.\r"

After a 100 mg intravenous infusion, pentoxifylline elimination half-life was prolonged in cirrhotic patients (2.12 +/- 1.22 hours versus 0.83 +/- 0.29 hours, p less than 0.05) because of a decrease in its plasma clearance (1.44 +/- 0.46 L.hr-1.kg-1 in patients with cirrhosis versus 3.62 +/- 0.75 L.hr-1.kg-1 in volunteers, p less than 0.001). The elimination half-life of the metabolite (5-hydroxypentoxifylline) was similar to that of the parent compound. After oral administration of a 400 mg sustained-released tablet, absolute bioavailability of pentoxifylline increased in cirrhotic patients (0.71 +/- 0.24 versus 0.33 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.01). Although plasma concentrations of pentoxifylline and hydroxypentoxifylline were significantly increased in cirrhotic patients, the AUCpentoxifylline/AUChydroxypentoxifylline ratio remained unchanged in both groups after either intravenous or oral administration. These findings show that liver cirrhosis profoundly alters the pharmacokinetics of pentoxifylline. However the formation of hydroxypentoxifylline is not modified in these patients, suggesting an extrahepatic metabolism.\r"

Each subject received 150 mg ranitidine or placebo orally 2 hours before administration of the Heidelberg capsule. A 500 kcal standardized breakfast was served 1/2 hour before the capsule was administered. Gastric pH was monitored at 15-minute intervals, until pyloric passage (pH increase greater than or equal to 3 U) of the Heidelberg capsule was observed. Blood samples (n = 12) were collected 0 to 8 hours after administration of drug or placebo. The subjects continued to receive ranitidine or placebo b.i.d. for 7 days and returned on day 8 for a similar evaluation. After a 1-week washout period, the subjects received the alternative treatment. The mean (+/- SD) gastric residence time of the Heidelberg capsule was significantly decreased after both single and multiple doses of ranitidine compared to placebo (3.1 +/- 0.9 versus 3.8 +/- 1.1 hours, p less than 0.02; and 2.9 +/- 0.74 versus 3.9 +/- 0.9 hours, p less than 0.005, n = 9). Gastric residence time was not determined in three subjects who showed unusually slow gastrointestinal motility after both placebo and ranitidine. Mean AUC(0-8 hr) and AUC(0-infinity) were significantly increased, whereas Cmax, tmax, and t1/2 remained unchanged after 7 days of ranitidine b.i.d. treatment.

Patients received a single dose of either 400 units of calcitonin delivered as a nasal spray, or 1, 10 or 100 units of subcutaneous calcitonin, or placebo. 2. Subcutaneous salmon calcitonin, administered at doses of 1, 10 and 100 units to nine patients with Paget's disease of bone, induced a dose-dependent fall in the serum calcium. This calcium-lowering effect was not seen with a second group of nine patients receiving placebo. 3. The lower doses of calcitonin had significant effects, and these were more pronounced in patients with lower rates of bone turnover. 4. Four hundred units of calcitonin administered as a nasal spray induced effects qualitatively similar to those seen with subcutaneous calcitonin, with an efficacy equivalent to approximately 30 units of subcutaneous calcitonin. 5. We conclude that the bioequivalence of calcitonin given by intranasal insufflation is low compared with its parenteral administration. The intranasal route may be more appropriate for managing patients with disorders associated with low bone turnover.\r"

Broadband ultrasound attenuation in three prospective amputees showed a high degree of concordance between measurements in vivo and in vitro, with no interference by surrounding soft tissues. 5. The correlation between physical density and broadband ultrasound attenuation was independent of quantitative computed tomography, suggesting that the technique measures aspects of density which differ from its mineral density. Broadband ultrasound attenuation holds promise as a reproducible, rapid, radiation-free assessment of skeletal status.\r"

Broadband ultrasound attenuation correlated significantly with bone mineral content measured in the distal forearm by single-photon absorptiometry (r = 0.77, P less than 0.0001) and with bone mineral content (r = 0.66, P less than 0.0001) and bone mineral density (r = 0.72, P less than 0.0001) measured in the lumbar spine by dual-photon absorptiometry. 4. Although significant, these correlations are not sufficiently close to be predictive. However, the accuracy of broadband ultrasound attenuation in discriminating between normal subjects and patients with vertebral fracture compared very favourably with direct measurements in the spine by dual-photon absorptiometry. 5. Broadband ultrasound attenuation, but not the other measurements, correlated significantly with age in the osteoporotic patients (r = 0.50, P less than 0.05). 6. These findings may reflect the partial dependence of broadband ultrasound attenuation on the intrinsic trabecular architecture of cancellous bone, the disruption of which contributes to an increase in fracture risk.\r"

The synthesis of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide from nicotinamide and nicotinic acid was compared over different time scales at both physiological (0.7 mumol/l) and high (0.2-3 mmol/l) substrate concentrations in erythrocytes from three patients with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.8) deficiency (including one Lesch-Nyhan patient) and from one patient with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity. The above disorders are associated with grossly altered erythrocyte nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide levels. 2. At the physiological substrate concentration and incubation times up to 2 h, nicotinamide proved the most efficient nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide precursor for erythrocytes from both patients and control subjects. The conversion of nicotinamide to its mononucleotide, but not further metabolism, was impaired in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-mutant cells. The Lesch-Nyhan and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-mutant cells were unusual in that both showed no further stimulation of nucleotide synthesis at 18 mmol/l Pi compared with 1 mmol/l. 3. At the high substrate concentrations, using 18 mmol/l Pi, nicotinamide was a poor precursor in all instances. Using nicotinic acid, nucleotide formation was 30-fold that from nicotinamide, reaching its maximum at 0.2 mmol/l. Conversion of nicotinic acid to nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-mutant cells was again grossly impaired. 4. There was no evidence for increased nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide breakdown in the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-mutant cells under any of the above conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is a major limitation of this modality. Color Doppler, on the other hand, is less time consuming and more reproducible. However, when color Doppler is not available, conventional Doppler in the hands of an expert operator is useful for accurate detection and semiquantitation of aortic regurgitation. Also, it should be noted that color Doppler is not precise in estimation of the severity of aortic regurgitation. Color flow mapping of aortic regurgitation still remains a semiquantitative method. Thus conventional Doppler may need to be used to supplement the color Doppler examination, especially in the assessment of severity of aortic regurgitation, even when access to color flow mapping is readily available.\r"

Rest radionuclide angiography measurement of ejection fraction is a simple informative study to help evaluate the appropriate timing for valve replacement in the asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms. In patients with normal ejection fractions the disease probably has not yet evolved to the phase in which valve replacement is essential. If the ejection fraction is mildly depressed (0.40 to 0.49) the time is right for intervention. By the time the ejection fraction falls to less than 0.40 the left ventricle is likely damaged and unlikely to regain normal function. If the patient has severe symptoms with maximal medical therapy, surgery is indicated no matter what the ejection fraction. The latter situation can arise especially when aortic regurgitation evolves over a short period, as might be the case in patients with bacterial endocarditis. A single ejection fraction measurement is not as reliable as serial studies. If, for example, the ejection fraction (under similar circumstances) falls from the greater than or equal to 0.50 range to the 0.40 to 0.49 range, the physician should be altered to the possibility that the left ventricle is deteriorating, and surgery should be considered. It should be understood that multiple hemodynamic factors in aortic regurgitation can alter the ejection fraction and could limit its use as the sole measure of left ventricular performance. Other systolic or diastolic parameters cannot be relied on in isolation as an indication or contraindication for aortic valve replacement. The exercise ejection fraction response reflects the total stroke volume and does not distinguish between regurgitant flow and forward flow. It is therefore possible to observe a decrease in ejection fraction in association with an increase in forward stroke volume during exercise as a result of an increase in heart rate and a decrease in peripheral resistance. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to compare the ejection fraction during exercise in aortic insufficiency with the expected response of the normal ventricle. Exercise position (sitting vs. supine) affects loading conditions and ejection fraction response. Because of the complexity of the exercise ejection fraction response, it is not clear that there is a role for exercise ejection fraction measurements in determining the appropriate time for aortic valve replacement. Criteria based on supine exercise may not be applicable to studies in the upright position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Leakage and stenosis are serious complications of gastrointestinal anastomotic surgery that may, in part, be related to local ischemia. The ability to accurately quantitate the degree of gastrointestinal anastomotic ischemia remains a challenging clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to: 1) develop a model of colorectal anastomotic stenosis following local ischemia; 2) compare the accuracy of laser Doppler velocimetry and intramural colonic pH in quantitating critical levels of intestinal anastomotic ischemia; and 3) compare the anastomotic healing process using either a standard two-layer Czerny-Lembert handsewn or EEATM stapled anastomotic technique under ischemic conditions. The studies reported here were performed in two phases. Phase I was the pilot study in which the authors developed a model of colorectal anastomotic ischemia and defined critical levels of ischemia using laser Doppler velocimetry and intramural pH (less than or equal to 200 mV; less than or equal to 7.0, respectively). These parameters were then tested prospectively in Phase II, assessing the effects of anastomotic ischemia on animals kept alive for 5, 11, 21, and 60 days after surgery. Overall there was a 70 percent incidence of anastomotic healing complications in the Phase II trial with laser Doppler velocimetry correctly predicting anastomotic outcome in 70 percent of cases and tissue pH in 93 percent of cases. The results indicate that, although laser Doppler velocimetry and intramural pH measurements provide safe, easy techniques for assessing the effects of ischemia on the colorectal anastomosis, measurement of intramural pH provides an optimal quantitative method for predicting subsequent anastomotic outcome and tissue viability.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired gallbladder emptying has been suggested as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Obese people have an increased incidence of gallstones, but there is no evidence of this in nonobese large people. This study was undertaken to determine if abnormal gallbladder motility is present in obese people. Fasting gallbladder volumes were determined using real-time ultrasound in 18 morbidly obese subjects whose weights were in a steady state [45 kg (100 lb) over ideal weight or twice expected weight for age and height; 9 males, 9 females], 18 age- and sex-matched volunteers of average size, and 18 nonobese large normal males (9 tall, 9 muscular). Gallbladder emptying studies with 99mtechnetium-diisopropyliminodiacetic acid were performed using 200 ml of 10% cream as a stimulus. The small-volume liquid fatty meal contained 113indium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to control for differences in gastric emptying in obesity. The gallbladder emptying rate in large people, both obese and nonobese, was less than that in normals of average size (p = 0.05). Fasting gallbladder volumes in large people were: obese, 41 ml (37-66 ml) (median; 95% confidence limits); nonobese large normal, 40 ml (27-43 ml). These values were greater than in normals of average size [17 ml (14-21 ml) (p = 0.03)]. Postprandial gallbladder volumes were also greater in large people: obese, 15 ml (8-23 ml); nonobese large normal, 20 ml (13-23 ml) compared with 2 ml (1-5 ml) in normals of average size (p less than 0.05). There were no differences between obese and nonobese large people. There were no differences in gastric emptying rates or in cholecystokinin, gastrin, motilin, and secretin release between obese and normal subjects. Gallbladder volume is crudely proportional to body size. Although fasting and postprandial volumes are greater in obesity, this is also present in nonobese, relatively size-matched controls. These data do not support a role for impaired gallbladder emptying in gallstone formation in obese patients whose weights are in a steady state.\r"

Therefore, a 6-wk, double-blind, crossover study was designed to test the ability of rifampin to relieve pruritus in children with chronic cholestasis. Rifampin proved effective in alleviating pruritus in all five children tested compared with a placebo-treated group. After the 6-wk study period, rifampin was continued for 6 mo, and its effectiveness was maintained. No complications resulted from rifampin use. This study and a similar study in older patients with primary biliary cirrhosis suggest that a highly effective form of therapy is available for treatment of severe pruritus in patients with chronic cholestasis. These patients must be carefully selected and frequently monitored.\r"

Recent data from in vitro studies suggest that intracellular expression and distribution of the three polypeptides may be variable. These observations in artificial expression systems prompted this analysis of the occurrence and distribution of the three hepatitis B surface proteins in the liver tissue of substantial viremic (hepatitis B virus DNA- and hepatitis B e antigen-positive) and low-viremic or nonviremic (hepatitis B virus DNA-negative, anti-hepatitis B e antigen-positive) carriers by specific monoclonal antibodies against large, middle, and small proteins. Patients with an active form of viral replication showed a prevalence of middle and small hepatitis B surface proteins in the liver. In nonviremic carriers, the large hepatitis B surface protein was the predominant intrahepatic antigen, a finding that was confirmed at the ultrastructural level by staining of the entire filaments of the viral envelope material in ground glass hepatocytes. The present data are thus consistent with observations in hepatitis B virus-transgenic mice and in transfected cell systems, suggesting that the different patterns of the envelope proteins in the liver may be due to different processing at the translational level.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrophobic bile acids have been shown to be hepatotoxic, whereas treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, a hydrophilic bile acid, has improved liver function indices in patients with chronic liver disease. Taurine administration has also been suggested to be useful for chronic hepatitis, taurine-conjugated bile acids being more hydrophilic than glycine-conjugated bile acids. To determine if taurine and ursodeoxycholic acid are beneficial and if their effects are additive, a double-blind, randomized trial was designed comparing the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid, taurine, and a combination of the two on indices of liver injury in 24 patients with chronic hepatitis. They were assigned at random to two of the four following treatments: ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day), taurine (1.5 g/day), ursodeoxycholic acid plus taurine (600 mg + 1.5 g/day) or placebo, given in two successive cycles of 2 mo each, according to a balanced incomplete-block design. Ursodeoxycholic acid became the predominant biliary bile acid when administered alone or in combination with taurine, and taurine conjugate levels increased during taurine administration. Ursodeoxycholic acid reduced aspartate aminotransferase (35%), alanine aminotransferase (33%), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (41%), whereas taurine alone did not. The addition of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid produced only minor changes in the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid alone. Results were confirmed by the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid, in a successive open phase of the study, to the entire patient population, which was large enough for different subsets of patients to be compared. Serum bile acids were measured at entry and during the open phase: primary bile acids did not change, whereas ursodeoxycholic acid levels increased from trace amounts to very high levels, especially in patients with more severe histological disease. It is concluded that ursodeoxycholic acid, but not taurine, improves enzymatic indices of liver injury in chronic hepatitis.\r"

Such elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels may be difficult to interpret in patients being screened for malignancy or in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening programs. This rare genetic condition seems benign, with no discernable disease or functional abnormality noted in follow-up over a 6-mo period.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred forty-two patients with active colonic or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were included in a multicenter prospective study. Data collection included 28 clinical, biological, and endoscopic items; the latter were recorded according to a standardized colonoscopic protocol; a previously validated endoscopic index of severity was calculated. Oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg body wt per day) was started and maintained until clinical remission and for at least 3 and at most 7 wk. A second clinical biological and endoscopic evaluation was then performed. At initial colonoscopy, mucosal lesions were, by decreasing order of frequency, superficial ulcerations, deep ulcerations, mucosal edema, erythema, pseudopolyps, aphthoid ulcers, ulcerated stenosis, and nonulcerated stenosis (93%, 74%, 48%, 44%, 41%, 35%, 10%, 8%, and 2% of cases, respectively). No correlation was found between the clinical activity index and any of the endoscopical data (lesion frequency and surface, endoscopic severity index). Ninety-two percent of patients underwent clinical remission within 7 wk of treatment. None of the 28 clinical biological and endoscopical items collected just before treatment could predict clinical response to steroids. Only 38 of the 131 patients in clinical remission were also in endoscopic remission. In conclusion, (a) the description and severity of colonoscopic lesions in active Crohn's disease have been quantified; (b) no correlation exists between clinical severity and nature, surface, or severity of endoscopic lesions; (c) Oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg body wt per day) induces a clinical remission in 92% of patients within 7 wk; (d) resistance to steroids cannot be predicted from the data collected before treatment onset; and (e) only 29% of patients in clinical remission also achieve endoscopic remission.\r"

In this study, in vitro retrograde tracing methods have been used on fresh human colon to determine the projection pathways of the enteric nerves and, in particular, those containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, one of the most abundant and potent of the gut neuropeptides. Two components of the submucous plexus were identified, the inner one projecting to the lamina propria, and the outer to the circular muscle. The lengths of projections within the submucous plexus were up to 5-14 mm in all directions. Myenteric ganglion cells projected to both longitudinal and circular muscles, for distances of up to only 5 mm. The subpopulation of nerves containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide arose mainly from the submucous plexus and projected up to 6.5 mm anally, 5 mm orally, and 14 mm within the submucous layer to the mucosa or circular muscle. These findings provide entirely new data on the neuroanatomy of the human colon and may help in the understanding of the neural control of colonic secretion and motility.\r"

The aim of this study was to detect epidermal growth factor in amniotic fluid and to study its uptake and transfer across the epithelium of fetal rat small intestine. Anesthetized 20-day gestation rats underwent caesarean section. Three fetuses were exteriorized, their abdomens were opened, and ligated loops of proximal and distal small intestine were infused with 100 micrograms epidermal growth factor. Infused segments were removed 30 min later and processed for electron microscopy, and tissue was embedded in LR gold resin. Sections were treated with rabbit anti-rat epidermal growth factor antibody, followed by 5 nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin before staining. Epidermal growth factor was measured in amniotic fluid by radioimmunoassay. In the proximal and distal small intestine epidermal growth factor was found membrane-associated along the luminal surface of microvilli, within apical invaginations and endosomal compartments, free from the membrane in multivesicular bodies, within large clear vesicles, basal vesicles and in association with the basolateral membrane and beyond. Epidermal growth factor was found in amniotic fluid at a concentration of 0.38 +/- 0.07 (SD) ng/ml. This study shows that epidermal growth factor is present in amniotic fluid and is transported across the epithelium of fetal rats by an endocytotic process in both the upper and lower small intestine. It is likely that amniotic fluid epidermal growth factor plays a part in intestinal mucosal development, and may be active systemically after transepithelial passage in utero.\r"

Short-term cultures consisted mainly of colonies composed of small polygonal cells, 70%-90% of which stained positive for immunoreactive gastrin. Cultures exhibited limited growth but viability remained high for 2-3 wk. Culture medium contained component I, and gastrin 34, 17, and 14. With time the major C-terminal gastrin species in medium changed from gastrin 17 at 3 days to gastrin 34 at 5 wk. Extracts of cultured cells contained gastrin 34, 17, and 14; gastrin 17 was the major form detected at all times. Ultrastructurally, cultured tumor cells retained morphological integrity for several weeks; however, with time changes in the appearance of the secretory granules accompanied by evidence of cellular retrodifferentiation were gradually observed. Secretin, gastrin-releasing peptide, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and phorbol, 12-myristate, 13-acetate stimulated the release of gastrin from cultured cells in a time-dependent fashion. Secretin, bombesin, gastrin-releasing peptide, L-tryptophan, and ethylamine stimulated gastrin release in a dose-dependent fashion. Somatostatin 14 inhibited secretin, bombesin, and gastrin-releasing peptide stimulated gastrin release but did not alter basal release. Cultured cells demonstrated de novo gastrin synthesis, evidenced by their ability to incorporate radiolabeled amino acids into immunoadsorbable gastrinlike material. Primary cultures of gastrin-containing tumor cells free from stromal contamination offer unique advantages for studies of factors that regulate the synthesis and secretion of gastrin and may prove of potential value for studies on cell differentiation and growth.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid from 28 primary gastric adenocarcinomas were analyzed for point mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras protooncogenes using polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction methodology. Twelve tumors were located at the gastroesophageal junction or cardia, and 16 in the body or antrum. Mutated ras genes were detected in 2 of 28 tumors for an overall incidence of 7%. The mutations occurred in codon 61 of the N-ras gene in a proximal gastric cancer and in codon 12 of the Ki-ras gene in a distal gastric cancer. These data indicate that mutations in ras genes are an uncommon event in primary gastric cancers and that there is no meaningful difference in the incidence of ras mutations in proximal and distal stomach cancers.\r"

To study the capacity of hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid to induce membrane expression of either hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B core antigen in vitro, we assessed transfected rat fibroblast cell lines by indirect immunofluorescence. Rat fibroblasts were transfected with plasmid vectors containing the natural promoters, native enhancer, and uninterrupted sequences of either the Pre S/S gene or core gene. Resulting cell lines produced hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen/hepatitis B e antigen, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry showed that hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen were expressed in a granular pattern in the surface membrane of transfected cells. We conclude that surface membrane expression of both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen is an intrinsic consequence of expression of either the Pre S/S or core gene.\r"

  ".W": "In genetic hemochromatosis, metabolic studies have demonstrated inappropriately increased iron absorption by cells of the duodenal mucosa. It is not clear whether this reflects an intrinsic abnormality of iron homeostasis at this site or is a consequence of a more generalized defect in cellular iron metabolism particularly involving the liver. We have previously used the expression of iron-related proteins as markers of iron homeostasis and have demonstrated normal regulation of the transferrin receptor and ferritin in the liver in this condition. In the present study we used immunohistochemical techniques to study transferrin-receptor expression in the gastrointestinal epithelium in normal subjects and patients with iron overload. In untreated genetic hemochromatosis and normal subjects, villus epithelial cells expressed receptor in the basolateral, subnuclear region. In contrast, in patients with secondary iron overload, receptor staining was absent in villus epithelial cells. The cells in the duodenal crypts showed intense staining for the transferrin receptor in all subjects investigated, a finding consistent with the known behavior of this receptor in proliferating cells. Given that body iron stores in both types of iron overload were comparable, these findings indicating a failure of down-regulation of the villus enterocyte transferrin receptor in genetic hemochromatosis may reflect the presence of a regulatory defect associated with the inability to control iron absorption in this condition.\r"

Both investigations were double blind randomised comparisons using ranitidine 300 mg with either different meal times or ad libitum snacks after an evening meal. Meals taken after drug administration nearly abolished measurable antisectory effects. Median 24 hour pH was 1.3 on placebo, 2.6 when ranitidine was administered after the evening meal and 1.9 when administered before the evening meal. Snacks taken after evening dosing with ranitidine also significantly decreased pharmacodynamic efficacy. During placebo, median night-time pH was 1.3 without snacks and 1.4 with snacks. pH rose to 5.9 during ranitidine treatment when snacks were forbidden but was only 3.1 when snacks were allowed. These findings could be of therapeutic importance and should rationalise dietary advise to patients receiving H2 blockers. The timing of drug administration can be adjusted according to individual life styles.\r"

Endoscopy was performed when ulcer symptoms recurred and at the end of the 25 week trial period. In the acyclovir group the cumulated relapse rate was 63% compared with 56% in the placebo group (NS).

  ".W": "Intestinal secretion rates of albumin, hyaluronan, and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-micro) were determined under basal conditions and after gliadin challenge of coeliac patients and healthy controls by the use of a jejunal perfusion technique. A new tube system was used where a jejunal segment is isolated between balloons and then perfused with a balanced salt solution. Under basal conditions the secretion rate of albumin was similar in the patients and controls while the secretion rate of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan, a high molecular weight connective tissue component, was increased more than two times in coeliac patients. Beta 2-micro was secreted in on average three-fold rates in coeliacs compared with controls. All three substances were secreted at a higher rate in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease defined by morphological damage in small bowel biopsies. The concentrations in jejunal perfusion fluids relative to serum levels in the coeliac patients were for albumin 0.0007, beta 2-micro 0.10, and for hyaluronan 1.94. Challenge with a single dose of gliadin into the jejunal segment gave within 60 min a significant, about two-fold, increase of the secretion rates of all three measured substances. The appearance of hyaluronan could reflect a gliadin induced mucosal oedema with an enhanced leakage from the interstitial/lymph fluid, rich in this glycosaminoglycan. The observed parallel increases in the jejunal secretion of albumin and beta 2-micro after gliadin challenge are best explained by a similar mechanism.\r"

We also compared propranolol therapy to long-term injection sclerotherapy. One hundred and eight patients, in whom the original variceal hemorrhage stopped spontaneously (before diagnostic endoscopy) and without sclerotherapy or surgical intervention, were included. All were Pugh grade A or B; 55% had alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients were chosen randomly to receive oral propranolol (in a dosage to reduce resting pulse rate by 25%) or to undergo long-term injection sclerotherapy. In both groups, episodes of repeat bleeding that did not stop spontaneously were managed with sclerotherapy. Patients considered to have failed propranolol therapy were treated with long-term sclerotherapy. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 64 mo. In the propranolol group, 28 (54%) of the 52 patients had repeat bleeding from varices with a total of 57 episodes; 14 received long-term sclerotherapy. In the sclerotherapy group, 25 (45%) of the 56 patients had repeat bleeding, with a total of 40 episodes (p less than 0.20). On an intention-to-treat basis, the risk of bleeding expressed per patient-month of follow-up was similar for the two groups, at 0.05 and 0.037, respectively. Survival as assessed by cumulative life analysis was also similar, with 55% and 66% alive at 3 yr (p less than 0.40). Stepwise regression analysis of possible factors predicting further bleeding in patients taking propranolol selected only two variables--the pretreatment pulse rate and the extent of pulse-rate reduction in response to propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Criteria for spontaneous bacterial empyema included positive pleural fluid culture or polymorphonuclear cell concentration greater than 500 cells/mm3, evidence of pleural effusion before an infectious episode and transudate characteristics during infection. In five cases, spontaneous bacterial empyema was culture-negative and was associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascitic fluid was culture-negative in two of these cases and culture-positive in three. Blood cultures were negative in all five of these cases. In six cases spontaneous bacterial empyema was culture-positive (Escherichia coli in four, Klebsiella pneumoniae in one and Clostridium perfringens in one). Four of these patients had the same organism in ascites; one had culture-negative spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and one had no infection of ascites. Blood cultures were positive in four of these patients; three died. Death was more frequent in patients with positive cultures than in those with negative ones (p less than 0.05). Patients with hydrothorax are prone to spontaneous bacterial empyema. This infection probably occurs through hematogenous seeding, but transfer of infected ascites from the abdominal cavity through the diaphragm cannot be excluded. Patients with spontaneous bacterial empyema may be asymptomatic or may be seen with fever, chills and dyspnea. Spontaneous bacterial empyema must be differentiated from parapneumonic empyemas. The presence of pleural effusion before the infectious episode, fluid characteristics and the organisms isolated are the clues for differential diagnosis. Treatment includes antibiotics; chest tube insertion probably is not necessary.\r"

  ".U": "90185576\r", 
  ".W": "The role of cytokeratin filaments in the function of hepatocytes was investigated using a nickel-treated hepatocyte in vitro model. Cytokeratin intermediate filaments were selectively dissociated from the cell cortex by nickel treatment. Cytokeratins and ubiquitin were observed using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Hepatocytic function was assessed by visualizing uptake, transhepatic transport and secretion of fluorescein diacetate and horseradish peroxidase into the bile canaliculi. In control primary cultures, most of the bile canaliculi were surrounded by an inner layer of actin filaments and an outer pericanalicular sheath of cytokeratin filaments and microtubules. The cytoplasmic distribution of ubiquitin was diffuse and particulate. After treatment with NiCl2 (150 micrograms/ml) for 24 hr, the cytokeratin filaments and desmoplakin became focally detached from the cell cortex and retracted to form an aggregate around the nucleus. These aggregates were associated with intense ubiquitin immunoreactivity. Only a few attachments of the cytokeratin filaments to the cell cortex remained. F-actin remained attached to the cell cortex in the areas where the cytokeratin filaments had become detached. The pericanalicular sheath of cytokeratin filaments and the bile canaliculi disappeared and actin was dispersed over the entire cell periphery. Fluorescein diacetate secretion and horseradish peroxidase uptake were almost completely absent in the hepatocytes treated with nickel. The effects of nickel persisted 24 hr after its removal from the medium. It is concluded that cytokeratin intermediate filaments play a critical role in the formation of the bile canaliculus, secretion of fluorescein diacetate and uptake of horseradish peroxidase. Further, our study indicates that cytokeratin ubiquitination occurs during collapse and aggregation of the cytokeratin filaments. The formation of cytokeratin-ubiquitin conjugates during aggregation suggests a role of ubiquitin in the control of cytokeratin organization in hepatocytes in the response to cell stress.\r"

  ".W": "The unweighting model is a unique whole animal model that will permit the future delineation of the mechanism(s) by which gravity maintains contractile mass in postural (slow-twitch) skeletal muscle. Since the origination of the model of rodent hindlimb unweighting almost one decade ago, about half of the 59 refereed articles in which this model was utilized have been published in the Journal of Applied Physiology. Thus the purpose of this review is to provide, for those researchers with an interest in the hindlimb unweighting model, a summation of the data derived from this model to data and hopefully to stimulate research interest in aspects of the model for which data are lacking. The stress response of the animal to hindlimb unweighting is transient, minimal in magnitude, and somewhat variable. After 1 wk of unweighting, the animal exhibits no chronic signs of stress. The atrophy of the soleus muscle, a predominantly slow-twitch muscle, is emphasized because unweighting preferentially affects it compared with other calf muscles, which are mainly fast-twitch muscles. The review considers the following information about the unweighted soleus muscle: electromyogram activity, amount and type of protein lost, capillarization, oxidative capacity, glycolytic enzyme activities, fiber cross section, contractile properties, glucose uptake, sensitivity to insulin, protein synthesis and degradation rates, glucocorticoid receptor numbers, responses of specific mRNAs, and changes in metabolite concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on supraglottic and total pulmonary resistance were determined in 10 healthy premature infants (postconceptional age 34 +/- 2 wk, weight at study 1,628 +/- 250 g). Nasal airflow was measured with a mask pneumotachograph, and pressures in the esophagus and oropharynx were measured with a 5-Fr Millar or fluid-filled catheter. Nasal CPAP between 0 and 5 cmH2O correlated well with oropharyngeal pressure (r = 0.94). Total supraglottic resistance, total pulmonary resistance, and supraglottic resistance in inspiration and expiration were measured on increasing CPAP. Total supraglottic resistance decreased from 46 +/- 29 to 17 +/- 16 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.005) between 0 and 5 cmH2O CPAP, and a delay in return of resistance to control values was seen as CPAP was reciprocally decreased to 0. CPAP produced a decrease in supraglottic resistance in both inspiration and expiration, from 41 +/- 26 to 14 +/- 9 and from 33 +/- 17 to 10 +/- 6 cmH2O.l-1.s, respectively (P less than 0.01). Total pulmonary resistance also decreased from 161 +/- 40 to 95 +/- 24 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.01) between 0 and 5 cmH2O CPAP. The decrease in total supraglottic resistance in these infants accounted for 60% of the change in total pulmonary resistance, which occurred on CPAP of 5 cmH2O. We speculate that CPAP may decrease supraglottic resistance directly through mechanical splinting of the airway. This effect of CPAP may be the primary mechanism by which this form of therapy reduces apnea with an obstructive component in premature infants.\r"

After 3 days on a controlled diet (so that the proportions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat were identical), subjects ran on a treadmill at a velocity requiring an O2 consumption of approximately 65% of maximal. They ran a total \"distance\" of 15.5 km with a range in performance time of 90-101 min. Plasma glycerol, glucose, free fatty acids, and selected hormones (catecholamines, growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon) were measured throughout and after the run by sampling from an indwelling venous catheter, and glycogen utilization was calculated from pre- and postexercise needle biopsies of vastus lateralis. Exercise protein catabolism was estimated from 24-h urinary urea nitrogen excretion over the test day and a nonexercise day. The males were found to have significantly higher respiratory exchange ratios (mean 0.94 vs. 0.87), greater muscle glycogen utilization (by 25%), and greater urea nitrogen excretion (by 30%) than the females. No gender differences were evident in the hormonal response to the exercise with the exception of a lower insulin concentration and a higher epinephrine concentration in the males. We conclude that, during moderate-intensity long-duration exercise, females demonstrate greater lipid utilization and less carbohydrate and protein metabolism than equally trained and nourished males.\r"

  ".W": "To examine how molecular charge affects the transfer of molecules across the alveolar-capillary barrier, we prepared the following dextrans of equivalent molecular size (mol wt 10,000) but varying molecular charge: neutral dextran, cationic DEAE dextran, and anionic dextran sulfate. These were labeled with 99mTc. The lungs of three groups of anesthetized rabbits were insufflated with dextran aerosols, with six rabbits receiving each type, and the half-time pulmonary clearance (t1/2) was measured. Control t1/2's (95% confidence limits) were 95 (74-120), 227 (192-268), and 291 (246-345) min for neutral, cationic, and anionic dextrans, respectively. One week later, when the same animals were restudied 4 h after 3 micrograms/kg iv endotoxin, t1/2's were 102 (75-139), 167 (149-187), and 126 (102-154) min, respectively. After 30 min during this repeat study, animals were ventilated with 20 breaths of cigarette smoke, which acutely increased the clearance rate to 34 (26-46), 25 (20-31), and 13 (7-24) min, respectively. Mean carboxyhemoglobin levels were not significantly different in the three groups: 13.6, 12.7, and 11.1%, respectively. These results demonstrated that neutral dextrans showed the same clearance rate before and after endotoxin, whereas the charged dextrans had a significantly faster clearance after endotoxin. After smoke exposure the anionic dextran left the lung more rapidly than the neutral dextran. Thus molecular charge affects solute transfer across the alveolar-capillary barrier in both normal and injured lungs, and an effect of endotoxin on the lung can be detected with charged dextrans but not with neutral dextran.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of endothelin (ET) on transmembrane potential and isometric force were studied in ferret bronchial and tracheal smooth muscles. At rest, the muscle cells were electrically and mechanically quiescent. The mean resting potential for the bronchial cells was -70 +/- 1 mV (n = 25 cells/8 ferrets), and that of the tracheal cells was -60 +/- 1 mV (n = 7 cells/2 ferrets). ET depolarized and contracted both types of muscle cells in a concentration-dependent manner. At 1 nM ET, the bronchial muscle cells were significantly depolarized with concomitant force generation. In contrast, greater than 30 nM ET was required for the tracheal muscle cells to respond. The bronchial cells were further depolarized by 10 and 100 nM ET with electrical slow-wave activity present. The calcium channel antagonist verapamil substantially inhibited the contractions produced by 100 nM ET and abolished the slow-wave activity without affecting the base-line depolarization. Pretreatment of the bronchial muscle with 30 microM indomethacin did not affect the ET-induced contraction. These results suggest that ET modulates airway smooth muscle tone by direct activation and/or depolarization-induced activation of sarcolemmal calcium channels.\r"

Conservative treatment by splintage in abduction led to complete stability in all hips in from three to 13 weeks. Immediately after reduction, interposed soft tissue caused lateralisation of the femoral head, but this progressively disappeared, and the initially smaller femoral head on the dislocated side regained normal size. Ultrasonic evaluation of the hip in late CDH is a valuable and safe tool; it reduces the need for radiographic examination and improves treatment by visualising the actual pathology. The more frequent use of ultrasound can reduce the need for open reduction in the age group that we studied.\r"

We report here the results of a multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficiency of Sildimac for treatment of full-thickness burn wounds.

The immediate goal of the studies reviewed herein is to lay the foundation in transplant immunobiology for the clinical exploitation of composite tissue allografts. The objective of these continuing studies is to induce permanent acceptance of composite tissue allografts. The value of such grafts lies in their potential for complete functional and cosmetic restoration in the surgical reconstruction of tissue after full-thickness burn injury. The initial results of basic experiments with cyclosporine are extremely encouraging in regard to the clinical potential for integumentary/musculoskeletal grafts in reconstructive allotransplantation.\r"

To determine if this represents a more generalized abnormality in beta adrenoceptor response, we studied beta adrenergic-mediated vasodilation in hand veins of borderline hypertensive subjects and controls. Subjects received a 5-d diet containing high Na/low potassium (K), high Na/high K, or low Na/high K. Venous distension, as evaluated by a linear variable differential transformer, was measured in relation to infusion of phenylephrine followed by isoproterenol and nitroglycerin. On both the high Na/high K and high Na/low K diets, hypertensive subjects had significantly decreased isoproterenol-mediated vasodilation (47% decrease, P less than 0.01 and 36% decrease, P less than 0.01, respectively). On the low Na/high K diet, isoproterenol-mediated vasodilation in hypertensive subjects increased 41% (P less than 0.01) to a level not different from controls. Nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation was not different in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, nor was it altered with Na intake. Phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive groups. Venous beta-adrenergic response correlated with lymphocyte beta adrenoceptor density in normotensive (r = 0.53, P less than 0.005) but not hypertensive subjects. This study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic responsiveness is selectively reduced in peripheral veins of borderline hypertensive subjects, and this is corrected by a low Na diet. In view of our previous findings of reduced lymphocyte beta-adrenergic responsiveness in borderline hypertension, these studies suggest a generalized defect of beta adrenoceptor responsiveness in human hypertension. Further, dietary Na may play an important role in regulating this abnormality.\r"

This loss of expression is attributed to heterogeneous defects in the common beta subunit shared by these glycoproteins. Here we demonstrate that expression of the LFA-1 alpha beta heterodimer in EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cells from LAD patients can be recovered after transfection with the beta subunit cDNA contained in an EBV-based vector. Four patients with differing severities of LAD comprising three distinct classes of mutations were studied. Flow cytometry analysis of stably transfected patient cells revealed near normal levels of expression of both the alpha and beta chains of LFA-1, and immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that fully processed alpha and beta chains were being expressed at the cell surface. In addition, Northern analysis of mRNA expression also demonstrated that the transfected LAD patient cells were expressing high quantities of exogenous beta subunit mRNA. Functional studies such as homotypic adhesion and adhesion to a purified counterreceptor for LFA-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, demonstrated that LFA-1 function had been restored in the stably transfected LAD patient cell lines. These studies unequivocally show that the defect in cells from patients with LAD is in the leukocyte integrin beta subunit.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate developmental and physiological signals that may influence expression of the dihydropyridine-sensitive \"slow\" Ca2+ channel, we analyzed dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) mRNA abundance in mouse skeletal muscle. Using synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR, a 6.5 kb DHPR transcript was identified in postnatal skeletal muscle and differentiated C2 or BC3H1 myocytes, but not cardiac muscle or brain. DHPR gene expression was reversibly suppressed by 0.4 nM transforming growth factor beta-1 or by transfection with a mutant c-H-ras allele, nominal inhibitors of myogenesis that block the appearance of slow channels and DHPR. In contrast, both BC3H1 and C2 myocytes containing the activated ras vector expressed the gene encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor delta subunit, demonstrating that not all muscle-specific genes are extinguished by ras. Denervation stimulated DHPR gene expression less than 0.6-fold, despite 8-fold upregulation of delta-subunit mRNA and reciprocal effects on the skeletal and cardiac alpha-actin genes. Thus, DHPR gene induction is prevented by inhibitors of other muscle-specific genes, whereas, at most, relatively small changes in DHPR mRNA abundance occur during adaptation to denervation.\r"

  ".U": "90187082\r", 
  ".W": "Binding of the bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) of granulocytes to Escherichia coli promptly produces several discrete outer envelope alterations and growth arrest without major impairment of bacterial structure or biosynthetic capabilities, raising the question whether these early effects of BPI are sufficient to cause bacterial death. In this study, the bactericidal action of BPI was examined more closely. We have found that bovine or human serum albumin blocks bacterial killing without preventing BPI binding or an increase in outer membrane permeability. Moreover, addition of serum albumin after BPI results in growth resumption without displacement of bound BPI and without (early) repair of the envelope alterations. These effects are opposite to those produced by Mg2+ (80 mM), which displaces greater than 85% of bound BPI and rapidly initiates outer envelope repair without restoration of bacterial growth. The extent of rescue by serum albumin depends on the time and pH of preincubation of BPI with E. coli: e.g., for E. coli J5 treated with human BPI, t1/2 = 79 min at pH 7.4 and 10 min at pH 6.0. The serum albumin effects on BPI action are the same in wild-type E. coli and in a mutant strain lacking an activatable phospholipase, indicating that serum albumin does not act by sequestering membrane-damaging products of bacterial phospholipid hydrolysis. The progression from reversible to irreversible growth arrest, revealed by the subsequent addition of serum albumin at different times, is paralleled by a decrease in amino acid uptake and an increase in the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane to o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside. These findings demonstrate at least two stages in the action of BPI: (a) an early, reversible, sublethal stage in which BPI has effects on the outer envelope and causes growth arrest, and (b) time- and pH-dependent progression to a lethal stage, apparently involving cytoplasmic membrane damage, possibly caused by penetration of a small subpopulation of BPI.\r"

DC are bone marrow-derived cells with an extraordinarily potent ability to promote the immunological activity of T lymphocytes. Unfortunately, since DC constitute less than 0.5% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and die within a few days of their isolation, they are not readily accessible to study. We report here that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine with well-recognized effects on granulocyte and macrophage maturation, profoundly affects the morphology and viability of DC isolated from peripheral blood. GM-CSF not only promotes DC survival but also induces DC differentiation to mobile, reversibly adherent cells with long-branched projections. DC cultured in GM-CSF survive for up to 6 wk and retain their ability to stimulate the proliferation of T cells in allogeneic and autologous mixed leukocyte reactions.\r"

The relative molar amount of secreted amylin was estimated to be 25-37% that of insulin. Treatment with a borderline diabetogenic dose of streptozotocin reduced amylin response without significantly changing the insulin response. A severely diabetogenic dose of streptozotocin totally abolished amylin release and markedly reduced insulin release. The selective impairment of amylin secretion in streptozotocin-treated rats could represent an early manifestation of beta-cell depletion or injury.\r"

A simple technique was developed which uses an unstandardised suspension of a single K1 specific bacteriophage applied with a 1 mm wire loop to bacteria streaked on to cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) medium. The technique correctly identified all 99 known K1 strains tested, including 14 strains negative with the serological method. Among 71 clinical isolates from urinary tract infections, the single bacteriophage method distinguished 30 K1 strains from 41 strains without this antigen. Suspensions of the bacteriophage were shown to remain fully active for at least two years when stored at 4 degrees C. It is concluded that this technique required so little in materials, time, or equipment that it could be routinely used in most laboratories.\r"

Marrow aspirate and trephine collagenase digest specimens from individual sites were each tested with the monoclonal antibody UJ13A and with a pool of three related antibodies. The results were compared with morphological assessment of conventionally stained aspirates and trephine specimens taken at the same time. Immunostaining suggested the presence of tumour in seven of 18 staging procedures in which conventional techniques had shown infiltration. Tumour infiltration was also suggested in four of 10 staging procedures with suspicious trephine specimens, but in none of three with relatively innocent histological and cytological features. Immunological investigation provides no additional information about the presence of infiltration if conventional microscopy has shown definite tumour. When histological appearances are suspicious, immunostaining of stored aspirate smears or collagenase digest specimens may provide evidence of infiltration. There are insufficient data to comment on the value of immunostaining when conventional techniques reveal \"normal\" marrow, but the impression gained from this study is that immunostaining has a limited role in the detection of metastatic neuroblastoma, which yet remains to be defined.\r"

In this study we show that the action spectrum of lupus erythematosus reaches into the UVA region. A total of 128 patients with lupus erythematosus underwent phototesting with the use of polychromatic UVB and long-wave UVA. Subsets of the disease consisted of discoid lupus erythematosus (n = 86), subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (n = 22), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 20). Skin lesions clinically and histologically compatible with lupus erythematosus were induced in 64% of patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, 42% of patients with discoid lupus erythematosus, and 25% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The action spectrum of the induced lesions was within the UVB range in 33% of patients, in the UVA range in 14%, and in the UVB and UVA range in 53%. In positive test reactions patchy dark erythema and urticarial plaques developed within a few days. In some patients typical discoid lesions persisted for months.\r"

Histologically, atypical lymphocytes in the dermis and Pautrier's microabscesses are often present in skin biopsy specimens. Immunologic findings that support a diagnosis of Sezary syndrome include a predominance of CD4+ lymphocytes in both skin biopsy specimens and peripheral blood. Cytogenetic studies that demonstrate aneuploidy and DNA probe analysis that shows gene rearrangement for the beta-subunit of the T cell receptor are the latest, most sensitive, and specific methods for identifying the clonal nature of the disease. Various staging systems are used. We review the various treatments for Sezary syndrome, including the newer, biologically based investigational therapies, (e.g., antithymocyte globulin, monoclonal antibodies and other immunostimulants, retinoids, cyclosporine, interferon, and extracorporeal photopheresis). Extracorporeal photopheresis and some chemotherapeutic agents appear to produce the best results in terms of response and remission duration with minimal toxicity. However, more multicenter controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the most effective single or combined therapeutic regimen.\r"

On the basis of the results in frozen sections, 12 inflammatory T cell diseases, 14 T cell lymphomas and pseudolymphomas, and 10 B cell lymphomas and pseudolymphomas were identified. In addition, two cases of specific skin infiltrates of Hodgkin's disease have been examined. Among T cell markers, the greatest sensitivity was exhibited by UCHL1, which stained all but one specimen of T cell infiltrate; it was negative in one specimen of mycosis fungoides that progressed into a T-immunoblastic lymphoma. The combined use of MB-2, LN-2, and 4KB5 identified all B cell proliferations. LN-1 marked germinal centers in all cases of follicular lymphoma and pseudolymphoma. Ber-H2 stained the Reed-Sternberg cells in both cases of Hodgkin's disease and the large cells in the histiocytic type of lymphomatoid papulosis. Mac-387 and anti-S-100 protein antibody recognized macrophages and T-zone histiocytes (Langerhans cells and interdigitating cells), respectively. A panel of antibodies reactive in routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections is proposed that facilitates the identification of most B and T cell infiltrates in the skin.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred three patients with acne vulgaris were randomly designated to receive either a topical formulation of erythromycin plus zinc or a topical solution of 1% clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin-T). The patients treated themselves twice daily and were examined at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after the start of therapy. By week 6 the overall severity grade was consistently lower and the percent reduction of severity, papules, pustules, and total comedones was higher in the erythromycin-zinc-treated group than in the clindamycin-treated group. In the 92 patients who completed this study (48 receiving erythromycin-zinc and 44 receiving clindamycin), no serious topical or systemic side effects were reported. Two patients, one from each treatment group, suffered mild irritation. One patient was withdrawn from the erythromycin-zinc-treated group. Results of patch tests were negative. The superiority of the erythromycin-zinc formulation may be due to the increased (4%) erythromycin concentration and/or the ability of 1.2% zinc acetate to enhance the product's activity.\r"

It is caused by a weakly reactive gram-negative bacillus, which can be easily demonstrated in tissue sections with the Warthin-Starry stain. Bacillary angiomatosis usually responds readily to treatment with oral erythromycin, 250 to 500 mg, taken four times a day for 2 weeks to 1 month. Because the skin is the most common site of involvement, it is important that the dermatologist recognize this unusual condition. It is essential that treatment be started as soon as possible because deaths may result from visceral and mucosal involvement. The clinical, histologic, and microbiologic aspects of bacillary angiomatosis are discussed and depicted in detail and speculations regarding the pathogenesis are rendered.\r"

The tumescent technique uses large volumes of a dilute anesthetic solution to produce swelling and firmness of targeted areas. This investigation examines the absorption pharmacokinetics of dilute solutions of lidocaine (0.1% or 0.05%) and epinephrine (1:1,000,000) in physiologic saline following infiltration into subcutaneous fat of liposuction surgery patients. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were measured repeatedly over more than 24 hours following the infiltration. Peak plasma lidocaine levels occurred 12-14 hours after beginning the infiltration. Clinical local anesthesia is apparent for up to 18 hours, obviating the need for postoperative analgesia. Dilution of lidocaine diminishes and delays the peak plasma lidocaine concentrations, thereby reducing potential toxicity. Liposuction reduces the total amount of lidocaine absorbed systemically, but does not dramatically reduce peak plasma lidocaine levels. A safe upper limit for lidocaine dosage using the tumescent technique is estimated to be 35 mg/kg. Infiltrating a large volume of dilute epinephrine assures diffusion throughout the entire targeted area while avoiding tachycardia and hypertension. The associated vasoconstriction is so complete that there is virtually no blood loss with liposuction. The tumescent technique can be used with general anesthesia or IV sedation. However, with appropriate instrumentation and surgical method, the tumescent technique permits liposuction of large volumes of fat totally by local anesthesia, without IV sedation or narcotic analgesia.\r"

The investigation compares self-reports of tooth grinding and related clinical variables for 151 cases of temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome (TMPDS) treated by a clinician who does not explicitly support the grinding theory of the etiology of TMPDS, and 139 healthy controls. Cases were no more likely than well controls to report ever-grinding, but were actually significantly less likely than well controls to report current grinding. They were also significantly more likely to report that a dentist had told them they ground. Findings suggest that studies using self-report, clinician-report of tooth grinding (or both) are methodologically inadequate for addressing the relationship between tooth grinding and TMPDS.\r"

  ".U": "90187562\r", 
  ".W": "Measurement of systolic wall thickening by sonomicrometry provides an accurate index of regional left ventricular function, but the trauma of crystal insertion limits its widespread clinical use. The first clinical application of a 10 MHz ultrasonic Doppler probe that can be either sutured or applied by suction to the epicardium and can measure wall thickening at any depth of the left ventricular wall is described. In 18 dogs, measurements obtained with the suction probe correlated well (r = 0.97) with those of a previously validated sutured probe. To assess clinical feasibility, the probe was applied to the epicardium of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Good quality wall thickening signals were obtained with no complications. Transmural left ventricular thickening fraction before bypass surgery was 34 +/- 3% (mean value +/- SE) at the mid-ventricular lateral wall, 33 +/- 4% at the anterior basal wall and 26 +/- 4% at the mid-ventricular posterior wall. Right ventricular thickening fraction averaged 25 +/- 3%. Endocardial thickening fraction tended to exceed epicardial thickening fraction, although the difference attained statistical significance (p less than 0.05) only at the anterior basal wall. On average, thickening fraction during the immediate postoperative period remained unchanged compared with the preoperative values, but a marked individual variability was observed, with 7 of 15 patients exhibiting a decrease and 8 an increase. Exteriorization of the wires attached to the sutured probe allowed continuous in situ monitoring of wall thickening in the postoperative period and subsequent removal of the probe. In six patients the crystal was left in place for 48 to 72 h after surgery and then removed without complications; good wall thickening signals were obtained for the entire period during which the probe was implanted. Thus, the Doppler probe is an accurate, atraumatic method for measuring right and left ventricular regional function. Transmural, endocardial and epicardial function can be mapped at various sites during surgery, and post-operatively one can monitor serial changes of regional function and assess the effects of cardioplegia and other therapeutic interventions. This technique should be useful for both investigative and clinical purposes.\r"

Oral combination therapy was initiated with quinidine gluconate (165 mg) plus mexiletine (150 mg) every 8 h. If ventricular premature complexes were not suppressed greater than or equal to 80% and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia greater than or equal to 90%, the dose was increased to a maximum of 330 mg of quinidine plus 200 mg of mexiletine. Quinidine monotherapy was initiated with 330 mg and escalated to a maximum of 660 mg every 8 h if criteria for effectiveness were not met. Combination quinidine-mexiletine therapy suppressed 80% of ventricular premature complexes in 13 of 14 patients and suppressed 100% of episodes of ventricular tachycardia in 6 of 8 patients (mean quinidine dose 200 +/- 70 mg; mean mexiletine dose 146 +/- 24 mg every 8 h). The mean effective trough quinidine and mexiletine concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.7 and 0.9 +/- 0.4 microgram/ml, respectively. Monotherapy was less effective; that is, greater than or equal to 80% suppression of ventricular premature complexes was observed in 5 of 15 patients and 100% suppression of ventricular tachycardia in 2 of 9 patients. The mean quinidine monotherapy dose was 462 +/- 155 mg every 8 h; the mean quinidine concentration was 1.8 +/- 0.8 microgram/ml.

After adjustment for the longer time associated with the 3 to 12 month period, the relative risk per unit time of early as compared with late mortality was 2.64. Risk factors for early mortality were different from those that predicted late mortality. Independent predictors of mortality between hospital discharge to 3 months after infarction were ST segment depression that persisted during hospitalization (p less than 0.0001), in-hospital reinfarction (p = 0.0006) and a history of congestive heart failure (p = 0.0255). Persistent ST depression and in-hospital reinfarction had neither a univariate nor an independent association with 3 to 12 month mortality.

Four subjects with suspected TDI-induced asthma and four mite-sensitive subjects with asthma who served as a comparison group were studied. NCA was measured in a multiwell, microchemotaxis chamber. Blood samples were collected, and FEV1 measurements were performed before challenge and at regular intervals during the subsequent 24 hours. Three of four workers clinically sensitive to TDI reacted to a subirritant TDI exposure. There was no increase in NCA during placebo challenges. NCA increased in the three TDI-sensitive workers during early and late asthmatic reactions in quantities proportional to the FEV1 decline. No increase in NCA was found during TDI exposures in the TDI-negative worker. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated the main NCA fraction eluted with macromolecules of an estimated molecular weight greater than 440,000 daltons. This characteristic is compatible with neutrophil chemotactic factor of basophil or mast cell origin. The kinetics of NCA release were similar in mite- and TDI-induced asthmatic reactions. A high correlation (r = 0.97; p = 0.0006) was obtained between the percent decrease in FEV1 during early asthmatic reactions and percent increase in NCA. These observations support the hypothesis that activation of mast cells or basophils is associated with TDI-induced early and late asthmatic reaction.\r"

Colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the concanavalin A-induced suppressor cell function from 16.2 +/- 4.6% to 39.0 +/- 10.7%, which was similar to healthy volunteers (41.1 +/- 3.5%). Furthermore, colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased serum IgE from 248 +/- 63 to 188 +/- 46 IU/ml. Colchicine had no significant effect on pulmonary function tests, the early phase reaction of antigen-induced bronchial inhalation challenge, and immediate skin test responses. Thus, colchicine has immunomodulatory effects that may perhaps have a mild benefit in the treatment of asthma.\r"

We performed this study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two other diagnostic tests, prolonged recording expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and measurement of bronchial responsiveness (provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PC20 methacholine]). Twenty-three patients with suspected cedar asthma participated in the study. The patients recorded PEFR during 2 weeks away from work and 3 weeks at work. PC20 was measured both at the end of the nonworking and working period. An obvious decrease in PEFR in 2 of 3 working weeks, when PEFRs of weekends or holidays were compared (by visual inspection of the PEFR recording), and a decrease in PC20 by more than a twofold dilution, when the patient returned to work, were considered as positive tests for cedar asthma. Plicatic acid challenge test was performed at the end of the study; 14 patients reacted, whereas nine patients did not. With the results of the plicatic acid challenge test as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of PEFR recordings were 86% and 89%; changes in PC20, 62% and 78%; and 93% and 45% for a positive clinical history.

Four weeks of administration of large doses (greater than 14 mg/day) of beta 2-agonists were well tolerated, elicited a significant decrease of corticosteroid consumption (p less than 0.01), and were associated with an improvement in pulmonary function (p less than 0.01), compared with run in or the placebo administration period. Mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were similar during all periods, and the variability between morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates was only slightly and nonsignificantly reduced during the period when salbutamol was administered subcutaneously. Both nebulized and subcutaneous salbutamol elicited similar metabolic and muscular side effects, but these untoward reactions never caused any patient to stop the treatment. Local infection at the injection site was observed in two of 10 patients with continuous subcutaneous infusion. Tachyphylaxis to beta 2-agonist, as measured by the reversibility of FEV1 to inhaled salbutamol 12 hours after the end of each period, did not occur. In conclusion, large doses of beta 2-agonist administered to patients with severe, chronic, and steroid-dependent asthma were able to improve respiratory function and to decrease corticosteroids requirements.\r"

Because nedocromil sodium has in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties, it was evaluated in a group of steroid-dependent patients with asthma to observe how well it might be tolerated and for evidence of any beneficial effects. In a double-blind, group-comparative study, 127 patients received nedocromil sodium and 61 received placebo, administered as two puffs of 2 mg, four times per day, for 12 weeks. Ten patients developed adverse reactions, seven receiving active drug and three patients receiving placebo. Two patients of each group withdrew because of worsening asthma. Despite selecting patients whose asthma was stable, when they were receiving established therapeutic regimens that included steroids and bronchodilators, it was found that diary-card symptom scores, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate values, and inhaled beta-agonist usage all demonstrated slight but significant benefit with addition of nedocromil sodium. It is concluded that the inhaled, anti-inflammatory agent, nedocromil sodium, may be added to asthma-treatment regimens with the reasonable expectation of further modest symptomatic benefit.\r"

One hundred twenty-four adolescent and adult patients with asthma and with chronic reversible obstructive airway disease were studied. All patients qualified with an FEV1 less than or equal to 80% of predicted (not receiving treatment) and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility in FEV1 or greater than or equal to 25% reversibility in FEF25-75% after inhaled isoproterenol. All patients were known to be able to take theophylline without unacceptable adverse effects. Theophylline was titrated for patients to receive, unblinded, theophylline serum concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. With subsequent randomization, 62 patients continued to receive theophylline and 62 patients started taking albuterol in the 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy portion of the study. Pulmonary function was measured during a pretreatment visit (unmedicated) and serial assessment was made starting just before the morning dose and continuing for 12 hours after the dose at the end of 1, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment. Both treatment groups exhibited statistically significant increases in FEV1 from the pretreatment visit to all times of observation at weeks 1, 6, and 12. The increases in FEV1 were not significantly different between albuterol and theophylline administration. There was no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilatory effect during 12 weeks in either treatment group. Only one patient in the study stopped treatment because of an adverse effect. This patient had tremor during albuterol administration. All other adverse events were tolerated or resolved during treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The protective efficacy of oral cetirizine, a selective and potent H1-receptor antagonist, against the immediate bronchoconstrictive response to allergen inhalation and exercise challenge was evaluated in 16 subjects with stable, predominantly mild asthma. The subjects underwent double-blind, crossover pretreatments in randomized order in two separate protocols with (1) three daily oral doses of 20 mg of cetirizine and placebo, followed by allergen inhalation, and (2) single oral doses of cetirizine (5, 10, and 20 mg), albuterol (4 mg), and placebo, followed by exercise with cold-air inhalation. Cetirizine failed to decrease bronchial sensitivity to inhaled allergen in eight of 10 subjects. Neither cetirizine nor albuterol uniformly inhibited exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Serum concentrations of cetirizine were consistent with systemic H1-blocking activity. Modest bronchodilation occurred after administration of cetirizine and albuterol before exercise but not after the third dose of cetirizine in the allergen protocol. One subject developed moderate drowsiness during multiple dosing with cetirizine. Thus, cetirizine, in the doses studied, is not uniformly effective in preventing allergen- or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Histamine is one of many mediators participating in immediate asthmatic responses, and selective H1 antagonists do not completely block these airway events. However, cetirizine may still clinically benefit some patients with asthma, such as patients with allergic rhinitis or urticaria.\r"

  ".W": "Public knowledge and beliefs about urinary incontinence in adulthood are potentially significant contributors to the success or lack of success of intervention strategies. This is especially true given the repeated finding that significant proportions of incontinent people (at least half) do not report their incontinence to a physician. Although there is little literature on this topic, at least three salient features need to be recognized. First, there is an indication that laypeople have vague understandings of the causes and parameters of incontinence. The functioning of the human body is a mystery to many adult Americans. This lack of information is fostered by cultural beliefs that the body is something off-limits, that its functions are the appropriate domain of specialists. Of course, educational factors and possibly ethnic affiliations modify this lack of information. Lack of information is compounded by lack of an appropriate vocabulary. Clinicians must be aware that a patient's understanding of the body or terminology for bodily functions may not fit their own framework. Second, there is consistent evidence that elderly people often consider urinary incontinence to be an inevitable and irremediable part of the normal aging process. This linkage of incontinence and normal aging is probably protective of self-esteem but does little to foster amelioration of incontinence. The belief that incontinence signals oncoming incompetence is a cultural construction that is apparent in popular culture, such as literature and movies and reflected in the secrecy attendant on much incontinence in later life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been widely accepted that the limited life span of human diploid fibroblasts in culture provides a valid experimental model for the study of aging at the cellular level. In spite of innumerable investigations the underlying cause of cessation of growth is not known. Many approaches are being used to test the specific hypothesis that cells at the end of their life span produce an inhibitor of the initiation of DNA synthesis which irreversibly arrests cells in G1, rather than resulting in cell death. This implies that there is positive control of cell proliferation and that the final population of noncycling cells is in a stable state. There appears to be a basic contradiction between this interpretation of published data and the long-standing view that cells actually become progressively senescent during phase III of their growth in vitro. The DNA inhibitor theory can be criticized on a number of grounds, and there is considerable evidence that fibroblasts at the end of their life span are heterogeneous and have a very complex pleiotropic phenotype. One effect of these changes would be to prevent DNA synthesis and normal progression through the cell cycle. The conclusion is that phase III cells are indeed senescent, presumably as a result of a general failure to maintain the integrity of macromolecules and other cellular components.\r"

With advancing age there are significant increases in heart weight, ventricular septal and probably left ventricular free wall thickness, and in valve circumferences. In the myocardium, there are increases in fat, collagen, elastin, and lipofuscin. The geometry of the heart changes as well, due to decreasing base-to-apex dimension, rightward shift and dilatation of the aortic root, and left atrial dilatation. The aortic and mitral valves thicken and become fibrotic along their appositional surfaces, and their annuli are the sites of collagen degeneration, lipid accumulation, and calcification. The coronary arteries become tortuous, dilated, and focally calcified. There are atrophy and loss of specialized conduction tissue in the atria and ventricles. These changes, while usually modest, might diminish the ability of the aged heart to adapt to the stresses imposed by a number of cardiovascular diseases.\r"

Age, presurgical Snellen letter acuity, location of retinal lesions, and presurgical visual function in everyday life (newspaper reading or television viewing) were all reliable correlates of surgical outcome. These data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression to develop a clinical index combining presurgical Snellen letter acuity, location of retinal lesions, and age to predict surgical success. The resulting index demonstrated 83% sensitivity and 85% specificity in sample data, correctly predicting 83% of patients (predictive value positive: 73%; predictive value negative: 90%).\r"

However, in vivo delivery of neutrophils into skin abrasions was significantly reduced: 8.4 X 10(5), versus 2.7 X 10(6) in the young. In addition, their neutrophils showed a smaller increase in the surface adhesion glycoprotein CD11 and in adherence to endothelium in response to stimulation with FMLP than did cells from young controls. Inversely, baseline CD11 expression was higher in elderly subjects, suggesting that their cells may have an in vivo defect in mediator responsiveness. Serum immunoglobulin and complement concentrations were also compared. The mean IgM level of 106.3 mg/dl in the elderly was significantly below the 154.4 mg/dl in the young. In contrast, concentrations of C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement were significantly higher in the elderly.\r"

Results indicate that total time to reach a decision did not differ according to age. However, retirement-age participants used less information, spent more time viewing, and re-viewed fewer bits of information than college-age participants. Information search patterns differed markedly between age groups. Patterns of retirement-age adults indicated their use of noncompensatory decision rules which, according to decision-making literature (Payne, 1976), reduce cognitive processing demands. The patterns of the college-age adults indicated their use of compensatory decision rules, which have higher processing demands.\r"

Specifically, we have transfected I-A alpha d and I-A beta d cDNA into a panel of T cell thymomas of various phenotypes. Excellent class II surface expression was achieved in all T cell tumors, equivalent in level to that found on the B cell lymphoma A20. Interestingly, however, two allo-I-Ad-specific Thy differed in their recognition of the transfected tumor cells: whereas the 42H11 T cell hybridoma (THy) was stimulated very efficiently by all transfectants, the RK38.2.2 Thy did not react to any of them. Both THy responded equally well to I-Ad on A20 B lymphoma cells. Purified macrophages isolated from various sources were also differentially recognized by the two THy, although there was only a quantitative difference in stimulation. Taken together, these results are best interpreted to show that the TCR of the RK38.2.2 THy is specific for I-Ad in the context of a B cell-specific determinant, possibly a self-peptide that is naturally associated with Ia. A cross-reactive molecule could be expressed by macrophages and COS-1 cells, but not by T cells.\r"

  ".W": "This study describes the derivation of a series of mutants from the human leukemic cell line CEM using the frame shift mutagen Ethyl-methanesulfonate followed by negative selection with multiple treatments of OKT4A + C, and sorting into CD4-, CD4-dull, and CD4-intermediate mutants. These mutants express reduced CD4 levels ranging from 0 to 60% of the parental line. The mutants were analyzed by staining with a battery of CD4-specific mAb, by assessing their ability to bind soluble gp120, and by their ability to form syncytia after infection with cell-free HIV I virus and a gp160-vaccinia vector. Two groups of particularly interesting mutants were identified: (1) CD4-dull mutants expressing only 5 to 10% of the wild type surface CD4 density, which nevertheless were infectable by HIV I and produced as many syncytia and reverse transcriptase activity as the parental line after infection with gp160-vaccinia or cell free HIV I. (2) CD4-intermediate mutants (30 to 60% of parental CD4 level), which express CD4-epitopes required for interaction with the HIV I envelope protein, yet are markedly deficient in their ability to form syncytia after gp160-vaccinia or HIV I infection. Two of these mutants did form syncytia after transient reconstitution with a wild type CD4 containing vaccinia vector. Inasmuch as they were found to bind soluble gp120 with the same avidity as other, functionally normal, CD4-intermediate mutants, these human T cell mutants may have a reduced susceptibility to HIV I infection due to the absence of a \"fusogenic component\" or to a structural alteration in a region of the CD4 molecule not required for binding of the HIV I envelope, but for the subsequent fusion and entry process.\r"

HIV-1-infected MM presented tetanus toxin (TT) and streptokinase to T cells (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) comparable to presentation by uninfected MM. In these studies, it was observed that HIV-1-infected MM without additional exogenous Ag stimulated autologous T lymphocytes, however, to a lesser degree than with TT and streptokinase. Virus production in T cells appeared to be relative to the degree of stimulation with the highest levels of stimulation and infection observed when T cells were exposed to HIV-1-infected TT-presenting MM. Studies were carried out to examine some of the restricting elements in MM-mediated infection of T lymphocytes with and without TT presentation. Antibodies to CD4, as well as soluble immunopurified gp120, blocked cell-mediated infection indicating that infection of T cells was through the CD4 molecule as has been demonstrated with cell-free virus. In addition, soluble gp120 inhibited Ag presentation by HIV-1-infected and uninfected MM. mAb to MHC class II Ag HLA-DR and -DP blocked T cell infection by HIV-1-infected MM with and without presentation of TT. No effect was observed with mAb to MHC class I Ag. These results indicate that virus transmission to T lymphocytes can be mediated by HIV-1-infected MM and that these cells maintain their function as APC. Activation of T cells appears to be important in the process of T cell infection in this system inasmuch as antibodies that block Ag presentation and thus a T cell proliferative signal inhibit infection.\r"

Keratinocytes have been demonstrated to produce a number of immunoactive cytokines, including factors capable of modifying macrophage function. We have previously identified at least two products of keratinocytes that induce DNA synthesis by elicited peritoneal macrophages; one factor has been identified as granulocyte-macrophage CSF. In the present study, the second keratinocyte product has been characterized and identified as macrophage-CSF (M-CSF). Conditioned media from cultures of normal human keratinocytes and the transformed murine keratinocyte cell line PAM 212 induce formation of macrophage colonies in soft agar as well as dose-dependent proliferation of the M-CSF-dependent cell line BAC1.2F5. The bioactivity in both assays is blocked by neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from both PAM 212 and normal human keratinocytes demonstrates multiple molecular mass forms of M-CSF (45 to 98 kDa). Northern blot analysis (PAM 212 cells) and in situ hybridization (normal keratinocytes) demonstrate expression of M-CSF mRNA. Stimulation of keratinocytes with LPS increases M-CSF synthesis as measured both by bioactivity and level of mRNA expression. Thus, both murine and human keratinocytes produce M-CSF in vitro. Furthermore, production of keratinocyte-derived M-CSF is increased by bacterial LPS. CSF production by keratinocytes may play an important role in regulating the cutaneous immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF)/IL-8, a novel cytokine, distinct from IL-1 and TNF was recently purified and cloned. This study was performed to investigate the biologic effect of recombinant MDNCF/IL-8 on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) by assessment of their growth inhibitory activity against Candida albicans. The chemoattractant, FMLP was used as a positive control. We demonstrated that MDNCF/IL-8, similar to FMLP, effectively enhanced PMN-mediated anti-Candida activity. MDNCF/IL-8, from 1.0 to 1000 ng/mol, enhanced PMN-mediated anti-Candida activity, whereas FMLP was effective from 10(-10) to 10(-7) M. The optimal dose of MDNCF/IL-8 for PMN stimulation was 10 ng/ml which equalled the optimal chemoattractant dose. MDNCF/IL-8 itself, like FMLP, had no direct effect on Candida growth at any concentration and it stimulated antifungal activity only in PMN but not in monocytes. Interestingly, MDNCF/IL-8 failed to stimulate directly the production of superoxide from PMN or prime the respiratory burst of PMN exposed to FMLP. However, MDNCF/IL-8 was capable of releasing azurophilic enzymes from cytochalasin B-treated PMN into the extracellular space. Enhancement of PMN anti-Candida activity and release of azurophilic enzymes from PMN by MDNCF/IL-8 were inhibited in the presence of colchicine, which is a known inhibitor of degranulation. These results suggest that MDNCF/IL-8 induced antifungal action of PMN via oxygen-independent pathways. Furthermore, MDNCF/IL-8 induction of anti-Candida action by PMN was inhibited by pretreatment with Bordetella pertussis toxin, suggesting that enhancement of PMN antifungal activity by MDNCF/IL-8, as well as by FMLP, may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein.\r"

These three fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating proteins (FINAP) could be purified by subsequently performed reversed phase and size exclusion HPLC. By high resolution SDS-PAGE, all the proteins were shown to migrate with an Mr of 6,700 (alpha-FINAP), 3,600 (beta-FINAP), and 5,300 (gamma-FINAP). All purified cytokine preparations were found to be chemotactic for human neutrophils. In addition, all FINAP induced release of lysosomal enzymes in neutrophils. Deactivation of chemotaxin-elicitable enzyme release showed cross-desensitization of all FINAP with NAP-1/IL-8. Western blot analysis of alpha-FINAP by using mAb against neutrophil-activating protein (NAP)-1/IL-8 reveals immunologic cross-reactivity with NAP-1/IL-8. By amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis alpha-FINAP could be identified as the 77-residue extended form of NAP-1/IL-8 containing the 79-residue form as a minor contaminant. Whereas beta-FINAP has been found to be a truncation product of alpha-FINAP, gamma-FINAP shows identity with authentic melanoma growth stimulatory activity with respect to retention time upon reversed phase HPLC, high resolution SDS-PAGE, and biologic properties, as well as amino-terminal amino acid sequence. These data show that human dermal fibroblasts may actively participate in inflammatory reactions by secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.\r"

Our ability to detect G-CSF and GM-CSF activity in the conditioned medium of the human astroglial tumor cell line, U87MG, and molecularly clone the cDNA for G-CSF from a U87MG cDNA library raised the possibility that astroglial cells are capable of G-CSF and GM-CSF production within the central nervous system; if so, the production of these CSF by astroglial cells may be inducible by IL-1. We examined the effects of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta on the production of G-CSF and GM-CSF by U87MG and U373MG, another astroglial tumor cell line that does not constitutively produce CSF. We demonstrate that both U87MG and U373MG can be induced to produce G-CSF and GM-CSF by exposure to IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. This response, measured by accumulation of increased CSF mRNA, is rapid, sensitive and due to the enhanced stability of CSF message following IL-1 exposure. The implications of these findings to the immunopathogenesis of central nervous system infections are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90187875\r", 
  ".W": "The catalytic activity of human tryptase, a mast cell neutral endoprotease, is expressed when the enzyme is in its tetrameric form, but is lost under physiologic conditions concomitant with a quaternary structural alteration involving conversion to a monomeric form. The associated changes in the CD spectra noted in the current study indicate accompanying alterations in the secondary structure of the protein. In particular, the progressive disappearance of the negative minimum centered at 228 nm suggests an effect on beta-sheet structure, which may be important for monomer-monomer interaction and/or stabilization of catalytic activity. Dextran sulfate, like heparin, stabilizes the catalytic activity and quaternary structure of tryptase and also maintains the native secondary structure of the enzyme at and beyond a temperature of 40 degrees C. Dextran sulfate-stabilized tryptase therefore was used as an immunogen to which were produced three murine mAb (B2, C11, and G4) recognizing the catalytically active form of the enzyme. Inactive tryptase bound to plastic microtiter wells was not recognized by any of the newly made antibodies, whereas inactive tryptase in solution was recognized by G4, which when biotinylated, could be used as a detector antibody in a sandwich ELISA for tryptase. Each of the newly made mAb recognized the catalytically active form of tryptase. Thus, alterations in epitopes, perhaps reflecting tertiary structural alterations as well as changes in secondary and quaternary conformations, occur with tryptase inactivation. A pragmatic result of these newly generated antibodies is the affinity purification to homogeneity of active tryptase by sequential chromatography with B2 coupled to CH-Sepharose and heparin-agarose. Tryptase purified by this technique had a specific activity with p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester of 117 +/- 9 U/mg and had 3.9 +/- 0.3 active sites per molecule of active enzyme (134,000 m.w.) as titrated with p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate. The spectral and immunologic data in the current study are consistent with concerted conformational alterations in the secondary and tertiary as well as quaternary structures of tryptase associated with loss of catalytic activity. Failure to reverse any of these alterations with dextran sulfate suggests that the pathway of tetramer assembly in vivo is more complicated than simple subunit association.\r"

The adhesion complex was blocked by administering the anti-CD18 mAb 60.3. The data show that mAb 60.3 blocks PMN emigration into inflammatory foci in the abdominal wall produced by implanting sponges containing either hydrochloric acid, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli endotoxin, or PMA. mAb 60.3 also inhibited PMN emigration in response to peritoneal instillation of S. pneumoniae. The effect of mAb 60.3 on PMN emigration in the lungs varied depending upon the stimulus. PMN failed to migrate into the PMA-induced pneumonia; however, mAb 60.3 pretreatment only partially inhibited endotoxin-induced pneumonia and did not inhibit S. pneumoniae or hydrochloric acid-induced pneumonias. PMN lavaged from the alveolar spaces in the Streptococcal pneumonia had similar quantities of mAb 60.3 bound to their surfaces as the circulating PMN. We conclude that the CD11/CD18 complex mediates PMN adherence in the systemic circulation. However, PMN adherence in the pulmonary circulation may occur by either CD18-dependent or -independent mechanisms that are specific to the inciting stimulus.\r"

We investigated triggering of the respiratory burst of activated macrophages induced by phagocytosis of virulent T. cruzi, bloodform trypomastigotes, amastigotes obtained from spleens, and tissue culture organisms; and of relatively nonvirulent epimastigotes. All stages of T. cruzi prompted the release of less than 10% of hydrogen peroxide released by activated macrophages when stimulated with PMA or Candida. Superoxide anion production was not stimulated by PMA or Candida in activated macrophages nor was there a significant qualitative reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium induced by ingestion of virulent T. cruzi. Opsonization of T. cruzi with specific antibody did not promote the release of hydrogen peroxide or the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Similar results were observed with activated spleen macrophages. Incubation of activated macrophages with catalase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, sodium benzoate with or without catalase, and respiratory burst-exhausting PMA failed to inhibit the killing of T. cruzi in vitro. These results indicate that 1) virulent opsonized or unopsonized T. cruzi do not trigger a respiratory burst by activated macrophages and 2) oxygen-independent killing of T. cruzi is of prime importance.\r"

In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the proliferative activity of TAM, expression of c-fms and macrophage (M)-CSF was investigated in TAM and sarcoma cells. TAM had high levels of mRNA transcripts of the c-fms protooncogene, which encodes a tyrosine kinase probably identical to the M-CSF receptor, but did not express M-CSF transcripts whereas sarcoma cells had high levels of M-CSF mRNA. Sarcoma cell conditioned medium had M-CSF activity on bone marrow cells and induced proliferation of peritoneal exudate and bone marrow-derived macrophages. These activities were blocked by anti-M-CSF antibodies. These findings outline a paracrine circuit in the regulation of TAM proliferation, involving M-CSF, secreted by sarcoma cells and acting on c-fms expressing TAM. Inasmuch as TAM from these murine sarcomas have tumor growth promoting activity, a \"ping pong\" reciprocal feeding interaction may occur between macrophages and neoplastic cells in these tumors.\r"

We have previously shown that specialized endothelial cells are present in the dermis of psoriatic skin and are capable of supporting lymphocyte adherence and promoting lymphocyte extravasation. In this study, we investigated the dermal endothelial binding properties of human lymphocyte subsets and the role of LFA-1 molecules in the adhesion process. It was found that both human T cells and B cells adhered to frozen sections of psoriatic plaques, but with different cell dose-response relationships. In addition, quantitative assessment of lymphocyte adhesion demonstrated that human CD4+T cells and the CDw29+ (helper-inducer) subset adhered preferentially to the papillary dermis as compared with CD8+ T cells or the CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) subset. Moreover, human lymphocytes adhered to untreated psoriatic plaques, but not to uninvolved skin or to steroid-treated, clinically and histologically resolved lesions. Preincubation of T lymphocytes with saturating amounts of monoclonal antibody 60.3 against the surface membrane CD18 glycoprotein complex inhibited partially their capacity to bind to untreated psoriatic plaques. These observations suggest that the emigration of human CD4+ T cell and the CDw29+ helper-inducer subset is promoted by selective adherence to psoriatic dermal endothelia, with LFA-1 molecules playing an accessory role in the binding process.\r"

After amplification of genomic DNA by using the polymerase chain reaction, the occurrence of point mutations was investigated with 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides. These probes are complementary to the known point-mutated nucleotide sequences of the ras genes. In four out of the 30 BCC studied, point mutations were detected at codon 12 of the K-ras gene and at codon 61 of the H-ras gene. The K-ras mutations involve glycine to cysteine and glycine to asparagine amino acid changes. The mutation at codon 61 of the H-ras gene is consistent with a replacement of glutamine by histidine. In one SCC, a point mutation was detected at codon 12 of the K-ras gene, involving a glycine to cysteine substitution in the gene product. These findings demonstrate that mutational activation of ras genes takes place in skin carcinomas, but the rate at which these mutations occur seems to be relatively low.\r"

To investigate the basis for its therapeutic efficacy, the tissue and cellular content of cyclophilin, a cytosolic receptor for cyclosporine A, has been determined in keratome biopsies from normal and psoriatic epidermis and in cultured, adult human keratinocytes. The mean cyclophilin content of normal (n = 10), involved (n = 10), and uninvolved (n = 10) psoriatic epidermal samples was not significantly different (0.126 +/- 0.016, 0.106 +/- 0.009, and 0.153 +/- 0.018 microgram cyclosporine A bound/mg cytosolic protein). Similarly, the cyclophilin content of keratinocytes cultured from normal and psoriatic epidermis (0.21 +/- 0.016 and 0.18 +/- 0.024 microgram/mg protein, respectively) did not differ significantly. Western blot analysis of normal and psoriatic epidermal extracts with monospecific rabbit anti-cyclophilin antisera revealed a single band of 17,000 daltons, which co-migrated with highly purified bovine cyclophilin. The intensity of this band was similar in normal and psoriatic samples, indicating that immunoreactive cyclophilin content was similar. Cyclophilin mRNA was readily detected in normal and involved psoriatic epidermis by RNA blot hybridization, and expression was not significantly different in normal and psoriatic epidermis. These findings indicate that cyclophilin is present in human keratinocytes and epidermis, where it may account for the accumulation of cyclosporine during therapy. However, the similar cyclophilin content of normal and diseased tissue suggests that differences in cyclosporine uptake probably do not account for its therapeutic efficacy in psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study we showed that the use of a newly developed, highly water vapor permeable, PEU wound dressing accelerates the epithelization of partial-thickness wounds more than an occlusive wound dressing (OpSite) in comparison with air exposure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of fibrin(ogen), fibronectin, and type IV collagen during the epithelization process under these three conditions. The breathable PEU film enabled coagulation of the wound exudate, preserving it into a semisolid gelatinous state. This coagulum layer contained an abundant amount of fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin. In wounds occluded with OpSite film, depositions of fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin were less extensive. Migrating keratinocytes contained intracellular depositions of fibrin(ogen), suggesting that these cells phagocytize components of the provisional fibrin matrix during wound healing. It was concluded that accelerated epithelization underneath the highly water vapor permeable polyetherurethane film dressing is associated with the presence of a gelatinous coagulum containing fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin. We speculate that the enhanced healing rate might be caused by an increased concentration of growth-promoting factors present in the residual exudate underneath the PEU dressing.\r"

These changes are statistically correlated with the CDC staging system, the number of CD4+ cells, the amount of p24 antigen in serum, and the anti-p24 antibody titers, indicating the potential value of soluble CD16 titer as an easily available serum marker of disease progression. To evaluate a possible link between this observation and the expression of membrane-associated CD16/FcRIII, flow cytometry immunofluorescence analysis was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients in three CDC stages; no specific changes in the number of natural killer cells expressing CD16+ antigens or in the total number of Leu19+ cells were found. However, there was a statistical correlation between the absolute number of T cells expressing CD16 antigens (CD3+/CD16+) and the modulated titers of soluble CD16 in HIV-infected serum.\r"

Infections caused by the epidemic strain developed more frequently in valve surgery patients than in those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (P = .03) and occurred only in patients operated on by surgeon A. None of 17 members of the cardiac surgery team carried the epidemic strain in their anterior nares, axillae, or inguinal folds. Hand cultures were performed on 8 surgical personnel, and only surgeon A carried the epidemic strain on his hands. Isolates from cardiac surgery patients, bypass pump blood cultures, and the hands of the implicated surgeon all had identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, plasmid profiles, and EcoRI restriction endonuclease digest patterns. In the 24 months after control measures were implemented, no infections caused by the epidemic strain occurred among open heart surgery patients. The findings suggest that the common-source outbreak of infections among cardiac surgery patients was due to carriage of a strain S. epidermidis on the hands of a cardiac surgeon.\r"

The presence and organization of pap homologous DNA was determined using two probes specific for pap in 217 uropathogenic E. coli samples by dot blot and Southern blot analysis. The frequency of pap homologous DNA was 76% in pyelonephritis, 69% in cystitis, and 52% in an asymptomatic bacteriuria group. Further, the gal alpha 1-4gal beta binding phenotype among the pap-positive strains was expressed more often in acute pyelonephritis (91%) than the cystitis (60%) or asymptomatic bacteriuria (52%) strains. This was explained in part by difference in organization of pap homologous DNA between the genotypically positive pyelonephritis and asymptomatic bacteriuria strains. The pyelonephritis isolates contained three copies of pap significantly more often than the asymptomatic bacteriuria strains, and the pyelonephritogenic O-antigen types had a general increase in pap copy number. The difference in expression of gal alpha 1-4gal beta adhesins between pyelonephritis and asymptomatic bacteriuria isolates was thus not only a function of the frequency of pap homologous DNA but also of phenotypic expression among genotypically pap-positive strains.\r"

Adherence factors, urease, and hemolysin may be virulence determinants. These factors were compared for bacteria cultured from 16 patients with acute pyelonephritis and 35 with catheter-associated bacteriuria and for 20 fecal isolates. Pyelonephritis isolates were more likely (P less than .05) to express the mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) hemagglutinin in the absence of mannose-resistant/Klebsiella-like (MR/K) hemagglutinin than were catheter-associated or fecal isolates. Pyelonephritis isolates produced urease activity of 63 +/- 27 (mean +/- SD) mumol of NH3/min/mg of protein, not significantly different from catheter-associated or fecal isolates. Hybridization of Southern blots of P. mirabilis chromosomal DNA with two urease gene probes demonstrated that urease gene sequences were conserved in all isolates. Geometric mean of reciprocal hemolytic titers for pyelonephritis isolates was 27.9; for urinary catheter isolates, 18.0; and for fecal isolates, 55.7 (not significantly different, P greater than .1). Although in vivo expression of urease and hemolysin may not be reliable indexes of virulence, MR/P hemagglutination in the absence of MR/K hemagglutination may be necessary for development of pyelonephritis.\r"

Total IgG and IgG4 antibody responses to Onchocerca volvulus were examined by enzyme immunoassay and by immunoblot. Significant background IgG reactivity was detected in both assays in US control sera and sera from patients with intestinal nematode infections, but background reactivity was negligible in the IgG4 assays. IgG4 antibodies were detected by enzyme immunoassay in 17 of 18 Nigerian onchocerciasis serum samples and in 2 of 9 endemic control serum samples. Cross-reactive IgG4 antibodies were present in serum pools from patients infected with other filariae. IgG4 antibodies recognized a restricted subset of O. volvulus antigens in immunoblots relative to IgG. These results confirm the previously reported enhanced specificity of IgG4 antibody assays for filariasis and extend the observation to include onchocerciasis. Whereas IgG4 subclass antibody serology is more specific than measurement of total IgG antibodies for onchocerciasis, cross-reactivity among filariae limits the utility of this approach.\r"

Clearance half-times were directly correlated with both the absolute parasite count (r = .635, P less than .005) and hematocrit (r = .791, P less than .001). Clearance half-times in patients varied from 1.0 to 96.3 h (median, 14.8 h) while those of controls ranged from 8.0 to 80.3 h (median, 23.1 h) (P = .10). Nine of the 20 patients had clearance half-times shorter than the lower 95% confidence limit of controls (less than 12.4 h). The clearance of IgG-coated erythrocytes was accelerated after parasites were eliminated from the circulation (P less than .05) and returned toward normal 6-8 weeks after the acute infection. Although circulating immune complexes were detectable, there was no correlation between immune complex levels and clearance half-times (P greater than .05). The failure to increase Fc receptor-mediated red cell clearance in patients with high parasitemias suggests inadequate splenic phagocytic activity in the face of considerable antigenic challenge. These findings indicate that splenic Fc receptor function may be important both in the control of infection and the development of anemia in P. falciparum malaria.\r"

Early and late serum samples were available for 45 men with LAS (median interval 49 months). Men with early LAS did not differ from HIV-seronegative men in either the percentage that were HHV-6-seropositive or in the distribution of titers. There was a significantly lower percentage of seropositives in AIDS patients than in the other two groups (P less than .01). LAS patients who progressed to AIDS did not differ in percentage seropositivity or distribution of titers from nonprogressors. HHV-6 titers tended to decrease over time. HHV-6 titers late in LAS were similar to those in AIDS patients.

The binding of IgG subclasses to HuK was detected by the use of indirect immunofluorescence done with monoclonal antibodies that were specific for each of the four human IgG subclasses. IgG1 and IgG4 binding to keratinocytes was detected in all of the pemphigus IgG preparations. In each instance, the titer of bound IgG1 was equal to or greater than the IgG4 titer. IgG3 binding was detected in only one PV IgG, and IgG2 pemphigus antibody activity was not detected. Differences in the immunofluorescence patterns between the five PV and one PF IgG and between the five PV and a second PF serum were noted. PV antigens were detected as a speckled pattern on HuKs, with accentuation in the intercellular spaces. By comparison, the pattern of PF antigen expression varied significantly depending on whether anti-IgG1 or anti-IgG4 antisera were used. Anti-IgG1 bound in a coarse granular pattern without accentuation in the intercellular spaces, but anti-IgG4 bound in a pattern nearly identical to that observed with PV IgG and its subclasses.\r"

It seems likely that they originated there as pre-Christian healing traditions which were subsequently incorporated into those associated with the Church. The centre of these traditions was (and is) St Cado in the South of Brittany, near Carnac.\r"

The low HDL levels were related to parasitaemia, and rapidly recovered after successful therapy. Plasma triglyceride concentrations were moderately increased and plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations decreased during the course of infection. The mechanisms underlying the selective and pronounced decline in HDL cholesterol concentration remain obscure, but the reproducible phenomenon may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool in suspected malaria infection.\r"

The infant was stolen and subsequently presented to physicians by a woman posing as the mother. Methods used to help confirm the surviving infant's parentage involved red cell antigen and enzyme system evaluations as well as immunoglobulin allotyping, which ultimately proved to be the most effective serologic test performed. The forensic science investigation of this unusual case also used bite mark analysis and patterned injury interpretation. Immunoglobulin allotyping is specifically discussed as a forensic serology test which is currently available and particularly applicable in cases involving parentage determination.\r"

  ".W": "A major weakness of medical decision analysis has been the inability of the commonly used single attribute utility models to adequately represent clinical decision making situations. To illustrate this problem, I reanalyzed a well known decision analysis that is widely interpreted as proof that two decision alternatives are equivalent in all clinically meaningful respects. The reanalysis was based on a more representative decision model made possible by the use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multiobjective decision making technique. The use of this model resulted in the identification of a clearly preferred alternative, indicating that the results of the original analysis have been widely misinterpreted. The degree to which a decision model represents clinical reality influences the correct interpretation of a decision analysis. Limited decision models can yield only limited conclusions. The use of more representative multiobjective decision models would improve the clinical usefulness of medical decision analyses.\r"

  ".U": "90188456\r", 
  ".W": "Between May 1986 and August 1989, we treated 18 patients with 21 recurrent or persistent brain metastases with stereotactic radiosurgery using a modified linear accelerator. To be eligible for radiosurgery, patients had to have a performance status of greater than or equal to 70% and have no evidence of (or stable) systemic disease. All but one patient had received prior radiotherapy, and were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery at the time of recurrence. Polar lesions were treated only if the patient had undergone and failed previous complete surgical resection (10 patients). Single doses of radiation (900 to 2,500 cGy) were delivered to limited volumes (less than 27 cm3) using a modified 6MV linear accelerator. The most common histology of the metastatic lesion was carcinoma of the lung (seven patients), followed by carcinoma of the breast (four patients), and melanoma (four patients). With median follow-up of 9 months (range, 1 to 39), all tumors have been controlled in the radiosurgery field. Two patients failed in the immediate margin of the treated volume and were subsequently treated with surgery and implantation of 125I to control the disease. Radiographic response was dramatic and rapid in the patients with adenocarcinoma, while slight reduction and stabilization occurred in those patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and sarcoma. The majority of patients improved neurologically following treatment, and were able to be withdrawn from corticosteroid therapy. Complications were limited and transient in nature and no cases of symptomatic radiation necrosis occurred in any patient despite previous exposure to radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective and relatively safe treatment for recurrent solitary metastases and is an appealing technique for the initial management of deep-seated lesions as a boost to whole brain radiotherapy.\r"

In 1986 the study was modified to allow patients on CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen to be rerandomized after completing 5 years of tamoxifen to either continue for life or to stop therapy. Patients were stratified for number of involved nodes and estrogen-receptor (ER) status and randomized to receive one of three treatments: CMFPT X 4, CMFPT X 12, or CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen. Of 962 patients entered on the study, 803 were eligible. Life-threatening toxicity occurred in 75 and lethal toxicity in seven patients. Median follow-up is 4.1 years; 279 patients had recurrent disease. Time to relapse (TTR) is significantly longer for patients on CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen than for CMFPT X 4 (P = .002), or CMFPT X 12 (P = 0.05). Differences between four or 12 cycles of CMFPT are not significant; relapse-free rates at 5 years are 61% for CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen, 51% on CMFPT X 12, and 52% on CMFPT X 4. Treatment differences in overall survival are not significant. Hormone receptor status and number of involved nodes were found to be significant prognostic parameters.\r"

After complete remission (CR), obtained with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients were randomized to receive bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or no further therapy. BCG was administered in weekly scarifications up to 3 years. Forty-three patients are assessable. Twenty-four patients have relapsed: nine out of 21 in the BCG group, and 15 out of 22 in the control group. There is a significant difference in favor of the BCG group in disease-free survival (P = .03). Twenty-one patients have died, 18 from NHML: seven in the BCG group, and 11 in the control group. There is a significant difference in favor of the BCG group for overall survival at 10 years (P = .05). A multivariate analysis points out BCG as a significant prognostic factor. Adjuvant BCG may improve particularly disease-free survival and overall survival for patients with clinical stages I and II or intermediate- and high-grade malignancy. These results suggest that in patients less than 65 years old with NHML of poor prognosis, BCG may significantly increase disease-free survival and overall survival.\r"

After that the children were randomized to repeat the same scheme or intercalate teniposide (VM26) plus cytarabine (AraC) with the induction-phase scheme. All of them were treated for only 6 months. The protocol approved to be very effective with 85% remission in all the children and 94% survival in patients surviving the induction phase. The toxicity was acceptable, also considering the characteristics of our population (malnourished children). The group VM26 and AraC had few hospital admissions in spite of the small number of children because they received VM26 and AraC as outpatients. The sale purpose of the present study is to report that with a few simple procedures such as hydration, alkalinization, and drug fractionation, the chemotherapy schemes used can bring about a dramatic improvement in short-term survival.\r"

According to the Rome Workshop criteria, 77% were at standard and 23% at high initial prognostic risk. In 33% of the cases, ITR occurred during first treatment. The REC80-ITR protocol consisted of an induction phase regimen of vincristine (VCR), cytarabine (ARA-C), methotrexate (MTX), and asparaginase (L-asp), and bilateral testicular irradiation, and CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal MTX and a maintenance phase with a multidrug rotating regimen. Total treatment duration was 30 months. The median time of observation after ITR was 51 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and disease-free survival (DFS) at 4 years were 67.7% and 41%, respectively. Patients who had an ITR on therapy or within the first off-therapy year showed the poorest outcome. The DFS at 3 years was 20%, 47.6%, and 100%, respectively, for children who had an ITR on treatment (n = 16), within the first year of treatment withdrawal (n = 22), or later (n = 10) (P = .001). Patients with an asymptomatic occult testicular infiltrate at treatment discontinuation had a very unfavorable prognosis. Eighty-one percent of second relapses involved the bone marrow. In our experience, children presenting an early ITR (ie, within 6 months of treatment withdrawal) need a very aggressive treatment because of the high probability of an underlying systemic disease. On the other hand, patients with a late ITR seem to have a truly local recurrence and can apparently be cured by standard protocols, as shown in protocol REC80-ITR.\r"

  ".W": "Increased expression of P-glycoprotein is associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) in many cell lines. Significant levels of P-glycoprotein have been detected in a number of human tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether P-glycoprotein expression correlates with both response to chemotherapy and prognosis in soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. In a retrospective study, biopsy samples from 30 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and undifferentiated sarcoma (US) treated at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto were analyzed using a semiquantitative immunohistochemical procedure. P-glycoprotein was detected in nine patients, four at diagnosis, and five at subsequent biopsy. All nine patients relapsed after a clinical response (complete [CR] 55%, partial [PR] 45%) to chemotherapy. Twenty of 21 patients with consistently P-glycoprotein-negative tumors received chemotherapy and they all responded clinically (CR 80%, PR 20%). Only one of these 20 patients has relapsed. The probability of relapse-free survival was significantly different (P less than .000000012) in chemotherapy-treated patients whose tumors contained detectable levels of P-glycoprotein (n = 9), compared with those whose tumors contained no detectable P-glycoprotein (n = 20). The overall probability of survival was also significantly different in these two groups (P less than .0000267). Both relapse-free and overall survivals remained statistically different in the two groups of patients when analyzed by the log-rank method, after adjustment for differences in stages and sites. The incidence of other adverse prognostic factors in the two groups, for example, younger and older ages, low pretreatment lymphocyte counts, large tumors, and unfavorable histology were not significantly different. Thus, detectable P-glycoprotein appears to be an important adverse prognostic factor in children with soft tissue sarcoma, and consistent absence of the protein is associated with a favorable prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and toxicity of the new anthracycline, 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyl doxorubicin (THP) (50 mg/m2 intravenous [IV] bolus) in association with cisplatin (100 mg/m2 IV as a 4-hour infusion) was assessed in 31 patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Twenty-eight patients were assessable for toxicity among whom 25 were assessable for response (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IIIa, four patients; IIIb, 15 patients; IV, six patients). Nine patients had received prior treatment. Patients were randomized to receive schedule (sch) A (THP at 6 hours, then cisplatin from 16 to 20 hours) or sch B (THP at 18 hours, then cisplatin from 4 to 8 hours). Sch A was hypothesized as less toxic since THP was best tolerated in the late rest span and cisplatin near the middle of the activity span in experimental studies. The rate of clinical complete response (CR) was 52%, that of partial response (PR) was 12%, and the overall clinical response rate (CR plus PR) was 64% (sch A, 73%; sch B, 57%). Median progression-free survival and survival times were, respectively, 10 and 19 months. Of 12 patients in clinical CR evaluated at second-look laparotomy, four had a pathological CR (33%), and three had microscopic residual disease (MD). The overall rate of pathological CR was 16%. Sch A was associated with less neutropenia (P = .10), thrombocytopenia (P less than .01), anemia (P less than .01), and renal toxicity (P less than .05) than sch B. Of four patients withdrawn for toxicity, three were on sch B (one death). Mean dose intensities (DIs) of THP and cisplatin, respectively, decreased by 30% and 47% over the five initial courses. Such decrease was significantly more pronounced for sch B than for sch A in previously untreated patients (P from 2-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] less than .01). THP-cisplatin is active against advanced ovarian cancer, and its toxicities can be significantly decreased by dosing THP in the early morning and cisplatin in the late afternoon as compared with THP in the evening and cisplatin the next morning.\r"

For patients with neuroblastoma, current conventional surveillance methods include radiologic testing, bone marrow analysis, physical examination, and measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites. Immunocytologic analysis of blood for the detection of circulating tumor cells is a highly specific and sensitive method, which may prove useful in monitoring patients with neuroblastoma. In our study, circulating tumor cells were detected in seven of 10 patients with known disseminated disease at diagnosis and in six of 13 patients during therapy. In some patients, as few as two tumor cells were identified among 100,000 normal hematopoietic cells. The presence or absence of circulating neuroblasts in the 13 patients evaluated during therapy was significantly correlated with tumor relapse (P = .002). We conclude that immunocytologic analysis of blood is a sensitive method for the detection of circulating neuroblasts. We recommend that this technique be used in conjunction with other conventional methods for improved tumor detection and subsequent monitoring of neuroblastoma patients.\r"

A clear association between thoracic radiotherapy and ischemic heart disease was observed among older clinical studies using radiotherapeutic techniques that are no longer optimal by today's standards. Such a relationship could not be confirmed in modern studies in which treatment factors (such as dose and volume of heart irradiated) were more carefully controlled.\r"

These studies were correlated with clinical and radiological findings and, where possible, histopathologic confirmation. In all studies, SPECT gave better definition and better anatomic localization of disease sites than obtained with planar views. SPECT detected more lesions in the head and neck (planar 16, SPECT 19), chest (planar 39, SPECT 45), and abdomen (planar 22, SPECT 24). In six of 20 patients scanned following chemotherapy, SPECT was useful in demonstrating that tracer accumulation in a normally located and shaped thymus indicated uptake resulting from thymic regeneration rather than tumor recurrence. It is concluded that 67Ga SPECT studies are very useful in the pediatric population, where perhaps because of their small size, interpretation of standard planar views may be difficult.\r"

Since iron was found to be in organic combination in blood, it seemed likely that natural diets would be found to supply it in essentially the same form. It was not unexpected, therefore, that from 1850 on into the next century large dietary supplements of iron salts were reported to be almost (or entirely) indigestible. Yet iron salts were undoubtedly effective in treating simple anemia. To escape from the paradox, it was argued that iron salts combined with hydrogen sulfide in the gut, thus sparing the natural organic iron of the diet and allowing it to be better absorbed. Despite experiments refuting this hypothesis, the belief that inorganic iron could not be used in hemoglobin synthesis lingered into the 1920s.\r"

As part of the diagnostic workup, HMO patients were more likely to have had fecal occult blood tests (74% vs 52%, p less than 0.01) and endoscopy or barium enemas (97% vs 90%, p less than 0.05). FFS patients were more likely to have had preoperative imaging studies (54% vs 38%, p less than 0.01). Although there were longer diagnostic delays for HMO enrollees with gastrointestinal bleeding, there were no significant differences in disease stage or clinical status, and postoperative follow-up was similar. The authors conclude that enrollees in Medicare HMOs with colorectal cancer receive medical and surgical care at least equal to that received in FFS settings.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To perform a decision analysis to determine the thresholds of safety and effectiveness that would justify short-term zidovudine (AZT) administration for persons with accidental percutaneous exposure to HIV-positive blood. DESIGN: Published data were used to estimate the seroconversion rate (0.42%), rate of developing AIDS if HIV-infected (5%/year), and survival with AIDS (50%/year). No information is available on zidovudine effectiveness and little is known about fatal toxicity of zidovudine. Death from AIDS or from zidovudine toxicity was used as the endpoint. RESULTS: For those with exposure to blood known to be HIV-seropositive, the benefits of zidovudine outweight the risks if efficacy is above approximately 3% to 8%. Wide variations in the assumptions have little effect on the thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Since clinical trials to determine zidovudine effectiveness in this setting will probably never be done, decision analysis offers the only quantitative method for addressing this question. Unless future studies show zidovudine to be both ineffective and toxic, the benefits of short-term administration of zidovudine outweigh the risks immediately after exposure to HIV-positive blood. Zidovudine benefits do not clearly outweigh the risks after exposure to blood of unknown serologic status, or if there is a delay in starting therapy.\r"

The authors used Bayesian analysis to: 1) estimate the relative prevalences of diseases causing bilateral bilar adenopathy; 2) assess changes in the prevalence of disease by race, the presence of other clinical symptoms, and geography; and 3) determine the value of relevant noninvasive tests, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) assay, gallium scan, and purified protein derivative (PPD), in order to assess when a strategy of watchful waiting is appropriate. The analysis indicated that the ACE assay, particularly when paired with the PPD, can identify many patients who might safely be managed without immediate invasive biopsy. Patients who are ACE+ and PPD- have an estimated probability of sarcoidosis of 0.95 or greater; patients who are ACE- and PPD+ have a probability of tuberculosis of 0.86 if black, 0.79 if white. In contrast, gallium scanning has no diagnostic role in this clinical situation. Bronchoscopic or mediastinoscopic biopsy has a limited role for patients who are ACE+ PPD- or ACE- PPD+ because of limited sensitivity. Patients who are both ACE- and PPD-, particularly if white, may have a high enough risk of lymphoma to consider invasive biopsy.\r"

In contrast, experimental infection of macaques with isolates of SIV/SMM induces chronic and progressive disease that terminates in an AIDS-like illness and death in most animals. To determine whether antibodies might be important in preventing the development of disease in mangabeys or progression of disease in macaques, humoral immune responses to SIV/SMM were compared in 13 macaques infected for up to 43 months and in infected and uninfected mangabeys selected at random from among a breeding colony. Total SIV/SMM-specific antibody titers, profiles of antibodies to specific viral proteins, neutralizing antibodies that inhibited infectivity of cell-free virus or syncytia formation, antibodies that inhibited reverse transcriptase activity, and antibodies to lymphocyte cell-surface antigens were assessed. The results indicated that in macaques the magnitude of the SIV/SMM-specific antibody response and progression of disease were functions of virus load. Surprisingly, asymptomatic mangabeys also had high virus loads with, on average, lower antibody titers than macaques. In both species, the presence of neutralizing antibodies or antibodies that inhibited SIV/SMM reverse transcriptase activity did not correlate with protection from clinical disease. A correlation was observed, however, between the development of disease and the presence of antibodies to an 18-kDa protein that is found on the surface of activated lymphocytes and appears to be related to histone H2B. A similar correlation has been observed in association with HIV infection in humans, suggesting that some manifestations of both human and simian AIDS may result from autoimmune reactions.\r"

In HIV-infected patients, antibodies to recombinant nef protein were seen by Western blot assay in 29 of 54 (54%) individuals at any time during a prospective follow-up. Except for a decline in the level prior to ARC and AIDS, the occurrence of antibodies did not significantly correlate with any pattern of disease progression in 22 patients followed for up to 4 years. Among the 141 HIV risk group members, negative in recombinant HIV ELISA tests, anti-nef antibodies were detected in 7 (5%) individuals. However, an anti-nef antibody response was also seen in 5 of 93 (5%) nonrisk dermatological patients and in 4 of 37 (11%) healthy blood donors. Solitary HIV gag protein antibody responses were most frequent (7%) in the group of individuals at risk for HIV but the majority of anti-nef positive sera did not react with HIV gag proteins. The relatively frequent occurrence of indistinguishable anti-nef antibody responses in nonrisk individuals suggests that immunological cross-reaction between nef and some cellular regulatory protein may occur.\r"

There were no noticeable alterations in the major groups of intestinal bacteria in mice given oral dextran sulfate for 7 days. Likewise, there was no abnormal pathology in the ilea or colons of mice treated for 7 days with oral dextran sulfate. However, after 21 and 38 days, there was a noticeable overgrowth of facultative gram-negative bacilli in the colonic and cecal flora of dextran sulfate-treated mice. This overgrowth appeared to be due to bacterial species in the family Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Escherichia coli. Bacterial overgrowth was accompanied by mild histological alterations in the intestinal mucosa, i.e., blunting of ileal villi and colonic crypts, with mild epithelial cell dysplasia. Thus, oral dextran sulfate was associated with quantitative changes in the mouse intestinal flora, as well as histological changes in the intestinal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The paper provides a brief review of the significance of heterogeneity in sexual behaviour to the transmission dynamics of HIV and the spread of AIDS. It addresses the formulation of mathematical models to encapsulate variability in the rate of sexual partner change, the structure of networks of sexual partner contact, and age dependency in sexual activity. A particular focus is the significance of high or low preference (or choice) of sexual partners from an individual's own sexual activity class (defined on the basis of partner change rate or other criteria). Numerical studies of model behaviour reveal that a high degree of assortativeness (high level of \"like with like\" mixing) results in a more rapid initial spread of HIV, a smaller overall epidemic, and the possibility of a multipeak or long and drawn out epidemic, by comparison with those induced by high degrees of disassortativeness (low level of \"like with like\" mixing) in sexual contact patterns. The structure of a sexual network is shown to be a major determinant of the temporal pattern and magnitude of an epidemic. The demographic impact of HIV in developing countries is also examined in the context of choice matrices based on age as well as sexual activity. The potential demographic impact of AIDS is shown to be enhanced by age dependency in levels of activity (high in the young and lower in older age classes), a male preference for females of younger age, and a higher efficiency of HIV transmission from male to female than vice versa. The paper ends with a discussion of the need for better quantitative data on sexual behaviour.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in sodium-depleted anesthetized monkeys to determine the effects of the primate-selective renin inhibitor A-64662 on renal function. Five groups of monkeys were examined with each group receiving an i.v. infusion of vehicle or A-64662 at doses (bolus plus continuous infusion) of 0.1 + 0.01, 1.0 + 0.1, 10 + 1.0 or 100 micrograms/kg + 10 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6/dose). Plasma renin activity was inhibited (P less than .05) at all infusion doses ranging from 33 +/- 8% at the lowest dose to 95 +/- 3% at the highest dose. Inhibition of plasma renin activity was accompanied by renal vasodilation as renal blood flow (RBF) increased (P less than .05) in a dose-dependent manner beginning at the dose of 1.0 microgram/kg + 0.1 micrograms/kg/min. RBF increased 36 +/- 7% at the highest dose of A-64662 examined. Associated with the increments in RBF, renal vascular resistance progressively decreased (P less than .05) by 12 +/- 3, 31 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 6%, respectively, with increasing doses of A-64662. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged at all doses of A-64662. As a result, a significant (P less than .05) fall in the filtration fraction was observed as the dose of A-64662 increased. Mean arterial pressure was unaffected by the two lowest doses of A-64662, but decreased (P less than 0.05) by 13 +/- 1 and 18 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, at the two highest doses of A-64662 infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The studies were done to determine whether inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin and morphine microinjected into periaqueductal central gray (CG) was mediated by stimulating different types of opioid receptors and by activating different descending pain modulatory systems in rats. beta-Endorphin (0.3-20 micrograms) or morphine (0.3-20 micrograms) microinjected bilaterally into CG produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the tail-flick response. Naloxone (0.3-3 micrograms) injected into CG was more effective in antagonizing inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by CG administered morphine than by beta-endorphin. beta-Endorphin-(1-27) (3 micrograms) injected CG effectively antagonized CG beta-endorphin-induced inhibition of the tail-flick response but slightly potentiated CG morphine-induced inhibition. Intrathecal injection of naloxone (0.3-30 micrograms) dose-dependently reversed inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) but not by morphine (4 micrograms) injected into CG. On the other hand, yohimbine (0.3-30 micrograms) injected intrathecally dose-dependently antagonized inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by morphine (4 micrograms) but not by beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) given into CG. It was concluded that beta-endorphin and morphine produce inhibitions of the tail-flick response by stimulating epsilon and mu opioid receptors, respectively, and the descending pain modulatory system activated by beta-endorphin from CG involves spinal opioid receptors but not alpha-2 adrenoceptors whereas the descending system activated by morphine from CG involves spinal alpha-2 adrenoceptors but not opioid receptors.\r"

Other amino acids evoked [3H]norepinephrine release with a rank order of potency: L-serine greater than or equal to glycine greater than beta-alanine greater than D-serine. Strychnine inhibited [3H]norepinephrine release evoked by both glycine and L-serine, but was less effective in inhibiting the release evoked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid. Inhibitors of the NMDA receptor/ionophore complex, MK-801, CPP and Mg++, as well as the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor antagonist, HA-966, caused an incomplete inhibition (maximum approximately 60%) of glycine-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release. The potencies with which MK-801, CPP and Mg++ inhibited glycine- and NMDA-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release were very similar. The combination of MK-801 plus kynurenic acid, a nonselective glutamate receptor antagonist, caused no greater inhibition of glycine-evoked release than MK-801, alone. omega-Conotoxin GVIA, an inhibitor of neuronal L- and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, inhibited glycine-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release by approximately 50%, whereas the L-channel inhibitor PN 200-110 had no significant effect. The combination of MK-801 plus omega-conotoxin GVIA caused only a slightly greater inhibition (P greater than .05) of glycine-evoked release than MK-801 alone. Tetrodotoxin inhibited glycine-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine by approximately 75%. The inhibitory effects of tetrodotoxin and omega-conotoxin GVIA suggest that voltage-sensitive sodium channels and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels are important mediators of glycine-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) in response to kinins was investigated in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells. The production was estimated by the measurement of the accumulation of cyclic GMP, a response which can be attributed to activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase of the endothelial cells by endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). Bradykinin increased markedly the levels of cyclic GMP in endothelial cells without affecting those of cyclic AMP. The bradykinin-stimulated production of cyclic GMP was transient and concentration-dependent. Kallidin (an agonist at B2-kinin receptors) but not des-Arg9 bradykinin and des-Arg10 kallidin (agonists at B1 kinin receptors) also increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the content of cyclic GMP. The B2 kinin receptor antagonist, D-Arg0 [Hyp3, D-Phe7]bradykinin but not the B1 kinin receptor antagonists Leu8-des-Arg9 bradykinin and Leu9-des-Arg10 kallidin inhibited the production of cyclic GMP upon stimulation of the endothelial cells with either bradykinin or kallidin. Both the basal and kinin (bradykinin and kallidin)-stimulated productions of cyclic GMP were reduced by hemoglobin and potentiated by superoxide dismutase. Methylene blue also reduced kinin-stimulated production of cyclic GMP. These findings suggest that cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells possess B2 kinin receptors which are associated with the production and/or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) produced in turn enhances the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase and induces the accumulation of cyclic GMP.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of angiotensin II and adenosine to this response in normal-salt and salt-deplete states. Intrarenal infusions of hypertonic saline to sodium-deplete dogs caused a renal vaso-constrictor response that was observed between 5 and 10 min into the infusion. This response was attenuated in dogs on a normal-salt diet and in salt-deplete dogs receiving captopril. Intravenous infusion of subpressor doses of angiotensin II to dogs either on a normal-salt intake or on a salt-deplete diet but receiving captopril, restored the vasoconstrictor response to hypertonic saline. The vasoconstrictor response in the presence of an angiotensin II infusion in each of these two groups of dogs was abolished by an intrarenal artery infusion of the adenosine receptor blocker, theophylline. These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that intrarenal infusion of hypertonic saline enhances the endogenous production of adenosine and that the ability of adenosine to reduce renal blood flow is dependent on the presence of angiotensin II.\r"

It did not alter the pressor responses to vasopressin and norepinephrine as well as the heart rate response to isoproterenol. In the anesthetized rat, DuP 753 did not affect the vasodepressor response to bradykinin. Given p.o. or i.v., DuP 753 did not lower blood pressure in conscious normotensive rats, but it inhibited the pressor response to AII but not to vasopressin. It lowered blood pressure in furosemide-treated normotensive rats. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure even at 100 mg/kg i.v. DuP 753 at 3.5 micrograms i.c.v. inhibited the pressor response to i.c.v. AII, whereas DuP 753 at 10 mg/kg p.o. did not, suggesting that a single p.o. administration of DuP 753 does not affect brain AII receptors which are accessible by i.c.v. injection. Our study indicates that DuP 753 is a p.o. active, nonpeptide, selective, competitive AII receptor antagonist.\r"

  ".W": "In conscious renal artery-ligated rats, a high renin hypertensive rat model, DuP 753, a p.o. active nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, decreased blood pressure at 0.1 to 3 mg/kg given i.v. or at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg given p.o. with an i.v. ED30 of given i.v. or at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg given p.o. with an i.v. ED30 of 0.78 mg/kg and a p.o. ED30 of 0.59 mg/kg. The antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was similar to that of captopril. Unlike the peptide AII antagonist saralasin, DuP 753 did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure, suggesting absence of agonistic activity. At 3 mg/kg p.o., DuP 753 lowered blood pressure for at least 24 hr and did not change heart rate, suggesting a long duration of antihypertensive effect. At 3 mg/kg i.v., DuP 753 inhibited the pressor response to AII but not to norepinephrine or vasopressin. Pretreatment of renal artery-ligated rats with captopril, saralasin or propranolol, but not with prazosin, hydralazine or indomethacin, abolished or reduced the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753. In the deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rat, a low renin model, DuP 753 did not lower blood pressure. These results suggest that DuP 753 is a p.o. active, antihypertensive agent in renal artery-ligated rats with a similar antihypertensive efficacy as captopril. The antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 is most likely related to the blockade of the vasoconstrictor effect of AII. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 does not have agonistic activity.\r"

To study the possible molecular correlates of these adaptive changes we compared binding parameters of D1 and D2 receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in striata from normal and reserpinized mice. Saturation curves using [3H]SCH 23390 showed no changes in maximum binding capacity (Bmax) or Kd of striatal D1 receptors taken from control or 5 days reserpine-treated mice. However, [3H]spiperone saturation curves showed a 31% increase in D2 receptors Bmax with no changes in Kd. Dopamine competition of [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiperone binding in mouse striatum was also performed. Analysis of data by LIGAND showed that dopamine recognizes two subpopulations for D1 and for D2 receptors. The proportion of receptors in the high affinity state (D1high and D2high) were increased in reserpine-treated animals. The addition of 100 microM GTP produced a complete conversion of D1high and D2high receptors into their low-affinity states in striata from control and reserpinized mice. Five days of reserpine treatment increased basal adenylate cyclase activity of mouse striatum in the presence of Mn++ or Mg++ ions. Concentration curves with dopamine, NaF or forskolin revealed shifts to the left and higher maximum responses without changes in EC50 values in striata from reserpinized mice. Thus, a prolonged reserpine treatment produces marked changes in D1 and D2 receptors increasing the proportion of high affinity state subpopulations and the total Bmax of D2 receptors. Also, dopamine function may be enhanced through an increment of the catalytic component of striatal adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of chronic administration (18 days) with SCH 23390 (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) and haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day s.c.) on dopamine and serotonin synthesis and metabolism in discrete dopaminergic and serotonergic nuclei of rat brain were studied. Additionally, the effects of these treatments on dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor characteristics in rat caudate-putamen were investigated. Chronic administration with both dose regimens of SCH 23390 decreased DA metabolism significantly (basal homovanillic acid concentrations) in nucleus caudatus. In another set of experiments dopamine synthesis (rate of accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine after 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-decarboxylase inhibition) was reduced significantly only in nucleus accumbens after the higher SCH 23390 dose regimen. In turn, chronic administration with haloperidol decreased basal dopamine metabolism and synthesis in nucleus caudatus and nucleus accumbens. Chronic haloperidol, but not SCH 23390, treatment induced a clear-cut increase in [3H]spiperone binding in caudate-putamen. Interestingly, neither SCH 23390 nor haloperidol treatments affected [3H]SCH 23390 binding in caudate-putamen. SCH 23390 and haloperidol had no significant effects on serotonin synthesis and metabolism in serotonergic and dopaminergic areas. In conclusion, the classical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, clearly decreases dopamine turnover in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. The D-1 antagonist, SCH 23390, also decreases dopaminergic activity in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems although DA synthesis and metabolism are affected to different degrees in nucleus caudatus and nucleus accumbens. Therefore, we suggest that if D-1 antagonists such as SCH 23390 show antipsychotic activity in clinical studies, they may not be free of extrapyramidal side-effects.\r"

The patient had low titer of IgG antiphospholipid antibodies and hypocomplementemia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis, increased protein and decreased glucose. Clinical improvement of the neurologic impairment was noted after high dose corticosteroids and intravenous bolus cyclophosphamide. A repeat MRI 12 days after the treatment was normal. MRI of the spine can be useful in the diagnosis and followup of patients with SLE presenting with an acute myelopathic syndrome. Early aggressive treatment may contribute to complete recovery of these patients.\r"

SB-75 and D-Trp6-LH-RH were administered in the form of microcapsules releasing 25 micrograms/day. The reduction in tumor weights after treatment with SB-75, D-Trp6-LH-RH, D-Trp6-LH-RH plus tamoxifen, or ovariectomy was 84%, 64%, 33%, and 67%, respectively. Tamoxifen alone was ineffective. Histologically, the regressive changes in the treated tumors were characteristic of apoptosis (programmed cell death). In view of its potency and its immediate inhibitory effect, the LH-RH antagonist SB-75 should be considered as a possible new hormonal agent for the treatment of breast cancer.\r"

Five patients treated by the authors and 18 previously reported patients were reviewed to further define the characteristics of A. hydrophila wound infections. Although Aeromonas has been isolated from salt and brackish water, all 23 cases occurred following contact with fresh water. Signs of infection usually appeared 8-48 hours following puncture or laceration injury. The foot or leg were most commonly involved. Infection was frequently rapidly progressive; fascia, tendon, muscle, bone, or joint involvement occurred in 39% of cases. In addition to A. hydrophila, other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 48% of cases. Aeromonas infection should be suspected in cases of early and rapidly progressive wound infection following trauma in fresh water. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and appropriate surgical care should be promptly instituted.\r"

  ".W": "The literature on the neuropsychology, personality, and psychopathology of alcoholism and addiction is reviewed. Neuropsychological studies of substance abusers have found deficits in abstract concept formation, set-maintenance, set-shifting, behavioral control, and cognitive flexibility. However, the evidence that these deficits are the result of direct substance effects on the brain is slim. Both alcoholics and as-yet nondrinking offspring of alcoholics have been found to be deficient in verbal skills and language functioning. Personality studies of alcoholics and addicts have emphasized such characteristics as field dependency, external locus of control, attenuated time extension, poor ego strength, and disturbed object relations. The psychopathology of alcoholics and opiate abusers seems to be dominated by impulsive character disorder, although there may also be a subgroup of anxious, depressed substance abusers. The present review integrates brain-behavioral perspectives with the data on personality and psychopathology, focusing on the relevance of a multidimensional neuropsychological model to psychodynamic concepts of ego functioning and the substance abusers' problems in the regulation of affect and behavior. It is argued that the concept of cognitive style is useful for understanding the relationship of neuropsychological functioning to personality dynamics, and that this approach can be especially productive in understanding the addictions.\r"

Immunotoxicology is defined as an adverse response of the immune system to a chemical or drug which may result in disease such as autoimmunity, immune suppression, allergy or other hypersensitivity states. Occasionally, immune enhancement is the end result. Because many of the immune system's cellular and humoral components can be isolated and studied in vitro, assays have been developed to study the immunotoxic effects of chemicals. Further refinement of these in vitro studies is required along with clinical investigations into the effects of chemicals on the immune system of humans. Extrapolating from the animal data to human effects has proven to be unsuccessful in many circumstances. Further definition and study of immunotoxic responses as contrasted with normal immune responses to neo-antigens are required to investigate actual disease causation.\r"

A recent increase in popularity of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has resulted in an increased availability in the home with resulting heightened probability of accidental ingestion of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors by children. In response to this we did a retrospective study of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ingestions in children (ages 1-5 years) from two regional poison centers certified by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. The records of the Delaware Valley Regional Poison Control Center and the New Jersey Poison Information Education Systems were reviewed for 1986 and 1987. Forty-eight angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor exposures in children 1-5 were identified. Twenty exposures (12.5-300mg captopril, 5-15mg enalapril) were managed with syrup of ipecac in a hospital emergency room. All 20 remained asymptomatic for their stay. None required admission to the hospital. Seven exposures (12.5-75mg captopril, 5-10mg enalapril) were managed at home with syrup of ipecac and 1-, 4-, 24-hour follow up by telephone. All 7 remained asymptomatic. 16 exposures (12.5-100mg captopril, 5-30mg enalapril) were managed by phone at home with observation alone and 4-6 hour follow up. All 16 remained asymptomatic. Five exposures were lost to follow up. A larger series is needed to determine risk, but home monitoring seems adequate for children ingesting no more than the therapeutic dose for adults (12.5-100 mg captopril, 5-30 mg enalapril).\r"

However, major side-effects of DFO treatment have been observed and the drug may accumulate in dialysis patients receiving repeated doses. In recent years, it has been reported that some dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids such as succinic, malic or citric may be considered as possible alternatives to DFO in the management of aluminum accumulation. Ethylene-di-(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid)-like compounds may also have potential as alternatives to DFO in the treatment of aluminum accumulation and aluminum-induced toxicity. Investigation of new therapeutic agents with lower toxicity than DFO and clinical advantages in administration and cost is clearly encouraged.\r"

The mean error in a preliminary series with known volumes of 10 to 175 ml. was 18%. Statistical analysis of these data shows that an unknown bladder volume in milliliters can be calculated from the measurement of 2 sagittal bladder diameters, the height and depth, by the formula volume (ml.) = 5.3 X (height X depth) - 21. This equation when applied to measurements of a series of unknown bladder volumes had a mean error of 16%. Transrectal ultrasonic measurement of residual urine volumes (mostly those less than 175 ml.) provides a useful complement to visualization of the prostate by transrectal ultrasound.\r"

For those with active transitional cell carcinoma diagnostic accuracy comparing fresh to fixed specimens was improved from 58 to 92% with urine and from 50 to 100% with washing samples. For patients with a history of transitional cell carcinoma who currently are free of disease the false positive rate remains unchanged after fixation. The procedure described is suitable for use in the outpatient clinic and should permit shipping of samples without refrigeration to a central flow cytometry facility for analysis.\r"

We found that ultrasonic characteristics of the normal prostate and its surrounding tissues could be predicted accurately by knowledge of the histology of these structures. Histological sections of 100 prostates from patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound and subsequent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were examined. The congenital anatomical variations observed in this group are described histologically and sonographically. Caudal formation of the ejaculatory ducts within the central zone occurred in 18% of the cases, abnormal posterior penetration of the ejaculatory ducts at the rectal surface in 12% and abnormally large muscle bundles with the ejaculatory duct sheath in 6%. Concomitant ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicle dilatation was observed in 5% of the patients, whereas dilated ejaculatory ducts alone, dilated seminal vesicles alone and cystic utricles each were seen in 2%.\r"

We present a case of severe bladder contracture, documented radiographically and urodynamically after 8 weekly intravesical instillations of doxorubicin. The patient subsequently underwent cystectomy because of voiding dysfunction and the specimen demonstrated marked fibrosis in the bladder wall. We postulate that a benign, recurrent bladder ulceration during doxorubicin therapy may have potentiated the fibrotic response in the bladder to the doxorubicin. Objective monitoring of bladder capacity should be considered in patients treated with intravesical chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "90189383\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the influence of unrepaired technical defects as well as systemic risk factors for atherogenesis on carotid artery healing after endarterectomy, we conducted a prospective study using intraoperative duplex scanning with spectral analysis to establish the initial status of the artery (N = 131 arteries), and then we studied these vessels at regular postoperative intervals with the same technique (N = 108 arteries, 265 studies). The vessels were divided into the operated and nonoperated segments of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and both intraoperative image and flow data were tabulated by artery segment. The technical factors that were analyzed included defect size, defect type, adjacent segment defects, number of defects, shunt use, vessel reopening, and peak, mean, and end-diastolic frequency and velocity. The systemic risk factors studied were sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, randomly drawn total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and perioperative aspirin and dextran use. Data were analyzed by linear logistic regression analysis. Among the technical factors, only intraoperative defect size was significantly associated with risk of recurrent stenosis (p = 0.0175). Although any defect size adversely affected the condition of the vessel during follow-up, the magnitude of this effect was small for smaller defects (size category 1: less than or equal to 40% stenosis or flap length less than or equal to 25% of vessel diameter). The systemic factors that were associated with risk of recurrent stenosis were hypertension (p = 0.0002), smoking (p = 0.0016), and randomly drawn total serum cholesterol level (p = 0.0116). The fact that the operated segments consistently fared worse during follow-up than did the nonoperated segments (p = 0.0044) undoubtedly reflects the inevitable trauma of the endarterectomy, but also emphasizes the important contribution of systemic risk factors in recurrent carotid stenosis. Risk factor modification may be the most effective method of ensuring the durability of carotid endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of type I diabetes mellitus is hindered by the often large fluctuations in blood glucose concentration experienced by affected individuals. To determine to what extent day-to-day variation in blood glucose levels can be reduced if insulin is injected in the same anatomic region rather than in different regions using a rotational scheme, as is commonly recommended, 12 type I diabetic subjects were studied. Insulin injections were given in the abdomen for 3 days and rotated among arms, abdomen, and thighs for 3 days using a crossover design with random assignment of treatment order. Blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose levels were obtained at nine scheduled times on each day. Insulin dose, diet, and physical activity were held constant for each subject. During the abdominal injection period, the mean SD of plasma glucose levels and the mean variance of plasma glucose levels were both less at all nine time points than during the rotating injection period. Overall values for the SD of plasma glucose levels were 2.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L for the abdominal injection period and 3.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L for the rotating injection period. Overall values for the variance of plasma glucose levels were 9.2 +/- 1.4 mmol2/L2 for the abdominal injection period and 17.4 +/- 2.2 mmol2/L2 for the rotating injection period. We conclude that the common clinical practice of rotating the anatomic regions used for insulin injections increases day-to-day variation in blood glucose concentration. Use of a single anatomic region, eg, the abdomen, for all insulin injections may reduce this variation and allow greater precision in the adjustment of insulin doses.\r"

The results showed that endothelin is a potent stimulus of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) synthesis by bovine mesangial cells. Percentage increases in eicosanoid synthesis induced by endothelin (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), were 50 to 275% for PGE2, 28 to 168% for PGI2 and 42 to 111% for TxA2, respectively. Endothelin-induced eicosanoid synthesis in mesangial cells was concentration, but not time dependent. Aspirin (500 microM) completely prevented endothelin-induced eicosanoid synthesis. The calcium entry blocker nitrendipine (10(-8) M) failed to inhibit endothelin-induced eicosanoid synthesis. These data suggest that endothelin-induced changes in renal circulation and glomerular function in normal and disease conditions may be modulated by the concomitant stimulation of mesangial eicosanoid synthesis.\r"

Imaging of the cortex is achieved by iodine-131-labeled iodomethyl nor-cholesterol (NP-59), while adrenal medulla imaging can be successfully accomplished by 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), which localizes in the adrenergic nerve terminal with norepinephrine. Both tests carry high sensitivity and specificity for functional tumors and hyperplasia, and often better than CT scanning. This article reviews the current status and clinical utility of nuclear imaging of the adrenal cortex in congenital hyperplasia, low renin hypertension and aldosteronism, and Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal medulla imaging is reviewed in light of our experience at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, and other neuroectodermal tumors. Investigation of 131I-MIBG therapy of metastatic tumors of neuroectodermal origin potentially offers a means of at least controlling symptoms of hormonal secretion in these patients.\r"

Such late recurrence is accomplished by the cancer cell entering a \"dormant\" state in which little or no de novo DNA transcription occurs and only enough RNA is translated into proteins to maintain the vegetative functions that sustain cell viability. Features favoring the evolvement of dormancy are discussed as well as the nature of the cocoon-like shell which affords such cancer cells protection from the host's cellular and serological defenses. Speculation, promoted by the new cellular biology, as to the cause of secondary inflammatory cancers, is presented. A possible mechanism for the reactivation of these quiescent cells is suggested. The altered immune reactions of host and cancer cells provide an explanation for the controversies plaguing surgeons regarding the treatment and prognosis of breast cancer.\r"

Before surgical intervention, the principal use of sonography is to assess the patency of the extrahepatic portal vein because a narrowed or thrombosed portal vein may preclude transplantation. Postoperatively, several potential complications can lead to allograft dysfunction (rejection, infection, vascular thromboses, and biliary tract complications). Because these complications often manifest with variable and nonspecific symptoms, diagnosing them can be difficult. Sonography is a valuable noninvasive means of evaluating postoperative complications in liver transplant patients. When vascular complications are suspected, duplex sonography is the optimal screening procedure for assessment of the vascular anastomoses. Focal parenchymal abnormalities (hematomas, infarcts, and bilomas) and localized collections of abdominal fluid are readily detected by ultrasonography and can be safely aspirated and, when infected, percutaneously drained under sonographic guidance. Sonography is less useful in the detection of biliary tract complications early after transplantation.\r"

The combination of silent ischemia and ischemia associated with angina is referred to as total ischemic burden. Silent ischemia is prognostically important for identifying patients in whom subsequent myocardial events may develop. The episodes of silent ischemia, and thus total ischemic burden, can be reduced by standard antianginal therapy, a measure that may have a favorable influence on patient outcome.

Most of these patients require immediate catheterization and subsequent intervention with intra-aortic balloon pulsation, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting. An entire spectrum of manifestations exists between these two extremes.

Although the isolated left subclavian artery produces the hemodynamic alterations of a subclavian steal, review of the 39 cases reported in the literature revealed only 5 patients with symptoms suggestive of vertebrobasilar insufficiency and 5 patients with weakness of the left upper extremity. Although the patient we describe had no known heart disease, congenital heart disease was present in 23 of the 39 reported cases (59%), tetralogy of Fallot occurring most frequently.\r"

  ".W": "Helicobacter pylori (formerly, Campylobacter pylori) is a gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium with a strong affinity for gastric-type epithelium. Convincing evidence indicates that H. pylori plays an etiologic role in the development of chronic, nonspecific gastritis, and it may play an important role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease. An etiologic role for this organism in chronic gastric ulceration, nonulcer dyspepsia, and gastric carcinoma is not established. Whereas the diagnosis of H. pylori infection is relatively straightforward, the questions of when and how to treat the infection do not have established answers. A high rate of recrudescence follows most currently used therapeutic interventions. Until the pathogenicity of H. pylori in clinical disease is further supported and additional treatment trials have been completed, a conservative management approach is recommended.\r"
