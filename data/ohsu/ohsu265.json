  ".W": "Humans treated with the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone may develop pulmonary toxicity accompanied by the presence of alveolar macrophages (AM) containing lamellar inclusions. This cellular response is indicative of the development of a drug-induced phospholipidosis. To characterize this response of the AM, Fischer-344 rats were treated with amiodarone, and the macrophages were recovered by pulmonary lavage. The development of phospholipidosis was dose- and time-dependent and was reversible. Daily treatment for 1 wk (5 days/wk) at 150 mg/kg resulted in a 5-fold increase in total phospholipid in the cells. Phospholipid levels were increased only slightly more through 9 wk of treatment. Cells were filled with lamellar inclusions and contained areas of amorphous granular and membranous material. Individual classes of phospholipids were all increased during the development of phospholipidosis. When expressed as mumol/10(7) cells, phosphatidylcholine demonstrated the largest increase. Levels of amiodarone and its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, increased in AM in parallel with the increase in phospholipid. From 3 days through 9 wk of treatment, the level of desethylamiodarone was always higher than that of amiodarone. Treatment with desethylamiodarone also induced phospholipidosis in AM. Administration of phenobarbital along with amiodarone for 1 wk caused a reduction in the levels of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, and phospholipid in the cells. The molar ratio of amiodarone to phospholipid was decreased, whereas the molar ratio of desethylamiodarone to phospholipid remained unchanged. Taken together, the results indicate that, along with amiodarone, desethylamiodarone and/or its metabolites may play an important role in the phospholipidosis induced in AM when rats are treated with amiodarone.\r"

In alveolar type II epithelial cells, extracellular myoinositol has been used to suppress phosphatidylglycerol synthesis, presumably by competing with glycerol-3-P for a common pool of CDP-diacylglycerol. We sought to see if extracellular lactate would increase acetate incorporation into phosphatidylglycerol by increasing glycerol-3-P. Lactate and 10 mM cytidine increased acetate incorporation into phosphatidylglycerol, whereas myoinositol and pyruvate decreased acetate incorporation into phosphatidylglycerol. Lactate increased the intracellular content of glycerol-3-P. We conclude that phosphatidylglycerol synthesis can, in part, be regulated by intracellular glycerol-3-P concentration, and we speculate that extracellular (alveolar) lactate may increase glycerol-3-P concentration in alveolar type II cells in vivo.\r"

Immunocytologic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to cytokeratins and with those to adult type II cells (JBR-1) demonstrated that the cell cultures were composed almost entirely of epithelial type II cells. Additional evidence that the cultures had the type II phenotype was obtained by Maclura pomifera lectin binding studies and by positive immunocytochemical demonstration of surfactant apoproteins. Comparison of cell cultures established from fetal lung at the early canalicular and saccular stages of rat lung development revealed that early fetal type II cells (Day 19) contained much glycogen and few lamellar bodies. The reverse was observed in type II cells isolated from fetal lungs at 21 days of gestation. Immunohistochemically determined surfactant apoproteins showed a similar developmental pattern to lamellar bodies. The cell cultures exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, but this did not increase with development. Administration of dexamethasone to pregnant rats at 19 days gestation resulted in a significant loss of glycogen from fetal type II cells isolated 24 h later. This decrease in glycogen content was accompanied by an increase in the number of cells containing lamellar bodies. These findings indicate that freshly isolated fetal type II cells retain the morphologic features of the type II cells in vivo and provide a good system for the study of biochemical events occurring in these cells during specific stages of lung development.\r"

In all 3 models examined, there was at least a 3-fold elevation in both ACE activity and total protein levels. However, determination of enzyme activity relative to total protein content (enzyme specific activity) revealed contrasting patterns. High dose intratracheal bleomycin instillation (500 micrograms) induced an increase in ACE activity relative to total protein. When a lower dose of bleomycin (50 micrograms) or when a 30-h exposure to 100% oxygen were used, both ACE and protein increased but enzyme specific activity did not change. In contrast, exposure to 100% oxygen for 48 h or to alpha-naphthylthiourea, an agent that rapidly induces protein edema without cell injury, caused a decrease in enzyme specific activity. The enzyme found in lavage fluid in these models is identical to the lung tissue enzyme with respect to cofactor requirements, inhibition by captopril, and has an apparent molecular weight of 175 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These studies clearly refute the null hypothesis that lavage ACE levels in the injured lung merely reflect altered bulk protein transmigration.\r"

  ".U": "88148574\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary influxed neutrophils have been suggested to be involved in the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We recently revealed that a highly toxic substance, 9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoate, is biosynthesized by human neutrophils, thus it was named leukotoxin. Because hyperoxia-induced lung injury is a model of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), this study was designed to investigate whether or not leukotoxin is involved in the genesis of pulmonary oxygen toxicity and ARDS. After exposure to hyperoxia for 60 h, rats showed acute pulmonary edema, which was evidenced by increased lung weight, albumin concentrations, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities in lung lavages. These changes were correlated with an increased number of neutrophils. We detected leukotoxin in lung lavages of rats after exposure to hyperoxia for 60 h by high performance liquid chromatography and gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. After intravenous injection of leukotoxin (100 mumol/kg) to rats, acute edematous lung injury occurred showing increases in lung weight, lung lavage albumin concentrations, and lung lavage ACE activities. In the lung lavages obtained from 5 patients with ARDS, significant increases in albumin concentrations and ACE activities were observed compared with those from subjects without pulmonary disease. Moreover, considerable amounts of leukotoxin, 38.5 +/- 21.9 nmol/lung lavage, were observed in the lavages from patients with ARDS. These findings suggest that leukotoxin plays an important role in the genesis of acute edematous lung damage in pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and that leukotoxin also links with the development of lung injury observed in patients with ARDS.\r"

The present report describes the histopathologic changes in guinea-pig lung and trachea at various time intervals after ovalbumin inhalation in nonsensitized (control) and sensitized animals. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was also used to assess the accompanying accumulation of intraluminal leukocytes. A distinct leukocyte margination, consisting of neutrophils and eosinophils, was observed in the peribronchial vasculature as early as 8 min postchallenge in sensitized guinea pigs. At 6 h, the eosinophils predominated and migrated to the peribronchiolar smooth muscle layer. Between 6 h and 18 h, eosinophils were seen in tracts between the smooth muscle cell layers, accumulating in large numbers in the bronchial mucosal epithelium. This pattern persisted for at least 7 days postchallenge during which eosinophils remained the dominant cell type present. Peribronchiolar accumulation of neutrophils and mononuclear cells was minimal at all time points studied. Intraluminal mucus eosinophilia developed between 18 h and 7 days. A similar pattern of eosinophil infiltration was observed in the tracheal epithelium. Control, nonsensitized, guinea-pig lungs showed minor changes with little or no eosinophil infiltration at any time after antigen challenge. These findings correlated well with the BAL study in which sensitized guinea pigs exhibited a marked delayed increase in eosinophil counts between 18 h and 7 days compared with that in nonsensitized animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We describe a guinea pig model of asthma in which animals were sensitized and challenged by inhalation of aerosolized ovalbumin. Challenge was performed under cover of mepyramine (10 mg/kg) to allow a high enough concentration of ovalbumin to elicit consistent late responses. Airway resistance and thoracic gas volume of conscious guinea pigs was assessed by whole body plethysmography before and at regular intervals for as long as 72 h after challenge. At the same time points, cellular changes in the lung were assessed by both examination of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung histology. There were no significant changes in specific airway conductance (SGaw), BAL cell content or lung histology in animals challenged with saline control. Challenge with 2% ovalbumin caused an early fall in SGaw, which peaked at 2 h and amounted to a 43.7 +/- 4.1% fall from baseline. This was followed by 2 late responses, the first reaching maximum at 17 h with a 46.9 +/- 4.5% decrease in SGaw from baseline and the second at 72 h with a 39.0 +/- 3.5% fall in SGaw. Examination of BAL fluid revealed a 7-fold increase in neutrophils at 6 h and a 17-fold increase at 17 h, after which numbers decreased to baseline. Eosinophilia developed more slowly, being insignificant at 6 h and 6-fold at 17 h; by 72 h, eosinophils constituted 48.9 +/- 6.9% of the total cells recovered. No changes in mononuclear cells or lymphocytes were observed. Histologic examination of the lung revealed a progressive eosinophil infiltration of the airways, but not alveoli or vascular bed. Electron microscopy showed degranulation of eosinophils recovered by BAL and discharge of mucus from goblet cells in the trachea. Because these changes are similar to those that occur after allergen challenge in human asthma, we suggest that this represents a useful animal model in which to study the mechanism of early and late bronchoconstriction responses.\r"

However, the relationship between the severity of the initial phase of acute injury and alveolitis and the amount of subsequent chronic inflammation and fibrosis remains unclear. We induced a wide spectrum of acute lung injury in rabbits by using various amounts of intratracheal bleomycin (5 or 10 U/kg) with and without oxygen supplementation (100% O2 for 2 min). The arterial oxygen tension on Day 12 after the bleomycin correlated with the extent of acute lung injury, as well as with the amount of chronic inflammation and fibrosis present on Day 56, as determined by physiologic parameters (lung volume, DLCO/VA, and PO2), and morphometry (volume proportions abnormal parenchyma made up of intra-alveolar macrophages, intra-alveolar granulocytes, abnormal alveoli, abnormal airways, fibrosis, consolidation, and honeycombing). We conclude that in bleomycin-induced interstitial lung disease in the rabbit, there is a direct relationship between the severity of acute lung injury after intratracheal bleomycin and the amount of subsequent chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This suggests that the mechanisms regulating the development of fibrosis are directly influenced by the extent of initial injury.\r"

To gain insights into the mechanisms leading to the increased density of fibroblasts and altered collagen metabolism in the IPF lung, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from normal subjects and patients with IPF or sarcoidosis was analyzed for (1) the presence of antigenic material related to the aminoterminal propeptide domain of type III procollagen, and (2) fibroblast growth-promoting activity in the extracellular milieu of the lower respiratory tract. Whereas bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) type III procollagen aminoterminal peptide-related antigen levels in 59 patients with sarcoidosis were similar to the levels of control subjects (p greater than 0.10), 31 patients with IPF had markedly increased levels (12-fold over controls; p less than 0.025, IPF versus controls; p less than 0.01, IPF versus sarcoidosis). Type III procollagen aminoterminal peptide-related antigen levels correlated with an increase in the ability of BALF to stimulate fibroblast proliferation (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, BALF from patients with IPF markedly stimulated human lung fibroblast proliferation in vitro (199% increase, p less than 0.01), whereas lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis and from control subjects did not. The enhanced fibroblast proliferation induced by IPF BALF occurred in the absence of serum and exogenous growth factors, suggesting that both competence- and progression-type growth factors were present in the lavage fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This alteration is likely the result of both increased fibroblast proliferation and abnormalities in fibroblast collagen metabolism. Although the development of pulmonary fibrosis is preceded by inflammatory events in the lung, it is unclear whether altered fibroblast behavior requires continuous exposure to inflammatory mediators or alternatively results from the emergence in the lung of fibroblast populations possessing characteristics such as to explain the abnormalities seen in pulmonary fibrosis. To examine the latter hypothesis, we have established a number of fibroblast cell lines from control (C) lung tissue as well as from tissue from patients with active pulmonary fibrosis (PF), and have examined their in vitro proliferative characteristics. Our data show that PF fibroblasts proliferate significantly faster compared to C fibroblasts under standard culture conditions. We have also examined the in vitro proliferative characteristics of a substantial number of clonally derived fibroblasts. We report that a marked heterogeneity exists in terms of proliferation and also that a small but significant number of fast-growing clones are present in panels of clones derived from fibrotic tissue. These data suggest that there exists in fibrotic tissue, clones of fibroblasts with intrinsic growth characteristics which could in itself explain the increased fibroblast proliferation seen in pulmonary fibrosis. The fibrotic clones may emerge as dominant in the fibrotic lung under conditions of injury and repair likely to favor the expansion of this phenotype.\r"

One of the major secretory products of the alveolar type II epithelial cells, pulmonary surfactant, can be recovered by lavage. Abnormalities in alveolar type II cells are found in biopsies of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and abnormalities of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids have been reported after diffuse lung injury in animals and in humans. Therefore, we questioned if abnormalities in lavage phospholipids might also occur in IPF, a chronic inflammatory disease of the alveolar epithelium and interstitium, and, if present, would these abnormalities reflect histopathologic changes or predict responsiveness to therapy. Fifteen untreated patients with IPF, diagnosed by open lung biopsy, were studied and were found to have less than half the amount of bronchoalveolar lavage phospholipid as that recovered from healthy volunteers (p less than 0.05). In addition, patients with IPF had a lower proportion of phosphatidylglycerol and a higher proportion of phosphatidylinositol in the recovered phospholipids than did healthy volunteers (p less than 0.05). The severity of these alterations in phospholipid composition correlated with more advanced fibrotic histopathologic changes. Patients with less depression of total phospholipids in lavage improved with corticosteroid therapy, whereas the patients with more severely decreased total phospholipid recovered in lavage did not.\r"

No symptoms or increases in mediators or protein were observed after placebo challenge. Symptom scores increased in a dose-dependent manner, however, in response to bradykinin challenge. Increased symptoms were associated with significant increases in albumin and TAME-esterase activity, but no increases in histamine were observed. Nasal conductance measurements confirmed that bradykinin induces dose-dependent unilateral obstruction in the challenged nostril. Other common symptoms were rhinorrhea and, of particular relevance to rhinovirus infections, a persistent sore throat. We conclude that bradykinin causes increased vascular permeability and rhinitis, which are independent of mast cell mediator release. Kinins may, therefore, contribute to the symptomatology of inflammatory reactions of the upper airways, including the common cold.\r"

The subjects were challenged first with allergen and then with aerosols of distilled water and of normal saline in random order on separate days. We measured nasal airway resistance (Rn) by posterior rhinomanometry, measured the concentrations of protein, histamine, leukotrienes (LT) B4, C4, and D4, and platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) and performed total and differential cell counts in nasal lavage fluid obtained before and after each challenge. Allergen challenge provoked a 2-fold or greater increase in nasal airway resistance in all subjects (mean increase = 12.2-fold). This response was associated with significant increases in protein, histamine, LTB4, and sulfidopeptide leukotrienes. 2-lyso-PAF-acether increased significantly, indicating activation of phospholipase A2, but PAF-acether was detected in only one subject.

Saline insufflation provoked insignificant changes in mean Rn, in the levels of protein and all inflammatory mediators, and in the number and types of cells in nasal lavage fluid. Distilled water insufflation also provoked an insignificant increase in mean Rn, but there was a 14-fold increase in one subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neutrophil alveolitis was evident as early as 0.5 h after microembolization and was maximal at 4 h (4.9 +/- 1.5% neutrophils of total BAL cells at baseline versus 26.2 +/- 2.8% at 4 h post-thrombin). Neutrophils obtained both at baseline (isolated from peripheral blood) and at 0.5 to 24 h after thrombin (isolated from BAL) did not demonstrate significant basal production of superoxide anion (O2-) and produced similar amounts of O2- upon challenge with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 200 micrograms/ml. The basal O2- production by alveolar macrophages was also not increased. However, alveolar macrophages recovered after fibrin microembolization produced greater amounts of O2- (29.1 +/- 6.3 nm O2-/10(6) cells at 0.5 h) after challenge with PMA compared with alveolar macrophages recovered prior to embolization (10.6 +/- 1.6 nm O2-/10(6) cells baseline), suggesting that thrombin-induced microembolization primes alveolar macrophages and enhances their O2- generation. Neutrophil chemotactic activity was detected in BAL fluid at 0.5 h post-microembolization and reached a peak level at 2 h. Alveolar macrophages were a source of the chemotactic activity since conditioned medium obtained from 2-h post-thrombin macrophages induced neutrophil chemotaxis, whereas baseline cells did not. The addition of the thrombin to macrophages did not result in the generation of chemotactic activity from baseline macrophages, indicating that macrophages were activated during the process of intravascular coagulation rather than by thrombin per se. Post-thrombin BAL fluid also stimulated O2- generation from sheep neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to determine if differences in mediator concentrations correlated with airway responsiveness or with atopy, we studied 3 separate groups: 6 atopic, asthmatic subjects; 6 atopic, nonasthmatic subjects; and 6 nonatopic, nonasthmatic normal subjects. In addition, to determine if the presence of the catheter itself was a stimulus, we studied 6 atopic, asthmatic subjects after exposure to isotonic sodium chloride alone (sham exposure). Lavage specimens were assayed for PGD2, PGF2 alpha, PGE2, TxB2, LTC4, and LTB4 by radioimmunoassay and for histamine by the modified single isotope enzymatic assay. The histamine concentration of the baseline lavage samples (bronchoalveolar lavage and isolated airway segment lavage) for the subjects with asthma were significantly greater than for the atopic or normal subjects (p less than 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between histamine concentration in the lavage samples and the airway responsiveness of the subjects (r = -0.53, p less than 0.0001). There was a marked correlation among the concentrations of histamine, PGD2, PGF2 alpha, and TxB2 in all the lavage fluids for the subjects with asthma (p less than 0.03 for all comparisons and p less than 0.0001 for overall concordance). As a result of hyperosmolar challenge, there was a significant increase in the concentration of histamine, PGD2, and PGF2 alpha in the subjects with asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were performed on 11 normal subjects before and after topical anesthesia of the larynx. The PFT consisted of flow volume loops and body box determinations of functional residual capacity and airway resistance, each performed in triplicate. After the first set of tests, cotton pledgets soaked in 4% lidocaine were held in the pyriform sinuses for 2 min to block the superior laryngeal nerves. In addition, 1.5 ml of 10% cocaine was dropped on the vocal cords via indirect laryngoscopy. PFT were repeated 5 min after anesthesia. Besides routine analysis of the flow volume loops, areas under the inspiratory (Area I) and expiratory (Area E) portions of the loops were calculated by planimetry. Area I, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), as well as forced inspiratory flow at 25, 50, and 75% forced vital capacity (FVC), decreased after anesthesia. Peak expiratory flow decreased after anesthesia, but Area E and forced expiratory flow at 25, 50, and 75% FVC were unchanged. This protocol also was performed in 12 normal subjects with isotonic saline being substituted for the lidocaine and cocaine. In this group, no significant differences were observed when flow volume loop parameters were compared before and after topical application of saline. In 5 spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs, posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and afferent superior laryngeal nerve activity were recorded before and after laryngeal anesthesia performed with the same procedure used in the human subjects. Laryngeal anesthesia resulted in a substantial decrease or a complete disappearance of afferent SLN activity recorded during unobstructed and obstructed respiration. The data suggest that laryngeal receptors help modulate upper airway patency in man.\r"

(2) When diaphragmatic fatigue occurs in such patients, does theophylline prevent or delay its onset? Eight eucapnic patients with moderately severe COPD were subjected to 2 different stresses to the point of severe dyspnea requiring cessation of the stress. The stresses were cycle exercise and inspiratory resistive breathing, the latter requiring a tidal Pdi equal to 60% of Pdimax. Despite incapacitating dyspnea, objective evidence of diaphragmatic fatigue was not encountered during cycle exercise. During inspiratory resistive breathing, diaphragmatic fatigue was encountered in all patients as defined by consistent inability to attain a target Pdi during final moments of the resistance run. Patients were uniformly extremely dyspneic at this point. In neither stressful maneuver did oral sustained-release theophylline show a convincing or significant advantage over placebo when administered in a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. These results suggest that the diaphragmatic fatigue encountered in this sort of COPD patient may be of predominantly central rather than peripheral (myogenic) origin and that theophylline may not be effective in this type of fatigue.\r"

Enhancement of tidal volume, long recognized in pregnancy, was achieved usually by augmentation of rib cage volume displacement. By contrast, abdominal volume displacement during quiet breathing is not altered in a predictable fashion by the gravid state. Given these findings, we hypothesize that the increased diaphragmatic contraction of pregnancy is accompanied by the transmission of that force to the lower rib cage via the area of apposition and that diaphragmatic contraction accounts for enhancement of the tidal breath. Diminished abdominal compliance might contribute to the augmentation of rib cage volume displacement as well. Konno-Mead diagrams suggest that this hypothesis is true in some, but not all, subjects.\r"

Although diaphragmatic weakness was demonstrated during the voluntary maneuvers, transdiaphragmatic pressures recorded during phrenic nerve stimulation were normal. These findings indicate that diaphragmatic dysfunction, probably caused by ataxia during voluntary maneuvers, may occur in association with cerebellar atrophy. In the presence of diaphragmatic weakness, normal values of transdiaphragmatic pressure during phrenic nerve stimulation may suggest an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the diaphragm.\r"

Transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi) during quiet breathing did not show any remarkable change after the operation (9.5 +/- 1.1 to 10.9 +/- 1.0 cm H2O), while the ratio of abdominal to transdiaphragmatic pressure changes (delta Pab/delta Pdi) revealed a significant difference between the preoperative and the early postoperative periods (0.32 +/- 0.06 to 0.00 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.05). The postoperative delta Pab/delta Pdi correlated significantly with the work of breathing (r = -0.60, p less than 0.01). The maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax) decreased significantly after operation (75.0 +/- 15.8 to 32.8 +/- 12.4 cm H2O, p less than 0.05), with no significant change in the maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (MIP) (74.2 +/- 16.8 to 39.5 +/- 11.6 cm H2O). Four of 20 patients developed respiratory failure postoperatively and required mechanical ventilation. delta Pab/delta Pdi in these patients was significantly lower than in the other patients (-0.62 +/- 0.24 versus 0.16 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.005). Our results suggested that during quiet breathing diaphragmatic function was preserved and intercostal/accessory muscles recruitment increased, but maximal strength of the diaphragm might be reduced in patients undergoing pulmonary resection.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were pretreated with various inducers of cytochrome P-450 before being exposed to pure normobaric oxygen (O2) in order to determine whether the inducers interfere with toxicity. The pulmonary and liver inducers beta-naphthoflavone (beta NF) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) increased the survival rate and decreased the amount of pleural and lung fluid accumulation in adult rats exposed to oxygen. Phenobarbital (PB), which is essentially active in the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450, was less effective in counteracting oxygen toxicity. After 7 days of exposure to oxygen, none of the untreated rats survived, whereas 40, 73, and 90% survival was observed in rats treated with PB, 3MC, and beta NF, respectively. After 60 h of O2 exposure, significantly less pleural and lung fluid accumulation was observed in beta NF- and 3MC-treated rats than in untreated or PB-treated rats (p less than 0.001). Both beta NF and 3MC prevented the increase of lung peroxidation (assessed by measuring of malondialdehyde) and that of hydrogen peroxide production by lung microsomes induced by O2 exposure. These protective effects are associated with a large increase in the components of the pulmonary cytochrome P-450 system and its peroxidase activity and with an increased response to hyperoxia by lung antioxidant enzyme activities. In contrast, in control rats, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were not increased, and both the quantity and the peroxidase activity of cytochrome P-450 were significantly decreased by O2 exposure. We conclude that in the rat, pretreatment by inducers of pulmonary cytochrome P-450 results in marked protection against O2 toxicity and an increase of antioxidant enzyme response to hyperoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After local anesthesia of the hypopharynx by topical application of 4% xylocaine, a double-sleeve microbiology specimen brush was introduced into a flexible bronchoscope placed in the trachea. The brush was left in direct contact with the bronchial mucosa for 20 to 30 s to allow mucus to collect on it. The mucus sample was then scraped from the brush and immediately covered with paraffin oil. Its viscoelastic properties were determined by the magnetic microrheometer technique. Excluding the time to anesthetize, the whole procedure took less than 1 min (thus minimizing the effect of cough) and resulted in sufficient mucus for rheologic analysis in approximately 90% of trials, i.e., 2.1 +/- 1.5 (SD) mg. Mucus specimens were collected from 20 fasting healthy nonsmoking subjects; 17 of them returned for a second collection several days later. Values for mucus mechanical impedance (vector sum of elasticity and viscosity) at 1 rad/s were: Control 1, 141 +/- 41 (SE); Control 2, 155 +/- 58 dyn/cm2. There was a large variation in mucus viscoelasticity, both between subjects (CV, 130%) and within the same subject (CV, 55%) on different days. In 7 subjects, mucus samples were collected 15 min after intravenous injection of 0.6 mg atropine. Viscoelasticity in these samples was 708 +/- 147 dyn/cm2, a value significantly different from Control 1 (p less than 0.05) and Control 2 (p less than 0.05) values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results show that such mice died of overwhelming lung disease at a median age of 24 months; in contrast, uninfected mice lived 4 to 6 months longer. Examination of infected mice over the period of 20 to 24 months of age provided evidence to suggest that recrudescence over this period of time was a general phenomenon within the infected mice, and was characterized by increases in lung bacterial numbers from approximately 10(4) to 10(8) organisms per animal. Experiments designed to investigate the underlying basis of this recrudescence revealed that the capacity of the old mice to mount acquired immunity to the infection exhibited a substantial age-related decline in these animals when compared with young mice exposed to similar aerogenic doses. The data suggest, therefore, that \"spontaneous\" recrudescence of pulmonary tuberculosis in old mice reflects their inability to recall anamnestic acquired immunity to the reemerging infection.\r"

Sixty-two patients were studied, all of whom received an intraocular infusion of approximately 200 to 300 mL of balanced salt solution with 0.5 mL of epinephrine 1:1000. There was no statistically significant change in blood pressure or heart rate during the time of epinephrine administration. Electrocardiogram monitoring during surgery showed no changes. We believe that dilute concentrations of epinephrine administered during extracapsular cataract extraction pose little threat of systemic toxicity.\r"

Twenty-three percent of eyes in the study group showed development of cataracts 29.9 months after laser treatment. This did not differ from the incidence of cataract formation (20%) in the same group before laser exposure (P = .357) and was significantly lower than the 49% incidence of cataracts observed in the age-matched control group (P less than .001). These data demonstrate the safety of laser iridotomy in the treatment of narrow-angle glaucoma.\r"

The clinical course, signs, symptoms, and corneal involvement of this disease, which sets it apart from other adenovirus conjunctivitis, are described. During the late summer of 1981, epidemics of viral conjunctivitis were reported in India and Miami, Florida. At this same time, in our office in Memphis Tennessee, we examined and treated 15 patients who had EKC of the adenovirus type 8 variety. A brief history, objective findings, and treatment of this condition are given along with findings, treatment, and follow-up of our series of patients; a probable cause of infection is offered. Good office hygiene can prevent the spread of EKC. Schiotz tonometry on a patient in the incubation period or during the later infection stage can spread the disease. Patients with EKC in whom a conjunctival pseudomembrane develops may have permanent scarring in the fornicies. Subepithelial corneal opacities of EKC may persist for months or longer, some more than three years. Use of topical steroids may cause remission of the subepithelial corneal opacities, but, when the drug is discontinued, reappearance of the lesions may result after months or a year or more.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy in 26 cases. Thirty-nine cases (43%) were familial, which is defined as more than one case in the family. Our interpretation of the pedigree data is that Alzheimer's disease is etiologically heterogeneous: it may be genetic or sporadic. In the familial type we think that the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant, with a wide range of age of onset within a family. In one-third of these families the gene is not expressed until over age 70. No clinical differences were found between the familial and the sporadic groups.\r"

A multiparametric analysis involving Alz-50 immunocytochemistry and azure B--RNA microdensitometry was developed to compare nucleic acid alterations in Alz-50-positive neurons to those in Alz-50-negative neurons of the brain of AD patients. Alz-50-immunoreactive neurons of the hippocampal endplate (Rose's H3-H5 fields) and the subiculum exhibited significantly lower (by approximately 30%) total RNA contents than negative neurons of the corresponding region. The mean RNA content of Alz-50-positive neurons of the AD brain was also reduced in comparison to that of Alz-50-negative neurons of age-matched, nondemented controls, whereas there were no significant differences between negative neurons of AD patients and controls. The hippocampus of nondemented controls was also found to contain Alz-50-immunoreactive neurons, although 20- to 30-fold fewer than the hippocampus of AD patients. In the controls, there was also a tendency toward reduced RNA levels in Alz-50-positive versus -negative neurons. These data suggest a relationship between Alz-50 immunoreactivity and defective nucleic acid metabolism in the AD brain.\r"

All 5 families are descendants of a group of immigrants known as the Volga Germans who came to the United States between 1870 and 1920. Their ancestors moved from Germany to the southern Volga region of Russia in the 1760s. All 5 American families are descendants of persons originally living in two small adjacent Volga German villages and share several surnames known to have been present in the census records of those villages. Although a single affected common ancestor cannot be identified, it is likely that the AD in these families represents an autosomal dominant gene inherited from one ancestor (the founder effect). This information is of importance in the genetic study of AD in these families because it greatly increases the probability of genetic homogeneity. There are more than 300,000 American descendants of the Volga Germans, and the prevalence of AD has never been studied in this population.\r"

Because of host range restrictions, experimental models of JCV-induced demyelination have not been available. The restricted tropism of JCV infectivity has recently been overcome by the production of transgenic mice that contain the early region of JCV in all cells. This portion of the DNA encodes JCV T-antigens. These mice display a dysmyelinating phenotype, the severity of which is related to the level of JCV early region expression in brain. With the use of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, we characterized morphologically myelin-specific and JCV gene expression in a severely affected strain of these mice. Our results suggest that expression of JCV T-antigens occurs predominantly in oligodendrocytes and is the primary cause of dysmyelination. Affected oligodendrocytes do not myelinate axons properly. However, they express myelin-specific genes and display some of the morphological phenotypes of early stages of myelination. A decreased ratio between levels of transcriptional and translational products of genes encoding the major structural proteins of central nervous system myelin was apparent. These results suggest that JCV T-antigens arrest the maturation of oligodendrocytes and inhibit the production of myelin. These results also demonstrate that JCV transgenic mice are a good model for investigating mechanisms of JCV-induced demyelinating lesions in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\r"

Six LAS patients had histories of symptoms suggesting mononeuropathy, 9 had symptoms suggesting distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, and 9 had histories of herpes zoster radiculitis. Overall, significantly more LAS patients (18) than controls (3) had histories of symptoms or signs of neurological abnormality (odds ratio, 10.0; p = 0.0003). By neuropsychological assessment, 9 of 18 LAS patients and 2 of 26 controls were abnormal (odds ratio, 12.0; p = 0.004). Of those abnormal on the neuropsychological assessment, the majority scored in the mildly impaired range. Magnetic resonance imaging was abnormal in 1 LAS patient and in 1 control. Neither neurological nor neuropsychological abnormalities correlated with duration of LAS, absolute T-helper lymphocyte count, or T-helper/T-suppressor lymphocyte ratio. These results indicate an association of neurological and neuropsychological abnormalities with HIV in patients with LAS. They suggest that mild neurological abnormalities in LAS are common and that HIV may directly or indirectly be the cause.\r"

Although the coexistence of parkinsonism and dystonia suggests a common pathophysiology, antiparkinsonian drugs did not consistently influence dystonic spasms. L-dopa-induced dystonia was seen as an off-period, biphasic, or peak-dose phenomenon. Each type showed a distinctive pattern of localization of dystonic spasms, possibly reflecting neurochemical aspects of basal ganglia somatotopy. Neuropharmacological studies performed in 12 patients suggest that off-period dystonia is genuinely induced by L-dopa and best relieved by antiparkinsonian agents.\r"

Radiotherapy results in at least transient stabilization of tumor growth in most patients but may also have adverse long-term effects, especially in young children. Since 1977, children with progressive CHG under 5 years of age at diagnosis have been treated with combination chemotherapy (actinomycin D and vincristine) without radiotherapy. Twenty-four patients, a median of 1.6 years of age at diagnosis, have been treated and followed for a median of 4.3 years (range, 0.3-10 years). All patients are alive. Nine have developed radiographic or clinical progression, occurring a median of 3 years (range, 2-6.5 years) after initiation of treatment. Fifteen of 24 (62.5%) have remained free of progressive disease and have received no other therapy. Tumor shrinkage was documented in 9 of 24 patients but did not clearly relate to long-term outcome. Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) obtained a median of 3.5 years after diagnosis in patients who received only chemotherapy was a mean of 103 (range 84-133). We conclude that chemotherapy can significantly delay the need for radiotherapy in children with CHG and such a delay may be beneficial regarding long-term outcome.\r"

Wounds were excised on days 3 through 7 and incubated in sodium bromide to allow separation of the epidermis and dermis. Specimens were considered healed if no defect was present. To promote optimal resurfacing in superficial wounds, polyurethane dressings need to be applied within two hours after wounding and should be kept in place for at least a 24-hour period.\r"

Even after withdrawal of testosterone therapy, this devastating type of acne still persisted for several months. After starting isotretinoin treatment, two cases progressed to full-blown acne fulminans with systemic manifestations. In these two cases, oral isotretinoin therapy induced multiple lesions of hyperproliferative granulation tissue resembling pyogenic granuloma. Topical steroid treatment proved to be beneficial for this adverse effect. Systemic corticosteroid treatment was administered in one case. High testosterone levels during puberty may be an important trigger mechanism of acne fulminans and may explain why this disease almost exclusively affects male adolescents.\r"

All children had prolonged hospitalizations. In two children, laboratory evaluation of immunologic function disclosed normal findings. We postulate that intense scratching of infected skin coupled with minor trauma to the fingertips created distal subungual microabscesses that spread contiguously to the underlying bone.\r"

The remaining five patients underwent exploratory laparotomy alone or with palliative bypass procedures. A 28% recurrence rate was observed, all of these after segmental resection, local excision, or endoscopic excision. The highest recurrence rate was associated with local excision. The 2- and 5-year survival rates for patients with adenomas containing invasive cancer were 22% and 0%, respectively, compared to 87% and 87%, respectively, for benign adenomas (including those with carcinoma in situ).

In 9 neonates (18%) and 4 infants (29%) enterocolitis was present at diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease, while 4 children acquired enterocolitis following a pull-through procedure. Significant risk factors for development of Hirschsprung's-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) were delay in diagnosis beyond 1 week of age and the presence of trisomy 21. HAEC did not occur more frequently in patients with long-segment aganglionosis, nor did an initial episode of HAEC confer a higher risk of recurrent enterocolitis. HAEC following a pull-through procedure was correlated with an anorectal stricture in three of four cases. Although neonates with HAEC had a low mortality rate (5%), their morbidity rate was 30% and their hospitalization was twice as long as neonates without enterocolitis.\r"

Fifty-eight colonic anastomoses were performed in dogs with this device; 23 stapled colonic anastomoses were also executed concurrently. Forty-four animals underwent a relaparotomy to remove the colonic specimen containing the anastomoses. Bursting pressure and the histologic features of the anastomoses were evaluated at different time intervals after operation. A good healing of all compression anastomoses was observed, thereby allowing them to initiate the experience in humans. Thirteen anastomoses (6 colorectal extraperitoneal, 1 colorectal intraperitoneal, 5 colocolonic, 1 ileorectal) were performed at the 1st Surgical Department, Milan University. One subclinical leakage (7.7%) spontaneously healed in a few days. No stenoses were observed.\r"

Seventeen patients (12 with malignant tumors and 5 with chronic pancreatitis) have undergone pancreaticogastrostomy following pancreatoduodenectomy. There was no operative mortality rate and no pancreaticogastrostomy leakage. Our data agree with data concerning pancreaticogastrostomy published in literature; cumulative mortality rate including our results is 4.5% (6 out of 134 patients) with only one transient benign pancreatic fistula reported. Many advantages offered by this method can explain these positive results including trypsine neutralization by gastric acidity and the possibility of nasogastric aspiration on contact with the anastomosis. Furthermore, permeability of the pancreatic duct can be easily verified by endoscopic examination. However, external pancreatic insufficiency does not seem to occur in long-term follow-up. These results suggest that this simple and safe method merits a more widespread application.\r"

We have treated 49 children with pancreatitis over the past 12 years ranging in age from 1 month to 18 years. One third of the patients had biliary tract disease as an etiology, with nearly half of these being related to underlying hematologic disease, usually sickle cell anemia. Another third of the pancreatitis was due to trauma, and one third of these were related to child abuse. Other etiologies were systemic disease (6 patients), congenital anomalies (8 patients), and idiopathic (3 cases). Eighty-two per cent of the patients presented with abdominal pain, but four children, all less than 4 years old, presented with an abdominal mass. Twenty-nine patients required 33 operations for pancreatitis. Fifteen of the 16 patients with biliary tract disease and all patients with congenital anomalies required operation. Six of the 16 patients with trauma required operation and none of those with systemic disease. As in adults ultrasonographic examination and CT scan are most important in the diagnosis; medical treatment consists of intravenous (I.V.) fluids, nasogastric suction, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and risk factors can help predict the severity of the disease while amylase alone is not related to severity. Different from adults, in children an etiology can usually be determined. The common etiologies, biliary tract disease, trauma, and congenital anomalies frequently require operation.\r"

Departments of surgery submitted and were awarded substantially fewer grants over the study period than departments of medicine. Additionally, the number of applications submitted from departments of medicine increased during this time period while those from departments of surgery declined. This record is particularly worrisome because it occurred during a period of time of unprecedented scientific and educational opportunities and support mechanisms provided by the NCI. Further conclusions and potential solutions are discussed in this paper.\r"

  ".U": "88149135\r", 
  ".W": "It is a long held belief that weight loss is a basic indicator of surgical risk. Many experienced surgeons, however, think otherwise. We have investigated the proposition that weight loss is a risk factor for postoperative complications but only when associated with clinically obvious physiologic impairment. Before major surgery, 102 patients had a careful history taken to ascertain if there had been recent weight loss and a reduction in the capacity for activity. Physical examination included assessment of mood, skeletal muscle function, respiratory muscle function, and wound healing. Plasma albumin was also measured. Using this information the patients were placed into one of three groups. Group I (N = 43) were normal, group II (N = 17) had weight loss greater than 10% but no clinical evidence of physiologic impairment, and group III (N = 42) had weight loss greater than 10% with clear evidence of dysfunction of two or more organ systems. The patients in group III had significantly more postoperative complications (p less than 0.05). They also had more septic complications (p less than 0.02) including a higher incidence of pneumonia (p less than 0.05) and a longer hospital stay (p less than 0.05) than patients in each of the other two groups. Objective measurements of body stores of protein and liver, and psychologic, respiratory, and skeletal muscle function, confirmed the validity of the clinical classification into the risk groups. The results demonstrate that weight loss is a basic indicator of surgical risk in modern practice providing it is associated with clinically obvious impairment of organ function. They suggest that adequate body protein stores are necessary for normal body function and for minimizing the risks of surgery.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade, selective criteria for elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms have been refined based on natural history and aneurysm expansion information. Using these criteria, contemporary preoperative preparation and newer intraoperative technical adjuncts, 123 consecutive patients underwent elective resection with 1 death (mortality rate: 0.8%). These include all patients operated on with both elective and urgent aneurysms at this institution since 1978, with the exception of those with frank rupture. Most importantly, however, the 5-year life-table survival of all of these patients (average age: 71.3 years, range 46-96 yr) was 72%, including both hospital and late mortality rates. More than half of the patients were over 70 years old (78 cases), with no hospital deaths and a 5-year life-table survival probability of 67%. For those under 70 years of age at the time of operation, the 5-year life-table probability of survival was 79%. We believe that these accomplishments were a direct result of an aggressive policy of screening for and selectively treating coronary disease and carotid stenosis preoperatively and the utilization of such intraoperative adjuncts as routine Swan-Ganz monitoring, autologous blood transfusion, the cell saver, and the frequent use of the tube grafting (50%). Thus, with proper selection, the outlook for the patient over 70 years old with an elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection now approaches that of the normal population (67% vs. 69%).\r"

Twenty-one patients (0.29%) developed an acute surgical abdomen in the period following cardiac surgery. The abdominal surgical complications were, in general, due to complications of peptic ulcer disease, decreased intestinal blood flow, and cholecystitis. There was no correlation between preoperative history, physical examination, cardiac function, laboratory data, and the subsequent development of an acute abdomen. Mortality rate, 24% after abdominal surgery, was increased with emergency cardiac operations, combined cardiac procedures, complications of cardiac surgery, unnecessary delay of abdominal surgery, and abdominal wound complications. Major abdominal wound complications were seen in 38%. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery may develop a variety of common abdominal surgical disorders. Patients so inclined cannot be identified prior to cardiac surgery. Ulcer prophylaxis, wound management, prompt resuscitation, and timely surgery are critical.\r"

We divided this region into 12 zones (six symmetrical zones on each side) using the above upper and lower limits and the costal margins, the midlines, and the anterior and posterior axillary lines. This study was conducted to determine the incidence of transdiaphragmatic penetration for the thoracoabdominal region stab wounds in each of the 12 zones identified for the first time and applied in this study, and the reliability and safety of surgical management based mainly on physical examination. The highest incidence of transdiaphragmatic penetration occurred in stab wounds of the left anterior lower thoracic zone (21.7%). The lowest incidence was 0% and the overall incidence was 11%. Physical examination was accurate in making the diagnosis in 95.4% of all cases and no mortality was associated with a delay in diagnosis that may have resulted from the serial physical examinations. We conclude that this method of selective operative management based on physical examinations is accurate and safe.\r"

The tumor was colonized in all patients, and the stomach, the esophagus, the duodenum, and the gastric mucosa were colonized in 96%, 87%, 83%, and 78% of the patients, respectively. The most common microorganisms isolated were streptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and Bacteroides species, belonging to the normal oropharyngeal flora. Microbial colonization with gram-negative rods, Clostridium species or yeasts, was present in at least one site in 91% of the patients. Clostridium species were isolated from 57% of the patients. The total numbers of microorganisms recovered from the tumor biopsies did not vary with the intraluminal gastric pH. A relation between the gastric pH and the total number of microorganisms in the gastric juice existed. Significant higher numbers of different strains of microorganisms (p less than 0.005) colonized the tumor compared to the gastric mucosa. Anaerobic microorganisms colonized the tumor significantly more often than the mucosa (p less than 0.001). Antibiotic agents used as prophylaxis in gastric cancer surgery should cover both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, including B. fragilis.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was performed of 118 surgically treated mammary recurrences, occurring following primary conservative excision and radiation therapy for clinical Stages I and II breast cancer. Actuarial cancer-specific survival following salvage surgery was 72% at 5 years and 58% at 10 years. With a median followup of 7 years, further local-regional recurrences were observed in 20 of the 118 patients, many of whom could be treated by further surgery. Actuarial survival after recurrence was significantly influenced by initial clinical stage, as well as by the disease-free interval following primary therapy, but was similar for both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients and for patients treated by radical or breast-conserving salvage operations. For recurrences after the fifth year, actuarial survival following salvage surgery was 83% and 68% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Survival for Stage I patients was favorable regardless of disease-free interval. It is concluded that recurrences in the breast following primary treatment with limited surgery and irradiation have a considerably more favorable prognosis than that of local failures after primary radical surgery. Suggestions for the management of these recurrences are presented.\r"

  ".W": "In modern teaching hospitals, patients typically receive direct care from a succession of different physicians, each of whom may order diagnostic tests on the same patient. We examined the association of test-ordering by multiple physicians with unnecessary duplication of 20-test chemistry profiles in 198 consecutively admitted patients. In a multivariate regression model, the number of duplicate chemistry profiles ordered for a patient was significantly correlated with the number of physicians ordering profiles after controlling for the overall intensity of profile testing. In a case-control analysis comparing duplicate with nonduplicate profiles, redundant tests were significantly more likely to have been ordered by a new physician who had not ordered a patient's previous profile than by the same physician who had ordered the previous chemistry panel. We conclude that test ordering by multiple physicians, the prevalent pattern in almost all teaching hospitals, predisposes to unnecessary laboratory examinations.\r"

In the laboratory, the within-run precision (coefficient of variation) of all methods ranged from 0.8% to 3.4%; the range for between-run precision was 1.2% to 3.3%. Correlation between the Abbott Vision analyzer and routine methods was excellent. The upper limit of linearity for all methods was as stated by the manufacturer. The coefficient of variation obtained by ten nontechnical personnel ranged from 0.0% to 3.9%. The correlation between results obtained by the nontechnologist were excellent. Our study indicates the Abbott Vision analyzer is extremely easy to operate and provides reliable results in the hands of nontechnical personnel.\r"

The initiation of this process remains an enigma. However, there appears to be three main features that are associated with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: pelvicalyceal obstruction, ulceration of the pelvicalyceal urothelium, and bacterial infection.\r"

Seven had both risk factors. Five had lobular cholestasis and four had acute or chronic hepatitis. One biopsy specimen showed changes of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. Another showed clear portal tract changes of large bile duct obstruction but no mechanical blockage of the biliary system; this suggests the thickened bile as postulated by Muirhead.

The cholesteryl ester accumulation in the acid lipase-deficient fibroblasts was demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively when cellular lipid extracts were subjected to thin-layer chromatography, followed by Nile red plate treatment and fluorescence spectrometry scanning. These results demonstrate the utility of the Nile red stain to document cellular lipid overloading. The techniques are simple to perform and can effectively supplement the standard enzymatic analysis used in the diagnosis of acid lipase deficiency.\r"

We report the rare occurrence of SHML in identical twins; to our knowledge, SHML in identical twins has been reported only once previously. The two patients described are also unusual because of the predominance of retroperitoneal disease with minimal peripheral adenopathy. After a seven-year clinical course, one twin died of extensive retroperitoneal disease, liver failure, bleeding diathesis, and seizure disorder. The other twin is alive after a six-year course of progressive retroperitoneal disease.\r"

Evaluation of the system has shown good to excellent reproducibility for clinical and photographic classifications. Comparisons of clinical and photograph-derived gradings has shown generally good agreement in classifying the presence and type of cataract; this agreement is highest for nuclear cataract. Photographic gradings of posterior subcapsular and, to a lesser degree, cortical opacities tend to underestimate the extent of opacification found by clinical gradings. The Lens Opacities Case-Control Study system is simple, reproducible, and easy to implement; it is offered for use in case-control and other cross-sectional studies of cataract with compatible classification goals.\r"

Seventy-seven of these subjects had a cataract in at least one lens. Antioxidant status was measured using erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and indexes that included these enzymes plus plasma levels of vitamin E, vitamin C, and carotenoids. Subjects were grouped by level (low, moderate, or high) of the enzymes and antioxidant indexes. Results suggest that subjects with high levels of at least two of the three vitamins (vitamin E, vitamin C, or carotenoids) are at reduced risk of cataract relative to subjects with low levels of one or more of these vitamins (odds ratio, 0.2). The erythrocyte enzymes, either individually or in combination, did not appear to differ between subjects with and without cataract.\r"

The administration of topical 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine solution before and after surgery markedly decreased the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier compared with vehicle-placebo solution administration at each time period, as measured by fluorophotometry. Corticosteroids were not given to any patients throughout the duration of the study. These fluorophotometric results correlated well with slit-lamp observations of postoperative ocular inflammation. Both ketorolac and vehicle were well tolerated by patients. No effects on intraocular pressure were seen with ketorolac administration. This study suggests that ketorolac ophthalmic solution is effective and safe as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for topical use following cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation.\r"

The ERGs were recorded as a function of the stimulus intensity and to a 30-Hz flickering stimulus. A Naka-Rushton-type function was fit to b-wave amplitudes, measured as a function of stimulus intensity, to evaluate changes in ERG amplitude and sensitivity. Compared with eyes in the no-NV group, eyes developing NVI had significantly reduced ERG sensitivity and amplitudes. The distributions of sensitivity values in these two groups did not overlap. All of the eyes with NV showed large a- and b-wave and 30-Hz implicit time delays, but only one eye had a b/a-wave amplitude ratio close to or less than 1. A comparison of ERG sensitivity, amplitude data, and flicker timing data with retinal fluorescein angiography in a two-alternative forced-choice analysis showed that ERG sensitivity and amplitude loss were better than retinal fluorescein angiography at discriminating eyes with CRVO and NVI from eyes with CRVO without NVI.\r"

Patients were followed up for six months to assess the correlation between initial ERG response and subsequent outcome. Seven patients developed rubeosis iridis. The b-wave implicit time was the parameter most significantly associated with subsequent rubeosis, followed by b-wave/a-wave amplitude ratio and then b-wave amplitude. Neither a-wave amplitude nor implicit time was a valuable predictor. The b-wave implicit times were equally predictive of rubeosis at each of the luminances used. In individually affected eyes, a b-wave implicit time at presentation, averaged across the range of luminances used, of greater than 47.17 ms was strongly associated with later rubeosis, as was an intereye difference of greater than 7.39 ms.\r"

There was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm tails at both the light and electron microscopic levels in patients with X-linked RP only. Thus, X-linked RP is associated with an alteration in sperm axoneme structure. Sperm cell analysis may serve as a useful model system for additional investigations into the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

Acinar cells of major and accessory lacrimal glands and, to a lesser degree, lacrimal duct epithelium showed degeneration and necrosis that were increased in extent in proportion to the radiation dose. Reduced numbers of serous acini and decreased size of remaining acini indicate that atrophy of lacrimal glands can be recognized within two days after irradiation.

A time-dependent decrease of the penetration was observed, and by nine hours after the administration, ciprofloxacin levels were 0.05 mg/L.

As early as five days after injection, proliferation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and retinal glial cells was observed in the subretinal space. These morphologically distinct proliferating cells were sometimes joined by junctional complexes. Morphologically, the proliferating RPE cells resembled either RPE cells or fibroblasts. Some proliferating RPE cells also retained their epithelial characteristics (ie, basement membranes and cell junctions), while others were partially dedifferentiated and showed some embryonic features. New formation of melanin could be identified within the proliferated RPE cells, which could account, in part, for the hyperpigmentation at the site of the bleb caused by the injection of vitreous. The results demonstrated that injection of autologous vitreous into the subretinal space can lead to subretinal proliferation of retinal glial and RPE cells in the rabbit.\r"

Since these patients also may have neutropenia and splenomegaly, their symptoms resemble those of patients diagnosed as having Felty's syndrome (FS). We studied the immunophenotypic and genotypic characteristics of mononuclear cells from patients with RA and neutropenia to better determine the extent of heterogeneity in this condition. Four patients had markedly increased numbers of LGLs, which expressed HNK-1 antigen and IgG Fc receptors. In contrast, the remaining 8 patients, who had FS, had normal LGL counts, and surface marker studies showed normal numbers of HNK-1 and IgG Fc receptor positive cells. Clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta chain gene was demonstrated in all 4 patients with excess LGLs, whereas a germline configuration of this gene was present in all 6 FS patients in whom this was studied. These results suggest that there are diverse groups among patients with RA and neutropenia. Since prognosis may differ, it is important to recognize that some patients who are considered to have Felty's syndrome may have a clonal proliferation of LGLs.\r"

That 2 of the most widely used indices of RA disease activity, radiographic erosion scores and joint count scores for tenderness, were independent of one another at a selected timepoint, should be considered in the design of clinical trials and long-term observation of patients with RA.\r"

Alternatively, a multivariate analytic approach, using discriminant functions, provides a useful single measure of the degree of neuropathy determined as a weighted combination of the available data. The weights are derived from the linear discriminant function, which maximizes statistical separation of diabetic and nondiabetic subject groups. In this study, 12 electrophysiologic attributes are used to generate a single discriminant function that clearly separates diabetic from nondiabetic subjects and is interpretable as a neuropathic index. Each individual's index of diabetic neuropathy (I) can be quantified as follows: (Formula: see text) where Ai is the original electrophysiologic attribute (i = 12), ai is the coefficient for each attribute that defines the discriminant function and C is a constant specific for that function. For the first time, the degree of diabetic neuropathy can thus be quantified for purposes of comparison and correlation with other quantifiable clinical/somatic measures of diabetes. The index allows for a higher percentage of type II diabetic patients to be classified as neuropathic than previously described and enables determination of degree of neuropathy is affected individuals by an interpolative method.\r"

The right extensor digitorum communis muscle was examined in 15 healthy volunteers with first a concentric and then a monopolar needle. The filter band-pass of the electromyograph was 20 Hz to 10 kHz. Four first-recruited MUAPs were isolated by using each electrode. A separate muscle insertion was performed to locate each potential. Amplitudes were maximized. Consecutive MUAPs were averaged and measured.

The role of the academic physiatrist in the future and the requirements for improving academic programs will be addressed. Like any other medical specialty, the viability of physical medicine and rehabilitation depends on its acceptance as an academic discipline. In recent years, there has been a number of positive indicators for strengthening academic physiatry including: increased educational exposure to medical students, increased number of residency programs and percentage filled and increased emphasis on research activities. Academic practice of physiatry should appeal to the individual with the following goals in life: (1) increase involvement in scholarly activities; (2) be on the cutting edge of new techniques and concepts of practice; (3) become a recognized expert in subspecialization areas; (4) vary practice more evenly between direct and indirect patient care activities; (5) work in an intellectually stimulating environment but with some constraint on one's destiny; (6) obtain adequate but not high financial rewards supplemented by a high benefit package; and (7) make a significant impact on the future of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the national level. Because academic physiatry will significantly influence the determination of what is rehabilitation and who will practice it, we must strive to improve the quantity and quality of academic programs. Areas especially needing attention are research and education to establish the scientific basis of the field and to train qualified personnel. To meet these goals, high quality clinical and scholarly programs with subspecialization, an adequate financial base and good marketing program will be necessary.\r"

Past treatment protocols have included proactive behavioral management and major tranquilizers. We now report the use of amitriptyline for control of agitation. For a period of over 2 years, 43 male and 15 female patients with a \"recent\" severe brain injury were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation and subjected to traditional structured programming for treatment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). In 20 patients, 18 men and 2 women, where agitation persisted sufficiently to impede rehabilitation despite initiation of structure, amitriptyline was instituted. These patients were of a comparable age (29.4 years for the agitated group versus 25.6 years for the nonagitated group), but the agitated patients had a lower median Rancho Los Amigos Hospital Level of Cognitive Functioning in a comparison to nonagitated patients (V versus VI). All patients were monitored for cognitive performance by the Orientation Group Monitoring System, and a daily account of frequency, severity and type of agitation was recorded. Within 7 days of initiation of therapy, 12 of 17 patients within PTA had dramatic decrease in agitation (5/5 patients at Rancho IV; 4/8 at Rancho V; 3/4 at Rancho VI). Two of the three patients at Rancho VII had agitation that was unresponsive to amitriptyline. The amitriptyline-responsive patients were maintained on the drug through PTA, and the Orientation Group Monitoring System scale demonstrated no impedance in cognitive recovery. Thus, amitriptyline appears most useful as an adjunct for treatment of nondirected agitation; it also has a role in reducing the severity of the directed agitation that is seen during but not after PTA.\r"

Without such an effort, people run the risk of moving apart rather than toward a closer working relationship. Regardless of whether an organization is a rehabilitation team, a university faculty or any other group in society, improvements in organizational functioning cannot be made without an awareness of conditions that create conflict.\r"

A secondary increase in GST concentration, at 24 h, was seen in a small number of individuals who received halothane or enflurane. Abnormal GST concentrations were found in 50% of patients following halothane anaesthesia, 20% following enflurane and 11% after isoflurane. The small but significant increases in GST concentrations in patients receiving halothane or enflurane suggests an impairment of hepatocellular integrity following the administration of these anaesthetics. In contrast, isoflurane anaesthesia did not appear to be associated with this effect.\r"

All three anaesthetics protected against both types of chemical convulsants; the degree of protection varied from 34 to 151%, with Althesin being the most effective. However, there was no correlation between their anti-convulsant and anaesthetic potencies, and no relationship between the effects on chemical convulsions and the interactions of the same agents with hyperbaric convulsions. These data suggest that the order of anti-convulsant potencies at equivalent anaesthetic concentration is Althesin much greater than ketamine = methohexitone, and that neither bicuculline-nor strychnine-induced seizures are a good model for hyperbaric convulsions.\r"

Forearm blood flow (FBF), hand blood flow (HBF) and systemic arterial pressure (AP) were measured before, and 9 and 18 min after the administration of hexamethonium. During the control period of halothane anaesthesia, HBF was AP-dependent, but FBF was not. Hexamethonium produced a statistically significant (P less than 0.001) decrease in systolic AP by 9 and 18 min, but significant reductions in FBF and HBF were seen only at 9 min. During the hypotensive period neither HBF nor FBF correlated with the systolic AP, which had decreased from an average of 98 mm Hg to an average of 65 mm Hg (range 95-50 mm Hg), but the changes in HBF and FBF did correlate with the changes in systolic AP. As a secondary factor, the control FBF correlated inversely with the reduction in FBF after hexamethonium. We concluded that hypotension induced by hexamethonium during halothane anaesthesia produced a transient reduction in limb blood flow that was dependent on the change in AP. A range of systolic AP from 95 to 50 mm Hg did not correlate with either FBF or HBF during the hypotensive period.\r"

All cats developed an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) (from 16 +/- 1.4 to 23 +/- 3.2 mm Hg) accompanied by a partial rebound in MAP. Eight additional cats received 0.1% trimetaphan to decrease their MAP from 128 +/- 13.4 to 52 +/- 8.1 mm Hg over more than 2 min. Four of these cats followed the same pattern, with ICP increases from 19 +/- 1.1 to 31 +/- 3.9 mm Hg, while in the other four ICP did not change. In nine of the 12 cats with an ICP increase, that increase was initiated before the partial MAP rebound. We conclude that trimetaphan causes clinically significant ICP increases in cats with increased ICP, that partial rebound in MAP frequently exacerbates these increases in ICP, and that rapid induction of hypotension tends to increase the frequency with which trimetaphan increases ICP.\r"

In group 2, AFP increased significantly to 15.8 +/- 18 mm Hg during laryngoscopy. This increase was significantly less than the group 1 response. Neither heart rate nor systolic arterial pressure changed significantly in either group during laryngoscopy--when compared with measurements in the quiet state.

In the elective group, plasma bupivacaine concentrations were significantly lower in the subgroup receiving extradural adrenaline than in the plain subgroup. This effect was not observed when comparing only those who received bupivacaine 100 mg. In the emergency group, there were no significant differences in plasma bupivacaine concentrations between the plain and adrenaline subgroups. Maximum plasma concentrations correlated significantly (P less than 0.0001) with dose of bupivacaine (mg kg-1).

The time to maximum cephalad spread and the upper level of analgesia increased with advancing age, whereas the time to onset of motor blockade decreased with advancing age. Effects of age on the total duration of analgesia and motor blockade could not be demonstrated. Age had no effect on the peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine. The time to peak concentration and the terminal half-life increased, whereas the total plasma clearance decreased with advancing age.\r"

The present study evaluates the possibility of such an interaction existing for the opioid partial agonist buprenorphine. Conscious rabbits (n = 6 in each group) pretreated 18-24 h previously with physiological saline or the MAO inhibitor phenelzine 20 mg kg-1 s.c. were subsequently given physiological saline, pethidine 5 mg kg-1 i.v. or buprenorphine 0.1 or 1.0 mg kg-1 i.v. Whilst saline was without effect and phenelzine produced only a small increase in the rabbit temperature, the combination of phenelzine and pethidine produced a marked, prolonged hyperpyrexia (+4.4 +/- 0.19 degrees C; P less than 0.001), hypertension (+33.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; P less than 0.01) and agitation. Three rabbits died, at 35, 45 and 55 min after the pethidine-phenelzine combination. Buprenorphine was without significant effect on any parameter when given after phenelzine. In the model used buprenorphine, in contrast to pethidine, showed no interaction with the MAO inhibitor phenelzine.\r"

Vecuronium 20 micrograms kg-1 was required for 50% twitch depression in both patients. The 90% blocking doses were 43 and 57 micrograms kg-1. Although these data do not indicate a greater than normal sensitivity to vecuronium, the recovery time (75-25% block) of twitch tension was three to almost six times as long as in normal children. The evoked compound EMG, additionally recorded in one patient, reflected almost the same dose-response relationship as twitch tension, yet the EMG recovered faster than the twitch. The present findings do not exclude an increased sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking drugs in a larger population of patients with muscular dystrophy. Thus, the titration of the individual neuromuscular blocking dose with the aid of a nerve stimulator is mandatory. During a previous anaesthetic, cardiac arrest and acute rhabdomyolysis had occurred in one patient. The substitution of suxamethonium by vecuronium, or probably any other non-depolarizing myoneural blocking drug of intermediate or short duration of action, may help to avoid this complication.\r"

  ".U": "88150179\r", 
  ".W": "The genetic variant prothrombin Salakta has been described in a patient presenting with a normal level of prothrombin antigen but reduced prothrombin activity. Initial studies indicated that factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages proceed normally but lead to the production of a thrombin molecule with an altered enzymatic activity. To characterize the functional abnormality of thrombin Salakta more precisely, it was purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex. The purified variant does not differ from normal thrombin by size, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and is 93.1% +/- 7.6% active by titration with p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate. Its activity, however, is altered to various extents toward the following substrates: H-D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine paranitroanilide (S 2238), fibrinogen, factor V, protein C, and antithrombin III. The Michaelis constant (Km) of thrombin Salakta for S 2238 is higher (12.2 +/- 3.3 mumol/L) than normal (2.8 +/- 0.7 mumol/L), whereas the turnover number (Kcat) is normal (84.4 +/- 6.6 s-1 v 85.9 +/- 14.0 s-1 for normal thrombin). The interaction of thrombin Salakta with benzamidine is also altered as evidenced by an increased inhibition constant (Ki = 3.5 mmol/L v 0.28 mmol/L for normal thrombin). The inability of fibrinogen to act as a competitor in the inactivation of thrombin Salakta by diisopropylfluorophosphate clearly indicates that fibrinogen binding to the fibrinopeptide groove is drastically impaired. In contrast, interactions involving sites remote from the active site such as those with fibrin and thrombomodulin are only slightly impaired. These results indicate that thrombin Salakta exhibits a specific pattern of functional alterations different from those reported for other variants. The structural defect seems to affect essentially the primary substrate binding site and to a lesser extent recognition site(s) remote from the catalytic site such as those for fibrin and thrombomodulin.\r"

However, the mechanism governing this chain of events is poorly known. In ECs glycoproteins immunologically and biochemically similar to the platelet membrane GpIIb-IIIa complex have been described. The functional role of this complex in ECs remains to be established. In this study we show that the antigens recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against human platelet GpIIb-IIIa and crossreacting with the EC form have a discrete and well-organized distribution at cell adhesion structures. Indeed these antigens are located at vinculin-rich focal contacts found at the membrane insertion of microfilament bundles of the stress fiber type. They are also found at cell-to-cell contacts and, with a diffuse pattern, at the dorsal surface of ECs. GpIIb-IIIa antibodies, added to EC suspensions prior to plating, inhibit EC spreading on fg and vitronectin (vn) substrata in a concentration-dependent way. In contrast, the antibodies are very poorly active when the cells are seeded on fn-coated glass. The same antibodies, added to adherent cells, disrupt cell-to-cell contacts and cause their rounding and detachment. Overall these results indicate that EC GpIIb-IIIa complex is involved in controlling the adhesion mechanism of these cells to extracellular matrix proteins.\r"

In the present study we eradicated peritoneal mast cells by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of distilled water. The regeneration process was investigated to clarify the relationship between L-CFU-Mast, M-CFU-Mast, and S-CFU-Mast. After injection of distilled water, M-CFU-Mast and S-CFU-Mast disappeared, but L-CFU-Mast increased, and then M-CFU-Mast and S-CFU-Mast appeared, suggesting the presence of a hierarchic relationship. When purified peritoneal mast cells were injected two days after the water injection, the L-CFU-Mast did not increase. In the peritoneal cavity of WBB6F1-+/+ mice that had been lethally irradiated and rescued by bone marrow cells of C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ (beige, Chediak-Higashi syndrome) mice, L-CFU-Mast were of bgJ/bgJ type, but M-CFU-Mast and S-CFU-Mast were of +/+ type. The injection of distilled water to the radiation chimeras resulted in the development of bgJ/bgJ-type M-CFU-Mast and then S-CFU-Mast. The presence of mast cells appeared to suppress the recruitment of L-CFU-Mast from the bloodstream and to inhibit the differentiation of L-CFU-Mast to M-CFU-Mast.\r"

Three patients with evidence of acute peripheral retinal arteriolar occlusion displayed a prompt reperfusion of the involved segment. Two other patients showed fading of retroequatorial red retinal lesions. Color vision performance was improved in six of the nine patients tested. The majority of patients also demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of blanching of the conjunctiva which reflects improved blood flow to this frequently involved area. Such improvements were not observable in a control group of untreated stable sickle cell subjects. These findings support the hypothesis that inappropriate vasoconstriction or frank vasospasm may be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the microvascular lesions of sickle cell disease and, further, that selective microvascular entrapment inhibition may offer an additional strategy to the management of this disorder. We believe a larger, placebo-controlled study with nifedipine and similar agents is warranted.\r"

  ".U": "88150187\r", 
  ".W": "Fibrinogen was isolated from the plasma of a 25-year-old female with a history of mild bleeding and several recent moderate to severe hemorrhagic episodes. Coagulability with thrombin approached 100% and varied directly with the time of incubation with the enzyme. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of thrombin-induced fibrinopeptide release demonstrated retarded fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fibrinopeptide B (FPB) release and the presence of an abnormal A peptide (FPA) amounting to 50% of the total. The same biochemical abnormalities were found in her asymptomatic father. Amino acid analysis and carboxypeptidase digestion of FPA demonstrated the substitution of His for Arg at A alpha 16. In contrast to the thrombin- and reptilase-sensitive Arg-Gly bond in the normal A alpha chain, the abnormal A alpha chain (A alpha) sequence is resistant to reptilase attack but is slowly cleaved by thrombin. To evaluate whether Birmingham A alpha and A alpha chains had been assembled nonselectively into heterodimeric (ie, 50% A alpha, A alpha) and homodimeric (ie, 25% A alpha, A alpha; 25% A alpha, A alpha) species, the clot and the clot liquor resulting from reptilase treatment of normal or Birmingham fibrinogen were separated, and each was then further incubated with thrombin to release remaining fibrinopeptides. Assuming that fibrinogen Birmingham contained heterodimeric molecules and that these and the normal molecules were completely incorporated into a reptilase clot, the expected coagulability would be 75%. In addition, subsequent thrombin treatment of the reptilase clot would release 50% of the total FPA and 75% of the total FPB present in the original sample. On the other hand, if only homodimeric fibrinogen species (50% A alpha, A alpha; 50% A alpha, A alpha) existed, the maximum reptilase coagulability would be 50%, and after thrombin treatment, 50% of the total FPB and no FPA would be recovered from the reptilase clot. We found the propositus's fibrinogen to be 68% coagulable, and we recovered 45% of the FPA and 70% of the FPB from the reptilase clot. Essentially the same coagulability and distribution of fibrinopeptides was found in the reptilase clot from her father's fibrinogen. We therefore conclude that fibrinogen Birmingham contains heterodimeric species (A alpha, A alpha) amounting to approximately 50% of the circulating fibrinogen molecules. The existence of heterodimers is consistent with a nonselective intracellular process of constituent chain assembly of dimeric plasma fibrinogen molecules.\r"

Lately a new heme compound, heme arginate, has been developed for the treatment of porphyrias. In experimental animal studies as well as in clinical use it has proved to be well tolerated. To find out whether heme arginate has any effects on hemostasis we have studied a number of parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis after a heme arginate infusion in seven healthy volunteers. All parameters studied remained practically unchanged except the coagulation factor X, which showed a transient, insignificant decrease during the maximal heme concentration. We believe that the lack of side effects is due to a better stability of heme arginate, the degradation rates being 1% for heme arginate and 61% for hematin in four hours. Our data favor the use of heme arginate in acute porphyrias as well as in other deficiency states of heme.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of platelets and the coagulation mechanism was studied by collecting blood from a standard bleeding time incision at 30-second intervals and measuring the plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), platelet factor 4 (PF4), and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). FPA was observed in the first samples (30 to 60 seconds) obtained, increased progressively until cessation of bleeding, and was markedly diminished after heparin administration, thus indicating that thrombin formation occurs early in incisional blood. PF4 increased monotonically throughout blood sampling, whereas the major increase in TxB2 appeared near the cessation of bleeding. The initial increase in FPA content occurred normally in patients with deficiencies of either factor IX or VIII, was markedly diminished in patients with factor X or V deficiency, and was delayed in patients with factor VII deficiency. These studies suggest that tissue factor activation of the classic (activation of factor X) extrinsic coagulation mechanism occurs as an early event during the arrest of bleeding from bleeding time incisions. The relation of the aforementioned to platelet activation is less clear because there was no consistent correlation between decreased FPA formation and impaired PF4 secretion or TxB2 production. In fact, the latter were normal in some subjects with the most impaired FPA formation, which suggests that both collagen and thrombin, perhaps synergistically, may contribute to platelet activation during the primary arrest of bleeding.\r"

This reduction in activity was associated with a significant decrease in the basal cytosolic calcium concentration and a diminished flux of calcium to the cytosol after activation. At all concentrations of FMLP tested, cytosolic calcium remained significantly lower in neutrophils from the old as compared with the young, whereas permeability to extracellular calcium and efflux of calcium from the cell were also significantly diminished. Pretreatment of the cell with the ionophore ionomycin elevated the cytosolic calcium concentration and significantly improved function in old neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that aging results in alterations in neutrophil calcium homeostasis that may play a role in the age-related decline in neutrophil function.\r"

It was of interest, therefore, to evaluate the effect of HCCHs on PMN orientation and chemotaxis and to determine their effectiveness as chemotaxins. Chemotaxis was evaluated using micro-Boyden chambers, f-actin was quantitated by nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-phallacidin fluorescence, and microtubules were quantitated by observing the concanavalin A (Con A) capping phenomenon. We also evaluated changes in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i using quin 2 fluorescence. We found that the HCCH isomers were not chemotaxins and that the HCCH isomers that stimulated O2- formation (delta and gamma HCCH) inhibited chemotaxis. This effect was associated with inhibition of orientation. In addition, we found extensive inhibition of both f-actin and Con A cap formation. These effects of HCCH on cell function were associated with marked increases of [Ca2+]i. This work suggests that non-receptor-mediated increases of [Ca2+]i associated with HCCH have divergent effects on cell function and suggests that physiologic responses of PMNs requiring cytoskeletal alterations, such as chemotaxis, depend on the controlled responses of receptor-mediated stimulation.\r"

One patient received platelet transfusions for counts less than 50 x 109)/L, one patient developed a clinical picture of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and six patients maintained a platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L at a median of 23 days (range 14 to 25 days) following stem cell infusion. This technique allows patients ineligible for autologous bone marrow transplantation due to unacceptable anesthetic risks, prior pelvic irradiation, or bone marrow metastases to receive marrow ablative therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The antithrombotic action of thrombomodulin was studied in mice. Rat and mouse thrombomodulin were isolated from lung acetone powders, and anti-rat thrombomodulin antibodies were prepared in rabbits. The antibodies neutralized both mouse (Kd approximately 150 nM) and rat thrombomodulin (Kd approximately 50 nM). A role for thrombomodulin in vivo was shown in mice injected intravenously (IV) with thrombin. All mice injected with 15 U thrombin (bolus) died of thromboembolism (mean survival 55 minutes), whereas those injected with a lower dosage survived. Prior injection with anti-rat thrombomodulin (1.8 mg IgG/mouse) potentiated the lethal effects of subsequent thrombin, whereas injection of thrombomodulin (isolated from mouse lung) prior to thrombin prolonged survival in a thrombomodulin concentration-dependent manner. The protective effect of thrombomodulin persisted for 30 minutes but after one hour thrombin injection was as toxic as in control animals. The half life (t1/2) for plasma clearance of 125I-mouse lung thrombomodulin was nine minutes. The major site of clearance was the liver, although thrombomodulin accumulated in several organs ten minutes after injection. The mechanism by which antithrombomodulin antibodies potentiated the lethal effects of thrombin was studied by measuring the protein C activating cofactor activity on vena cava removed from animals injected with antibodies. Protein C activation was inhibited by antibodies, suggesting a role for activated protein C in prevention of lethal thromboembolism. We found no effect of antibodies on the clearance of thrombin from mouse plasma, suggesting that blockade of endothelial endocytosis of thrombin does not play a significant role in the effects of antibodies. These results indicate that thrombomodulin participates in the defense against thrombosis in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with increased release of a plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitor. This response is dose dependent and parallels the LPS-induced expression of PBM tissue factor activity. The PA inhibitors of control and LPS-stimulated PBMs appear identical as both are identified by antibodies to PA inhibitor type 2 of human placenta, but not by antibodies to type 1 inhibitor of bovine aortic endothelial cells. The PA inhibitor is specific for urokinase type PA as determined by the 125I-fibrin plate assay, and direct cleavage of 125I-plasminogen; it does not effectively inhibit tissue-type PA. The inhibitor forms an active site-dependent complex with 125I-urokinase, which then demonstrates an increase in mol wt from 33 kd to 68 kd on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels. PBMs neither secrete nor express active PA. Hence, the exposure of PBMs to LPS results in conditions highly favorable to fibrin deposition and persistence: increased procoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities, accompanied by no measurable PA. Such modulation of these effectors may be important in the pathogenesis of fibrin characteristically found in tissue lesions of endotoxin-initiated processes.\r"

A total of 801 male patients over age 2 had G6PD electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes. Assays of both G6PD activity and hexokinase activity were then done on all samples that had an electrophoretic pattern other than the normal wild type (GdB). The collection of clinical data used a standardized protocol. Using cluster analyses we classified 10.4% males to be G6PD deficient, while 18.4% had the functionally normal GdA+ enzyme. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency did not change significantly when age was stratified by decade, suggesting little survival advantage or disadvantage of the combination of G6PD deficiency and HbSS. Compared to patients who were not G6PD deficient, there were no significant differences in the hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, or SGOT level in patients with HbSS who had G6PD deficiency. The incidence of painful episodes, sepsis, or acute anemic episodes was similar in both groups. Our results are consistent with recent studies of smaller numbers of patients that have found little influence of G6PD deficiency upon HbSS. Specifically, we found no evidence that G6PD enhanced the severity of hemolysis or increased the incidence of acute anemic episodes or sepsis in HbSS.\r"

  ".U": "88150212\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously described an English family with gamma delta beta-thalassemia in which a large deletion stops 25 kilobases (kb) upstream from the beta-globin gene locus, and yet the beta-globin gene is inactive in vivo. Affected family members had a beta-thalassemia minor phenotype with a normal hemoglobin A2 level. Gene mapping showed that these subjects were heterozygous for a chromosome bearing a large deletion that began in the G gamma-globin gene, extended through the epsilon-globin gene, and continued upstream for at least 75 kb. The A gamma-, delta-, and beta-globin gene loci on this chromosome were intact. To examine the possibility that an additional defect was present in the beta-globin gene, we cloned, sequenced, and examined the expression of the beta-globin gene from the affected chromosome. No mutation was found in the beta-globin gene sequence from 990 base-pairs 5' to the cap site to 350 basepairs 3' to the polyadenylation signal. The gene was subcloned into an expression vector and introduced into HeLa cells. Analysis of RNA derived from these cells, using a ribonuclease protection assay, revealed qualitatively and quantitatively normal transcription. Thus a structurally and functionally normal beta-globin gene is inactive in the presence of a large deletion more than 25 kb upstream. The loss of beta-globin gene function may be due to disturbance of chromatin conformation caused by the deletion or may be the result of loss of upstream sequences that are necessary for beta-globin gene expression in vivo.\r"

The hypodense cells (density less than 1.082) contained significantly less MBP than normodense (density greater than 1.082) eosinophils (P less than .001) as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Electron microscopic examination demonstrated a mean of 25.0 +/- 4.4 (X +/- 1 SD) granules per hypodense cell, compared to 30.6 +/- 8.4 granules per cell in the normodense group (P less than .1). The most striking difference between the hypodense and normodense eosinophils was the small individual granule size (X = .14 +/- .05 v .26 +/- .05 micron 2, respectively, P less than .001), and the smaller total granule area (3.2 +/- 1.8 vs 7.7 +/- 3.1 micron 2, respectively, P less than .001). Because the cytoplasmic areas were similar in the two groups, the mean percent area of cytoplasm occupied by granules was significantly lower in the hypodense group (P less than .001). The finding of consistently smaller granules in the presence of equal or fewer granules per cell in the hypodense eosinophils may explain the lower MBP content and thus provide a morphologic basis for the low density of eosinophils in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome.\r"

When C3b was bound by antibodies to antigens on branched-chain glycoproteins, cleavage to C3dg occurred more rapidly than when C3b was bound by antibodies to antigens closer to the red cell lipid bilayer. The rate of cleavage to C3dg also correlated directly with the number of complement receptors (CR1) per red cell, reflecting their role as cofactors in the cleavage of iC3b by factor I. Thus, the life span of C3b/iC3b on human red cells, which may be important for determining the rate and mechanism of clearance of C3-coated red cells, appears to depend on the CR1 status of the red cells and the characteristics of the antigen sites around which complement is bound.\r"

We now present the nucleotide sequence of a G gamma-globin gene from an American black with G gamma-beta + HPFH. The immediate 5'-flanking region of this G gamma gene has a T-to-C change at -175, C at -158, and a normal C at -202. Additional changes were found in IVS2 and in the immediate 3'-flanking region, some of which may represent gene-conversion events. The sequence change at -175 probably represents a second mutation associated with the G gamma-beta + HPFH phenotype in blacks. This base change alters an octamer sequence known to be of importance in the normal expression of several other genes.\r"

To obtain populations of cells in which a high proportion of cells were expressing the neo gene, several important modifications were made to earlier procedures. Cells from normal donors were infected in vitro, were exposed to high concentrations of G418 for two days in liquid culture to enrich for cells expressing the neo gene, and were plated in semisolid medium. Gene transfer and expression were detected in colonies arising from progenitors of granulocyte-macrophage and erythroid lineages. Survival curves indicated that a high proportion of progenitor cells, approaching 100%, were G418 resistant. Furthermore, addition of growth factors contained in 5637-conditioned medium to the bone marrow improved the recovery of G418-resistant progenitors twofold to threefold. In addition to these biological measurements of gene expression in progenitor cells, significant levels of neo-specific RNA, similar to the levels of RNA expression in the virus-producing fibroblast cell line, were detected in the bone marrow cells after preselection. These results demonstrate that retrovirus vectors can be used successfully to transfer genes at high efficiency into progenitor cells in the human blood-forming system.\r"

The prevalence of HBsAg in families with clusters and solitary cases of HCC was compared. The clustering of HCC in the five families reported could not be accounted for by a higher HBsAg carrier rate or an earlier age of onset of the hepatitis B virus infection.

Five patients with isolated pelvic recurrences received CDDP therapy only. The chemotherapy pump was refilled weekly on an outpatient basis. All nine evaluable patients developed unilateral or bilateral lower extremity pain which responded to dosage reduction. No renal or marrow toxicity was seen. Both of the evaluable patients treated for recurrent tumor died 32 and 60 weeks after initiation of treatment. The seven patients treated primarily with RT + CDDP infusion include one who expired with persistent tumor and one with no evidence of disease (NED) after exenteration for a pelvic recurrence at 48 and 85 weeks respectively. The five remaining patients are NED at 12 to 60 weeks. Constant internal iliac artery infusion of CDDP via an implantable chemotherapy pump can be performed with acceptable toxicity. The preliminary results suggest that further study in previously untreated undergoing concurrent radiotherapy is warranted.\r"

Competitive binding studies showed that 4-hydroxytamoxifen effectively binds to cytoplasmic estrogen receptors (ER) in uterine adenocarcinomas. Of 20 endometrial adenocarcinomas examined, five tumors were successfully grown in primary cell culture. The addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (1 nmol/l to 1 mumol/l) in a medium supplemented with estrogen-free serum resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of cancer cells in two tumors having ER. However, 4-hydroxytamoxifen did not affect the growth in the culture system of the remaining three tumors, in which ER were absent in two tumors but were present in one. These results strongly suggest that tamoxifen has a direct growth-inhibitory effect on human endometrial adenocarcinoma possibly through ER in the tumor.\r"

Tamoxifen did not induce significant changes in these parameters to account for the reported thromboembolic events associated with this therapy. The reduced antithrombin III activity previously described in patients receiving tamoxifen for metastatic breast cancer may reflect disease activity rather than a direct effect of tamoxifen on blood coagulation.\r"

The present study has examined the biochemical and morphological effects of in situ isolated lung perfusion in dogs with doxorubicin (DOX). A dose related complication was seen in the animals following lung perfusion. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the perfusate increased as dose was increased, indicating tissue damage during the perfusion. Up to 7 days postperfusion, marked changes were seen in the serum protein concentrations although these were independent of doxorubicin concentrations. Serum lactate dehydrogenase showed a dose dependent increase 2 hour and 1 day after the lung perfusion. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activities up to 14 days postperfusion suggested that DOX produced pulmonary endothelial cell injury at higher drug doses. Histopathologic examination of the lungs from dogs receiving the highest concentrations of drug indicated that necrosis of arterial endothelia and alveolar epithelia accompanied by periarterial edema, subplural edema and emphysema of the lungs were the probable causes of acute animal mortality. The study has demonstrated that doxorubicin produces dose-dependent damage to the pulmonary tissue. However, the observed injury only appeared life-threatening at perfusate drug concentrations in excess of 20 nmol/ml. In situ lung perfusion for the treatment of unresectable pulmonary tumors may be clinically applicable.\r"

Radiotherapy was used as the first line of management in this series and surgery was reserved for failures even though very few patients opted for salvage surgery. Of the 234 evaluable patients, 42% survived disease-free at the end of 3 years with radiotherapy alone. Eighty-five percent of the patients with Stage I, 63% with Stage II, 41% with Stage III, and 15% with Stage IV disease survived disease-free at 3 years. With radium implant and small-volume beam-directed external radiotherapy, the survival rates were similar (62% versus 64%). The results of external radiation in advanced disease were dismal. Persistent disease after radiotherapy was a serious problem in advanced stages, especially in view of nonacceptance of salvage surgery by a significant proportion of patients. The most effective way of improving cure rates in cancer of the buccal mucosa seems to be early detection.\r"

Thirteen patients had carcinomas and three had sarcomas. All patients had complete pelvic surgery including extrafascial (or modified radical) hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic node sampling, evaluation of peritoneal cytology, and resection of extrauterine metastases when indicated. All patients were free of gross visible tumor after surgery. Target doses of radiation were 3000 cGy to the upper abdomen and 4500 cGy to the pelvis. Median follow-up was 24 months for survivors (range, 17 to 63 months). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 17 months was 50%. Six of the 16 (38%) patients suffered intraabdominal relapse. One patient had a significant complication (bowel perforation). The data from this pilot study suggest that whole abdominal-pelvic irradiation may be useful only in the management of some patients with few high risk features of endometrial carcinoma. Patients with extensive extra-uterine involvement and with sarcoma histology do not appear to benefit from this experimental therapy.\r"

The injection of up to 12 times (on a liver weight basis) the anticipated human dose of nonradioactive TheraSphere into the hepatic arteries of dogs was well tolerated and produced clinically silent alterations within centrolobular areas. The hepatic arterial (HA) injection of radioactive TheraSphere also produced portal changes similar to those observed in humans after external beam therapy. While the extent of damage increased with the delivered dose, radiation exposures in excess of 30,000 cGy did not cause total hepatic necrosis and were compatible with survival. No microspheres distributed to the bone marrow and absolutely no myelosuppression was encountered in any animal. Proposed hepatic exposures to humans of 5000 to 10,000 cGy by means of these microspheres, therefore, would appear to be feasible and tolerable. Radiotherapeutic microsphere administration preceded by regional infusion of a radiosensitizing agent and/or immediately following the redistribution of blood flow toward intrahepatic tumor by vasoactive agents can potentially yield a synergistic, highly selective attack on tumors confined to the liver.\r"

Surgically removed breast tumors were assayed for the progesterone receptor by the dextran-coated charcoal method. The PR values (fmol/mg DNA) (mean +/- standard error [SE]) of PR-positive tumors in the control, TAM-3, TAM-7, and TAM-14 day groups were 571 +/- 176, 1699 +/- 408 (P less than 0.01), 1675 +/- 463 (P less than 0.05), and 686 +/- 191, respectively. There was a 4.6-fold increase in the mean PR value in postmenopausal patients and a two-fold increase in premenopausal patients after TAM treatment for 3 and 7 days. We concluded that PR induction provoked by TAM reached a peak on day 3, continuing at this level until day 7. A longer treatment (14 days) with TAM appears to abolish the PR inducing activity, probably because of, first, estrogenic and, later, the antiestrogenic effects of TAM.\r"

Gut endocrine cells have variously been considered of neural crest or endodermal origin, but conclusive evidence, particularly in humans, is lacking. It has been shown that in mouse gastrointestinal tract, a single progenitor cell gives rise to both columnar and mucous cells, but it has yet to be demonstrated that such a progenitor cell can also give rise to endocrine cells. Here, a single human rectal adenocarcinoma cell has been shown to differentiate into columnar, mucous and endocrine cells; therefore all epithelial lineages are of clonal origin. Additionally, these results show that human colorectal enteroendocrine cells, at least in neoplastic epithelium, have an endodermal origin.\r"

The immunologic phenotype was determined in 14 of these cases. One was of T-cell lineage, and the others exhibited B-lymphoid markers. Sixty-eight percent of the patients presented with extranodal localizations. In the clinical follow-up a complete remission was observed in 78% of patients with a mean duration of 37 months (range, 5 to 120 months). The actuarial survival after 5 years was 45%. From these data we conclude that multilobated NHL are comparable to diffuse, large cleaved-cell NHL of an intermediate grade malignancy according to the Working Formulation or are comparable to the diffuse centrocytic-centroblastic NHL according to the Kiel classification. The neoplastic cells are to be considered as variants of follicle center cells, but the clinicopathologic correlation indicates that multilobated NHL represent a distinct nosologic entity.\r"

Twenty patients (87%) had intestinal type tumors and only two (9%) had papillary tumors. Associated adenomata were present in eight cases (35%) and distant ductular dysplasia was present in nine cases (39%). Long-term survival was correlated independently with tumor grade (P = 0.0031) and a new staging system that assesses local invasiveness (P = 0.0055). No correlation was found between survival and sex, tumor size, or presence of adenoma. Age was significant in univariate analysis (P = 0.0322) but not in multivariate analysis. A simple scoring system based on the grade and stage increased the predictability of survival (P = 0.0004). Application of this scoring system may allow an objective comparison of long-term survival results after resection from different series.\r"

When the intramural and extramural types of BVI were combined, no significant impact was noted on the patterns of failure or survival in patients with BVI+ versus those with BVI- tumors. In contrast, the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion was found to significantly decrease survival. By using a proportional hazards analysis, it was found that BVI was not an independent prognostic variable. Therefore, the use of BVI alone is not recommended for selecting patients with rectosigmoid and rectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant therapy.\r"

Cancer cells were equally stained with fluorescent R 1881 and mibolerone, and this fluorescence seems to be made up of both the androgen receptor and progestin-binding protein. The staining with fluorescent DHT was weak. Sixty-two Stage D2 prostatic cancer patients were examined with histochemical androphilic protein, and they then received endocrine therapy. The presence of fluorescence of R 1881 was not correlated with grade, but a relationship between the presence of fluorescence and the response to endocrine therapy was noticed 6 months after the start of treatment. Moreover, fluorescence-positive patients showed better survival than fluorescence-negative patients. An examination with fluorescent DHT revealed a similar tendency to that of R 1881, but the frequency of positive fluorescence was lower, indicating that R 1881 is a suitable ligand in this type of study.\r"

  ".W": "This study of compliance was performed to determine whether a medically indigent population with breast carcinoma that has been neglected is an appropriate group for inclusion in an aggressive combined treatment program. After incisional biopsy, 28 locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients received two cycles of cytoxan, Adriamycin, 5-Fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (CAFT) followed by a simple mastectomy and level I axillary dissection. After surgery, patients received four additional cycles of CAFT alternating with three cycles of 15 Gy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. Compliance was defined as overall compliance, the percentage of patients completing the protocol as described; and appointment compliance, the ratio between treatments or appointments attended versus those scheduled. Overall compliance was 75% (21 of 28 patients). The total number of appointments scheduled was 1054 (mean, 37 +/- 2), and the total attended was 965 (mean, 34 +/- 3), giving an appointment compliance rate of 91.7%. Compliance did not vary significantly with age, marital status, nationality, the presence of complications, or delay to diagnosis. Compliance did decrease significantly with time. There was 100% overall compliance at 2 months, 82% at 6 months, and 75% at 1 year. We conclude that although our patients had neglected their disease and were medically indigent, they were highly motivated patients once in therapy. This suggests that complex treatment regimens are feasible as well as effective for the treatment of LABC.\r"

The authors report on five patients with residual carcinoma after radiotherapy. Three patients had undergone external-beam radiotherapy and two had undergone interstitial plus external-beam radiotherapy. All salvage radical prostatectomies were uncomplicated technically. One patient had a myocardial infarction believed to be unrelated to the procedure. Two patients, observed for over 1 year, have mild residual stress incontinence but residual adenocarcinoma proved to be localized to the surgical specimen in all but one patient. One patient underwent nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and has had return of sexual function. Salvage radical prostatectomy is a viable option for patients who have histologically proven residual carcinoma after definitive radiotherapy.\r"

Almost all adenomas were less than 5 mm in diameter, although 6.7% of the ones seen predominantly in the rectosigmoid colon were larger than 1 cm. The prevalence and number of adenomas increases with age. The prevalence of hyperplastic polyps was very low (1.6%). The data shows a relationship between the prevalence of colon adenomas in Spain and the incidence of colon cancer. The prevalence of colon adenomas in Spain is one of the lowest compared with that in other European countries and North America.\r"

On an irritation log ranking scaled 0 to 5, placebo gels produced virtually no irritation, except those formulated at pH 1, 2, and 14. Albuterol, furosemide, and methyldopa produced essentially no irritation. Minutes of exposure to sodium indomethacin, sodium naproxen, and propranolol (at, respectively, pH 8.2, 9.6, and 4.8 and concentrations of 12%, 40%, and 8%) caused ulceration that took up to weeks to heal. Acid forms of naproxen and indomethacin caused minimal or no irritation. Although irritation models based on one gastrointestinal area have limitations, our results indicate that the minimally invasive buccal assay allows ranking of contact irritation potential of drugs and formulations that could aid in selecting optimum formulations for clinical use.\r"

The elimination half-life of M-1 was prolonged significantly in subjects with MRF and that of M-3 was also prolonged in subjects with SRF or MRF. The peak plasma drug concentration, time to reach peak concentration (tmax), and AUC were significantly larger in subjects with SRF and MRF than in normal subjects, except for Tmax in subjects with SRF. In M-2 and unchanged delapril, no difference was observed. The 24-hour cumulative urinary excretion of those metabolites was significantly lower in subjects with MRF than in normal subjects. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, suppressed at 4 hours in all subjects, remained significantly low in patients with MRF at 24 hours. Blood pressure was reduced more in subjects with chronic renal failure. It was concluded that delapril is excreted mainly through the kidney and its pharmacodynamics and biologic effects are affected by the renal dysfunction.\r"

Ten burned patients and 10 age-, weight-, and sex-matched control subjects were studied after a 2 mg bolus dose of lorazepam. Burned patients had received multiple medications, whereas control patients were not taking any medication. The burned patients were studied at a mean (+/- SE) of 22 (+/- 4.6) days after burn injury. The burned patients had increases in total volume of distribution (2.66 +/- 0.55 vs. 1.39 +/- 0.1 L/kg; P less than 0.02) and clearance (4.28 +/- 1.20 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.1 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.01), whereas the half-life was significantly reduced in the burned group (9.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 13.9 +/- 0.9 hours; P less than 0.025).

HNMT activity was measured in RBC lysates from 241 members of 51 nuclear families. After correction for the gender-specific effects of age, the frequency distribution of RBC HNMT activities was unimodal, and activities varied threefold within 2 SDs of the mean. The correlation of HNMT activities in RBCs from 45 pairs of spouses was only 0.070, indicating that shared environment did not result in similar activities among genetically unrelated individuals. Correlation coefficients were also calculated for pairs of genetically related individuals. All of these correlations were significant except the mother-oldest son correlation. The majority of the correlations did not differ significantly from those predicted for a trait with a heritability of 1.0 (100%). Our results demonstrate a significant familial aggregation of human RBC HNMT activity and suggest that inheritance may play an important role in the regulation of variation in the activity of this N-methyltransferase enzyme in the human RBC.\r"

In only one patient was midazolam serum elimination half-life less than 2 hours and in six patients the half-life was greater than 10 hours. A wide range of midazolam serum levels was associated with adequate sedation, and similarly the midazolam levels at the moment of awakening were highly variable. The serum concentration ratio of midazolam/alpha-hydroxymidazolamglucuronide at the end of the infusion varied from 0.03 to 15.6. Renal function could account for only a part of this variation.\r"

Each treatment consisted of a 2-minute bolus injection followed by an 8-hour infusion. Treatment A, placebo, consisted of a 50% propylene glycol injection followed by a saline infusion.

For both DSS and SE data, three distinct effect-concentration curves result from the three alprazolam treatments, with successive shifts to the right as dose increases. A tolerance rate constant (kt) of 0.15 hr-1 was calculated from the DSS vs. time data during the 8 hour alprazolam infusion. The Hill equation was altered by using kt in an exponential modification of EC50. The resulting tolerance model describes both DSS and SE vs. concentration data from the rapid-injection and continuous-infusion treatments.\r"

Hemodynamic responses to epinephrine were not significantly different between the two groups.

Epinephrine ischemic thresholds ranged from 652 to 3362 pg/ml. Patients with CAD compared with normal subjects had more frequent ventricular arrhythmias (55% vs. 25%), chest pain (50% vs. 13%), and ischemic ECG changes (73% vs. 13%).

The pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the healthy volunteers were similar to those reported previously. Maximum plasma concentration, time of maximum concentration, and apparent volume of distribution after single doses in patients with renal impairment were in the same range as those observed in healthy volunteers. The elimination half-life increased with decreasing renal function from a mean value of approximately 8 hours in healthy volunteers to more than 20 hours in patients with moderate renal impairment. Renal clearance and the fraction of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine decreased with decreasing creatinine clearance. The results of this study suggest that the dosage of cibenzoline should be reduced or the dosage interval increased in patients with reduced renal function to avoid excessive drug accumulation.\r"

After all nisoldipine treatments a significant decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (mean 10% to 16%) and increase in heart rate (mean 22% to 44%) were observed. Hemodynamic effects until 2 hours after nisoldipine administration could be fitted to a sigmoidal Emax model. At times after 2 hours a second effect peak was observed. Cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of nisoldipine but has no significant influence on hemodynamic parameters.\r"

  ".W": "1. Beginning with a single propositus, who had been previously diagnosed at the age of 10 as suffering from trimethylaminuria (fish-odour syndrome), both her parents and two sisters were investigated biochemically with respect to their ability to N-oxidize trimethylamine (TMA), both when derived from the diet and when administered exogenously. 2. Both the propositus and a second sister were markedly deficient in their ability to N-oxidize TMA, both when derived from the diet and when given as such; furthermore, both siblings readily developed the symptoms of fish-odour syndrome as characterized by a strong objectionable breath and body odour shortly after the oral administration of TMA (300 mg). 3. At this dose level of TMA, neither of the parents nor the third sister showed any evidence of impaired N-oxidation ability nor did they experience any 'fish-odour' symptoms. 4. With an oral challenge of 600 mg of TMA, both the parents showed a clear impairment of N-oxidation capacity which was not seen in six healthy unrelated volunteers. Both parents experienced a fish-odour syndrome at this level of TMA challenge. 5. The family data support the hypothesis that trimethylaminuria is an inborn error in the ability to N-oxidize TMA which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Furthermore, experience with this family suggests that an oral challenge dose with 600 mg of TMA may be used to identify carriers of the condition.\r"

Quadriceps protein synthetic rates in normal subjects were (mean +/- SD) 0.046 +/- 0.012 and 0.075 +/- 0.014%/h in the post-absorptive and fed states respectively. These results are significantly lower than we previously reported (M. J. Rennie et al., Clinical Science, 1982, 63, 519-523 [1]) but show the same relative differences of direction and magnitude, confirming the effects of feeding previously reported. In patients with muscular dystrophy, muscle protein synthetic rate was, as previously reported [1], much lower in the fed state than in normal subjects. A new finding is that for patients with myotonic dystrophy the rate is also depressed in the post-absorptive state. 3. We suggest that the present estimates in post-absorptive and fed normal subjects be used as reference values for quadriceps mixed muscle protein synthetic rate.\r"

We have therefore developed a simple and rapid needle biopsy procedure for the determination of the concentrations of K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Na+, K+-pumps in muscle. 2. Using a Bergstrom needle, biopsies weighing around 25 mg were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of 18 normal subjects (aged 44-86 years) and extracted with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The concentrations of K+, Na+ and Mg2+ were 90.7 +/- 1.8, 31.9 +/- 1.6 and 9.5 +/- 0.2 mumol/g wet wt., respectively (means +/- SE). 3. The TCA extraction gave the same values as digestion with 65% HNO3 or 35% H2O2, could be used over the weight range 10-55 mg and showed a Mg2+ recovery of 101.7%. 4. The concentration of Na+, K+-pumps was quantified as the total capacity for [3H]ouabain binding. In vastus lateralis biopsies obtained from six normal subjects the mean value was 258 +/- 16 pmol/g wet wt. 5. Comparison of the concentrations of K+, Mg2+ and [3H]ouabain-binding sites in samples obtained post mortem showed modest variation among different muscles with varying fibre composition. 6. Measurements of the concentrations of K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Na+, K+-pumps in duplicate biopsies of the vastus lateralis yield values which seen representative for the total pool of skeletal muscle fibres and can be performed within a few hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined whether the severity of acute renal failure seen within 4 h of a 45 min period of unilateral occlusion of the renal pedicle could be reduced by removal of the contralateral healthy kidney and/or intrarenal flush with a phosphate-buffered sucrose (PBS50) solution. 2. After ischaemia, unflushed kidneys became oliguric and isosthenuric, with a fall in inulin clearance (Cin) to 0.1% of the pre-ischaemic value. Removal of the healthy contralateral kidney upon release of the occlusion caused no improvement in immediate post-ischaemic function. 3. Intrarenal flush with 1.5 ml of PBS50 resulted in a significantly improved post-ischaemic Cin, with increased urine flow rate and solute excretion; urine was also concentrated. 4. Protection of renal function against ischaemic damage was seen only when kidney tissue remained blood-free and exposed to PBS50 throughout the period of ischaemia, and when the speed of flush was similar to the expected renal blood flow (6 ml/min). Protection did not depend upon the presence or absence of the contralateral kidney. 5. The study also showed that functional removal of one kidney, either by pedicle occlusion or nephrectomy, caused an immediate rise in solution excretion from the contralateral kidney, but Cin remained unchanged. Unflushed severely damaged kidneys showed no compensatory response to unilateral nephrectomy, whereas kidneys flushed with PBS50 exhibited increases in solute excretion similar to those seen in healthy non-ischaemic kidneys.\r"

Reperfusion NA overflow, after 40 min of ischaemia, is suppressed by desipramine and increased when ischaemia follows a period of substrate deprivation. 3. Reperfusion after 40 min of ischaemia is associated with a significant rise in NA concentration despite a simultaneous 20-fold increase in flow. This increase in concentration is abolished by treatment with desipramine or if ischaemia follows a period of substrate deprivation. 4. Reperfusion NA overflow correlates with the reperfusion overflow of an extracellular space marker infused before the ischaemic episode. 5. These results suggest that ischaemia is heterogeneous and that NA is released into regions of particularly profound ischaemia from which it is subsequently eluted during reperfusion.\r"

The adequacy of airway anaesthesia induced by bupivacaine aerosol was confirmed by the absence of the cough reflex to 5% citric acid aerosol on completion of exercise. 3. All subjects first performed a trial exercise test to familiarize them with the procedure and to assess the degree of arterial oxygen desaturation on exercise. In subsequent tests, supplementary oxygen was given to maintain the saturation at 95% or above. 4. Airway anaesthesia had no effect on the ability to perform exercise as assessed by maximum workload, CO2 production or heart rate. No significant changes were seen on the pattern of breathing, minute ventilation or end-tidal PCO2 on exercise. There was, however, a small but statistically significant increase in ventilation related to CO2 production (VE/VCO2) at the end of exercise. 5. There was a tendency for breathlessness to be increased by airway anaesthesia but this did not reach statistical significance. 6. These results provide no evidence that vagal afferent activity is responsible for the abnormal ventilatory response to exercise in patients with interstitial lung disease. The perception of breathlessness in these patients was not diminished by anaesthesia of the airway.\r"

There was an immediate increase in absorption 1 day after refeeding, which preceded a slower increase in CCPR. The absorption rate then decreased progressively after refeeding, and was significantly lower than control levels 1 week after refeeding. The CCPR, however, increased more gradually, reaching control levels after 2 days and then 'overshooting' control values. 4. There was no significant change in the crypt cell population immediately after refeeding; thus we propose that the initial increase in absorption on refeeding is either due to an accelerated maturation rate of the enterocytes or to the migration of enterocytes from the base of the villus to the functional zone. 5. The rapid recruitment of absorptive function appeared to be a 'one-off' event, the villus compartment then having to wait for increased cell production in the crypts to repopulate the villi.\r"

Most of the data available on these alterations come from resting subjects; the response to acute stress may provide additional insights into the age effect on these responses. 2. We measured supine and 10 min upright plasma noradrenaline and lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity in ten healthy elderly subjects (age 66-80 years) and seven healthy young subjects (age 27-34 years). 3. Isoprenaline stimulation of lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity was not significantly different between supine and upright positions or between elderly and young subjects. There was a marked increase in forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the upright posture in both elderly and young subjects. The increment over supine levels was 70% in the elderly (P less than 0.025) and 73% in the young (P less than 0.05). This enhanced forskolin activity was not seen in two young subjects who became syncopal. 4. These data suggest that enhanced forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity occurs after 10 min of upright posture in both elderly and young subjects, and may be relevant to immediate blood pressure regulation. We were unable to demonstrate any age-related differences in these acute adrenergic responses.\r"

In vitro studies showed that the circular smooth muscle, obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis or from a rabbit model of experimental colitis, generated decreased force compared to muscle not associated with mucosal inflammation. The decrease in muscle contraction was observed with bethanechol stimulation or electrical field stimulation. Since the response to an increased extracellular concentration of potassium [( K+]0) was also diminished, the decreased response appears to be caused by an abnormality in the intrinsic contractile mechanism of colonic smooth muscle. Further studies are necessary to determine if metabolic abnormalities are present in the colonic muscle in patients with colitis.\r"

Activity was found associated with the microsomal fraction: rat liver was the most active, hydrolyzing 76 pmol/min.mg protein of T3SO4 while preparations from rat kidney and brain were about 1/5 and 1/20 as active. Microsomal preparations from human liver obtained at autopsy were as active as fresh rat preparations. Thyroxine sulfate was not an active substrate. Microsomes prepared with dithiothreitol and EDTA in order to detect deiodinating activity maintained T3SO4-desulfating activity. Cytosolic preparations containing arylsulfatase activities failed to desulfate T3SO4. Estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and nitrophenyl sulfate are known substrates for microsome-associated arylsulfatase activities, and these compounds were found to inhibit hydrolysis of T3SO4 to various extents. Of these competing sulfatase substrates, only dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate inhibits T3SO4 desulfation completely. In order to determine whether desulfation occurs in intact cells, isolated hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of 7 and 54 microM T3SO4. These cells were found to hydrolyze 1-1.5% of the sulfate ester/h for up to 3 h. The demonstration of this activity raises the possibility that these hepatic cells may be able to reactivate T3SO4, which has generally been regarded as an irreversibly inactivated metabolite.\r"

The hypersensitive negative feedback relationship between the ovaries and the hypothalamo-pituitary axis in developing ferrets was disrupted by infusion of a specific antiserum to 17 beta-estradiol. The effect of this treatment on gonadotropin secretion and ovarian morphology was contrasted with that observed in intact age-matched control females treated with a nonimmune gamma-globulin preparation. Infusion of the antibody into intact immature ferrets caused, within 48 h, an increase in pulsatile secretion of LH to 0.67 +/- 0.06 pulses/h over that observed in intact females treated with control gamma-globulin (0.13 +/- 0.06 pulses/h). This increase in pulse frequency was similar to that observed 48 h after ovariectomy of young animals (0.70 +/- 0.12 pulses/h). Furthermore, this level of gonadotropin secretion in antibody-treated animals resulted in stimulation of antral follicle growth in ovaries of these females. Ferrets treated with specific antiserum to 17 beta-estradiol showed a significant increase in numbers of ovarian follicles greater than 0.3 mm in diameter compared to those in ovaries of females treated with control gamma-globulin. These data strongly suggest that the limiting event at puberty in the ferret is the rise in gonadotropin secretion which is allowed by the pubertal decrease in efficacy of 17 beta-estradiol to inhibit gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have used a monoclonal antibody (9A7) against the purified avian 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor to develop an immunocytochemical technique for visualization of the protein in fixed tissues and cultured cells. In Bouin's-fixed, chick intestine, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor-like immunoreactivity was localized mainly in nuclei of epithelial cells and was more abundant in the crypt than in the villar cells. Receptor staining was low or undetectable in liver hepatocytes but was present in nuclei of cells lining the hepatic sinusoids. In rat brain, receptor-like immunoreactivity was abundant and widely distributed, but did not always coincide with the presence of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor was absent from cerebellar Purkinje cells that contained abundant calcium-binding protein. In disaggregated rat bone cells, receptor immunoreactivity was present in mononuclear cells including osteoblasts and fibroblasts but was absent from osteoclasts. Two separate clones of osteoblast-like, rat osteosarcoma cells, shown in previous studies to be either receptor positive (17/2.8) or negative (24.1), demonstrated nuclear immunoreactivity in exact concordance with receptor levels as determined by ligand binding. The phenomenon of hormone-induced up-regulation of receptor was visualized in receptor-positive 3T6 fibroblasts by demonstration of markedly enhanced nuclear reactivity in cells treated with 10(-7) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 48 h. Our studies demonstrate the feasibility of the immunocytochemical approach to visualize the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor in target tissues and show that it is predominantly a nuclear protein in the relatively unoccupied and fully activated states. Moreover, the vitamin D-dependent calcium binding is not a universal marker for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 action. Rather, our observations suggest that the expression of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor may be connected with the state of cellular differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In both primary cultures and transformed tumor cultures of rat pituitary cells, preincubation with T3 or dexamethasone increases GH secretion, mRNA accumulation, and gene transcription. GRF stimulates secretion and transcription in primary rat pituitary cultures. Sex steroids stimulate GH secretion in man, but contradictory findings have been reported in vitro. We studied the hormonal regulation of bovine GH (bGH) in primary monolayer cultures of adult bovine pituitaries. Neither T3 nor dexamethasone changed immunoreactive bGH secretion during a 3-h experimental incubation. After 72-h preincubation with T3 or dexamethasone, bGH secretion remained unchanged. T3 (10(-8) M) or dexamethasone (10(-8) M) did not alter the bGH secretory response to doses of GRF from 10(-12)-10(-8) M. However, T3 (P less than 0.001; r = 0.73) and dexamethasone (P less than 0.001; r = -0.71) decreased bGH mRNA content in dose-dependent fashions, as determined by Northern analysis and RNA dot blots probed with 32P-labeled bGH cDNA. T3 10(-7) M) decreased bGH mRNA content to 70% of the control value, 10(-7) M dexamethasone decreased bGH mRNA content to 77% of the control value, while GRF increased bGH mRNA content to 174% of the control value in a dose-dependent fashion (P less than 0.001; r = 0.72). Preincubation with testosterone or dihydrotestosterone did not change basal or GRF-stimulated GH secretion. Seventy-two-hour preincubation with 10(-8) M estradiol did not alter basal GH secretion, but increased the bGH secretory response to doses of GRF from 10(-11)-10(-8) M (P less than 0.001). Incubation with estradiol did not change bGH mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to rat GH mRNA, bGH mRNA accumulation is inhibited by T3 and dexamethasone. Estradiol augments the response to GRF, but this effect is not mediated by an increase in mRNA content. The hormonal responses of somatotropes vary significantly among mammalian species.\r"

However, because GH secretion is pulsatile and the effect of acute changes in serum GH concentrations on liver GH receptors is unknown, we measured total (MgCl2-treated homogenates) and free (water-treated homogenates) GH-binding sites in the livers of hypophysectomized (hypox) rats killed between 1 and 24 h after a single sc injection of rat GH (100 micrograms/100 g BW; n = 29). Control hypox rats (n = 10) were studied immediately or 3 h after injection of vehicle. GH injection caused profound decreases in both total and free liver GH receptors, but these changes followed different kinetic patterns. Free receptors declined rapidly (to 17% of control), reaching a nadir at the same time (1 h) as the maximal GH concentration in serum. These free receptors then increased, returning to normal 12 h after GH injection. In contrast, total GH receptors were slightly increased at 1 h, decreased to their minimal value at 6 h (53% of control), and returned to normal at 12 h. Serum immunoreactive somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I concentrations peaked 12 h after GH injection. Total and free liver GH receptors were quantitated in hypox rats that had been injected 3 h previously with doses of rat GH from 2.5-500 micrograms/100 g BW or with vehicle. Both total and free binding sites decreased in a dose-dependent manner; the maximal responses were 40% and 90% below control values, respectively. Half-maximal reductions in GH binding were achieved when 10 micrograms GH/100 g BW were given. These data suggest that a surge of GH in serum leads to a time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of the liver somatogenic binding sites and are consistent with ligand-induced internalization and degradation of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The androgen-binding protein (ABP) has been purified from rat testes with a yield of 14% using four steps of HPLC and was subsequently iodinated to a specific activity of 0.1 mCi/mg protein. Using a micromanipulator, [125I] iodo-ABP-dihydrotestosterone was injected intraluminally into the proximal caput of the rat epididymis. Epididymides were sampled from 3 to 120 min after the injection of the tracer and processed for transmission electron microscopy autoradiography. Our results showed the accumulation of detectable radioactive sources in the apical cytoplasm of only one of the epithelial cell type lining the ductus, the principal cells. In the interval from 3 to 120 min, the iodinated ABP was mainly present in the supranuclear region and was especially concentrated over coated structures, endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and over the Golgi apparatus. The same pattern was obtained using [3H]dihydrotestosterone-ABP complex instead of iodinated ABP. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the log time and the distribution of the silver grains in the luminal border and in the compartment of the apical vesicles. On the contrary, there was a positive correlation between the log time and the distribution of the silver grains in the Golgi apparatus. These results provide, for the first time, direct histological evidence of the in vivo ABP internalization by the principal cells. Since horseradish peroxidase, a fluid-phase endocytosis marker, when injected under the same conditions was internalized in both apical and principal cells, since labeled radioactive ABP appeared to be bound to the membrane of the endocytic apparatus rather than to its content, and since this binding and uptake could be prevented in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ABP, it is concluded that the internalization of ABP could not be a nonspecific fluid-phase endocytosis but should be dependent on its interaction with the apical plasma membrane of the principal cell. It still remains to be determined if these mechanisms involve the binding of ABP to a specific membrane receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine markedly amplifies the response of isolated rat and human luteal cells to LH via an intracellular site of action that is associated with an increase in cell ATP levels. This effect of adenosine is maximal in midstage cells and minimal at the onset of functional regression in late stage luteal cells. The objective of the present studies was to evaluate the role of mitochondria in mediating the action of adenosine in isolated rat luteal cells and to assess whether mitochondrial function may be compromised in regressing luteal cells. The present studies show that adenosine produced a significant increase in luteal cell levels of ADP and ATP, but had no effect on cell levels of GTP. Since ADP stimulates oxidative phosphorylation, we evaluated the role of mitochondria in mediating the amplification of LH action by adenosine in luteal cells with two mitochondrial inhibitors, oligomycin and dinitrophenol. Both inhibitors markedly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the presence or absence of adenosine. In parallel, both inhibitors decreased basal and adenosine-elevated ATP levels in a dose-related manner. Although late stage luteal cells showed a marked reduction in adenosine amplification of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation, no change in adenosine-dependent elevation of cell levels of ATP was seen. We conclude that amplification of LH action and elevation of ATP levels in midstage cells by adenosine requires an increase in oxidative phosphorylation that is stimulated by an increase in cell levels of ADP. However, attenuation of adenosine amplification of LH action in late stage luteal cells is not due to impaired ATP production.\r"

  ".W": "A plasmid expression vector encoding human insulin-like growth factor I (hIGF-I) in the form of a 97-amino acid precursor protein containing the first 27 amino acids of prebovine GH and the 70 amino acids of hIGF-I has been used to transform mouse L cells. A stably transformed mouse L cell clone has been isolated which expresses and secretes hIGF-I. The secreted peptide comprises 3% of the protein in conditioned medium. IGF-I can be purified to homogeneity in 2 chromatographic steps. One liter of conditioned medium yields approximately 200 micrograms purified peptide. Amino-terminal sequence analysis confirms that the signal peptide has been proteolytically hydrolyzed from the precursor protein before secretion to form [Ala0]hIGF-I. The recombinant peptide and serum-derived hIGF-I are equipotent as inhibitors of the binding of [125I]IGF-I to the type 1 receptor of human placenta and to a crude preparation of acid-stable human serum binding proteins. The peptides are equipotent in 2 in vitro assays, the stimulation of the rate of 2-[1,2-N-3H]deoxyglucose transport in BC3H1 cells and the stimulation of [methyl-3-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in A10 cells. In contrast to a control mouse L cell line, DNA synthesis in the [Ala0]IGF-I-secreting line is completely unresponsive to [Thr59]IGF-I, while it responds normally to calf serum (10%). Thus, the [Ala0]IGF-I-secreting line is selectively desensitized to IGF-I. The binding of [125I]IGF-I to both lines is identical, indicating that the loss of responsiveness to IGF-I is not due to a loss of cell surface receptor. The ability to render mouse L cells unresponsive to IGF-I is transferred in the conditioned medium of the [Ala0]IGF-I-secreting cell line. In addition, pretreatment of control cells with [Thr59]IGF-I (10 nM) results in attenuation of the response to a subsequent dose of IGF-I. These data indicate that prolonged exposure to high levels of IGF-I may cause a postreceptor-mediated desensitization to IGF-I. Alternatively, IGF-I may promote secretion of an inhibitor of IGF-mediated DNA synthesis.\r"

It has recently been established that dynorphin precursor-derived peptides are colocalized with vasopressin (VP) in the secretory granules in nerve terminals of the neural lobe, and that the opiate receptors in the neural lobe are restricted to the kappa-subtype. Therefore, we hypothesized that dynorphin, which is copackaged and thus coreleased with VP, is the endogenous opioid that inhibits release from neighboring oxytocin (OT) terminals. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of dynorphin-(1-8), dynorphin-(1-17), and naloxone on the electrically stimulated release of OT and VP from isolated rat neurointermediate lobes throughout a range of stimulus frequencies. Both dynorphin-(1-8) and -(1-17) (2 microM) produced a substantial reduction in OT release during a 4-Hz stimulus, and this effect was abolished by naloxone (10 microM). Neither form of dynorphin, however, affected OT secretion at a stimulus frequency of 12 or 30 Hz at concentrations up to 10 microM. Naloxone (10 microM) by itself did not affect OT release during the 4-Hz stimulus, but it produced a substantial increase in OT release at a stimulus frequency of 12 Hz. In contrast, neither form of dynorphin produced inhibition, nor did naloxone augment VP secretion at any frequency tested. Frequency-dependent secretion curves (4, 8, 12, 20, and 30 Hz) for OT and VP in the presence and absence of naloxone indicated that the degree of naloxone augmentation of OT release at a given stimulus frequency was positively correlated with the amount of VP release at that frequency. These data support the hypothesis that dynorphin released in parallel with VP during in vitro stimulations of the rat neurohypophysis simultaneously inhibits stimulated OT release.\r"

  ".W": "[3H]1-Desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin [3H] DDAVP was assessed as a radioligand for vasopressin V2-receptors by studying its membrane-binding characteristics and in vitro autoradiographic localization in rat kidney, a rich source of V2-receptors. [3H]DDAVP bound specifically to a single class of high affinity, low capacity sites in rat medullopapillary membranes. Specific [3H]DDAVP binding at 25 C reached equilibrium after 2 h of incubation and was saturable and linear with protein concentration up to 2.2 mg/ml protein. Saturation analysis gave an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.76 nM. Displacement of [3H]DDAVP binding by unlabeled arginine vasopressin (AVP) and related analogs gave the following order of potency, consistent with that expected for a V2-receptor: DDAVP approximately equal to AVP approximately equal to 1-desamino-AVP greater than lysine vasopressin greater than oxytocin greater than [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene-propionic acid, 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]AVP. The C-terminal metabolites of AVP, (pGlu4Cyt6)AVP-(4-9), and (pGlu4Cyt6)AVP-(4-8) did not displace [3H]DDAVP binding. No degradation of [3H] DDAVP during incubation could be detected by HPLC analysis. In vitro autoradiography of [3H]DDAVP binding to rat kidney sections showed a very dense localization of displaceable binding over inner and outer medulla, with a much lower density in cortex, consistent with the known major localization of V2-receptors on renal collecting tubules. These studies suggest that [3H]DDAVP is a suitable radioligand for labeling V2-receptors and may be useful in the characterization of vasopressin receptor subtypes in a variety of tissues and in purification of the V2-receptor.\r"

In ADX rats, plasma ACTH concentrations were elevated at all times compared to those in the SHAM group; pituitary ACTH content decreased during the first 12 h, then increased and was not different from that in the SHAM group thereafter. Replacement of corticosterone at the time of adrenal surgery in B-PELLET rats resulted in no differences in pituitary and plasma ACTH concentrations from SHAM values, suggesting that immediate steroid replacement prevents the major adrenalectomy-induced changes in central regulatory components governing basal activity of the adrenocortical system. Although B-PELLET rats had normal basal morning ACTH concentrations 5 days after surgery, they exhibited augmented and sustained ACTH responses to five different ACTH-releasing stimuli (injection, restraint, chlorpromazine, and, under pentobarbital anesthesia, morphine or sham adrenalectomy). The circulating corticosterone concentrations were maintained at relatively constant, low levels (3-6 micrograms/dl). Because these concentrations appear to restore basal morning ACTH concentrations to normal, but do not restore the ACTH response to stress to normal, we conclude that a different corticosterone signal is required to normalize stress-induced ACTH responses.\r"

Although lacking a feedback signal, B-PELLET rats do not secrete ACTH indefinitely after stress; plasma ACTH levels in these animals returned to those in sham-operated (SHAM) rats within 1-4 h after 2-min restraint. To distinguish between the requirement for circadian or stress-induced increases in corticosterone, we compared changes in ACTH and corticosterone levels after stress in SHAM and B-PELLET rats with those in cyanoketone-treated rats (CK) and adrenalectomized rats given corticosterone in their drinking fluid (B-WATER). B-WATER rats exhibited sustained increases in plasma corticosterone after lights-off, correlating with the nocturnal feeding period. Morning plasma corticosterone levels in B-WATER rats were constant and even lower than those in B-PELLET rats; however, B-WATER rats did not differ from SHAM rats in their ACTH response to ip injection. CK rats, which have an approximately normal circadian corticosterone rhythm but do not have significant corticosterone responses to acute stimuli, also exhibited plasma ACTH levels similar to those of SHAM rats at all times after 5-min restraint. Compared with SHAM and B-WATER rats in the same experiment, B-PELLET rats tended to hypersecrete ACTH 60 min after 5 min of restraint, but only had significantly elevated plasma ACTH relative to both groups 45 min after 10 min of restraint. We conclude that circadian, rather than stress-induced, increases in corticosterone may be sufficient for normal termination of ACTH responses to stress.\r"

  ".W": "Aromatization and 5 alpha-reduction are known to be required for the full expression of testosterone actions in neuroendocrine tissues. Although aromatase and 5 alpha-reductase activities in brain and pituitary can be experimentally manipulated by castration and steroid replacement, naturally occurring variations during seasonal reproductive cycles have not been examined in any species. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) were selected for study because they exhibit exceptionally high levels of aromatase in both brain and pituitary, although 5 alpha-reductase levels resemble the vertebrate norm. Four animals of each sex were tested monthly through three breeding seasons (2.5 yr). Using previously validated techniques, the enzymes were assayed by product formation from [3H]androstenedione in homogenates of anterior hypothalamus-preoptic area (AHPOA), remaining telencephalon (TEL), whole pituitary, ovary, and testis. Seasonal variations in aromatase were most dramatic in the AHPOA of female fish, exhibiting a peak in April and May that was 6-fold higher than the nadir in July. As judged by changes in the appearance and weight of the gonads, maximal aromatase coincided with the spawning season, whereas low enzyme levels corresponded to reproductive inactivity. Seasonal variations were similar but of a lesser magnitude in the TEL of females and in the AHPOA and TEL of males (2- to 3-fold, peak to nadir). Both ovarian and testicular aromatase showed cyclic changes; however, activity was much lower than that in brain at all times of the year (4.5, 1.2, and 47.0 pmol/mg protein, maximal values in ovaries, testes, and AHPOA, respectively). Pituitary aromatase varied from 5-22 pmol/mg protein, but was not consistently correlated with season. Cyclic changes in 5 alpha-reductase were distinctly different from those in aromatase, with maximal values in both brain and pituitary occurring when fish were reproductively inactive. In general, circulating sex steroids were high when aromatase was high and low when reductase was maximal; however, there was no apparent causal relationship suggested by temporal changes in a given steroid. Variations in testosterone metabolism, by regulating the quantity and quality of active hormone in close proximity to receptor sites, may be responsible for the changes in feedback sensitivity and behavioral responsiveness that are known to occur in seasonal breeders.\r"

  ".W": "The binding sites for mouse placental lactogen-II (mPL-II) in virgin and pregnant mouse hepatic membranes were analyzed by Scatchard analysis and affinity cross-linking. Competitive binding studies showed that mPL-II and mouse PRL (mPRL) bound to the same receptors in all liver membrane preparations, although the affinity of mPRL binding was lower than that of mPL-II binding. Two classes of receptors for mPL-II, high and low affinity, were found by Scatchard analysis. The concentration of both types of sites in liver membranes increased during pregnancy. In contrast, the affinity of both sites for mPL-II was highest in virgin female mice and declined during pregnancy. Cross-linking of [125I]iodo-mPL-II to maternal liver membranes resulted in the specific labeling of one major protein species of 67,000 daltons as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Under nonreducing conditions, two bands of approximately 63,000 and 60,000 daltons were apparent. Subtraction of the mol wt of mPL-II (22,000, reduced; 20,000, nonreduced) from the mol wt of the cross-linked complex indicated that the mol wt of the receptor was 45,000 under reducing conditions and 43,000 and 40,000 under nonreducing conditions. These observations suggest that mPL-II receptors may be present in mouse liver membranes in at least two forms.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a mouse bone marrow culture system to examine the process of osteoclast-like multinucleated cell formation from its progenitors. When mouse marrow cells were cultured for 8 days with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, 10(-10) to 10(-7) M] or human PTH (1-34) (25-100 ng/ml), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-positive multinucleated cells formed. No TRACP-positive multinucleated cells appeared in the absence of these hormones. 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 and PTH also increased the number of the clusters of TRACP-positive mononuclear cells. Time course studies showed that these TRACP-positive mononuclear cell clusters appeared before the formation of TRACP-positive multinucleated cells, suggesting that the TRACP-positive mononuclear cells are precursors of the multinucleated cells. Salmon calcitonin markedly inhibited the formation of TRACP-positive multinucleated cells but not TRACP-positive mononuclear cell clusters induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 or PTH. TRACP-positive mononuclear cells and multinucleated cells were rarely stained for nonspecific esterase, but some mononuclear cells were positively stained for both nonspecific esterase and TRACP. More that 90% of the TRACP-positive mononuclear cell clusters and multinucleated cells were found near colonies of alkaline phosphatase-positive mononuclear cells (possibly osteoblasts). When marrow mononuclear cells were cultured on sperm whale dentine slices in the presence of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 or PTH, numerous resorption lacunae were formed. These results suggest that 1) TRACP-positive multinucleated cells formed in response to osteotropic hormones in mouse marrow cultures satisfy most of the criteria of osteoclasts, and 2) osteoblasts may play an important role in osteoclast formation.\r"

Rates of esterification by the liver of fatty acid into triglyceride and other esterification products (phospholipid, diglyceride, cholesteryl esters) are higher in the female than in the male. There is evidence to suggest that GH feminizes other hepatic systems that exhibit sexual dimorphism, including hepatic steroid metabolism, PRL receptors, and estrogen binding. To investigate the role of GH in maintenance of the high rates of fatty acid esterification observed in the female, we assessed rates of [1-14C]oleic acid utilization by hepatocytes prepared from hypophysectomized (hypox) cortisol/T3-replaced female rats with an without continuous in vivo infusion of human (h) GH (5 micrograms/h). In addition, we assessed the effect of in vivo hGH treatment (5 micrograms/h) on [1-14C]oleic acid utilization in the normal male rat. Hypophysectomy was accompanied by a reduction in incorporation of [1-14C]oleic acid into products of esterification (triglyceride, phospholipid, diglyceride) and oxidation (CO2, ketone bodies). Continuous infusion of hGH (5 micrograms/h; 14 days) restored rates of fatty acid esterification in the hypox-cortisol/T3-replaced female rat, with the exception of cholesteryl esters. hGH infusion partially restored rates of fatty acid oxidation in the hypox cortisol/T3-replaced female rat. Treatment of the adult male rat with continuous infusion of hGH (5 micrograms/h; 7 days) resulted in increased rates of incorporation of [1-14C] oleic acid into triglyceride. In contrast, incorporation of oleic acid into phospholipid, diglyceride, and cholesteryl esters was unaltered. These results suggest that GH may be an important regulator of hepatic fatty acid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of neurohypophysectomy with and without vasopressin replacement on the ACTH response to hypotension and ovine CRF infusion and on the adrenocortical response to ACTH and angiotensin II infusion in conscious dogs. Nitroprusside hypotension (decrease in mean arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg) in the intact state resulted in large increases in plasma arginine vasopressin (pAVP; from 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 296 +/- 63 pg/ml) and ACTH (from 35 +/- 6 to 395 +/- 92 pg/ml). Neurohypophysectomy resulted in greatly attenuated pAVP (8.4 +/- 1.6 pg/ml) and ACTH (80 +/- 10 pg/ml) responses to hypotension which were not normalized by physiological low dose vasopressin replacement (6-18 pg/kg.min continuously, iv, for 2 weeks). However, acute administration of vasopressin (4-6 ng/kg.min) simultaneously with hypotension in the neurohypophysectomized (neurohypox) dog, which produced pAVP levels equivalent to the hypotensive response to intact dogs, almost completely normalized the ACTH response to hypotension (to 248 +/- 74 pg/ml). The ACTH response to 20 ng/kg.min ovine CRF, iv (from 43 +/- 8 to 268 +/- 77 pg/ml), was not attenuated by neurohypophysectomy. The cortisol responses to infusion of 0.5 and 2 ng/kg.min ACTH-(1-24), iv, were essentially normal in neurohypox dogs. However, the ACTH and aldosterone responses to 5 ng/kg.min angiotensin II infusion iv were attenuated in neurohypox dogs off AVP replacement. Histological examination revealed normal adrenal glands and anterior pituitaries in neurohypox dogs. Immunocytochemical staining for vasopressin and neurophysin revealed normal cell bodies in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalami from neurohypox dogs. However, median eminence staining for AVP and neurophysin was greatly diminished in neurohypox dogs. In summary, neurohypophysectomy 1) attenuated the ACTH response to hypotension and angiotensin II, but not to CRF, and 2) attenuated the aldosterone response to high dose angiotensin II. Furthermore, the deficit in ACTH secretion was almost completely normalized by increasing plasma AVP levels to those observed in the intact dogs. We conclude that an action of circulating pAVP increases ACTH secretion by a direct effect at the pituitary and by activating afferent input to the hypothalamus.\r"

The cis isomer of tamoxifen was a weak estrogen, but the cis isomer of 4-hydroxytamoxifen was converted to the trans isomer during the 6-day assay. This made an accurate determination of the properties of cis-(E)4-hydroxytamoxifen impossible. A series of fixed ring derivatives of the compounds were evaluated in the PRL synthesis assay in vitro to determine their estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. The fixed ring derivatives of tamoxifen, cis-tamoxifen and trans-(Z)4-hydroxytamoxifen all had properties that were the same as those of the original triphenylethylenes. The fixed ring derivative of the cis-(E) isomer of 4-hydroxytamoxifen was a weak competitive antagonist of estrogen action with only very slight estrogenic properties. This contrasted with the other cis isomers of triphenylethylenes. We propose that the hydroxyl group on the molecule may orient the ligand at the binding site of the estrogen receptor to place the alkylaminoethoxy side-chain in a position to produce antiestrogen action.\r"

Myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors were characterized by using (-)-[125I-cyanopindolol as the specific beta-adrenoreceptor ligand. Compared to that in the control group, E2 administration resulted in a 7-fold increase in the density of myometrial beta-adrenoreceptors. Administration of P alone resulted in a significant increase in both beta-adrenergic receptor concentration and the receptor dissociation constant (Kd). Finally, a combination of E2 and P treatment did not result in any synergistic or additive effect for the beta-adrenergic receptors, while the Kd was twice that of the control or E2-treated animals. We conclude that systemic administration of these sex steroid hormones, directly or indirectly, modulates myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations and their ligand affinity.\r"

Proenkephalin RNA was found to change markedly during the estrous cycle in both the ovary and uterus (approximately 6- and 3-fold, respectively). The highest concentrations occurred at estrus in the rat ovary and at metestrus and diestrus in the rat uterus. In sharp contrast to proenkephalin RNA, the abundance of POMC RNA remained relatively constant throughout the estrous cycle in both tissues. Similar results were obtained in the cycling hamster ovary. During pregnancy, the concentrations of proenkephalin RNA in the rat ovary showed little variation, while in the uterus a 4-fold increase in this transcript was observed. The effects of pregnancy on POMC RNA were the reverse of this pattern; its abundance increased 2-fold in the ovary and did not vary substantially in the uterus. These differences in the expression of proenkephalin and POMC genes during the estrous cycle and pregnancy suggest that these two opioid peptide precursors are associated with distinct functional roles within the female reproductive system.\r"

In both groups, the level of immunologically detectable hormone was significantly higher than that of bioactive hormone. Sera from end-stage renal disease patients and normal subjects were fractionated on a gel permeation column, and the immunoreactive erythropoietin in the fractions was measured by RIA. Three classes of immunoreactive erythropoietin were found in the sera: one eluting before the [125I]erythropoietin marker, one coinciding with the [125I]erythropoietin marker, and a third eluting after the labeled tracer in the region of the cytochrome c marker. The high and low mol wt components were more immunoreactive than the human urinary erythropoietin standard in the RIA. Biological activity, as determined in the in vitro rat bone marrow assay, was found only in the material eluting with the erythropoietin tracer. These studies show that immunoreactive erythropoietin in the serum consists of three components with different immunoreactivities: high and low mol wt components and a component with a mol wt similar to that of the native hormone.\r"

In aggregates the peptide displayed both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on GH release, depending on the hormonal conditions of the culture medium and the age of the animal. When cultured in the absence of glucocorticoid, a modest but statistically significant stimulation was seen in aggregates from immature as well as adult animals. In aggregates from 5-day-old animals, dexamethasone (DEX) strongly enhanced the GH-releasing activity of AII in a dose-dependent way; in aggregates from 14- and 25-day-old rats, the same pattern was found, although the stimulatory action was weaker than the effect in 5-day-old rats. In aggregates from adult animals, the glucocorticoid established an inhibitory effect of AII on GH release, an effect seen with both low and high concentrations of DEX. These age- and DEX-dependent effects were not found for AII stimulation of PRL release. In the presence of DEX, AII also inhibited GRF-induced GH release in aggregates from adult animals, while it was synergistic with GRF in aggregates from developing animals. The effects of AII on GH release disappeared when aggregates were redispersed into single cells. However, in these single cell preparations AII strongly stimulated PRL release. In hemipituitaries from 1-, 5-, and 14-day-old animals, AII also stimulated GH release, but no effect was seen in hemipituitaries from 25-day-old and adult animals. These data indicate that AII has dual effects on GH release depending on the developmental stage of the animal and the hormonal environment. Furthermore, since no effect of AII was seen after redispersion of aggregates into single cells, both stimulatory and inhibitory effects seem to be based on an intercellular signaling system.\r"

Using a RNA probe in a solution hybridization assay we investigated the presence of IGF-I mRNA in rat rib growth plate. Hypophysectomy resulted in a decrease in the number of IGF-I mRNA copies compared to that in normal rats. Replacement treatment with GH restored the number of transcripts in a specific and dose-dependent manner. The results show that GH regulates the level of IGF-I mRNA in rat rib growth plate and give further support to the hypothesis that locally produced IGF-I might contribute to the stimulatory effect of GH on longitudinal bone growth.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been shown that thyroid hormones are transferred from the mother to the developing rat embryo early in gestation, before the onset of fetal thyroid function. We have now studied whether there is transfer of T4 from the mother to the fetus late in gestation when the fetal thyroid is impaired. Normal and thyroidectomized females were mated, given a goitrogen [methimazole (MMI)], starting before the onset of fetal thyroid function and until term, alone or together with a constant infusion of T4 (1.8 micrograms/100 g BW.day). T4 and T3 were determined by RIA in several maternal samples and in tissues from 21-day-old fetuses. The administration of MMI blocked the fetal thyroid, as assessed from the decreased thyroid concentrations of T4 and T3. The concentrations of both iodothyronines also decreased in placenta, thyroid, plasma, brain, liver, lung, and carcass of fetuses from MMI-treated dams. Infusion of T4 into such MMI-treated mothers partly avoided this decrease, and T4 levels increased in all fetal tissues to 41-57% of those in normal fetuses. In contrast to this, T4 infusion affected the concentration of T3 to varying degrees in different tissues. The T3 concentration in plasma and lung increased very little when the MMI-treated mother was infused with T4, but in the brain T3 reached concentrations comparable to those in normal fetuses. Results not only show transfer of T4 from the mother to the fetus near term, at least when the fetal thyroid is impaired, but also suggest that it might mitigate, or avoid, the adverse effects of such failure on the developing brain.\r"

  ".U": "88151795\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the effect of progestin on the regulation of cellular progesterone receptor (PR) levels and have used dense amino acid-density shift experiments to determine the mechanism by which progestin markedly decreases PR. We have utilized T47D human breast cancer cells which contain high levels of PR and are progestin responsive. When these cells are exposed to the progestin R5020, there is a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in PR levels. Experiments with different concentrations of R5020 reveal that the rate and extent of PR decrease reflect the time course of receptor occupancy and the fractional saturation of receptor. With a high concentration of ligand (20 nM) that labels all receptors rapidly, reductions in PR levels (processing) occur immediately and proceed rapidly to levels that are 15-20% of the initial; at lower concentrations (5 nM), where it takes several hours to achieve full saturation of receptors, there is a delay before the maximal rate of processing develops and then continues to achieve final receptor levels that are 15-20% of the initial; with a low concentration of ligand (0.5 nM), binding is even slower and never reaches full receptor saturation, with the consequence that processing is not only delayed but also less complete. Immunochemical detection of PR with a monoclonal antibody (B39) reveals a good correspondence between the loss of immunoreactive and hormone binding PR, and analysis of the A (Mr 85,000) and B (Mr 115,000) receptor forms on Western blots demonstrates that both A and B receptor forms are reduced after exposure to R5020. Density labeling of PR by biosynthetic incorporation of 2H, 13C, 15N (dense) amino acids reveals that PR turns over with a half-life of 21 h in control cells. In cells exposed to 20 nM R5020, PR levels decline and receptor half-life is reduced to 6 h. In addition, there is also a time-dependent decrease in the rate constant of PR synthesis, k8, which decreases to less than 10% of its initial value after 24 h of R5020 exposure. Thus, the R5020-evoked reduction in PR levels in this progestin-sensitive cell line is due both to a marked increase in the rate of receptor degradation as well as a dramatic decrease in the rate of receptor synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), the mammalian homolog of bombesin, is often studied as a prototypic neuroregulatory hormone and growth factor, but its own regulation and physiological roles remain to be fully defined. We now demonstrate that the GRP gene is expressed in human thyroidal calcitonin (CT)-containing neuroendocrine cells (C-cells) in an ontogenic pattern similar to its expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and is also expressed at high levels in C-cell hyperplasias and neoplasias (medullary carcinomas of the thyroid). Mean GRP-like immunoreactivity is 20 times higher in 3-week-old to 5-month-old infants than in normal adults, with six of seven infants having GRP levels 6- to 67-fold higher than those in normal adults, the highest levels occurring at 2-2.5 months. CT levels are about 100 times greater than GRP levels at all time intervals, with levels of GRP and CT being linearly correlated (r = 0.98). By RNA blot analysis, GRP mRNAs are increased in neonatal thyroids compared to adult thyroids. In situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase analyses localize GRP mRNAs and peptide to a majority of C-cells in fetuses and neonates, but to only 5-18% of C-cells in normal adults. The majority of developing C-cells have a dendritic morphology, suggesting a paracrine role, although this morphology is not observed in adult C-cells. In addition, for unknown reasons, an increased percentage of C-cells positive for GRP occurs in normal thyroid adjacent to GRP-negative follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas, an association that we term perineoplastic. We hypothesize that GRP gene expression may play a role in both normal and neoplastic growth processes.\r"

  ".W": "Previous study in this laboratory revealed that estrogen stimulates synthesis and secretion of 97K glycoprotein [uterine secretory protein-1 (USP-1)] in rat uterine epithelial cells. In the present communication, the effects of progesterone and antiprogesterone (RU 38486) on estrogen-stimulated USP-1 biosynthesis were investigated. Ovariectomized rats were treated with estrogen for 4 days to induce USP-1 synthesis and secretion. Then, progesterone and RU 38486 were injected sc. After 6 and 12 h of treatment, uterine luminal fluid proteins were labeled for 6 h by direct administration of [35S]methionine into uterine lumen. By radioimmune precipitation assay using specific antibody against USP-1, it was shown that progesterone can reduce the USP-1 synthesis and secretion, which were prestimulated by estrogen. This antagonistic effect of progesterone on estrogen-induced USP-1 biosynthesis was also evident by the decreased staining intensity of USP-1 in uterine epithelial cells, as revealed by the immunohistochemical method. Although RU 38486 itself did not manifest any effect on estrogen-stimulated USP-1 biosynthesis, it completely inhibited the progesterone-induced decrease in synthesis and secretion. This system is believed to provide a useful model to analyze the progesterone and antiprogesterone actions on rat uterine epithelial cells.\r"

  ".U": "88151802\r", 
  ".W": "Acting alone or in concert with pituitary gonadotropins, catecholamines have recently been shown to enhance androgen production by ovarian theca-interstitial cells. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to further characterize this catecholaminergic activity as well as to type and subtype the putative adrenergic recognition sites mediating this phenomenon. Treatment of collagenase-processed whole ovarian dispersates or highly enriched (greater than 90%) theca-interstitial cells from immature rats with norepinephrine (10(-6) M) resulted in a 2.0-fold increment in the accumulation of androsterone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane-17-one), the main androgenic steroid identified in culture medium by HPLC. Qualitatively similar stimulation was obtained using beta (isoproterenol)- but not alpha (methoxamine)-selective adrenergic agonists. Moreover, combined treatment with both norepinephrine (10(-6) M) and hCG (1 ng/ml) unmasked a synergistic interaction subject to stereospecific blockade by beta (propranolol)- but not alpha (phentolamine)-selective adrenergic antagonists. Further probing with subtype-selective adrenergic ligands revealed terbutaline (a beta 2-selective agonist) to enhance androgen biosynthesis, with dobutamine (a beta 1-selective agonist) having little or no effect. Moreover, a beta 2 (ICI-118406)- but not a beta 1 (ICI-89406)-selective adrenergic antagonist yielded dose-dependent inhibition of the isoproterenol effect. Unaccounted for by either enhanced cellular growth or an alteration of the overall steroidogenic pattern, catecholaminergically stimulated androgen biosynthesis proved time and dose dependent but independent of the hCG dose (0.1-10 ng/ml) employed. Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to highly enriched theca-interstitial cells proved stereoselective and saturable, displaying a single class (Hill coefficient = 0.96 +/- 0.01) of high affinity (Kd = 5.6 X 10(-11) M), low capacity (1219 +/- 317 sites/cell) binding sites. The rank order of competitive potencies of selective adrenergic ligands (beta 2 greater than beta 1 greater than alpha), was consistent with a beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtype. Taken together, these findings suggest that catecholaminergic stimulation of ovarian androgen biosynthesis is mediated via beta 2-adrenergic recognition sites, the role of which may now be studied.\r"

  ".W": "The early biochemical events following exposure of human target cells to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] have been difficult to study due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems. We have studied the T47 D human breast cancer cell line, which possesses specific high affinity receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and responds to the hormone with changes in cellular replication, as a functional model of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive human cells. Specific uptake and binding of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 by T47 D cells follows a time course of relatively slow rise and decline. The time of peak binding is delayed relative to that of other steroid hormones in the same system. We have studied the kinetics of 1,25-(OH)2D3 specific uptake and binding in intact cells and Scatchard analysis in broken cell preparations of three T47 D sublines: the wild-type and the 10 and M1 sublines. Binding parameters varied among the three sublines. Thus, peak binding capacity was highest in the wild-type cell and lowest in the M1 subline; ranging from 10-65 fmol/10(6) cells in intact cell studies and from 23-148 fmol/mg protein (approximately 2.8-12.7 fmol/10(6) cells) in broken cell preparations. Receptor affinity in the three sublines ranged from 1.1-2.8 x 10(-11) M. The half-life of occupied receptor was estimated in intact cells of all three sublines by incubation in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. Similar analyses were made of apparent half-life of unoccupied receptor in broken cell preparations of the wild-type and T47-10 cells. The half-life of occupied 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor was estimated to be 2.8 +/- 0.4 h in intact wild-type T47 D cells compared with 3.1 +/- 0.7 and 1.4 +/- 0.2 hours in intact T47 D-10 and T47 D-M1 cells, respectively. The half-life of unoccupied 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor was estimated in broken cell preparations to be 4.1 +/- 0.7 h in wild-type T47 D and 4.2 +/- 0.6 h in the T47 D-10 cells. Receptor half-lives in the wild-type and T47 D-10 cells were not different in either intact or broken cell preparations; however, receptor half-life was 40% longer (P less than 0.05) in broken cell preparations (4.2 +/- 0.4 h) than in the intact cells (3.0 +/- 0.4 h) of the two cell sublines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adult female mice of the DDY/S strain were used to study the distribution of PRL or GH cells and the vasculature of the anterior pituitary lobe. Electron microscopy was used to quantify PRL or GH cells in horizontal sections. Most parenchymal cells were either PRL or GH cells, and both types of cells were present in all regions. The densities of PRL cells in the rostral and caudal areas were significantly greater than that of GH cells. The density of GH cells was greater in the anterolateral wings. Thus, the spatial differences in concentrations of PRL and GH cells were reversed. The vasculature was studied with scanning electron microscopy of vascular casts and with stereoscopy of pituitary glands injected with India ink. The adenohypophysis was supplied by long and short portal vessels. The long portal vessels originated from the primary capillary plexus on the median eminence and the upper portion of the pituitary stalk, and they supplied rostral regions of the adenohypophysis. Most of the short portal vessels connected caudal areas of the anterior lobe with the posterior lobe, crossing the surface of the intermediate lobe. The blood in the short portal vessels may flow from the posterior lobe toward the anterior lobe. Thus, within the rostral and caudal areas, which are supplied by long and short portal vessels, respectively, PRL cells predominated; the anterolateral wings where GH cells predominated were far from these regions. These data suggest that the anatomical pattern of the blood supply may account in part for the spatial distribution of PRL and GH cells.\r"

  ".W": "31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to study the effects of 17 beta-estradiol on the content of phosphates and on the flux catalyzed by creatine kinase in immature rat uteri. Perifusion with oxygenated medium at 36 C maintained the uteri in a viable state for at least 10 h in vitro during 31P NMR measurements. In vitro administration of 17 beta-estradiol to the perifused uteri induced changes in the concentration of the high energy phosphates similar to those found after in vivo stimulation: a rapid fall in the concentrations of ATP, phospho-creatine, and the phosphomonoesters during the first 2 h, followed by a slower return to initial concentrations by approximately 6 h. Analysis of the time course of this modulation indicated that after estrogen stimulation, the energy utilization rate was about twice the production rate. The flux through the creatine kinase (CK) reaction was measured independently using 31P magnetization transfer techniques; it was found to increase in uteri 24 h after estradiol injection by the same extent (65%) as the specific activity of CK measured by a spectrophotometric assay. The congruence between the results of these two techniques (in the absence of increased substrate concentrations) provides evidence that the early stimulation of brain-type CK synthesis by estrogen results in a net increase in the concentration of this enzyme.\r"

Treatment with VIP alone increased cAMP accumulation less than 5-fold, and treatment with phenylephrine increased cAMP accumulation less than 2-fold. However, combined treatment with VIP and phenylephrine increased cAMP accumulation more than 20-fold. This is the first report that alpha 1-adrenergic and VIP receptors can interact to regulate cAMP in a cell of neural tube origin. The demonstration of such an integrated mechanism in pinealocytes is of special interest because VIP innervation of the pineal gland is of central origin, and adrenergic innervation is of peripheral origin. The magnitude of response makes the pinealocyte an attractive model for the study of such dual receptor regulation.\r"

Although the pathophysiology is obscure, increased permeation of toxic bacterial products across the inflamed gut to the portal circulation might be one mechanism. Potentially toxic metabolites include N-formylated chemotactic peptides that are produced by several species of intestinal bacteria and can be detected in colonic fluid in vivo. To investigate the metabolic fate of one of these low molecular weight proinflammatory peptides, N-formyl L-methionine L-leucine 125I-L-tyrosine was introduced into colon loops of healthy rats (n = 10) and rats with experimental colitis (n = 15) induced by rectal instillation of 15% (vol/vol) acetic acid. Gut, liver, and blood radioactivity were monitored by external gamma-counting and radioactivity in bile was measured by biliary catheter drainage into a well counter. Bile was processed by high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the amount of intact, bioactive peptide excreted over 3 h. After colonic instillation of 1 nmol of peptide, the mean (+/- SEM) biliary excretion of intact peptide was 6.4 +/- 2.0 pmol in normal rats and 49.0 +/- 20 pmol in rats with colitis (p less than 0.01). An enterohepatic circulation of synthetic N-formyl L-methionine L-leucine L-tyrosine has been demonstrated in the rat. Experimental colitis was associated with an eightfold increase in biliary excretion of this proinflammatory bacterial peptide. Proinflammatory bacterial peptides synthesized by colonic bacteria could be important in the pathophysiology of colon inflammation and its frequently associated hepatobiliary complications.\r"

  ".W": "Exocrine pancreatic response to food is believed to result from the interaction of neural and hormonal factors, but their contribution in the net postprandial secretion is unknown. Recent description of a highly specific and potent cholecystokinin (CCK)-receptor antagonist permitted the evaluation of the physiologic role of CCK in postprandial pancreatic secretion. In dogs with chronic pancreatic fistula, CCK antagonism caused little alteration in sham feeding- or urecholine-induced pancreatic protein secretion, but reduced by approximately 60% the pancreatic protein response to a gastrointestinal meal and virtually abolished the pancreatic responses to duodenal perfusion with amino acids or oleate and to exogenous CCK, but not to secretin or neurotensin. The pancreatic protein responses, particularly to lower doses of gastrin, were also reduced by CCK-receptor antagonist, but no changes in the responses to secretin or neurotensin were detected. Cholecystokinin antagonism also significantly reduced the pancreatic polypeptide responses to CCK, gastrin, and the gastrointestinal meal, possibly due to removal of the CCK-mediated release of pancreatic polypeptide. We conclude that CCK plays a crucial role in the mediation of the gastrointestinal phase, but not the cephalic phase, of pancreatic secretion.\r"

One month after bead implantation, dogs with an intact sphincter passed 52%, 26%, 22%, 10%, 0%, and 0% of beads with diameters of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm, respectively. For the same respective bead diameters, dogs with a sphincterotomy passed 90%, 90%, 88%, 75%, 75%, and 42% of beads (p less than 0.05 for all bead diameters). No beads were in the common bile duct of any dog. In separate dogs studied by cholescintigraphy, sphincterotomy significantly increased gallbladder ejection fraction from 0.46 to 0.76 (p less than 0.01). In addition, sphincterotomy significantly lowered resting gallbladder volume from 24.4 to 15.8 ml (p less than 0.025) and lowered cholecystokinin-stimulated gallbladder volume from 13.3 to 5.9 ml (p less than 0.025). These data indicate that even with an intact sphincter, small solids can pass from the gallbladder and into the duodenum. Sphincterotomy facilitates passage of solids, apparently by general improvement in gallbladder emptying. Facilitated passage of crystals, microliths, or small stones seems the most likely explanation for prevention of gallstone formation by sphincterotomy.\r"

In dogs, the intraduodenal administration of a bile salt sequestrant, cholestyramine (2, 4, or 8 g/h), resulted in a dose-related enhancement of the release of cholecystokinin-33/39 and pancreatic protein secretion in response to intraduodenal administration of amino acids. Intraduodenal administration of cholestyramine alone did not affect basal levels of cholecystokinin-33/39 or pancreatic protein secretion. Total diversion of bile also significantly increased the release of cholecystokinin and pancreatic protein secretion in response to intraduodenal administration of amino acids. Replacement of the bile salt pool by intraduodenal administration of taurocholate completely reversed the enhancement effect of both cholestyramine and bile diversion. In humans, oral ingestion of cholestyramine (12 g) significantly increased the release of cholecystokinin-33/39 and gallbladder contraction in response to the oral ingestion of either a triglyceride or amino acids. These results support a physiologic role of bile salts in the negative feedback regulation of release of cholecystokinin in response to luminal nutrients.\r"

We hypothesized that, in the withdrawal state, hepatic oxygen consumption and delivery could be altered in relation to an increased sympathetic activity. Thirteen chronic alcoholics were studied 34-72 h after withdrawal and 10 days later (control period) using conventional hemodynamic methods. As compared with the control period, splanchnic oxygen uptake was elevated at withdrawal (74.5 +/- 27.1 vs. 59.2 +/- 16.8 ml/min, p less than 0.025) and its variation was correlated with that of plasma epinephrine (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). The hepatic venous oxygen content was reduced at withdrawal (113 +/- 22 vs. 126 +/- 21 ml/L, p less than 0.025) and correlated inversely with plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). We conclude that, during alcohol withdrawal in humans, hepatic energy expenditure may be elevated in relation to epinephrine secretion and that sympathetic overactivity may hinder the adaptive response in hepatic blood flow. The wide range in sympathetic nervous response to alcohol withdrawal could explain some differences in individual susceptibility to liver damage caused by alcohol.\r"

Among these 14 patients, the main clue to the presence of the myeloproliferative disorder was (a) the observation of suggestive abnormalities of peripheral blood cell counts in 4 patients; (b) characteristic findings at bone marrow biopsy or determination of total red cell volume in 3 patients; and (c) formation of \"spontaneous\" erythroid colonies in cultures of bone marrow progenitor cells in erythropoietin-poor medium in 7 patients. In 2 other patients, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia with myelosclerosis of apparently recent onset developed 5 yr after recognition of portal vein thrombosis. In conclusion, primary myeloproliferative disorders--in a full-blown or latent form, or at an early stage--are a major cause of portal vein thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Cervical spinal cord transection is used as a model of mammalian stress ulcerogenesis. Circadian variations in gastric ulceration have been demonstrated in other animal models. We investigated whether gastric ulceration changed after cervical cord transection throughout a 24-h period by subjecting different groups of rats to cord transection. Ulcers were quantitated using an index described by Szabo and colleagues. Ulcer formation showed significant variation as a function of time of lesioning, with least severe ulceration at 8 AM. We found that cord transection, like other models of gastric ulceration, is also influenced by the circadian system.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of colorectal cancer was studied in an unselected group of 1035 patients (total group) with ulcerative colitis and in a subgroup of 822 who resided, at the time of diagnosis, within a defined area in central Israel (regional group). The operation rate was 5.2% and the follow-up period (mean +/- SD) was 11.5 +/- 8.3 yr, range 1-52 yr. The cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer in all patients was 0.2% at 10 yr, 2.8% at 15 yr, 5.5% at 20 yr, and 13.5% at 30 yr. The ratio of observed to expected cancer was 0.9 at 10 yr, 5.0 at 20 yr, and 6.4 at 30 yr. The cancer incidence was 1 case per 3895 patient-years in the first decade of disease, 1 case per 198 patient-years in the second decade, and 1 case per 100 patient-years in the third decade. All these figures were higher in patients with total colonic involvement. There were no significant differences between the total and regional patient groups. Onset of ulcerative colitis in the first and second decade of life was not associated with a higher cancer incidence when standardized for extent and duration of disease. The risk of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis was more strongly expressed in population groups with a lower incidence of this cancer. The cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis is much lower in population-based studies than that reported from major medical centers. Worldwide this incidence may also vary among different populations.\r"

  ".U": "88152421\r", 
  ".W": "Noncardiac chest pain can be a diagnostic dilemma because patients rarely experience spontaneous chest pain in the laboratory. Therefore, we studied 24 patients with chronic, daily, substernal chest pain with a prototype 24-h ambulatory esophageal motility and pH system. Spontaneous chest pain episodes were correlated with pH less than 4 and abnormal motility changes (mean amplitude and duration, maximum amplitude and duration, or percentage of abnormal peristalsis) defined as exceeding the patient's normal esophageal motility pattern. Twenty-two patients experienced a total of 92 spontaneous chest pain episodes. Eleven chest pain episodes (12%) occurred during abnormal motility, whereas 18 episodes (20%) were associated with pH less than 4 and four episodes (4%) had both abnormalities. The majority of chest pain episodes, 59 events (64%), did not have any association with motility or pH. Abnormal maximum duration and amplitude were the motility changes most frequently associated with chest pain. Overall, 13 of 22 patients (59%) had at least one chest pain episode correlating with abnormal motility or pH (range 33%-100%). Therefore, we conclude that ambulatory esophageal motility and pH monitoring is useful in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain. pH abnormalities (20%) are more commonly associated with chest pain than motility abnormalities (12%). However, the majority of chest pain episodes (64%) did not correlate with either abnormality and may be the result of lowered esophageal pain threshold for distention, i.e., the \"irritable esophagus.\"\r"

Subjects were studied twice in the hospital and twice as outpatients. The dietary conditions were strictly controlled and the replicate studies were compared to assess the variability of such recordings of acidity. The accuracy of the technique was assessed, and a detection limit for differences was calculated for commonly used time periods. Over 24 h, during the night, during the day, and during the evening the technique is able to detect consistent changes of pH of greater than 0.1 units. During separate 5-min periods the limits of detection were considerably greater. This study demonstrates the variability of 24-h intragastric acidity and confirms that continuous monitoring is able to detect important changes of acidity under both hospitalized and ambulant conditions.\r"

Two were symptomatic at birth and 2 were symptomatic by 3 wk of age. All had abdominal distention and emaciation, 3 of the 4 had severe obstipation and fecal impactions, and 3 had signs of urologic obstruction. All had gaseous distention of the small bowel and colon, and barium studies showed dilated small bowel and colon, with slow transport through the small intestine. Two of 3 had enlarged stomachs and slowed gastric emptying, and 3 had dilated bladders and ureters. The 1 infant studied by esophageal manometry had absence of esophageal contractions. Despite total parenteral nutrition in 3, all died within 10-18 mo. The pathologic features of visceral myopathy were identified in variable sample sites from the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, bladder, and ureter of the 4 infants. Of 170 family members related to 3 of the infants, there was no consanguinity and no one appeared to be clinically affected. Thus, an infantile form of visceral myopathy exists which, pathologically, is identical to the familial and sporadic forms of visceral myopathy previously identified in adolescents and adults.\r"
