  ".W": "The success of screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer partly depends on women's acceptance and take-up of the service. Uptake of preventive health care programmes appears to be related to people's underlying motivations and attitudes, not only towards the disease in question, but towards health and illness generally. The perceived costs to the individual of embarking on particular courses of action also have to be taken into consideration. These attitudes and motivations vary between social groups. Unless the reasons for non-participation in preventive health care and screening programmes is understood, programmes will be misdirected and inappropriately designed. However, the failure of any one theory to account for most of the variance in health behaviour between social groups emphasizes the importance of health education and provision of information about health and prevention on a personal basis. General practitioners and practice based nurses are in a good position to be able to elicit the fears, prejudices and priorities of patients in this area, and thus provide more effective health education and information about preventive and screening services.\r"

  ".U": "90006512\r", 
  ".W": "This issue of 'Selections' focuses on studies of cholesterol reduction in asymptomatic adults. Treatment of persons with coronary heart disease involves other issues and the need to consider additional evidence from other studies. Elevated blood cholesterol levels are associated with increased coronary heart disease in young adults. The real question is whether or not lowering cholesterol levels with diet and drugs is possible and if possible, whether it reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality. Even if the relative risk can be reduced it is necessary to consider the absolute risk reduction. Reduction of the risk of fatal myocardial infarction from 2.0% to 1.6% over a seven year period while at the same time increasing the risk for gallbladder surgery from 1.3% to 1.9% may not be an attractive gamble. There is little evidence that elevated cholesterol levels are a risk factor in adults over the age of 60 years. Intervention trials have not been conducted in women or in the aged, and overall mortality has not been reduced in any of the studies. The Department of Health and Human Services of the United States recommends an approach that if implemented could have initial costs that exceed 10 billion dollars. Yearly costs are likely to exceed the initial cost. In a recent editorial Professor Joseph Herman expresses concern that the Israel Society for Research on Atherosclerosis and the European Atherosclerosis Society have adopted similar recommendations to those recently announced in the United States. He also points to large variations reported from 5000 laboratories given standard samples to be tested for total cholesterol. Currently blood cholesterol levels are available to shoppers at a supermarket in Florida (New York Times 1989, January 3). The end of this controversy is not yet in sight.\r"

In the present study, immune reactivity was assessed with a histochemical indirect immunoperoxidase assay on paraplast-embedded tissue sections. The reactive lymph node cells were identified as sinus macrophages. We confirmed earlier findings of immunofluorescence studies that the reaction showed some antibody specificity, the proportion of patients with Crohn's disease who were positive (84%) being higher than of patients with ulcerative colitis (29%). However, reactivity of Crohn's disease sera was found to be antigen nonspecific, as it was equally observed with lymph nodes of mice primed with saline or with homogenates from patients with ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or volvulus. Hence, this nude mouse model does not seem appropriate to identify a transmissible etiology of Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".U": "90006556\r", 
  ".W": "Although parenteral neurotensin (NT) inhibits stimulated gastric acid secretion, published reports on the effect of centrally administered NT on gastric acid secretion are conflicting. This study provides evidence suggesting that, in chronic gastric fistula rats, intracerebroventricularly administered NT (15-60 micrograms) significantly reduces both basal and pentagastrin-, 2-deoxy-D-glucose-, and carbachol-but not histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Using radioimmunoassay, the concentration of plasma immunoreactive NT increased from 30 to 200 pg/ml at 30 and 60 min, respectively after a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NT at a dose of 60 micrograms. These serum NT concentrations can be reproduced by a constant NT i.v. infusion at 2 micrograms/kg.h. This parenteral infusion dose does not inhibit acid secretion as does i.c.v. NT. Pretreatment with the i.c.v. dopamine-2 receptor antagonists haloperidol or domperidone totally abolishes the inhibitory effect of i.c.v. NT on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. In contrast, pretreatment with the specific dopamine-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23900 or the specific dopamine-2 receptor antagonist sulpiride does not affect i.c.v. NT-induced inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Pretreatment (intracerebroventricularly) with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine blocks the antisecretory effect of i.c.v. NT. Administration of 3.0 micrograms NT per side directly into nucleus accumbens (NACB), using a stereotaxic technique, significantly reduces basal gastric acid secretion. This effect of central NT is blocked by pretreatment with intra-NACB haloperidol (0.5 microgram per side). These findings suggest that NT acts centrally to inhibit gastric acid secretion, an effect that may occur within NACB and be mediated by central nervous system alpha-adrenergic receptor activation.\r"

Distribution of IF has previously been described only in the stomach (parietal, chief cells), duodenum (mucous cells), and pancreatic juice. Cells containing R protein have been reported to be more widespread, including mucin-secreting cells of the intestinal tract. To further clarify the cells producing these cobalamin binders in the various organs, we surveyed a number of tissues in four species, with monospecific antisera raised against rat IF and hog R protein, using indirect immunoperoxidase histochemistry. A positive staining pattern was confirmed after blocking with the appropriate protein purified to homogeneity. Strong IF staining was noted over chief cells in the rat stomach, with weaker but substantial staining in the parietal cells as well. Intrinsic factor was found only in parietal cells in all other species examined. R protein was found in parietal cells of all species tested, except in the hog, where mucous cells of the basal crypt stained. The area of the brush border and apical cytoplasm in small intestinal epithelial cells was also positive for both IF and R protein, probably reflecting uptake. Accessory digestive organs, such as salivary gland and pancreas were also positive for both IF and R protein in the secretory ducts. Accessory digestive organs contribute to the secretion of IF as well as R protein, but the physiologic importance of this IF secretion is not clear.\r"

In all patients on ursodeoxycholic acid, mean values of serum glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase fell significantly by 48%-79% after 18-24 wk; 7 of 10 showed a mean decrease of 35% in immunoglobulin M after 24 wk. Prothrombin time, serum bilirubin, albumin, the antipyrin breath test, and plasma disappearance of indocyanine green were normal initially and did not change. Total serum bile acid concentrations increased; ursodeoxycholic acid became the predominant bile acid. No significant improvement occurred in the placebo group. Hepatic histology improved in 6 patients of the ursodeoxycholic acid group but deteriorated in 4 patients receiving placebo. In studies with erythrocyte membranes, changes in electron spin resonance revealed that ursodeoxycholic acid was less toxic than chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acid, and coaddition of ursodeoxycholic acid prevented their toxic effect.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, a potent antiviral agent, which, following anabolic phosphorylation, inhibits the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus in vitro, was assessed in 16 Pekin ducks chronically infected with the duck hepatitis B virus. Nine ducks were given 11 mg/m2 of dideoxycytidine intravenously every 6 h, and 7 ducks received no treatment. Serum duck hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity decreased in every duck treated with dideoxycytidine. The mean inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase and duck hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid on the third day of treatment measured 64% (p less than 0.01) and 73% (p less than 0.01), respectively. The inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase persisted after treatment was stopped, and 4 ducks continued to show greater than 50% inhibition 12 days after stopping treatment. Duck hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid, which was measured in total cellular deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from liver biopsy specimens obtained before and on the last day of treatment with dideoxycytidine, showed an average inhibition of 96% in 3 ducks treated with dideoxycytidine, but showed no decrease in the remaining 5 ducks. Thus, dideoxycytidine has potent antiviral activity against duck hepatitis B virus and warrants further evaluation as an antiviral agent in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic, femoral, and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in 7 control subjects and 20 cirrhotic patients with ascites, 14 of them without (group A) and 6 with (group B) functional renal failure. Hyperdynamic systemic circulation, increased plasma volume, and hyperreninism were present in groups A and B. These changes were more severe in group B, which showed, as compared with group A, lower total vascular resistances and mean arterial pressure together with increased cardiac index and plasma renin activity. Significant differences in regional hemodynamics were also observed between groups. In group A, femoral and renal fractions of cardiac output were respectively increased and reduced as compared with controls. By contrast, in group B, both fractions of cardiac output were reduced when compared either with controls or with group A. In the entire patient group there was a close direct correlation between femoral and renal fractions of cardiac output (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) and both of them correlated independently with total vascular resistances (r = 0.79; p less than 0.001 in both cases). These results indicate that, in nonazotemic cirrhotics with ascites, vasodilatation in extrasplanchnic areas contributes to the genesis of the hyperdynamic circulation. The presence in group B of a reduced flow to extrasplanchnic territories, in association with an increase of the hyperdynamic circulatory status, suggests that exacerbation of splanchnic vasodilatation is involved in the development of the hepatorenal syndrome. Finally, in cirrhosis, the changes that occur in systemic hemodynamics appear to influence renal function and renal blood flow.\r"

Seven water-loaded obese (14-19 years old) and five nonobese young adults (18-21 years old) had insulin given intravenously at a rate of 40 munits/m2/min. Blood glucose and creatinine clearance were not altered by euglycemic hyperinsulinemia in either the obese or the nonobese group. Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a significant decrease in urinary sodium excretion in both groups of subjects (by 54.2 +/- 3% [mean +/- SEM] in the obese and by 50.9 +/- 3.1% in the nonobese group). However, the amount of glucose required to maintain euglycemia was significantly less in the obese versus nonobese group, 89.5 +/- 6.2 versus 329.2 +/- 16 mg glucose/m2/min (p less than 0.001). There was no relation in either group between the amount of glucose required to maintain euglycemia and the change in urinary sodium excretion. On a separate day, all of the obese subjects underwent 3 hours of water diuresis but without insulin. There was no change in urinary sodium excretion with sustained water diuresis alone. However, when compared with the nonobese group, the obese group of subjects had a significantly higher resting mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine concentration; during the insulin clamp, neither group experienced a significant change in mean arterial pressure or heart rate, and only the nonobese group experienced an increase in plasma norepinephrine. In obese subjects, we have found, despite the presence of insulin resistance to carbohydrate metabolism, that euglycemic hyperinsulinemia was associated with a normal decrease in urinary sodium excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From Sephadex G-200 column chromatography studies, a single kallikrein peak was observed in both kallikrein radioimmunoassay and kininogenase activity in all samples from normal subjects, low renin essential hypertensive and renoparenchymal hypertensive patients, and in purified kallikrein solution. The enzyme-specific activity around the kallikrein peak in all urine samples from each group was significantly lower than that in purified kallikrein, and a significantly lower specific activity was found in both patient groups than was found in normal subjects. Moreover, it was also recognized that the specific activity of kallikrein decreased in all cases with the increase of the molecular weight of kallikrein, and this tendency was observed more obviously in the low renin essential hypertensive and renoparenchymal hypertensive patients than in the normal subjects. These results suggest the presence of a kallikrein-specific inhibitor with a low molecular weight in human urine, although the possibility of a variant form of kallikrein cannot be excluded.\r"

The detection limit of the assays was between 0.5 and 1 pmol/ml. There was a good correlation (r = 0.989) between the two assays for the measurement of human plasma spiked with CGP 38 560 in concentrations from 1.9 nM to 12 microM. Intra-assay variability was 6.1-17.3% and 4.4-27.2% for the radioinhibitor binding assay and the enzyme inhibition assay, respectively. Interassay variability was 6.0-28.2% and 3.8-28.4% for the radioinhibitor binding assay and the enzyme inhibition assay, respectively. Blood samples were collected during a pharmacological study performed in normotensive human volunteers on an unrestricted diet who were infused during a 30-minute period with CGP 38 560 A (50 micrograms/kg). Similar values for the concentrations of renin inhibitor in plasma were obtained with the radioinhibitor binding assay and the enzyme inhibitor assay, and there was a significant correlation between values obtained with the two different methodologies (r = 0.94). The plasma levels of renin inhibitor reached a maximum at the end of infusion and then decreased rapidly, indicating a short plasma half-life. The changes in biochemical parameters, plasma renin activity, and plasma concentration of active renin could be related to the concentrations of CGP 38 560 measured in the plasma.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the relative importance of renal renin stores and de novo synthesis during stimulation of renin secretion and the role of transcription and posttranscriptional factors in providing increased synthesis of renin. When enalapril was administered to previously untreated mice, plasma renin concentration increased 40-fold within 1.5 hours, and remained at a high level for the 8 days of the experiment. Renal renin decreased by 82% after 24 hours and thereafter increased to levels higher than controls. Calculations of renin turnover, based on data for the rate of metabolism of renin in plasma, indicated that most of the renin released in the first 24 hours could be accounted for by the decrease in renal renin stores, indicating that de novo synthesis played only a minor role. After 24 hours, however, when both plasma renin concentration and renal renin increased, the calculated rate of renin synthesis increased to nearly 40 times the rate in controls. When enalapril was administered to mice that had been depleted of plasma and renal renin by chronic sodium loading, plasma renin concentration increased markedly within 1.5 hours, but to only half the level achieved in the previously untreated mice. No decrease in renal renin occurred, suggesting that the renal renin remaining after chronic sodium loading was not available for release. Renal renin messenger RNA increased 4.5-fold after 6 hours, and after 8 days had increased to 5.0 times the level at day 0. The increase in calculated rate of renin synthesis was maximal between 5 and 8 days, when it was 54 times greater than at day 0. During enalapril treatment, there were marked increases in the granulation of the juxtaglomerular cells and in the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus they contained. These results suggest that posttranscriptional factors play a major role in determining the rate of renin synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally agreed that sympathetic innervation of vascular tissues in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is greater than that existing in vascular tissues from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. One factor responsible for regulation of the growth of peripheral sympathetic nerves is the peptide nerve growth factor, which is released from effector cells. In the present study, an enzyme immunoassay was used to measure nerve growth factor levels in mesenteric arteries (densely innervated) and aortas (sparsely innervated) from both young (20-day-old) and mature (6-month-old) SHR and WKY rats. The nerve growth factor content of mesenteric arteries and aortas from 20-day-old SHR was significantly greater than that present in corresponding tissues from WKY rats. In contrast, the nerve growth factor content found in mesenteric arteries and aortas of adult SHR did not differ significantly from that found in the corresponding adult WKY rat tissues. Moreover, when the tissues were obtained from adult animals, nerve growth factor levels were substantially higher in mesenteric arteries compared with aortas, regardless of the rat strain. These results support the hypothesis that the greater nerve growth factor content of vascular tissues from young SHR is involved in the early increased sympathetic innervation of blood vessels in this animal model of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin, an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide, and angiotensin II were intravenously injected into the femoral vein of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats that had been anesthetized with urethane. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded from a cannula inserted into the carotid artery. All experiments were carried out after treatment with adrenergic and cholinergic antagonists. Endothelin showed a potent, dose-dependent pressor action. The dose-response relations for the increase in blood pressure of rats receiving endothelin were comparable with those of rats receiving angiotensin II. However, endothelin showed far more long-lasting effects. Endothelin-induced responses consisted of three phases: a rapid and transient depressor phase and then two phases of pressor (transient and long-lasting) response. Nicardipine (0.1 mg/kg), a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, markedly attenuated the slow phase of the pressor response but only slightly attenuated the rapid one. The pressor action of endothelin was not inhibited by continuous infusions of saralasin, which almost abolished the angiotensin II-induced pressor response. Endothelin-induced pressor response was also not attenuated by indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. These data provide evidence that endothelin produces a unique, potent, and long-lasting pressor response, which appears to be in part related to the activation of Ca2+ channels. In 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the maximal pressor response to endothelin was slightly but significantly greater than that in age-matched WKY rats, but the dose dependency of the response was approximately consistent with that in WKY rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In planning for long-duration (1- to 2-yr) space missions (microgravity), the availability of oxygen, water, and food is critical for survival. If astronauts would consume approximately 3,100 kcal and 2.2 liters of fluid per day, the requirements for a 2-yr flight would be 2,263,000 kcal and 1,606 liters for each astronaut. These estimates, based on limited microgravity simulation and flight data, include 1 h/day of moderate isotonic exercise. Each 30-min/day reduction in exercise training time would save 110,869 kcal and 91 liters of water per year. One daily 5-h extravehicular sortie at an average work rate of 1.7 l/min would require an additional 529,250 kcal and 1,095 liters of water per year. Results from microgravity simulation (bed rest) experiments suggest that 1) there is uncertainty whether basal metabolism is unchanged, 2) submaximal ergometer exercise oxygen uptake appears to be unchanged or lower, and 3) without vigorous exercise training near peak levels, the peak oxygen uptake is definitely reduced. In addition, the equilibrium level of exercise core temperature is elevated excessively by approximately 0.5 degrees C after bed-rest acclimation. Changes in the efficiency of work or metabolism in any or all of these conditions could affect nutritional requirements for long spaceflights. Further research is necessary to elucidate the metabolic factors that would be changed and the energy cost of intra- and extravehicular activity during prolonged exposure to microgravity.\r"

  ".W": "Inspiratory prolongation is an integral component of the response to added inspiratory resistance. To ascertain whether this response depends on the relation between inspiratory flow (V) and the pressure perturbation, we compared the responses when this relationship was made progressively less distinct by creating phase shifts between V and the resulting negative mouth pressure (Pm). This was done with an apparatus that altered Pm in proportion to V (J. Appl. Physiol. 62:2491-2499, 1987). V was passed through low-pass electronic filters of different frequency responses before serving as the command signal to the apparatus. In six normal subjects the average neural inspiratory duration (TI) response (delta TI) was sharply (P less than 0.01) reduced (0.32 +/- 0.07 to 0.12 +/- 0.07 s) when the filter's frequency response decreased from 7.5 to 3.0 Hz. The TI response was essentially flat between tube resistance (i.e., no lag, delta TI = 0.36 +/- 0.11 s) and the 7.5-Hz filter, and there was no further change in TI response with filters having a frequency response less than 3.0 Hz, with all TI responses in this range being not significant. Subjects could not consciously perceive a difference between various filter settings. We conclude that the TI response is critically influenced by the phase of the negative pressure wave relative to TI. Furthermore the TI responses are not deliberate, although consciousness is required for their elicitation.\r"

Eumenorrheic runners were studied in the early follicular and midluteal phases determined by urinary luteinizing hormone and progesterone and plasma estradiol and progesterone assays; amenorrheic runners were studied once. Menstrual phase was associated with no significant differences in preexercise plasma AVP or PRA, but ALDO levels were significantly higher during the midluteal phase than the early follicular phase. Plasma AVP and PRA were significantly elevated at 4 min after the 40-min run in the eumenorrheic runners during both menstrual phases and returned to preexercise levels by 40 min after exercise. Plasma ALDO responses at 4 and 40 min after exercise were higher in the midluteal phase than the early follicular phase. Menstrual status was associated with no significant differences in preexercise AVP or PRA; however, ALDO levels were significantly higher in the amenorrheic runners. After exercise, responses in the amenorrheic runners were comparable with the eumenorrheic runners during the early follicular phase. Thus, submaximal exercise elicits significant increases in plasma AVP and PRA independent of menstrual phase and status. However, plasma ALDO is significantly elevated during the midluteal phase, exercise results in a greater response during this menstrual phase, and amenorrheic runners have elevated resting levels of ALDO.\r"

However, during exercise blood glucose was lower in anemic animals (4.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.1 mM) and lactate was higher (6.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.5 mM). Blood lactate disposal rates (turnover measured with recyclable tracer, Ri) were not different at rest and averaged 136 +/- 5.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1. Ri was significantly elevated in both control (260.9 +/- 7.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and anemic animals (372.6 +/- 8.6) during exercise. Metabolic clearance rate (MCR = Ri/[lactate]) did not differ during rest (151 +/- 8.2 ml.kg-1.min-1); MCR was reduced more by exercise in anemic animals (64.3 +/- 3.8) than in controls (129.2 +/- 4.1). Plasma catecholamine levels were not different in resting rats, with pooled mean values of 0.45 +/- 0.1 and 0.48 +/- 0.1 ng/ml for epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Constant-flow ventilation (CFV) maintains alveolar ventilation without tidal excursion in dogs with normal lungs, but this ventilatory mode requires high CFV and bronchoscopic guidance for effective subcarinal placement of two inflow catheters. We designed a circuit that combines CFV with continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV; CFV-CPPV), which negates the need for bronchoscopic positioning of CFV cannula, and tested this system in seven dogs having oleic acid-induced pulmonary edema. Addition of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, 10 cmH2O) reduced venous admixture from 44 +/- 17 to 10.4 +/- 5.4% and kept arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) normal. With the innovative CFV-CPPV circuit at the same PEEP and respiratory rate (RR), we were able to reduce tidal volume (VT) from 437 +/- 28 to 184 +/- 18 ml (P less than 0.001) and elastic end-inspiratory pressures (PEI) from 25.6 +/- 4.6 to 17.7 +/- 2.8 cmH2O (P less than 0.001) without adverse effects on cardiac output or pulmonary exchange of O2 or CO2; indeed, PaCO2 remained at 35 +/- 4 Torr even though CFV was delivered above the carina and at lower (1.6 l.kg-1.min-1) flows than usually required to maintain eucapnia during CFV alone. At the same PEEP and RR, reduction of VT in the CPPV mode without CFV resulted in CO2 retention (PaCO2 59 +/- 8 Torr). We conclude that CFV-CPPV allows CFV to effectively mix alveolar and dead spaces by a small bulk flow bypassing the zone of increased resistance to gas mixing, thereby allowing reduction of the CFV rate, VT, and PEI for adequate gas exchange.\r"

  ".W": "Increased energy expenditure often occurs during illness or after injection of endotoxin and can contribute to the generation of fever. In laboratory rats and mice the thermogenic response has been attributed to the sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), although mice often fail to show pyrexia. In this study the effects of malaria on O2 consumption and BAT were studied in mice inoculated with Plasmodium berghei. Parasitemia was maximal (greater than 50% of erythrocytes showing positive Leishman staining) 72 h after inoculation. Up to this time body weight and food intake were similar to values for control mice, although colonic temperatures were slightly depressed in infected mice. Thereafter, infected mice showed marked hypophagia, loss of body weight, and severe hypothermia; colonic temperature was less than 31 degrees C at 96 h when the experiment was terminated. Resting O2 consumption (VO2) measured at 24 degrees C was slightly elevated in infected mice 12 h after inoculation and reached a peak value (31% above controls) at 48 h. VO2 returned to the same value as controls at 96 h. In vitro thermogenic activity of BAT (assessed from binding of guanosine diphosphate to isolated mitochondria) was not significantly altered in infected mice. These data demonstrate a marked thermogenic response to malarial infection, but this is not accompanied by fever in mice and is dissociated from stimulation of BAT activity.\r"

These experiments were repeated after selective DA1-blockade with SCH 23390. Twelve experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of fenoldopam on base-line hemodynamics. Sixty experiments were performed after PGF2 alpha vasoconstriction. Thirty lung preparations were pretreated with SCH 23390. PGF2 alpha was infused into the pulmonary inflow catheter at 2.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 to give a sustained rise in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (5.0 +/- 1.0 mmHg). Fenoldopam, at doses of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 micrograms/kg, was injected into the pulmonary artery (n = 5 blocked and n = 5 unblocked at each dose). Fenoldopam had no effect on hemodynamics in the absence of PGF2 alpha. In the unblocked group, after PGF2 alpha vasoconstriction, fenoldopam infusion resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure with a dose-response curve characteristic for a drug-receptor interaction [Response = -1.0 (log Dose) -1.6]. In the DA1-blocked group after PGE2 alpha vasoconstriction, the dose-response curve was shifted to the right but parallel to the unblocked group, indicating competitive receptor blockade [Response -0.8 (log Dose) -0.05]. We conclude that vasodilatory DA1-receptors are responsible for the observed results.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, four square-wave modes of pressure-preset mechanical ventilation (PPV)--pressure control, pressure support, inverse ratio, and airway pressure release ventilation--have been introduced to clinical practice. Conceptually, they share important features. Yet, because there remains widespread uncertainty regarding their ventilatory characteristics, efficacy, and appropriate use, the potential range of application is only now being investigated. To construct a unifying mathematical model of PPV, we developed a system of equations for prediction of the major \"outcome\" variables of PPV--tidal volume, minute ventilation, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure, mean alveolar pressure, and mechanical work--from the primary clinical \"inputs\" from patient (resistance, compliance) and clinician (applied pressure, frequency, inspiratory time fraction). Our analysis revealed distinct bounding limits for the outcome variables of ventilation and pressure and important implications for their clinical determinants. Although simplifying assumptions were required to enable construction of this mathematical analogue of respiratory system behavior, this model provides a firm conceptual framework for understanding the physiological interactions between PPV and the patients they are intended to help.\r"

In view of this we studied the effect of apomorphine, specific antagonists of dopamine receptors SCH 23390 (D1), sulpiride and domperidone (D2), and cis(z)-flupentixol (D1 + D2) on the typical ventilatory response to hypoxia in neonatal rabbit pups. This ventilatory response to hypoxia is characterized by an initial stimulatory (phase 1) followed by a declining (phase 2) pattern. Cis(z)-flupentixol markedly increased phase 1 and abolished phase 2. A similar effect was seen with SCH 23390. Administration of sulpiride or domperidone increased phase 1 but did not affect phase 2, thereby not altering the biphasic pattern of ventilation to hypoxia. The abolition of the biphasic response in neonatal pups on decerebration was also found to be restored by topical application of apomorphine in the fourth ventricle. Our results suggest that dopamine is acting centrally in mediating the declining phase of the biphasic response to hypoxia in rabbit pups possibly via the D1-receptors.\r"

Mucosal blood flow is influenced by vascular and airway pressures, inspired air conditions, and autonomic neurotransmitters. Several inflammatory mediators and neuropeptides are capable of enhancing the permeability for macromolecules in postcapillary venules and of augmenting tissue water volume, often with a concomitant increase in perfusion. These microvascular responses of the lower airway mucosa have an important role under various conditions of physiological stress and in airway inflammation.\r"

The airway defensive reflexes were induced by instillation into the trachea of 0.5 ml of distilled water at two different levels of end-expiratory pressure (0 and 10 cmH2O CPAP). The tracheal irritation at an end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O caused a variety of reflex responses including apnea, spasmodic panting, expiration reflex, cough reflex, an increase in heart rate, and an increase in blood pressure. Lung inflation during CPAP of 10 cmH2O did not exert any influence on these reflex responses in terms of the types, latencies, and durations of reflex responses although the intensity of the expiration reflex and cough reflex was augmented by lung inflation. Our results suggest that the pulmonary stretch receptors do not play an important role in the mechanisms of airway defensive reflexes in humans.\r"

  ".U": "90008609\r", 
  ".W": "Assessing diaphragmatic contractility is a common goal in various situations. This assessment is mainly based on static or dynamic maximal voluntary maneuvers and twitch transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) obtained by stimulation of the phrenic nerves (PS). PS eliminates the central components of diaphragmatic activation, but the available techniques of PS remain subject to some limitations. Transcutaneous PS is painful, and needle PS is potentially dangerous. Time-varying magnetic fields can stimulate nervous structures without pain and without adverse effects. In six subjects, we have studied cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS) as a method of PS. We have compared the stimulated Pdi (Pdistim) with the maximal Pdi obtained during static combined expulsive-Mueller maneuver (Pdimax) and with the Pdi generated during a sniff test (Pdisniff). CMS produced twitch Pdi averaging 33.4 +/- 9.7 cmH2O. Pdistim/Pdimax and Pdistim/Pdisniff were 24 +/- 6 and 41 +/- 14%, respectively. These values are comparable to those obtained in other studies with transcutaneous PS. They were highly reproducible in all the subjects. Electromyographic data provided evidence of bilateral maximal stimulation. CMS is a nonspecific method and may stimulate various nervous structures. However, diaphragmatic contraction was elicited by stimulation of the phrenic trunk, since the phrenicodiaphragmatic latencies (less than 7 ms) were in the range of values reported with direct stimulation of the trunk. Cocontraction of neck muscles, including the sternomastoid, was present, but its influence in the CMS-induced Pdi seems minimal. We conclude that magnetic stimulation is an easy, well-tolerated, reproducible safe, and valuable method to assess phrenic conduction and diaphragmatic twitch response.\r"

The electrophysiological and the mechanical responses to DPS were compared with those with phrenic nerve stimulation. In four animals, evaluation of the electromyogram before and after curare demonstrated that plate electrode stimulation occurred via the phrenic nerve filaments. In four animals, similar transdiaphragmatic pressure was produced at maximal current with DPS and phrenic nerve stimulation. Using DPS increasing current beyond a certain level resulted in recruitment of muscles besides the diaphragm. In six animals, an external abdominal pressure of 15 cmH2O produced maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure, suggesting that the diaphragm was contracting near optimal position with this external abdominal pressure. In another four animals the twitch and pressure-frequency characteristics with the use of DPS were found to be reproducible over a 2-h period. We conclude that DPS is an effective method of diaphragmatic stimulation and should prove to be a valuable technique to study the diaphragm in long-term studies of small rodents.\r"

First, diaphragmatic thickness was measured in situ at necropsy with ultrasound and verified by measuring the same resected segment of diaphragm by ruler (correlation coefficient = 0.93, slope = 0.97). The technique of imaging the diaphragm in living subjects was developed by using a 15-MHz transducer coupled to an M-mode echocardiograph. Ten normal male volunteers were studied while sitting. The ultrasound transducer was held between the ribs in the ninth lateral interspace, and tidal volume was measured by spirometry. The thickening fraction (TF) was calculated as TF = (thickness at peak inspiration - thickness at end expiration)/thickness at end expiration for each of a series of different sized breaths. The function, TF vs. lung volume, for a range of volumes was linear for each subject and had intrasubject reproducibility with intersubject variability. We conclude that diaphragmatic TF is related to function as determined by lung volume, and this may prove to be a useful technique for in vivo studies of diaphragmatic function.\r"

A pair of collimated coincidence gamma photon detectors was used to monitor the accumulation of tracer in the tissue after 2-[18F]FDG injection. Time-activity curves were generated on a second-by-second basis under control conditions, during increased contractile activity, or hyperinsulinemia. The arterial input of 2-[18F]FDG, plasma glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, and insulin were determined. A graphical (Patlak plot) procedure was used to determine the fractional rate of tracer phosphorylation and therefore trapping in the muscle. From the graphical analysis, the estimated rate of glucose phosphorylation (R) in the unperturbed state was calculated to be 0.037 mumol.min-1.ml-1 of tissue. During perturbation by electrical stimulation, an increase in the rate of tracer phosphorylation (K) was observed. No change in the rate of tracer phosphorylation was observed during hyperinsulinemia. The results support the use of 2-[18F]FDG and the graphical procedure for the noninvasive assessment of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in vivo. The method described is sensitive to changes in the rate of tracer uptake with respect to time and physiological interventions.\r"

Direct stimuli used supramaximal current density, 0.2-ms pulses, and 250-ms tetanic trains. Theophylline (500 mg/ml) increased force development at low stimulation frequencies but did not increase maximal force [25.7 +/- 0.5 for theophylline vs. 26.0 +/- 0.4 (SE) N/cm2 for control (n = 34)]. During repeated submaximal (25-36 Hz) tetanic contractions, theophylline did not affect endurance. During repeated maximal (160 Hz) tetanic contractions theophylline reduced endurance, accelerating the fall of developed force. Theophylline also inhibited recovery of force after endurance trials ended. We conclude that theophylline does not increase maximal tetanic force and can reduce diaphragm endurance in vitro.\r"

The second group of patients underwent treatment with perioperative polymyxin B given in conjunction with an excisional procedure of the burn wound. In this group, polymyxin B also accomplished a reduction in endotoxemia from preoperative to postoperative cases, but there was no significant reduction in clinical complication rate or mortality.

Normal levels of functioning leukocytes are essential to the host's ability to resist infection. This study examined alterations in murine granulopoiesis after the inducement of a standardized, sublethal, third-degree burn covering 10%, 20%, or 30% of the dorsal body surface area. Significant alterations arose in peripheral leukocyte concentrations after inducement of uncomplicated thermal injury. In general, within the first day of injury, all three trauma levels produced a peripheral leukocytosis that lasted for 35 days or more. The leukocytoses that followed 20% and 30% injuries were similar and in numerous respects paralleled previously reported human peripheral responses after similar levels of thermal trauma. Differential examinations of peripheral blood demonstrated the peripheral leukocytosis to be due primarily to the influx of morphologically mature-appearing polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Premature bone marrow release did not appear to be a factor as immature polymorphonuclear neutrophils were seldom greater than 2% of polymorphonuclear neutrophil totals. Bone marrow granulopoietic activity was examined by in vitro clonal cell culture techniques and assessed over a period of 35 days after injury. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC), indicative of marrow progenitor cell concentrations, were significantly increased for 28 to 35 days after 10% injury and 11 to 14 days after 20% or 30% injury. Normal or increased progenitor cell concentrations and a lack of morphologically appearing premature forms suggest that the leukocytosis is the result of injury-induced alteration(s) in polymorphonuclear neutrophil margination or release mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an 18-month period we have recognized and treated five patients with burn injuries who had acute cholecystitis. They ranged in age from 13 to 40 years. Four of the five patients had positive blood cultures and all five patients had positive bile cultures. The diagnosis was made on the basis of unexplained sepsis and an abnormal sonogram or hepatobiliary scan. Four patients underwent cholecystectomy and one patient underwent a cholecystostomy. Four patients survived and were discharged from the hospital. All five patients were receiving nutritional support. Factors such as prolonged fasting, dehydration, narcotic administration, and sepsis have been suggested as contributing factors in the development of acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is a serious complication in such patients and must be considered and treated promptly. Serial ultrasound studies have been helpful in managing patients suspected of having acute septic cholecystitis.\r"

  ".W": "Anesthesia, surgery, and hypothermia are conventionally considered the major stress factors in the metabolic and hormonal responses to cardiac surgery. We compared these responses in 14 nondiabetics during and for 24 h after coronary artery bypass surgery; 8 received cardioplegic solutions (C+), and 6 did not (C-). The mean intraoperative glucose load in C+ was 106 g compared to 32 g in C-; postoperatively both groups received 50 g. Marked hyperglycemia (31.8 +/- 4.8 mmol/L) occurred during hypothermia in C+, but dropped to 18.9 mmol/L before surgery ended and to 11.2 +/- 1.1 mmol/L by 2 h postop. In contrast, C- showed constant mild hyperglycemia of 8.3-9.8 mmol/L throughout, significantly less than C+ until 1 h postop. Insulin was suppressed by 55% only during hypothermia, peaking with rewarming in C+ at 2,849 +/- 911 vs. 639 +/- 251 pmol/L in C- (P less than 0.05); as with glycemia, values were comparable after 2 h postop. The pancreatic beta-cell thus responded to hyperglycemia during restoration of normothermia, resulting in a rapid decline in glycemia. This occurred despite elevations in antiinsulin factors in both groups; GH was 14 +/- 4 micrograms/L, cortisol was 607 +/- 38.6 nmol/L, norepinephrine was 11.5 +/- 3.7 nmol/L, epinephrine was 13,863 +/- 3,875 pmol/L, and FFA were 0.36 +/- 0.05 g/L. Early postop, a secondary rise in stress hormones occurred in both groups. Maximal cortisol values were at 4 h (1,186 +/- 140 nmol/L) and peaks of norepinephrine (6.50 +/- 1.66 nmol/L), epinephrine (7,969 +/- 3,602 pmol/L), and FFA (0.27 +/- 0.03 g/L) occurred. The only significant glucagon elevation was at 24 h (C+, 464 +/- 53 ng/L; C-, 350 +/- 241 ng/L; P less than 0.02), Thus, 1) many metabolic responses during coronary artery bypass surgery are influenced by the glucose-containing cardioplegic solution; 2) hypothermia suppresses insulin secretion, but it responds thereafter despite marked elevations of catecholamines, and is associated with decreasing glycemia despite elevated antiinsulin factors; 3) a lesser but highly significant stress response corresponds to awakening from anesthesia; and 4) glucagon plays a minor role in intraoperative hyperglycemia; the rise at 24 h is unexplained.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated a progressive decline in serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels in women during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. To determine whether this fall in serum DHEA-S levels might have been due to insulin-stimulated 1) hydrolysis of DHEA-S to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 2) conversion of DHEA-S/DHEA to androstenedione, and/or 3) urinary excretion of these steroids, 10 additional men were studied by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Each man received a 0.1 U/kg (0.72 nmol/kg) insulin bolus dose, followed by a 10 mU/kg.min (72 pmol/kg.min) insulin infusion for 4 h. An average insulin level of 12,390 +/- 259 (+/- SE) pmol/L (1,726.8 +/- 36 microU/mL) was achieved; serum glucose was maintained at 5.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/L (90.5 +/- 2.3 mg/dL). During the hyperinsulinemia, serum DHEA-S levels fell progressively and were significantly lower than baseline at 4 and 6 h of study (85.5 +/- 5.9% and 79.1 +/- 3.2% of baseline values, respectively; P less than 0.05). Serum DHEA levels fell concurrently and were significantly lower than baseline at 2, 4, and 6 h of study (66.2 +/- 12.3%, 61.6 +/- 11.2%, and 52.9 +/- 10.2% of baseline values, respectively; P less than 0.05). The percent fall in serum DHEA levels correlated positively with the percent fall in serum DHEA-S levels (r = 0.44; P less than 0.02). Serum androstenedione levels also fell progressively during hyperinsulinemia and were significantly lower than baseline at 2, 4, and 6 h of study (71.5 +/- 4.1%, 71.0 +/- 7.2%, and 48.1 +/- 3.3% of baseline values, respectively; P less than 0.05). No change in serum DHEA-S, DHEA, or androstenedione levels occurred in paired control studies, during which 0.45% saline was infused at rates matched exactly to the rates of the dextrose and insulin infusions during the hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. Despite decreasing serum DHEA-S and DHEA levels during hyperinsulinemia, urinary DHEA-S and DHEA glucuronide excretions were increased by 50% (P less than 0.05) and 86% (P = 0.05), respectively, compared to urinary excretion of these steroids during control studies. In contrast, urinary excretion of unconjugated DHEA was unchanged. Quantitatively, however, increased urinary excretion of conjugated DHEA during hyperinsulinemia accounted for only about 5% of the concomitant fall in serum DHEA-S concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Plasma C-peptide and insulin levels achieved during infusions of five doses of arginine (30 min) with and without a 60-min hyperglycemic clamp (17 mmol/L) were analyzed using a modified Michaelis-Menten equation. At euglycemia, the ED50 (half-maximally stimulating serum arginine concentration) was significantly less for first phase than for second phase plasma C-peptide secretion (0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; P less than 0.002). Hyperglycemia significantly increased arginine-induced insulin secretion at all arginine infusion rates (P less than 0.01) without significantly altering the ED50 for either phase. We conclude 1) that the regulation of arginine-induced insulin secretion differs between both phases of insulin secretion, and 2) that a 1-h infusion with glucose significantly potentiates arginine-induced insulin secretion without influencing the difference in regulation of both phases of arginine-induced insulin secretion, supporting the validity of the use of arginine as a secretagogue in studies involving hyperglycemia.\r"

We have measured serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free and bound fractions of estrogens and androgens, and gonadotropins in 20 consecutive postmenopausal insulin-treated diabetic women and 16 normal postmenopausal women. The diabetics were nonketoacidotic, without nephropathy and without proliferative retinopathy. The groups were comparable regarding age and percent ideal body weight. The diabetic group had significantly increased serum levels of estrone (P less than 0.001), estrone sulfate (P less than 0.05), 17 beta-estradiol (P less than 0.02), and SHBG (P less than 0.001). Levels of testosterone, delta 4-androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate tended to be higher (not significantly) in the diabetics. FSH and LH levels were similar in the two groups, while serum PRL was significantly lower in the diabetic group (P less than 0.02). The hormonal changes in the diabetics were not related to control of the diabetes. We conclude that total estrogen levels are increased in postmenopausal women with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus. High SHBG levels in these patients tend to keep the free fractions of sex hormones within normal limits.\r"

A blocking immunofluorescence test using these MAbs, designated 5A, 5E, and 10D, revealed that 5A and 5E recognized the same or a closely associated epitope, but the epitope for 10D was completely different, 18 of 30 BP sera blocked the reactivity of 10D MAb and 17 sera blocked 5E, while 9 sera did not block the staining of either antibody. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that both 5A and 5E MAbs reacted exclusively with a protein band of approximately 230 kD in normal human epidermal extracts. However, 10D did not show any protein band. 22 of 30 BP sera strongly reacted with the same 230-kD protein, while none of control sera showed such reactivity. These results clearly demonstrated the heterogeneity of anti-BMZ antibodies in terms of epitopes. These MAbs should be useful in future investigations concerning not only the immunopathology but also the biochemial and molecular analyses of the BP antigen.\r"

During euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (n = 7) at 44 mU.liter-1, m-LPLA in non-exercised muscle decreased from 30 +/- 7.4 mU.g-1 wet weight (w.w.) (mean +/- SE) to 19 +/- 3.3 (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, the decrease in m-LPLA correlated closely (r = 0.97, P less than 0.05) with the increase in leg glucose uptake. Moreover, basal m-LPLA correlated with the insulin-induced increase in leg glucose uptake (r = 0.93, P less than 0.05). In the control group (n = 6) in which saline was infused in place of insulin and glucose, m-LPLA in nonexercised muscle did not change with time. No change in m-LPLA was observed immediately after one-legged knee extension exercise, but 4 h after exercise m-LPLA was higher (P less than 0.05) in the exercised thigh (47 +/- 17.8 mU.g-1 w.w.) compared with the contralateral nonexercised thigh (29 +/- 6.3 mU.g-1 w.w.). This difference was not found 8 h after exercise. The triacylglycerol content of serum lipoproteins decreased during insulin infusion. It is concluded that in contrast to the effect on adipose tissue, physiological concentrations of insulin decrease m-LPLA in proportion to the effect of insulin on muscle glucose uptake, while muscle contractions cause a local, delayed, and transient increase in m-LPLA. Further-more, basal m-LPLA is an indicator of muscle insulin sensitivity.\r"

We used synthetic peptides to identify antibodies in sera of myasthenia gravis patients reactive with the human acetylcholine receptor (HuAChR) alpha-subunit, residues 160-167. Affinity purification of these antibodies, using the HuAChR alpha-subunit 157-170 peptide immobilized on thiopropyl-Sepharose, yielded IgG antibodies that bound to the native AChR and inhibited the binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to the receptor. The HuAChR alpha-subunit 160-167 peptide demonstrated specific immunological cross-reactivity with a shared homologous domain on herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, residues 286-293, by both binding and inhibition studies. Thus, HuAChR alpha-subunit, residues 160-167, elicits antibodies in myasthenic patients that binds to the native AChR protein and is capable of eliciting a biologic effect. Immunologic cross-reactivity of this \"self\" epitope with herpes simplex virus suggest that this virus may be associated with the initiation of some cases of myasthenia.\r"

Tryptase is the major neutral protease present in human mast cells and serves as a specific marker of mast cells by immunohistologic techniques and as a specific indicator of mast cell activation when detected in biologic fluids. Based on nucleic acid sequence, human tryptase consists of a 244-amino acid catalytic portion of 27,423 D with two putative N-linked carbohydrate binding sites and a 30-amino acid leader sequence of 3,048 D. A His74, Asp120, Ser223 catalytic triad and four cystine groups were identified by analogy to other serine proteases. Regions of amino acid sequence that are highly conserved in serine proteases, in general, were conserved in tryptase. The catalytic portion of human tryptase had an 84% amino acid sequence similarity with that of dog tryptase; their leader sequences had a 67% similarity. Asp217 in the substrate binding pocket of human tryptase is consistent with a specificity for Arg and Lys residues at the site of cleavage (P1), whereas Glu245 is consistent with the known preference of human tryptase for substrates with Arg or Lys also at P3, analogous residues also being present in dog tryptase. Asp244, which is substituted for the Gly found in dog tryptase and in most serine proteases, is present in the putative substrate binding pocket and may confer additional substrate specificity on human tryptase for basic residues. Further studies now can be designed to elucidate these structure-function relationships.\r"

Blockage for 3-7 h caused a rapid and significant rise in serum amylase activity and an increase in amylase activity within the pancreas. The concentration of lysosomal enzymes in the pancreas was not altered but they became redistributed among subcellular fractions and, as a result, an increased amount was recovered in the 1,000-g, 15-min pellet, which was enriched in zymogen granules. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that lysosomal enzymes become localized within organelles which, in size and distribution, resemble zymogen granules. They also contain digestive enzyme zymogens. Blockage of pancreatic secretions also caused lysosomal enzyme-containing organelles to become more fragile and subject to in vitro rupture. These changes noted after short-term pancreatic duct obstruction are remarkably similar to those previously noted to occur during the early stages of diet and secretagogue-induced experimental pancreatitis, observations that have suggested that colocalization of digestive enzyme zymogens and lysosomal hydrolases might result in intracellular digestive enzyme activation and be an important early event in the evolution of those forms of experimental acute pancreatitis.\r"

To define possible mechanisms for this growth arrest, we determined the effects of ethanol on EGF binding and EGF receptor (EGF-R) levels. During a 24-h exposure to ethanol (1.7 mg/ml, 31 mM), cell replication was completely blocked while EGF binding per cell doubled. This effect was no specific for EGF, with variable degrees of increased binding noted for insulin, transferrin, and glucagon. Significantly increased EGF binding was seen after 6 h of ethanol exposure, and both growth arrest and enhanced EGF binding were reversed within 12 h of ethanol withdrawal. Increases in both \"high\" and \"low\" affinity sites were seen, with no changes in the apparent Kd's. Total RNA, beta-actin mRNA, and EGF-R mRNA were increased 50-70% in ethanol exposed cells. However, direct measurements of EGF-R synthesis rates by [35S]methionine incorporation revealed no differences between control and ethanol exposed cells. Internalization of EGF-R was significantly altered by ethanol exposure. A 2-h incubation resulted in the internalization of 57% of the ligand in control cells, while only 31% of bound EGF was internalized in the ethanol exposed cells. Thus, the enhanced EGF binding may be due to decreased efficiency of internalization.\r"

To study the origin of alpha-granule Fg, platelet-associated Fg was measured by ELISA and Western blotting, and localized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy in a patient with symptomatic congenital afibrinogenemia before and after replacement therapy with cryoprecipitate. alpha-Granule Fg was detected in the majority of platelets as early as 24 h postinfusion, suggesting that direct platelet uptake was occurring. Platelet Fg reached a maximum value of 42.5% of normal values at 3 d postinfusion and was localized in the alpha-granules, while plasma levels followed a typical half-life profile. Significant alpha-granule Fg was still detectable at 13 d postinfusion, with plasma Fg virtually absent. Studies on cultured CFU-MKs from the patient also confirmed that MKs can incorporate exogeneous Fg into alpha-granules. These results indicate that platelet alpha-granule Fg can be derived from the circulating plasma pool and that Fg uptake can occur in both platelets and MKs.\r"

  ".W": "An immunohistological method (Shintaku-Said method) for the demonstration of oestrogen receptors in routinely processed paraffin wax embedded tissue was applied to 19 cases of mucinous carcinoma of the breast. Seventeen (89%) tumours showed variable degrees of positivity and two were negative. In eight cases the receptors were also assayed biochemically using a dextran-coated charcoal method, and the results of the two methods showed good correlation. No difference in the distribution of positive and negative cases was noted between pure and mixed mucinous tumours, and in the latter group the pattern of staining of the mucinous elements was similar to that seen in the solid elements. It is concluded that the major advantage of this method is its ability to offer for study the distribution of the receptors in individual cells and specific histological structures. The results also indicate that most mucinous carcinomas of the breast are oestrogen receptor positive, irrespective of whether they are pure or mixed type.\r"

Fine needle aspiration was more sensitive for detecting malignancy than clinical assessment alone, the sensitivity increasing with the experience of the aspirator. The results compared favourably with those in reported series from specialist centres in the United Kingdom. The value of fine needle aspiration extends to the overall management of patients with breast masses but the results must be assessed in conjunction with the clinical context in view of the possibility of false negative or, more rarely, false positive cytological diagnoses.\r"

Eight patients with faecal E coli 0157:H7 gave a strong antibody response to 0157 LPS, shown by immunoblotting and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Six symptomatic patients without evidence of faecal VTEC also gave a strong antibody response to 0157 LPS. Sera from the remaining five patients and five healthy controls did not contain antibodies to E coli 0157. The results suggest that the testing of sera from patients with haemorrhagic colitis or haemolytic uraemic syndrome by ELISA or immunoblot would prove valuable in addition to the established procedures for detecting VTEC, using DNA probes and testing for faecal Vero cytotoxin.\r"

The tissue, once dragged toward the closure point by fascial movement, may often be stretched a further distance. Only the tension caused by stretching affects the vascular viability of the skin. This tension-alleviating maneuver may permit closure of wounds that might otherwise be subject to ischemic complications if only standard cutaneous and subcutaneous closures are employed.\r"

It began 40 years ago with the demonstration that the injection into patients of a partially purified activator of the native plasminogen-plasmin enzyme system was capable of dissolving clotted blood and fibrinous loculations in the chest. However, the application of this form of therapy for the dissolution of intravascular thrombi had to await a series of further developments, including extensive purification of the thrombolytic agents, evidence that plasminogen activators would be more appropriate than plasmin for thrombolysis and proof, first in animals and then in humans, that thrombi could be dissolved by the systemic administration of plasminogen activators. The first study of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction was reported in 1958. However, despite many studies conducted during the next 20 years, with encouraging reductions in mortality, thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction became established only when angiography provided visual evidence of the presence of a thrombus obstructing an infarct-related artery and of the achievement of prompt lysis with the administration of thrombolytic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets interact with the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in the maintenance of hemostasis. However, these physiologic mechanisms may become pathologic, requiring prevention and treatment. In this review, the following clinical developments are analyzed: 1) the role of platelets in thrombogenesis; 2) the pharmacology of platelet inhibitory agents; and, most important, 3) the results of recent randomized trials of platelet inhibitor agents in different cardiovascular disorders. Aspirin reduces mortality and infarction rates in unstable angina and significantly decreases vascular mortality in acute myocardial infarction. Platelet inhibitors decrease mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events in the chronic phase after myocardial infarction. They also decrease vein graft occlusion rates after coronary bypass surgery. Although platelet inhibitors are beneficial in preventing acute vessel occlusion during coronary angioplasty, they are ineffective in preventing chronic restenosis. Antiplatelet agents, combined with warfarin, reduce thromboembolic events in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. Platelet inhibitors are also effective in secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Finally, the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is still evolving, particularly in individuals at high risk. In conclusion, platelet inhibitors are effective in patients with a variety of cardiovascular disorders. The best studied, most inexpensive and least toxic agent is aspirin at a daily dose of 160 to 325 mg. Studies using new platelet inhibitor agents with different mechanisms of action are currently underway.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy for the removal of intravascular thrombi was introduced when streptokinase was first given to humans 40 years ago, the same year the American College of Cardiology was founded. Streptokinase was first administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction in 1959. Today, thrombolytic therapy has been established to offer significant benefits to patients with acute myocardial infarction provided they are brought to medical attention early enough after the onset of symptoms. The two major agents, streptokinase and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), have been shown to result in reperfusion of infarct-related arteries, to salvage ischemic myocardium, to improve myocardial performance and to reduce mortality. In spite of these impressive gains, this novel therapy has shortcomings. The interval from the start of thrombolytic treatment to coronary reperfusion varies significantly from patient to patient and may, at times, be too long to produce a real benefit in terms of salvage of ischemic myocardium. The rate of reocclusion lies somewhere between 10% and 20% and appears not to be influenced by concomitant heparin anticoagulation. The rate of bleeding complications even with the \"fibrin-specific\" rt-PA is higher than anticipated and may range from 10% to 30%. As a consequence, intensive efforts are being directed at the development of improved thrombolytic agents and for adjunctive therapy evaluating better anticoagulants than heparin and better antiplatelet agents than aspirin. This review is a status report summarizing where we are in thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, where we need to improve treatment results and what is being done mainly at the preclinical level to bring about such improvements.\r"

The system consists of a single element transducer, rotated with a motor mounted on an 8F catheter tip. Cross sections obtained with ultrasound were matched with the corresponding histologic sections. The arterial specimens were histologically classified as of the muscular or elastic type. Muscular arteries interrogated with ultrasound presented with a hypoechoic media, coinciding with the smooth muscle cells. In contrast, the media of an elastic artery densely packed with elastin fibers was as echogenic as the intima and the adventitia. On the basis of the cross-sectional image, it was possible to determine the nature of the atherosclerotic plaque. The location and thickness of the lesion measured from the histologic sections correlated well with the data derived from the corresponding ultrasound images. This study indicates that characterization of the type of artery and detection of arterial wall disease are possible with use of an intravascular ultrasound imaging technique.\r"

Variables used to investigate bilateral forearm vascular function included forearm blood flow and resistance measured by strain gauge plethysmography under rest conditions, in response to 30 s of static handgrip exercise at 40% maximal voluntary contraction and in response to 10 min of forearm arterial occlusion (that is, the reactive hyperemic blood flow response). Forearm growth was ascertained by measuring right and left forearm volumes, lengths, circumferences and skinfold thickness. Mean arterial pressure at rest in the right and left arms differed by 9% (right 78.2 +/- 2.1, left 71.0 +/- 2.7 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Forearm blood flow, however, was not significantly different between the surgically altered left arm and the normal right arm under any of the study conditions. Likewise, forearm vascular resistance was not statistically different under any conditions, although the left arm tended to have a lower resistance at rest (right 23.5 +/- 3.2, left 18.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg.min.100 ml/ml; p = 0.057). Left forearm anthropometric measurements showed a 9% reduction in volume and a 3% reduction in circumference and length. In addition, skinfold thickness tended to be larger on the left arm, suggesting that this limb had a smaller muscle mass. In conclusion, early repair with a subclavian flap does not impair vascular function in the altered limb and is associated with only minor reductions in forearm growth variables. Hence, left subclavian flap aortoplasty appears to be a safe and effective procedure for repair of coarctation of the aorta.\r"

HMW-GOID and unfractionated allergoid (GOID) had a similar allergenic activity assessed by RAST inhibition, but the HMW-GOID preparation was 65 times less reactive when it was tested by skin prick test than the GOID preparation. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in grass pollen-allergic patients with placebo (14 patients), GOID (15 patients), and HMW-GOID (13 patients). An additional group of 18 patients was treated by a rush schedule with a standardized orchard grass-pollen extract. A similar mean cumulative dose was administered with both allergoids. The fractionated allergoid only elicited minor systemic reactions similar to reactions elicited by placebo, whereas 20% of patients treated by GOID and 5.5% of patients receiving the standardized extract had a severe systemic reaction. For rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, the HMW-GOID and the standardized extract had a similar efficacy, significantly greater than placebo. GOID was less effective than the other two active treatments but was significantly more effective than placebo treatment for asthma and conjunctivitis.\r"

  ".W": "In 1981 Paul Imbach first reported the usefulness of intravenous immune globulin infusions in the treatment of children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Other studies have shown that intravenous immune globulin was associated with the fastest platelet increase of any therapy, confirming the initial observation in children and adults. We and other investigators have used intravenous immune globulin as a maintenance therapy and speculated that repeated single infusions might have a curative value, in addition to an acute effect. The best-defined mechanism of intravenous immune globulin in this model autoimmune disease is Fc receptor blockade. This was first demonstrated by a slowing of antibody-coated, chromium-labeled red blood cell survival. Subsequent confirmation has come from the use of intravenous anti-D and a monoclonal anti-FcRIII that has been used in patients refractory to treatment. In vitro studies have demonstrated alteration in Fc receptor expression on circulating cells, and this mechanism is presumed to be related intimately to the acute platelet increase seen after intravenous immune globulin. Studies with the latest platelet antibody methodology do not support interference with binding of antiplatelet antibodies as an important mechanism, but there are in vitro data to support this hypothesis. Another leading hypothesis is that intravenous immune globulin decreases the production of autoantibodies. Clinically, this has been suspected in immune thrombocytopenic purpura in which there are apparent improvements in patients with chronic disease, but no controlled studies have been performed to verify this. In acquired hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease, however, it seems quite clear that there is direct neutralization of autoanti-factor VIII antibodies by intravenous immune globulin by a presumed Fab-mediated anti-idiotype mechanism. This hypothesis has appeal and has been postulated on the basis of in vitro studies, as well as looking directly at the B cell. Another study supporting this mechanism showed that intravenous immune globulin preparations with altered Fc portions still mediate some platelet increase, even if not as much as intact IgG molecules. It remains unclear whether any effects that are the result of a lower level of autoantibody could be mediated through T cells or macrophages, rather than having direct action on the B cell. In any event, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that decreased levels of autoantibody lead to intermediate (weeks) and long-term (months to years) responses after intravenous immune globulin treatment.\r"

Infected rats received either immunoglobulin (2 gm/kg) intraperitoneally, penicillin G (dosage varied), or a combination of the two. All animals that received immunoglobulin alone died. The mortality rate of animals treated with penicillin G alone was 51%. In contrast, therapy with combined penicillin G and immunoglobulin resulted in a significantly greater mortality rate (88%). Similar detrimental effects were also observed when human immunoglobulin (2 gm/kg) was given in conjunction with ceftriaxone (mortality rates of 95.7% for ceftriaxone and immunoglobulin versus 56.5% for ceftriaxone alone). However, a smaller dose of immunoglobulin (0.5 gm/kg) did not result in the greater mortality rate. Moreover, antibiotic-mediated bacterial killing was impaired in vitro and in vivo by a large dose of immunoglobulin but not by a smaller dose. These findings suggest that large doses of human immunoglobulin may be disadvantageous to the bacterial activity of penicillin G and ceftriaxone against group B streptococcal disease. Additional studies are needed to elucidate further the mechanisms responsible for this dose-dependent adverse effect of human immunoglobulins.\r"

  ".W": "Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness of infancy and early childhood. Fifteen percent to 25% of children afflicted with Kawasaki disease develop coronary artery aneurysms. The acute phase of Kawasaki disease is characterized by a deficiency of suppressor T cells and the marked activation of T cells, B cells, and monocytes associated with increased secretion of cytokines by these immune effector cells. Evidence that this immune activation contributes to vascular endothelial cell damage in Kawasaki disease is supported by the observation that patients in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease have circulating antibodies lytic for vascular endothelial cells activated with gamma-interferon, IL-1, or tumor necrosis factor. In contrast, sera from these patients do not lyse unstimulated endothelial cells. High-dose intravenous immune globulin treatment is effective in preventing the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease. Patients treated with intravenous immune globulin have a significant increase in T suppressor cells, a decrease in circulating T helper cells, and a decrease in spontaneous IgG and IgM synthesis. These observations suggest that intravenous immune globulin reduces the vasculitis in Kawasaki disease by suppressing the marked immune activation associated with this disease.\r"

A number of defects in the neonate's host defense system have been described, including deficiency of opsonic antibodies, abnormalities in the number and function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and depressed levels of the major complement components. Experimental animal studies in our laboratory have indicated that many of these defects can be overcome through the administration of intravenous immune globulin. Recently several investigators have attempted to treat or prevent bacterial infections in human neonates with intravenous immune globulin. We have found that doses as high as 750 mg/kg can be administered to premature infants without detectable side effects. This results in IgG levels comparable with those in term infants and adults. Limited studies in the literature suggest that intravenous immune globulin therapy may decrease morbidity and mortality from infection in premature human infants. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment of preterm infants may serve to prevent the development of infection in some instances. Optimal management of preterm and some term human infants may involve immunotherapy with intravenous immune globulin.\r"

The major target cells for infection are CD4 antigen-bearing cells, which include predominantly, but not exclusively, the helper T cell subset and the monocyte-macrophage cell system. Hypergammaglobulinemia is a common and early feature of human immunodeficiency viral infection but is often associated with an inability to mount specific antibody responses to neoantigens and decreased in vitro B cell differentiation responses. On the basis of our data and reports of others, a major component of B cell hyperactivity is related to the direct activity of the human immunodeficiency virus and its proteins. We and others have documented that B cells of these patients lose the capacity to respond to both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent stimuli in vitro. Thus the human immunodeficiency virus can profoundly influence B cells, causing both \"stimulation\" (vis-a-vis hypergammaglobulinemia) and \"suppression\" (poor specific antibody responses). However, the memory cells are probably not suppressed, and their dysfunction may be directly related to the extent of helper cell dysfunction. This explanation lends itself well to the clinical observation that children (who have not developed memory to recall antigens) with human immunodeficiency viral infection have more profound defects in specific antibody responses than do adults (who have an existing pool of memory cells). Thus the main rationale for intravenous immune globulin in acquired immune deficiency syndrome is to provide antibody replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse, may adversely affect food intake and nutritional status. The drugs used to treat those disorders similarly have effects on appetite and gastrointestinal function and interact with food and nutrients. Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) cause dry mouth, constipation, and weight gain. Lithium may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, polydipsia, and weight gain. MAOIs have well-known interactions with foods containing tyramine. Lithium interacts with dietary sodium and caffeine; decreasing dietary intakes of those substances may produce lithium toxicity. Despite claims to the contrary, major psychiatric illnesses cannot be cured by nutritional therapies alone. Dietitians can, however, play an important role as part of a multidisciplinary team in the treatment of patients with psychiatric illness. Such a role includes nutrition assessment and monitoring, nutrition interventions, patient and staff education, and some forms of psychotherapy, including supportive and behavioral therapies for patients with eating disorders.\r"

Seven healthy subjects living in a long-term care facility, with a mean age of 85 and normal to borderline-hypertensive blood pressures, completed a 16-week protocol. During the double-blind cycles, subjects consumed either a low sodium (43 mmol/day) or a high sodium diet (175 mmol/day) for four weeks supplemented with placebo or salt capsules, with crossover to the other diet. Sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during the low sodium diet (69.86 mmHg +/- 3.80 vs 78.71 mmHg +/- 3.99, P less than .01), with all subjects showing decreases. Supine plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were significantly lower during the high sodium diet. Both low and high sodium diets were well-tolerated by subjects. Symptomatic postural hypotension and hyponatremia were not observed. We conclude that old-old subjects with borderline hypertension demonstrate salt-dependent increases in blood pressure. Without additional supportive studies, however, these results should not be generalized to any specific cohort of elderly individuals.\r"

Neither showed a therapeutic benefit on symptoms. The difficulties encountered in conducting such studies and the methods of recording symptoms reliably are discussed.

  ".W": "Using health statistics from the United States and England and Wales, we review the epidemiology of constipation and possible etiologies of this disorder as suggested by its epidemiologic distribution. The analysis revealed that constipation is one of the most common chronic digestive disorders in the United States, affecting one of every 50 people. The occurrence of constipation increased with advancing age, showing an exponential increase in prevalence after the age of 65. The age distribution of constipation was similar in both sexes, but overall constipation was three times more common in women than in men. Constipation more frequently affected nonwhites than whites, and people from families with low income or less formal education. The characteristic epidemiologic pattern of constipation suggests the influence of environmental factors. Insufficient dietary fiber is widely believed to be a major cause of constipation, yet it is difficult to devise a mechanism by which dietary fiber alone could produce the marked differences observed between gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of neural regulation of colonic motility plays an important role in the development of chronic constipation. This loss of neural regulation may result from mechanical damage to the pelvic nerves due to childbirth or pelvic surgery, exposure to environmental toxins (e.g., organochlorine insecticides or heavy metals), or possibly exposure to an infectious agent. Other environmental factors that may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic constipation have not yet been elucidated. Consequently, studies examining the epidemiology of chronic constipation are important for providing insight into potential environmental risk factors relevant to the etiology of this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "90010105\r", 
  ".W": "CD45R is a high molecular weight (p205/220) form of a series of transmembrane glycoproteins, collectively known as CD45 and present in some form on all lymphoid cells. We have proposed that CD45R+ thymocytes, a minority (15 to 30%) of total thymocytes, represent the generative thymic lineage whereas CD45 p180+ thymocytes are destined for intrathymic death. To test this hypothesis, we prepared human thymus fractions enriched for the expression of CD45R by exhaustive depletion of CD45 p180+ cells, as well as progenitor CD3-4-8- \"multinegative\" thymocytes which are predominantly CD45R+. Northern analysis of RNA extracted from CD45 p180- and multinegative thymus fractions demonstrated that these populations are enriched for cells able to synthesize mRNA encoding IL-2 and IL-2R after mitogenic stimulation, as compared to unfractionated thymus, consistent with the properties expected for generative thymocytes. Postulating that the CD45R glycoprotein might represent an important signal delivery molecule, we analyzed the ability of mAb specific for CD45 epitopes to synergize with suboptimal amounts of PHA and PMA in the stimulation of IL-2 mRNA production by multinegative thymocytes. We found that CD45R-specific mAb synergizes strongly with PHA/PMA to stimulate IL-2 and IL-2R mRNA expression. In contrast, mAb to CD45 common determinants were unable to synergize. Multinegative thymocytes depleted of all CD45 p180+ cells were compared to total multinegative cells and found to synthesize fourfold greater levels of IL-2 mRNA after stimulation with anti-CD45R mAb. This CD45 p180- multinegative subset is enriched for cells expressing a high density of CD45R, and for CD45- thymus cells, suggesting a possible enrichment for nonlymphoid cells which may play a role in the stimulation process. Our results suggest that the extended amino acid insert of CD45R plays a fundamental role in transmembrane signalling, and that CD45R may be a primary signal transducer for developing thymic progenitor cells.\r"

  ".U": "90010108\r", 
  ".W": "The genomes of most vertebrates contain numerous retroviral sequences, the great majority of which are non-infectious. These endogenous retroviral sequences are transcribed and translated in many host tissues, and are induced by mitogens. The function, if any, of endogenous retroviruses has been unclear. The transmembrane envelope proteins of some infectious type C retroviruses suppress lymphocyte activation, but it is unknown whether any endogenous type C retroviruses share this suppressive activity. To study the possible effects of murine endogenous retroviral expression, specific antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized complementary to type C retroviral sequences, and were cultured with murine spleen cells. If any of these endogenous retroviruses are suppressing lymphocyte activation, then inhibiting such endogenous retroviral-mediated suppression with antisense might result in lymphocyte stimulation. Three classes of endogenous type C retroviral sequences may be distinguished by antisense oligonucleotides (based on their homology to infectious retroviruses): ecotropic, xenotropic, and mink cell focus-forming (MCF). Antisense oligonucleotides to endogenous MCF envelope gene (env) initiation regions caused: i) doubling or tripling of spleen cell RNA synthesis, and ii) marked increases in lymphocyte surface Ia and Ig expression relative to control oligonucleotides. Antisense oligos to xenotropic or ecotropic env sequences or to endogenous MCF non-envelope sequences had no effect. These data suggest that endogenous MCF sequences exert an inhibitory influence on the murine immune system. Because endogenous MCF expression is inducible by immune stimuli, such expression could constitute an inhibitory feedback circuit that participates in the regulation of immune homeostasis.\r"

  ".U": "90010110\r", 
  ".W": "Studies of T cell adhesion and activation reveal two new functions of the CD44 molecule, a molecule now recognized to be identical to three molecules of functional interest: Pgp-1, Hermes, and extracellular matrix receptor type III (ECMRIII). By screening for mAb which inhibit T cell adhesion to E, we have identified a functionally unique CD44-specific mAb, NIH44-1, which partially inhibits T cell rosetting by binding to CD44 on the E. NIH44-1, which immunoprecipitates a protein of 85 to 110 kDa with broad tissue distribution, was determined to be specific for CD44 based on comparison of its tissue distribution with multiple CD44-specific reference mAb and sequential immunoprecipitation with such mAb. Anticipating a role for many adhesion molecules in signal transduction, we studied the effect of CD44 mAb on T cell activation and observed that CD44 mAb dramatically augments T cell proliferation induced by CD3- and CD2-receptor-mediated activation. The augmentation of the response to immobilized CD3 mAb by exhaustively monocyte-depleted T cells indicates that augmentation can be mediated by binding to the T cell. Thus, our studies demonstrate specific new roles for CD44 in T cell adhesion and activation. Furthermore, we suggest that: 1) CD44 has a role in adhesion of cells of multiple lineages; and 2) CD44 may participate in adhesion not (only) by functioning as an adhesion receptor but rather by serving as an anchorage site for other adhesion molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial Ag, especially those of mycobacteria, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental inflammatory arthritis in rodents, while in man, reactive arthritis has a clear temporal relationship to infection with particular bacteria. To investigate the role of immune responses to bacterial Ag in inflammatory arthritis, we have examined the proliferative responses of paired synovial fluid and PBMC when stimulated with 1) suspensions of irradiated or heat-killed bacteria associated with reactive arthritis (ReA), 2) purified protein derivative, 3) a recombinant 65-kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium leprae. The 65-kDa Ag was stimulatory to synovial fluid mononuclear cells, but not PBMC, from patients with different arthropathies, including most of those with ReA, but also some with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the magnitude of these responses correlated more closely with responses to ReA-associated bacteria (such as Salmonella), than with responses to the mycobacterial Ag represented in purified protein derivative. These results suggest that the 65-kDa molecule, which is common to a wide range of bacteria, may be an important immunogen for the T cell-mediated immune responses within the joint in different clinically defined inflammatory arthropathies.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF is an acidic glycoprotein involved in the hemopoietic response to inflammation and in the functional activation of mature blood cells. The protein is produced in response to a number of inflammatory mediators by mesenchymal cells present in the hemopoietic microenvironment and at peripheral sites of inflammation. To understand the molecular basis for the regulation of GM-CSF gene expression, nuclear run-on assays and a functional analysis of potential regulatory sequences were performed in normal human endothelial cells. These studies suggest that GM-CSF is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. By using hybrid constructs containing a reporter gene and varying lengths of the regions flanking the human GM-CSF gene, a 14-bp sequence was identified in the region upstream of the GM-CSF cap site which increased reporter expression in response to a number of inflammatory mediators. In addition, despite a failure to detect GM-CSF-specific RNA or protein in unstimulated cells, basal transcription from the GM-CSF promoter was readily detectable. To account for this apparent discrepancy, sequences present in the 3' untranslated region of the GM-CSF gene were found to substantially reduce the level of reporter gene expression in a number of cell types. Homologous sequences are found in other genes which share a similar pattern of expression, and may provide the molecular basis for the coordinate regulation of multiple inflammatory response genes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of murine rTNF-alpha on the binding of human 125I-rCSF-1 to murine thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) was investigated. At 4 degrees C, 125I-CSF-1 binding to PEM was inhibited by preincubation with human rCSF-1, but not by other cytokines. When PEM were incubated with various cytokines at 37 degrees C, murine rTNF-alpha caused greater than 90% decrease in 125I-CSF-1 binding. This decrease was time, temperature and TNF dose dependent, and was not affected by preincubation with cycloheximide. The reduction in CSF-1-binding activity was reversed by prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C even in the presence of TNF. However, PEM preincubated with TNF subsequently washing free of residual TNF resulted in a rapid recovery of CSF-1 binding. This recovery of CSF-1-binding activity required protein synthesis. Binding studies suggested that the decrease in 125I-CSF-1 binding was most likely caused by a reduction in the number of CSF-1 receptors. In addition, preincubation with TNF at 37 degrees C inhibited 125I-CSF-1 binding on mononuclear phagocytes, including the macrophage cell line J774, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and nonelicited macrophages from three different strains of mice. In contrast, 125I-murine rTNF-alpha binding to PEM was not inhibited by preincubation with CSF-1 at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. These data suggest that TNF may play a role in the modulation of receptor expression on blood cells, and may point to a role for this pleiotropic cytokine in the regulation of hemopoiesis.\r"

Two clones of JR-2 were generated that retained this LMW-BCGF responsiveness, exhibiting similar dose/response characteristics but differing phenotypically. The B10 clone grows as single, discrete, small round cells, whereas D3 grows in aggregates. The clones also differ in the expression of cell surface Ag, D3 being weakly DR+ and strongly CD23+, whereas B10 lacks these Ag. The CD23 on D3 cells binds IgE. Both clones are T9+, 4F2+, B1-, B2- and CALLA-. D3 expresses surface IgG and differentiates in the presence of LMW-BCGF, to secrete IgG. B10 lacks surface and cytoplasmic Ig and fails to differentiate in response to LMW-BCGF. CD23 cannot be induced on B10 by incubation with either LMW-BCGF or IL-4. B10 does not shed CD23 and shed CD23 is not a growth factor for either cloned line. Expression of CD23 on D3 cells is not affected by preincubation with LMW-BCGF. Neither B10 or D3 cells respond to rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-4, rIL-6, rTNF-alpha/beta, rIFN-gamma, or to high m.w. BCGF (Namalwa), alone or in combination. Both clones absorb BCGF activity and crossover absorptions indicate that the clones remove growth factors required by each other. D3 and B10 both appear therefore to respond selectively to LMW-BCGF. These data suggest that the loss of CD23 from a cloned derivative of the cell line JR-2, although accompanied by considerable phenotypic change, is not associated with the disappearance of LMW-BCGF responsiveness, indicating that CD23 is not the essential receptor for LMW-BCGF.\r"

Double staining with anti-RNP serum and CRP produced very similar staining patterns. By counterimmunoelectrophoresis CRP was bound to extractable nuclear antigens found in rabbit thymus extract. The reactive components of the extract were only partially sensitive to treatment with RNase. CRP immunoprecipitated the U1 RNA species from [32P]labeled HeLa cells and the protein bands of the Sm/RNP complex from [35S]-methionine-labeled HeLa cells. By blotting, CRP bound to several discrete bands in a calcium-dependent, PC-inhibitable manner. Two of the bands comigrated with the 70K protein band associated with the U1 snRNP, and its major breakdown product. Binding to these bands was inhibited by both EDTA and PC indicating that CRP binds these proteins through the PC-binding site. Binding to the 70K protein of the U1 snRNP was confirmed by reactivity with the recombinant 70K protein in a dot blot. These findings indicate the CRP binds to the U1-RNP snRNP particle. Considering the ability of CRP to inhibit antibody responses to its ligands and its ability to activate C and promote phagocytosis it is suggested that CRP may play a role in the regulation of autoantibody responses to nuclear Ag.\r"

In our study overlapping synthetic peptides copying the entire sequence of PepM5 protein were used to map the myosin cross-reactive epitopes of streptococcal M protein recognized by mouse and human mAb and affinity purified myosin-specific antibodies from acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease sera. Overlapping M protein peptides SM5(164-197)C and SM5(184-197)C inhibited the murine mAb reactions with PepM5 protein. The human mAb and affinity purified myosin-specific antibodies reacted exclusively with SM5(184-197)C. However, one of the five different purified myosin-specific antibodies not only reacted with SM5(184-197)C but also reacted with SM5(84-116)C. The synthetic subpeptides SM5(175-184)C and SM5(188-197C) did not react with any of the antibodies to PepM5 and myosin demonstrating a requirement of the 184-188 amino acid sequence for antibody recognition. A heptapeptide containing the sequence SM5(183-189) was also found to inhibit selected human myosin-specific antibodies and a human antimyosin mAb. Therefore, the majority of mouse and human myosin crossreactive antibodies recognized an epitope within the 14 residue carboxy terminus of PepM5 which appeared to involve the GLN-LYS-SER-LYS-GLN sequence.\r"

Hybridization analysis of total RNA from 13 rat tissues demonstrated the presence of an 800 nucleotides-long mRNA in all the tissues surveyed, with the highest levels in spleen, thymus, and lung. Examination of thymic cells showed that the thymosin-beta 4 gene is predominantly expressed in thymocytes. The thymosin-beta 4 mRNA was also studied in Ig+ and Ig- lymphocytes, being fourfold more abundant in Ig- than Ig+ splenic lymphocytes, whereas similar levels were found in both types of blood cells. The analysis of RNA from T cells at different maturation stages evidenced slight differences in their thymosin-beta 4 mRNA content, indicating that thymosin-beta 4 gene expression is not clearly related to the differentiation process of T cells. All these results do not support the roles for thymosin-beta 4 in cellular immunity and differentiation of lymphoid cells, suggesting a more general function for this peptide. Preliminary characterization of the human beta 4 gene by restriction analysis disclosed a complicated pattern consistent with multiple genes and/or introns. The analysis of genomic DNA from different species ranging from humans to Escherichia coli showed that this gene is only highly conserved in mammals.\r"

Upon culture their phenotype changes, their stimulatory activity increases significantly, and they come to resemble lymphoid dendritic cells. Resident murine LC, therefore, might represent a reservoir of immature dendritic cells. We have now used enzyme cytochemistry, a panel of some 80 monoclonal antibodies, and immunofluorescence microscopy or two-color flow cytometry, as well as transmission electron microscopy, to analyse the phenotype and morphology of human LC before and after 2-4 d of bulk epidermal cell culture. In addition, LC were enriched from bulk epidermal cell cultures, and their stimulatory capacity was tested in the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction and the oxidative mitogenesis assay. Cultured human LC resembled human lymphoid dendritic cells in morphology, phenotype, and function. Specifically, LC became non-adherent upon culture and developed sheet-like processes (so-called \"veils\"), decreased their surface ATP/ADP'ase activity, and lost nonspecific esterase activity. As in the mouse, surface expression of MHC class I and II antigens increased significantly, and FcII receptors were significantly reduced. Markers that are expressed by dendritic cells (like CD40) appeared on LC following culture. Cultured human LC were potent T-cell stimulators. Our findings support the view that resident human LC, like murine LC, represent immature precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells in skin-draining lymph nodes.\r"

  ".W": "The ultrasonic imaging technique that we have developed provides cross-sectional images of human skin in vivo with a resolution of about 80 microns axially (i.e., deep into the skin) and 250 microns lateral (parallel to the surface). In order to study aging skin, we obtained ultrasonic images from the mid-forearm (volar and dorsal sides) of 142 women. Ultrasonically, on the images, the dermis appears composed of two bands: a dark superficial one where the ultrasonic waves are propagated in a relatively homogeneous or non-echogenic medium, and a deeper one, which is lighter in color, suggesting a heterogeneous medium. Our results show that skin is thicker on the dorsal than on the volar forearm. In contrast to previously published results, skin thickness remains constant until the seventh decade of life, diminishing thereafter. The relative thickness of the two bands show marked variations with age: a progressive thickening of the dark band, from zero in infants to approximately 75% of total skin thickness in aged subjects, while the light band shows the inverse trend. Comparing the amplitude of the bands on the volar and dorsal forearm, the relative thickness of the dark band is larger on the dorsal (exposed) side and increases with age. These findings and the analysis of variously stained biopsies taken in some of our patients lead us to assign this dark band to a zone in the upper dermis where the collagen network is delicate, dense, and well organized. This is supported by some data in the literature. The thickness of this subepidermal non-echo-genic band appears to be a far more sensitive marker of skin aging at the dermal level than is the measurement of skin thickness.\r"

Light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry of mammalian skin revealed that Merkel cells are exclusively CGA-immunoreactive (ir) and that the immunoreaction is localized in the secretory granules. This finding supports the classification of the Merkel cell as a member of the DNES. The CGA immunoreactivity was restricted to Merkel cells of pigs and humans. In human embryonic skin, CGA was expressed in Merkel cells as early as week 11 of gestation. The antisera differed in their ability to stain Merkel cells in different species and developmental stages, reflecting a variable chemical coding for CGA. CGA probably represents a precursor for smaller regulatory peptides or acts as a messenger on its own on various target tissues, suggesting a neurosecretory function of the Merkel cell.\r"

Vitronectin, a multifunctional plasma and tissue glycoprotein, which inhibits the complement membrane attack complex and promotes cell attachment and spreading, is, like amyloid P component, associated with keratin bodies in vivo. To investigate a potential role for vitronectin in the removal of keratin bodies, we studied the interaction of vitronectin with keratin intermediate filaments in normal human skin and in Hep-2 cells, as well as with isolated keratin intermediate filament aggregates in vitro. Following pre-incubation of skin sections and Hep-2 cells with normal human serum (as a source of vitronectin), cytoplasmic staining of keratinocytes and of cytoskeletal filaments in Hep-2 cells was observed by immuno-fluorescence staining with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-vitronectin antibodies. Vitronectin binding to keratin intermediate filament aggregates extracted from normal human epidermis was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting, and was not dependent on complement activation, because it occurred even when heat-inactivated human serum or C4-deficient serum was used as a source of vitronectin. Amyloid P component shows Ca++- dependent binding to keratin intermediate filament aggregates. does not involve amyloid P component because it occurred when binding of the latter protein was inhibited by EDTA buffer. Moreover, purified vitronectin also bound to keratin intermediate filament aggregates in immunofluorescence studies. Vitronectin binding to keratin intermediate filaments may play a role both in limiting complement-mediated tissue damage (because keratin bodies may activate complement) and in promoting removal of keratin bodies by fibroblasts and/or macrophages.\r"

Using a combination of electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy we show that there is a correlation between the loss of HD and tumor type (i.e., in solid and infiltrative BCC hemidesmosomes are present, sometimes in reduced numbers), while there appears to be a lack of hemidesmosomes in cells of sclerosing specimens. Moreover, even though there is a loss of cytoplasmic constituents of the HD in sclerosing forms of BCC, this is not the case with regard to collagen VII, a component of AF, which are normally associated with the extracellular side of the HD. Collagen VII is localized to the basement membrane zone of tumor cells in the absence of the cytoplasmic constituents of HD. Furthermore, deposits of collagen VII occur in the connective tissue close to tumor cell populations in all but one of the BCC specimens we analyzed. In addition to modifications in HD and AF in BCC tissue, there are changes in the cytoskeletal elements of both tumor cells and the normal appearing epidermis that overlies tumor areas. In sclerosing BCC microfilaments are commonly observed along the basal portions of tumor cells where they abut the connective tissue. IF are often found interacting with these microfilaments. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of tumor tissue using a monoclonal keratin antibody preparation, AE1, which in normal epidermis stains basal cells, reveals that AE1 antibodies only weakly stain tumor cells. Moreover, in the epidermis that overlies tumor cell regions AE1 antibodies stain suprabasal cells and not basal cells. This change in staining pattern generated by AE1 antibodies appears to depend upon the proximity of tumor cells. These results are discussed in relation to the organization of the HD and its associated AF and IF. The possibility that HD, IF, and AF antibody preparations may be of diagnostic use is raised.\r"

In the normal epidermis, few of the nuclei were labeled with anti-PCNA/cyclin. This was in contrast to the positive nuclear staining seen in active lesions of psoriasis. In a primary culture of human keratinocytes growing as a monolayer, 20%-30% of cells expressed PCNA/cyclin. SV40-transformed human keratinocytes showed positive nuclear staining in about 40% of the cell population. In stratified keratinocytes cultured in a high Ca++ medium, PCNA/cyclin expression was decreased and only the cells in the basal and suprabasal layers showed positive staining. These results indicate that the expression of PCNA/cyclin correlates with the proliferating state in human keratinocytes and may not be associated with the mechanism of differentiation in keratinocytes.\r"

By immunofluorescent microscopy, a number of different cell types appeared to be CD4+; positive cells were observed in the lining and stroma of the chorionic villi. Some of these CD4+ cells dual-labeled with the trophoblastic marker placental lactogen. In addition, CD4+ cells were observed within the lining of placental blood vessels. Organ cultures of first-trimester and term placentas were infectable by HIV as monitored by reverse transcriptase activity of culture supernatants and by immunofluorescent labeling of HIV antigens. One potential route of congenital HIV transmission may be direct placental infection by HIV as early as the first trimester, with subsequent transplacental spread of the virus.\r"

Elderly controls and subjects with asymptomatic bacteriuria had variable titers; control titers were significantly lower than those with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Titers were stable over 2-12 w in asymptomatic subjects. Elderly subjects with invasive infection and women with pyelonephritis demonstrated increases in titer between acute and convalescent serum for E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. With a convalescent specimen with an antibody titer greater than or equal to 3 standard deviations (SD) above the acute, the sensitivity of the MOMP ELISA for identifying invasive infection was 74%, the specificity 86%, the positive predictive value 82%, and the negative predictive value 79%. With the criteria of greater than or equal to 3 SD or an initial serum to control ratio of greater than or equal to 15 these parameters were 95%, 82%, 82%, and 95%, respectively. These initial investigations suggest the MOMP of E. coli may be an antigen with wide cross-reactivity, suitable for use as an objective test to identify invasive Enterobacteriaceae urinary infection.\r"

This clone is rarely observed among type b strains recovered from patients with invasive type b disease in the USA or Europe. The nontypable isolates in Islamabad also were clonally restricted: 9 clonal groups were found among 34 isolates, with just 5 clonal groups accounting for most (82%) of the strains.

Yeasts added to confluent endothelium in citrated platelet-poor plasma adhered on the average of 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per culture well. When platelets were added as platelet-rich plasma, a significant increase of yeast adherence was not seen. However, when endothelium was contracted by treatment with 2 mM EDTA, resulting in exposure of ECM, yeast adherence was increased to 10 cfu/well. When platelets were added with these yeasts, the number of adhering yeasts was further increased to 23 cfu/well (P less than .01). This represented an increase in adherence of yeasts of 230%. When the endothelial cells were completely removed and ECM exposed, platelets were found to likewise augment yeast adherence. Platelets, when added to the ECM, formed aggregates to which the yeasts firmly adhered. Likewise, when platelets were aggregated by adenosine diphosphate and mixed with yeasts, yeasts were shown to bind avidly to aggregated platelets, whereas yeasts did not adhere to unactivated, discoid platelets. Thus, exposed subendothelial ECM induces the aggregation of platelets and yeasts bind avidly to these platelet aggregates.\r"

All semen samples were subjected to the swim-up procedure to harvest the motile sperm before inseminations of human oocytes. Fertilization was considered to have occurred when at least one oocyte was observed with two or more pronuclei. Semen samples were classified as infertile (0% fertilization rate; N = 32) or fertile (greater than 0% fertilization rate; N = 82) before statistical analyses. There was a significant difference (P less than 0.005) in percentage normal morphology of seminal sperm between the fertile (mean +/- SE; 67.3 +/- 1.2%) and the infertile (59.3 +/- 2.2%) samples. The percentage normal morphology of seminal sperm correlated (r = 0.3049; P less than 0.002) with the fertilization rate and this parameter was selected by the multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis as the discriminator capable of predicting the fertilization rate with 57.9% accuracy.

Some procedures were found to affect adversely both the zona pellucida and the cumulus mass, resulting in reductions in the fertilization rate. As a result of both these and previously reported experiments (1-3), an optimal schedule is proposed for the handling of mouse oocytes during cryopreservation, namely, to equilibrate cumulus-intact oocytes in 1.5 M DMSO precooled to 4 degrees C prior to freezing, to remove DMSO at 4 degrees C after thawing prior to restoring the oocytes to 37 degrees C, to loosen or remove the cumulus cells, and then to hold oocytes at 37 degrees C for at least 1 hr to allow recovery of the spindle prior to insemination.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences in the mean day of oocyte retrieval or the mean daily estradiol level up to the day of oocyte retrieval between laparoscopic and transvaginal cycles. The total number of follicles aspirated per cycle, preovulatory oocytes aspirated per cycle, and number of concepti of preovulatory origin transferred per cycle were not statistically different. The number of immature oocytes aspirated per cycle was statistically decreased in transvaginal retrieval cycles, which resulted in an increased total number of concepti transferred per transfer in laparoscopic retrieval cycles. Twelve pregnancies resulted from the transvaginal retrieval cycles (27.9%), seven of which are ongoing or delivered. Ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicular aspiration yields results comparable to laparoscopic retrieval in the same patients and should be the method of choice for oocyte pickup because of its many advantages.\r"

An important relationship between \"calcium metabolism\" and \"salt-sensitivity\" is emerging and appears to be providing insights into potential mechanisms that account for the antihypertensive properties of dietary calcium in certain individuals. More experimental work needs to be performed to further define the individuals with hypertension who demonstrate a blood pressure-lowering response to dietary calcium supplementation.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the growth of hyperplastic parathyroid glands removed at operation from 16 patients with chronic renal failure complicated by hypercalcemia, by incubating fresh tissue with tritiated thymidine. In each gland the proportion of cells synthesizing DNA was determined directly by counting labeled nuclei after autoradiography and indirectly from incorporation of label into DNA, and the mean diameter of chief cell nuclei was measured. Both DNA synthesis and mean nuclear diameter were positively correlated with plasma calcium level. Assuming the mean duration of S phase to be 12 hours, the birthrate of new cells (mean +/- SD) was 18.5% +/- 23.6% per year, significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than the 11.5% +/- 7.4% per year found in 63 parathyroid adenomas previously studied. On the basis of estimated disease duration, the minimum birthrate needed to grow glands of the observed weight was 23.4% +/- 16.5% per year. The similarity between observed and needed birthrates indicates that the glands were growing almost as fast as when renal failure began, and that parathyroid growth was no longer regulated in accordance with normal plasma calcium homeostasis. To account for this, we propose that the disordered growth is a consequence of an increase in secretory set point, which in turn is a consequence of calcitriol deficiency. Because the effectiveness of parathyroid hormone is impaired in renal failure, a large increase in total hormone secretion is needed to raise the plasma calcium level to the new set point, and the necessary increase in gland size can be achieved only by a sustained increase in the rate of cell division.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody reagents were used to develop a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay for clinical measurement of circulating transferrin receptor. By using transferrin-bound receptor for the preparation of the immunologic reagents, we developed an assay that gives an identical dose-response curve with either free or transferrin-bound receptor. The mean concentration of circulating receptor in 82 normal male and female volunteers was 5.63 +/- 1.42 mg/L. The level was reduced significantly in patients with primary aplastic anemia and post-transplant aplasia (2.58 +/- 1.07 mg/L and 2.32 +/- 0.48 mg/L, respectively) and was sharply elevated in patients with hemolytic anemia and iron deficiency anemia (33.1 +/- 17 and 18.0 +/- 11.4 mg/L, respectively). Our assay values are approximately 20-fold higher than results published previously in a study that used an immunoradiometric assay. The disparity apparently relates to a difference in sensitivity of the latter assay for free and transferrin-bound receptor. Measurements of serum transferrin receptor provide a useful clinical index of either total or iron-deficiency erythropoiesis.\r"

Before and after each 4-d treatment period, blood pressure (determined by random zero sphygmomanometer), body weight, plasma renin activity, angiotensin converting enzyme, plasma potassium, serum creatinine and the 24-h urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were measured. Indomethacin attenuated the decrease of supine diastolic blood pressure during treatment with captopril, but not with enalapril. However, the initial decrease of blood pressure on captopril was greater than on enalapril. Both converting enzyme inhibitors had no effect on the urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, while indomethacin reduced it. The results suggest a difference between captopril and enalapril in interaction with indomethacin.\r"

Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) and left atrial (LA) dimension were measured from the echocardiogram, and the cardiac volume in ml/m2 body surface area (BSA) was calculated from the chest X-ray. A progressive increase in LA dimension was noticed during the 6-month period: a significant increase after 2 months (P less than 0.001) with a further increase at 6 months compared with after 2 months (P less than 0.001). The changes in LA dimension were more pronounced in anterior and Q-wave infarction (P less than 0.001) than in inferior and non-Q-wave infarction (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, LVEDd showed a less conspicuous change: a moderate increase (P less than 0.05) at 2 and 6 months, also with a more pronounced change in anterior wall and Q-wave infarction (P less than 0.01). There was no significant concurrent change in the calculated heart volume in ml/m2 BSA, as measured from the chest X-ray. It is suggested that the observed changes in LA dimension reflect reduced left ventricular compliance after MI.\r"

The approach to the management of this disorder varies widely from specialty to specialty despite the recent publication of studies that provide for rational treatment of febrile seizures. Most children do not need any treatment after a first simple febrile seizure. In certain children who are at risk for recurrent febrile seizures, rectal anticonvulsants should be considered for acute, short-term management. Long-term anticonvulsants should be reserved for patients who are unable to use rectal anticonvulsants or who have significant risk factors for the development of afebrile seizures.\r"

The results indicate no systematic variation in either reliability (test-retest, internal consistency), dimensionality, or ability of the CES-D Scale to detect clinical depression among Anglos or persons of Mexican origin classified according to language use as Spanish dominant, English dominant, or bilingual. However, the data indicate that this particular screening instrument does not adequately discriminate between patients with clinical depression and those without depression. These results corroborate several recent studies that question the utility of the CES-D Scale as a depression screening instrument. Taken together, the available evidence suggests that the ability of the CES-D Scale to detect major depression is so limited that further use of the instrument as a screening scale would seem unwarranted, at least in treatment settings.\r"

The data support the conclusion that Italian society has successfully generated a psychiatric system without asylums. However, although psychiatrically disabled patients have been successfully shifted to community services, more effort is necessary in Italy to extend the reform to resource-poor regions as well as to the most debilitated patient groups.\r"

They were characterised by a golden or, less frequently, brown-reddish proteinaceous or haemorrhagic fluid content. The cyst wall, up to 2 mm thick, consisted of clusters of normal pineal parenchymal cells, often compressed and distorted, surrounded by reactive gliotic tissue which sometimes contained Rosenthal fibres. The presenting clinical features included headache (6/7), signs of raised intracranial pressure, partial or complete Parinaud's syndrome (5/7), cerebellar deficits (2/7), corticospinal and corticopontine fibre (2/7) or sensory (1/7) deficits, and emotional disturbances (2/7). CT and MRI (in 2/7 cases) scans showed a hypodense or nonhomogeneous lesion in the region of the pineal gland, with or without contrast enhancement. Surgical excision resulted in complete clearance of the symptoms in 5/7 patients. The previous literature is reviewed and the clinicopathological correlations and the possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed. The need to distinguish this benign lesion from other mass lesions of the pineal region, in particular from pinealocytoma, is stressed.\r"

To investigate the neurotropism of HTLV-I, we exposed cultured human and simian glial cells to HTLV-I. Primary mixed glial cell cultures of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were obtained from adult human and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brains by an enzyme digestion-Percoll gradient method. After two weeks in vitro, the cells were co-cultured with irradiated MT-2 cells, an HTLV-I-producing T-cell line. Cultures were double stained with antibodies against cell-type specific markers and anti-HTLV-I p19 (gag) monoclonal antibody. The HTLV-I antigen was demonstrated in small numbers of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells (astrocytes) and galactocerebroside-positive cells (oligodendrocytes) in both the human and simian cultures. Electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of type C virus-like particles in the cytoplasm of astrocytes. These results indicate that HTLV-I is capable of infecting human and simian glial cells in vitro.\r"

Colchicine was inoculated into the striatum at various times before and after inoculation of rabies virus into the same site. Rats were killed at various times after viral inoculation and the spread of rabies virus was monitored by rabies immunofluorescence of selected areas of brain. The most effective inhibitory effect was obtained by colchicine treatment applied two days before virus inoculation. Under these conditions, no fluorescent foci could be detected until day 3 post-infection whereas control rats exhibited infected cells as soon as two days post-infection. This inhibitory effect is reversible and the general consequence seems to be a delay in the rate of viral spread. However, five days after the virus challenge, some major brain areas were still partially preserved from infection (striatum, frontal cortex, pyriform cortex). Ten days after colchicine treatment, the microtubules have recovered their capacity to transport the virus. At the onset of paralysis, the general pattern of infection in brain sections from colchicine-treated rats was not significantly different from that of control rats. This inhibitory effect on the transport of rabies virus can be prolonged by administration of additional colchicine.\r"

GFAP-positive glial cells, cells immunolabelled for some macrophage markers and dystrophic neurites were detected in congophilic plaques with crystalline amyloid, but not in the amorphous, non-congophilic plaques. The presence of alpha l-antichymotrypsin, complement factors and P component, but not of common serum proteins in both the amorphous and congophilic plaques, indicates that these three proteins may have a pathogenetic role in amyloid formation. Amorphous plaques may be the earlier forms of plaque and consequently, the presence of reactive cells and dystrophic neurites may be secondary phenomena.\r"

We are studying neuronal surface components with a library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) made to highly purified, exclusively cholinergic nerve terminals of the Torpedo ray. The most extensively characterized of the Tor MAbs. Tor 23, binds the external membrane of some human neuronal cells in culture. Our present findings demonstrate that Tor 23, in situ, binds the apparent limiting membrane of rare neurons of the human isocortex. Tor 23 binds, in addition, internally within a subpopulation of subcortical white matter astrocytes, as identified by colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein. Neuronal surface binding of Tor 23 parallels our findings in other species: astrocyte staining was not observed in other species and may be unique to human. Immunoblot analysis of white matter reveals one polypeptide band with a relative mobility of 115,000 +/- 15,000 daltons. In the mid-frontal cortex from cases of AD. Tor 23 immunopositive neurons are greatly reduced in number and immunopositive astrocytes are completely absent. The reduction of the neuronal surface epitope defined by Tor 23 supports the recent hypothesis that surface molecules are altered in AD. The absence of Tor 23 positive astrocytes opens an area for specific investigation: namely, the role subcortical astrocytes may play in the pathogenesis of AD.\r"

Although tumor was identified in all three zones, diagnostic yield was significantly higher in the hypodense center and enhancing margin.

Tumor was found up to 15 mm beyond the CT-enhancing margin, in addition to extending beyond the area of abnormality on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. These findings suggest that serial stereotactic biopsies should be targeted to the hypodense center and enhancing margin for improved diagnostic yield. Biopsy material obtained from the hypodense periphery that demonstrates tumor also indicates that a tumor volume beyond the confines of the CT-enhancing margin should be considered when calculating dosimetry for interstitial radiation.\r"

Germinomas are seen more frequently than nongerminomatous germ-cell tumors; they are often curable with radiotherapeutic approaches, or with chemotherapy in the rare instance of extraneural metastasis. Nongerminomatous germ-cell tumors are relatively radioresistant and when extraneural metastasis has occurred, they have been fatal in all of the 32 previously reported cases. The case of a 14-year-old girl with a mixed malignant germ-cell tumor arising in the pineal region is reported. Extraneural metastasis to the lung developed 12 months after whole-brain radiotherapy was completed. She was treated with etoposide (VP-16), high-dose cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin and is currently without evidence of disease 46 months postmetastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is emerging as a very useful clinical tool and is adding a great deal to our understanding of the pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have had a dramatic impact on patient management, there is often an important associated function abnormality which is best assessed by PET. In normal aging and in dementia, the CT and MRI brain changes of atrophy and white matter abnormalities are frequently nonspecific. PET has been more diagnostic, showing characteristic regional metabolic abnormalities. Evaluation of brain tumors such as astrocytomas with PET has demonstrated better correlation with histologic grade compared to CT. Unlike CT or MRI, PET can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor, and can differentiate the extent of metabolically active tumor from surrounding edema. PET is useful in evaluating stroke patients, providing better prognostic information and demonstrating abnormalities sooner than CT. In epilepsy, PET appears to be superior to MRI in localizing seizure foci in patients with partial seizures. In head trauma patients, metabolic patterns are being described which will likely have an effect on patient management. The use of PET in schizophrenia has yielded very interesting results, with common patterns of metabolic abnormalities being demonstrated. CT and MRI in these patients have not been very useful. PET has also shown promise in movement disorders such as Huntington's disease. It is now clear that PET is already clinically useful and can provide valuable information unobtainable by CT and MRI. As new radioligands are developed, PET is certain to assume an even more important role in the future.\r"

Excellent cardiac blood-pool images were obtained by [99mTc]DTPA-HSA method. Biodistribution studies showed higher accumulation of [99mTc]DTPA-HSA than that of 99mTc RBC in the lungs and liver, but similar count ratios of the cardiovascular blood pool to whole body between the two methods. In ECG-gated end-diastolic images, no quantitatively significant difference was observed in left ventricular target-to-background ratios between these two methods. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) calculated by [99mTc]DTPA-HSA MUGA method was correlated well with that by contrast LVEF (r = 0.91). No side effects were observed in any patient. In conclusion, cardiac blood-pool scintigraphy using [99mTc] DTPA-HSA is readily performed by single i.v. injection and useful for the assessment of cardiac function.\r"

By 48 h after injection of FS-T, food intake and the concentration of total plasma amino acids had returned to normal. Plasma tryptophan levels and the ratio of tryptophan to neutral amino acids were also monitored to elucidate the relation between FS-T and appetite. Two h after injection of FS-T, the ratio of tryptophan to neutral amino acids had increased in Wistar rats, while no change was detected in either obese or lean Zucker rats. However, no change was observed in plasma glucagon levels in Wistar rats, but a significant increase was found in both obese and lean Zucker rats at 2 h after FS-T injection.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare two strategies for the evaluation and management of patients who have had acute dyspepsia for four days or more: empiric high-dose antacid therapy combined with patient reassurance (empiric care) versus therapy based on prompt upper gastrointestinal radiography (traditional care). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial. The patients in the empiric care group were reassured that upper gastrointestinal radiography was not necessary and were subsequently treated with high-dose empiric antacid therapy (15-30 ml of high-potency antacid one and three hours after meals and at bedtime). The traditional care group after meals and at bedtime). The traditional care group received upper gastrointestinal radiography as part of the initial evaluation. Subsequent treatment was determined by individual physicians based on test results. SETTINGS: Fee-for-service, hospital-based primary care practice and Veteran's Administration medical center outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: All patients were less than 70 years of age and without gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, significant weight loss, or other specified symptoms of severe acid peptic disease. Fifty patients were randomized to traditional care, and 51 to empiric care. Pre-randomization clinical features were identical with the exception of sex distribution and baseline disability. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After six months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in symptom scores, disability, satisfaction, and quality of life measures (as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile scores) between the two groups. Findings were unchanged when adjusted for sex, study site, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. Of the radiographs obtained in the traditional care group, 13 (27%) showed duodenal ulcer disease, gastritis, or duodenitis. There were no serious complications of ulcer disease or therapy noted in either group. The average costs per patient associated with traditional care at one study site were greater, $286 versus $116 (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Select patients with dyspepsia receiving a combination of reassurance and empiric antacid therapy do as well as patients whose initial management strategy includes upper gastrointestinal radiography, at a substantially lower cost.\r"

SETTING: Emergency rooms of three university and four community hospitals. PATIENTS: 7,734 emergency room patients with acute chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 10% of the 3,896 women, compared with 19% of the 3,838 men, yielding an age-adjusted relative risk of myocardial infarction for women of 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.48, 0.60). Physicians were equally adept at admitting women and men with myocardial infarctions, but men without myocardial infarction or unstable angina were significantly more likely to be admitted than were women without these diagnoses. Most clinical and electrocardiographic features indicating a risk of myocardial infarction were present in both women and men, but several high-risk features were less commonly present in women. After adjusting for the other factors that correlate with each patient's probability of having acute myocardial infarction, the relative risk of myocardial infarction was the same in women as men when the emergency department electrocardiogram showed the classic changes associated with acute myocardial infarction, but the risk was 40% lower in women when such electrocardiographic changes were not present. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features that predict myocardial infarction in men predict myocardial infarction in women to a similar extent. However, female gender is associated with about a 40% lower rate of myocardial infarction except when classic electrocardiographic evidence is present on the emergency department electrocardiogram.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, controlled trial of five-months' duration. SETTING: A university hospital-based, general medical clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine junior and senior medical residents who saw patients in stable clinic teams throughout the study. INTERVENTION: A computerized reminder system for physicians and a patient questionnaire and educational hand-out on preventive care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delivery of five of six audited preventive services improved significantly after the interventions were introduced. The computerized reminder alone increased completion rates of services that relied primarily on physician initiative; the questionnaire alone increased completion rate of the service that depended more on patient compliance as well as on some physician-dependent services. Both interventions used together were slightly less effective in improving performance of physician-dependent services than the computerized reminder used alone. CONCLUSIONS: These interventions can improve the delivery of preventive care but they differ in their impacts on physician and patient behaviors. Overall, the computer reminder was the more effective intervention.\r"

Attention was paid to issues of designing a blind study, providing a washout period, and measuring and reproducing the effect. In this randomized, double-blind trial, three changes of formula were made: for each of four 4-day periods, colicky infants alternately received a casein hydrolysate formula (Nutramigen) and a formula containing cow milk. Mothers recorded crying in diaries and indicated which crying episodes they considered to have been caused by colic. Nine infants were started on Nutramigen and eight on the cow milk formula. With the first formula change there was significantly less crying and colic in infants when they were fed Nutramigen than when they were fed cow milk (p less than 0.01); with the second change there was less colic when infants were fed Nutramigen (p less than 0.05) but not significantly less crying. By the third change there were no significant differences between formulas. Further analyses demonstrated that there were more clinically meaningful positive responses (a change in crying by at least one third) to Nutramigen than to cow milk (p less than 0.05). However, only one subject had a clinically meaningful response in colic to all three formula changes. These results demonstrate that in some instances, colic improves with elimination of cow milk formula. However, the effect diminishes with time, and only infrequently is the effect reproducible.\r"

Anthropometrics, ventilatory measurements, and the results of pulmonary function tests were evaluated at study entry and at 1, 4, and 8 weeks into therapy. Poststudy chest radiographs were compared with those obtained before the study. The proportion of infants alive at discharge was significantly increased (84%) in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (47%) (p = 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in total hospital days or in total ventilator days. Total respiratory system compliance at 4 weeks was higher in the treatment group (0.61 +/- 0.18) than in the placebo group (0.45 +/- 0.13) (p = 0.016). No difference in outcome was detected between male and female infants in the treatment group.

  ".W": "A prospective, random selection, double-blind clinical trial was carried out to determine the efficacy of indomethacin in preventing periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH). Babies who were born in our institution, had birth weights less than or equal to 1500 gm, and had no PV-IVH or grade 1 PV-IVH were given either placebo (n = 70) or indomethacin (n = 71), 0.2 mg/kg intravenously at 6 hours of age and 0.1 mg/kg at 18 and 30 hours. Two major outcomes were determined: the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and the development of severe PV-IVH (i.e., hemorrhages with blood filling greater than 50% of the ventricles and in some cases with associated parenchymal echodensities). Grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH occurred in 16 (23%) of the indomethacin group and 27 (39%) of the placebo group (p less than 0.03). The incidence of severe PV-IVH was 3% in the indomethacin-treated babies and 14% in the control group (p less than 0.02). The influence of other perinatal factors on the incidence of grades 2 to 4 or severe PV-IVH was determined by stepwise logistic regression. Placebo use, early grade 1 PV-IVH, lower birth weight, and higher fraction of inspired oxygen at 6 hours of life were associated with higher estimated odds of the development of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH. Placebo use, male gender, lower 5-minute Apgar score, and a large base deficit were predictive of severe PV-IVH. Estimated odds ratios of severe PV-IVH with placebo use and male gender were 11.25:1 and 9:1, respectively. Thus indomethacin prophylaxis reduced the relative risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH and severe PV-IVH, but other perinatal variables contributed significantly to the overall risk of PV-IVH.\r"

The regulation of virion protein expression occurs via posttranscriptional regulation of viral mRNA. In some contexts, regulation of the virion proteins is achieved by p27rex-dependent accumulation of unspliced or singly spliced mRNAs that specify capsid or envelope proteins. In other contexts, the envelope protein production is dependent upon p27rex even in the presence of accumulation of envelope-specific mRNA. The consequences of p27 regulation for HTLV-I replication are discussed.\r"

The effects of the substances were measured quantitatively with two different assays: (i) inhibition of cell-free viral infection and (ii) inhibition of the fusion reaction induced by cell-to-cell infection. The results showed that cell-free infection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 was almost completely blocked in the presence of all of the substances tested. However, cell-to-cell infection by HIV-1, HIV-2, and HTLV-I was inhibited only by the polysaccharides, E-P-LEM, and glycyrrhizin sulfate but not by the two nucleoside analogues. Moreover, the extent of inhibition of the fusion reaction by the substances varied significantly from strain to strain in HIV-1.\r"

The analysis was performed with lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected persons in various stages of the infection. Peptides covering the entire group antigen (gag), and transmembrane (gp41) regions, and one-half of envelope (gp120) regions of HTLV-IIIB were studied. Both common and patient-unique responses were identified. Twelve common gag T-cell sites were discovered, as well as patient-unique activating peptides. The gag peptides elicited the most frequent cell responses and the responses remained in late stages of disease. Only 1 of the 12 T-cell activating gag peptides was reactive with specific anti-HIV IgG. Eighteen common env-representing peptides evoked T-cell responses. They could be grouped into four previously undescribed regions of gp120 and two known sites, the hypervariable stretch and part of the CD4 binding region. Cell responses to env peptides were common in early stages of disease and tended to decrease in ARC and AIDS. The gp41-representing peptides evoked a cellular response to a region close to the N-terminus of the hydrophobic transmembrane region. In addition to the T-cell activating peptides, peptides representing p15 and p19 as well as previously recognized regions of gp120 and gp41 appeared to be potent B-cell epitopes.\r"

There is evidence that such binding selectively impairs self-recognition. The resulting immunodeficiency syndrome has the characteristics of graft vs. host disease, consistent with chronic allogeneic and semiallogeneic GVHD in mouse-models. since these syndromes are believed to result from triggering the established immunoregulatory mechanisms necessary to maintain self-tolerance, vaccination to prevent AIDS should aim to correct the inability of the HIV host mount an immune response against CD4 binding epitopes on HIV gp120, preferably without exposing the vaccine to intact envelope glycoprotein. Since the AIDS syndrome is probably a defect in net-work immunoregulation, the most appropriate target for therapy and for vaccination is the idiotype of anti-CD4 antibodies that block CD4/env interaction.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of philanthotoxin (PhTX) were studied on the function of glutamate receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA and on binding of radioligands to rat brain glutamate receptors. PhTX reversibly inhibited the oocyte responses to quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate in a dose-dependent manner. The NMDA receptor was the most sensitive to PhTX action (10-fold more than the kainate receptor) and the least sensitive was the smooth current component of the quisqualate response. Recovery from PhTX block differed among the three amino acids. NMDA responses recovered completely within a few minutes whereas responses to kainate and quisqualate recovered more slowly. PhTX had no effect on equilibrium binding of [3H]glutamate to rat brain cortical membranes studied in buffer treated to eliminate microorganisms. Based on the drug specificity of this [3H]glutamate binding, it is suggested to be mostly to the NMDA receptor. Low concentrations of PhTX (1-10 microM) potentiated binding of [3H] MK-801, a specific noncompetitive inhibitor of the NMDA receptor. However, higher PhTX concentrations inhibited this binding with an IC50 of 20 microM, similar to its inhibition of the oocyte-expressed NMDA receptor. Inhibition of [3H]MK-801 binding by PhTX was noncompetitive. It is suggested that PhTX, like the more potent MK-801, binds to an allosteric site on the NMDA receptor and inhibits its function but its binding site is not identical with the MK-801 binding site.\r"

  ".U": "90011788\r", 
  ".W": "Adenosine is a potent inhibitor of renin release. It has therefore been suggested that endogenous adenosine may play a role in the regulation of renin release. Sodium-chloride transport at the level of the macula densa has been proposed as the primary source of endogenous adenosine. Evidence to support a modulatory role of adenosine on renin release in vivo is, however, limited. We therefore wanted to determine if: 1) adenosine modulates furosemide-induced renin release and 2) sodium-chloride reabsorption at the macula densa is essential for adenosine actions. To test these hypotheses, three groups of rats were pretreated either with saline or the adenosine receptor antagonists caffeine or 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine (both at a dose of 30 mg/kg followed by 450 micrograms/kg/min). Rats then received furosemide (50 mg/kg i.v.). In the vehicle group, furosemide increased urinary volume, sodium and potassium excretion and increased plasma renin activity from 6 +/- 1 to 45 +/- 11 ngAl/ml/hr. Caffeine and 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine potentiated the increase in plasma renin activity produced by furosemide (to 120 +/- 15 and 147 +/- 21 ng Al/ml/hr, respectively), whereas having no significant effects on urinary volume, sodium excretion or blood pressure. These results suggest that furosemide-induced renin release in vivo is restrained by endogenous adenosine. In as much as furosemide blocks sodium-chloride transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and the macula densa cells, it appears that under the conditions of this study sodium transport across these segments is not essential to initiate adenosine-mediated mechanisms.\r"

Their sucrase inhibition was poorly reversible. They were much weaker liver lysosomal alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with IC50s of 40,000 nM. 1 alpha-glc-CS and 8 beta-glc-CS were both weaker and less selective sucrase inhibitors. In vivo, 7 alpha-glc-CS and 8 alpha-glc-CS effectively reduced the glycemic response to an oral 2 g/kg sucrose load at doses less than or equal to 1 mg/kg. 8 alpha-glc-CS was effective when administered up to 4 hr before sucrose. The known glucohydrolase inhibitors 1-deoxynojirimycin and N-hydroxyethyl-1-deoxy-nojirimycin were also potent sucrase inhibitors (IC50s = 200 and 400 nM, respectively) but their sucrase inhibition was readily reversible in vitro and their in vivo duration of action was much shorter than for the CS-glcs. Among the glucohydrolase inhibitors tested, the prolonged in vivo duration of action could be predicted by poor reversibility from sucrase. These CS-glcs provide a new generation of sucrase inhibitors which may be useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamic acid and excitatory amino acids specific for the glutamate receptor subtypes were microinjected into the A10 region of the rat. Glutamate produced an increase in motor behavior that was antagonized by pretreatment with the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol. This motor stimulant effect was produced by kainate, but not by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or quisqualic acid. By using in vivo dialysis it was found that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and locomotor activity were enhanced by glutamate injection into the A10 region. Whereas glutamate was found to increase the postmortem concentration of dopamine metabolites in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and A10 region, NMDA selectively increased dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, and kainate produced increases in the nucleus accumbens and A10 region. When glutamate and the NMDA receptor antagonist, 3-[(+/-)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) were coadministered, CPP selectively abolished the effect of glutamate on medial prefrontal cortical dopamine metabolites. A physiological role for the NMDA receptor modulation of A10 dopamine neurons was shown by intra-A10 pretreatment with CPP antagonism of mild footshock-induced increase in dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex. These data argue that glutamate is a regulatory transmitter of A10 dopamine neurons, and that the NMDA receptor subtype modulates neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex whereas the kainate subtype modulates mesoaccumbens neurons.\r"

An association between cervicovaginal colonization with GBS and prematurity could not be demonstrated in six of the seven studies. However, women with asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by GBS had a higher rate of prematurity than did women without asymptomatic bacteriuria.

The association of HPV with neoplasms at that site includes the relationship of specific HPV types with neoplasms and evidence that those HPV DNA types can transform epithelial cells in vitro. The capacity for in vitro transformation has been isolated to specific regions of the HPV genome. That may be unique in cancer-associated viruses. Nevertheless, epidemiologic evidence points to additional factors, including immunologic, habitual and environmental, that may play an important role in the development of lower genital tract carcinomas. In particular, the marked differences in mean age and other variables between women with vulvar precancers and invasive cancer suggest that the evolution of invasive cancer involves more than HPV infection alone. Hence, the prevention of invasive vulvar cancer in older age groups will require an understanding of the unique host factors that render a small group of women susceptible to the disease in the face of an epidemic of HPV infection in the population at large.\r"

  ".W": "Women with infrequent episodes of candidal vaginitis frequently have an identifiable cause, but those with chronic and recurrent candidal vaginitis rarely have recognizable precipitating or causal factors. Although an analysis of vaginal yeast isolated from women with recurrent candidal vaginitis reveals a higher percentage of non-albicans species of Candida, resistance to imidazoles is rarely responsible for the recurrent or chronic cases. Strain typing of sequential clinical isolates suggests a pattern of vaginal relapse rather than of frequent vaginal reinfection. Attempts to reduce attacks by treating sexual partners and suppressing a putative gastrointestinal tract focus have failed in the past. The results of immunologic studies suggest the possibility of an acquired Candida antigen-specific immunologic deficiency that results in uncontrolled vaginal Candida proliferation and, hence, repeated clinical attacks. The recent report of normal T-lymphocyte suppression of Candida germ tube production and, hence, inhibition of Candida virulence supports the immunologic hypothesis. Moreover, observations of high-frequency, genetically controlled switching colonies of Candida albicans, accompanied by enhanced virulence and invasive potential of the yeast, may provide an explanation for the recurrent nature of candidal vaginitis in certain women.\r"

  ".U": "90012056\r", 
  ".W": "Bacterial vaginosis is a disease that results from massive overgrowth of vaginal bacterial flora. The exact etiology is unknown. The major components of the normal bacterial flora, peroxide-producing lactobacilli, are replaced by non-peroxide-producing lactobacilli, allowing overgrowth of anaerobic and gram-negative aerobic flora. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in \"clue\" cells. Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge within six months if untreated. Serious infectious sequelae are associated with bacterial vaginosis, including salpingitis, abscesses, endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease. There is also a danger to pregnant women because of premature rupture of the membranes and premature labor. Clindamycin and metronidazole are considered effective therapy for the disease. Treatment of sexual partners remains controversial since sexual transmission has not been proven unequivocally.\r"

  ".U": "90012057\r", 
  ".W": "Terconazole belongs to a new chemical class of antifungal agents, the triazoles. It was designed and synthesized to be more active than the imidazoles. The basic mechanism of action of terconazole, inhibition of fungal cytochrome P-450, is similar to that of the imidazoles. However, because of the additional nitrogen atom in the triazole ring and the lipophilic tail, terconazole establishes a firmer and longer-lasting link with the membrane-bound fungal cytochrome P-450. In addition, terconazole is more metabolically stable and less vulnerable to oxidation and conjugation than are the imidazoles. Terconazole has far greater selectively for yeast cytochrome P-450 than for mammalian microsomal cytochrome P-450. The spectrum of terconazole's in vitro activity includes a wide range of pathogenic fungi; in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium, fungicidal activity against all strains of Candida albicans occurred at less than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In a rat model of severe vaginal candidiasis, terconazole was more potent than all the imidazoles tested. The high affinity and selectivity of terconazole for fungal cytochrome P-450 and its potent in vitro and in vivo activity indicate that the drug may well become a significant agent for the treatment of fungal disease.\r"

The results of dose-response studies demonstrated that 80- and 240-mg suppositories and 0.4% cream were the most effective formulations. Data from multicenter studies of pregnant and nonpregnant women in Belgium and Luxembourg indicate that the efficacy of terconazole cream is superior to that of miconazole nitrate cream and clotrimazole cream. Terconazole cream is also more effective than clotrimazole cream in terms of lower relapse rates.\r"

The results of numerous European studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this agent in both cream and suppository form in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Recently, results of short- and long-term analyses in the United States confirmed the efficacy and safety of 0.4% terconazole cream and 80-mg terconazole suppositories. In short-term evaluations (eight to ten days after therapy), 0.4% terconazole cream was as effective as 2.0% miconazole nitrate cream and significantly superior microbiologically in one study. The clinical cure rates with terconazole cream ranged from 87.3% to 95.5% and the microbiologic cure rates, from 76.9% to 91.1%. Thirty- to 35-day microbiologic relapse rates with terconazole cream ranged from 10.4% to 22.2%. In the short-term evaluations of vaginal suppositories the cure rates of 80-mg terconazole suppositories for three days were comparable to those of 100-mg miconazole nitrate suppositories for seven days. The clinical cure rates with 80-mg terconazole suppositories ranged from 90.0% to 92.2% and the microbiologic cure rates, from 80.4% to 85.0%. The 30- to 35-day microbiologic relapse rates of the 80-mg terconazole suppositories ranged from 20.0% to 28.1%. Terconazole cream and suppositories demonstrated an excellent safety profile in all the studies; no life-threatening side effects occurred with any of the regimens. The frequency of common side effects was similar with terconazole and miconazole nitrate formulations.\r"

Several earlier studies indicate that there is an association between hypertension during pregnancy and elevated levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal exposure to alpha-fetoprotein during pregnancy protects women against the subsequent occurrence of breast cancer.\r"

The observed pattern of decrease was compared with three theoretical models. The first (Skipper) assumes that sensitive and resistant populations are present at the beginning of treatment. The second (Goldie and Coldman) assumes an initially sensitive population with mutation causing subsequent treatment resistance. Both models, under a wide range of parameter values, predict a much more rapid decrease in fractional tumor kill per treatment cycle than was observed. A model in which there are four clones of differing sensitivity at the start of treatment was able to adequately describe the observed time course of tumor killing.\r"

The manifestations of abnormal marijuana use may assume many forms. Medical, psychiatric, neurological, traumatic, and sociological sequelae occur commonly in acute and chronic marijuana use. Marijuana dependence must be diagnosed primarily as the etiological or precipitating agent to adequately prevent and treat these conditions. The central role of marijuana addiction can be identified. The consequences of the marijuana addiction should be separated from the marijuana addict's actual motivation or craving to use marijuana. Marijuana addicts use abnormally because of what marijuana does to them and not for them. Marijuana reinforces its own use. Psychosocial stressors are not required to produce a marijuana addiction in biologically susceptible individuals. Consequences that result from an addiction to marijuana do not produce the abnormal use. A presumptive diagnosis of marijuana dependence (addiction) can be established by detecting significant consequences associated with marijuana use. A definitive diagnosis entails confirming the presence of addictive behavior by identifying a preoccupation, compulsivity and relapse relative to the drug, marijuana.\r"

A total of 59 patients with palpable prostate cancer clinically confined to 1 lobe underwent transrectal ultrasound before radical prostatectomy and step-sectioning of the radical prostatectomy specimen. Transrectal ultrasound was performed with 5 or 7 MHz. real-time transrectal units. Pathological findings in these 59 cases revealed no tumor in the contralateral lobe in 34 (58%) and the presence of unsuspected tumor in 25 (42%). Transrectal ultrasound detected 13 of 25 unsuspected cancers for a sensitivity of 52%. Of 34 patients with no contralateral lobe lesion transrectal ultrasound was correct in 23 for a specificity of 68%. The positive and negative predictive values for transrectal ultrasound in this study group were 54 and 66%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the pathological size of the clinically suspected and clinically unsuspected cancers as measured by average largest dimension, and transrectal ultrasound sensitivity did not correlate with the size of the cancer. Based on careful sonopathological analysis, transrectal ultrasound may not be a good method to detect clinically unsuspected prostate cancer and the false positive rate would appear to be high.\r"

Terodiline has the theoretical advantage of being a drug with anticholinergic and calcium channel blocking effects. Theoretically, by using a drug with dual action the beneficial effect of reduced detrusor overactivity might occur at a dosage below that likely to lead to the troublesome side effects experienced by patients who take pure anticholinergic agents. A total of 70 female patients completed a study characterized by extremely strict inclusion criteria and a tight protocol. Other novel elements to the study were the extensive use of urinary diaries for symptom evaluation, standardized urodynamic studies agreed upon by the participating centers and the dose titration design of the trial. Terodiline has been demonstrated to be a safe, well tolerated and effective drug in the treatment of idiopathic detrusor instability. Drug treatment led to significant decreases in urinary frequency and incontinence episodes. Pre-micturition symptoms, such as urgency, were markedly reduced and the voided volume was significantly increased. Although there were consistent trends towards greater improvement in the urodynamic measurements, when the terodiline and placebo groups were compared these did not reach statistical significance, partly due to a large improvement in the placebo group. Nevertheless, terodiline has been shown to be a useful drug for conservative management of patients with detrusor instability.\r"

Bladder instillation of live Escherichia coli (E. coli) resulted in persistent infection and inflammation and also diffuse urothelial hyperplasia. Instillation of killed E. coli also induced diffuse hyperplasia. Hyperplastic changes regressed following withdrawal of the killed E. coli treatment. Urothelial hyperplasia was also induced by repeated instillation of protein-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endotoxin derived from gram-negative bacterial wall component, but not by protein-free LPS. A finding common to bladders showing hyperplasia was the infiltration of neutrophils into intercellular spaces of the urothelium. We conclude that urothelial hyperplasia is induced by E. coli cystitis, that LPS plays a significant role in the hyperplastic response, and that neutrophils may mediate the response.\r"

  ".W": "A portable ultrasound unit has been developed that provides a noninvasive technique to measure urine volume. We assessed the effect of patient position on the accuracy of measurements as well as inter-user reliability and user training. There were 63 ultrasound measurements of urine volume made by a trained and an inexperienced examiner, and the values were compared to true volumes obtained by catheterization in 16 adults with a neurogenic bladder. Subjects were tested in the seated and supine positions. Correlation for ultrasound volumes between the trained and inexperienced examiners was highly significant. Accuracy and precision of the ultrasound measurements were not affected by patient position. Thus, little training is necessary to use this instrument, inter-user reliability is good, and accuracy and precision are clinically acceptable whether patients are in the seated or supine positions.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between T antigen expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin plus interleukin-2 treatment was studied. A total of 25 patients received combined treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 at weekly instillations for 6 consecutive weeks and then monthly for 1 year. T antigen expression in all patients was studied before treatment. Of the patients 16 had positive T antigen expression in the tumors: 13 (81%) remained free of tumor for an average of 28 months, 3 had a noninvasive recurrence each at 8 to 27 months (mean 18 months) and all responded well to a repeated treatment cycle. Nine patients were negative for T antigen: 1 (11%) remained free of tumor for 11 months, while 8 had recurrence within 12 months. Of the latter 8 patients 2 had noninvasive recurrence each at 4 to 5 months but they responded to a repeated treatment cycle and remained free of tumor for 4 to 22 months (mean 13 months), 4 had subsequent repeated recurrences at 12 to 41 months (mean 22 months) and 2 had progression to deep invasion resulting in cystectomy at 11 to 12 months. Thus, the disease-free rate (continuous complete response) in patients with tumors positive for T antigen was 81%, while that in patients with tumors negative for T antigen was 11% (p less than 0.005, chi-square test). The over-all response rate in patients with positive and negative tumors to bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 treatment was 100 and 33%, respectively, and that for the total patients was 76%. T antigen may serve as a target recognition structure for effector cells generated by bacillus Calmette-Guerin plus interleukin-2 treatment. This study suggests that T antigen is useful to predict the response of bladder tumors to treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2.\r"

  ".W": "The duration of deep venous valvular reflux was studied in 192 venous segments of the legs of 32 patients in good health. Three methods were used to elicit reflux in the supine and upright positions--Valsalva's maneuver, proximal limb compression, and release of distal limb compression. Standardized compressions were achieved with pneumatic cuffs. When this approach was used to study valve function, the time to complete closure of the valve and cessation of retrograde flow was found to be shorter than that for conventional methods of closure. The distal cuff deflation method is the only one that permits a quantitative and reproducible method to measure duration of venous reflux at all levels of the lower limb. Normal values obtained with this test are presented for the common femoral, deep femoral, and superficial femoral veins and for the popliteal and posterior tibial veins midway between knee and ankle level and the posterior tibial vein at the ankle. In the popliteal vein, median duration of reflux is 0.19 second; 95% of the values in the popliteal vein are less than 0.66 second. In distal areas, duration of reflux is short and uniform. The advantage of the cuff deflation test over the Valsalva method is that the cuff method is not hindered by the presence of ileofemoral valves. A better understanding of the relative importance of deep valve dysfunction at different levels and the expected benefit of valve repair may be obtained with this test.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 150 published randomized trials on the treatment of lung cancer showed serious methodological drawbacks. Handling of withdrawals (only 7 trials had no dropouts), a priori estimates of sample size (only 9 trials specified the required number of patients), blinding of randomization (only 22 trials had a satisfactory procedure), and information on eligible nonrandomized patients (only 13 studies reported it precisely) were areas of major concern. Although trial quality improved over time both in design/execution (study size estimation and analysis by prognostic factors became more frequent) and reporting (information on patients' characteristics and side effects were more thoroughly reported), their evolution was inconsistent. For non-small-cell lung cancer-despite the persistent lack of proof of efficacy of any active treatment-an untreated control arm was prematurely abandoned and a wide variety of tested regimens prevailed even in better-quality studies. Slightly more promising is the picture for small-cell lung cancer, where research indicates somewhat more reliable-though limited-progress. While clinical research in lung cancer has contributed little to defining the best standard care, we conclude that its heterogeneity makes it unlikely that quantitative meta-analysis of existing trials will be constructive.\r"

We transferred the composite grafts onto limited areas of excised full-thickness burn wounds of four patients with extensive burn injuries. Our results indicate that this composite graft material has acceptable \"take,\" with formation of a basement membrane within 9 days of graft placement.

Doppler techniques allow precise measurements of blood flow velocity at different locations in the heart and great vessels, so that many aspects of hemodynamics can now be measured noninvasively. These techniques are particularly useful for the quantitative assessment of valvular stenosis; both valve areas and transvalvular gradients may be determined. Doppler echocardiography (particularly with color flow mapping) is also useful for the qualitative assessment of valvular regurgitation. By understanding the uses and limitations of Doppler echocardiography, physicians may now confidently follow up patients with mild or moderate valvular disease with serial noninvasive studies, avoiding the risks of cardiac catheterization in many patients.\r"

Immediately after thoracotomy or sternotomy but before tissue dissection, operative scanning enabled delineation and evaluation of the evaluation of the vessels and heart (atrium) behind or within the tumor and detection of regional lymph nodes. The accuracy of operative ultrasound in diagnosing the presence or the extent of cardiovascular invasion was 91.7% (22 of 24 operations), which was significantly (p less than 0.02) higher than preoperative studies (62.5%), including computed tomography and angiography. Of the 24 surgical procedures, 23 were consistent with operations proposed on the basis of operative ultrasound findings, whereas only 16 were consistent with preoperatively proposed (p less than 0.01). Operative ultrasound provided the capability of depicting lymph nodes as small as 3 mm. More lymph nodes (8.0 +/- 1.84 nodes per cancer) were detected with operative ultrasound than with computed tomography (4.8 +/- 1.56 nodes) (p less than 0.001); however, the sensitivity and specificity of operative ultrasound in determining lymph node metastasis were 82.4% and 67.3%, respectively. No liver metastasis was identified. The information provided by operative ultrasound regarding cardiovascular invasion and lymph node and liver metastasis was considered helpful in selecting the type of surgical procedure an in avoiding unnecessary tissue dissection.\r"

These tumors most commonly occur as a single, bulky mass in the hemispheric white matter or the deep gray matter, but multiple tumors occur in approximately a fourth of the patients. The findings on computed tomography are distinctive and nearly pathognomonic. The majority of these tumors are B-cell lymphomas with aggressive histologic changes. Surgical intervention should be reserved for tissue diagnosis because surgical removal does not seem to influence the outcome. Conventional therapy consists of whole-brain irradiation with or without chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with such tumors is grim, the median duration of survival being less than 2 years with conventional therapy and the 5-year survival being less than 5%.\r"

Because of their lower osmolality, these new agents cause fewer undesirable physiologic effects and fewer adverse reactions than do conventional agents after intravascular administration. Unfortunately, the cost of LOCM is substantially higher than the cost of conventional contrast media. Appropriate use of these newer, more expensive contrast agents must be based on a thorough knowledge and understanding of their chemistry, physiologic features, and relative safety. Some questions remain about these new agents. Further studies are needed to determine the nephrotoxicity of LOCM relative to that of conventional agents. In addition, LOCM have less anticoagulant capacity than do the conventional media; therefore, clotting may occur when the LOCM and blood mix in syringes and small catheters. This potential decrease in anticoagulation and its clinical implications should be further investigated. Finally, the mortality rate associated with use of LOCM needs to be determined in future studies in large numbers of patients.\r"

For pregnant women with P falciparum infections who received 25 mg of pyrimethamine weekly for suppressive prophylaxis, 67% (59/88) of in vivo and 60% (6/10) of in vitro tests showed pyrimethamine resistance. A second group of parasitaemic and parasite-free pregnant women was enrolled to evaluate the efficacy of pyrimethamine as a primary tissue schizonticide; after receiving a curative dose of chloroquine (25 mg/kg), half the women were given 25 mg of pyrimethamine weekly and half received no prophylaxis. Parasitologic failure rates did not differ between the pyrimethamine-treated (8/34) and the control (11/37) groups during the 16-week follow-up. Thus, pyrimethamine is not effective for suppressive or causal prophylaxis in pregnant women in Ilorin.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the value of hepatic ultrasonography (US) and scintigraphy (SG) in detecting liver disease in developing countries 425 US scans and 304 SG scans of patients with focal or diffuse liver disease or normal livers were reviewed. The accuracy of both US and SG in distinguishing between normal and diseased livers was low (68% and 74%, respectively). Both techniques did better at detecting focal than diffuse liver disease; the sensitivity of US and SG in focal and diffuse disease was 88% and 92%, and 27% and 54%, respectively. The specificity of both procedures was high for both types of liver disease (91-96%). Overlap between US features of amoebic liver abscess, hepatocellular carcinoma, and metastatic carcinoma resulted in a correct final diagnosis being made in only 81% of patients with amoebic liver abscess, 29% with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 43% of patients with metastatic carcinoma who had a US scan. This study indicates that these techniques are neither accurate in detecting diffuse liver disease nor capable of determining the cause of diffuse liver disease. When diffuse parenchymal liver disease is suspected biopsy would be needed. Although the accuracy of both imaging modalities in detecting focal disease is high, overlap between the US features of the common causes of space-occupying lesions may result in an incorrect final diagnosis in some cases. In consequence, biopsy or aspiration might be required.\r"

Several cases are presented that demonstrate the unique features of innominate artery compression of the trachea: 1. Innominate artery compression can occur in adolescent patients. 2. Flow volume loops are an effective method of documenting airway compromise in this condition. 3. Exercise intolerance should be considered as a relative indication for surgical intervention in these patients. 4. Reimplantation of the innominate artery is a viable surgical alternative in the treatment of affected patients. 5. Telescopic bronchoscopy during surgical correction of this condition will ensure that there has been successful correction of the tracheal compression. 6. Urgent repair is advocated in patients who experience periods of apnea.\r"

An initial complete surgical excision can prevent recurrence of a nasopharyngeal angiofibroma as well as sarcomatous transformation. With the availability of surgical procedures that can completely and safely resect almost all nasopharyngeal angiofibromas, radiation therapy can be avoided.\r"

The finding of an ovarian renin-secreting tumor emphasizes the potential importance of the ovary as an extrarenal source of renin; the local ovarian renin-angiotensin system may play a key role in reproductive function by regulating vascular reactivity, local blood flow, steroidogenesis and other physiologic effects. In the illustrative case presented, a renin-secreting ovarian leiomyosarcoma was obtained from a women who presented with hypertension and hypokalemia. Plasma prorenin levels were markedly elevated. Tumor excision was quickly followed by a fall in prorenin levels and tumor recurrence was accompanied by an increase in prorenin levels. Active renin concentration in the tumor homogenates was similar to that found in kidney homogenates while the tissue prorenin concentration was approximately 20 times that found in kidney tissue. When cultured for up to 4 weeks, ovarian tumor cells secreted greater than 95% prorenin. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that tumor renin had a molecular weight of 47,000, similar to that of human recombinant prorenin. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue with antibodies against human renal renin at the electron microscopic level demonstrated the presence of renin primarily in membrane-bound vesicles and rarely in dense-core secretory granules. These findings suggest that prorenin in this ovarian tumor was secreted by the constitutive pathway, which is mediated by these amorphous vesicles.\r"

  ".U": "90014137\r", 
  ".W": "Acute lung injury induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. Twenty-nine of the 74 patients who received bone marrow transplants at the University of Minnesota during a 1-year period developed evidence of acute lung injury, and RSV was identified as the cause in 8. We discuss the clinical course of these 8 patients and offer a clinical approach to RSV infection occurring after bone marrow transplantation. We also review the immune response to infection with RSV and relate this information to the nature and degree of immunosuppression present in patients undergoing this type of transplantation. We found bronchoalveolar lavage with rapid antigen detection to be particularly useful for the prompt diagnosis of this serious infection. The virus was obtained from the lower respiratory tract of each patient and was identified in lavage effluent by culture and by antigen detection (ELISA). The mean time to a positive culture was 6 days, while detection of antigens of respiratory syncytial virus by ELISA was completed within 18 hours in all cases. The clinical progression of the illness in immunocompromised patients appears to be the same as in non-immunocompromised persons: upper respiratory tract infection and illness precede lower respiratory tract infection and acute lung injury. Seven of our 8 patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms or abnormal sinus radiographs, and upper respiratory specimens (cultures and ELISA from nasopharynx, throat, and sputum) were positive in 5 of 8 patients. Six patients developed RSV-induced lung injury before marrow engraftment; 4 of them had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and died, including 3 in whom RSV was eliminated from the lower respiratory tract following treatment with ribavirin aerosol. Two additional pre-engraftment patients had only relatively mild lung injury 4 days after beginning treatment with ribavirin for RSV infection in the upper respiratory tract. Their recovery suggests that early treatment may ameliorate RSV-induced lung injury. The remaining 2 patients developed lung injury after marrow engraftment. Both of these patients had clear chest radiographs, responded clinically to ribavirin, and survived. RSV is a potentially treatable cause of life-threatening lung injury, if the physician is aggressive in identifying the virus in the upper respiratory tract before evidence of lung injury appears. Rapid detection methods are essential when bone marrow transplant patients have fever along with signs, symptoms, or radiographic indications of nasal or sinus disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cumulative patient survival was 90%, 86% and 75% at 1, 2 and 3 years, and survival of patients using this technique was 75%, 62% and 40% at corresponding time intervals with no difference demonstrated in diabetic patients or in those older than 50 years. Biochemical and hematologic parameters were well maintained with peritoneal creatinine clearance increasing and peritoneal protein loss remaining stable with ongoing CAPD. Loss of ultrafiltration, however, accounted for 17.7% of permanent transfers to alternative therapy. Low serum albumin and elevated serum triglyceride concentrations correlated with mortality, whereas low serum albumin, low cholesterol, and high phosphate levels correlated with morbidity as assessed by frequency of hospital admissions. Dietary protein intake assessed by urea generation rate was significantly lower than that estimated from a 24-hour dietary recall (0.82 vs. 1.02 g/kg/day, p less than 0.01) and with the exception of body mass index and serum albumin, anthropometric and visceral protein measurements showed few correlations with nutritional adequacy. Bacterial peritonitis remained the major complication, although fungal infections made a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality. Overall, CAPD is confirmed to be a satisfactory form of dialysis for all forms of end-stage renal failure and an integral part of any renal replacement program. However, nutritional adequacy and lowering of complication rates require further investigation.\r"

  ".U": "90014140\r", 
  ".W": "Unstable hemoglobins account for approximately one fifth of the abnormal hemoglobins identified to date. Clinical expression ranges from a continuing and severe hemolytic anemia which may or may not be abated by splenectomy to a compensated hemolytic state with exacerbations of hemolysis after exposure to drugs or during febrile episodes. Other clinical indicators of the disorder include the voiding of urine darkened by the presence of dipyrroles, as well as intermittent episodes of scleral icterus. Recognition and definition of the unstable hemoglobins can be difficult. Approximately one third are spontaneous mutations; many are neutral substitutions, so that routine electrophoretic methods are of limited value; and in some the molecule is so unstable that it is lost during preparative techniques employed for its identification. Most informative are those methods designed to demonstrate the instability of the molecule, including the exposure of red cells or hemolysate to heat, redox dyes, or isopropanol. Each of these tests is easily performed and should be employed in the evaluation of any patient with an unexplained hemolytic disorder, and especially in those patients with drug-or hyperthermic-induced hemolysis. A review of red cell indices of our patients, together with those reported in the literature, indicates the subjects with moderate to severe forms of the unstable hemoglobinopathies have macrocytosis with abnormally low MCHCs. Incubating normal or Hb Zurich red cells in vitro at 37 degrees and 41 degrees C effects similar changes in the red cells, the phenomenon occurring more rapidly in Hb Zurich than in normal cells. The phenotypic expression of the unstable hemoglobinopathies may be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, including smoking, pyrexia, exposure to oxidants, and the presence or absence of splenic function. Especially noteworthy is the effect of smoking on the clinical and laboratory findings in subjects with Hb Zurich. As a result of the 65-fold increase in the affinity of the abnormal beta-globin chain of Hb Zurich for CO, the molecule is stabilized, followed by resistance to oxidative injury, a decreased rate of hemolysis, and a marked increase in oxygen affinity.\r"

  ".W": "Although prednisone has been used to treat patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, its efficacy has not been rigorously studied. We therefore randomly assigned 102 patients to either treatment with prednisone (60 mg per day) or a control group. At three months, improvement, defined prospectively as an increase in the ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 5 percentage points, was observed in 53 percent of the patients receiving prednisone and 27 percent of the controls (P = 0.005). The mean (+/- SE) ejection fraction increased 4.3 +/- 1.5 percentage points (from 17.9 +/- 1.0 to 22.2 +/- 1.6 percent) in the prednisone group, as compared with 2.1 +/- 0.8 percentage points (from 17.1 +/- 1.1 to 19.3 +/- 1.4 percent) in the control group (P = 0.054). All patients were categorized prospectively in two separately randomized subgroups. \"Reactive\" patients (n = 60) were those who had fibroblastic (n = 36) or lymphocytic (n = 2) infiltration or immunoglobulin deposition (n = 16) on endomyocardial biopsy, a positive gallium scan (n = 7), or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n = 18). \"Nonreactive\" patients (n = 42) had none of these features. At three months, 67 percent of the reactive patients who received prednisone had improvement, as compared with 28 percent of the reactive controls (P = 0.004). Nonreactive patients did not improve significantly with prednisone (P = 0.51). After three months, reactive patients who received prednisone daily were switched to alternate-day therapy (60 mg every other day), and after six months the improvement seen earlier was no longer present. These data suggest that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may have some improvement when given a high dose of prednisone daily. However, the increases in the ejection fraction that we observed during prednisone treatment were small, their duration was limited, and the side effects were important. Overall, prednisone was judged to have only marginal clinical benefit, and should not be administered as standard therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Blacks are more likely to have hypertension, have lower levels of plasma renin activity, and typically consume less potassium than whites. Whether blacks and whites secrete different amounts of aldosterone is less clear. We estimated aldosterone secretion indirectly in 715 children, 249 of whom were black, by measuring their nocturnal rates of urinary excretion of aldosterone. Dietary sodium and potassium intakes were estimated from their excretion rates. The mean (+/- SE) aldosterone-excretion rate was lower in the black children than in the white children (0.045 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.078 +/- 0.004 nmol per micromole of creatinine per kilogram of body weight; P less than 0.001). The potassium-excretion rate was also lower in the black children than in the white children (0.13 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.01 mmol per micromole of creatinine per kilogram; P less than 0.001). Aldosterone excretion was highly correlated with potassium excretion (P less than 0.001), but the lower aldosterone-excretion rate in blacks was explained only in part by their lower dietary intake of potassium. Systolic blood pressure was higher in black children (P less than 0.001), as was diastolic pressure (P = 0.037). In a second study of 99 children, the plasma aldosterone level was found to be significantly lower in black children than in white children (230 +/- 30 vs. 400 +/- 30 pmol per liter; P less than 0.001). Plasma renin activity and plasma cortisol levels were the same in both groups. In summary, we found that black children secrete about 40 percent less aldosterone than white children. The role of the lower aldosterone-secretion rate in the genesis of the higher blood pressures observed in black children is not known.\r"

  ".W": "To study whether the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin increases the amount of autologous blood that can be collected before surgery, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of erythropoietin in 47 adults scheduled for elective orthopedic procedures. The patients received either erythropoietin (600 units per kilogram of body weight) or placebo intravenously twice a week for 21 days, during which time up to 6 units of blood was collected. Patients were excluded from donation when their hematocrit values were less than 34 percent. All patients received iron sulfate (325 mg orally three times daily). The mean number of units collected per patient (+/- SE) was 5.4 +/- 0.2 for the erythropoietin group and 4.1 +/- 0.2 for the placebo group. The mean red-cell volume donated by the patients who received erythropoietin was 41 percent greater than that donated by the patients who received placebo (961 vs. 683 ml, P less than 0.05). Only 1 of the 23 patients treated with erythropoietin was unable to donate greater than or equal to 4 units (4 percent) as compared with 7 of the 24 patients who received placebo (29 percent). No adverse effects were attributed to erythropoietin. We conclude that recombinant human erythropoietin increases the ability of patients about to undergo elective surgery to donate autologous blood.\r"

Adjusted rates of discharge, readmission, length of stay, and reimbursement were 47, 29, 15, and 79 percent higher, respectively, in Boston; 40 percent of Boston's deaths occurred in hospitals as compared with 32 percent of New Haven's. High-variation medical conditions (those for which there is little consensus about the need for hospitalization) accounted for most of these differences. By contrast, discharge rates for low-variation medical conditions (which tend to reflect the incidence of disease) were similar. Inpatient case-fatality rates were lower in Boston than in New Haven (RR = 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.92), but when all deaths (regardless of place of death) were measured, the mortality rates in Boston and New Haven were nearly identical (RR = 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.05). We conclude that the lower rate of hospital use by Medicare enrollees in New Haven was not associated with a higher overall mortality rate. Population-based as well as hospital-based statistics are needed to evaluate differences in hospital mortality rates for high-variation medical conditions.\r"

  ".U": "90015051\r", 
  ".W": "Guidelines for medical practice can contribute to improved care only if they succeed in moving actual practice closer to the behaviors the guidelines recommend. To assess the effect of such guidelines, we surveyed hospitals and obstetricians in Ontario before and after the release of a widely distributed and nationally endorsed consensus statement recommending decreases in the use of cesarean sections. These surveys, along with discharge data from hospitals reflecting actual practice, revealed that most obstetricians (87 to 94 percent) were aware of the guidelines and that most (82.5 to 85 percent) agreed with them. Attitudes toward the use of cesarean section were congruent with the recommendations even before their release. One third of the hospitals and obstetricians reported changing their practice as a consequence of the guidelines, and obstetricians reported rates of cesarean section in women with a previous cesarean section that were significantly reduced, in keeping with the recommendations (from 72.2 percent to 61.1 percent; P less than 0.01). The surveys also showed, however, that knowledge of the content of the recommendations was poor (67 percent correct responses). Furthermore, data on actual practice after the publication of the guidelines showed that the rates of cesarean section were 15 to 49 percent higher than the rates reported by obstetricians, and they showed only a slight change from the previous upward trend. We conclude that guidelines for practice may predispose physicians to consider changing their behavior, but that unless there are other incentives or the removal of disincentives, guidelines may be unlikely to effect rapid change in actual practice. We believe that incentives should operate at the local level, although they may include system-wide economic changes.\r"

  ".W": "Protective immunity against malaria is induced by vaccination of hosts with irradiation-attenuated sporozoites. This immunity is mediated in part by neutralizing antibodies that are directed mainly against the repeat domain of the circumsporozoite protein. Early experiments showed, however, that B-cell-depleted mice that are immunized with sporozoites can resist challenge, indicating that T-cell effector mechanisms may also have a role in protection. This idea was supported by the recent observation that protective immunity also requires T-cells expressing the CD8 antigen (CD8+ T cells) whose target is probably the developing liver-stage parasites. Moreover, an oral Salmonella vaccine that expresses the circumsporozoite protein is able to protect against murine malaria in the absence of antibodies. Here we report the identification of an epitope contained within amino acids 249-260 of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein that is recognized by H-2Kd-restricted cytotoxic T cells. Passive transfer into mice of cytotoxic-T-cell clones that recognize this epitope conferred a high degree of protection against challenge. These results provide the first direct evidence that CD8+ T cells that are specific for a defined epitope can confer protection against a parasitic infection.\r"

  ".W": "The rex gene of the type I human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-I) encodes a phosphorylated nuclear protein of relative molecular mass 27,000 which is required for viral replication. The Rex protein acts by promoting the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced viral messenger RNAs that encode the virion structural proteins. To identify the biologically important peptide domains within Rex, we introduced a series of mutations throughout its sequence. Two distinct classes of mutations lacking Rex biological activity were identified. One class corresponds to trans-dominant repressors as they inhibit the function of the wild-type Rex protein. The second class of mutants, in contrast, are recessive negative, rather than dominant negative, as they are not appropriately targeted to the cell nucleus. These results indicate the presence of at least two functionally distinct domains within the Rex protein, one involved in protein localization and a second involved in effector function. The trans-dominant Rex mutants may represent a promising new class of anti-viral agents.\r"

  ".W": "Positively charged amino acids have been shown to be important elements in targeting-peptides that direct proteins into mitochondria, nuclei, and the secretory pathways of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The 'positive-inside' rule, which observes that regions of polytopic (multi-spanning) membrane proteins facing the cytoplasm are generally enriched in arginyl and lysyl residues whereas translocated regions are largely devoid of these residues, implies that the distribution of positively charged amino acids may also be a major determinant of the transmembrane topology of integral membrane proteins. If this is indeed the case, it should be possible to predictably alter the topology of a polytopic protein by site-directed insertions and/or deletions of positively charged residues in critical locations. I now describe a derivative of Escherichia coli leader peptidase, a polytopic inner-membrane protein, that switches from sec-gene-dependent membrane insertion with a Nout-Cout transmembrane topology to sec-gene-independent insertion with a Nin-Cin topology in response to the addition of four positively charged lysines to its N terminus.\r"

  ".W": "Responses to light are transmitted from photoreceptors to second-order retinal neurons by chemical synapses that may use an excitatory amino acid (EAA) as the neurotransmitter. This hypothesis is based primarily on the pharmacological actions of EAA agonists and antagonists on the membrane potentials and light responses of second-order neurons. But the release of endogenous EAAs, which is a critical criterion for the identification of EAAs as transmitters, has not been demonstrated. Here we report the use of outside-out membrane patches excised from rat hippocampal neurons to detect the release of EAAs from synaptic terminals of isolated turtle photoreceptors. Electrical stimulation of or application of lanthanum chloride to photoreceptors induced an increase in the frequency of opening of 50-pS channels in the patches. These channels were identified as the class of glutamate-activated channels that are also gated by aspartate and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). In several photoreceptor-patch pairs, spontaneous channel activity was observed near the synaptic terminals. These results provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that both rods and cones of the turtle use an EAA as their neurotransmitter.\r"

We find, however, that isolated VH domains with good antigen-binding affinities can also be prepared. Using the polymerase chain reaction, diverse libraries of VH genes were cloned from the spleen genomic DNA of mice immunized with either lysozyme or keyhole-limpet haemocyanin. From these libraries, VH domains were expressed and secreted from Escherichia coli. Binding activities were detected against both antigens, and two VH domains were characterized with affinities for lysozyme in the 20 nM range. Isolated variable domains may offer an alternative to monoclonal antibodies and serve as the key to building high-affinity human antibodies. We suggest the name 'single domain antibodies (dAbs)' for these antigen binding demands.\r"
