All 16 unequivocal mesotheliomas reacted with the antibody, whereas none of the 31 lung carcinomas did, thus confirming the high specificity and the high sensitivity of the antibody. Furthermore, 20 cases of serous membranes tumor, in which major diagnostic disagreement was present when reviewed by the members of the Commission of the European Communities Mesothelioma Panel, were examined. Sixteen of the 20 cases were immunoreactive to the antimesothelial cell antibody, thus establishing their mesothelial origin. Given conventionally fixed and processed tissues, it appears that this antibody may be used as an appropriate diagnostic adjunct to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of mesothelioma.\r"

AML was documented by the presence of circulating blast cells and 50% blasts with myeloid markers and Auer rods in the bone marrow. A complete remission from both forms of leukemia was obtained after treatment for the AML. The patient also experienced the temporal occurrence of venous thrombosis for the first time at the age of 69 years, shortly before the diagnosis of leukemia. Protein C deficiency was documented and may have been hereditary as suggested by the strong family history of thrombosis or alternatively may have been the consequence of one of the leukemias.\r"

All lesions were graded according to the systems proposed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC), and a correlation was found between tumor grade and prognosis. Univariate analysis selected the following variables as unfavorable prognostic factors: invasive tumor margins, extra-compartmental status, deep tumors, tumor diameters over 5 cm, inadequate excision, presence of necrosis, high mitotic count, histologically undifferentiated tumors, and blood vessel invasion. These variables were found to be interdependent. Multivariate analysis selected quality of surgery as the most important variable for predicting local recurrences. The factors selected with regard to overall and metastasis-free survival were tumor size, tumor margins, necrosis, and adequacy of excision. These results permitted classification of patients into four prognostic groups: two with good and two with bad prognosis. Five-year survival for the four groups was 100%, 83%, 53%, and 0%; 5-year metastatic rates were 0%, 12%, 67%, and 100%. Similar groups were obtained when the variables of tumor margins and size were combined with an adaptation of the NCI grading (low-grade tumors/high-grade tumors without necrosis/high-grade tumors with necrosis). Comparative analysis showed that patients with tumors of the same histologic grade or type were not necessarily classed in the same prognostic groups. A better clinicopathologic correlation was obtained using a combination of prognostic factors than with histologic grading or typing alone.\r"

After a mean follow-up of 90.5 +/- 59.1 months (range 16-261), 3 patients were in chronic dialysis (18.7%), 8 other patients had renal function deterioration (50%), with creatinine clearance ranging from 31 to 60 ml/min. Four other patients had mild urinary abnormalities with normal plasma creatinine (25%) and only 1 patient was in complete clinical remission (6%). No clinical features at onset were predictive for the clinical outcome of the disease, while in the biopsies the percentage of crescents was higher in patients who developed renal insufficiency. High IgA serum levels were correlated (p = 0.0242) with a favorable course. It is concluded that Schonlein-Henoch nephritis of the adult carries a high long-term risk of renal dysfunction.\r"

This study was designed to determine the acute hemodynamic effects of this agent in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Twenty-six patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35%, cardiac indexes less than 2.1 L/min/m2, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures greater than 12 mm Hg were given 2 or 5 mg benazepril hydrochloride. All does produced significant (p less than 0.05) increases in cardiac output (26.7% to 31.6% above control) and heart rate (5.4% to 11.2% above control) and decreases in systemic (27.1% to 32.0% below control) and pulmonary (34.8% to 55.5% below control) vascular resistances, mean pulmonary (25.3% to 30.3% below control) and systemic (13.4% to 18.5% below control) arterial pressures, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (46.9% to 51.1% below control). Twenty-four hours after an initial dose, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery wedge pressures remained below control levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity fell by 67.8% +/- 6.4%, with a 15.8% +/- 7.6% decline in aldosterone levels. Thus benazepril hydrochloride is an effective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that produces hemodynamic effects that persist for 24 hours after a single oral dose.\r"

In five patients, cardiac output was also obtained by the thermodilution technique. As PEEP was increased, IVC dimensions increased during both inspiration and expiration, and the IVC collapsibility index decreased. This indicated an increase in venous stasis and decrease in venous return to the right atrium. Increasing PEEP was associated with progressive decreases in cardiac output, and length and septal-lateral dimensions of both ventricles. The decreased cardiac output during IPPV with 10 and 15 cm H2O PEEP may be due to the decreased venous return and ventricular filling. Cardiac output determined by echocardiography was correlated closely to that by the thermodilution technique.\r"

PEEP (9.2 +/- 0.5 cm H2O) was added to six animals to decrease venous admixture (Qsp/Qt) from 50.6 +/- 4.4% to 16.0 +/- 1.3% (p less than .05). With PEEP, intrapulmonary blood flow distribution (assessed by radioactive microspheres) decreased significantly to nondependent lung regions while increasing to dependent regions. In six other animals, zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) did not alter intrapulmonary blood flow distribution. SNP was then administered to increase cardiac output by 40% (to 2.60 +/- 0.21 L/min in the ZEEP group and to 1.75 +/- 0.27 L/min in the PEEP group). SNP produced no adverse effects on Qsp/Qt or intrapulmonary blood flow distribution. Specifically, SNP did not preferentially dilate pulmonary vessels injured by oleic acid with or without end-expiratory pressure. Thus, administration of a vasodilator drug in asymmetric pulmonary edema appears well tolerated.\r"

In this study, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) technique was used to analyze cellular and eicosanoid composition of the lavage fluid of endotoxin-protected oxygen-exposed rats. The BAL fluid of the endotoxin-protected oxygen-exposed rats contained the highest number of PMN, while the BAL fluid of the nonprotected oxygen-exposed rats contained the highest number of macrophages. Thus, morbidity due to pulmonary oxygen toxicity was correlated with the number of macrophages but not with the number of PMN present in the BAL fluid. Leukotriene B4, thromboxane B2, and prostaglandin E2 levels were significantly higher in the lavage fluid of nonprotected oxygen-exposed rats compared to the levels in the lavage fluid of air-exposed rats. Eicosanoid levels in the BAL fluid of endotoxin-protected oxygen-exposed rats did not differ significantly from the levels found in air-exposed control rats. These findings suggest that endotoxin protects against hyperoxia-induced changes in eicosanoid metabolism.\r"

The pulmonary mechanics of these patients can change rapidly with potential for a negative impact on oxygenation. In an effort to address these problems, we designed a system with a three-way valve that permits the patient to be switched from the ventilator to a data collection system for the assessment of changes in the disease state. The short periods required for data collection (20 to 30 sec) do not interfere with patient care and are well within the limits of safety. A unique feature of the valved system is that it serves to maintain positive airway pressure during data collection. Tests show that, within the frequency range of interest, the mechanics of the measurement system are not altered by the DC pressures applied to the speaker and the valve itself does not contribute significantly to the serial impedance of the system.\r"

While current investigations are difficult to compare due to their lack of standardization, our understanding of the pathophysiology of CNS ischemia has been greatly increased. Ion fluxes, especially K and Ca, may contribute to injury by initiating a cascade of events culminating in free fatty acid, prostaglandin, and free radical formation, with their related pathogenetic potential. Treatment measures currently consist of CPR (although disagreement exists as to which form of CPR), standard supportive measures, and attention to intracranial pressure control. There is some experimental evidence to support the use of calcium channel-blockers, phenytoin, prostaglandin inhibitors, and free-radical scavengers or inhibitors; however, no human trials have been performed. Steroids and barbiturates have been investigated in human trials and do not appear to be efficacious in ameliorating CNS injury after cardiac arrest.\r"

Conversely, none of the noncoughers disclosed bronchial hyperreactivity. Eight of the nine coughers were rechallenged two to six months following cessation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Six of these eight showed persistent bronchial hyperreactivity. We conclude that cough is associated with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with underlying bronchial hyperreactivity.

Recurrent episodes of dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis were the primary clinical signs, mainly in young men, appearing 3.6 years after the first manifestation of Behcet's syndrome. Fever, elevated ESR, and anemia were common, and chest x-ray films showed pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, and prominent pulmonary arteries. Ventilation-perfusion scans showed perfusion defects even when chest x-ray films were normal. Pulmonary artery aneurysms were seen in 7/13 in whom angiography was done. Of 42 patients, 16 died, 15 from fatal pulmonary hemorrhage, 80 percent within two years from the development of pulmonary disease. Histopathologic study results showed vasculitis of pulmonary vessels of various sizes, leading to thrombosis, destruction of the elastic laminae, aneurysms, and arteriobronchial fistula. In addition, pulmonary emboli and the aphthous lesion of the tracheobronchial tree may aid the clinical picture. Anticoagulant therapy may be hazardous in patients with aneurysmal dilatation of the pulmonary vascular tree, and the beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy is discussed. Pulmonary vasculitis in Behcet's syndrome is a unique clinical and pathologic picture, differing from other vasculitides affecting the lung, presents a major threat to the patient's life.\r"

The reaction pattern of mesothelioma cells was found to be CEA negative, Leu M1 negative, EMA positive, BMA-120 positive, My 4 positive, and BA-2 positive. The surface morphology of mesothelioma cells may be of additional help for diagnosis. By these markers, the distinction between mesotheliomas and carcinomas is facilitated. The differentiation of reactive benign mesothelial hyperplasia from malignant mesothelioma by surface marker staining is not yet possible, however. In many effusions in this study, a concomitant T-lymphocytosis was observed with a non-specific increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio, as known for other pleural diseases.\r"

The pleural fluid NSE level was elevated in nine of 12 (75 percent) patients with SCLC. However, only two of 37 (5 percent) patients with NSCLC and two of 39 (5 percent) patients with tuberculous pleurisy had an elevated pleural fluid NSE level. Moreover, none of ten SCLC patients with cytology-negative pleural effusions showed elevated pleural fluid NSE level. Thus, determination of pleural fluid NSE levels seems to be an effective means to differentiate carcinomatous pleurisy due to SCLC from that due to NSCLC, tuberculous pleurisy and cytology-negative pleural effusion in SCLC.\r"

AIDS patients who require intensive care have a poor prognosis; the in-hospital mortality rate of those receiving mechanical ventilation for P carinii pneumonia is 86-100 percent in most studies. However, in the past year, two studies documenting improved outcome have been published. Physicians should understand these outcome data and use well-established ethical principles to allow informed competent patients with AIDS to express their preferences regarding intensive care. Patients should be encouraged to provide advanced directives regarding life-sustaining treatments or to designate surrogate decision-makers to be consulted should they lose mental competence. The health care system should provide alternatives to the ICU for compassionate terminal care. However, arbitrary policies denying intensive care to AIDS patients for whom it is medically indicated and desired are not warranted.\r"

  ".W": "As humans have become more mechanized, the number of persons sustaining spinal cord injuries resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia has increased. Because colorectal function is modulated by a combination of neural, hormonal, and luminal influences, many of the normal regulatory mechanisms remain intact in patients with spinal cord injuries. Management of these patients, however, requires an understanding of altered function in the denervated hindgut. The foregut and midgut are innervated by parasympathetic fibers in the vagus and sympathetic fibers from the lower six thoracic vertebra. In contrast, the hindgut is innervated by parasympathetic fibers arising from the sacral plexus and sympathetic fibers from the lumbar spinal column. Consequently, in most spinal cord injuries, the foregut and midgut remain normally innervated whereas the hindgut looses input from cerebral and spinal cord sources. In high cord lesions this results in decreased colonic motility. In low cord injuries there is loss of inhibitory influences that normally down-regulate left colonic and rectosigmoid sphincter activity. This increased motility causes a loss of left colonic compliance and increases left colonic transit, thus leading to chronic constipation. At the same time in both high and low cord injuries, reflex activity of the anorectum is left unregulated by cerebral input. Once stimulated by distention, the rectum spontaneously evacuates its contents. Thus, fecal impaction and incontinence in these patients principally results from loss of inhibitory influences on rectosigmoid sphincter activity and on rectal reflex activity.\r"

We have studied diagnostic significance of serum IGF-II in chronic liver diseases using specific enzyme immunoassay. Serum IGF-II levels (mean +/- SE) were decreased in chronic hepatitis (538 +/- 51 ng/ml; N = 29), liver cirrhosis (427 +/- 45; 50) and PHC (260 +/- 41; 17) compared to controls (830 +/- 49; 57). Serum IGF-II was not different from controls in any of nonhepatic diseases such as diabetes (1032 +/- 97; 19) pancreatic cancer (1413 +/- 282; 8), chronic pancreatitis (999 +/- 126; 17), peptic ulcer (1186 +/- 43; 11), irritable bowel syndrome (1002 +/- 109; 12), gastrointestinal tract cancer (1250 +/- 216; 21) and chronic renal failure (733 +/- 135; 14). In liver diseases serum IGF-II showed a significant correlation with liver function test (negative with retention of indocyanine green and total bile acids; positive with albumin, thrombo-test, and cholinesterase). These results suggest that serum IGF-II reflects a reduced production of IGF-II in the liver and that it can be an index for the residual capacity of liver function.\r"

Patients with normal endoscopic findings were randomly assigned to receive either ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or placebo for eight weeks, along with either ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac, or piroxicam. Duodenal damage was significantly less in the ranitidine group compared with the placebo group by weeks 4 and 8 (P less than or equal to 0.01). Duodenal ulcers did not develop in any patients on ranitidine (0/57) compared with 4/49 patients (8%) on placebo (P = 0.02). No significant difference was found between treatment groups with respect to gastric damage; 6/60 (10%) in the ranitidine group compared with 6/50 (12%) in the placebo group developed gastric ulcers. These findings suggest that acid suppression is of greater importance for mucosal protection in the duodenum than in the stomach, where other defense mechanisms may be operative. While ranitidine is an effective prophylaxis for NSAID-induced damage in the duodenum, further studies are needed to define specific risk groups and to assess the potential usefulness of more complete acid suppression in preventing gastric mucosal damage.\r"

Intravenous injections of L-364,718 (20 nmol/kg) significantly inhibited pancreatic protein and enzyme responses by food (33% inhibition) but not juice volume output. Both rapid and secondary prolonged postprandial rises of plasma PP were also significantly suppressed by L-364,718 (50% inhibition); however, plasma levels of insulin were not altered. Postprandial levels of gastrin were not affected by L-364,718 administration, whereas 3-hr integrated CCK response was significantly enhanced by L-364,718. This study indicates that L-364,718 inhibits pancreatic protein and enzyme secretion and the release of pancreatic polypeptide stimulated by food in conscious dogs. This inhibition might be due to the selective blockage of receptor binding of circulating CCK molecules. The results suggest that L-364,718 may be useful for the physiological and pathophysiological studies associated with CCK.\r"

We review the published experience with the long acting synthetic somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 in patients with islet cell tumors. Fifteen of 18 patients with vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing tumors, 8 of 8 patients with glucagonomas, 7 of 7 patients with unresectable insulinomas, and 3 of 3 patients with growth hormone releasing factor-producing tumors had a good sustained symptomatic response to SMS 201-995. Patients with benign insulinomas responded variably and are best treated by surgery. Patients with gastrinomas are best treated by oral gastric antisecretory agents. In all these syndromes, the clinical response to SMS 201-995 did not necessarily parallel the change in plasma concentration of marker peptide, suggesting that SMS 201-995 may have actions at various sites. The effect of SMS 201-995 on tumor size has been assessed in 46 patients, less than 20% of whom showed a reduction in tumor size. Side effects have been mild, but include steatorrhea and gastrointestinal disturbances. More studies will be required to fully assess the effects of long-term administration of SMS 201-995.\r"

One of the most important characteristics of somatostatin is that its splanchnic effect is not accompanied by major systemic hemodynamic effects. Somatostatin has been used in several controlled trials to test its potential in controlling acute variceal bleeding. The results remain controversial. Different findings in existing clinical trials may derive in part from distinct protocols for somatostatin administration. Published trials suggest that somatostatin may be as effective as vasopressin in the acute management of variceal bleeding. However, since the efficacy of vasopressin has been questioned, a comparison of two potentially ineffective drugs cannot establish definitively the efficacy of somatostatin in controlling variceal bleeding. The most significant finding of the two published studies has been the lower incidence of minor and major complications with somatostatin when compared to vasopressin. Newer trials in progress may shed new light into the potential use of somatostatin for the treatment of variceal bleeding.\r"

Release of somatostatin from D cells in the gut is regulated by mechanisms that are both dependent on and independent of cAMP. In most cases somatostatin acts to inhibit the function of its target cells. It performs this action in part via pertussis-toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that regulate adenylate cyclase activity. Other mechanisms may involve sites of action distal to intracellular second messenger systems.\r"

Endometriotic implants contained specific ER and PgR in both glandular epithelium and stroma. In contrast to intrauterine endometrium, receptor content among implants was noted to be more heterogeneous, and did not undergo predictable changes in response to endogenous hormones. In the endometriotic implants of patients treated with hormonal therapy, there were significant decreases in ER and PgR in both the glands and stroma relative to untreated patients. These data imply that endometriosis is unpredictable in its response to the cyclic hormonal milieu in terms of ER and PgR, but retains the ability to respond to hormonal suppression over a prolonged interval.\r"

  ".W": "Granulosa cells perform an essential role in ovarian follicle and ovum development. Proliferating cells have an absolute requirement for iron, which is delivered by transferrin with subsequent intracellular transport via the transferrin receptor. Because iron and transferrin concentration increase in follicular fluid with advancing follicular maturation, the authors studied the distribution of transferrin and its receptor in rat and human granulosa cells with light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. Intense cytoplasmic staining was found in granulosa cells, with immunostaining enhancement occurring with advanced follicle maturation, including the periovulatory period. Immunoelectron microscopy showed transferrin throughout the cytoplasm, often in proximity to polyribosomes and vesicular structures. When transferrin was absent in the culture medium used to maintain granulosa cells, diminished transferrin immunostaining was seen. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that follicular maturation is closely related to high levels of cellular transferrin and transferrin receptor. Acquisition of transferrin occurs primarily by either ultrafiltration or facilitated diffusion, whereas de novo local synthesis does not have a major role.\r"

Toward the day of embryo transfer, a marked increase of the diastolic blood flow velocity was observed. In patients with high endocrine response, the pulsatility index (PI) was significantly lower compared with that of patients with low endocrine response. The technique of transvaginal pulsed Doppler measurements offers the possibility to study the alterations of the ovarian blood flow under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions.\r"

The presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the surface membrane and/or within the cytoplasm of each cell also was determined using a horseradish peroxidase immunocytochemical procedure. Based on morphometric characteristics, follicular cells were classified as granulosa or luteal. Granulosa cells were less than 75 micron 2 in area with a C/N of approximately 0.5. Luteal cells were classified as small (less than 75 micron 2, C/N approximately 1.5), midluteal (76 to 100 micron 2, C/N greater than 1.5) and large luteal (greater than 100 micron 2, C/N greater than 1.5). Compared with aspirates from follicles containing fertilizable oocytes, aspirates from follicles with nonfertilizable oocytes had fewer granulosa cells and more large luteal cells. HCG was localized on the membranes of granulosa and small luteal cells and within the cytoplasm of midluteal cells. Human chorionic gonadotropin was generally not observed on either the membranes or cytoplasm of luteal cells over 120 micron 2. These data support the concept that granulosa cells bind hCG to membrane receptors, internalize hCG, and begin to luteinize in response to hCG stimulation. Since the aspirates from follicles containing nonfertilizable oocytes possessed a higher percentage of large luteal cells, it is postulated that the cells from these aspirates began the luteinization process earlier than those from follicles containing fertilizable oocytes.\r"

We used echo endoscopes with a 7.5 or 10.0 MHz radial-scan transducer made by Olympus Co. Ltd. EUS was carried out on 80 patients with SMTs of the stomach including 54 cases confirmed histologically (24 cases of leiomyoma, 3 of leiomyosarcoma, 12 of cysts, 7 of aberrant pancreas, 4 of lipoma, 2 of carcinoid, and 3 of other diseases). Fifty-nine patients with extraluminal compression were detected by endoscopy and/or x-ray examination. We examined the effectiveness of EUS based on our analysis of the gastrointestinal tract wall seen in the EUS image as a five-layered structure corresponding with that of the histological layers. As a result, SMTs and extragastric compression were easily distinguishable in the EUS images of the lesions. The size, location, and origin of the SMTs could be detected. From the location of the SMT in the five-layered structure seen in the EUS image we could predict its histological nature. Thus, EUS was a most valuable method not only in the diagnosis of intramural and extramural SMTs but also in the detection of extragastric compressive lesions and organs.\r"

Blood flow was measured from gastric serosal vessels (average diameter, 1.6 mm) severed immediately after, 24 hours after, and 48 hours after ethanol injection. Blood flow from severed colonic serosal vessels (averaging diameter, 1.0 mm) was measured before and immediately after ethanol injection. The safety of ethanol injection was tested by endoscopically guided submucosal injections which were sequentially observed by endoscopy at 1 hour, 24 hours, and weekly for 4 weeks after injection. Ethanol injection had no effect on bleeding from larger gastric vessels unless the injection was made 24 or 48 hours prior to vessel severence. Ethanol injection was effective in reducing bleeding from the smaller colonic vessels when done immediately prior to vessel severence. Gastric submucosal injections led to ulcers which extended into the muscle layer at 1 week and were completely healed by 3 weeks; none perforated or bled. These data support the potential efficacy of therapeutic ethanol injection for the control of small vessel (1.0 mm in diameter) bleeding and the potential prophylactic value against rebleeding from larger vessels. Further studies are needed to determine whether these findings are organ related as opposed to being diameter specific.\r"

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method for simultaneous measurement of gall bladder storage of a cholephilic drug, and of its duodenal excretion and t1/2 in bile. Duodenal perfusion using polyethylene glycol as intestinal recovery marker for measurement of drug duodenal excretion, with an iv bolus of 99mTc HIDA for measurement of drug mass within the gall bladder was used. Gall bladder volume was measured by ultrasonography. T1/2 in bile was measured by relating drug duodenal excretion to that of bile acid used as an endogenous bile marker. The use of bile acid as biliary marker was validated in two subjects receiving simultaneous iv infusion of indocyanine green. Seven healthy subjects were studied using a beta-lattam antibiotic, Cefotetan 1 g iv, as test drug. Median values during the study period (seven hours) were 51.1 mg for Cefotetan duodenal excretion, 45.2 mg for gall bladder mass and 2.8 mg/ml for concentration within the gall bladder. T1/2 of the drug in bile was 100 minutes. This technique enables measurement of mass and concentration of drugs within the gall bladder to be carried out, in addition to measurements of t1/2 of drugs in bile. These measurements may have specific application for assessment of potential efficacy of antibiotics in biliary tract infections, as well as general application for assessment of biliary excretory kinetics of drugs.\r"

Histamine concentrations in the corpus (no ulcer, median: 151 nmol/g; DU, median: 122 nmol/g) and in the antrum (no ulcer, median: 118 nmol/g; with DU, median: 113 nmol/g) of renal transplant patients, irrespective of ulcer diagnosis, and in patients with a chronic duodenal ulcer (median corpus histamine: 137 nmol/g and median antral histamine: 126 nmol/g) were not different from one another but significantly lower than the corresponding values in normal subjects (median corpus histamine: 241 nmol/g, p less than 0.01, and median antral histamine: 178 nmol/g, p less than 0.05). Histamine concentration in the corpus was significantly higher than in the antrum in all three groups of patients (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in histamine methyltransferase activity in any of the groups studied. Mucosal histamine and histamine methyltransferase activity were significantly correlated in the corpus (p less than 0.05) and antrum (p less than 0.02). Plasma concentration of histamine after transplant was higher in the patients who subsequently were discovered to have a duodenal ulcer (p less than 0.05). The occurrence of ulcer after transplantation was not related to the serum creatinine level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In nine patients with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and impaired renal function the effect of 8-ornithin vasopressin (ornipressin) on renal function and haemodynamic parameters was studied. Ornipressin was infused at a dose of 6 IU/h over a period of four hours. During ornipressin infusion an improvement of renal function was achieved as indicated by an increase of creatinine clearance (76 (15)%; p less than 0.01), urine volume (108 (29)%; p less than 0.05) and sodium excretion (168 (30)%; p less than 0.05). The hyperdynamic circulation of hepatic failure, as characterised by increased cardiac index and heart rate as well as decreased systemic vascular resistance was reversed to a nearly normal circulatory state during ornipressin infusion. The raised noradrenaline plasma concentration (1.74 (0.31) ng/ml) and plasma renin activity (13.5 (3.9) ng/ml/h) were lowered during ornipressin infusion to 0.87 (0.21) ng/ml and 5.9 (2.1) ng/ml/h, respectively (p less than 0.01). The efficacy of a vasoconstrictor agent in reverting a hyperdynamic state and improving renal function provides evidence for the substantial role of accumulation of vasodilator substances and subsequent activation of sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-axis in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction in hepatic failure. Values are expressed as mean (SE).\r"

Randomization was made at least 15 days after the bleeding episode. Propranolol was given orally at increasing doses until the resting pulse rate was reduced by approximately 25%. Atenolol was given at a fixed dose of 100 mg per day. Patients were followed up for a mean of 357 days. Rebleeding occurred in 14 patients in the placebo group, 10 in the atenolol group and eight in the propranolol group. The incidence of rebleeding was significantly lower in patients receiving propranolol than in those on placebo (propranolol vs. placebo: p = 0.01, logrank test). Atenolol was less effective than propranolol (atenolol vs. placebo: p = 0.065, logrank test). Bleeding-free survival was better for patients on active drugs than for those on placebo (propranolol vs. placebo = p = 0.01, atenolol vs. placebo: p = 0.05, logrank test). Retrospective analysis revealed that, whatever the type of treatment, abstinence from alcohol was crucial in preventing rebleeding. We conclude that beta-blocker treatment is effective in preventing rebleeding from esophageal varices in carefully selected alcoholic cirrhotic patients who survive at least 2 weeks after acute variceal hemorrhage and stop drinking.\r"

  ".W": "Liver disease in the early period following bone marrow transplantation may be due to a number of causes, including pretransplant cytoreduction with chemotherapy and irradiation. Although the relationship of venoocclusive disease to these agents has been well established, another process, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, may also occur. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence and clinical signs of these two processes as defined by histological criteria. In 103 patients studied, nine (8.8%) had venoocclusive disease and 23 (22.5%) had nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Venoocclusive disease was significantly associated with transplantation for malignancy other than acute or chronic leukemia and use of busulfan as a cytoreductive agent and occurred in younger patients. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia did not differ from the general transplant population in terms of underlying disease, cytoreductive regimen, graft vs. host disease prophylaxis or age. Both venoocclusive disease and nodular regenerative hyperplasia were associated with ascites. Venoocclusive disease had a poor prognosis, with eight of nine cases dying of or with venoocclusive disease, whereas no case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia died of liver disease and only 5 of 23 died with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Using retrospective data, five of 11 patients fulfilling clinical criteria for the diagnosis of venoocclusive disease actually had nodular regenerative hyperplasia, as did all of nine patients fulfilling the criteria for \"possible\" venoocclusive disease. These results indicate that nodular regenerative hyperplasia is a process which occurs commonly following bone marrow transplantation and which may be clinically misdiagnosed as venoocclusive disease.\r"

The focus of current research is to define the role of the numerous isozymes in cell function, to ascertain the relationship between structure and function of different isozymes and to determine how the expression of GST is regulated in different tissues. During these studies, it is expected that new roles for the GST will be proposed, and this family of multifunctional proteins will continue to hold the interest of numerous investigators for many years.\r"

Plasma renin activity (PRA) has been noted to be low, normal, and high in diabetic patients; these variable results may be explained by differences in patient selection and standardization of study conditions. We evaluated PRA and inactive renin responses in Type II normotensive (n = 7) and hypertensive (n = 12) diabetic patients specifically selected for no or minimal evidence (background retinopathy) for microvascular complications. Patients were studied in a metabolic ward after 7 days on a constant low sodium (20 meq/day) and 7 days on a high sodium (250 meq/day) diet. Nondiabetic control subjects (n = 7) were evaluated under similar conditions. On low sodium intake, mean PRA levels were significantly reduced in the hypertensive diabetic group, but were not different between the control and normotensive diabetic groups. Hypertensive diabetic patients on high sodium intake also had greater reductions in PRA responses compared with the other study groups. In general, diabetic subjects on high sodium intake excreted less sodium and had more cumulative sodium retention than control subjects. Levels of inactive renin were not significantly different between the normotensive and hypertensive diabetic patients and were comparable with the levels in control subjects. Inactive renin levels changed in a similar direction and magnitude as PRA in response to sodium intake and posture in the three study groups. Infusion of angiotensin II led to comparable reductions in PRA in both diabetic groups and in the control group, suggesting an intact short feedback loop control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potent and primate-selective renin inhibitor A-64662 (n = 8) or vehicle (n = 6) was administered intravenously for 7 days to sodium-depleted cynomolgus monkeys to investigate the chronic effects on arterial pressure, sodium excretion, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. A 0.1-mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by a continuous 0.01-mg/kg/min infusion of A-64662 lowered mean arterial pressure from 89 +/- 3 (average of 4 control days) to 75 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after 1 day of administration. This decrement was associated with marked inhibition of plasma renin activity (PRA) from 57.7 +/- 11.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.6 ng angiotensin I (Ang I)/ml/hr (p less than 0.05). Similar hypotensive levels (range 73 +/- 4 to 77 +/- 4 mm Hg) were observed on days 2-7 of A-64662 infusion and PRA remained suppressed, ranging from 0.6 +/- 0.4 to 1.9 +/- 1.0 ng Ang I/ml/hr. Plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were reduced (p less than 0.05) from the control value of 66.7 +/- 20.2 to 12.4 +/- 3.3 and 26.4 +/- 6.5 pg/ml on the second and seventh days, respectively, of A-64662 infusion. In contrast, infusion of vehicle alone had no discernible effect on mean arterial pressure, PRA, or plasma Ang II concentrations. Plasma aldosterone decreased (p less than 0.05) from control on the second and third days of A-64662 infusion, although differences between the treatment groups were not detected throughout the study. Urinary sodium excretion remained at control levels throughout the infusion of A-64662. Cessation of A-64662 administration resulted in a recovery of mean arterial pressure to preinfusion levels within 1 day. This study indicates that continuous infusion of A-64662 results in a sustained hypotension in sodium-depleted monkeys. This effect appears to be related, at least partially, to inhibition of PRA and lower plasma Ang II levels.\r"

  ".W": "Lidocaine, tetracaine, and bupivacaine are the local anesthetic agents most commonly employed for spinal anesthesia in the U.S. Lidocaine provides a short duration of anesthesia and is primarily useful for surgical and obstetrical procedures lasting less than one hour. Tetracaine and bupivacaine are used for procedures lasting 2 to 5 hours. Tetracaine appears to provide a somewhat longer duration of anesthesia and a more profound degree of motor block than does bupivacaine. On the other hand, compared with tetracaine, bupivacaine has been demonstrated to be associated with a decreased incidence of hypotension. In addition, bupivacaine may be better than tetracaine for use in orthopedic surgical procedures since it appears to be associated with a lower incidence of tourniquet pain. Vasoconstrictors can prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia of all three agents. However, the greatest duration is seen when vasoconstrictors are added to tetracaine solutions. Lidocaine and bupivacaine do not appear to benefit as much from the addition of vasoconstrictors. In general, the local anesthetic agents that are currently available for spinal anesthesia provide significant versatility. By carefully considering the planned surgical procedure, the surgeon's requirements, and the patient's characteristics (e.g., age, height, gravidity), and by understanding the factors that influence spinal anesthesia, the anesthesiologist can select a local anesthetic agent that will assure adequate and satisfying spinal anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal anesthesia is probably the most widely used form of regional anesthesia today. A number of clinical studies suggest that spinal anesthesia may be superior to general or epidural anesthesia for certain patients and for certain surgical procedures. The endocrine-metabolic response to surgery appears to be blunted when spinal anesthesia is employed compared to the response during general anesthesia. Blood loss and thromboembolic complications are also reduced when spinal anesthesia is used, particularly for major lower limb orthopedic procedures. Although long-term survival is not affected by the anesthetic technique employed, short-term mortality may be decreased in elderly patients having major orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. Compared to epidural blockade, spinal anesthesia provides a more rapid onset, a more predictable level of analgesia, and a more profound degree of surgical anesthesia. On the other hand, spinal anesthesia is associated with a greater degree of hypotension compared to epidural anesthesia. The results of these various investigations show that a scientific rationale exists for the continued use of spinal anesthesia.\r"

Two hundred and sixty-eight laser Doppler measurements were made in 59 burn wounds in 41 patients. Of the 129 burn wounds with laser Doppler readings of less than 1.4 on admission, 127 were classified ultimately through clinical observation as either deep second- or third-degree burns and required excision and closure. Therefore predictive value of a positive result (i.e., laser Doppler value less than 1.4) on admission was 98.4% using laser Doppler measurements. Clinical estimation did not correlate as well with the depth of injury.\r"

Thus infection was the cause of death in 26 (74%) of these 35 patients. The other 22 patients who survived longer than 3 days did not undergo excision and grafting before death. The primary cause of death was pneumonia. Infection was the cause of death in 12 patients of this group (55%) and thus was the major cause of death in 62% of all patients who survived more than 3 days.

We studied two patients with symptomatic fasting hypoglycemia (plasma glucose, 1.92 and 2.03 mmol/L) and a large mesenchymal neoplasm. Before therapy, the plasma insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) level measured by RIA was elevated (1879 and 1084 micrograms/L; normal range, 358-854 micrograms/L), the serum GH response to hypoglycemia was impaired, and the plasma IGF-I level was low in both patients. After treatment of the tumor, all of these abnormalities resolved in both patients. Northern blot analysis of tumor RNA revealed extremely high levels of IGF-II mRNA (greater than 100-fold higher than those in normal adult liver). Tumor fragments released IGF-II into tissue culture medium (2.1 and 7.2 micrograms IGF-II/g tissue.24 h). These findings indicate that secretion of IGF-II into the circulation by the tumor was the likely source of the elevated plasma IGF-II levels. We suggest that the primary event in tumor-induced hypoglycemia is overproduction of IGF-II by the tumor, which gives rise to hypoglycemia by a dual mechanism: increased glucose utilization mediated by the insulin-like actions of IGF-II and inhibition of GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance is associated with hyperandrogenic states. To determine the mechanisms by which androgen excess can affect insulin action, we studied insulin sensitivity in five nonobese hyperandrogenic women and six normal women. After oral glucose administration, the hyperandrogenic women had higher serum insulin concentrations than the normal women (P = 0.05). The mean cumulative peripheral serum insulin response in the hyperandrogenic women [79.6 +/- 30.8 (+/- SD) nmol/L.300 min] was significantly greater than that in the normal women (46.6 +/- 15.1 nmol/L.300 min; P less than 0.05). In the basal state and during hyperinsulinemic (20 mU/min.m2) euglycemic clamp studies serum insulin levels were similar in the two groups. Basal and insulin-mediated suppressions of hepatic glucose production determined from [3-3H]glucose specific activity were similar in the two groups. Peripheral glucose utilization was markedly diminished in the hyperandrogenic women compared to that in the normal women (27.8 +/- 6.7 vs 48.9 +/- 12.8 mumol/min.kg fat-free mass; P less than 0.01). We conclude that the insulin resistance in nonobese hyperandrogenic women is due to peripheral, but not hepatic, resistance to the action of insulin. This marked peripheral insulin resistance may result from the effects of hyperandrogenemia on skeletal muscle fiber morphology and metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "89155694\r", 
  ".W": "High endothelial venules (HEVs) derive their name from the cuboidal high walled shape of the endothelial cells and are found in T-cell areas of a wide variety of lymphoid tissues. The function of HEVs is to attract lymphocytes to lymphoid tissues, and they are thus of importance in lymphocyte recirculation. We investigated the immunohistochemical presence and localization of HEVs in thyroid tissue obtained at surgery from 13 patients with Graves' disease and 3 patients with Hashimoto's disease using the monoclonal antibody HECA 452, which reacts with an epitope on human HEVs. HEVs were found in large confined lymphocytic accumulations in 7 of the 13 Graves' disease glands and all of the Hashimoto's disease glands. These lymphocytic accumulations showed a high grade of architecture and were composed of a central B-cell follicle and a T-cell area in which the HEVs were present. The HEV-containing T-cell area formed a corona around the B-cell follicle. Plasma cells were found at the periphery of the intrathyroidally developed lymphoid tissue. In BB rats, an animal model for spontaneous autoimmune thyroid disease, the development of such HEVs containing intrathyroidal lymphoid tissue was a rather late phenomenon in the autoimmune process occurring after the appearance of anticolloid antibodies in the circulation and after initial immune activity of the thyroid draining lymph nodes. The actual development of the intrathyroidal lymphoid tissue was initiated by accumulation of lymphocytes around dendritic cells forming small cellular clusters. These small clusters later developed into larger formation in which HEVs were detectable. The adherence of B- and T-lymphocytes to human intrathyroidal HEVs was additionally studied using an in vitro adherence assay. B-Lymphocytes preferentially adhered to thyroidal HEVs. This adherence pattern is similar to that of HEVs in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (tonsils and Peyer's patches). We conclude that lymphoid tissue with a lymphocyte recirculation pattern similar to that of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue can be found in thyroid glands involved in a process of autoimmune reactivity; the BB rat study suggests that the development of such tissue occurs during the chronic phases of the process.\r"

The mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be mediated by insulin and/or vasoactive gut hormones. We studied in normo- and hypertensive elderly subjects the effects of the synthetic long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (SMS 201-995) on the BP reduction that follows oral glucose administration in subjects who are recumbent and on their postglucose plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and insulin concentrations. After placebo treatment, mean arterial pressure fell by 15 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) in the 10 hypertensive subjects and by 7 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) in the 10 normotensive subjects. In contrast, when 50 micrograms octreotide were given sc, BP did not change significantly in either group. Oral glucose did not induce a rise in plasma VIP after either octreotide or placebo administration. The postglucose rises in plasma glucose concentrations were similar after octreotide and placebo treatments in both groups. After placebo administration the postglucose plasma insulin levels increased from 79 to 519 pmol/L in the hypertensive subjects and from 63 to 464 pmol/L in the normotensive subjects, whereas after octreotide treatment plasma insulin increased little in either group. These data indicate that treatment with octreotide holds promise for patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension, and that VIP does not seem to play a role in this phenomenon.\r"

Partially purified insulin receptor from H-35 cells, when incubated with B-10 IgG, had increased tyrosine kinase activity for a synthetic peptide sequentially similar to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60v-arc (the gene product responsible for cellular transformation by the Rous sarcoma virus). In H-35 cells, both B-10 IgG and insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in an endogenous 185,000 mol wt protein. This phosphoprotein may be similar to the cellular substrate for insulin in hepatoma and other cultured cell lines demonstrated by others. These results suggest that antiinsulin receptor antibodies (B-10) may initiate their insulin-like effects via tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, activation of its tyrosine kinase activity, and phosphorylation of a cellular protein substrate of 185,000 mol wt.\r"

The etiology of the carcinoid syndrome is not well understood, but serotonin seems to be involved in the diarrhea, whereas tachykinins may play a role in the flush reaction. In a double blind placebo-controlled study, we studied the effect of octreotide in 20 patients with midgut carcinoid tumors and liver metastases. A sc injection of 50 micrograms octreotide caused a significant (P less than 0.001) decrease in median plasma tachykinins and serum pancreatic polypeptide, GH, and insulin for up to 4 h. Administration of octreotide (50 micrograms, twice daily, sc) caused a 26% decrease in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetia acid excretion, but the number of flushing attacks or bowel movements did not change significantly. A typical flush was provoked by pentagastrin, and plasma tachykinin and serotonin levels were measured. The flush reaction was graded on a 10-point visual analog scale. Octreotide (50 micrograms, sc) given 45 min before flush stimulation prevented tachykinin release completely and significantly reduced the median flushing score from 8.5 to 2. Placebo administered in the same way did not prevent tachykinin release after pentagastrin administration. Thus, octreotide prevents pentagastrin-induced flushing and the related hormonal changes in patients with the carcinoid syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of trophoblast secretion of the placental proteins CG (hCG), placental lactogen (hPL), and pregnancy specific-beta-1-glycoprotein (SP-1) has not been fully elucidated. We therefore studied the secretion of hCG, hCG-beta subunit, hCG-alpha subunit, hPL, and SP-1, both in the basal state and after exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP, during the in vitro differentiation of cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblasts. Term placental tissue was enzymatically digested and cytotrophoblasts purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. At the time of seeding of 4-6 X 10(5) cells/ml in 35-mm flasks all of the cells were mononuclear and 48% contained hCG-alpha, but none contained hCG or hCG-beta by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase immuno-histochemical method. After 3 days in culture, hCG-alpha and hCG or hCG-beta were present in multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts and in the mononuclear cytotrophoblasts. During the 5 days in culture, the secretion of hCG, hCG-alpha, hPL and SP-1 into the media increased and reached a maximum on day 4 followed by a decrease on day 5. Basal hCG-beta secretion was very low and did not change during culture. The ratio of hCG-alpha/hCG decreased from days 1-4 of culture. Incubation with 8-bromo-cAMP for 24 h stimulated the secretion of hCG and hCG-alpha, whereas hCG-beta and hPL levels did not change. The secretion of SP-1, however, was inhibited by 8-bromo-cAMP. These results indicate that the cytotrophoblasts secrete hCG, hCG-beta and hCG-alpha during in vitro differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts. Since the basal ratio of hCG to hCG-alpha secretion changed during 5 days in culture and a cAMP analogue differentially modulated the secretion of the different placental protein hormones, the physiological regulation of secretion of each of the proteins also may differ.\r"

The antigenic specificity of LKM-1 autoantibodies from 13 patients was investigated by immunoblot analysis of human liver microsomal proteins. Polypeptides of 50, 55, and 64 kD were detected with these antisera. A high titer LKM-1 serum was selected to screen a human liver lambda gt11 cDNA expression library, resulting in the isolation of several complementary (c)DNA clones. Autoantibodies affinity purified from proteins expressed by two of the immunopositive cDNA clones, HLD8.2 and HLD13.2, specifically react with a 50-kD protein of human liver microsomes and display immunofluorescence staining of the proximal renal tubular epithelia characteristic of LKM-1 sera. Determination of the sequence of HLD8.2 revealed that it encodes a recently described cytochrome P450db1. A bacterial fusion protein constructed from HLD8.2 proved to be a specific and sensitive diagnostic reagent. All sera from patients with LKM-1 positive liver disease react with this fusion protein. No reaction was seen, however, for sera from patients with other types of autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, systemic immunological disorders, or healthy controls.\r"

  ".W": "Based largely on evidence of increased target tissue beta-adrenergic receptor densities and responsiveness in animal and, to a lesser extent, human tissues, it is often assumed that thyroid hormone excess results in increased sensitivity to catecholamines in vivo, thus explaining several clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis. To test the hypothesis that thyrotoxicosis results in increased target tissue beta-adrenergic receptor densities and correspondingly increased metabolic and hemodynamic sensitivity to epinephrine in vivo, we measured these in 10 normal humans before and after administration of triiodothyronine (100 micrograms daily) for 10 d. Thyrotoxicosis increased beta-adrenergic receptor densities in fat (approximately 60%) and skeletal muscle (approximately 30%). Despite increments in beta-adrenergic receptor densities in these and probably other target tissues, metabolic and hemodynamic sensitivity to epinephrine in vivo was unaltered. An apparently adaptive increase in insulin secretion plausibly explains normal glycemic, glycogenolytic/glycolytic, lipolytic, and ketogenic sensitivity to epinephrine in the thyrotoxic state. In view of this striking homeostatic efficiency of the intact individual, the finding of altered adrenergic receptors, even in relevant target tissues, should not be extrapolated to altered sensitivity to catecholamines in vivo in the absence of direct testing of that hypothesis. With respect to the clinical issue, these data suggest that increased sensitivity to catecholamines does not explain clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis in humans.\r"

The mutant L. pneumophila is nonlethal to guinea pigs and does not revert to virulence with passage through guinea pigs. In contrast, exposure of guinea pigs to aerosols containing wild-type L. pneumophila induces a pneumonic illness that clinically and pathologically resembles Legionnaires' disease in humans. Guinea pigs immunized by aerosol exposure to mutant L. pneumophila developed a strong humoral immune response to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens with reciprocal antibody titers of 32-512 (median 256) by the indirect fluorescent antibody assay, compared with titers of less than 2 for control (sham immunized) guinea pigs. Mutant immunized but not control guinea pigs also developed strong cell-mediated immune responses to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens, as demonstrated in assays of cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity and in vitro splenic lymphocyte proliferation. Mutant immunized guinea pigs developed strong protective immunity to lethal aerosol challenge with wild-type L. pneumophila. In four independent experiments 40-83% of mutant immunized guinea pigs survived compared with 0% of control guinea pigs. Overall, 13 of 21 (62%) mutant immunized guinea pigs survived compared with 0 of 21 (0%) control guinea pigs (P = 0.00002, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). Mutant immunization induced protection comparable to wild-type immunization in these studies; 8 of 14 (57%) guinea pigs immunized by wild-type L. pneumophila survived. This study demonstrates that guinea pigs immunized with a live avirulent mutant L. pneumophila vaccine (a) develop a strong humoral immune response to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens; (b) develop a strong cell-mediated immune response to wild-type L. pneumophila antigens; and (c) develop protective immunity to lethal aerosol challenge with wild-type L. pneumophila. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a vaccine against Legionnaires' disease.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated amyloid fibrils from three cases of systemic senile amyloidosis (SSA) contained subunit proteins with molecular masses of 14 (10-20%), 10-12 (60-80%), and 5-6 kD (5-10%) when fractionated under reducing and dissociating conditions. This grouping was identical to that seen in SKO, a case of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) studied earlier. Amino acid sequencing confirmed that SSA subunit proteins were in fact prealbumin (transthyretin). Complete sequence analysis of one SSA preparation revealed the presence of a new variant Pa (TTr) molecule with a single amino acid substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 122. Further studies used an antiserum specific for SKO IV, a subunit protein of SKO previously shown to correspond to carboxy-terminal 78 residues (positions 49-127) of (TTr). Anti-SKO IV reacted with SSA in tissue at equivalent dilutions to anti-Pa (TTr) and with the 10-12-kD fraction of SSA on Western blots; reactivity was blocked by SKO IV, but not by Pa (TTr). SSA is a form of systemic amyloidosis caused by tissue deposition of Pa (TTr) and its fragments, with shared conformational or subunit antigenicity to at least one form of FAP. Identification of a new variant Pa (TTr) molecule in one case suggests further that SSA may be a genetically determined disease expressed late in life.\r"

By multiple criteria, the species of IGF binding proteins produced by human fibroblasts are distinct from the HepG2/amniotic fluid IGF binding protein, but share many characteristics with the growth hormone-dependent IGF binding protein forms predominant in normal adult human plasma. Treatment of cultured human fibroblasts with growth hormone produced an increase in IGF binding protein activity in the medium, while addition of glucocorticoids markedly diminished IGF binding activity. Insulin, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and progesterone had no effect on IGF binding activity in fibroblast media. In comparison, HepG2 IGF binding activity was enhanced by progesterone, decreased by insulin, and unaffected by growth hormone or glucocorticoid treatment. Five molecular forms of IGF binding proteins were identified by Western ligand blots in human fibroblast conditioned medium, with Mr = 41,500, 37,000, 32,000, 28,000, and 23,000.

  ".W": "A liquid culture technique was used to study 23 synovial fluids (SF) (21 from inflammatory joint diseases and 2 noninflammatory SF) and supernatants of two cultured rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissues for colony-stimulating factor (CSF). The proliferative responses of human peripheral blood macrophage-depleted non-T cells treated with synovial fluids, supernatants of synovial tissue explants, and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage (rGM)-CSF were compared. Aggregates of cells that formed in long-term cultures (15 d) were similar for each applied agent and consisted of macrophages, eosinophils, and large blasts. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was proportional to the concentration of rGM-CSF and was accompanied by an increase in number and size of cellular aggregates formed in the cultures. CSF activity was observed in inflammatory SF, with tritiated thymidine uptake of 3,501 +/- 1,140 cpm in the presence of RA samples (n = 15) compared to 1,985 +/- 628 for non-RA inflammatory SF (n = 7) (P less than 0.05) and 583 +/- 525 for medium (n = 6) (P less than 0.01). The proliferative response to RA SF was often more apparent when the samples were diluted, because at higher concentrations the RA SF was inhibitory. Two RA SF were fractionated by Sephadex G100 column chromatography; low levels of CSF activity were detected in fractions corresponding to Mr of 70-100 kD, but the major CSF activity was found in the 20-24-kD fractions. A polyclonal rabbit anti-GM-CSF antibody eliminated the stimulating activity from both rGM-CSF and RA SF. Finally, a specific RIA identified significant levels of GM-CSF (40-140 U/ml) in the culture supernatants of 3 additional RA synovial tissues. These data document the local production of GM-CSF in rheumatoid synovitis and are the first description of this cytokine at a site of disease activity.\r"

Because of the extreme lability of the isolated, functional molybdenum cofactor, direct cofactor replacement therapy is not feasible, and a search for stable biosynthetic intermediates was undertaken. From studies of cocultured fibroblasts from affected individuals, two complementation groups were identified. Coculture of group A and group B cells, without heterokaryon formation, led to the appearance of active sulfite oxidase. Use of conditioned media indicated that a relatively stable, diffusible precursor produced by group B cells could be used to repair sulfite oxidase in group A recipient cells. Although the extremely low levels of precursor produced by group B cells preclude its direct characterization, studies with a heterologous, in vitro reconstitution system suggest that the precursor that accumulates in group B cells is the same as a molybdopterin precursor identified in the Neurospora crassa molybdopterin mutant nit-1, and that a converting enzyme is present in group A cells which catalyzes an activation reaction analogous to that of a converting enzyme identified in the Escherichia coli molybdopterin mutant ChlA1.\r"

Nonetheless, the basis for the B cell hyperactivity is difficult to study in vitro. In this study, we have obtained the resting B cells from patients with entirely inactive SLE by collecting them sedimenting in a high density fraction on a Percoll density gradient. These resting SLE B cells proliferated in vitro at a higher rate than normal B cells when exposed to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). In addition, significant proliferation was observed earlier in the course of culture in SLE patients than in normal controls. Moreover, the SLE resting B cells, once triggered by SAC produced abnormally high numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in response to T cell-derived soluble factors. There was less frequency of circulating Leu 1+ B cells in the SLE patients than in normal controls. Moreover, not only Leu 1+ B cells but also Leu 1- B cells of SLE patients were more responsive to SAC than those of normal controls. The results indicate that the B cell hyperactivity in human SLE can be induced by in vitro stimuli, and may not be limited to the Leu 1+ B cell subset.\r"

These SLE antibodies were alloreactive as they precipitated VLA molecules from only 5 of 22 normal donors' platelets and did not react with the lupus patients' own platelets, despite the expression of apparently normal amounts of VLA on the donors' cells. Two-dimensional O'Farrell analysis demonstrated no differences in the molecular weight or isoelectric point of GPIa and GPIIa obtained from platelets of alloantibody reactive or unreactive donors. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments with VLA chain-specific monoclonal antibodies, and the pattern of immunoprecipitation of several different VLA heterodimers demonstrated that the alloantibody-reactive determinant was present on the VLA-2 heterodimer, and not other VLA molecules. Thus, these SLE sera demonstrate a previously unrecognized antigenic polymorphism of the VLA-2 (platelet GPIa/IIa) heterodimer, platelet alloantigen Hca.\r"

The role of microwaves in producing rapid special stains on cryostat sections was also assessed. Methods used permitted stains such as periodic acid Schiff, alcian blue, Gordon and Sweets's reticulin, Masson Fontana, Elastica, Prussian blue and Van Gieson to be performed within three minutes of cutting a cryostat section. The cytological detail of nuclei was much clearer using the microwave technique, allowing more accurate determination of cell type. The microwave oven seems to have major potential in improving the diagnostic accuracy of surgical frozen sections.\r"

  ".W": "A tissue processing instrument (the Histokinette) was modified by the addition of an electronic timing device which allows an immunocytochemical staining technique (the APAAP method) to be performed as a semiautomated procedure. After incubation with primary monoclonal antibodies (applied by hand) slides (up to 72 in a batch) are placed in racks and cycled through tanks of reagents, comprising anti-mouse Ig followed by APAAP complexes with intervening timed draining and washing stages. This semiautomated process gave consistent staining results and offered considerable savings in time compared with conventional methods. The same reagent baths were used over four months on an almost daily basis without deterioration in staining intensity, and consequently the calculated overall cost of the staining procedure was less than if the reagents had been applied by hand and then discarded. The machine is now into its eleventh month of operation; the reagents have been changed twice. It is suggested that this approach, because of savings in time and increased consistency, may be an attractive technique for the routine immunocytochemical staining of slides, and that the nature of the APAAP method is particularly suitable for automation as the necessary reagents can be produced at low cost.\r"

  ".U": "89156005\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed all studies (since 1947) reporting recurrence rates for treatment of primary (previously untreated) basal cell carcinomas using surgical excision, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, and Mohs micrographic surgery. Our findings indicate that recurrences following treatment of primary basal cell carcinoma appear later than is generally acknowledged in the literature. We found that less than one-third of all recurrences appear in the first year following treatment; only 50% appear within the first 2 years following treatment; and only 66%, or nearly two-thirds, appear within the first 3 years following treatment. A good rule of thumb is that the 10-year recurrence rate is double, or 2 times, that of the 2-year recurrence rate. Furthermore, 18% of recurrences appear between the fifth and tenth year following treatment. These results held true, irrespective of treatment modality examined. Seventy-two studies reporting short-term recurrence rates (follow-up less than 5 years) had a weighted average recurrence rate of 4.2%, whereas 34 long-term studies (follow-up of 5 years) had a weighted average recurrence rate of 8.7%, or more than 2 times the short-term rate. Five-year recurrence rates by treatment modality are as follows: Mohs micrographic surgery 1.0%, surgical excision 10.1%, curettage and electrodesiccation 7.7%, radiation therapy 8.7%, and cryosurgery 7.5%. We conclude that the reporting of recurrence rate data for basal cell carcinoma should be standardized using 5-year life table analysis, and even more important is our conclusion that lifetime follow-up is necessary after treatment of primary basal cell carcinoma in order both recurrences and new primaries.\r"

All the available evidence indicates that HIV infection in health care workers in the United States results primarily from exposure outside the health care setting, and is acquired by one of the conventional routes of transmission. A small number of health care workers have been infected with HIV through occupational exposure. Prospective surveillance studies indicate that the risk of seroconversion after needlestick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.5%. The level of risk associated with exposure of mucous membranes or nonintact skin is far less.\r"

Although as yet limited in number, studies have shown monounsaturated fatty acids to be the equivalent of polyunsaturated fatty acids or low-fat diets in lowering blood low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. The monounsaturated acids apparently have the added advantage of not causing a decrease in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol or an increase in blood triglycerides, which can be a consequence of other dietary modifications. In the past, olive oil was the only fat rich in monounsaturated acids that was generally available in the United States. Recently, canola oil, a fat also rich in monounsaturates, has appeared in retail food outlets. Other potential sources are high oleic sunflower and safflower oils. Because the culinary and organoleptic properties of the monounsaturated-rich oils can be identical to those of currently used oils, they should be readily accepted by the consumer. Whether the preferred healthful diet is one low in fat or one high in monoenes or polyenes, the primary dietary recommendation remains--decrease the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.\r"

Feeding and alimentation skills regress gradually because of cognitive and physical deterioration; uncontrolled weight loss is almost inevitable in latter stages, despite quality of care. A number of etiological models exist, including some related to vitamin and mineral metabolism, although research has not yet yielded a certain cause or cure. Treatment is symptomatic relief through interdisciplinary health care intervention. Psychological, medical, nutritional, and nursing support are needed by the caregivers as well as by the patients themselves.\r"

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 800 mg calcium may be insufficient to meet the needs of women who are \"poor absorbers\" of calcium. Research linking calcium intake with bone density is confounded by the type of bone measured, the variation in efficiency of calcium absorption among individuals, and the methodology for measuring calcium intake. Although calcium supplements will retard cortical bone loss in some postmenopausal women and are generally safe, they are not so effective as estrogen.\r"

Clinical evaluation was performed by the SCAG scale. The trial, which included a 1-month placebo run-in period, showed that both placebo and nicergoline were associated with some degree of improvement. The effect of nicergoline, however, was significantly greater and more sustained, steadily increasing with time. In particular, the difference between nicergoline and placebo in mean total SCAG score was 5.5 at 3 months (95% confidence interval: 3.6-7.4) and increased to 9.8 at 6 months (95% confidence interval: 7.8-11.8). A comparison of nicergoline versus placebo in the frequencies of changes in each item of the SCAG showed also a significant difference at 6 months, the percent of patients displaying an improvement by at least 2 points ranging from 13.5 (bothersome) to 30.2 (disorientation) in nicergoline group, against 4.1 (self-care) to 14.3 (fatigue) in placebo group. The safety of nicergoline, as judged by hemodynamic changes and drug-related adverse reactions, was quite satisfactory.\r"

Two specific genetic mechanisms are known which could underlie the evolution of aging under these conditions: age-specificity of gene effects and antagonistic pleiotropy between early and late ages. Comparative evidence indicates that senescence occurs only when the stipulations of the evolutionary theory are met. Laboratory experiments with Drosophila indicate that prolonging the action of natural selection leads to the evolution of postponed senescence. The genetic variation involved in such postponed senescence exhibits both age-specificity and antagonistic pleiotropy. These theories and empirical findings together suggest that the best general theory of aging now available is the evolutionary theory. In addition, this work has yielded Drosophila stocks with postponed senescence that are being used to unravel physiological mechanisms of senescence.\r"

In response to maximal bicycle ergometry exercise, there was a marked rise in NK activity in the old (7.52 +/- 1.71 LU/10(6) pre-exercise vs 15.20 +/- 3.27 LU/10(6) post-exercise, p less than .03) and the young (6.29 +/- .48 LU 10(6) vs 14.56 +/- 1.86 LU 10(6), p less than .005) subjects. Lymphocytes bearing the NK marker Leu 11a also rose significantly post-exercise in both old and young subjects. We conclude that healthy elderly subjects increase their NK activity in response to the acute stressor, exercise, at least as effectively as do young subjects.\r"

The percentage of pan-T MoAb-positive cells decreased with age, which was attributable to a relative decline in the CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, more precisely in the CD8+ CD11- cytotoxic T cells. Those of CD4+ Leu-8- helper T cells, CD3+ HLA-DR+-activated T cells, and natural killer subsets (Leu-7+, CD16+, Leu-7+ CD16+ or Leu-7+ CD16-) increased with age. The absolute numbers of most of the lymphocyte subsets examined declined with age except that those of natural killer cell subsets and helper T cells remained unchanged. It should be noted that the PBL subsets differed markedly according to age and sex, the changes being more evident among women.\r"

Young subjects demonstrated a modest but significant rise in plasma glucose level (89 +/- 1 mg/dl to 92 +/- 1 mg/dl, p less than .05) and glucose production rate (1.7 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/min to 1.9 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/min, p less than .05) between 0540 and 0800. No rise was detected in the plasma glucose or glucose production rate in older subjects as a group, between these times. However, a few elderly subjects did display a dawn glucose rise. Changes in plasma insulin levels were not significant for either young or old subjects. Older subjects had significantly lower mean peak growth hormone levels during the night than young subjects (6.7 +/- 1.3 vs 10.1 +/- 1.6 ng/ml, p less than .05). These results demonstrate a modest rise in plasma glucose levels and glucose production rate in healthy young subjects consistent with previous reports of the dawn phenomenon.

Clinical evaluation was performed at monthly intervals; repeat endoscopy was performed at the time of symptom recurrence or at 6 to 9 months after ulcer healing. Gastric ulcer recurred in 20 of 58 patients (35%). While 15 (75%) with ulcer recurrence had symptoms, 5 (25%) had asymptomatic recurrences. There were no differences in the incidence of ulcer relapse or symptom recurrences between groups. We conclude that gastric ulcers recur in approximately one-third of patients within 9 months of ulcer healing.\r"

Up to 52% improved clinically and 59% sigmoidoscopically. Relapses commonly occurred within 2 months of these \"spontaneous\" improvements. In another six trials of 174 patients in remission receiving only placebo therapy (134 followed for 6 months and 40 for 12 months), up to 51% remained in remission. Favorable predictive factors for continued remission included a normal rectal mucosa on sigmoidoscopy, limited extent of colitis, and remission recently achieved by active therapy or maintained by therapy for at least 1 year before study entry. Thus, patients can get and stay better with no \"specific\" therapy. We have clarified advantageous predictive factors.\r"

  ".W": "RIIIS/J mice produce low antibody responses to several polysaccharide Ag of bacterial origin. They have low levels of serum IgM and IgG3 and high levels of serum IgG2a and IgG2b. Low serum IgM and IgG3 have been attributed to a low frequency of CD5 (Ly-1) B cells, which play an important role in the production of natural antibodies. Indeed, RIIIS/J mice have a low frequency of CD5 (Ly-1)+, IgM bright+, Ly-5 (B220)dull+ (i.e., CD5 (Ly-1) B) cells in their peritoneum. RIIIS/J mice treated with LPS produce a low anti-bromelain-treated mouse RBC splenic plaque-forming cell response and a normal anti-mouse transferrin splenic PFC response. Those data are compatible with the fact that CD5 (Ly-1) B cells contain the precursors of B lymphocytes secreting anti-bromelain-treated mouse RBC antibody. However, they have a higher frequency of IgM bright+, Mac-1+ cells in their peritoneum. These cells represent the CD5 (Ly-1) \"sister population\" of CD5 (Ly-1) B cells described by others. This suggests that characteristics usually associated with the CD5 (Ly-1) lineage are applicable only to the CD5 (Ly-1)+ Mac-1+ IgM+ population, but not the related CD5 (Ly-1)- Mac-1+ IgM+ population. RIIIS/J mice should thus prove a valuable model to study the CD5 (Ly-1) B cell lineage.\r"

It had a Mr approximately 25 kDa, and is reproduced by rGM-CSF. Moreover, the MLR-enhancing activity of both the 25-kDa molecule and rGM-CSF have been neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antiserum. Both IL-1 and GM-CSF have autonomous enhancing activity, but they collaborate with each other in enhancing the MLR.

We tested the role of the NK-specific gene, NK1.1, in regulating the rejection of allogeneic bone marrow cell grafts. NK1.1+ mice, that are known to display strong resistance against Hh-1 incompatible grafts, were crossed to H-2/Hh-1 identical NK1.1-, poor responder mice, and the progeny were backcrossed to the poor responder parent. The segregating mice were individually typed for their expression of NK1.1 and the ability to resist Hh-1 incompatible bone marrow cells (BMC). A strong correlation was noted between expression of NK1.1 and rejection of H-2d/Hh-1d BMC. Our results support the idea that NK1.1 is one of the genes responsible for strong resistance to Hh-1d (determinant 2) but not for Hh-1j (determinant 3) BMC grafts. We suggest that the NK1.1 molecule functions as an accessory molecule in the cellular interactions involving the recognition of Hh-1 determinants.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the proliferative response of PBL to the mitogens PHA and PWM and Candida albicans Ag in 301 HIV seropositive homosexual men, of whom 55 had AIDS. The responses to PHA were reduced only in the clinically ill HIV seropositive subjects. In contrast, the responses to PWM were profoundly reduced in most HIV seropositive subjects including the asymptomatic group. Further analysis of 16 HIV seropositive subjects showed that the proliferative responses were reduced in both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. A total of 15 HIV seropositive individuals with low responses to PWM, of whom seven had AIDS and eight controls were chosen for the following studies. Expression of T3, Ti, delta receptors, and CD2 was investigated and showed an increased percentage of CD2 receptors positive cells in HIV seropositive subjects without AIDS. The proliferative responses of PBL to stimulation with PHA, PWM, antibodies to CD3, or antibodies to CD2 were investigated and showed significant correlation in controls, whereas in contrast, only the responses to PHA and CD2ab correlated in patients with AIDS. The proliferative responses to CD2ab and CD3ab in controls were larger than the responses to both PHA and PWM. In patients, these responses were less suppressed than the responses to PWM indicating that stimulation with mitogens is more complex than a simple stimulation of Ti/T3 and CD2 receptors. Further investigations were done on resting T cells, i.e., lymphocytes depleted of macrophages and pre-activated cells. Addition of PHA to these cells resulted in preactivation with expression of IL-2R (CD25) but not in proliferation. In contrast, addition of PHA plus SRBC, which bind to the CD2 receptors caused IL-2R expression, IL-2 production, and proliferation. Addition of PWM + SRBC did not result in proliferation. A comparison of the responses to PHA + SRBC of resting T cells from 26 HIV seropositive individuals, of whom seven had AIDS and 12 seronegative controls, showed that these responses were normal or only slightly decreased in the 19 seropositive men without AIDS whereas it was decreased in AIDS patients. Nevertheless, all AIDS patients showed clear-cut responses in this assay. Thus, the discrepancy between responses to PHA and PWM may be explained by an at least partially preserved function of the PHA/CD2-dependent pathway. We suggest that the defect induced by the HIV infection primarily concerns T3/Ti-induced responses.\r"

Using metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE, we demonstrate that human skin fibroblasts synthesize and secrete C1 inhibitor with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa in the cell lysate and 102 kDa in the extracellular medium. This C1 inhibitor had the capacity to bind activated C1s. Fibroblasts synthesized 30- to 50-fold more C1 inhibitor than was synthesized in monocytes. As previously reported, fibroblasts also synthesized C1r and C1s. IFN-gamma, IFN-beta 1, and TNF had significant, but distinct, effects on synthesis of C1 inhibitor, C1r, and C1s. Incubation of the cells with IFN-gamma, 1000 U/ml, for 24 h induced increases in the synthesis of C1 inhibitor, C1r, and C1s by 4.2-, 1.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. IFN-beta 1 had effects similar to IFN-gamma, although smaller in magnitude. TNF, 12.5 ng/ml, induced increases in the synthesis of C1 inhibitor, C1r, and C1s by 1.5-, 1.4- and 2.6-fold. IL-1, IFN-beta 2 (IL-6), and LPS did not affect synthesis of C1 inhibitor, C1r, or C1s. Fibroblasts are present in large amounts in most tissues. Synthesis of C1 inhibitor, C1r, and C1s by these cells could provide a source of these important proteins in body tissues. In addition, fibroblasts should be a good model for the in vitro study of genetic diseases involving the synthesis of these proteins.\r"

Our findings indicate that, in man, similar or identical glycoprotein(s) are recognized by these independently and diversely obtained antibodies. All antibodies showed identical immunohistologic patterns of reactivity on a variety of lymphoid and nonlymphoid human tissues, and demonstrated similar bands on Western blots of both crude tonsil lymphocyte lysates and highly purified Hermes-1 Ag preparations. Similarly, purified CD44/p80 Ag from RBC and human serum bound Hermes-1. Preclearing of tonsil lysates with the Hermes-1 antibody removed antigenic activity for all antibodies. Cross-blocking experiments demonstrated that A3D8, IM7 (anti-Pgp-1), and Hermes-2 antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes. Finally, expression of the epitopes defined by the Hermes-1, Hermes-3, H2-7, and H3-61 antibodies on RBC was shown to be regulated by the In(Lu) gene. These findings unify several different lines of investigation, and suggest the possibility that the CD44/Pgp-1/Hermes class of molecules may serve as cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion/recognition elements for both hematolymphoid and non-hematolymphoid cell types.\r"

However, an addition of PMA to the culture resulted in a striking inhibition of the generation of LAK cells. In contrast, IL-2-induced cell proliferation, IL-2R expression, and LFA-1 expression were enhanced by the addition of PMA. Kinetic studies revealed that the addition of PMA during the final 24 h, but not 4 h, of the culture was sufficient to inhibit the generation of LAK cells. The same inhibition of LAK activity was observed when 4-day cultured LAK cells were pretreated with PMA for over 12 h before cytotoxicity assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed that PMA pretreatment had no effect on the binding of LAK cells to target cells. PMA pretreatment of LAK cells caused total disappearance of protein kinase C (PKC) activity from LAK cells concomitant with the loss of LAK activity. However, PMA-pretreated LAK cells cultured for another 24 h in the absence of PMA revealed levels of PKC activity and cytotoxicity identical with untreated LAK cells. These results strongly suggest that PMA-induced down-regulation of LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is due to the inactivation of PKC-dependent transduction systems that are essential post LAK cell-target cell binding.\r"

In spite of this there are no objective guidelines to enable the clinician to select those cases in whom a definite benefit is likely, or in whom such procedures might best be avoided. A total of 147 children with established bilateral glue ear randomized to adenoidectomy (A) or no pharyngeal surgery (NS) treatment groups were examined for clearance of effusion in an unoperated ear after one year. Outcome was analysed with respect to the pre-operative Radiographic Palatal Airway size in three groups in relation to mean measurements obtained from matched populations of normal children and those with established disease. Those with small airways had significantly increased clearance following A when compared with NS between the ages of 3-7 years. Adenoidectomy should probably not be performed in those children with large airway measurements, although the outcome may ultimately be related to the age at which surgery is performed.\r"

Free-field voice testing was carried out in 101 patients and the Rinne tuning-fork test in a different group of 127 patients prior to clinical or audiometric evaluation. The results were subsequently compared to air and bone conduction pure-tone thresholds assessed using rigorous standards. Depending on the audiometric definition as to what constitutes a hearing impairment, the sensitivity of free-field voice testing to identify such an impairment because of an inability to hear a whispered voice at two feet (60 cm.) was 86 per cent or better with the specificity being in the region of 90 per cent. In the Rinne test the 256 Hz fork was superior to the 512 Hz fork (p less than 0.05) and the loudness comparison method superior to the threshold decay method (p less than 0.01) in detecting an air-bone gap. Combining the responses to the two forks did not improve the results. The Rinne test with the 256 Hz fork will identify correctly 48 per cent of individuals with a 15 dB, 69 per cent with a 20 dB, 87 per cent with a 25 dB, and 95 per cent with a 30 dB conductive impairment. In all instances the specificity is greater than 90 per cent.\r"

At the boundary between necrotic segments and nondemarcated stumps there was a cap of densely aggregated or hypercontracted myofilaments which stained strongly for precipitated calcium. The membrane which demarcated the stumps was found partially formed in the necrotic pulp close to this cap, attached to the plasma membrane. While forming it had a free edge and probably resulted from spontaneous aggregation of phospholipids in the pulp. Other portions of newly formed membrane were found encircling organelles inside necrotic segments. Prompt formation of a demarcating membrane probably limits the extent of necrosis in injured fibers.\r"

We have used the clonally related +GC and -GC strains of HSV-1 to define the pathophysiological basis of neurovirulence in a rabbit model. Following intranasal inoculation, +GC infection was nearly uniformly fatal while -GC infection was asymptomatic. The +GC infected animals developed electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities which preceded severe motor seizures. Tropism of the +GC strain for specific CNS nerve centers and the expression of viral antigens within them correlated with its virulence. Although both viruses invaded and replicated within the brain, +GC replicated to slightly higher titers and expressed more abundant viral antigen than -GC. The relatively less efficient replication of -GC appeared to correlate with its temperature-sensitive phenotype in vitro. Both +GC and -GC antigens were found in cerebral cortical layers IV-VI, and in several central nervous system trigeminal and olfactory system structures. However, +GC spread more completely throughout the brain to involve the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, several brainstem nuclei and the locus ceruleus. The +GC antigens were also found in cerebral cortical layer I of animals that developed seizures. These results indicate that the ability of HSV-1 to induce electrophysiologic brain abnormalities is associated with its ability to replicate within specific brain nerve centers.\r"

At all ages, yet the sooner the better, starting preferably in the womb but at least immediately after birth, the application of the principles of chronobiology requires the study of nutrition. In many cases, e.g., in the case of an increased risk of developing high blood pressure later in life, dietary preventive interventions should eventually precede drug treatment. That such intervention should take place at the earliest individualized recognition of risk seems reasonable and is an aim of chronobiologic research. In any event, a mathematical rhythm spectrum becomes evident in any variable measured with sufficient density over an appropriately long span; it constitutes the fabric of all life. In the science and practice of nutrition today, \"cherchez le controle\" (i.e., the provision of a control) requires the assessment of a multifrequency rhythmic structure.\r"

To determine the effect of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose (BAY-g-5421), on expression of NIDDM in this model, young male obese and lean littermates were fed for 12 wk diets containing either 54% starch, sucrose, or sucrose plus acarbose (150 mg acarbose/kg diet). Body weight; fasting levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, insulin and glucose; response levels of insulin and glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); and total urinary glucose were determined. Supplementation of the sucrose diet with acarbose reduced final body weight in obese rats, as well as serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, response insulin, and urinary glucose in both phenotypes. Glucosuria was normalized in acarbose-treated obese rats. In addition, acarbose improved the glycemic response following OGTT in both phenotypes. These findings demonstrate that acarbose is effective in moderating the metabolic effects of NIDDM in this diabetic rodent model, and suggest that acarbose may have potential in the management of NIDDM in humans.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, dietary protein, and starvation on protein degradation in skeletal muscle of perfused rat hindquarters, rates of myofibrillar and total protein degradation were estimated from the release of 3-methylhistidine (N tau-methylhistidine, 3-MH) and tyrosine, respectively. In rats fed a 20% protein diet (controls), the fractional degradation rate of myofibrillar protein was approximately 56% of the total muscle protein. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, 3-MH release by perfused muscle increased significantly on d 1 of treatment and sustained a high level thereafter. By contrast, tyrosine release did not change. Feeding a 50% protein diet for 1 wk altered neither 3-MH nor tyrosine release. Protein-free feeding, though, suppressed tyrosine release to 49% of controls, but did not affect 3-MH release. Starvation for 3 d did not affect tyrosine release, but did increase 3-MH release to 203% of controls. These results indicate that in diabetic and starved rats myofibrillar protein is preferentially degraded, while in protein-deficient rats, non-myofibrillar protein degradation is selectively suppressed. From these observations, we conclude that the degradation of myofibrillar and non-myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscle can be differentially regulated.\r"

Specific 125I-insulin binding to crude liver membranes from female corpulent rats fed either starch or sucrose was reduced to approximately 50% of that seen in lean rats (14 vs. 7%). Affinity of insulin receptors was similar in all groups, suggesting that hyperinsulinemic corpulent rats possess fewer hepatic insulin receptors than do lean rats. Using similar numbers of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (WGA)-purified insulin receptors with similar affinities for insulin, it was found that basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the synthetic tyrosine-specific kinase substrate poly(Glu, Tyr)4:1 was similar in lean and obese rats fed sucrose or starch. It is suggested that the contribution of the liver to the insulin resistance in obese SHR/N-cp rats probably lies distal to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.\r"

Non-fasting serum glucose levels were similar in all groups, but serum insulin level of DHEA-treated rats was 59% of that in CFA-treated and control rats. Results of glucose tolerance tests were not different among the groups. Mitochondrial state 3 and 4 rates expressed per g liver or per liver with either glutamate-malate or succinate as substrate were higher in DHEA-treated rats than in CFA-treated or control rats. Mitochondrial long-chain fatty acyl-CoA hydrolase activity was 8.5 and 4 times higher in DHEA- and CFA-treated rats, respectively, than in control rats. These results suggest that although DHEA and CFA affect some hepatic biochemical parameters similarly, they are distinct in their effects on body weight, serum insulin and mitochondrial respiration in obese Zucker rats.\r"

Where extracted teeth were available for examination, these cysts were usually associated with a developmental enamel projection or ridge extending into the buccal bifurcation. These developmental anomalies may be instrumental in the pathogenesis of paradental cysts. Although the paradental cyst may represent a distinct entity, a variant of the dentigerous cyst, or an occluded periodontal pocket, it is a useful descriptive term to explain the unique clinical, radiographic, and gross characteristics of this lesion.\r"

Initially, cartilage changes and possibly also changes in the synovial membrane set up a vicious cycle of cartilage breakdown accompanied by attempts at repair. When the degradative process exceeds the response of repair, the osteoarthrotic disorder progresses into clinically detectable stages. Frequently, the gliding capacity of the articular disc is also impaired, giving rise to an internal derangement. In this article, a concept is presented in which it is suggested that in many cases of craniomandibular pain and dysfunction TMJ osteoarthrosis is the basic disorder.\r"

Forty newborn infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension underwent conventional (two-dimensional and Doppler) echocardiography and color flow mapping. Of 25 candidates for ECMO therapy, 18 subsequently received it. Conventional echocardiography demonstrated normal pulmonary venous return in only 21 of the 40 patients. In all 40, however, color flow mapping demonstrated normal right and left pulmonary venous drainage entering the left atrium. In three other patients with total anomalous pulmonary venous return, conventional echocardiography demonstrated the anomalous pulmonary venous pathways, and color flow mapping did not show jets emanating from the left atrial wall; the left atrium was shown to fill exclusively from right to left shunting through the foramen ovale. We conclude that color flow mapping is superior to conventional echocardiography for verifying normal pulmonary venous return in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Twelve infants were in the surfactant group; seven infants received placebo (0.9% saline solution). There was no difference in the time of onset of spontaneous diuresis (as defined by output greater than or equal to 80% of intake). The glomerular filtration rate, determined by endogenous creatinine clearance, was also similar in the surfactant- and placebo-treated infants during the first 3 days of life. The fractional excretion of sodium was significantly higher in the placebo group at 24 hours and 36 hours. Infants in the placebo group had a higher negative sodium balance than those in the surfactant group. Ventilatory status improved significantly soon after surfactant treatment, as evidenced by improvement in the alveolar/arterial oxygen pressure ratio and by a lower mean airway pressure. These data suggest that ventilatory status can be improved without diuresis; the factors that regulate diuresis are multiple and not fully understood.\r"

(b) Always measure physical functioning, emotional functioning, symptoms (general and protocol specific), and global quality of life separately. (c) Include measures of social functioning and additional protocol-specific measures if resources permit. (d) Use patient-based questionnaires with psychometric properties that have been documented in published studies. In this review, we also recommend specific questionnaires. Our recommendations may prove useful for other cancer clinical trials groups and for multi-institution trials of treatment for chronic diseases.\r"

Ordinarily, successful aortic reconstruction can be performed with low risk to the pelvic kidney by use of readily available in situ cold perfusion. Two illustrative case reports applying this method are presented. The recently reported technique of double proximal clamping of the aorta was also employed in one case. This technique allows lumbar collaterals within the aneurysm to perfuse the kidney during construction of the proximal aortic anastomosis, thereby minimizing absolute renal ischemic time. Both in situ cold perfusion and double proximal clamping are effective methods for renal preservation that do not rely on complex extraanatomic techniques. A review of the literature with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of previously reported methods of renal preservation is presented.\r"

With this method we have now serially observed 35 renal arteries with 60% to 99% renal artery stenosis in 27 patients. Nineteen stenotic renal arteries in 15 patients were observed without intervention. There was a significant decrease in kidney size (mean difference - 1.0 cm; p less than 0.01; mean follow-up 13 months) but all 19 renal arteries remained patent. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed in five patients (six renal arteries) for renovascular hypertension. Renal duplex scanning documented relief of renal artery stenosis in two patients whose hypertension improved after PTA and confirmed residual 60% to 99% renal artery stenosis in three patients whose hypertension did not improve after PTA (mean follow-up 6.5 months). Aortorenal bypass was performed for 10 stenotic renal arteries in seven patients. At a mean follow-up of 9 months duplex ultrasound documented eight patent and two occluded aortorenal bypass grafts. Duplex ultrasound is useful both for defining the natural history of untreated renal artery stenosis and assessing the results of renal artery angioplasty or bypass.\r"

The abdominal aortas of five groups of rabbits were subjected to Fogarty balloon catheterization via the femoral artery. Some rabbits were killed immediately (time 0), and others were killed at weekly intervals. At time 0, isolated vascular rings sectioned from the abdominal aortas and suspended in tissue baths failed to exhibit any endothelial-derived relaxing factor dependent vascular relaxation. Vascular relaxation progressively returned but was not normal until 4 weeks after the initial injury. Morphologic changes studied by means of Evans blue dye and by scanning electron microscopy with silver staining corresponded well with these functional changes. At time 0, the delicate endothelium was completely denuded, but it progressively regenerated over the subsequent 4 weeks. This severe injury to the vascular endothelium and the resultant vascular dysfunction may result in an increased risk of early postoperative spasm and thrombosis after the use of a Fogarty balloon catheter.\r"

Previous determinations have depended on high-fidelity, invasive measurements of instantaneous pressure, volume, mass, and wall stress, which could not be done on a routine clinical basis. With the advent of Doppler echocardiography, intracardiac blood flow velocities can now be noninvasively assessed. For application of this technique to evaluation of diastolic function in patients with heart disease, it is necessary to understand what the Doppler-derived variables represent. It is also necessary to know how they are affected by changes in loading conditions and changes in myocardial relaxation. In this review, we provide an interpretation of the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and systemic and pulmonary venous inflow velocities in the normal patient and in various disease states.\r"

The mean prothrombin time was above normal in all three diagnostic groups, patients with CAH having the highest values. The mean activated partial thromboplastin time was normal in patients with PSC or PBC but elevated in those with CAH. Fibrinogen levels were above normal in patients with PBC but decreased in 1 patient (5%) with PSC and 10 (42%) with CAH. Mean platelet counts were below normal in 68% and 55% of patients with PSC and PBC, respectively, but in 96% of those with CAH. The mean Ivy bleeding time was normal in patients with PSC or PBC but prolonged in those with CAH. Patients with PSC or PBC had normal mean activity levels of factors II, V, VII, IX, and X, whereas those with CAH had below normal mean values for factors II and VII. The antithrombin III activity level was normal in patients with PSC or PBC but reduced in those with CAH. Thus, patients with CAH have a greater derangement in results of clotting studies in comparison with those who have PSC or PBC, but the use of blood did not differ among the three diagnostic groups.\r"

The major hemodynamic changes at the time of reperfusion of the donor liver were significant decreases in arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary artery temperature and significant increases in cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The alterations in laboratory values reflected intraoperative therapeutic manipulations. Citrate toxicity is a concern, and the amount of calcium chloride administered reflected the volume of blood transfused. On reperfusion, the fibrinogen concentration decreased and both the prothrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time increased. This coagulopathy was also evident in the thromboelastographic values. Aggressive monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to maintain hemodynamic and metabolic homeostasis in these patients.\r"

Rifampicin had a greater anti-pruritic effect than phenobarbitone. The symptom improved in 19 patients taking rifampicin and in 8 taking phenobarbitone, the degree of improvement being greater with rifampicin than with phenobarbitone. Pruritus disappeared in 9 patients receiving rifampicin, and three of them were free of itch when switching over to phenobarbitone. Both drugs were equally effective in inducing hepatic microsomal function but rifampicin has the additional effect of reducing cholestasis. Its anti-pruritic effect should be tested in long-term clinical trials.\r"

Age was an adverse factor (78% of deaths occurred among those aged over 70, who formed 46% of the study population), as was obstruction or perforation. 55% of deaths were due to cardiopulmonary complications. Educating patients to seek treatment early, careful preoperative assessment and postoperative monitoring of cardiopulmonary function, and, in selected patients, use of local treatments rather than wide resections may help to reduce mortality in elderly patients.\r"

If they are correct, this will be the first known instance of a common potentially lethal disease being preventable by extirpation of a piece of normal tissue. To reconcile the phenomenon with existing views of evolution and biology, it is suggested that the effects of one unphysiological intervention are counterbalancing those of another--ie, colonisation of the baby's gastrointestinal tract and genitals in maternity units by Escherichia coli strains of non-maternal origin, to which the baby has no passive immunity. As an alternative to circumcision to prevent early infantile male UTI, more natural colonisation could be promoted by strict rooming-in of mother and baby or by active colonisation of the baby with his mother's anaerobic gut flora.\r"

The predominant morbidity of beta 2M-amyloid was musculoskeletal, with deposits identified in surgical or biopsy specimens from trigger fingers, carpal tunnels, fractures, and radiolucent bone lesions. Lucent bone lesions were the characteristic radiologic finding of beta 2M-amyloidosis and were most commonly found in carpal bones, humeral heads, and femoral heads. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurred in greater than 20% of our chronic hemodialysis patients. The longer the period of time on chronic hemodialysis the greater the morbidity from beta 2M-amyloid. Although significant amounts of beta 2M-amyloid were detected in the perivascular regions of viscera, clinical compromise of internal organs from this type of amyloid was not documented. In acute studies, beta 2M clearance during hemodialysis was markedly increased using the Fresenius polysulfone dialyzers compared to cuprophane dialyzers. In summary, beta 2M-amyloid is common and causes significant morbidity in chronic hemodialysis patients. Long-term dialysis with highly permeable membranes effects greater beta 2M clearance which may result in less tissue deposition of beta 2M-amyloid, and therefore, fewer clinical complications.\r"

Although outbreaks of nosocomial pneumonia in immunosuppressed hosts have been well-described, most cases have occurred sporadically in the community. The spectrum of disease ranges from severe life-threatening pneumonia to a self-limiting febrile illness (Pontiac fever). Isolation from the natural aquatic environment has preceded its discovery as agents of human disease in 6 species, while environmental isolation has not yet been obtained for 3 species implicated in disease. The mode of transmission is uncertain, but cases of dual infection by L. pneumophila and the newer species suggests that the epidemiology of these new organisms will be similar to that of L. pneumophila. The antibiotic of choice appears to be erythromycin. The historical background, epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical manifestations of these newly-discovered organisms are reviewed in comparative fashion.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), the first autoimmune disease to be recognized, is a manifestation of defective immune regulation. Although often associated with a lymphoid neoplasm or an overt immunologic disorder, AIHA frequently appears without apparent cause. Many patients with the \"idiopathic\" disease have been found to have various immunologic abnormalities in addition to the antibodies reacting with red cells. Although familial AIHA is uncommon, other autoimmune diseases and serologic abnormalities have been encountered in relatives of numerous patients. Few detailed family studies have been performed, but the available data suggest that predisposition to AIHA and to the associated immunologic disorders often is genetically transmitted. Less information is available about autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, in part because of the historic difficulty in recognizing autoantibodies that react with platelets. However, there is good evidence for genetically determined predisposing factors in some cases. Using the BFP reaction as an indicator, we add to the evidence that AIHA and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, like SLE, tend to occur in persons with a long-standing occult immunologic defect that often has a genetic basis. In our studies, 11 patients with AIHA or ITP had BFP reactions. The serologic abnormality in 4 had been known to precede the blood disorder by 6 to 44 years. Five of the patients had an additional disease believed to have an immunologic pathogenesis. Serologic abnormalities apart from the BFP reaction and the red cell or platelet antibodies were demonstrated in 9. Autoimmune diseases or serologic changes are known to have affected relatives of 5 patients, including 4 who had 1 or more relatives with BFP reactions. Serologic tests for syphilis were negative in 2 sibs with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura whose father had a chronic BFP reaction and thyroiditis, but all 3 had low levels of IgA and IgM. Lymphoproliferative disorders appeared in 3 of the patients with BFP reactions, and 2 had relatives with lymphoid neoplasms. A lymphoma occurred in a woman with cold agglutinin disease 21 years after the discovery of the erythrocyte antibody. Our observations support the view that an abnormality of cells of the immune system, often genetically determined, may predispose to serologic changes, immune deficiency, autoimmune diseases and neoplasia.\r"

An enhanced computed tomographic scan of the neck is the technique of choice to demonstrate the thrombosis of the internal jugular vein.

This X-linked syndrome is the most common Mendelian form of mental retardation. Males who inherit the fra(X) chromosome are usually moderately to severely retarded. There are also normal carrier men who are nonpenetrant for the mutation. They transmit the mutation to their daughters, who can have affected sons. The development of methods for detecting fra(X) in blood and amniotic fluid cells has allowed for population screening and prenatal diagnosis of the syndrome. New methods using DNA probes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are being applied to study the inheritance of fra(X). They have revealed apparent genetic linkage heterogeneity. Molecular studies to analyze the underlying mutation are underway to define the structural basis.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial diseases, and particularly mitochondrial myopathies or encephalomyopathies, have drawn increasing attention in the past decade. Initially defined by morphologic changes in muscle (\"ragged red fibers\" and ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria), mitochondrial encephalomyopathies can now be classified according to biochemical defects involving: (1) mitochondrial transport; (2) substrate oxidation; (3) Krebs cycle; (4) respiratory chain; and (5) oxidation-phosphorylation coupling. For each biochemical group of disorders, the authors describe clinical presentations and biochemical findings. These disorders are especially interesting from the genetic point of view because mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 polypeptides, all of them subunits of respiratory chain complexes. Other mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into the mitochondria by a complex mechanism. Because mtDNA is inherited strictly by maternal, cytoplasmic inheritance, mitochondrial diseases can be transmitted by Mendelian or by non-Mendelian, maternal inheritance, as illustrated by human pathology.\r"

There are 10 well-defined biochemical defects of glycogen metabolism expressed in muscle and affecting the following enzymes: alpha 1,4 glucosidase (glycogenesis type II), debrancher enzyme (III), brancher enzyme (IV), phosphorylase (V), phosphofructokinase (VII), phosphorylase b kinase (VIII), phosphoglycerate kinase (IX), phosphoglycerate mutase (X), lactate dehydrogenase (XI). These disorders cause two main syndromes: one characterized by exercise intolerance with cramps and myoglobinuria, the other by fixed weakness. However, there are examples of clinical and biochemical heterogeneity for each disease, and molecular genetic analysis is already showing evidence of genetic heterogeneity. Although our understanding of the biochemical errors has progressed considerably, the pathogenesis of symptoms and signs remains incomplete.\r"

These disorders are system degenerations; many of them are specific entities clearly inherited as autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive traits. Although the clinical manifestations and neuropathologic findings of cerebellar disease dominate the spinocerebellar degenerations, there may also be characteristic changes in the basal ganglia, optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, or peripheral nerve disease. There are many gradations from pure cerebellar manifestations to mixed cerebellar and brain-stem disorders, cerebellar and basal ganglia syndromes, and spinal syndromes or peripheral nerve disease. The clinical picture may be consistent in one family, but sometimes there is a characteristic syndrome in the majority of family members and an entirely different disorder in one or several members.\r"

These signs are caused by abnormal intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol that enters cells from the circulation through the LDL receptor is not processed in a timely, normal manner by cells in parenchymal organs and the CNS. It therefore accumulates in toxic quantities as unesterified cholesterol causing cellular and tissue damage. Knowledge of the primary, consistent disturbance in cholesterol disposition has led to the development of tests to diagnose patients, identify heterozygotes, and assure the prenatal detection of these disorders. Therapeutic strategies include reduction of dietary cholesterol, apheresis techniques designed to reduce LDL cholesterol available to cells, and reduction of formation of LDL and increase of synthesis of HDL to lower cellular uptake of cholesterol and enhance egress of this lipid from intracellular storage sites. The development of procedures that block cholesterol formation but do not up-regulate LDL receptors on plasma cell membranes is considered to be highly important for the therapy of types C and D Niemann-Pick disease.\r"

The typical clinical characteristics are distal muscle weakness and atrophy, depressed tendon reflexes, often slow motor NCV, and the frequent finding of other similarly affected relatives. The most common variant of this syndrome is HMSN-I showing autosomal dominant inheritance, markedly slow motor NCV and nerve hypertrophy. One form of HMSN-I is linked to the Duffy locus on chromosome 1. There are numerous other varieties of HMSN including other autosomal dominant conditions such as HMSN-II (with nearly normal motor NCV) and several types of familial amyloid neuropathy (with specific amino acid substitutions in transthyretin); autosomal recessive conditions such as HMSN-III (Dejerine-Sottas hypertrophic neuropathy of childhood) and Refsum's disease (defect of phytanic acid metabolism); and conditions produced by mutations on the X chromosome such as X-linked HMSN, Fabry trihexoside storage disease, and adrenomyeloneuropathy. The known biochemical abnormalities, chromosomal locations, clinical findings and genetic counseling of these disorders are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "We randomly assigned 230 patients in sinus rhythm with moderately severe heart failure to treatment with digoxin, milrinone, both, or placebo. The effects of each were compared during a 12-week, double-blind trial. Treatment with milrinone or digoxin significantly increased treadmill exercise time as compared with placebo (by 82 and 64 seconds respectively; 95 percent confidence limits, 44 and 123, and 30 and 100). Both treatments reduced the frequency of decompensation from heart failure, from 47 percent with placebo to 34 percent with milrinone (P less than 0.05; 95 percent confidence limits, 22 and 46) and 15 percent with digoxin (P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence limits, 7 and 26). However, the clinical condition of 20 percent of the patients taking milrinone deteriorated within two weeks after treatment was begun, as compared with only 3 percent of those taking digoxin (P less than 0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was not significantly changed by milrinone (+0.2 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -1.5 and 1.9), but it was increased by digoxin (+1.7 percent; P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence limits, -0.03 and 3.4) and decreased by placebo (-2.0 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -3.8 and -0.1). Three-month survival was related inversely to the base-line ejection fraction. Analysis of mortality from all causes according to the intention to treat suggested an adverse effect of milrinone (P = 0.064). After adjustment for an excess of patients with lower ejection fractions randomly assigned to receive milrinone, this trend was not significant (P = 0.26). Increased ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently in patients who received milrinone than in those who did not (18 vs. 4 percent; P less than 0.03). We conclude that milrinone significantly increased exercise tolerance and reduced the frequency of worsened heart failure. However, in the population of patients studied, milrinone or the combination of milrinone and digoxin offered no advantage over digoxin alone. Furthermore, our data suggest that milrinone may aggravate ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

One group of 32 subjects was defined as having hyperinsulinemia (serum insulin, greater than 2 SD above the mean) and then compared with 32 normoinsulinemic subjects (serum insulin within 1 SD of the mean) matched for age (mean, 39 years), sex (22 men and 10 women), and body-mass index (24.7). The two groups had similar patterns of smoking, drinking, and physical exercise. Plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose challenge were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the hyperinsulinemic group. In addition, the mean (+/- SEM) fasting plasma triglyceride levels in subjects with hyperinsulinemia were significantly higher (1.73 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.24 +/- 0.1 mmol per liter) and the plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were lower (1.21 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.06 mmol per liter) than in subjects with normoinsulinemia. Both systolic (126 vs. 119 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) and diastolic (85 vs. 78 mm Hg; P less than 0.01) blood pressures were significantly elevated in the group with hyperinsulinemia. We conclude that healthy persons with hyperinsulinemia and normal glucose tolerance have an increase in risk factors for coronary artery disease, as compared with a well-matched group of healthy subjects with normal insulin levels.\r"

Thus, the clinical history of the disease that emerges from published studies could be influenced by a bias in patient selection. In the present study, we compared the clinical features of an outpatient population of 25 patients who had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with those reported in 78 studies published during the past five years. In the 25 study patients, age, sex, and the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as the prevalence of diastolic filling abnormalities, subaortic obstruction, and ventricular arrhythmias, were similar to those in patients described in the literature. Cardiac symptoms, however, were much less severe in the study patients. Eighteen patients (72 percent) were asymptomatic, six (24 percent) had mild symptoms, and only one (4 percent) had moderate-to-severe symptoms. Of 24 patients followed for a mean period of 4.4 years (range, 2.9 to 5.7), none died or had clinical deterioration. Of 3404 patients described in the 78 studies we reviewed, 2483 (73 percent) came from only two referral institutions. Of the 1721 patients in whom severity of symptoms was reported, 757 (44 percent) had moderate-to-severe symptoms. However, 727 (96 percent) of these patients were studied at one of the same two referral institutions. We conclude that the natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be more benign than can be inferred from published reports.\r"

Patellofemoral symptoms are usually related to mechanical malalignment of all three components of the total knee arthroplasty. Attention to the fundamental principles of total knee arthroplasty, including restoration of the bony mechanical alignment, soft tissue stability, and maintenance of the anatomic joint line, prevents many of the problems. Meticulous preoperative planning and anatomic placement of the component parts are important for a satisfactory long-term outcome. Present research is directed to providing kinematic analysis of the patellofemoral tracking mechanism and to minimizing patellofemoral contact stresses with appropriate new designs.\r"

These serve to foster and perpetuate the conflicts that inform the various theoretical perspectives and associated beliefs held by professionals in the addictions field. Addiction is more than a toxic state, a criminal offense, a disease, a mental health problem, or an unhealthy habit. It is also a social problem that affects every aspect of life--physical, psychological, and interpersonal. Given this fact, it is unlikely that one perspective can sufficiently guide the treatment of addicted clients. Thus, care of addicted clients must be based on a model of health-illness that is inclusive and flexible, yet distinct and relevant. Such a model must accommodate the reality that health or illness is the outcome of multiple personal characteristics that interact with a host of interdependent factors within the larger social environment. Nurses, because of their holistic and client-centered focus, are uniquely prepared to provide care to addicted clients.\r"

Maintenance and restoration of function are best accomplished within a framework that considers the psychosocial and developmental needs of the geriatric patient and in a setting specifically intended for the geriatric rehabilitation patient. Unlike the rehabilitation process in younger age groups, which is often dramatic, successful work with geriatric patients is likely to be subtle, but it will result in a return to the community and allow patients to experience a higher level of satisfaction (both emotional and functional) at the end of their lives. The needs of this population are many, and the health care provider must consider disease, physiologic changes associated with aging, and developmental needs when planning and implementing care. Initial research has pointed to the efficacy of geriatric rehabilitation programs; this would seem to indicate a need for a true specialization in geriatrics within the field of rehabilitation.\r"

  ".W": "The 1980s have been declared the decade of the disabled. Surgeon General Koop has stated that \"it is profoundly important for our own society that we tend to these issues of disabled children, that these children not be forgotten or pushed aside, and that we retain our belief in the strength of the American family\". The field of pediatric rehabilitation, unheard of as recently as the late 1970s, has become a recognized specialty. The definition of pediatric rehabilitation has expanded to include the care and treatment of children with congenital and acquired disabilities. The pediatric rehabilitation nurse is challenged to keep abreast of new developments in the field while seeking and implementing innovative ways to assist the child and family in their adjustment to the child's disability. A knowledge base of normal growth and development is essential when assessing abnormal patterns in the child with a disability. Complete assessment of the child with a disability includes a parent-child interview and physical assessment, with particular focus on the child's developmental age, movement patterns, and functional activities of daily living. The reaction of the child and family to the disability is all too often viewed as lack of \"acceptance\" of the child's disability. A continuum of \"adjustment\" to the disability for both family and child describes normal coping mechanisms for living with and managing the needs of a disabled child. It is important for the pediatric rehabilitation nurse to develop a partnership with parents in which they serve as consultants to families, not as directors of the child's care. Cerebral palsy and spina bifida are the two most common childhood disabilities. With advanced technologic equipment and refined surgical procedures, the child's potential for independence is reaching new heights. Computerized technology has aided the motor-impaired child to progress through normal developmental processes of exploration and discovery. Specialized health procedures such as tube feedings and clean intermittent catherization have become routine for many children and their families. Advanced technology has also benefited the child who is ventilator dependent, although not without some limitations to the child, family, and society. Limited financial and psychosocial resources create a burden on both the family and society as the child continues to require high technology care. The relatively new field of head-injury rehabilitation provides an arena for pediatric rehabilitation nurses to define specific interventions for the child who is rapidly evolving through the stages of cognitive and motor recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Disability has demonstrable impact on sexuality and must be taken into account by nurses concerned with rehabilitative approaches to clients with disabilities. Self-assessment by professionals of their attitudes and feelings about sexuality was encouraged. Some strategies were offered by which nurses can define and identify their level of involvement in the sexual counseling of disabled clients. Assessment and information for selected interventions were discussed, as were emerging issues requiring further exploration. The nurse's role as it relates to sexuality in persons with disabilities is to assist clients to find, implement, and integrate their beliefs and behaviors into a healthy and satisfying lifestyle.\r"

Increased publicity has enabled family and friends of eating disordered individuals to recognize the disease and seek help for them from trained medical professionals. Everyone is \"at risk,\" but certain subpopulations have been \"coming out of the closet\" in epidemic proportions. An ever-increasing number of high school-aged and college-aged females have developed some form of eating disorder, from fad diets to self-induced vomiting. In these individuals, the obsession with thinness takes priority over family, friends, schoolwork, or career. Strangely enough, the eating disordered person's addiction is not to food but to the feeling of numbness her behavior brings. Over time, the need to control is desperately sought and many patients transfer their obsession to other patterns of self-abuse. Nursing intervention should include setting the appropriate example in terms of the professional's relationship with food, while providing much needed emotional support. An innovative method of intervention available to nursing professionals includes the use of creative, visual imagery to repeatedly diffuse fear and anxiety about food until a level of personal autonomy over the disorder and other emotional concerns is achieved. Therefore, a system of recovery can be designed for the anorectic or bulimic patient and the experience of recovery from the eating disorder can be a lifelong process of personal growth.\r"

The focus of treatment is most appropriately on learning new, more constructive ways for solving problems. Everyday living skills can best be learned in a therapeutic milieu where interactions in the here-and-now are examined and opportunities are present for practicing problem-solving skills. A therapeutic milieu can be designed and initiated through efforts of the nursing staff and members of other disciplines. It is a group treatment approach emphasizing active participation in structured activities, decision-making by consensus involving all members of the community, and a reward and restriction system based on the appropriateness of client behaviors. Certain problem behaviors of addicted clients can be addressed through confrontation and group pressure; to be expected are problems with manipulation, avoidance, aggression, impulsiveness, and grandiose denial. Staff members who work in a therapeutic milieu approach to treatment of addicted clients share certain concerns. Strategies need to be developed for dealing with manipulative attempts at splitting the staff into opposing forces, clarifying roles, enforcing unit policies, and lessening feelings of hopelessness when clients fail to achieve sobriety. A cohesive staff who work at trusting each other in an atmosphere of open communication and equitable conflict resolution are best able to support each other while addressing common concerns. While treatment in a therapeutic milieu is an effective beginning in the process of recovery, it must be remembered that it is only a beginning in the long, slow process of rehabilitation. And during that process, there are likely to be relapses, which can be used as learning tools in the development of improved problem-solving skills.\r"

Intervention presents reality in a manner that penetrates the maladaptive defense mechanisms that have developed around this illness, both in the person who is thought to be chemically dependent and in those significant in his or her life. The process begins with the nurse assessing the extent of the problem and the likelihood that chemical dependency is the cause, or at least the primary factor. The nurse assists in identifying the persons to be involved in the intervention and the ability of the individuals and the group to carry out the intervention process. Education and preparation of the group are the next steps. Once the group is adequately prepared, the intervention is implemented. Throughout the process, the nurse is cautioned to remember (1) the patient/client is the person seeking assistance, not the person thought to be chemically dependent, and (2) he or she is a facilitator, not an intervener. Follow-up to the actual intervention is also important, ensuring the evaluation is completed, encouraging the individuals in the group to follow through with the prepared plans, and assisting them in dealing with the feelings they experience as a result of the intervention. Nurses often function as intervention facilitators. Because intervention is so powerful, preparation as a facilitator requires sound knowledge of the illness and the process and supervised clinical experience.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated roles of methylation in bacterial chemotaxis by characterizing a methyl-accepting transducer protein incapable of methylation because of amino acid substitutions at the modification sites. Mutant Trg protein recognized ligand and generated excitatory signals that affected flagella but was unable to mediate efficient adaptation or net cellular migration in a relevant chemical gradient. Defects caused by lack of methyl-accepting sites on Trg were suppressed by a sufficient cellular content of other transducer molecules with functional methyl-accepting sites. These observations establish directly that methylation is crucial for transducer-mediated chemotaxis and that neither phosphotransfer reactions among the soluble Che proteins nor other interaction among those chemotactic components can effectively fulfill the functions of methylation. Suppression was correlated with adaptational \"crosstalk\" in which unoccupied methyl-accepting transducers acquired methyl groups, thus apparently substituting effectively for blocked methyl-accepting sites on the transducer. A plausible model for this phenomenon is that increased methylation of unstimulated transducers results from global inhibition of the demethylating enzyme in a cell with a normally active methyltransferase and no available methyl-accepting sites on the stimulated, mutant transducer. Thus methylation can perform its roles in adaptation and gradient sensing even if modification occurs on molecules different from those that recognize the stimulating compound. This observation emphasizes the central role of methylation and the modular nature of the chemosensory system.\r"

Viruses were administered per os to larvae of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, causing an infection that within 5 days resulted in the production of approximately 0.15 mg of HBsAg per insect, representing 1.5% of the total extracted protein, or approximately 2.8 mg of NA per insect, representing 28% of the total extractable protein. The HBsAg and NA produced by infected larvae were purified from insect lysates. These proteins were antigenic as determined by conformation-dependent immunoassays. The NA was enzymatically active with conventional substrates. The method of infection described allows genetic complementation by wild-type virus of recombinant viruses lacking the polyhedrin gene essential for infection per os and has implications for the high-yield production in insect larvae of other recombinant proteins of baculoviruses.\r"

To investigate the signals required for this processing we constructed a chimeric cDNA. The latter was designed to code for a truncated precursor form of PLAP, containing the phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment site but incapable of any form of membrane attachment, fused to a carboxyl-terminal peptide of vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein. Expression of the PLAP-vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein chimeric cDNA in transfected COS cells produced an enzymatically active protein that was attached to the plasma membrane, with the PLAP domain on the outer surface. Assays for the presence of phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment proved negative, whereas an antibody assay confirmed the presence of the vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein carboxyl-terminal peptide, leading to the conclusion that the truncated PLAP is attached to the cells by the membrane-spanning domain of the vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein. In light of previous findings on carboxyl-terminal requirements of PLAP these studies suggest that an essential signal for correct sorting between transmembrane insertion and phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment resides in the cytoplasmic domain.\r"

Although the gene-enriched strain has higher glutathione levels than the wild strain, the observed radioresistance appears to be associated with the increased capacity of the gene-enriched strain to synthesize glutathione when irradiated rather than to the cellular levels of glutathione per se. Thus, resistance was abolished in the presence of buthionine sulfoximine, a selective inactivator of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase that decreases glutathione synthesis but that does not act directly to lower cellular glutathione levels. Conclusions drawn from studies on this E. coli model system may have relevance to protection of mammalian cells by glutathione.\r"

TGF alpha-like proteins have been proposed to play a role in oncogenesis and wound healing. This report describes sequence-specific 1H-NMR resonance assignments for recombinant human TGF alpha (hTGF alpha). These assignments provide the basis for interpreting NMR data which demonstrate that the solution structure of hTGF alpha includes an antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues Gly-19 to Leu-24 and Lys-29 to Cys-34 and a second, smaller, antiparallel beta-sheet involving residues Tyr-38 and Val-39 and His-45 and Ala-46. These data, together with constraints imposed by the disulfide bonds, are combined to construct a molecular model of the polypeptide chain fold for residues Cys-8 to Ala-46. The resulting structure is similar to that of mouse and human EGF. Human TGF alpha and mouse EGF, however, differ with respect to their structural dynamics, since amide proton/deuteron exchange is much faster for hTGF alpha than for mouse EGF at pH 3.5.\r"

To track the expression of the gene, a small sequence encoding the antigenic portion of neuropeptide substance P was inserted in frame 5' to the TGA translation stop codon of the gene. Surprisingly, this gene was expressed promiscuously in a wide variety of cultured cells transiently transfected with the construct. In contrast, when introduced into the germ line of transgenic mice, the construct was expressed in a fashion analogous to the endogenous K14 gene--namely, in the basal layer of stratified squamous epithelia. Our results suggest that some regulatory mechanism is overridden as a consequence of transient transfection but that sequences that can control proper K14 expression are present in the construct. The appropriate tissue-specific and differentiation-specific expression of K14.P in transgenic mice is an important first step in characterizing a promoter that could be employed to drive the foreign expression of drug-related genes in the epidermis of skin grafts.\r"

The response was quantitated by radioimmunoassay and by [3H]arachidonate labeling followed by analysis of the secreted prostaglandins. The stimulated secretion lasts for several minutes and is optimal at 2-4 min. The dose-response (peak at 1-10 ng/ml) is similar to that previously observed for activation of endothelial cell phospholipase C. Stimulated secretion was blocked by pretreatment with the inhibitors of prostacyclin synthesis, indomethacin and tranylcypromine, and also the specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, quinacrine, as well as pertussis toxin and the diglyceryl and monoglyceryl lipase inhibitor RHC 80267. Stimulated secretion was also abolished in cells that were either pretreated for 48 hr with phorbol ester to down-regulate protein kinase C or incubated with the protein kinase inhibitor H7. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol by phospholipase A2 appears to be the source of angiogenin-mobilized arachidonate; angiogenin-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine was not detected. Activation of phospholipase A2 occurs in the absence of an angiogenin-induced calcium flux. The results are discussed in terms of mechanisms of agonist-induced intracellular arachidonate mobilization and relevance to angiogenesis.\r"

Fifty human YACs from a hamster-human cell hybrid with only the Xq24-Xq28 portion of the X chromosome include one that contains two anonymous probe sequences, DX13 and St14, previously inferred by indirect means to lie within about 70 kb of one another in Xq28. The YACs specific for human DNA arise at a frequency equivalent to the fraction of cellular DNA that is human-specific. Furthermore, the human YACs, formed in a 280-fold excess of hamster DNA, do not hybridize to a hamster DNA probe, indicating that individual YACs do not contain a combination of human and hamster DNA. To confirm that sequences are not scrambled, the YACs containing V kappa I or DX13 and St14 sequences were shown to produce restriction fragments identical in mobility to fragments detected by the same probes in total human DNA digested with the same enzymes. YACs may therefore provide large clones to bridge gene mapping at the chromosome level to molecular analyses of small fragments of genomic DNA.\r"

Sequence analysis demonstrated that tumorigenic MCAC116/39 cells, known by DNA-mediated transfection to contain an activated c-Ki-ras oncogene, had a G----T transversion in the first position of codon 12 of this gene, resulting in a Gly12----Cys mutation. A combination of polymerase chain-reaction amplification and oligonucleotide hybridization demonstrated that three additional tumorigenic MCA transformants of C3H/10T1/2 cells had an identical mutation in the c-Ki-ras gene. In contrast, this mutation was not present in an MCA-induced C3H/10T 1/2 transformant that was not tumorigenic. The molecular specificity of this MCA-induced mutation resulting in C3H/10T1/2 tumorigenic transformants should provide an excellent system in which to study the roles of transcription, replication, repair, and exogenous factors in the establishment and expression of transformation and tumorigenicity.\r"

Fixed antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were incubated with various concentrations of each peptide and suboptimal concentrations of stimulator peptides. The binding of the CS peptides to DR5 or DRw6 proteins was then determined in a proliferation assay using two established DR5 or DRw6-restricted T-cell clones with specificity for the stimulator peptides as responder cells. One of five CS peptides, comprising together about 50% of the CS protein sequence, was found to compete with the binding of the stimulator peptides to DR5 and DRw6. The CS peptide CS-(378-398), binding to DR5 and DRw6, was then shown to be able to induce primary in vitro responses of T cells from donors with DR5 and DRw6 haplotypes. CS-(378-398)-induced T-cell clones responded not only to the homologous peptide but also to the native CS protein in the presence of appropriate APCs. The strategy we have applied is of considerable general interest for the engineering of vaccines against any pathogen, since it greatly facilitates the selection of appropriate T-cell epitopes to be incorporated in the vaccine.\r"

Therapy with analogs was initiated 24 weeks after initial administration of BOP. These treatments resulted in significantly better survival of all animals as compared to BOP controls; body weights of surviving peptide-treated animals were significantly higher than those of the BOP controls. All 15 BOP-control animals had pancreatic cancers. In the group treated with RC-160 four hamsters were free of tumors, whereas therapy with [D-Trp6]LH-RH resulted in seven tumor-free animals, and combination of RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH resulted in eight tumor-free animals from groups of 15. Only preblastomatous lesions were found in these animals. Average tumor weight of animals in all peptide-treated groups, sacrificed 60 days after beginning the peptide treatment, was significantly lower than that of BOP controls. No significant differences were seen between the various peptide-treated groups. Histologically, analog-treated tumors of hamsters showed striking regressive changes characteristic of programmed cell death (apoptosis). This apoptosis presumably resulted from hormonal effects on tumor cells from prolonged treatment with these analogs of hypothalamic hormones. Our present data confirm the beneficial effect of long-acting microcapsules of [D-Trp6]LH-RH and RC-160 on pancreatic carcinoma and suggest a mode of action for these peptides. The feasibility of applying this treatment with analogs of hypothalamic hormones to human pancreatic carcinoma can be envisioned from these studies.\r"

Recently, new LH-RH antagonists [Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-Phe(pCl)2,D-Trp3,D-Hci6,D-Ala10]-LH-RH (SB-29) and [Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-Phe(pCl)2,D-Trp3,D-Cit6,D-Ala10]LH-RH (SB-30), which are devoid of edematogenic effects, were synthesized. In this study, we examined whether these LH-RH antagonists inhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumor cells in culture. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell number were measured. The antagonists induced up to 40% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in MDA-MB-231 cells. This inhibition was dose-dependent in the 0.3-30 microM range and could be demonstrated after 2 days of incubation in the presence of the peptides. An older antagonist, [Ac-D-Phe(pCl)1,2,D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10]-LH-RH (ORG 30276), had a lesser effect, and the agonist des-Gly10-[D-Ser(tBu)6]LH-RH ethylamide (buserelin) had no effect. The antagonists SB-29 and SB-30 also inhibited the rate of cell growth, as measured by cell number, while the LH-RH agonist buserelin had no significant effect. These results support the concept that these new LH-RH antagonists can directly inhibit the growth of human mammary tumors and thus might be suitable for the treatment of breast cancer.\r"

We report here that Xenopus oocytes injected with NCB-20 cell poly(A)+ RNA express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated channels and that these channels include the PCP receptor site. In injected oocytes, NMDA application evoked a partially desensitizing inward current that was potentiated by glycine, blocked by the competitive antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, blocked by Mg2+ and by Zn2+, and blocked in a use-dependent manner by the PCP receptor ligands PCP and MK-801. There was little or no response to kainate or quisqualate (agonists of the other excitatory amino acid receptors), to gamma-aminobutyric acid (an inhibitory transmitter), or to glycine (an inhibitory transmitter as well as an allosteric potentiator of NMDA channels). Thus, NMDA/PCP receptors expressed from NCB-20 cell mRNA exhibit properties similar to those of the neuronal receptors. The absence of expression of other excitatory amino acid receptors in this system makes it particularly useful for study of NMDA-evoked responses without interference from responses mediated by other receptors. Moreover, NCB-20 mRNA may be an appropriate starting material for cloning the cDNA(s) encoding the NMDA/PCP-receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone is an effective agent for all types of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias regardless of mechanism and may, in fact, control a high percentage of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic agents. However, its toxicity should temper enthusiasm for the use of the medication in non-life-threatening arrhythmias. As always, when recommending specific therapies the potential benefit should be weighed in light of the related risk. In patients with life disordering, drug-refractory atrial fibrillation, it seems reasonable to attempt control with amiodarone. Likewise in patients with ectopic atrial tachycardias refractory to conventional agents, this seems reasonable as well. Other and better therapies are available for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. While amiodarone is moderately effective in these patients, the advent of improved surgical techniques and the relatively low risk of an operation make surgery the treatment of choice. The role of IV amiodarone, acutely, in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias remains to be defined.\r"

By screening for touch-insensitive mutants, it has been possible to identify 18 genes (represented by 417 mutations) that are required at various stages in the developmental program for touch cell differentiation. Two of the genes are needed for the generation of precursors in the touch cell lineages; without the precursors, touch cells are not made. A third gene, mec-3, specifies the differentiation of the touch cells, probably by acting as a transcription factor. The remaining 15 genes are likely targets of mec-3 action; mutants defective in these genes have nonfunctioning, yet differentiated, touch cells. Some of these latter genes are needed for the formation of cell-specific components of the touch cells, such as a set of microtubules that are only found in these cells. The study of the touch genes should help us understand how touch cell fate is determined, how microtubule form is specified, and, perhaps, how mechanical stimuli are transduced.\r"

The receptor molecule is potentially highly glycosylated, and contains an apparent transmembrane region. Analysis of messenger RNA transcripts reveals a predominantly lymphoid distribution in direct relation to the cell surface expression of the MEL-14 determinant, and the cDNA clone is shown to confer the MEL-14 epitope in heterologous cells. The many novel features, including ubiquitination, embodied in this single receptor molecule form the basis for numerous approaches to the study of cell-cell interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The molecules with which the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor interacts to elicit the biochemical reactions responsible for cell proliferation have not been identified. Antisera directed against specific PDGF receptor peptides coprecipitated a phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase and the PDGF receptor. Immunoprecipitates from PDGF-stimulated cells contained 10 to 50 times as much PI kinase as those from unstimulated cells. Mutation of the PDGF receptor by deletion of its kinase insert region resulted in a receptor markedly less effective than the wild type in eliciting cell proliferation and defective in PDGF-stimulated PI kinase, but still capable of PDGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These data show that the PDGF receptor is physically associated with a PDGF-sensitive PI kinase that is distinct from tyrosine kinase and is not required for PDGF-induced PI hydrolysis. The finding that the mutant PDGF receptor missing the kinase insert domain elicited known early biochemical responses to PDGF, but did not associate with or regulate PI kinase, suggests a novel role for the receptor-associated PI kinase in the transmission of mitogenic signals.\r"

A hydrophobic domain located at the COOH-terminus is required for anchor attachment; DAF molecules lacking this domain are secreted. Replacement of the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain with a signal peptide that normally functions in membrane translocation, or with a random hydrophobic sequence, results in efficient and correct processing, producing GPI-anchored DAF on the cell surface. The structural requirements for GPI anchor attachment and for membrane translocation are therefore similar, presumably depending on overall hydrophobicity rather than specific sequences.\r"

Conceptual schemes have been based on either the properties of single cells or of individual synapses. For instance, the intrinsic oscillatory properties of individual thalamic neurons are thought to underlie thalamic spindle rhythms. This issue has been pursued with a computer model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus that is based on known cellular and synaptic properties. Over a wide range of parameters, this model generates a rhythmic activity at a frequency faster than the firing of individual cells. During each rhythmic event, a few cells fire while most other cells receive synchronous synaptic inputs. This activity resembles the hippocampal theta rhythm as well as synchronized synaptic events observed in vitro. The amplitude and frequency of this emergent rhythmic activity depend on intrinsic cellular properties and the connectivity and strength of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.\r"

Previous studies showed that this reaction is nearly or fully rate limited by the hydrogen-transfer step. Semiclassical mass considerations that do not include tunneling effects would predict that kH/kT = (kD/kT)3.26, where kH, kD, and kT are the rate constants for the reaction of protium, deuterium, and tritium derivatives, respectively. Significant deviations from this relation have now been observed for both primary and especially secondary effects, such that experimental H/T ratios are much greater than those calculated from the above expression. These deviations also hold in the temperature range from 0 to 40 degrees Celsius. Such deviations were previously predicted to result from a reaction coordinate containing a significant contribution from hydrogen tunneling.\r"

S1 nuclease protection assays revealed that transfection of full-length raf complementary DNA in the antisense orientation (AS) leads to a specific reduction (greater than tenfold) of steady-state levels of the endogenous c-raf-1 sense (S) transcript in SQ-20B cells. In nude mice, the malignant potential of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (S) was significantly increased relative to that of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (AS). SQ-20B cells containing transfected raf (S) maintained a radiation-resistant phenotype as compared to those cells harboring the AS version, which appeared to have enhanced radiation sensitivity. These data indicate that the reduced expression of endogenous c-raf-1 is sufficient to modulate the tumorigenicity and the radiation-resistant phenotype of SQ-20B cells, thus implicating c-raf-1 in a pathway important to the genesis of this type of cancer.\r"

Stringent selection for neo expression by homologous recombination (3 of 11 correctly targeted) was achieved by fusing the SV40 large T antigen gene, in frame, to neo in a promoterless construct, such that G418 resistance depended on endogenous promoter function and read-through transcription. Chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT) with G418 selection was then used generate mouse hybrids that carried the targeted locus intact, but retained only a fragment of human chromosome 7. This gene targeting strategy will access new regions of the human (or other mammalian) genome, create precise mutations efficiently by gene disruption, and potentially restore normal gene function by mutation correction.\r"

All patients had a poor outcome; three died and three had end-stage renal disease. Eight patients (group 2) were treated with repeated pulses of 1 gm of IVMP for four to 21 months. Six of the eight patients had a favorable outcome, with four in complete remission and two in partial remission. One of the eight patients had partial response with stable renal disease at 16 months after pulse therapy. Only one patient had no response, with gradual worsening of renal function. All patients in both groups had rapid improvement of levels of anti-DNA and CH50 after pulse therapy was started. Patients in group 2 were compared to 21 randomized patients (group 3) with comparable severity of disease. Renal function deteriorated in group 3, with a mean duration of disease of 82.5 +/- 56.4 months. Renal function improved in group 2, with a mean duration of disease of 87.8 +/- 46.8 months. We conclude that repeated monthly pulse therapy with IVMP in severe SLE was effective and that major side effects can be avoided with proper timing of pulsing.\r"

  ".W": "Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) provides additional information regarding patency or occlusion of vessels that is not always detected by conventional angiography. Patency of distal vessels is a positive prognostic factor in predicting salvage of the foot in patients having various treatment procedures for occlusive atherosclerotic disease. I evaluated the ability of intra-arterial DSA to add important diagnostic and prognostic information concerning the vascular anatomy of the ankle and foot in 42 patients whose initial conventional diagnostic arteriogram was inadequate. Patency of foot vessels indicates a high likelihood of success in patients having revascularization, and absence of flow to the foot indicates that amputation is likely to be required.\r"

  ".W": "Several surveys during the 1970s showed a decline in the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Psychosurgery, insulin coma, and continuous sleep treatment are widely assumed to be in total disuse. This is the first comprehensive survey on the use of physical treatments in psychiatry in the southern United States. Seventy-five percent of 315 surveys sent to psychiatric medical directors and chief residents were returned. ECT was used in 89% of training hospitals, 57% of Veterans Administration hospitals, and 44% of private hospitals, but only 19% of state hospitals within the last year. None of the 19 state hospitals begun since 1970 had started ECT services. Moreover, state hospitals abandoned ECT at a higher rate than private hospitals. The lack of this service in the public sector is a result of sociolegal pressure rather than lack of confidence or enthusiasm for ECT. The other physical treatments were reported to be in almost total disuse.\r"

It summarizes the psychiatric symptoms associated with members of high-risk groups, patients who have AIDS-related complex (ARC) or AIDS, and patients who are seropositive yet asymptomatic. It differentiates between psychiatric manifestations predating and following prodromal symptoms of immunodeficiency and elucidates diagnostic criteria that may assist in this differentiation process. The importance of diagnostic distinction between premorbid, reactive, functional, and neuropsychiatric manifestations is emphasized. A brief description of suggested treatment and management regimens for the various forms of AIDS-related psychopathology then follows.\r"

We suggest endoscopic evaluation of the second and third portions of the duodenum in all such patients. At surgery, direct inspection of the duodenal lumen or the confirmation of its patency by passage of a Foley balloon should be routine. If a duodenal web is encountered, the procedure of choice should be duodenostomy with simple excision of the web.\r"

The precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain speculative.\r"

A review of 46 other cases of this association has shown that patients having MLNS with gallbladder hydrops are older than those without gallbladder hydrops. The diagnosis is suggested by abdominal symptoms and abnormal results of liver function tests. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasonography, which shows the gallbladder to be twice the normal size. Cardiac complications may be increased. Treatment is largely supportive, but cholecystostomy is the procedure of choice in cases requiring operative intervention.\r"

The resultant height change may be of use in the prediction of respiratory function.\r"
