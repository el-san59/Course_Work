  ".W": "In an effort to determine which blood elements play a critical role in the development of cerebral vasospasm, adult cats were subjected to prepontine injection of either autogenous whole blood or erythrocyte-free blood containing latex beads as a substitute morphologic marker. Seven or 10 days later the cats were anesthetized and perfused with fixative, and the basilar arteries were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Successful clot deposition was confirmed by the presence of numerous erythrocytes or latex beads within the adventitia of vessels. In agreement with previous studies, instillation of whole blood produced luminal narrowing associated with profound ultrastructural changes in all layers of the vascular wall. No significant alterations, however, occurred in arteries bathed in erythrocyte-free blood. These findings suggest first, that erythrocytes are essential for the development of the vasculopathy associated with chronic cerebral vasospasm, and second, that the role, if any, of other blood elements is not autonomous.\r"

  ".U": "88100735\r", 
  ".W": "The nature of alpha-adrenergic receptors in human cerebral arteries was characterized, and alteration of these receptors after subarachnoid hemorrhage was examined using a radioligand binding assay. Norepinephrine content of control arteries was also analyzed and compared with that of arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Norepinephrine content in human cerebral arteries in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage was about 5% of the control group. Specific binding of [3H]yohimbine, a selective alpha 2-antagonist, to cerebral arteries of the control group indicated two classes of binding sites: high-affinity sites with KD of 0.5 nM and Bmax of 18 fmol/mg protein and low-affinity sites with KD of 29 nM and Bmax of 248 fmol/mg protein. In cerebral arteries obtained from the subarachnoid hemorrhage group, [3H]yohimbine binding sites were of a single class with KD of 53 nM and Bmax of 456 fmol/mg protein. These results suggest that sympathetic denervation and subsequent alterations in alpha 2-adrenergic receptors occurred after subarachnoid hemorrhage in human cerebral arteries. These changes in sympathetic innervation to cerebral arteries were considered to be one of the antecedents of delayed vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

We report a similar relation in two hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys with severe cerebral atherosclerosis. In our primate model hypertension is induced by surgical coarctation of the aorta. These monkeys, when fed an atherogenic diet, develop severe cerebrovascular atherosclerosis. In this setting two monkeys developed spontaneous cerebral hemispheric strokes that occurred during treatment of hypertension. Since the strokes were topographically related to severe atherosclerotic narrowing of cerebral arteries and occurred without evidence of either thrombosis or embolization, they are presumed to be related to disturbances of blood flow. In both humans and animals cerebral perfusion is autoregulated to a constant flow over a wide range of mean arterial blood pressures. In hypertension both the upper and lower limits of autoregulation are increased. With treatment of hypertension readaptation to more normal levels is reported to be inconsistent and slow to develop. It is therefore postulated that the strokes in these two monkeys were due to hypoperfusion as a result of the combination of pharmacologic reduction in blood pressure and severe occlusive atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied whether the biomechanical properties of brain play an important role in the development of early ischemic brain edema in cats with middle cerebral artery occlusion. Brain tissue pressure, tissue compliance, and tissue resistance were measured from the gray matter in the core and the periphery of the middle cerebral artery territory for 6 hours after occlusion. Regional cerebral blood flow and water content were also measured from the same areas. Ventricular fluid pressure was recorded. Tissue pressure rose gradually in the core, where flow was 6 ml/100 g/min, over 4 hours and then stabilized. The pressure gradient measured between edematous tissue and ventricular fluid was 5.3 mm Hg. Tissue resistance increased 1 hour after occlusion when water content increased to 10 mg/g. Later, when water content increased by 40 mg/g, tissue resistance decreased and tissue compliance increased significantly. In the periphery, where flow was 17.6 ml/100 g/min, tissue pressure rose slightly while tissue compliance and tissue resistance did not change within 6 hours. Our data indicate that as ischemic injury progresses, edema fluid accumulates in highly compliant brain parenchyma, then migrates through highly conductive tissue into the cerebrospinal fluid spaces, driven by the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the edematous tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

There was early and full recovery of renal function in the single kidney, and the patient was completely rehabilitated. Review of the literature shows that an aggressive surgical approach to the management of renal artery occlusion is usually followed by excellent results. The pre-existence of renal artery stenosis encourages the formation of a collateral arterial supply which maintains the nutrition of the kidney almost indefinitely, after renal artery occlusion. Revascularization will result in prompt recovery of renal function.\r"

Two of the patients also had prior pelvic surgery, 1 of whom was azotemic, and 4 of the patients had psychosocial problems; factors reported to be associated with a false positive BST.

  ".W": "The clinical and electrophysiologic effects of oral amiodarone were evaluated in 10 patients with a history of spontaneous atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response, complicating the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Five patients developed ventricular fibrillation during an episode of atrial fibrillation. Seven patients underwent electrophysiology study and arrhythmia induction, both before and during chronic amiodarone treatment. During a mean 30 months of follow-up (range 8 to 59 months), no recurrences of atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation were noted. One patient had recurrent supraventricular tachycardia and underwent surgery. One had serious and five had minor side effects. Arrhythmia suppression was associated with prolongation of the anterograde accessory pathway (+38%, p less than 0.01) and atrial (+34%, p less than 0.01) effective refractory periods. Amiodarone also slowed the ventricular response to induced atrial fibrillation, prolonging the mean (+90%, p less than 0.01) and minimum (+104%, p = 0.01) R-R intervals. Thus, amiodarone is a safe and effective alternative for arrhythmia prevention if surgery is inadvisable or is not desired by the patient.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) for predicting ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction in patients presenting with sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) while on an empirically chosen antiarrhythmic agent was assessed in 17 patients. At the time of presentation with a malignant arrhythmia, 12 patients were taking quinidine, three patients were taking procainamide, and two patients were taking flecainide. All patients underwent programmed ventricular stimulation when not taking antiarrhythmic drugs; 12 patients had no inducible sustained VT and five patients had inducible sustained monomorphic VT. The SAECG done in the control state without antiarrhythmic agents was negative for late potentials in 11 of 12 patients in the noninducible group and positive for late potentials in four of five patients in the inducible group (sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 92%). We conclude that in patients presenting with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias while taking an antiarrhythmic drug, the SAECG distinguishes patients with possible proarrhythmic events from those who have the substrate for inducible sustained VT.\r"

  ".W": "Among 113 patients with transient, narrow-complex second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block detected by ambulatory ECG, there were 20 with non-Wenckebach behavior. Based on the presence or absence of PR interval shortening after single blocked complexes, patients with narrow-complex non-Wenckebach patterns could be separated into a pseudo-Mobitz II group of 16 patients (greater than or equal to 20 msec of PR shortening after the blocked complex) and a classic Mobitz II group of four patients (constant PR interval). These groups had additional distinct ECG and clinical features. Patients with the pseudo-Mobitz II pattern had a 44% prevalence of associated Wenckebach block during the same ambulatory recording, whereas Wenckebach behavior did not occur in patients with classic Mobitz II block. Pseudo-Mobitz II block occurred at significantly longer cycle lengths (876 vs 585 msec) and with significantly longer PR intervals (225 vs 165 msec) preceding the blocked complex than did classic Mobitz II block. Syncope was the presenting symptom in 38% of patients with pseudo-Mobitz II block and in all patients with classic Mobitz II block. Patients with pseudo-Mobitz II block had a 56% prevalence of associated coronary disease and a 44% prevalence of congestive heart failure; the mortality rate was 38% in this group over 4 years of follow-up, but in all instances death was due to associated disease rather than to conduction itself. In contrast, patients with classic Mobitz II block had hypertensive or valvular disease but no evidence of coronary disease or congestive failure; all are alive with pacemakers after 3 years of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen cases of ventricular parasystole were analyzed to determine whether the interectopic intervals were regular, as expressed by long intervals being exact multiples of the short ones, or not. The regularity of the interectopic intervals was assessed by means of the variation index: the ratio of the maximal difference between various measurements of the parasystolic cycle length and the mean parasystolic cycle length. Three out of 15 cases had a variation index less than 5, and were classified as \"regular parasystole.\" Twelve cases were associated with a variation index greater than 7.5, and were classified as \"irregular parasystole.\" The cases of irregular parasystole were then analyzed to determine whether the variability of the interectopic intervals was casual or dependent on action of the sinus beats. A parasystolic resetting by critically timed sinus impulses (a form of intermittent parasystole) was evident in three cases. The irregularity in the remaining nine cases was due to modulation (viz., due to electrotonic influence exerted by the sinus beats on the parasystolic focus). In every case of modulated parasystole a phase-response curve was constructed, which enabled an analysis of all the interectopic intervals on the basis of a time-dependent effect exerted by the sinus impulses on an otherwise rhythmic parasystolic focus.\r"

Seven patients had Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valves in the aortic position alone, seven in the mitral position, and six had prosthetic valves in both the aortic and mitral positions. In 10 patients with normally functioning mitral valves, the ratios of the maximal major and minor Doppler-imaged orifice flow diameters to the valve ring diameters were 25 +/- 3% (mean +/- SD) and 24 +/- 3%, respectively, similar to values reported in in vitro studies. No mitral regurgitation was found in these patients by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic flow mapping or by spectral Doppler. Of the 10 clinically normal aortic Bjork-Shiley valves, no valvular regurgitation was found by color flow mapping, whereas mild aortic regurgitation was found in two patients with the use of spectral Doppler. Malfunction of six valves was documented in five patients and was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and/or surgery. These included one case of focal fibrous ingrowth involving primarily the minor orifice of a mitral prosthetic valve, one case of mitral valve prosthetic thrombosis with decreased major and minor orifice flow diameters and valvular regurgitation, and four cases of paravalvular regurgitation involving prosthetic valves in the aortic position (three patients) and the mitral position (one patient). Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic flow mapping provides new observations that may aid in identifying Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valve malfunction. By localizing precisely the site of prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation, it may also assist in defining the cause of valve malfunction.\r"

Our patients had recurrent ischemia 10 +/- 7 days after infarction, with 75% experiencing rest angina and 15% having evidence of reinfarction. Angiography of the infarct-related artery demonstrated a critical stenosis in 35 of 54, a subtotal occlusion in 5 of 54, and a total occlusion in 14 of 54. PTCA was successful in 94% of critical stenoses, 80% of subtotal occlusions, but in only 50% of total occlusions. Complications related to PTCA included a 3.7% rate of emergency surgery, but no deaths or infarctions. During the clinical follow-up period of 11 +/- 7 months, there was one reinfarction and no deaths. Although 27% of our 44 patients with a successful initial PTCA required a second revascularization procedure for recurrent angina, 40 patients (91%) remained symptomatically improved with angioplasty alone (including successful repeat PTCA in eight patients). We conclude that PTCA of the infarct-related artery is beneficial for selected patients with recurrent ischemia in the zone of prior infarction.\r"

In addition, atheroma is not physically removed by PTCA, and restenosis of the treated vessel is common. We have tested a new, rotating, abrasive-tipped angioplasty device in vivo in 13 atherosclerotic rabbit iliac vessels. Atherosclerosis was generated in rabbit iliac vessels by a 2% cholesterol diet combined with balloon endothelial injury for 10 weeks. The diseased vessels were then treated with the rotational atherectomy device. Before treatment, contrast angiograms demonstrated that initial percent diameter stenosis was 81% +/- 9%. After atherectomy, there was significant improvement, with residual 38% +/- 22% narrowing (p less than 0.001). One perforation resulted from distal guidewire manipulation, and one vessel was occluded by the device. Histologic examination demonstrated loss of portions of the diseased intima in all cases. Particles were produced for analysis in vitro by operating the atherectomy device in atherosclerotic rabbit aortas perfused with saline solution. Ninety-eight percent of the particles produced by the device were less than 10 micron in diameter. We conclude that this new rotational device can remove atheromatous material from diseased arteries in rabbits. Such a device may complement other angioplasty techniques and lead to wider application of catheter-based therapeutic interventions.\r"

  ".W": "To assess relative capabilities of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) for evaluating regional contractile dysfunction in the left ventricle after a myocardial infarction, results from 22 concurrent MR (orthogonal-transaxial, ECG-gated, multiphasic, single-spin echo) and 2DE examinations were compared. By means of the same 11-segment LV description, MR and 2DE examinations were independently scored segment by segment for residual wall motion (point scores: 2 = normal, 1 = hypokinesia, 0 = akinesia, and -1 = dyskinesia). Significant correlation between MR and 2DE scoring was found throughout most of the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, but right coronary artery (RCA) distribution (i.e., middle-posterior segment not well seen) could not be fully evaluated by MR imaging. When cumulative scores for the 10 segments mutually evaluated were used to derive measures of global residual LV function (i.e., score quotient [SQ] = accumulated points divided by 20 total possible points), MR SQ correlated well overall with both 2DE SQ (r = 0.82; p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (EF) from ventriculography (r = 0.86, p less than 0.05 vs r = 0.88, p less than 0.05 for 2DE SQ compared with EF). MR evaluation of segmental wall motion was relatively stronger in the LAD distribution (MR SQ compared with 2DE SQ: r = 0.86, p less than 0.05; MR SQ compared with EF: r = 0.96, p less than 0.05) than in the RCA distribution (r = 0.06, p greater than or equal to 0.05 and r = 0.62, p greater than or equal to 0.05, respectively). For 2DE, regional variations were not as evident (2DE SQ compared with EF: r = 0.90, p less than 0.05 for LAD and r = 0.81, p less than 0.05 for RCA). For segmental evaluation of wall motion after myocardial infarction, MR imaging (transaxial, multiphasic) appears to be comparable to 2DE overall but superior in LAD distribution and inferior in RCA distribution.\r"

  ".W": "The determinants of reperfusion arrhythmias were investigated in 63 open-chest dogs undergoing a 25-minute coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Heart rate correlated positively with the occurrence of reperfusion ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Collateral flow during ischemia (radioactive microspheres) exhibited a strong negative correlation with the incidence of both VT and VF upon reperfusion. Importantly, a sensitive coupling was present, whereby small differences in flow were associated with large differences in rhythm disorders. The rise in intramyocardial CO2 tension (another index of severity of ischemia) was greater in dogs exhibiting reperfusion VT (p less than 0.001) and VF (p less than 0.08); however, this variable was significantly correlated with collateral flow (r = -0.57, p less than 0.01). The size of the occluded coronary bed, determined by postmortem perfusion, was not consistently related to VT; within a given range of occluded bed sizes, the incidence of VT was inversely related to collateral flow. Thus, reperfusion-induced VT is relatively independent of the size of the occluded bed, and is determined primarily by the degree of myocardial hypoperfusion. In contrast, VF did not develop with occluded beds less than 25% of the left ventricular mass; above this critical occluded bed size, its incidence was inversely related to collateral perfusion. Reperfusion VF is therefore determined by the association of a large occluded bed with a poor collateral flow. This study identifies and systematically analyzes three major determinants of reperfusion arrhythmias: (1) the severity of antecedent ischemia, estimated either from the degree of flow reduction or the rise in intramural CO2 tension; (2) the amount of ischemic/reperfused myocardium; and (3) the heart rate. In addition to conceptual interest and clinical implications, the findings have important implications for the design of future studies aimed at evaluating antiarrhythmic interventions in experimental models.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion of the coronary artery distal to an occlusion was performed in 16 canine preparations to compare the mechanical perfusion of autologous blood to the perfluorocarbon fluosol DA, 20% emulsion (FDA-20). Both substances were perfused under similar conditions (30, 60, and 80 ml/min) and regional electrograms, contractility, and coronary perfusion were measured relative to native coronary perfusion. Autologous blood (60 and 80 ml/min) produced a significant increase in regional (epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial) and transmural flow, but not in the endocardial/epicardial perfusion ratio. No other significant changes were observed during autologous blood perfusion. In contrast, FDA-20 perfusion resulted in significant ST depression (-1.8 +/- 0.2, -1.7 +/- 0.2, and -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm) at 30, 60, and 80 ml/min, respectively. FDA-20 also induced a significant decrease in distal diastolic coronary pressure and resistance, a significant decrease in the endocardial/epicardial perfusion ratio at all three perfusion rates, and a significant reduction in delivery of O2 to the subendocardium. These results indicate that autologous blood perfusion of the distal coronary artery during occlusion preserves myocardial function to a better degree than does FDA-20.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to treatment with intravenous metoprolol followed by oral metoprolol or placebo. All patients underwent hemodynamic monitoring for 24 hours. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenalin levels were estimated at baseline (mean 6.0 +/- 0.9 hours from onset of symptoms) and at 1 and 24 hours after the start of therapy. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenalin levels were elevated in all but one patient, with a further increase at 1 hour after administration of metoprolol (p less than 0.05). At baseline pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was directly related to both plasma adrenaline (r = -0.44; p less than 0.05) and noradrenalin levels (r = -0.44; p less than 0.05). There was also an inverse relationship between stroke volume index and the plasma noradrenalin level (r = -0.44; p less than 0.05) but not the plasma adrenaline level. These relationships were lost after the baseline measurements. However, between baseline and 1 hour there was a close relationship between the change in systemic vascular resistance and the changes in both adrenaline (r = -0.48; p less than 0.05) and noradrenalin levels (r = -0.66; p less than 0.01). Thus, in the early stages of myocardial infarction high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with the hemodynamic markers of severe left ventricular damage. Beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol produced a further increase in catecholamine levels that was associated with an increase in systemic vascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "A phenomenon entitled \"delayed myocardial ischemia\" has been described, in which there is a significant degree of coronary malperfusion following the cessation of behavioral stress. The primary objective of the present study was to develop a model for the delayed ischemic response in anesthetized animals to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. In 15 morphine and chloralose-anesthetized dogs, a moderate degree of stenosis was applied to the left circumflex coronary artery by means of a toroidal balloon occluder. The pulsed Doppler technique was used to monitor coronary flow. After baseline data were obtained, the left stellate ganglion was stimulated for 30 seconds. Heart rate increased (63%), as did systemic blood pressure (41%) and flow in the left circumflex artery (47%). These parameters rapidly returned to control levels when stimulation was terminated. Forty-five to 90 seconds later, coronary flow decreased by 65% and coronary vascular resistance increased by 45%. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by ECG abnormalities indicative of regional myocardial ischemia. The delayed ischemic response could be prevented by pretreatment with either nifedipine (20 micrograms/kg) or prazosin (0.3 mg/kg). These data indicate that the primary mechanism for the delayed ischemic response is alpha-adrenergically mediated contraction of the smooth muscle in the coronary artery wall.\r"

The provocative test was performed without previous coronary arteriography but only in patients with negative submaximal exercise test results. Rapid infusion of alkaline solution followed by maximal hyperventilation raised arterial pH above the 7.65 value necessary for diagnostic significance in 196 (83%) patients. In 24 (12%) of these patients the provocative test induced significant ischemic ST segment changes. In all patients with a positive response, coronary artery disease, which was predominantly vasospastic (19 patients) or atheromatous with a vasospastic contribution (five patients), was demonstrated by coronary arteriography followed, if necessary, by ergot derivative injection. Chest pain and ECG changes were always reversed within 5 minutes by intravenous nitroglycerin. Coronary arteriography was not performed in all patients with a negative response; therefore, the sensitivity of the procedure could not be assessed. However, 36 patients with a negative response to hyperventilation underwent coronary arteriography; 33 (92%) had normal arteriograms and a negative response to ergot derivatives. Hyperventilation appears to be a safe and specific diagnostic procedure in a subset of patients in whom the probability of coronary artery disease may not be judged sufficient to warrant coronary arteriography as a primary diagnostic approach.\r"

In the present study, the protective actions of acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with nadolol, 1.0 mg/kg administered intravenously immediately preceding the induction of posterolateral myocardial ischemia, were assessed in conscious dogs with recent, small anterior myocardial infarctions pretreated with digoxin, 0.0125 mg/kg/day intravenously, for 5 to 7 consecutive days (total n = 11). A cohort of postinfarction dogs pretreated with digoxin alone served as a control group (total n = 26). Pre vs postdigoxin electrophysiologic testing indicated reductions in myocardial refractoriness in ventricular noninfarct and infarct zones in both treatment groups, whereas the administration of nadolol tended to reverse the reductions in ventricular refractoriness. Arrhythmia-related deaths in response to posterolateral myocardial ischemia were reduced from 12 of 20 (60%) in the digoxin control group to 2 of 10 (20%) in the digoxin + nadolol group (p = 0.039). Serum digoxin concentrations (1.29 +/- 0.14 ng/ml vs 1.39 +/- 0.24 ng/ml), underlying anterior myocardial infarct size (6.9 +/- 1.5% vs 4.6 +/- 0.9% of left ventricle), and developing posterolateral myocardial infarct size (22.8 +/- 2.5% vs 17.5 +/- 3.6% of left ventricle) did not differ significantly between the digoxin and digoxin + nadolol groups. Acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with nadolol appears to reduce digitalis-mediated ischemic postinfarction mortality, possibly because of a salutary increase in ventricular refractoriness.\r"

A careful assessment of physical findings, ECG- and radionuclide-determined global and regional left ventricular function was performed in all patients to characterize the population with ischemic MR. Twenty-nine patients were found to have MR and in 65% the degree of MR was 2+ or more. All of the patients with significant MR had a systolic murmur on physical examination, and although this finding was 90% sensitive for MR it had a poor predictive value (42%). Even a characteristic apical holosystolic murmur, although specific for MR (90%), had a low sensitivity and predictive value. Two regional wall motion abnormalities (inferoposterior akinesis and apical dyskinesis with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) identified 26 of 29 patients with MR and all with 2+ or more MR, as well as the 10 patients who required mitral valve replacement in addition to coronary artery bypass grafting. This finding was complementary to the results of physical examination and when used together improved the diagnostic accuracy of identifying MR. The radionuclide regurgitant index was evaluated for its predictive value in assessing MR in this group of patients but was found to be a poor discriminator in patients with abnormal ejection fractions and regional wall motion abnormalities. The precatheterization assessment of left ventricular function with radionuclide angiography can provide important insight into the presence of ischemic MR.\r"

Clinical outcome of multivessel disease patients was compared to that of 189 patients with single-vessel disease who experienced successful PTCA. Eighty percent of multivessel disease patients noted clinical improvement at follow-up. More single-vessel disease patients, however, were free of angina (77% vs 63%, p = 0.02), were not taking long-acting antianginal medicationS (46% vs 27%, p less than 0.001), and had repeat PTCA less often (5% vs 12%, p = 0.05) than multivessel disease patients. The incidence of late clinical events such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, and death was low in both single- and multivessel disease patients. To determine whether the degree of revascularization achieved accounted for differences between single- and multivessel disease outcome, PTCA for multivessel disease was classified as either complete or incomplete revascularization. Those patients classified as having incomplete revascularization, although they had multivessel coronary artery disease, had only one significant ischemic zone and this was successfully revascularized by PTCA. There was no significant difference in anginal status or incidence of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, or death between the two multivessel disease subgroups. Thus, PTCA is of clinical value for selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, even in those who are incompletely revascularized by design.\r"

Side effects were minor and included bitter taste, dizziness, congestive heart failure, fatigue, and significant prolongation of the PR and QRS intervals.

All patients had been refractory to at least three prior antiarrhythmic agents (mean, 3.3 per patient), and 11 had multiple direct current cardioversions. Intravenous amiodarone suppressed sustained tachycardia in seven patients; the concurrent use of procainamide resulted in suppression in two additional patients. Ventricular tachycardia recurred in three patients, two within 2 hours of initiation of amiodarone. Adverse effects necessitated the discontinuation of amiodarone in one patient because of significant hemodynamic deterioration. The use of intravenous amiodarone was associated with a significant fall in heart rate and cardiac output. Plasma amiodarone levels were high after initial bolus loading but declined to low or less than therapeutic levels within 60 minutes. Thus although we found intravenous amiodarone to be effective in the short-term treatment of refractory ventricular tachycardia, administration of amiodarone can be associated with significant hemodynamic deterioration. The dosing protocol used should be modified to a lower initial bolus and a higher early maintenance infusion rate.\r"

These factors have been found to interact in a synergistic manner to increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Traditional antihypertensive treatment offers little protection against coronary heart disease, perhaps because antihypertensive drugs tend to be prescribed to reduce blood pressure without attention being paid to the presence of other risk factors. This symposium should clarify new knowledge on cardiovascular risk factors, thus influencing future therapeutic strategies for hypertension and cardiovascular disease in patients who smoke.\r"

Smoking increases blood pressure acutely, but smokers have generally had lower blood pressures than nonsmokers in epidemiologic studies. Smoking adversely affects the prognosis in patients who have suffered a MI and those with angina pectoris. Of great importance regarding community risk of smoking are the many light and moderate smokers. These persons should be addressed more vigorously in intervention efforts.\r"

Intravenous nicotine and smoking raise plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels through enhanced lipolysis resulting from sympathoadrenal stimulation. The study reported here investigated FFA-stimulated myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) in intact dogs. It was found that about half of the nicotine-induced rise in MVO2 resulted from metabolic stimulation by high concentrations of FFA, and the remainder was a result of enhanced mechanical activity of the heart directly produced by nicotine. In intact dogs, the increase in myocardial oxygen requirement resulting from excess myocardial FFA uptake also increased the severity of myocardial ischemic injury after acute coronary occlusion. Human studies with men who had smoked for more than 10 years showed that smokers had lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions 2 and 3. High-density lipoprotein fraction 2 is reported to be antiatherogenic. Thus smoking appears to have at least two lipid effects that may promote coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis: increased plasma FFA and decreased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction 2.\r"

The MRC trial had two active treatment groups, one of which received bendrofluazide and the other propranolol. The main positive result of the trial was a 45% reduction in stroke events in the actively treated groups. Propranolol appeared to be much less effective than bendrofluazide in the prevention of stroke in smokers, although both active drugs were equally effective in nonsmokers. Possible explanations for this lack of efficacy in smokers are discussed. Coronary events were not reduced by treatment, although there was a trend toward their reduction in nonsmoking men treated with propranolol. The lack of effect of propranolol in reducing coronary morbidity and mortality rates was a surprise in view of the positive results from trials with both short-term and long-term treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade after myocardial infarction.\r"

At the time of entry, 37% of the men and 23% of the women were smoking cigarettes, and only 537 patients changed their smoking status during the trial. In men and women, smoking doubled cardiac and cerebrovascular event rates. Nonsmoking men had fewer myocardial infarctions and sudden deaths when treated with oxprenolol. Smoking status did not affect in-study blood pressure control, the type of drugs, or the combinations used, but smokers were given higher doses of oxprenolol. For a given blood pressure during antihypertensive treatment, rates for cardiac and cerebrovascular events were higher in smokers. Heart rates were higher in both oxprenolol and non-beta-blocker-treated smokers. Smoking dose dependently increased hematocrit level. Among physician-elicited symptoms, dyspnea and cold extremities were more frequent in smokers, whereas dyspnea, headaches, impotence, dizziness, and anxiety states were common, with unsatisfactory blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg). Quality of life may be more jeopardized by smoking, poor blood pressure control, or diuretic use than by beta-blocker-based therapy. In the IPPPSH, the patient who smoked had double the cardiovascular complication rates without cardiac benefit from the beta-blocker despite higher doses given; the higher heart rate and hematocrit level may have been contributing factors.\r"

In addition to encouraging these patients to stop smoking, effective nondrug therapies include weight reduction, salt restriction, and alcohol limitation. For patients whose hypertension is severe or who have other health problems, antihypertensive drug therapy is also used. In the past, diuretics and beta-blockers have proved popular. However, these drugs have produced biochemical disturbances, such as diuretic-induced hypokalemia and both diuretic- and beta-blocker-induced alterations in blood lipids. The hazard of such drug-induced alterations may be greater in hypertensive patients, who may already suffer from hypercholesterolemia. Other drugs are available that can treat hypertension with no or beneficial influence on blood lipids. For smokers, the selective alpha 1-receptor inhibitors may be more attractive, since they also act to counteract the vasoconstriction produced by nicotine. In the future, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase may offer potential for effective control of blood lipids in hypertensive patients who smoke.\r"

Compared with patients allocated to conventional therapy, patients allocated to intracoronary thrombolysis had smaller enzymatic infarct size by 29% (p less than 0.001), smaller LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes by 10% (p less than 0.05) and 20% (p less than 0.005), respectively, and higher LV ejection fraction (55 +/- 1% vs 49 +/- 1%; p less than 0.001). The beneficial effects of thrombolytic therapy on LV performance were closely associated with thrombolysis-induced limitation of infarct size. The dependence from infarct size of LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction was not different in the 2 therapy groups. It was concluded that Witteveen's method of infarct size assessment is not influenced by the presence of reperfusion. Therefore, this method was recommended for trials on recanalization in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "While epicardially implanted electrodes remain the most widely used in children for ventricular pacing, their expected longevity remains unknown. The longevity of 126 such electrodes implanted from January 1970 through December 1985 was evaluated in 81 children followed up for 1 to 192 months (median 63). Age at initial implant was 1 day to 18 years. Each child had from 1 to 5 electrodes implanted; 85 electrodes were of the sutureless helical type and 41 were of the suture-fixated type. Electrode failure, defined as loss of capture with a high pacing threshold found at operation or sensing failure, occurred in 38 electrodes from 1 to 157 months postimplant (median 37). Mode of failure was high threshold with high impedance (n = 15), low impedance (n = 6), complete inability to pace (n = 8), sensing failure (n = 2) or high threshold with no measure of impedance (n = 7). Actuarial life table analysis of electrode longevity showed a 88 +/- 3% (standard error of the estimate) survival rate at 6 months with no significant decrease until 53 months (75 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05). There was then a gradual steady decrease to 49 +/- 7% by 101 months. From 101 to 157 months no significant decrease occurred. Survival rate decrease was greatest within the first 6 month period postimplant (-12%). Electrodes surviving to 6 months are highly likely to survive until 53 months. Of those surviving to 53 months, 74% should survive to 120 months.\r"

Twenty pacemakers were implanted after catheter ablation of the His bundle, 7 for sick sinus syndrome. 1 for atrioventricular block and 3 for sick sinus syndrome with atrioventricular block. A rate response value was selected that gave a pacing rate of about 100 pulses/min during walking. Of the 31 patients, all had 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring with diary, 11 walked a 20-minute circuit, including a flight of stairs, and 20 had a treadmill exercise test. In 9 patients the pacing rate could be compared with the underlying sinus rate during exercise and was seen to match it very closely. In 12 patients the pacing rate during car driving was found to be similar to the sinus rate of 5 volunteers under similar conditions (mean minimum and maximum rate was 80 and 99 pulses/min, respectively). No pacing-induced arrhythmias were seen during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. At high pacing rates slightly irregular pacing intervals were sometimes observed, which was due to polarization sensing. Sporadically, 1 pacing interval shortened to the upper rate value, because of a known and now resolved timing anomaly. Neither anomaly was of clinical consequence and the first could be resolved by reprogramming.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pacemakers were implanted in 145 (77%) patients with tachybrady syndrome, 35 (19%) with sinus bradycardia and 7 (4%) with ventricular arrhythmia. Intact atrioventricular (AV) conduction was defined as absence of second- or third-degree heart block with incremental atrial pacing to a heart rate of 120 beats/min before implantation. The average follow-up was 30 months, including 87 patients (46%) who were followed an average of 48 months. Four patients developed significant conduction disease requiring placement of a ventricular lead. Complications included 4 lead fractures (all coronary sinus leads), 10 dislodgments (9 coronary sinus, 1 tined atrial \"J\") and 6 threshold rises requiring repositioning of the lead. Eight dislodgments occurred within an average of 5.6 days. The average increase in threshold that required repositioning occurred at 14 days. The average lead fracture occurred at 25 months. Atrial pacing is safe and effective for patients with sinoatrial node disorder (sick sinus syndrome) and intact AV conduction. Progression to clinically significant AV block is uncommon. Complications occur early with coronary sinus leads and are less common with newer leads.\r"

Both groups of patients in phase 2 had similar Doppler gradients and clinical and auscultatory evidence of moderate to severe AS at baseline.

Nevertheless, the echocardiogram is generally used as an independent standard for the diagnosis of MVP despite lack of consensus on the criteria to be used and the probability of interobserver variability. Conversely, there is a relatively uniform consensus that classic auscultatory signs establish the diagnosis of MVP beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, in 148 patients referred for evaluation of known or suspected MVP, the echocardiographic patterns that coincide with diagnostic auscultatory signs were studied prospectively to compare those patterns with criteria commonly used for the echocardiographic diagnosis of MVP and to determine interobserver variability in echocardiographic interpretation. Eighty patients (54%) had a classic mid- to late systolic click or an apical late systolic murmur, or both. Eleven patients (7%) had the apical holosystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation with no discernible clinical or echocardiographic cause other than the consideration of MVP. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 80 of the 148 patients. The degree of superior systolic bowing of each mitral leaflet and the location of leaflet coaptation relative to the presumed plane of the mitral anulus were graded on apical 4-chamber and parasternal long-axis views. The only patterns absolutely specific for auscultatory MVP were: severe bowing of the anterior or posterior leaflet; coaptation of leaflets on the left atrial side of the anular plane; moderate to severe Doppler mitral regurgitation accompanied by any degree of leaflet bowing; and mild Doppler mitral regurgitation accompanied by moderate bowing of a leaflet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-one (40%) patients had large V waves (V wave greater than A wave by greater than 10 mm Hg, group 1), and 31 (60%) patients had small V waves (group 2).

Associated clinical features were: aortic stenosis in 28%, history of systemic hypertension in 10%, history of rheumatic fever in 4% and none of these features in 58% of patients.

In 37 (66%) of 56 patients who had simultaneous echocardiograms and phonocardiograms recorded, the aortic ejection sound occurred at 0.01 second before or after the maximal opening point of the aortic valve leaflets. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients and a bicuspid aortic valve was identified in 38 patients (22%). In 83 patients (49%) 3 cusps were clearly seen. In 49 patients (29%) an accurate determination was not possible. Anatomic examination of 120 consecutive aortic valves at autopsy was performed to identify possible causes of the aortic ejection sound. In 18 (15%) of autopsies fusion of 2 aortic cusps extending greater than or equal to 5 mm from the attachment to the aorta was observed. This abnormality, aortic commissural fusion, may be congenital or acquired. It is concluded that aortic ejection sounds may occur in patients without bicuspid aortic valves and in a variety of clinical conditions. A moderate degree of cuspal fusion may be the cause of the sound.\r"

Twenty-eight patients (38%) died, 14 patients (19%) due to pump failure and 14 patients (19%) due to sudden death. Univariate analysis revealed ventricular tachycardias as a major risk indicator, among others. However, multivariate analysis determined the major independent risk factors in the following order: patients who died from pump failure, left ventricular filling pressure, left bundle branch block, the number of beats in the longest episode of ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular ejection fraction; patients who died from sudden death, left bundle branch block and left ventricular ejection fraction, but not any form of ventricular arrhythmias. Reclassification by means of the risk factors resulted in a meaningful identification of patients who died from pump failure; however, patients who died from sudden death could not be separated from survivors. Thus, in the present study Holter monitoring was unable to distinguish between patients who died from subsequent pump failure and patients who died from subsequent sudden death.\r"

Patients were included if chest pain lasted for greater than 30 minutes, was unresponsive to sublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with at least 0.2 mV ST-segment elevation in at least 2 contiguous electrocardiographic leads. All patients received 1.5 million IU of streptokinase intravenously, a mean of 195 +/- 99 minutes after onset of chest pain. Tc-99m-PPi scans and coronary cineangiograms were recorded 491 +/- 156 minutes and 518 +/- 202 minutes, respectively, after the onset of symptoms. Effective reperfusion was present in 10 patients, 6 of whom had positive Tc-99m-PPi scans (sensitivity of 60% to detect reperfusion). Of the 6 patients without effective reperfusion, 3 had positive Tc-99m-PPi scans (specificity of 50%, p greater than 0.05). Analysis of the data using various definitions of effective reperfusion or artery patency yielded similar results. Thus, our findings indicate that early AMI scanning with Tc-99m-PPi does not accurately detect the presence or absence of reperfusion in patients with AMI after treatment with intravenous streptokinase. At this time, coronary cineangiography is the only reliable method to detect reperfusion promptly after thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Volumes were calculated using Simpson's rule from casts ranging from 2 to 42 ml from 25 postmortem specimens with various congenital heart diseases. The casts were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 15) with abnormal or group 2 (n = 10) with normal RV hemodynamic measurements. Biplane cinegrams were taken in the anterolateral, anterior and long axis oblique, hepatoclavicular and sitting up projections. The true volume of each cast was determined from its weight and specific gravity. Excellent correlations were obtained between measured and true volumes (r = 0.92 to 0.96) in all projections, although each projection overestimated the true volume (slope value less than 1). The regression equations obtained from group 1 were not statistically different from those in group 2 in any view. Although the application of different regression equations is required in measuring RV volumes by multiple angulated angiography, these regression equations appear not to be affected by the hemodynamic state of the ventricle. These results are important in assessing RV volume in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease using axial angulated ventriculography.\r"

Operative mortality rates were not statistically different in the years compared. Also, the operative mortality rates in 1985 for patients with and without preoperative catheterization were not statistically different. In 1975, cardiac catheterization changed the primary clinical diagnosis in 21%. In 1985, the primary diagnosis was not changed by catheterization; however, 2-D and Doppler echocardiography changed the diagnosis in 18%. The change in utilization of cardiac catheterization appears to be most closely related to the maximal utilization of a substitute imaging and hemodynamic modality--namely, 2-D and Doppler echocardiography.\r"

Forty-five patients were randomly assigned either to a high- (65 to 75% maximum oxygen consumption rate [VO2max]) or to a low-intensity (less than 45% VO2max) exercise group. Patients engaged in medically supervised aerobic training 3 sessions a week for 12 weeks. With training, mean VO2max significantly increased by 11% (2.09 to 2.31 liters/min) within the high group and by 14% (1.93 to 2.21 liters/min) within the low group. Differences between groups were not statistically significant. Both groups also had comparable changes in heart rate, blood pressure and double-product at submaximal and maximal workloads. Analysis of blood lipids revealed that both groups experienced a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. There were no significant changes in total serum cholesterol or triglycerides. These findings suggest that within an unselected population of patients after acute myocardial infarction referred for cardiac rehabilitation, low- and high-intensity exercise training produces relatively similar changes in cardiorespiratory variables during the initial 3 months of exercise training.\r"

Patients were stratified according to the type of electrocardiographic alteration at rest: 295 had ST-segment elevation (group 1), 106 T-wave changes (group 2) and 251 ST-segment depression (group 3). Patients in group 3, compared with groups 1 and 2, were more likely to have symptoms of coronary artery disease dating back many years (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively), a previous myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05 and difference not significant), a positive exercise test (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01), transient ST-T changes occurring in a higher number of electrocardiographic leads (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01), multivessel disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01) and poor ventricular function (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05). Despite these differences, the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and cardiac death during hospitalization was much more frequent in group 1 compared with groups 2 (p less than 0.02) and 3 (p less than 0.05). However, death occurred in those patients who had poor ventricular function and severe atherosclerosis. A greater susceptibility of group 1 patients to severe vasoconstriction documented by the ergonovine test and by the occurrence of spontaneous spasm seems to account for different in-hospital outcome.\r"

Many studies have reported good reproducibility when it is performed in the morning, but little information is available regarding the diurnal variation of exercise test response in patients with chronic stable angina. With the advent of new long-acting anti-ischemic drugs, it has become necessary to perform the exercise testing at various times of the day to determine the duration of action of a given drug. To examine the diurnal variation, exercise tests were performed on 41 patients, aged 53 to 75 years, with established chronic stable angina on 2 occasions 5 days apart at 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. on each day. On day 1, the mean +/- standard error of the mean exercise time was 5.0 +/- 0.4 minutes at 10 A.M. and 5.1 +/- 0.4 minutes at 4 P.M., and on day 5, it was 5.6 +/- 0.4 minutes at 10 A.M. and 5.5 +/- 0.4 minutes at 4 P.M. These values did not differ in statistical significance. Similarly, the time to the development of 1 mm of ST-segment depression did not show any statistically significant change during either test period on either day nor did maximal ST-segment depression. Heart rate at rest was 79 +/- 3 beats/min at 10 A.M., 81 +/- 3 beats/min at 4 P.M. on day 1 and 78 +/- 2 beats/min at 10 A.M. and 80 +/- 3 beats/min at 4 P.M. on day 5 (difference not significant).

Chest pain may occur with dipyridamole-thallium testing, but its diagnostic significance is uncertain. Forty-five patients who had coronary angiography, no revascularization and chest pain during dipyridamole-thallium testing were identified. These patients were matched blindly by sex and age to 45 patients who had coronary angiography, no revascularization and no chest pain reported during the dipyridamole-thallium test. In the groups with versus without chest pain, 9 versus 24% had no CAD, 16 versus 16% had 1-vessel disease, 38 versus 29% had 2-vessel CAD and 38 versus 29% had 3-vessel CAD. These differences did not achieve statistical significance. Also, there were no evident differences in the severity of angiographic CAD by vessel or by percent of stenosis (p greater than 0.50). There was only a moderate association with ischemic ST changes (40 versus 16%, p less than 0.02). Chest pain with concurrent ischemic ST changes also failed to predict any difference in distribution or severity of angiographic stenoses. We conclude that chest pain during dipyridamole-thallium testing is not closely related to the severity of CAD and has little diagnostic value.\r"

Of the 31 patients with abnormal radionuclide angiographic findings, 13 had restenosis. When the exercise radionuclide angiogram was used to stratify patients according to risk of restenosis, the negative predictive value of a normal test was 100% (95% confidence limits = 81 to 100%) and the positive predictive value was 42%. By this method, 35% of the entire study population could be classified as low risk for restenosis after PTCA. Early exercise radionuclide angiography identifies subgroups of patients who are at low and high risk for early restenosis after PTCA.\r"

The coronary flow reserves of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries to establish whether PTCA can restore to normal the coronary flow reserve of patients with chronic coronary artery disease. The quantitative cineangiographic changes and the concomitant alterations in coronary flow reserve as an immediate result of the PTCA and the subsequent changes 5 months later are described. Coronary flow reserve was measured with digital subtraction cineangiography. PTCA resulted in an increase in minimal obstruction area (mean +/- standard deviation) from 0.8 +/- 0.3 to 3.4 +/- 0.7 mm2 and in coronary flow reserve from 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.5 +/- 0.6. Five months later a further substantial and significant (p less than 0.05) late increase in obstruction area (3.8 +/- 0.9 mm2) and flow reserve (3.6 +/- 0.5) had occurred. In 11 of 15 patients coronary flow reserve was restored to normal. Changes in stenosis geometry are likely to be 1 of the major determinants of this late normalization of coronary flow reserve.\r"

The mean arterial blood pressure at rest was reduced by 5% and the left ventricular ejection fraction at rest decreased 2% because of end-systolic dilation during intoxication (serum ethanol 21 mmol/liter). No changes were observed in heart rate, stroke volume, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure or total peripheral resistance. No significant changes occurred in plasma catecholamines, and no changes occurred in any variable during mild exercise corresponding to a 30 to 40% heart rate increase. Thus, alcohol ingested in moderate doses causes slight impairment of left ventricular emptying and a reduction in the arterial blood pressure at rest in patients with coronary artery disease. A mild exercise load can be tolerated during alcohol intoxication without hemodynamic changes.\r"

Systemic and coronary hemodynamic and metabolic measurements were made before and during DCA administration (mean dose 35 mg/kg, intravenously).

Angina associated with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram was induced in 5 patients (26%) in the control condition, in 14 (74%) after phentolamine and in 5 of 16 (31%) after atropine. All anginal events but 1 occurred after the cessation of the exercise and were not associated with the significant increase of rate-pressure products. These attacks were considered to be due to coronary spasm. The frequency of the induction of angina was significantly higher after phentolamine than in the other 2 conditions (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that the attack can be induced by the handgrip exercise in a sizable number of patients with variant angina, and that the administration of phentolamine increases the incidence of angina induced by handgrip exercise. The mechanism or mechanisms by which coronary spasm is induced by handgrip exercise remains to be elucidated.\r"

Temporary pacing was performed at a demand heart rate of 40 beats/min while bradyarrhythmia developed. Coronary arteriography after administration of acetylcholine showed coronary vasoconstriction in all 10 patients (100%) of group A.

During a 48-month follow-up, 144 patients (17%) died. The deaths were examined for the chronology, cause, mechanism, location and presence of myocardial ischemia in the terminal event. A classification previously proposed by Hinkle and Thaler was used to define the mechanism of cardiac death and the presence of ischemia. There were 113 deaths due to coronary atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, including 5 due to complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Of the remaining 108 of these deaths, 74% were classified as due to an arrhythmic mechanism and 26% as myocardial failure. Of the deaths due to an arrhythmia or to myocardial failure, 56 (52%) occurred out of hospital. The ratio of arrhythmic: myocardial failure deaths was not different for the patients who died within 3 months after the index AMI compared with later deaths. Sudden death (less than or equal to 1 hour of new symptoms) was strongly associated with arrhythmic death but 32 (54%) of patients who died greater than 1 hour after the onset of symptoms were also classified as having an arrhythmic cause of death. Previously described risk factors, including an ejection fraction less than 0.40 and greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature complexes/hour, were independent predictors of mortality but did not differentially predict the mechanism of cardiac death. Evidence of myocardial ischemia before the terminal event was found in about 50 (60%) patients whose deaths were witnessed and who died from an arrhythmia or myocardial failure.\r"

QT estimates varied between leads. The variation was greater in patients with myocardial infarction than in control subjects (mean dispersion of QT: control subjects, 48 +/- 18 ms [+/- standard deviation]; anterior myocardial infarction, 70 +/- 30 ms; inferior myocardial infarction, 73 +/-32 ms). The maximum QT in any lead (QTmax) was determined and the deviation of each lead from this maximum value calculated. In all 3 groups, anteroseptal leads (V2 or V3) provided the closest approximation to QTmax. Interlead variability was found to be mainly due to variation in timing of the end of the T wave, rather than the onset of the QRS complex. The variability due to leads was considerably greater than the variability due to cycles, observers or measurement error. Implementation of a variety of current lead selection practices resulted in widely divergent estimates of QT interval. It is concluded that there is a need for standardization of lead selection practice for QT measurement. If measurements are confined to one or a few leads, anteroseptal leads provide the closest approximation to QTmax.\r"

To evaluate systematically the relative influence of local latency and large-scale conduction delay in limiting the delivery of closely coupled impulses, the strength-interval relation of the effective refractory period (RP), and the local and remote functional RP in 35 patients at paced cycle length of 500 ms were measured. The pacing threshold was less than or equal to 0.25 mA in all patients. The drive-train (S1) and the extrastimulus (S2) were applied from the same site, the right ventricular (RV) apex, in 25 patients, and from separate sites (RV apex and RV outflow tract) in 10 patients. The effect of procainamide (plasma concentration 10.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml) on the strength-interval relations in 10 patients was also assessed. Although effective RP decreased significantly with each successive increase in current strength (p less than 0.001), local functional RP decreased only up to current strength of 4 mA, and remote functional RP decreased only up to 2 mA. Procainamide shifted the effective RP and local and remote functional RP strength-interval curves uniformly to the right without altering their relation. These data indicate that large-scale conduction delay provides the principal limitation for using increasing current strengths of a single extrastimulus to initiate or terminate ventricular tachycardia.\r"

In this study, 30 patients received procainamide in this fashion; the right ventricular effective refractory period and the QRS duration at a ventricular pacing rate of 120/minute were then determined every minute for 20 minutes. Ten patients received no maintenance infusion of procainamide (group A), 10 received a 4 mg/min maintenance infusion (group B) and 10 received an 8 mg/min maintenance infusion (group C). Ten additional patients received no procainamide and served as control subjects (group D). The plasma procainamide concentration was measured at 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after the loading dose was administered. A stable plasma procainamide concentration was not present in group A, B, or C until 15 minutes after infusion of the loading dose. The effective refractory period and QRS duration increased compared with baseline at 1 minute, decreased between 1 and 10 minutes and then remained essentially unchanged between 10 and 20 minutes in all 3 treatment groups. Concentration-effect relation was linear in each treatment group. The plasma procainamide concentrations in group C were significantly greater than in group A; however, the effects on refractoriness and QRS duration were similar in both groups. These findings indicate that with a procainamide dosing method commonly used during electropharmacologic testing, the plasma procainamide concentration decreases significantly during the first 15 minutes after the loading dose is administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data from 42 healthy volunteers were compared with those from 52 patients with previous AMI (24 anterior) but no VT and 46 post-AMI patients (33 anterior AMI) with recurrent sustained VT. Patients with VT differed from other post-AMI patients because of lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more frequent aneurysm formation and higher levels of ventricular ectopic activity. A significant decrease in initial voltage amplitude occurred at 30 to 40 ms after the beginning of the QRS in both anterior and inferior AMI patients compared with the normal group. A further significant decrease in initial amplitude occurred in VT patients both after anterior and inferior AMI. These differences persisted for the remainder of the 80-ms interval. These changes were weakly related to QRS duration (r = 0.45), ejection fraction (r = 0.50) and poorly correlated with the presence of Q waves on 12-lead electrocardiogram (r = 0.21). Direct endocardial catheter recordings performed in VT patients confirmed abnormalities of local septal activation after anterior and inferior AMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of serum albumin to a maize gruel had no significant effect on nonheme Fe absorption whereas the addition of beef meat caused a threefold increase. When added to a bread meal, serum albumin caused a modest 60% increase in nonheme Fe absorption and beef meat had no effect. When added to a protein-free meal, serum albumin reduced Fe absorption by 47% compared with a 72% reduction on addition of egg white. The bioavailability of nonheme Fe from meals containing serum albumin was consistently overestimated by the in vitro technique. We conclude that the facilitation of nonheme Fe absorption by meat is not a general property of all animal protein but is better explained by the action of one or more specific animal tissues.\r"

These infants received Fe mainly from fortification Fe with beikost (75-86%) and less than 10% met the recommended intake of 1 mg.kg-1.d-1; whereas 80-85% of the infants fed the Fe-fortified formula did. Hb, Hct, FEP, and ferritin were similar in both groups with the exception of lower ferritin values at age 365 d (p less than 0.05) in the group fed the nonfortified formula. No infant had hemoglobin less than 100 g/L. We conclude that regular consumption of commercially prepared Fe-fortified beikost with meat prevents most healthy term infants from Fe deficiency even if Fe intake is substantially below the recommended intake.\r"

Na excretion was decreased during the study period in both males (112.9 +/- 6.3 vs 53.4 +/- 3.6 mmol, p less than 0.001) and females (91.1 +/- 3.2 vs 41.1 +/- 1.9 mmol, p less than 0.001). Changes in systolic blood pressure were not significant in either sex but females showed a decrease (p less than 0.05) in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. Because blood pressure in children is correlated with age and body size, multiple linear regression was used to adjust blood pressure levels for age and weight. These analyses yielded small but significant decreases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure measurements. The blood pressure response was heterogeneous but this variable response could not be attributed to varying degrees of compliance within families. These results suggest that compliance with modest Na restriction does not consistently lower blood pressure in normotensive children.\r"

Compositional and chromatographic analysis of HDL fraction showed that Zn deficiency significantly lowered the total amount of circulating HDL particles with no effect on the concentrations of total protein, triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol. The ratios of free: esterified cholesterol remained the same for the three groups. Electrophoretic analysis of the apolipoprotein profile showed marked decreases in the relative contents of apolipoproteins E and C and an increase in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I with no significant change in apo A-VI. No apparent morphologic aberrations of HDL particles were observed. Such changes may significantly influence the transport and metabolism of cholesterol and may provide an explanation for altered cholesterol homeostasis in Zn deficiency.\r"

LRTI reduced weight gain in young children by 14.7 g/d of infection and diarrheal diseases in weaning infants by 14.4 g/d.

Energy derived from alcohol tended to replace energy derived from other nutrients and increasing intake of alcohol was associated with a decrease in the amounts of carbohydrate, total fat, and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Those with a low alcohol intake (0.1-9 g alcohol/d) had a higher intake of total fiber, cereal fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid and a smaller proportion smoked cigarettes. The differences are small but may contribute to the lower mortality from CHD reported by other studies in those with a low alcohol intake.\r"

To address these issues, oxygen uptake (VO2) was determined at rest and during incremental cycle ergometry in 13 moderately obese (133 +/- 3% ideal body weight, means +/- SEM) women during weight maintenance and after 3 wk of caloric restriction (800 kcal/d). Work efficiency was calculated from the linear portion of the VO2-work rate relationship. Caloric restriction decreased body weight 4.0 +/- 0.4 kg (p less than 0.05), VO2 at rest 32 +/- 3 mL/min (p less than 0.05), and VO2 during unloaded (0 W) cycling 47 +/- 14 mL/min (p less than 0.05). However, work efficiency was unchanged (ie, -0.3 +/- 1.2%, NS). We conclude that, despite metabolic adaptations resulting in decreased energy expenditure at rest and during zero Watt cycling, acute caloric restriction does not alter work efficiency.\r"

A 2-by-4 ANOVA (sex by speed) revealed significant differences in the energy output between the speed conditions. There was no significant difference between the sexes. A nonlinear increase in calorie output with increasing speed indicated a decreasing efficiency with increasing speed of walking. Possible reasons include biomechanical factors such as increased upper-body forward lean needed to maintain balance at faster speeds of movement, increased energy output due to increased inertia, extra energy output needed to accelerate the limbs and torso, and increased body fat.\r"

Fecal steroid excretion, determined from 5-d collections, was not affected by psyllium supplementation. Although psyllium tended to delay lipid absorption, plasma triglycerides, retinyl esters, glucose, insulin, and glucagon quantitated during meal tolerance tests given on the last day of each diet period were not different (p greater than 0.05).

Equations for predicting LBMd from resistance measured by BIA, height, weight, and age were obtained for the men and women. Application of each equation to the data from the other labs yielded small reductions in R values and small increases in SEEs. Some regression coefficients differed among labs but these differences were eliminated after adjustment for differences among labs in the subjects' body fatness. All data were pooled to derive fatness-specific equations for predicting LBMd: the resulting R values ranged from 0.907 to 0.952 with SEEs of 1.97-3.03 kg. These results confirm the validity of BIA and indicate that the precision of predicting LBM from impedance can be enhanced by sex- and fatness-specific equations.\r"

In both rat groups transport of PteGlu was linear for approximately 40 s of incubation and was similar in the presence of a Na+ and a K+ gradient (out greater than in). In resected rats transport of PteGlu was inhibited by the structural analogues 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3H4PteGlu) and methotrexate (MTX), by sulfasalazine, and by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and was saturable as a function of concentration (apparent Kt = 18.3 microM). In the ileum of sham-operated rats, on the other hand, transport of PteGlu was not affected by 5-CH3H4PteGlu, MTX, sulfasalazine, or DIDS and was linear with concentration. These results suggest that the PteGlu transport system is induced in remnant ileum of the rat after extensive intestinal resection.\r"

Serum data showed PteGlu absorption was more rapid than PteGlu7 absorption. Urinary excretion of PteGlu7 was 63% (50 less than or equal to mean less than or equal to 76%) of PteGlu excretion. Addition of 30 g wheat bran to the formula meal accelerated PteGlu absorption whereas PteGlu7 absorption was not significantly affected by either food. Effects of the two foods were qualitatively different. Wheat bran increased the absorption of PteGlu relative to PteGlu7 whereas beans minimized the difference between PteGlu and PteGlu7 serum areas.\r"

Our study tested the hypothesis that elevated UMMA in breast-fed infants is associated with decreased maternal serum B-12 concentrations. UMMA concentrations were measured in 17 vegetarian mothers and their infants and in six infants of nonvegetarian mothers. Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations were determined in all mothers. Range of UMMA for vegetarian infants (3-924 mcg/mg [2.6-790.9 mumol/mmol] creatinine) was much broader than that for omnivorous infants (2-25 mcg/mg [1.7-21.4 mumol/mmol] creatinine). Maternal UMMA and serum vitamin B-12 were negatively correlated (r = -0.700, p = 0.003). Infant UMMA concentrations correlated positively with maternal UMMA concentrations (r = 0.686, p = 0.003) and inversely with maternal serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (r = -0.681, p less than 0.001). In three infants with high UMMA concentrations, vitamin B-12 treatment (oral B-12, vitamin B-12 injection, or a modification of maternal diet within the vegetarian philosophy) led to an abrupt decrease of UMMA.\r"

The computer model delineates all combinations of CV and bias compatible with specified medical usefulness limits. Both CV and bias are critical in determining a laboratory's ability to meet medical usefulness limits. For example, a laboratory with a 6% CV and zero bias will meet the +/- 10% or less total analytic error (medical usefulness limit) 90% of the time. If the medical usefulness limit is expanded to +/- 15%, a laboratory with a 6% CV can tolerate coexisting relative biases of up to 4% and still meet this limit 95% of the time. Plots of the limiting values for combinations of intralaboratory CV and bias are given that allow the laboratory's results to fall within medical usefulness limits of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20%.\r"

Lectin binding patterns of seminal vesicle and central zone of the prostate were identical except for a single lectin, supporting the concept that these two structures have a common embryologic origin from the wolffian duct. Three of the lectins that bound to central zone were not bound in peripheral zone, indicating a biologic difference between these two regions of the prostate. Dysplasia foci showed markedly reduced binding with all lectins, consistent with impaired processing of glyco-conjugates. Lectin binding patterns appear to have value as sensitive markers of differences in terminal differentiation of closely related tissues and of early impairment of differentiated function in lesions that are precursors to carcinoma. Specific patterns of lectin binding provide information on the differential carbohydrate composition of the regions of the prostate.\r"

The presence of SMF was suspected in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections in 48 of the 297 cases and was confirmed by reticulin stains in 26 (8.8%) cases, with seven of these also showing collagen on trichrome stain. However, the literature on MM documents little recognition of this association. SMF is often responsible for inadequate marrow aspirates yielding spurious or inconclusive results. Thus, bone marrow trephine biopsies may be required to histologically confirm the diagnosis of MM when there is concurrent SMF.\r"

Thromboquik is a thrombin reagent that is convenient in its day-to-day use and that exhibits prolonged stability after reconstitution. As an extension of an evaluation of this commercial thrombin reagent, the authors have made several observations about the TCT itself. In a comparison between multiple pairs of TCT reagents, the relative extent of departure of clotting times from normal, for any given abnormal plasma sample, was not predictably related to the mean normal clotting times of the two reagents. The authors also concluded that centrifugation of blood at 1,500 X g is inadequate to prepare plasma for the TCT.\r"

The values for pepsinogen I, basal or post-stimulation, were higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with cirrhosis who had not undergone surgical shunt than in those in the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences when these two groups were compared with the patients who had been subjected to portacaval shunt. In this last group of patients, seven had levels similar to those of the controls, and six presented higher values. Likewise, the values for gastric acid secretion were similar in the three groups of patients, and the basal gastrin level was lower (p less than 0.001) among patients with liver cirrhosis, whether or not they had undergone surgery, than among the control population.

Five complex patients with acute renal failure were treated with CAVHD for periods ranging from two to 40 days. Urea clearances approached 37 L/d, and in stable patients, the BUN was maintained at 40 to 60 mg/dL and serum creatinine 1.4 to 4.0 mg/dL. Ultrafiltration up to 1 L/h could be obtained without difficulty.

We, therefore, studied retrospectively a cohort of 59 patients who underwent bone biopsy at two hospital-based dialysis centers in Montreal (water aluminum content less than 10 micrograms/L). Overall, 25% of patients biopsied had aluminum-related osteomalacia defined by aluminum staining of more than 30% of the trabecular surface and low levels of bone formation as measured by tetracycline labeling. Multiple linear regression analysis showed high predialysis serum creatinine (P less than .05) and the amount of aluminum prescribed per month (P less than .05) as the most important determinants of aluminum staining. We conclude that aluminum-related osteomalacia can be a frequent disease entity in areas of low water-aluminum content. Our findings also suggest predialysis serum creatinine and the amount of aluminum prescribed per month are risk factors for the development of aluminum-related osteomalacia. Though the relationship between serum creatinine and aluminum staining of trabecular bone is unclear, serum creatinine is probably a marker for adequacy of dialysis in these patients.\r"

In one of the two patients, chronic calcium repletion with high dialysate calcium was associated with significant improvement in cardiac symptoms and a decrease in left ventricular dilatation.

We have investigated the effect of the apo-E polymorphism on quantitative plasma levels of apo E, apo B, and total cholesterol in a sample of 563 blood-bank donors from Marburg and Giessen, West Germany. The relative frequencies of the epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4 alleles are .063, .793, and .144, respectively. The average effects of the epsilon 2 allele are to raise apo-E levels by 0.95 mg/dl, lower apo B levels by 9.46 mg/dl, and lower total cholesterol levels by 14.2 mg/dl. The average effects of the epsilon 4 allele are to lower apo-E levels by 0.19 mg/dl, to raise apo-B levels by 4.92 mg/dl, and to raise total cholesterol levels by 7.09 mg/dl. The average effects of the epsilon 3 allele are near zero for all three phenotypes. The apo-E polymorphism accounts for 20% of the variability of plasma apo-E levels, 12% of the variability of plasma apo-B levels, and 4% of the variability of total plasma cholesterol levels. The inverse relationship between the genotype-specific average apo-E levels and both the genotype-specific average apo-B and cholesterol levels is offset by a positive relationship between apo-E levels and both apo-B and cholesterol levels within an apo-E genotype. The apo-E polymorphism also has a direct effect on the correlation between apo-E and total cholesterol levels. The implication of these results on multivariate genetic analyses of these phenotypes is discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chromosomes were isolated from primary cultures 2-5 wk after amniocentesis, stained with Hoechst 33258 and chromomycin A3, and analyzed using dual beam flow cytometry. Information about chromosome DNA content and DNA base composition was derived from the locations of the peaks in the flow karyotypes, each peak being produced by one or more chromosome types with similar DNA content and DNA base composition. Information about the relative frequency of each chromosome type was determined on the basis of the relative volume of the peak for that chromosome type. Cytogenetic information determined on the basis of flow karyotypes was compared with that obtained by visual analysis following G-banding. Variability among the peak means and volumes in flow karyotypes was determined from analyses of 50 normal amniocyte cultures. Numerical aberrations involving chromosomes 21, 18, and Y were detected correctly in all of 28 analyses, including eight in a blind study. Structural aberrations involving chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9-12, 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 were detected in all of seven cultures in a blind study. Flow karyotypes proved to be insensitive to small, normally occurring chromosome polymorphisms detected by banding analysis. In addition, a few samples were erroneously scored as having numerical aberrations.\r"

  ".W": "Fibroblast cultures from six unrelated patients having a familial type of immunodeficiency combined with microcephaly, developmental delay, and chromosomal instability were studied with respect to their response to ionizing radiation. The cells from five of them resembled those from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) in that they were two to three times more radiosensitive on the basis of clonogenic cell survival. In addition, after exposure to either X-rays or bleomycin, they showed an inhibition of DNA replication that was less pronounced than that in normal cells and characteristic of AT fibroblasts. However, the patients are clinically very different from AT patients, not showing any signs of neurocutaneous symptoms. Genetic complementation studies in fused cells, with the radioresistant DNA synthesis used as a marker, showed that the patients' cells could complement representatives of all presently known AT complementation groups. Furthermore, they were shown to constitute a genetically heterogeneous group as well. It is concluded that these patients are similar to AT patients with respect to cytological parameters. The clinical differences between these patients and AT patients are a reflection of genetic heterogeneity. The data indicate that the patients suffer from a chromosome-instability syndrome that is distinct from AT.\r"

  ".W": "Although \"ecogenetics\" seeks to examine genetically mediated differences in susceptibility to environmental agents, researchers often examine the relation between genetic markers and disease without regard to environmental determinants. By using epidemiologic definitions of genotype-environment interaction, it can be shown that the relative risk of disease for the genetic marker is a function of the frequency of exposure to the environmental agent, the strength of interaction between the genotype and the agent, and the specificity of the environmental effect vis-a-vis the genotype. Using examples from the literature, we illustrate under six patterns of genotype-environment interaction that the relative risk associated with the marker can fluctuate markedly. However, with infrequent exposures, the relative risk is close to unity (implying no genetic effect) even in the face of strong genotype-environment interaction. Alternatively, elevated relative risks imply a frequent environmental exposure or a strong pattern of interaction. We suggest that genetic marker-disease associations be evaluated within the context of an epidemiologic study design that considers specific environmental determinants of risk.\r"

Patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriographic results also had significantly higher psychologic scores on indices of anxiety and depression and were significantly more likely to meet criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, for panic disorder (43 percent versus 6.5 percent), major depression (36 percent versus 4 percent), and two or more phobias (36 percent versus 15 percent) than were patients with chest pain and a coronary arteriography study demonstrating coronary artery stenosis.\r"

Glycolic acid was the major cause of the metabolic acidosis in both cases; lactate levels were only slightly elevated. Kinetic calculations showed that both ethylene glycol and glycolate were distributed in total body water with plasma half-lives of 8.4 and 7.0 hours, respectively. The half-life of ethylene glycol was increased more than 10-fold by ethanol treatment alone. Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria was dominant in both cases, but in one was preceded by a short period with mainly dihydrate excretion; crystalluria was not present upon admission. Repetitive urine microscopy in search of needle- or envelope-shaped crystals should be performed when ethylene glycol intoxication is suspected.\r"

Eight had symptoms of respiratory obstruction, two had dysphagia, and the others sought treatment for cosmetic reasons. After administration of iodine-131, there was a significant decrease in goiter size in 11 of the 14 patients, and all those with obstructive symptoms showed improvement. No significant local side effects occurred, but hypothyroidism and Graves' disease each occurred once during follow-up from one to 13 years. Radioactive iodine in doses of 20 to 100 mCi is an effective, safe therapeutic alternative in patients with large non-toxic multinodular goiter, particularly when there is recurrence following surgery or when there are contraindications to surgery.\r"

Postoperatively, iPTH decreased rapidly from an initial mean (+/- SD) of 2,928 +/- 1,600 muleq/ml and remained at 365 +/- 296 muleq/ml at last follow-up of patients still undergoing hemodialysis (normal, less than 50 muleq/ml). Of six patients who had recurrent hyperparathyroidism (10 percent of total), three required a second subtotal parathyroidectomy. Aluminum-related osteomalacia eventually developed in six patients with bone biopsy-proven hyperparathyroidism before parathyroidectomy. Nine patients with severe fracturing bone disease and hypercalcemia preoperatively but without clear evidence of hyperparathyroidism did not show a favorable response to subtotal parathyroidectomy (high mortality within 28 months, persistence of hypercalcemia, and symptomatic bone disease). Thus, subtotal parathyroidectomy can benefit patients with clearly established severe progressive hyperparathyroidism not responsive to medical therapy but is contraindicated in patients with low iPTH values and no bone biopsy evidence of severe hyperparathyroidism.\r"

In order to improve diagnostic accuracy (ventricular versus supraventricular tachycardia), the answers to two key bedside questions were prospectively evaluated: (1) Had the patient experienced a prior myocardial infarction? (2) Did symptoms of tachyarrhythmia start only after the infarction? A patient presenting with a wide QRS tachycardia was considered to have ventricular tachycardia if he or she answered in the affirmative to both of these questions. Of 31 consecutive patients referred with electrocardiographically documented sustained wide QRS tachycardia that was reproduced in the electrophysiology laboratory, the diagnoses made when the patients first presented to medical attention were ventricular tachycardias in 17 patients and supraventricular tachycardias in 14 patients. Following electrophysiologic evaluation, 29 were diagnosed as having ventricular tachycardia and two as supraventricular tachycardia. If the diagnoses were made solely on the basis of responses to the bedside questions mentioned earlier, 28 of the 29 patients having a final diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia would have been correctly identified. It is concluded that the use of these two questions can be very helpful in improving the clinical diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Further analysis demonstrated a significant association of the epidemic cases with bloodstream isolation of the organism (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Mortality associated with bacteremia caused by P. cepacia was 38 percent. Intensive investigation of the intensive care unit and its surrounding environment eventually demonstrated that a blood gas analyzer in a satellite laboratory adjacent to the intensive care unit was the reservoir for the outbreak.

  ".W": "Thirty-five patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and central nervous system toxoplasmosis, seen over a 30-month period, were treated with the combination pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine. All patients had clinical and computed tomographic scan findings consistent with active neurotoxoplasmosis. Mean duration of total therapy was six months. During the first two months of therapy, four patients died of acute neurotoxoplasmosis and 31 showed improvement. Of the 24 patients evaluable for long-term therapy, 14 (58 percent) achieved complete resolution and 10 had late clinical (n = 7) and/or computed tomographic scan (n = 6) sequelae. Six patients experienced 10 relapses, which occurred within six weeks of treatment discontinuation in seven of 10. Reintroduction of the combination led to complete resolution of the relapse in eight cases. These clinical results were correlated with brain anatomic findings in the 15 autopsied cases. Side effects, noted in 25 of 35, were mainly hematologic toxicity (n = 21) and cutaneous rash (n = 12). However, the combination had to be definitively stopped in only two cases and sulfadiazine alone had to be withdrawn in eight other cases. These data suggest that pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine is highly efficacious in neurotoxoplasmosis and that life-long therapy is needed to prevent relapses in patients with AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Of 117 employees seen consecutively in the Tennessee State Employee Health Service voluntary screening program, 86 (74%) had cholesterol levels above the reference range reported by a commercial clinical laboratory. This was three times greater than the calculated expected number of 29 (25%, 17 at moderate risk, 12 at high risk for coronary disease). Age and sex adjustment using Lipid Research Clinic guidelines reduced the number with elevated cholesterol to 55 (47%, 24 at moderate risk, 31 at high risk). Split sample cholesterol assays run independently by the commercial laboratory and a university laboratory showed excellent correlation (r = 0.99, commercial laboratory = 1.0 (university laboratory) + 10.8), but a systematic difference of 12.4 mg/dL (SD = 6.4 mg/dL, paired-t = 9.63, p less than 0.00001) between the two laboratories. Further adjustment for this difference reduced the number with elevated cholesterol to 41 (36%, 26 at moderate risk, 15 at high risk). This experience illustrates how small systematic laboratory errors in cholesterol determination can greatly exaggerate the number of persons reported to have clinically important cholesterol elevations. Clinical laboratories should report age and sex adjusted cholesterol reference ranges and provide clients periodic quality assurance reports that their measurements of cholesterol levels are accurate.\r"

Preoperative testing revealed elevated TSH and alpha-subunit with no response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) but a normal response in prolactin to TRH. Culture of the pituitary cells showed release of TSH, alpha-subunit and prolactin. In vitro, TRH failed to cause TSH discharge; however, it increased prolactin concentrations in the culture medium. Triiodothyronine, added to the pituitary cell culture, resulted in no inhibition of TSH and prolactin discharge. By electron microscopy, the adenoma cells showed features of thyrotrophs. However, some adenoma cells contained fibrous bodies characteristic of some growth hormone cell tumors and acidophil stem cell adenomas, suggesting that the adenoma originated in a common progenitor cell.\r"

The second patient's platelet level fell from 725,000 to 105,000 per mm3 on the tenth day of therapy. In both instances, platelet levels gradually returned to normal levels.

The response indicates: (a) that the sequelae sleep apnea in acromegaly can be improved even when ablative therapy of the pituitary is impossible and (b) bromocriptine may prevent perioperative complications caused by clinically significant airway obstruction in patients with acromegaly.\r"

In control patients treated with anticancer drugs containing cisplatin but no supplemental fosfomycin or steroids, the 24-hour urine NAG level increased two-fold (15.5 +/- 7.5, p less than 0.01) over the pretreatment level (8.0 +/- 5.2) 3 days after anticancer therapy. Supplemental fosfomycin or steroids inhibited an increase in urinary NAG level 3 days after the anticancer therapy. There were, however, no significant changes in creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels before and after anticancer and/or supplemental therapies. These results suggest the possibility that supplemental treatment with fosfomycin, like that with steroids, reduces cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, especially proximal tubular damage.\r"

Twelve patients were immediately delivered because of fetal distress, labor, or mature fetal pulmonary studies. Thirty-two patients entered an expectant management protocol. The cervical cerclage was removed on admission to the study. These patients were compared with 32 matched control subjects. There appears to be no difference in neonatal or maternal outcome between the study and control groups. The latency period from premature rupture of the membranes until delivery was not affected by the presence or removal of the cerclage. There was no difference in infectious complications. These data suggest that the presence of a cervical cerclage at the time of preterm premature rupture of the membranes does not increase the risk of delivery or infectious morbidity as long as the cerclage is removed early in the management protocol.\r"

Samples were obtained from 17 appropriate for gestational age and eight small for gestational age infants at cesarean section, while three small for gestational age fetuses were studied in utero by transabdominal cord sampling by means of ultrasonic guidance. Small for gestational age fetuses have significantly lower concentrations of alpha-aminonitrogen, compared with those of appropriate for gestational age fetuses, in both the umbilical artery and vein. Most of the difference is accounted for by the branched chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. In contrast, hydroxyproline concentration is significantly higher in both the umbilical artery and vein of small for gestational age fetuses. The sum of the branched chain amino acid concentrations in the umbilical vein is directly related to maternal arterial values in both appropriate for gestational age and small for gestational age fetuses. Maternal arterial concentrations were slightly lower in small for gestational age fetuses and the regression analysis of umbilical venous versus maternal arterial branched chain amino acid concentrations was significantly different for small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age infants. Umbilical venoarterial concentration differences in normal fetuses are significantly positive for most essential amino acids and for total alpha-aminonitrogen. In contrast, these differences were significant only for four essential amino acids in small for gestational age infants, while the total alpha-aminonitrogen venoarterial difference was not significant. The data obtained by transabdominal cord sampling from relatively undisturbed fetuses were in agreement with the data obtained at cesarean section; this information suggests that these differences between small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age infants reflected steady-state conditions.\r"

Ninety-eight mammographically guided, needle-localized breast biopsies were performed on 89 patients (8.0%). Twenty-one nonpalpable breast cancers (22.0%) were diagnosed in 18 patients with these methods. Treatment alternatives chosen in patients with positive biopsy specimens are presented. The importance of establishing consistent criteria for mammography and breast biopsy in the early diagnosis of localized breast cancer is discussed. The unique opportunity of the gynecologist to change the morality rate of breast cancer is emphasized.\r"

In six patients in whom omentum was unsuitable, we have substituted polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Sommerville, New Jersey) mesh to form a pelvic \"lid.\" In these patients, omentum was either densely adherent in the upper abdomen because of prior surgery or was removed as part of surgical treatment for recurrent cancer. Vicryl mesh formed a \"lid\" across the true pelvis. No gastrointestinal complications occurred in these patients. Four patients developed pelvic infections that resolved after surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. No patients developed peritonitis above the pelvis. No chronic infections have been found in more than 12 to 48 months of follow-up. In this preliminary experience, Vicryl mesh appears to be useful for the formation of a pelvic \"lid\" after exenterative pelvic surgery when the omentum is unavailable.\r"

Of 140 fluids tested, none harbored chlamydiae, and only one harbored mycoplasma, M. hominis. A number of amniotic fluids were subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these microorganisms. Amniotic fluids and chlamydial suspensions in a 2:1 ratio were incubated 30 to 90 minutes before their inoculation in McCoy cells. Procedures were followed for chlamydial isolation. Genital mycoplasmas were incubated with amniotic fluid samples for 24 or 48 hours at 35 degrees C. Growth in amniotic fluid specimens was compared with growth in pseudoamniotic fluid and broth controls. Fourteen amniotic fluid specimens collected from gestations of 16 to 40 weeks, were found to be inhibitory to the formation of inclusions of C. trachomatis in McCoy cells. Ten amniotic fluid specimens (16 to 39 weeks, gestation) demonstrated various degrees of inhibition against M. hominis, and three fluids were inhibitory to the growth of Ureaplasma. The inhibitor was heat and protease resistant and activity was proportional to concentration. The molecular weight of the inhibitor was probably greater than 10,000 daltons, and pH, although perhaps a contributing factor, was not the cause of the inhibition.\r"

The median values for plasma zinc, red blood cell zinc, and alkaline phosphatase were used as cutoff points to subdivide the patient population into \"low\" and \"high\" groups. Low levels of maternal plasma zinc were associated with more complications in the antenatal or intrapartum periods than maternal levels of either alkaline phosphatase or red blood cell zinc. Plasma zinc levels less than the median value were more commonly associated with mild toxemia (p = 0.02), vaginitis (p = 0.01), and postdates (p = 0.01) in the antenatal period. During the intrapartum period, low plasma zinc levels were associated with a prolonged latent phase (p = 0.05), a protracted active phase (p = 0.04), labor greater than 20 hours (p = 0.03), second stage greater than 2.5 hours (p = 0.01), and cervical and vaginal lacerations (p = 0.02). Low levels of maternal alkaline phosphatase were strongly associated with a history of previous stillbirth (p = 0.0005). A low maternal red blood cell zinc level was not associated with complications during either period. Since a low plasma zinc level is a valid predictor of pregnancy complications and abnormal labor, the results suggest that plasma zinc screening, as part of the patient's antenatal workup should be evaluated.\r"

Most of the thymectomized mice showed irregular estrous cycles during the first several weeks and then fell into continuous diestrus. Local infiltration of mononuclear and plasma cells inside and around growing follicles was a prominent feature in the early stage of oophoritis. This abnormal feature was first noticed at 24 days of age and progressed in the follicular units. Acute loss of oocytes, especially of growing follicles, with massive mononuclear cell infiltration rapidly progressed after puberty, and atrophic ovaries with complete destruction of both primordial and growing follicles were then seen for 1 to 2 months after puberty. In mice with oophoritis, circulating autoantibodies against, ooplasm, zona pellucida, or steroid-producing cells were constantly detected by immunohistochemical assay. Autoimmune thyroiditis and gastritis accompanied by specific circulating antibodies were also detected in mice thymectomized at 3 days of age. This experimental model may serve as a tool for studying premature ovarian failure in humans.\r"

With both circulations open, the transfer index (clearance of riboflavin: clearance of antipyrine) toward the fetus was 3.3 +/- 0.08 (+/- SD) versus 0.87 +/- 0.02 in the reverse direction (p less than 0.01). Galactoflavin reduced the materno-fetal transfer rate. The uptake of riboflavin and L-glucose after bolus injection into the maternal perfusate was 35% +/- 9.6% versus 3% +/- 16%, p = 0.005, which indicates an uptake rate in excess of diffusion. There was no significant difference in uptake at the fetal surface. With recirculation of either the maternal or fetal perfusate, the transplacental gradient that was established was lower at high concentrations of riboflavin, which indicates the saturability of this function. Riboflavin was concentrated in the intracellular space and partly metabolized to flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. An equilibrium was approximated when both perfusates were recirculated, with the concentration lowest in the maternal perfusate, highest in the placenta, and intermediate in the fetal perfusate. It is concluded that the major factor directing riboflavin toward the fetus is the difference in rates of uptake at the two surfaces of the placenta.\r"

If amniotic fluid has a direct role in depressing cardiac function in amniotic fluid embolism, it may act by decreasing coronary flow rather than by directly suppressing myocardial activity.\r"

A single infusion of 100 or 500 mg of each drug resulted in a concentration of 200 to 1000 micrograms/ml immediately after infusion, and the concentration remained above 10 micrograms/ml for about 24 hours without significant increase in fetal or maternal blood levels. Consequently, a daily single dose of 100 mg or more is probably effective prophylaxis in cases of premature rupture of membranes. When intrauterine infection is suspected, the dose can be increased to 500 mg or more, and transplacental administration may be added to achieve a higher concentration in fetal blood. The present study simulates well premature rupture of membranes, and an amnioinfusion of antibiotics will be reliable and effective in managing premature rupture of membranes.\r"

We conclude that vaginal colonization by yeasts is commonly associated with vulvovaginal symptoms, often in the absence of positive potassium hydroxide wet preparation results. These data suggest that vaginal specimens from women who have vulvovaginal symptoms and negative potassium hydroxide wet preparation results should be cultured for fungi before the diagnosis of fungal vulvovaginitis is excluded.\r"

Because of its presence in pregnancy, investigators have suggested that digoxin-like immunoreactive substance may play an etiologic role in the development of preeclampsia. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationship between maternal digoxin-like immunoreactive substance and gestational age and compare digoxin-like immunoreactive substance concentrations in patients with and without preeclampsia who were in the third trimester. Two hundred twenty patients were studied during either the first (n = 53), second (n = 56), or third (n = 111) trimester of pregnancy. Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance was undetectable in the serum of patients during the first trimester; however, 11% of second-trimester and 96% of third-trimester patients had measurable levels of serum digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (p less than 0.05). The mean +/- SEM concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance in serum in third-trimester patients was 0.29 +/- 0.01 ng/ml (range 0 to 0.58 ng/ml). Gestational age at delivery was significantly lower in patients with preeclampsia than in those without preeclampsia (36.3 +/- 0.6 versus 38.8 +/- 0.4 weeks; p less than 0.001). In addition, there was no statistical difference in mean +/- SEM concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance between 27 patients without preeclampsia (0.32 +/- 0.02 ng/ml) and 27 patients with preeclampsia (0.30 +/- 0.02 ng/ml; p = 0.47) matched for gestational age. We conclude that (1) digoxin-like immunoreactive substance appearance and increasing serum concentration during pregnancy are correlated with increasing gestational age and (2) there is no difference in digoxin-like immunoreactive substance values between patients with and without preeclampsia, which may exclude digoxin-like immunoreactive substance as a predictor of preeclampsia.\r"

The study population included: group 1, 14 preeclamptic women receiving magnesium sulfate and undergoing induction of labor; group 2, six preeclamptic women studied in the postpartum period while receiving magnesium sulfate; and group 3, 10 normotensive women undergoing induction of labor. The neuromuscular transmission studies were performed with standard techniques before and during the administration of magnesium sulfate. During magnesium sulfate therapy patients in groups 1 and 2 showed abnormal responses characterized by an initial low-amplitude muscle action potential followed by a progressive increase in the amplitudes of the successive responses. There was significant correlation between the degree of the neuromuscular transmission defect and serum magnesium levels, serum calcium levels, and the magnesium/calcium ratio in groups 1 and 2. All studies were normal in group 3. The findings confirm the occurrence of abnormal neuromuscular transmission in preeclamptic women receiving magnesium sulfate, and the intensity of the defect correlates significantly with increased serum magnesium levels and decreased serum calcium levels.\r"

Response decrement, or habituation, is thought to reflect higher central nervous system function. Two hundred women with uncomplicated pregnancies, who were subsequently delivered of healthy infants at term, were studied between 26 and 41 weeks' gestation. After ultrasound views of the fetal face were obtained, a vibratory acoustic stimulus was applied repetitively to the maternal abdomen near the fetal head. Response decrement was defined as cessation of all components of the facial reaction, except eye blinking, over two sequential stimuli. Three response patterns were scored: (1) no startle, (2) startle without response decrement, and (3) response decrement by 12 stimuli. Whereas only 53% of fetuses between 26 and 27 weeks displayed startle reaction, all fetuses displayed startle responses by 28 weeks. As gestational age advances, an increasing number of fetuses exhibit response decrement, from no decrement at 26 to 27 weeks to 100% decrement at 40 to 41 weeks. A maturation of neurobehavioral response patterns takes place in normal third-trimester pregnancies. Response decrement testing may be a useful tool for in utero neurologic evaluation.\r"

IgG (22.4%) and IgM (21.1%) antisperm antibodies predominated in sera of women who did not conceive, whereas IgA (37.5%) and IgG (37.5%) antibodies were most prevalent in sera of women with miscarriages. In men, the presence of antisperm antibodies in sera was unrelated to fertility. However, there was a correlation between sperm surface antibodies and an inability to conceive. IgG was identified on ejaculated spermatozoa from eight of 76 (10.5%) men whose wives failed to conceive and in none of 33 men whose wives conceived. Similarly, IgA was present on spermatozoa from 16 (21.1%) infertile and two (6.1%) fertile men. Thus antisperm antibodies in female sera and on ejaculated spermatozoa were associated with a failure to conceive and first-trimester miscarriage.\r"

All had cephalic presentations (greater than 33 weeks of gestation) and were screened with a 15-minute fetal heart rate recording (admission test) before the sound stimulation was applied. Three different types of responses were observed: type I, an accelerative response; type II, a biphasic response with acceleration(s) followed by a deceleration; type III, no response or a prolonged deceleration (greater than 60 beats/min and greater than 60 seconds). A type I response was recorded in 98.0% of the women after a reactive admission test result, in 90.2% after an equivocal admission test result, and in 42.9% after an ominous admission test result. Fetal distress in labor occurred in these three groups in 2.0%, 22.2%, and 35.7% of cases, respectively. The risk for fetal distress was high after an ominous admission test and a type III response on the fetal acoustic stimulation test (75.0%). The fetal acoustic stimulation test might be of value in labor and give additional information about fetal well-being in patients previously screened by the admission test. Testing time can be shortened after an equivocal admission test.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 184,567 singleton live births with gestational ages of 40 weeks were examined from the 1980-1984 Illinois birth certificate data to determine the independent effect of maternal age on the incidence of low birth weight at term. The incidence is highest in mothers less than 17 years of age (3.2%) and gradually declines with advancing maternal age to reach 1.3% in women aged 25 to 34 years. It increases to 1.7% for those greater than 35 years of age. To separate out the independent effect of maternal age on the incidence of low birth weight infants at term, the presence of other maternal factors, such as race, education, parity, marital status, and prenatal care, were adjusted by use of a series of multiple logistic regression analyses. All of these analyses consistently demonstrated that the adjusted risk for low birth weight at term is the lowest in teenagers and increases with advancing maternal age. These results indicate that the high incidence of this factor in young mothers apparently reflects their poor sociodemographic and prenatal care status. Advancing maternal age is associated with a decreased potential for fetal growth, possibly reflecting biologic aging of maternal tissues and systems or the cumulative effects of disease.\r"

The number of cases of cerebral palsy diagnosed by age 5 years varied little among cohorts of infants born between 1960 and 1982. Trends toward more intensive perinatal care, increasing frequency of cesarean section, and the increased use of electronic fetal monitoring to detect fetal distress were associated with decreases in perinatal mortality but not in cerebral palsy. The increase in survival of low birth weight infants has resulted in an increased number of children with cerebral palsy, but this has had a minimal impact on total cerebral palsy rates. These descriptive trends raise doubts about the relationship between cerebral palsy and perinatal events, the effects of obstetric and neonatal interventions in reducing cerebral palsy, and the use of cerebral palsy data as an index of perinatal care practices.\r"

Patients with gestational trophoblastic disease tended to consume several foods less frequently, including the major sources of vitamin A and animal protein in the Italian diet. Relative risk estimates were significantly below unity in both control groups for green vegetable, carrot, liver, and cheese consumption and in the obstetric control group only for milk, meat, eggs, fresh fruit, and fish. Inverse relationships emerged between the risk of gestational trophoblastic disease and beta-carotene or retinol intake index. The trend of decreasing risk with increasing intake was significant for beta-carotene consumption. The present findings confirm that various aspects of diet may influence the risk of gestational trophoblastic disease. However, the limitation of available evidence still introduces serious uncertainties in the interpretation of these findings and suggests the potential importance of further epidemiologic and biochemical research to obtain more precise definition of specific dietary correlates of gestational trophoblastic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Essential infantile esotropia is an early acquired, not a congenital, condition, although congenital factors may favor its development between the ages of 3 and 6 months. It must be distinguished from other forms of esotropia with an onset between birth and the first six months of life. The cause of essential infantile esotropia remains unknown, but advances in our knowledge can be expected from the rapidly emerging discipline of infant psychophysics. In analyzing treatment results, a clear distinction must be made between normal, subnormal, and anomalous forms of binocular cooperation. While complete restoration of normal binocular function is rarely, if ever, achieved, anomalous binocular cooperation has many functional advantages over suppression or diplopia and should not be disturbed by overzealous treatment. Subnormal binocular vision is considered to be an optimal, microtropia a desirable, and a residual small angle heterotropia an acceptable end stage of surgical therapy. In a study of 358 surgically treated patients with a documented onset of essential infantile esotropia before age 6 months, subnormal binocular vision was present in 71 (20%), a microtropia in 25 (7%), and a small angle esotropia or exotropia in 140 (39%) of the patients. Surgical alignment before completion of the second year of life improved the chances for an optimal treatment result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Growth of the lesion was unpredictable. Visual loss occurred in eight of 16 eyes during the first six months of follow-up. Recurrent neovascularization after photocoagulation originated in some patients from outside the pretreatment subretinal complex. Of the 15 patients with bilateral involvement, 13 had juxtapapillary lesions. Fellow eyes in patients with unilateral juxtapapillary lesions showed no predisposing abnormality at or near the nerve head. The prevalence, density, and fluorescein angiographic characteristics of drusen were different from those in age- and sex-matched patients with macular neovascularization.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain whether the pattern of fluid accumulation could be altered by an agent introduced through the airways, the authors studied the physiology and morphology of 11 dogs exposed to 150-494 ppm.hr NO2 and compared them with 3 new and 5 previously reported control dogs. NO2 caused a partly reversible decrease in systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output, a fall in arterial PO2, and rapid shallow breathing, while pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures remained normal. Post mortem, lower (LL) and middle (ML) lobes were frozen, sections fixed for light microscopy by freeze-substitution, and wet weight/dry weight (W/D) ratios were measured. Alveolar edema was graded, and the distribution of interstitial edema around arteries and veins and within bronchovascular bundles was studied with morphometry: edema ratios (ER) were calculated as area of interstitium/area of vessel or airway. We found that NO2 produced an exposure-dependent increase in lung water (r = 0.73), and that both LL and ML had similar W/D ratios (7.77 and 8.39, respectively) and percent alveolar edema (30% and 34%). Morphometry of interstitial edema showed that the ER for vessels and airways of edematous LL were essentially similar to controls, while those of the ML were markedly increased. It is concluded that NO2 produces exposure-related lung edema and preferential alveolar flooding with probable secondary interstitial accumulation. The discrepancies in interstitial edema between middle and lower lobes may be due to differences in lung volume or in ventilation.\r"

  ".U": "88103959\r", 
  ".W": "One of the hallmarks of tissue necrosis produced by the human protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of human amebiasis, appeared to be the lack of inflammatory reaction to the invading trophozoites. Recent evidence suggests, however, that inflammatory cells do appear during early stages of amebic destructive lesions and that they contribute to the establishment of foci of tissue necrosis in intestinal and liver lesions. The present analysis of the fine-structural changes that take place during early stages of amebic liver abscesses induced in hamsters after the intraportal inoculation of axenic amebas has shown that large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are recruited around invading amebas. These leukocytes lyse as a consequence of contact-mediated damage induced by the trophozoites. Amebas were also capable of ingesting apparently intact PMNs. Macrophages and eosinophils were also recruited at the foci of inflammation. At all times examined, trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica survived in spite of being in close contact with PMNs or degranulating eosinophils. The ultrastructural observations have also shown the lack of direct contact between amebas and liver parenchymal cells during the initial stages of the focal liver necrosis induced by the parasite, therefore supporting the view that hepatic damage may be effected indirectly through lysis of inflammatory cells. The results also provide a basis for the understanding of the induction of experimental protective immunity against invasive amebiasis, a process which seems to be mostly dependent on cellular mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The essential component of pulmonary emphysema is destruction of alveoli. Because capillaries make up much of the alveolar wall, it has been a long-held opinion that capillary loss in this disease parallels the loss of other elements of the alveolar septum. Yet the nature of the damage to capillaries and the occurrence of microvascular remodeling are unknown. Scanning electron microscopy of vascular casts of lungs from rats given intratracheal elastase were studied for identifying capillary changes in this type of experimental emphysema. The pressure-volume curves showed a clear distinction between the elastase and saline control animals, and light microscopy showed alveolar enlargement consistent with mild emphysema. The casts of capillaries in the elastase lungs appeared to have larger alveolar baskets, and capillaries ended abruptly near areas of focally destroyed lung. The elastase animals had more nonconnecting capillary segments on the pleural surface where the emphysema was worse and folds in the capillaries were more pronounced, suggesting weakened alveolar walls. The capillary density was decreased on the pleural surface, although this decrease could have resulted from hyperinflation. No difference in capillary diameters or branching frequency occurred. It appears that in this model of emphysema, decreased elastic recoil occurs before diffuse loss of capillaries.\r"

  ".W": "X-ray-induced, lymphoblastic, T-cell lymphoma/leukemias from irradiated RF mice were observed to uniformly expressed a 44-kd oncofetal antigen (OFA). The OFA polypeptide was detected by flow cytometry, affinity column SDS-PAGE analysis, and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 115 prepared against syngeneic mouse fetus. X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) induced murine fibrosarcoma cell lines, used as classic models in radiation biology, were also found to express the OFA, which suggested that the 44-kd OFA was a general transformation marker of tumors. Adult mouse thymocytes and other adult tissues expressed no OFA. The 44-kd polypeptide was located at the surface membrane of the tumors examined. In contrast to other reports, lymphoblastic lymphoma cell lines expressed the OFA as a cross-protective, rather than an individually-specific, tumor-associated transplantation antigen. Pronase treatment removed OFA from the surface of living lymphoma cells, whereas collagenase, neuraminidase, and hyaluronidase did not. The OFA was rapidly reexpressed upon culture of the pronase-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the 44-kd OFA polypeptide described here may provide a useful cell surface marker for future radiation carcinogenesis studies. MAb 115 is a promising reagent for detecting tumor-associated 44-kd OFA, for assessing immunoregulatory perturbations to the OFA caused by radiation damage and for investigating the immunopathology of OFA-associated radiation damage.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen from a Chlamydia trachomatis biovar, mouse pneumonitis agent (MoPn), was used to produce an inflammatory arthritis by inoculation in the knee joints of C57B1/6 mice. The production of arthritis was strongly dependent on prior sensitization to chlamydiae by subcutaneous immunization in either sex or genital infection in females. In unimmunized animals quantitatively less inflammation, fibrin exudation, and pannus formation developed than in immunized counterparts. In neither uninjected nor McCoy or HeLa Cell antigen-treated joints did arthritis develop. The arthritis produced was more pronounced at 7 than at 2 days after intraarticular challenge and showed minimal residual changes at 21 days. Residual changes included subsynovial hyperplasia. In genitally infected female mice less severe arthropathy developed than in subcutaneously immunized female mice after intraarticular challenge with formalin-inactivated chlamydial antigen. However, in infected mice challenged with chlamydiae inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation a severe arthritis with destructive pannus developed, suggesting alteration of antigenicity by formalin inactivation. The strong association of the arthritis with the presence of chlamydial antibody suggests its use as a model of human Reiter's disease in which prior sensitization to Chlamydia is an important factor.\r"

The vascularization of the cornea was quantified by means of an image analyzer. In addition, the effects of antiinflammatory compounds, dexamethasone and flurbiprofen, on the angiogenic response to CuSO4 were examined. Elvax pellets containing 10-75 micrograms of CuSO4 implanted in the corneal stroma dose-dependently induced neovascularization, which persisted for more than 64 days at the highest dose. Manual measurements of blood vessel lengths and image analysis measurements of blood vessel areas were comparable during the growth phase of vascularization, but only the image analysis measurements detected a subsequent regression phase. Therefore, the length method of measurement is only useful during the growth phase, whereas the image analysis method is useful during both the growth and regression phases of vascularization. Dexamethasone (50 micrograms, applied topically, three times a day) and flurbiprofen (100 micrograms, applied topically, three times a day) suppressed the inflammation produced by corneal implants containing 75 micrograms CuSO4. However, each drug only inhibited vascular growth by 50% during the 14 days of treatment. Although CuSO4 is not an endogenous angiogenic factor, the model presented in this report may be useful in quantitative evaluation of anti-angiogenic agents.\r"

TLI varies between 0.04% and 5.7% and declines with increasing age. There is no difference in mean TLI between OC users and nonusers if correction is made for the difference in age distribution between these two groups. Immunohistochemical detection of immunoglobulin A (IgA), secretory component (SC), and alpha-lactalbumin shows more frequent positive staining during artificial than natural menstrual cycles, and positive staining tends to be associated with higher TLI values. No significant variation in staining with cycle phase is detected in natural or artificial cycles. These results show that breast tissue does not resemble endometrium in the relationships that exist between proliferation, secretion, and menstrual cycle phase.\r"

Serum samples were assessed for their ability to induce neutrophil aggregation, neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cell monolayer, and superoxide anion generation. The results indicated that both blood- and plasma-derived sera induced similar increases in neutrophil aggregation. Both sera also induced neutrophil adherence to cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayer. The adherence increased in a time-dependent manner, producing little change after 5 minutes, and reached maximal response at 60 minutes. Full potency of the neutrophil adherence was evident with serum samples obtained after clotting time of 20 minutes but not at 5 minutes clotting time. The adherence-inducing activity of serum was gradually lost after storage at -20 C and was abolished by 100 C treatment for 2 minutes. In contrast, heating serum to 56 C for 30 minutes did not alter the adherence-inducing activity. Both ether and aqueous fractions obtained after ether extraction of serum possessed adherence-promoting activities, indicating that multiple factors (both lipid and water soluble) were involved. Pretreatment of the endothelium with serum resulted in increased endothelial adhesiveness, but the serum pretreatment failed to induce adhesiveness to subendothelial matrix, indicating that endothelial cells play an active role in acquiring the adhesive property. Serum obtained from thrombin-generated whole blood also resulted in a modest degree of neutrophil superoxide anion generation, but this did not occur with plasma-derived serum. The results indicate that serum factors obtained by clotting blood with thrombin induce neutrophil aggregation and neutrophil adherence to the endothelium as well as superoxide production. These factors appear to be generated in the plasma phase, because the responses were similar in blood- and plasma-derived serum.\r"

In newborn rats issued from gentamicin-treated mothers, the proximal tubular lumen of the mature nephron lying in the deepest cortex was dilated, and their proximal tubular cells exhibited extensive damage, resembling that described in tubular cells of adult rats exposed to gentamicin.

  ".W": "For investigation of the pathogenicity of lentivirus strains, which have distinctly different cytopathic phenotypes in synovial membrane cell culture, plaque-purified, lytic, and nonlytic ovine lentivirus (OvLV) isolates were inoculated intratracheally into two groups of neonatal lambs. Twelve lambs were inoculated with a lytic OvLV isolate and 3 lambs each with two nonlytic OvLV isolates. Five control lambs were inoculated with either virus-free medium or were left uninoculated. In 8 of 12 lambs inoculated with a lytic OvLV isolate mild to severe lesions of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia developed, 6 of 12 lambs had lesions of pulmonary lymph node follicular hyperplasia, 3 of 9 female lambs had lesions of lymphoproliferative mastitis, 3 of 10 lambs had lesions of lymphocytic/plasmacytic synovitis, and 3 lambs had no lesions. In 3 of 6 lambs inoculated with nonlytic OvLV isolates only mild LIP lesions developed, without concurrent mammary gland or joint lesions. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples from OvLV-diseased lambs contained on average 1.5-fold more numbers of total leukocytes, and 4-fold more numbers of lymphocytes, compared with bronchoalveolar lavage samples of normal lambs. Monoclonal antibodies to ovine lymphocyte surface markers showed that the SBU-T8+ lymphocyte (CD 8 equivalent) was the predominant lymphocyte subset (mean of 65% of total lavaged lymphocytes) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples of 3 diseased lambs. Ovine lentivirus was reisolated from multiple tissues of both groups of OvLV-inoculated lambs, but the percentage of individual tissues infected was greater in lambs inoculated with the lytic viral isolate. Control lambs had no lesions and failed to produce OvLV-specific antibodies or yield OvLV from tissues. All OvLV-inoculated lambs produced either low or undetectable serum virus neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, lambs inoculated with either lytic or nonlytic OvLV produced precipitating antibodies to OvLV glycoprotein and group-specific protein. However, initial detection of precipitating antibodies to OvLV glycoprotein was earlier (mean, 5.8 weeks after inoculation) in OvLV-infected lambs in which severe lymphoproliferative disease developed and delayed (mean, 10.2 weeks after inoculation) in OvLV-infected lambs with mild or no lesions. Together, these results suggest that lentivirus isolates produced disease in a virus strain-dependent manner and suggest that humoral immune responses against OvLV failed to prevent lesion development in lentivirus-infected lambs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Oval cells that proliferate in the liver of animals receiving a carcinogenic diet (choline-deficient, containing 0.05% ethionine) contained G6Pase activity; 50-60% of nonparenchymal epithelial cells isolated from these livers by centrifugal elutriation contained G6Pase activity; and oval cell cultures displayed intense G6Pase activity at confluence but did not have detectable enzyme activity during exponential growth. These results and the demonstration that clofibrate induces peroxisomal proliferation in cultured oval cells strengthen the view that oval cells (or some subpopulation of cells in this compartment) are part of the hepatocyte lineage.\r"
