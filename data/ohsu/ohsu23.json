  ".W": "A new method is described for continuously recording ATP release in isolated perfused hearts by a bioluminescence technique that makes possible the study of the dynamics of ATP release in terms of coronary vascular regulation. Infusion of exogenous ATP in isolated perfused rat hearts resulted in a clearance of 97.8 +/- 0.5% in one pass through the heart. Short-term infusion of either leukotriene (LT) D4 (0.02-0.5 nmol) or norepinephrine (NE; 0.06-0.6 mumol) released significant quantities of ATP from isolated rat hearts in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, equipotent vasoconstrictor doses of arginine vasopressin (AVP; 20 and 60 microU) failed to release ATP. The amount of ATP released by LTD4 and NE declined by 50 to 60% with each consecutive challenge. LTD4-induced vasoconstriction and ATP release were totally abolished by the LT receptor antagonist FPL-55,712, whereas the NE-induced coronary vasoconstriction and ATP release were totally blocked by the alpha adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine. The coronary vasoconstriction induced by NE was followed by a slight coronary vasodilation, which was inhibited by the beta adrenergic blocking agent timolol without influencing ATP release. The LTD4- and NE-induced release of ATP appears to be receptor mediated and may play a role in the regulation of coronary vascular tone.\r"

  ".U": "87112209\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic treatment of dogs with digoxin alone, quinidine alone and digoxin in combination with quinidine was initiated in dogs to assess changes in arrhythmogenic potential associated with the quinidine-induced increase in serum digoxin concentration observed during combined digoxin and quinidine treatment. The arrhythmogenic potential of digoxin was evaluated through the use of the acetylstrophanthidin (AcS) tolerance test. AcS was infused at a rate of 5 micrograms/kg/min until ventricular arrhythmias occurred during a drug-free period and during chronic treatment with digoxin, quinidine and digoxin plus quinidine. The dose of AcS required to initiate ventricular arrhythmias is inversely related to the arrhythmogenic potential of digoxin present at the time of AcS infusion. Administration of quinidine alone in two different dosage regimens produced serum quinidine concentrations of 5.99 +/- 1.18 and 2.99 +/- 0.43 micrograms/ml and significantly increased AcS tolerance, whereas digoxin alone, over a wide range of serum digoxin concentrations, significantly decreased AcS tolerance. This decrease in AcS tolerance was linearly related to the serum digoxin concentration. The addition of quinidine treatment to animals receiving digoxin resulted in a significant elevation in the steady-state serum digoxin concentration. However, the AcS tolerance determined during the elevated serum digoxin concentration induced by quinidine was greater than that determined during treatment with the same dose of digoxin alone. Thus, quinidine administration to animals receiving digoxin resulted in a significant increase in the steady-state serum digoxin concentration but did not increase the arrhythmogenic potential of digoxin over that observed during treatment with the same dose of digoxin alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study determined effects of three smoking behavior components: puff volume, inhalation volume and lung exposure duration on biological measures of smoke exposure. A microcomputer-based auditory feedback system allowed subjects (N = 9 or 10 per experiment) to control puff and inhalation parameters as they smoked usual brand cigarettes. In each of four experiments, one smoking parameter was manipulated across sessions while two other parameters were held constant. Biological samples were obtained before and after each 8-puff smoking session conducted under a given set of behavioral parameters for analysis of plasma nicotine and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) levels. In Experiment I, both nicotine and CO levels were influenced systematically as puff volume was varied from 15 to 60 ml (inhalation volume = 50% of vital capacity, lung exposure time = about 9 sec). Nicotine boost (post- minus presession levels) increased 4-fold and CO boost increased 9-fold over this range of puff volume values. In Experiment II, nicotine levels were unaffected when average lung exposure times varied from 5 to 21 sec (puff volume = 50 ml, inhalation volume = 50% of vital capacity), suggesting that all the nicotine available may be absorbed during a normal smoking inhalation cycle with no breathholding. CO levels increased systematically with longer breathholds. In Experiments III and IV, inhalation volumes from 10% and 20% to 60% of vital capacity had no effect on either nicotine or CO levels, and this was true whether lung exposure time was about 8 sec (Experiment III) or about 4 sec (Experiment IV). This series of studies has shown that puff volume is an important determinant of tobacco smoke exposure, but that inhalation components of smoking behavior, at least within the range of parameters tested, have no effect on nicotine exposure levels.\r"

The objective of this report is to investigate the effect of a single oral dose of PB on APAP hepatotoxicity in mice. PB was administered (150 mg/kg) 1 hr before oral administration of APAP (400 mg/kg). Blood, liver and urine were collected from mice at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after APAP treatment. Mortality rate and incidence of gross hepatic lesions were significantly higher in mice pretreated with PB than in mice treated with APAP alone. At 8, 12 and 24 hr post-APAP treatment, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase activity was significantly higher in mice receiving the combination treatment. Hepatic glutathione levels were significantly lower at 1 and 2 hr in mice pretreated with PB. Urinary excretion of APAP mercapturate, APAP sulfate and free APAP increased, whereas APAP glucuronide decreased, in mice pretreated with PB compared with mice treated with APAP alone. Covalent binding of [3H]APAP to hepatic microsomes was markedly increased after PB pretreatment. PB pretreatment was found to deplete uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid in livers of mice at 1 and 2 hr post-APAP treatment. These results indicate that the biochemical mechanism by which a single dose of PB enhances APAP hepatotoxicity does not involve cytochrome P-450 induction; interference with APAP glucuronidation may occur.\r"

  ".U": "87112214\r", 
  ".W": "Theophylline, the bronchodilating agent, can cause life-threatening, generalized seizures when plasma concentrations exceed the usual therapeutic concentration range. However, the plasma concentrations of theophylline associated with this neurotoxic effect vary widely between patients. To determine the reasons for the wide variation, and thereby to facilitate prevention or early treatment of theophylline-induced neurotoxicity, an animal model of theophylline-induced seizures was developed and has now been used to determine the effect of experimental renal failure on the concentrations of theophylline that cause convulsions. Adult female rats were subjected to bilateral ureteral ligation or injected with uranyl nitrate to produce renal failure or dysfunction. Sham-operated and saline-injected rats, respectively, served as controls. Theophylline was infused i.v. at either 1.03 or 2.06 mg/min until the onset of maximal seizures. Renal failure due to ureter ligation was associated with a substantial reduction of the dose of drug required to produce seizures, the concentrations of total and free (unbound) theophylline in serum and the concentrations of theophylline in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid at onset of seizures. The concentrations of theophylline metabolites were very low and did not account for the enhanced neurotoxicity. No apparent change in the neurotoxicity of theophylline was observed in rats with uranyl nitrate-induced renal dysfunction. The results of the investigation on ureter-ligated rats are consistent with recent clinical findings of a higher incidence of theophylline-induced neurotoxicity in azotemic patients. The experimental methodology may therefore be suitable for the prospective identification of other potential clinical risk factors for theophylline neurotoxicity.\r"

In female dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, the left lumbar sympathetic chain was excised from L1 to L7. After a 3- to 5-week period, the left (denervated) and right (innervated) saphenous veins were removed, cut into rings and suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Denervation reduced significantly the norepinephrine content of the venous rings and the contractile responses evoked by the indirect sympathomimetic amine, tyramine. The contractile responses evoked by exogenous norepinephrine were augmented by denervation under control conditions (16.7-fold shift in concentration-effect curve) and also after inhibition of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake and beta adrenoceptors (3.8-fold shift in curve). Denervation increased the contractile responses evoked by the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, UK 14,304 (5-fold shift in concentration-effect curve), but not those produced by the alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine. The selective augmentation of alpha-2 adrenergic responses by denervation may reflect the preferential innervation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the canine saphenous vein.\r"

Maternal viability was unaffected and weight gain was only reduced slightly, but nearly half the dams failed to give birth; dams delivering pups had normal litter sizes. Examination of fetal macromolecules on the 18th day of gestation revealed specific deficits in cell number (DNA) in developing brain tissue as opposed to the rest of the fetus, accompanied by parallel shortfalls in other macromolecules (RNA, protein). After birth, brain development in the nicotine-exposed animals showed persistent abnormalities in the timing of maturational events, with elevated levels of ornithine decarboxylase (an enzymatic marker related to cellular maturation) detectable in all brain regions. Subsequent effects on macromolecules were highly selective regionally, with clear distinctions between areas in which neuronal replication occurs relatively late (cerebellum) compared to early-developing regions (midbrain plus brainstem). Differences apparent between the effects of infused maternal nicotine and those noted previously in studies with nicotine injections indicate that the drug does exert primary effects on developing neural tissues, but that other factors associated with the injection route (such as hypoxia and ischemia consequent to acute effects of nicotine) can interact with the drug to influence brain cell maturation.\r"

Four Ca++ channel blockers (nitrendipine, nicardipine, nifedipine and verapamil) were effective in reducing the mortality. At the dose of 100 mg/kg nitrendipine and nicardipine gave 80 and 85% protection respectively. Whereas aspirin almost suppressed completely thromboxane (Tx)B2 and platelet factor-4 release after collagen-epinephrine infusion, neither nitrendipine nor nicardipine modified TxB2 release and only reduced slightly platelet factor-4 release. The treatment with aspirin, nitrendipine or nicardipine did not counteract the fall in circulating platelets counted 1 min after the aggregation challenge, but at 3 min platelet count was significantly higher in aspirin-treated mice than in animals given either Ca++ channel blocker. Mouse platelet aggregation induced in vitro by the combination of collagen and epinephrine was inhibited in samples obtained from mice pretreated with aspirin but was unaffected by the treatment with nitrendipine or nicardipine. The i.v. injection of a 12.5% suspension of hardened red blood cells resulted in death of about 80% of mice within 1 to 2 min. Neither circulating platelet count nor plasma TxB2 level were modified significantly by red cell injection. Aspirin was ineffective whereas both Ca++ channel blockers lowered mortality to 50%. These data suggest that Ca++ channel blockers reduce the mortality in the Mouse Antithrombotic Assay by influencing factors other than platelet aggregation and/or Tx production. These factors might be important in mediating mortality occurring after infusion of hardened red cells.\r"

The effect was maximal 40 min after treatment and had disappeared after 6 hr, when enzyme inhibition was still present. A displacing effect was also observed when SKF 525A was added in vitro to serum of rats, dogs and humans and to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, whereas binding to human serum albumin was not affected. SKF 525A was found to be equipotent with tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, a known displacer of binding of drugs from alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. When studying the pharmacokinetics or the effects of drugs after SKF 525A pretreatment, the possibility that altered protein binding may influence the findings should be considered.\r"

A model was developed which predicted the area under the S-fenoprofen plasma concentration-time curve after bolus administration of racemic fenoprofen. The mean (S.E.M.) predicted area, 2.1 (0.2) mg X min/ml/kg, was within 94% of the observed area 2.2 (0.2) mg X min/ml/kg. The effect of phenobarbital on the disposition of fenoprofen enantiomers was examined in an additional eight rabbits. During the control study the glucuronidation of R-fenoprofen exceeded the corresponding clearance term for the S-enantiomer by 2.1-fold. The clearances of individual enantiomers to their respective glucuronides increased after phenobarbital pretreatment by a mean 1.6-fold for R- and 2.3-fold for S-fenoprofen. The clearance of S-fenoprofen by processes other than glucuronidation and elimination of unchanged drug in urine was increased by a mean of 2.1-fold after phenobarbital pretreatment but the fractional inversion and the inversion clearance of R- to S-fenoprofen were not affected. These data indicate that on racemic fenoprofen administration the area under the curve for the pharmacologically active S-enantiomer would be reduced by phenobarbital pretreatment.\r"

The mean distribution volumes for R- and S-ketoprofen were 114 (7.4) and 294 (76) ml/kg, respectively. The mean clearance of the R-enantiomer from plasma was 292 (40) ml/kg/hr compared to 36 (3.2) ml/kg/hr for the S-enantiomer. This high degree of enantioselectivity was not due to inversion, renal clearance or clearance by glucuronidation, but was the result of an unknown clearance process(es). Comparing the mean parameters of ketoprofen disposition in renal dysfunction with those in the same animals during the control study, the mean fraction of the R-dose inverted increased by 290%, but this effect was not due to decreased clearance of R-ketoprofen renally or by glucuronidation. The distribution volumes of R- and S-ketoprofen were increased by 200 and 183% by renal dysfunction, consistent with an implied decrease in plasma protein binding. The clearances of bound plus unbound R- and S-ketoprofen from plasma remained unaltered by renal dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The use of spironolactone, the most commonly used antimineralocorticoid compound, is limited by the occurrence of sexual endocrine effects. New antagonists are therefore required which lack these unwanted effects. Three 9 alpha,11 alpha-epoxy-derivatives of known aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, prorenone and mexrenone) have been characterised in vitro and in vivo. In each experiment spironolactone was run as a reference. The introduction of the epoxy-group only marginally affected the binding affinity of these compounds for the mineralocorticoid receptor, whereas it caused a decrease for the androgen and progesterone receptors of between 10- and 500-fold. In vivo, all three epoxy-derivatives (3 mg/kg) were potent aldosterone antagonists, 1 to 2 times the potency of spironolactone in the rat. Parallel to the decreased affinity for the androgen and progesterone receptor in vitro, there was a 3- to 10-fold decrease of the antiandrogenic and progestagenic effect compared to spironolactone in the rat and in the rabbit, respectively. Virtually no disturbance of the vaginal or ovulatory cycle was observed with either epoxymexrenone or epoxyprorenone, although epoxyspironolactone caused a 20% decrease in ovulation. It appears therefore that the 9 alpha, 11 alpha-position of the steroid structure is a site of the molecule which can be modified to improve the specificity of aldosterone-antagonists not only in vitro, but also in vivo.\r"

Single ventricular cells were prepared by the collagenase dispersion procedure. Both OPC-8212 (0.1 mM) and IBMX (0.1 mM) augmented the plateau and increased the duration of the action potential without affecting the resting membrane potential. Under voltage clamp condition, OPC-8212 (0.1 mM) increased the inward calcium current and decreased the delayed outward and the inward-rectifying potassium current. IBMX (0.1 mM) increased not only the inward calcium but also the delayed outward current. The isolated inward calcium current obtained by intra- and extracellular perfusion with Cs+, was increased by both drugs. When the inward calcium current was abolished by superfusion with D600 (10 microM) or Co++ (0.9 mM), OPC-8212 (0.1 mM) decreased the delayed outward and the inward-rectifying potassium current. On the other hand, IBMX (0.1 mM) increased the delayed outward current. From these results it can be concluded that OPC-8212 augments the plateau and increases duration of the action potential not only by increasing the inward calcium but also by decreasing both the delayed outward and the inward-rectifying potassium current, and the effects can be a cause of the positive inotropic effect of this drug.\r"

In spite of an increase in protein binding of 560% for d-tubocurarine and 380% for N-methyldeptropine, perfusate clearance of both drugs in isolated perfused rat livers was not influenced by addition of 75 mg of ASOR. Absence of coendocytosis was indicated by subcellular distribution studies revealing no extra enrichment of quaternary ammonium drugs in lysosomal fractions compared with control studies. Isolation of parenchymal and sinusoidal liver cells demonstrated d-tubocurarine to be present solely in hepatocytes; binding to ASOR did not affect the relative distribution in the various cell types. It is concluded that binding of cationic drugs to ASOR does not result in endocytosis of a drug-protein-receptor complex by the liver. This result rather suggests that dissociation of the organic cations from the asialoglycoprotein occurs within the liver before endocytosis of the glycoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the abilities of three pharmacologically and structurally dissimilar 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2) antagonists, cyproheptadine, ketanserin, and mianserin, to interrupt cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) in stenosed coronary arteries of open-chest dogs. All three drugs decreased the frequency and severity of CFRs, but differed in the doses required for total abolition. Cyproheptadine and ketanserin both reduced by approximately 50% the frequency of CFRs at 10 micrograms/kg i.v. Mianserin appeared to be less potent; an approximately 50% reduction of the frequency of CFRs required 100 micrograms/kg. These in vivo results correlated well with their abilities to inhibit epinephrine plus 5-HT-induced aggregation of canine platelet-rich plasma in vitro. The IC50 values for inhibition of aggregation stimulated by this combination of agonists were 2.21, 2.84 and 7.38 microM, respectively. Ketanserin also inhibited amplification by 5-HT of ADP-induced aggregation of canine platelets much more potently than mianserin (IC50 = 0.07 vs. 3.18 microM). Mianserin and RX 781094, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited epinephrine-stimulated aggregation of human platelets more potently than ketanserin (IC50 values = 6.10, 0.19 and greater than 10 microM, respectively). Thus, the abilities of three 5-HT2 antagonists with diverse chemical structures and pharmacologic profiles (5-HT2 antagonism notwithstanding) to abolish CFRs suggests that amplification by 5-HT of other mediators, e.g. epinephrine and/or ADP, influences coronary blood flow importantly in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Much controversy surrounds the actions of nicotine on mammalian central neurons, especially with respect to the question of presence of multiple nicotine receptors and with respect to similarities of responses to those induced by acetylcholine (ACh). To resolve some of these complexities, the authors determined the effects of pressure-ejected nicotine on identified neurons in the cerebellar cortex of Sprague-Dawley rats under urethane anesthesia. Purkinje cells and interneurons were identified by their anatomical localization, discharge characteristics and responses to electrical stimulation of superficial parallel fibers. Locally applied nicotine altered single-unit activity in a manner strictly dependent on cell type. Pressure-ejected nicotine inhibited Purkinje cells (50/51) and excited cerebellar interneurons (22/22). The effects of nicotine on cell discharge rate were probably receptor mediated because \"classical\" nondepolarizing nicotinic antagonists selectively blocked the agonistic actions of nicotine. A curare-sensitive site (neuromuscular type) was found to mediate the excitatory effects of nicotine, and a hexamethonium-sensitive site (ganglionic type) was found to mediate the inhibitory effects of nicotine. ACh mimicked the effects of nicotine on both cell classes although muscarinic interactions were also observed. The inhibitory effects of ACh on Purkinje cells were antagonized by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium only if muscarinic receptors were simultaneously blocked via systemic administration of scopolamine. The excitatory effects of ACh on interneurons, on the other hand, were antagonized by the neuromuscular blocker curare even in the absence of a muscarinic antagonist. No interactions of curare and hexamethonium were observed with the amino acid transmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (Purkinje cells) and glutamate (interneurons).\r"

  ".U": "87112425\r", 
  ".W": "The major advantage of the argon laser in laparoscopic reproductive pelvic surgery is the ability to transmit the laser beam along a flexible fiber that can easily be directed at a lesion. Its use has been specifically described for the treatment of endometriosis because the absorption of the argon laser beam (488 + 514 nm) coincides with the pigmented endometriotic implants. It has been suggested that the argon laser would not be as useful in other infertility procedures because the lack of such pigmentation would reduce the lesion's absorption of the laser beam and therefore decrease the laser's efficacy of destruction. The argon laser was used in other kinds of reproductive pelvic surgery in 15 patients over seven months. Procedures performed laparoscopically with the laser were neosalpingostomy, fimbrioplasty, salpingo-oophorolysis, adhesiolysis and ablation of the uterosacral ligaments. Of six patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of pelvic pain, five reported complete resolution of the pain following therapy. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. In the short follow-up period, none of the patients conceived. In addition to its use in the treatment of endometriosis, the argon laser, transmitted laparoscopically via a fiber, can be safely used to perform a wide variety of other reproductive pelvic surgical procedures. Its relative efficiency with regard to these procedures, the subsequent pregnancy rates and the laser's ability to ameliorate pelvic pain remain to be established.\r"

Four weeks after receiving a standard injury, all the animals were killed and the adhesions scored blindly. Both the oral and intramuscular ibuprofen groups had significantly less severe adhesion formation (P less than .01) when compared to the control group. Although 32% dextran 70 alone showed no beneficial effect in reducing adhesions, the combination of oral ibuprofen and 32% dextran 70 had the least adhesion formation (P less than .002) when compared to the control group. Oral and intramuscular ibuprofen seem to be equally efficient in reducing postoperative adhesions. Furthermore, the combination of oral ibuprofen and 32% dextran 70 appears to have a synergistic effect.\r"

Questionnaires were collected from 492 women, who had ranged from 17 to 46 years of age at the time of sterilization. The majority of the women were married, and their average number of children was two. Of 487 women who replied, 30% did not receive any presterilization counseling from a physician; 15% of 480 women received their counseling from a nurse. Of 487 women, 2% fully regretted their sterilization, and the majority of them wanted more children. A positive correlation was found between the degree of satisfaction with presterilization counseling and the level of contentment with being sterilized. It was also found that 6 of the 53 women who were under 25 years of age at the time of surgery fully regretted their sterilization. The ethnic backgrounds of the women and their number of children at the time of surgery had no significant effect on their contentment with sterilization.\r"

Two of three patients beyond 20 weeks required tocolytic therapy for apparent premature labor. Dermoid cysts and torsion of a corpus luteum cyst were the most common pathologic findings. The type of incision employed was based on uterine size and expected location of the adnexal pathology. It appears that the risk to the pregnant patient undergoing adnexal surgery can be minimized with judicious timing of the operation, preoperative incision planning and modern anesthetic techniques. The use of prophylactic progesterone is unproven, and further studies of this therapeutic modality should be undertaken.\r"

The ethical problem of whether to provide treatment when the probability of success is low is sometimes complicated by a couple's desperate desire for fertility. In such cases the physician weighs various factors, including the risks of the procedure, the harm that might result from continuing infertility and the degree of the couple's understanding of the pros and cons. Issues of truth telling are raised by a lack of third-party reimbursement for infertility workup and treatment. Also, questions about when to refer or terminate the workup and therapy involve ethical reflection about potential conflicts of interest.\r"

One patient with a grossly positive DPL had a negative exploratory laparotomy (3.4% false positive rate). All 109 patients with negative DPL were admitted. In only one case a significant intra-abdominal injury was demonstrated (0.9% false negative rate). The overall mortality in this series was 11.6% and there were no complications related to the DPL. Our results suggest that DPL is indeed an accurate indicator of significant intra-abdominal injuries in patients with blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

After placement of an epidural balloon, intracranial pressure was increased to 30 mm Hg for 5 minutes and then permitted to vary without further manipulation. Hemorrhagic shock was produced by the rapid removal of blood to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 55 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Resuscitation then was performed with intravenous lactated Ringer's solution, 60 ml/kg, or with 6.0% hetastarch, 20 ml/kg. Following both solutions mean arterial pressure and cardiac output were increased and hemoglobin concentration was reduced. Intracranial pressure was significantly lower immediately after resuscitation in the hetastarch group; it then gradually increased so that the difference was much less 1 hour later. Cerebral blood flow decreased during shock and was not restored by either fluid; cerebral oxygen transport fell further with resuscitation in both groups due to hemodilutional reductions in hemoglobin. Although colloid resuscitation improved systemic hemodynamics and maintained lower intracranial pressure, it failed, as did crystalloid resuscitation, to restore cerebral oxygen transport to prehemorrhagic shock levels.\r"

The chance for a successful outcome influences the decision to initiate resuscitation and depends on the mode of injury, anatomic location of the wound, and elapsed time until presentation as well as the organization of the available facilities and personnel. The resuscitative algorithm for presumed exsanguination is markedly different from the ACLS guidelines for cardiogenic arrest and requires some degree of surgical expertise. After confirming the witnessed cardiopulmonary arrest from presumed exsanguination, the four phases of resuscitation are restoring central oxygenation, controlling internal hemorrhage, re-establishing spontaneous cardiac function, and definitively repairing the injury. Regardless of the type or location of the noncranial penetrating injury, these phases must be accomplished sequentially to minimize the risks of cerebral and cardiac anoxia.\r"

Survival was significantly greater after replacement of 25% of the shed blood with 7.5%, but not with 0.9%, 5.0%, or 10.0% sodium chloride solution. The mechanism appears to be by increased tissue perfusion as indicated by lower lactate values.

Ninety minutes after the ingestion of alcohol or saline, the animals were subjected to a standardized soft-tissue trauma. Cardiac output decreased significantly 2 minutes after trauma and remained low in both groups throughout the observation period of 30 minutes. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly increased in the alcohol-pretreated group but was virtually unchanged in the control animals. Systemic vascular resistance was similarly reduced in the two groups. Total compliance was somewhat lower in alcohol-pretreated animals and 10 minutes after the trauma arterial oxygen tension was significantly lower in the alcohol group than in control animals. Carbon dioxide elimination was reduced after trauma in both groups. It is concluded that pulmonary vascular response increased and that total pulmonary compliance is somewhat decreased shortly after trauma in the alcohol group while gas exchange is almost unchanged. The results indicate a negative interaction between alcohol and trauma.\r"

We screened the records of such an institution and studied the course and outcome of 434 human bite wounds and 803 lacerations in the same group of clients. Infection developed in 13.4% of the lacerations, and 17.7% of the bite wounds (chi 2 = 3.474; p greater than 0.06). Prophylactic antibiotics were administered after 14.0% of the bite wounds, and 3.2% of the lacerations. Infection supervened after prophylactic antibiotics in 29.5% of the bites and 34.6% of the lacerations. No patient with a bite wound required debridement, initial or subsequent surgical intervention other than wound closure, admission to hospital, or intravenous antibiotics. There is no recorded instance of a bite wound complication other than immediate loss of tissue. These data substantiate a higher incidence of infection in human bite wounds, but they are scant support for admonition that such wounds are indication for routine antimicrobial prophylaxis or aggressive surgical intervention.\r"

The remaining six patients, each with bone sequestra at the fracture site, underwent nail removal, debridement of nonviable bone, and external fixation followed by bone grafting; this group took 37 months to heal. There was one persistent nonunion in each group. Drainage did not cease in either group until the nail and all sequestra had been removed. There was an average of 4.3 cm of shortening, but no angulation greater than 10 degrees. Six patients were left with less than 45 degrees of knee flexion and only five had 100 degrees or more of knee flexion.\r"

Data were obtained from a hospital monitoring system established in nine emergency room facilities in a single county in California. The analysis indicates that in some cases injured seatbelted children were injured in circumstances in which the seatbelt could not have been protective, e.g., vehicle deformation into the child, flying glass, etc. The analysis of the remaining cases of seatbelted children suggests that there are significant variations in mechanisms of injury as well as injury patterns for different aged children. In many of the cases of injury observed in this sample, even though the child had been restrained in the adult seatbelt, the anatomic characteristics of the child prevented optional protection. The research provides further evidence for the necessity for utilizing specially designed restraints for children at least up to the age of 10 years.\r"

To evaluate the predictive value of fever as an indicator of infection in burned children, we reviewed the hospital charts of all 223 children admitted to a regional burn center in the years 1979 through 1982. The highest temperature reading for each 8-hour period of the child's hospitalization was recorded. The highest mean temperature in burned children occurred at 38 to 96 hours after the burn injury; the peak temperatures appeared at the same time, regardless of whether the child had an infection. All of the 23 children with infections (100%) and 145 of the 200 without infections (73%) had a recorded temperature reading of 38.2 degrees C or higher within 2 weeks after their burn injury. When children less than 4 years, or children with more than 20% total body surface area burns were considered alone, the presence of a temperature greater than 38.2 degrees C was not significant in differentiating those with infections. Fever is not a specific predictor of infection in burned children; in children less than 4 years of age and in children with more than 20% burns, fever has no predictive value for the presence of infection. The physical examination is a reliable source of information about wound infection, sepsis, or other childhood infections, and should be the primary tool used in making the diagnosis of infection in burned children.\r"

Possible factors increasing the risk of secondary fracture included loosening of the prosthesis (eight cases), osteoporosis (14 cases), varus angulation of the femoral stem (28 cases), calcar resorption (nine cases), major capsular calcifications (four cases), and cortical defects at the tip of the stem (three cases). The importance of correct insertion of the prostheses is emphasized. The degree of mobilization after fracture healing was overall reduced and most pronounced with increasing age and not correlated to treatment. The earliest mobilization was obtained in patients treated with long-stem prostheses supplemented with internal fixation, and this method of treatment is advocated.\r"

Compared to those addicts who obtained more sustained treatment, the addicts who were only detoxified had fewer psychological problems and were more often male, black and younger. These baseline differences complicated comparisons between these minimally treated addicts and the rest, but among those who had more than minimal treatment, continuous treatment was better than intermittent treatment in controlling substance abuse and legal problems. Further analyses involved dividing the 30 months of follow-up into 6 month blocks and comparing the 6 months before, during and after leaving or reentering treatment. We found that addicts left treatment at periods of relative abstinence and good psychosocial adjustment, although they increased their alcohol abuse during the period of leaving treatment. During the 6 months after leaving, patients often returned to drug abuse and then rapidly deteriorated in social adjustment. When reentering treatment, the majority (75%) stayed for over 6 months and improved steadily in most areas. At reentry patients also had less criminal activity, less physical disability, and less opiate use suggesting a carry-over of treatment benefits, but they had more problems with their spouse and more alcohol and cocaine use than they had when first entering treatment suggesting new precipitants for reentry into treatment.\r"

The elimination of alcohol and drugs through chemical-dependency treatment, therefore, might be expected to precipitate an exacerbation of stress symptoms and predispose veterans to new cycles of abuse. The relationship between combat and post-treatment substance abuse has not been subjected to empirical study. This paper examines treatment-completion and post-treatment abstinence rates (treatment efficacy) as a function of level of combat when combat veterans are provided trauma-oriented therapy concurrently with treatment for chemical dependency. The experimental results suggest that, under these conditions, treatment efficacy does not vary with level of combat. The absence of combat-level effects is explained in terms of the interactive dynamics of chemical-dependency and post-traumatic stress disorder.\r"

We have recently treated 959 opioid addicts with LAAM for periods up to 36 consecutive months. Three times per week dosing of LAAM proved to be a safe and effective treatment agent for the majority of subjects. During LAAM induction there is a delay in opioid activity as LAAM forms its long-acting metabolites, therefore, symptomatic withdrawal medication must usually be administered during the first 96 hours of treatment to adequately suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and prevent self-administration of drugs by the patient. No long-term hepatic toxicity or tumor formation could be demonstrated by liver function studies and liver-spleen imaging in a subgroup of patients. Some opioid addicts report that they prefer LAAM over methadone, but the reverse was reported by about 40% of our patients which suggests that both drugs are needed for adequate maintenance treatment of the opioid-addicted population.\r"

Data were obtained from on-site confidential interviews with the entire treatment staff at seven programs. It was found that there were marked differences in the number and type of medical staff. Thus, there was ten times more coverage by physicians at some programs than others. In general, there were notable differences in the treatment staff available. Comparable variations among the programs were found with respect to the actual provision of medical services. Thus, the number of patients seen by the medical staff on a weekly basis varied from a high of 185 patients to a low of 36 patients. Similarly, the proportion of each program's patients receiving medical treatment per week varied from 53 to 14 percent. Reasons for those variations in medical services are considered.\r"

A crucial and much misunderstood aspect of the management role, especially at the agency level, is the dimension of power or the management of organizational politics.

A urethral catheter was inserted and clamped during computerized tomography to ensure bladder filling. Of our first 2 patients computerized tomography showed no evidence of opacified urinary extravasation in 1 and only subtle evidence in the other. Cystography revealed gross intraperitoneal extravasation of opacified urine in both patients. Presently, retrograde cystography, including a film of the distended bladder and a drainage film, remains the most reliable test in suspected bladder rupture.\r"

The risk-to-benefit ratio at entry into bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy (7 per cent risk of invasive cancer developing, 5 per cent risk of metastases and 77 per cent prospect for status free of tumor) and in patients who had failed only 1 course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy (11 per cent invasive cancer, 14 per cent metastases and 58 per cent free of tumor) were highly favorable. However, among patients who had failed 2 or more courses of bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy the risks of invasive (30 per cent) or metastatic (50 per cent) cancer developing exceeded the prospects for eradicating the superficial tumor present (20 per cent) with further therapy.

One type included bladder instability with powerful voiding contractions of the bladder and reflux that frequently occurred on 1 side only. Reflux nephropathy or the presence of an upper urinary tract abnormality is rare. In the other type the bladder contracted poorly during voiding and overactivity of the urethral closure mechanism often was observed. The bladder usually was stable and the reflux occurred frequently on both sides. Reflux nephropathy or the presence of an upper urinary tract abnormality is relatively common. Direct videourodynamic observations of reflux in a second group of children confirmed the existence of these 2 types of reflux/dysfunction complexes.\r"

The application of force to a balloon catheter placed at that part of the bladder regularly results in an urge to urinate. People with normal voiding perceive the urge to void when 245 +/- 47 gm. (standard deviation) of force are applied. Patients with irritative symptoms (urinary frequency and urgency) perceive the urge to void when 132 +/- 50 gm. (p equals 0.0003) are applied. After enucleative prostatectomy more force is required to cause the urge to void (344 +/- 48 gm., p equals 0.0003) and even more force is required after radical prostatectomy (469 +/- 54 gm., p equals 0.0002). Patients with acute urinary retention or urinary stress incontinence were not distinguishable from the normal group. Patients with chronic urinary retention may be divided into 2 subgroups: 1 with normal sensory perception and 1 with reduced perception (526 +/- 32 gm., p equals 1.6 X 10(-9)). Three patients with urinary urgency not associated with frequency did not perceive the urge to void until 541 +/- 21 gm. (p equals 6.2 X 10(-7)) had been applied. Some elderly patients could not reproducibly report the urge to void. When lidocaine was applied topically within the bladder sensitivity was reduced by 210 +/- 114 gm. (p equals 0.003). It is suggested that pressure sensitive receptors in the mucosa or submucosa of the bladder base and posterior urethra have a role in micturition, that their activity can be quantitated and that protocols designed to manage them may have impact on the care of patients with voiding disorders.\r"

Testing of the new electrode with simultaneous registration of external anal sphincter electromyography using a coaxial needle electrode showed synchronous electromyographic patterns. In clinical urodynamic studies, including 48 cystometry studies with anal sphincter electromyography and 48 pressure-flow electromyographic studies, the electrode provided technically good and reliable electromyograms. The electrode design secures good contact to the recording surface and a safe fixation of the electrode during recording. The compressibility of the electrode might circumvent the problem of possible detrusor reflex inhibition induced by conventional hard anal plug electrodes. We recommend this technique for anal sphincter electromyography, since it is simple, reliable and without discomfort, and it does not require sterilization of the electrode.\r"

Because a high percentage of spinal cord injury patients with total ischiectomy had complications of the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra, we evaluated urodynamically 15 ischiectomy patients in the supine and sitting positions to determine if pressure usually borne by the ischial tuberosities was transmitted to the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra. Of the 8 patients with a complete ischiectomy at least on 1 side 5 had problems of the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra, and the average urethral pressure increase from the reclining to the sitting position was 111 cm. water. The increase in urethral pressure was not related to any change in bladder or abdominal pressure. The average urethral pressure increase in the nonischiectomy patients was only 16 cm. water and none had any problems of the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra. Some retrospective clinical studies have implicated ischiectomy in the development of these urethral complications. Our urodynamic data lend some direct evidence that a more complete ischiectomy results in excessive urethral pressure with the patient in the sitting position, thereby predisposing the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra to problems related to ischemia. Five of the 8 patients with more complete ischiectomy and 1 with bilateral partial ischiectomy had high urethral pressures and complications, such as pseudodiverticulum, diverticulum and dilatation. More incomplete ischiectomy should be used to obviate this urethral damage.\r"

  ".W": "The staged functional closure of classical bladder exstrophy has produced improved results for many urologists involved in the surgical management of this congenital anomaly. To determine which factors are most important for achieving a successful outcome (urinary continence with preservation of normal renal function) the 144 patients treated at The Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1975 and 1985 were reviewed. Of these patients 51 were managed entirely at our institution, while 93 had had the initial surgical treatment elsewhere. All patients who had undergone primary bladder closure and bladder neck reconstruction were divided into 2 groups: group 1--patients who had a successful initial bladder closure (an exstrophied bladder that is converted into a complete epispadias without wound infection, dehiscence or any degree of bladder prolapse on the first attempt) and group 2--children whose initial bladder closure was not successful. Both groups were analyzed with respect to bladder capacity at the time of bladder neck reconstruction, time required for the bladder to become sufficiently large for bladder neck reconstruction, urinary continence rate, and interval between bladder neck reconstruction and achievement of urinary continence. Patients in group 1 had the largest bladders at the time of bladder neck reconstruction (mean capacity 79 cc, p equals 0.03), shortest intervals between primary closure and bladder neck reconstruction (mean 3.5 years, p equals 0.006), highest urinary continence rate (92 per cent, p equals 0.002), and the shortest interval between bladder neck reconstruction and achievement of urinary continence (mean 1.5 years, p equals 0.18). These findings suggest that a successful initial bladder closure is an important factor for obtaining a larger bladder more quickly and for achieving a high urinary continence rate in patients with classical bladder exstrophy undergoing the staged functional bladder closure.\r"

We describe a closed controlled method of posterior urethral reconstruction following traumatic avulsion of the posterior urethra. Urethral continuity was re-established by endoscopic identification of the true prostatic outlet, its fixation with an angiography wire and a Goodwin sound, retrograde visual urethrotomy through the fibrotic segment and balloon dilation of the entire posterior channel. Postoperative anatomical and functional results were excellent, and were achieved with much less risk and cost to the patient than those of a perineal or transpubic urethroplasty.\r"

Cell lines with more aberrant karyotypes, such as UM-UC-3 (modal chromosome number 86, 12 marker chromosomes) and UM-UC-4 (modal number 51, ten marker chromosomes) show fewer ribosomal DNA length variants (7.6, 6.7 kilobases for the former, 7.6 kilobases for the latter), consistent with relaxed constraints on the drive for ribosomal gene homogeneity through inter and intrachromosomal exchange. Uncharacterized rDNA length variants of low copy number were observed in cell lines with many marker chromosomes. Analysis of repetitive DNA structure provides an additional criterion for tumor diagnosis and staging, and a characterized series of tumor cell lines may provide a useful system for understanding repetitive DNA evolution.\r"

In order to identify histopathologic and ultrastructural correlates of these observations, R3327AT-3 prostatic tumor cells were exposed to HESW in vitro and in vivo. Damage to cells in suspension was manifested by fragmentation of cells to form debris. At the ultrastructural level, mitochondria were swollen and contained distorted cristae following exposure of tumor cells to HESW. In vivo exposure of tumor nodules to HESW did not cause a distinct histopathologic or ultrastructural effect that could be qualitatively distinguished from spontaneously occurring cell death. Hemorrhage and necrosis were observed in muscle and fibroadipose tissue adjacent to tumor. The mechanism of HESW-induced cytotoxicity is not clear from our studies. Evidence of damage of normal tissues exposed in vivo and tumor cells in vitro is reflected in histomorphological changes.\r"

In bladder stones composed of calcium oxalate, uric acid and ammonium acid urate, 73 Gla residues per 1,000 amino acid residues were detected. Bladder stones composed of calcium oxalate, uric acid, ammonium acid urate, and hydroxyapatite contained 48 Gla residues per 1,000 amino acid residues present. No Gla was detected in the predominantly magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) bladder stones. These results with human bladder stones from children under 10 years of age are consistent with the observations from adult patients in which Gla was detected in the calcium-containing renal calculi but not in the non-calcium-containing renal calculi.

  ".W": "Adriamycin was conjugated to an IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human prostatic acid phosphatase via a dextran bridge. The adriamycin-monoclonal antibody conjugate retained substantially the original immunological activity of the antibody. Antitumor effect of the conjugate in vitro was studied by its inhibition on RNA synthesis in human prostate tumor cells (LNCaP), which exhibited a higher inhibition than that by an identically prepared adriamycin-normal mouse IgG conjugate but was less than that by free adriamycin. The loss in pharmacological activity of the conjugate in vitro was proportional to the extent of dextran oxidation. Antitumor effect in vivo demonstrated that adriamycin-monoclonal antibody conjugate greatly inhibited the growth of xenografted prostate tumor, as compared with control groups, only in the early phase of experiment. These results suggested that although adriamycin conjugated to monoclonal anti-PAP antibody via a dextran bridge may be a potential reagent for experimental immunochemotherapy of prostate tumor, caution must be exercised at this stage of development.\r"

  ".W": "Intravesical immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Corynebacterium parvum (CP), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and an extract of Allium sativum (AS) was studied in mice transplanted intravesically with mouse bladder tumor cells (MBT-2). Female C3H/He mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Two X 10(5) MBT-2 cells were delivered into the bladder transurethrally using a small catheter, immediately after the posterior wall of the bladder had been electrocauterized. Bladder tumor became palpable or demonstrable microscopically in two weeks. Immunotherapy with BCG (2 X 10(6) CFU), CP (250 micrograms), KLH (50 micrograms), or AS (25 mg) was administered directly into the bladder via urethral catheter on day 1, day 6, or days 1 and 6. On day 21 the bladders and spleens were excised and weighed, and the bladders were examined macroscopically and microscopically for evidence of tumor. The results of the study showed that two treatments given one and six days after tumor transplant yielded the lowest tumor incidence and that CP and AS appeared equally effective or even slightly more effective than BCG in this model. These results suggest that clinical evaluation of CP or AS may be worthwhile.\r"

Cases were 433 women aged 20 to 54 years with histologically confirmed epithelial endometrial cancer ascertained through six population-based cancer registries. Controls were 3191 women selected at random from the populations of these areas. Women who had used combination OCs for at least 12 months had an age-adjusted risk of developing endometrial cancer of 0.6 relative to those women who had never used OCs (95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.9). This protective effect persisted for at least 15 years after the cessation of OC use. Examination of the eight most frequently used OC formulations revealed little difference in the age-adjusted risks, which ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 for women who had ever used a formulation compared with women who had never used OCs. Use of OCs for 12 months or longer conferred protection against all three major histologic subtypes of endometrial cancer.\r"

The tables permit computation of a \"probability of causation\" (otherwise known as \"assigned share\") that an individual's cancer was caused by earlier estimated exposure to radiation. However, several limitations have been noted in the accuracy of the computations and in the conditions under which the computations are applicable. These limitations have caused the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association to recommend that the probability of causation approach not be applied to occupational radiation exposures or to diagnostic or therapeutic exposures in medicine.\r"

This article discusses the results of the subsequent study and focuses only on medical discipline issues. We found that the rate of disciplinary actions taken by boards has been increasing. However, revocations and suspensions, the most serious category of actions, have remained relatively constant. Additionally, consumers and law enforcement agencies are the most active sources of possible violations. Individual health care professionals, hospitals, peer review organizations, and medical societies provide strikingly few reports. To rectify these problems, we encourage states to increase physician license renewal fees to fund expansion and improvement of boards' enforcement activities and to consider ways to limit the legal liability of those making good-faith referrals.\r"

This finding was explored in the large cohort (361,662) of men aged 35 to 57 years who were screened for possible randomization to the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Mortality follow-up revealed a significant excess of cancer in the lowest decile of serum cholesterol level during the early years of follow-up, which attenuated over time. In contrast, the association between high serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease did not diminish during the average of seven years of follow-up. These findings are consistent with the inference that the association between low serum cholesterol level and cancer is at least in part due to an effect of preclinical cancer on serum cholesterol level. A subset of the cohort (12,866 men) participated in the randomized Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial protocol, which called for annual measurements of serum cholesterol level. Among the 150 of these men who died of cancer during the trial, cholesterol level fell 22.7 mg/dL (0.59 mmol/L) more than in the survivors over an equivalent period. These data are consistent with the foregoing inference.\r"

  ".W": "From 1965 to 1968, the Honolulu Heart Program began following up a cohort of men in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease. For this report, we examined the 12-year risk of stroke in 690 diabetic and 6908 nondiabetic subjects free of coronary heart disease and a history of stroke at study entry. In 12 years of follow-up, 62.3 per 1000 diabetic men and 32.7 per 1000 nondiabetic men experienced a stroke. The relative risk of thromboembolic stroke for those with diabetes compared with those without diabetes was 2.0 (95% confidence limits, 1.4 to 3.0). Although diabetes was usually associated with an atherogenic risk profile, control of hypertension, complicating myocardial infarction, and other risk factors failed to diminish the effect of diabetes on stroke. Among those without diabetes, the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke for those at the 80th percentile of serum glucose level compared with those at the 20th percentile (199 vs 115 mg/dL [11.0 vs 6.4 mmol/L]) was 1.4 (95% confidence limits, 1.1 to 1.8). In the nondiabetic sample, the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke for those with glucosuria compared with those without glucosuria was 2.7 (95% confidence limits, 1.6 to 4.5). There was no association between diabetes, or measures of glucose intolerance, and hemorrhagic stroke. We conclude that diabetes, even in a possibly undiagnosed subset of hyperglycemic individuals, imparts an additional independent risk of stroke unexplained by clinically measured risk factors.\r"

The technique employs measurement with a computer-linked gamma camera of the activity ratio in an area of the right lung compared with the same-sized area in the heart at 20 minutes and three hours following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m albumin. We applied this measurement to three groups of patients: a control group and patients with roentgenographic evidence of edema classified according to clinically available criteria as either hydrostatic edema or permeability edema to see if we could document differences among these groups. In control patients this ratio did not increase by more than seven units between the 20-minute and three-hour measurements. Of 18 patients classified by other routine clinical means as having hydrostatic pulmonary edema, 89% showed no increase in lung albumin accumulation. In 29 patients with permeability edema associated with the so-called adult respiratory distress syndrome, 31% showed evidence of net pulmonary albumin accumulation. These findings suggest that some patients otherwise classified as having hydrostatic edema have concomitant permeability changes in the microvasculature and that permeability edema represents a spectrum of endothelial damage.\r"

In separate studies, cocaine was given to the ewe or fetus as a 0.5-, 1.0-, or 2.0-mg/kg intravenous bolus, and cardiovascular and arterial blood gas values were obtained for 60 minutes after the injection. The results showed that maternal administration of cocaine produced dose-dependent increases in maternal blood pressure and decreases in uterine blood flow. Uterine vascular resistance increased by 52%, 96%, and 168%, respectively. These responses were accompanied by marked fetal hypoxemia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Direct cocaine administration to the fetus produced smaller increases in fetal heart rate and blood pressure than those observed following maternal cocaine injection, and no significant changes in fetal arterial blood gas values. The conclusions are cocaine alters fetal oxygenation by reducing uterine blood flow and impairing oxygen transfer to the fetus; and fetal cardiovascular changes to maternal administration of cocaine may reflect fetal hypoxemia, increased fetal levels of cocaine or fetal catecholamines, or a combination of these events.\r"

Broad agreement exists in categorizing elder abuse as physical, psychological, and financial and/or material, despite lack of uniformity in definitions. Systematic scientific investigation provides limited knowledge about the causes of elder abuse. Most experts, however, believe that family problems and conflict are a major precipitating factor. Preliminary hypotheses for elder abuse include dependency, lack of close family ties, family violence, lack of financial resources, psychopathology in the abuser, lack of community support, and certain factors that may precipitate abuse in institutional settings. This report presents potential indicators of physical and psychological abuse, along with classification of elderly individuals at high risk, to assist the health professional in identification and prevention of elder abuse.\r"

During this time, an influenza outbreak was occurring in the state. Cultures of respiratory secretions were performed in eight patients; Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from all of them. Seven S aureus isolates were available for determination of exotoxin production; five isolates produced toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, one produced enterotoxin B, and one produced both. Acute influenza B infection was confirmed in three of four patients for whom throat cultures or acute and convalescent serum samples were available. Two patients fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control-confirmed case definition for TSS. Four additional patients fulfilled the CDC criteria for a probable case of TSS, and TSS was a likely diagnosis in the remaining three patients. The initial presentation was suggestive of nonsuppurative tracheitis or viral pneumonia in eight patients. In the remaining patient, the initial clinical presentation was compatible with staphylococcal pneumonia. This report demonstrates that TSS can occur as a complication of influenza and influenzalike illness.\r"

We studied the safety and efficacy of this newly approved route and dose of administration. Serologic results were available from 112 (90%) of the 124 persons who participated in an HDCV low-dose preexposure study in which five different ID, intramuscular (IM), and subcutaneous primary immunization regimens were administered. Three 1.0-mL IM doses of vaccine resulted in titers similar to those from three 0.1-mL ID doses when compared 49 days, one year, and two years after primary immunization. Uniformly high postbooster titers occurred in all five groups when ID boosters were administered at one year or two years. Adverse reactions were similar following both ID and IM vaccination. Although ID HDCV can be a cost-effective substitute for IM vaccine, excessive use of unnecessary preexposure booster doses by any route may be inadvisable because of systemic allergic reactions. In addition, poor immune responses to HDCV have been documented in persons vaccinated in some developing countries. This may limit the use of low-dose regimens in some places.\r"

Visual acuity in the surgical eye improved from a mean of 20/100 before surgery to 20/40 four months after surgery; improvement was maintained at one year. Positive changes occurred in some subjective measures of patient function, such as reported activities of daily living and patient report of vision-dependent activities, but these changes were modest. The most marked changes in patient function occurred in objective measures of function. Mental status had improved not quite significantly at four months but significantly at one year. Timed manual performance improved dramatically and significantly at four months and one year. Cataract surgery was associated with improved vision and improved objective function in most patients by four months after surgery, and these improvements were maintained at one year.\r"

Sixty-one women (mean age, 85.8 years) with bacteriuria were in the no therapy control group and 63 women (mean age, 85.8 years) with bacteriuria were in the therapy group; none had symptoms of urinary tract infection. One short course of antimicrobial therapy achieved a cure rate of 68.3% (43 of 63 women cured) two weeks after treatment. During the six-month follow-up period, ten (16.4%) of 61 women in the no therapy group and five (7.9%) of 63 women in the therapy group developed symptomatic urinary tract infection. At the time of six-month follow-up, 19 (34.5%) of 55 women in the no therapy group and 35 (63.6%) of 55 women in the therapy group did not have bacteriuria. We conclude that for asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory nonhospitalized women, short-course antimicrobial therapy is effective at two-week follow-up and that antimicrobial therapy can eliminate bacteriuria in most of these women for at least a six-month period.\r"

A representative sample of eight medical school FPPs in seven different communities was selected for study. For each FPP, a sample of health care leaders, stratified at different levels of administrative responsibility, was selected from academic medical centers and from community settings. Topics for FPP assessment were chosen for their relevance to physician and lay administrators involved with academic and community practice. Questions were answered on a yes-no basis and were graded by intensity of response. Although only two of the questions revealed statistical disparity on a simple yes-no basis, the intensity of response differed significantly in eight of the 14 questions asked. This study gives consideration to the strategic implications of FPPs for universities, medical schools, and organized medicine.\r"

In five patients, 0.5 mmol/min of MgSO4 was administered intravenously for 20 minutes, and the time courses of respiratory resistance, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume at 1 s were studied. In another five patients, MgSO4 dose-response curves were obtained. Soon after administration began, MgSO4 relieved bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum responses (mean +/- SE) of respiratory resistance, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume were 71% +/- 3%, 117% +/- 5%, and 118% +/- 1% of initial values, respectively, and were similar to the effects of additional albuterol inhalation. The infusion of MgSO4 also improved dyspnea and piping rales in three other asthmatic patients with a severe attack. We conclude that intravenous infusion of MgSO4 produces a rapid and marked bronchodilation in both mild and severe asthma and may be a unique bronchodilating agent.\r"

Both the donor serum and semen contained HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen, and the HBsAg subtype was identical to that of the patient. Documentation of hepatitis B virus transmission by artificial insemination indicates that HBsAg screening of semen donors should be routine practice.\r"

Another 27 patients (22.3%) developed iron deficiency one month to 14 years later (median, two years). It was impossible to predict such a development in these 27 patients from any of their initial findings. The cause of the iron deficiency was identified in 17 of the 52 iron-deficient patients and suspected in another four. These findings show that patients with pernicious anemia are at high risk for iron deficiency, both at initial presentation and subsequently. Although the cause of the iron deficiency is often not identifiable, clinically important entities are detected often enough to warrant routine investigation for iron deficiency in such patients.\r"

To study how physicians adapt to limited CCU beds, we compared their decisions to admit patients to the CCU when the CCU was full with those made when the CCU was not full. We studied 4479 patients who presented with symptoms suggesting acute cardiac ischemia to six New England hospital emergency rooms over 16 months. Of the 2931 patients found on follow-up not to have acute ischemia, 33% of those presenting when the CCU was not full were admitted to the CCU vs 24% of such patients presenting when the CCU was full (P = .0005), a 27% drop. Of the 725 patients proving to have angina pectoris, 74% of those presenting when the CCU was not full were admitted to the CCU vs 62% of such patients presenting when the CCU was full (P = .007), a 16% reduction. Of the 823 patients found to have myocardial infarction, 90% were admitted to the CCU both when the CCU was not full and when it was full. Importantly, for no group did mortality increase when the CCU was full. These data suggest that physicians can safely adapt to substantial reductions in the availability of CCU beds.\r"

  ".W": "At present, healthy potential blood donors older than the age of 66 years often leave the donor pool for reasons of age alone, despite the fact that this demographic group is growing, is a potentially willing source of blood products, and constitutes the cohort with highest per capita use of blood and its derivatives. There is no clinical or physiological rationale for this. We performed a controlled study to measure the feasibility and safety of blood donation by healthy elderly donors aged 66 years and older, compared with a younger cohort aged 55 to 65 years of age. A study group of prior donors aged 66 years and older and a control group of prior donors between the ages of 50 and 65 were sent letters inviting them to donate blood. The volume donated did not differ between the two groups. In the older group, there were eight immediate reactions, seven mild and one moderate. The control population experienced seven immediate reactions, six mild and one severe. We conclude that it is both clinically feasible and efficient to recruit healthy prior donors older than the age of 66 years for blood donation. As a group, this population is potentially able to donate large volumes of blood and do so without any difference in immediate or short-term reactions. Further study of hemodynamic variables as more objective markers of safety is needed.\r"

Mycoplasma hominis infection was also associated with postpartum endometritis, but only among women undergoing a cesarean section (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence intervals, 1.22 to 18.3). Although women with recent C trachomatis infection (IgM titer greater than 1:32 on either sample or IgG seroconversion) were at greater risk of low birth weight (19% [3/16]) than women with chronic infection (4.5% [6/133]; relative risk, 4.2), this subgroup at risk was small (11% of women with classifiable C trachomatis infection). Mycoplasma hominis and C trachomatis infections may be important preventable causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes in identifiable subgroups of women.\r"

We observed marked weight gain (median, 5.1 kg; range, 0.9 to 20.1 kg) and appetite enhancement in 27 of the 28 patients with breast cancer receiving treatment consisting of high doses of oral megestrol acetate (480 to 1600 mg/d). Weight gain occurred regardless of pretreatment weight, extent of metastases, or response to therapy. Our results suggest a possible role for megestrol acetate in reversing anorexia and weight loss, thereby improving the quality of life of patients with cachexia. Further research is needed to establish the mechanism of weight gain and potential clinical applications.\r"

Most of the blood components were stored frozen. The autologous units were later used in 1938 surgical procedures. Intraoperative blood salvage yielded 125,105 mL of blood with an average hematocrit of 80% (0.80), which was reinfused into 934 patients. Autologous blood components accounted for 95% of the transfusion requirements. Thus, the risks of homologous transfusions were avoided in the vast majority of the procedures. Ninety-one percent of the donors were older than 50 years of age and 8.4% were between 80 and 91 years of age. The large-scale use of autologous blood has been feasible, practical, and cost efficient, has contributed to the community's blood supply, and provides the patient with the safest blood available--his own blood.\r"

Much of this change in the use of computers in this field is due to the pressures of cost containment, DRG requirements, the availability of microcomputers, and the desire for improved health care. In the areas of clinical care, medical research, and medical education, the computer is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool through its technological adaptation. The computer is an obvious adjunct to the problem of improving cost efficiency without compromising the efforts toward better health care.\r"

Whether any other histologic features of GBA have prognostic significance is unknown. This investigation was conducted to determine if GBA histologic grade correlates with survival. Thirty patients with advanced stage GBA participating in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) treatment protocol EST-2273 served as the study material. Using glandular tumor grade criteria recommended by others, a panel of 7 ECOG pathologists categorized the GBA as either predominantly low or high histologic grade. Each patient's GBA histologic section measured no less than 1.0 X 1.0 cm. Predominant grade was defined as being that grade present in greater than 75% of the histologic section. Patient survival times by grade were calculated from date of initiation of chemotherapy until date of death. The 13-week low grade GBA patient survival was significantly longer than the 7-week high grade GBA patient survival (p less than 0.01). Stratification of patients by either high or low predominant histologic grade is recommended in future GBA treatment studies.\r"

A unilateral dissection was performed on 7 patients (14%), none of whom developed intraoperative or postoperative complications. The remaining 42 patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, after which 26 were treated with definitive radiation therapy using the four-field box technique, and 16 received other forms of therapy (delayed androgen deprivation or hormonal manipulation). The complication rate of 19% was identical for both groups of patients. Complications consisted of 3 seromas, 1 atelectasis, 1 prolonged ileus, 1 wound infection, and 2 transient penile or scrotal edemas. Radiation therapy, therefore, did not increase postoperative morbidity.\r"

IVC leiomyosarcomas spread by extension into adjacent tissue planes. Direct extension into the heart is known, but not into the kidneys, adrenals, or bowel. IVC leiomyosarcomas arising below the renal vein cause pain in the right-lower quadrant, back, and flank, and varying degrees of lower extremity edema; those arising in the middle caval segment cause right-upper-quadrant pain and sometimes renovascular hypertension; those arising above the hepatic vein cause varying manifestations of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. A reasonable approach to early diagnosis involves oral and intravenous contrast studies followed by computed tomography, angiography, and vena cavography. Aggressive surgical treatment is optimal in light of the tumor's slow growth pattern and relatively low malignant potential. (Metastases have been reported in fewer than 50% of cases). Tumors involving the lower IVC are most amenable to surgery; extensive collateral venous drainage of the left kidney preserves renal function during resection of middle caval tumors. Upper caval leiomyosarcomas are the least amenable to complete removal. Postoperative survival of all patients has ranged from a few weeks to eight years.\r"

However, in some selected cases due to failure of previous operations or complications of radiation and recurrence, the reconstructive surgeon is left with very little choice. The purpose of this paper is not to advocate the use of the shoulder flap as a primary reconstructive procedure, but to call attention to its availability for certain complicated cases and briefly described the details of the technique.\r"

However, HPD is less than ideal as an agent for tumor photoradiation therapy because it produces a period of photosensitivity that can last 30 days or more, and it can be toxic to surrounding tissues such as skin when used in the treatment of subcutaneous metastases. The usefulness of intraarterial injection for refining the selectivity of HPD was investigated in this work. Intraarterial administration of HPD was not found to provide higher tumor levels of HPD, nor was it able to increase significantly the concentration of HPD relative to surrounding tissues, such as skin and muscle. However, fluorescence microscopy findings suggested that some fluorescent HPD component is rapidly accumulated in tumor macrophages following intraarterial injection.\r"

The diagnosis of Merkle cell carcinoma was established only after the tumor had recurred locally and involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes.

  ".W": "A popular rule of thumb has often prevailed in treating oral cancer: Try one modality first; if it fails, try the other--the chance for cure will still be good. To study this dogma, a group of 160 consecutive patients with oral cavity squamous carcinoma were reviewed. A hypothesis was formed: secondary treatment for recurrent cancer, whether surgery after radiation failure or vice versa, would salvage essentially as many patients as primary treatment, say within 15%. Results show a large difference in success rates between first and second treatments when all stages are considered together, a difference well over 15 percentage points. Regarding each stage separately, the largest difference occurs in stage II (28 percentage points); other stages exceed 15 point differences. No significant differences in successful salvage occur between \"home\" failures and \"elsewhere\" failures. Local recurrence was a major cause of failure in both groups (55%). We conclude that recurrence of oral squamous cancer after first treatment markedly reduces patients' chance for cure.\r"

The protruded mass with central depression resembled a submucosal tumor, located on the posterior wall of a part of the cardia, fornix, and upper corpus. Histologically, submucosal ectopic glands composed of columnar cells, mucus-producing cells that closely resemble gastric epithelium, and ciliated epithelium were observed. The tumor consisted of an admixture of cuboidal, columnar cells, mucus-producing cells, singled or pseudostratified ciliated epithelium, and squamous metaplastic cells. The tumor cells were intimately continuous with the submucosal ectopic glands. Gradual transition between tumor cells and epithelium of submucosal ectopic glands was recognized. It is supposed that mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the stomach in this case derived from preexisting submucosal ectopic mucous glands of the stomach.\r"

Comparisons were made among five methods of myocardial protection: Group I, topical cooling; Group II, hyperosmolar (450 mOsm) low-calcium (0.5 mmol/L) crystalloid cardioplegia; Group III, St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia; Group IV, cold blood cardioplegia with potassium (21 mmol/L), citrate-phosphate-dextrose (calcium level 0.6 mmol/L), and tromethamine; and Group V, cold blood cardioplegia with potassium alone (16 mmol/L) (calcium level 1.2 mmol/L). Hemodynamic recovery (percent of the preischemic stroke work) after 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion was 82.9% and 86.7% in Group I, 35.7% (p less than 0.0001) and 43.7% (p less than 0.0001) in Group II, 76.1% and 77.7% in Group III, 67.4% (p less than 0.05) and 60.6% (p less than 0.05) in Group IV, and 110.7% and 100.6% in Group V. Conclusions: Topical cooling is an effective method of myocardial protection in the neonate. Cold blood cardioplegia with potassium alone and a normal calcium level provides optimal functional recovery. The improved protection obtained with both crystalloid and blood cardioplegia with normal calcium levels suggests an increased sensitivity of the neonatal heart to the calcium level of the cardioplegic solution.\r"

  ".W": "All surviving patients between 18 and 88 years of age receiving biological or mechanical prosthetic heart valves at the Yale-New Haven Hospital from January 1974 through January 1985 were analyzed for thromboembolism, anticoagulation-related hemorrhage, endocarditis, perivalvular leak, valve failure, need for reoperation, late cardiac death, and valve-related death. The rates of these events were analyzed in linear and actuarial terms over the 11 year period. A total of 533 patients received 606 biological valves (328 aortic, 252 mitral, 24 tricuspid, and two pulmonary, consisting of 482 Carpentier-Edwards, 108 Hancock, 15 Ionescu-Shiley, and one other), with a mean follow-up of 2,571 patient-years and 2,935 valve-years. They were compared with 479 patients with 510 mechanical valves (330 aortic, 175 mitral, and five tricuspid, consisting of 178 Starr-Edwards, 166 St. Jude Medical, 164 Bjork-Shiley, and two others), which were implanted for 2,247 patient-years and 2,392 valve-years. We found a significantly increased incidence of thromboembolism (p less than 0.001) and reoperation for perivalvular leak (p less than 0.05) in the mechanical valves compared with the biological valves, but a significantly increased rate of valve failure (p less than 0.001) in the biological valves compared with the mechanical valves. The overall analysis comparing total morbidity and valve-related mortality significantly (p less than 0.01) favored the biological valves in the first 5 years of the study and the mechanical valves (p less than 0.001) in the second 5 years of the study. However, the net 10 year results showed no significant difference between the two types of valves. In summary, we found little direct evidence to strongly support the generalized use of one type of valve over another.\r"

Two were weaned from bypass, with one long-term survivor. Three patients with acute respiratory failure were treated, with one survivor. salvaging high-risk neonates with minimal morbidity and mortality. It has also been useful in the support of infants with congenital heart disease and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In pediatric patients one cannot expect to get results that are comparable to those found in neonates. Still, this modality can be useful in salvaging some moribund patients with pulmonary or cardiac failure, or both.\r"

  ".W": "A series of recent articles advocate that blunt esophagectomy through neck and abdominal incisions has superior perioperative results to esophagogastrectomy via thoracotomy and abdominal approach. This prompted a review of a personal series of 40 consecutive esophagogastrectomies performed between July 1978 and December 1985. Diseases included squamous cell cancer in 15 patients, adenocarcinoma in 22, Barrett's esophagus with cancer in two, and fibromyomatoses in one. The approach was en bloc resection through an abdominal incision and right thoracotomy; a cervical incision and anastomosis was added for proximal lesions. All anastomoses were hand-sewn interrupted suture technique. Perioperative results were superior to those reported for blunt esophagectomy. Mortality was zero, no anastomotic leaks occurred, and no major pulmonary complications were seen. Four of the 40 patients required blood transfusions that totaled 8 units. Average preoperative hematocrit value was 38.9% +/- 5.44% (standard deviation) and postoperative hematocrit value was 35.57% +/- 6.06% (standard deviation). Average operating time was three hours and 26 minutes +/- 41.43 minutes and hospital stay was 11.1 +/- 4.62 days (standard deviation). Three patients required transient anastomotic dilations. It is concluded that esophagogastric en bloc resection which uses an abdominal and right thoracic approach can be accomplished with a low morbidity and mortality. A limited thoracic incision, double-lumen endotracheal tube, and self-retaining retraction on the lung minimized pulmonary trauma and respiratory problems were not a factor.\r"

The higher thresholds and multiple lead penetrations required of direct muscle stimulation for muscle conditioning were avoided. Vascular delay and protective wrapping of the myograft in four dogs resulted in rapid seroma and fibrous sheath formation, which precluded further study. Of the six other myografts that were stimulated, two were used as functional right ventricular myoventriculoplasties and four were employed as neoventricle myografts with inflow and outflow valved conduits that were used to provide total pulmonary blood flow. Myoventriculoplasty produced functional enlargement of the right ventricle with synchronously contractile muscle. Neoventricles provided hemodynamically stable total pulmonary blood flow for as long as 20 hours, until internal chamber thrombus formed. Transpulmonary blood pressure generation by the neoventricle was found to be programmable up to physiologic systemic pressures by modulation of chamber preload and burst stimulation frequency at 50 msec intervals, delivered 120 times per minute. Synchronization capabilities for implantable burst pulse generators would further improve the efficacy of these myograft techniques designed to augment or supplant ventricular function, particularly to provide transpulmonary blood flow at programmable pressures.\r"

  ".W": "In 1980 we described bilateral pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia, and circulatory arrest for the relief of pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic pulmonary embolism. In our subsequent experience, which totals 41 patients, we have identified three groups of patients characterized by differences of intraoperative management. In Group A (N = 16) myocardial protection consisted of single-dose crystalloid cardioplegia followed by pericardial irrigation with cold saline. Extrapericardial dissection of the pulmonary arteries was performed. Group B (N = 7) was treated the same as Group A except for the substitution of saline slush contained in a laparotomy pad for iced saline. In Group C (N = 18) myocardial protection was single-dose blood cardioplegia followed by the application of a specially designed cooling jacket to the right and left ventricles. Another modification was that of intrapericardial dissection of the pulmonary arteries with extension of the dissection into the hilar tissues without entrance into the pleural spaces. The hospital mortalities of Groups A, B, and C were 18.7%, 14.3%, and 5.5%, respectively (not statistically significant differences). However, other statistically significant differences (p less than 0.05) among the groups were observed: Phrenic nerve paresis occurred in five of seven (71%) Group B patients but in no Group A or C patients; Group B patients required ventilatory support for 32.2 days compared with 8.4 days for Group A and 6.2 days for Group C; time in the intensive care unit was 36 days for Group B patients versus 13 for Group A and 10.3 for Group C; pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 59% (649 versus 259) intraoperatively in 13 patients in Group C. We believe simultaneous bilateral pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest, and the modified methods of myocardial preservation and dissection represent current optimal surgical management of this problem.\r"

  ".W": "Two commercially available formulations of St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solutions, known as No. 1 (MacCarthy) and No. 2 (Plegisol, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.), were compared in the isolated working rat heart subjected to a long period (3 hours) of hypothermic ischemic arrest with multidose infusion. Solution No. 2 was found to be superior in nearly all respects. Of the 10 hearts infused with solution No. 1, persistent ventricular fibrillation during postischemic reperfusion occurred in six. Two of the six hearts, still in fibrillation after 15 minutes of reperfusion, were returned to regular rhythm by electrical defibrillation but failed to maintain an output. In contrast, in the 10 hearts infused with solution No. 2, ventricular fibrillation was short lasting (p less than 0.01). In comparing mechanical function in all hearts returning to regular rhythm (either spontaneously or after electrical defibrillation), the mean postischemic recoveries for aortic flow and rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (expressed as a percentage of its preischemic control) were significantly greater with solution No. 2 than with solution No. 1 (74.3% +/- 6.9% compared with 18.7% +/- 8.9%, p less than 0.01, and 98.0% +/- 6.0% compared with 63.0% +/- 9.0%, p less than 0.005, respectively). Creatine kinase leakage tended to be lower in hearts infused with solution No. 2 (19.7 +/- 4.7 IU/15 min/gm dry weight as opposed to 27.5 +/- 4.7 IU/15 min/gm dry weight), although this difference did not achieve a level of statistical significance. Consideration is given to the differences in formulation between solutions, which might account for the improved performance with solution No. 2, and it is concluded that the lower calcium content of solution No. 2 (1.2 as opposed to 2.4 mmol/L) is likely to be the most important factor.\r"

An oxygen/air/high-dose fentanyl anesthetic was used for all patients. Absolute neutrophil count increased significantly (p less than 0.05) after bypass and remained increased 48 hours afterward. Chemotaxis, random migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and phagocytic index were unaffected, but bactericidal capacity decreased significantly immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and remained decreased 48 hours later. Serum opsonizing capacity to bacterial and fungal antigens was variably altered, and complement factors 3 and 4 decreased significantly after cardiopulmonary bypass. Total hemolytic complement decreased significantly immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and returned to normal by 48 hours. These data suggest that operations with cardiopulmonary bypass in infants significantly affect the immunologic function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and result in consumption of complement.\r"

A severe pressure gradient across the kinked area (\"neo-coarctation\") necessitating reoperation developed in one patient. The acute arch angulation appears to be due to an excessive posterior displacement of the ascending aorta by the anterior relocation of either the right or left main pulmonary artery branch from underneath the aortic arch. A foreshortened and frequently hypoplastic transverse aortic arch, a common association with coarctation of the aorta, appears to be especially vulnerable to the development of \"neo-coarctation\" after the Lecompte modification of the anatomical repair of transposed great arteries.\r"

The need for long follow-up times to answer this question makes the growing sheep model an attractive alternative, given its ability to induce early valve degeneration. Sixty-three sheep, 12 to 16 weeks old, were operated on and received 39 porcine (11 Xenomedica, 10 Carpentier-Edwards S, nine Hancock I standard, and nine Hancock I T6-treated) and 24 pericardial (14 Mitroflow and 10 Ionescu-Shiley low profile) prostheses of clinical quality in the tricuspid position. Of the 52 operative survivors (32 received porcine valves and 20 received pericardial bioprostheses), six animals (five pericardial and one porcine) were eliminated because of bioprosthetic infection. Late sudden death before the scheduled killing occurred significantly more often (p less than 0.0001) in the pericardial (8/15 or 53%) than in the porcine group (1/31 or 3%). Calcium content of the explanted valves was significantly correlated with time in the pericardial group and the Xenomedica porcine prostheses (p less than 0.05) but not in the Hancock I and Carpentier-Edwards S valves, where it was only marginally significant (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05). Linear regression analysis of tissue calcium content showed a similar slope for the pericardial group and Xenomedica porcine valves, in comparison with the remaining porcine valves. Comparison between the two lines using covariance analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between them, which shows that the pericardial and Xenomedica porcine valves appear to reach higher levels of calcification in a shorter follow-up time than the Hancock I, standard and T6-treated, and the Carpentier-Edwards S valve in this animal model.\r"

  ".W": "From 1980 to 1985, 154 Omniscience valve prostheses were implanted in 132 patients (mitral in 72, aortic in 33, and both in 27), 81 women and 51 men, aged 22 to 72 years. There were 13 early deaths (30 day mortality of 9.8%) and nine late deaths. The actuarial survival rate was 79.1% after 4 years, and survival rates after aortic, mitral, and multiple valve replacement were 71.8%, 80%, and 85.2%, respectively. After a postoperative follow-up period averaging 27 months, 96% of the survivors were in Class I or II. The linearized incidence of thromboembolism, hemorrhagic episodes, and reoperation was 3.8%, 3.4%, and 2.3% per patient-year, respectively. After 4 years, freedom from valve-related mortality, valve-related mortality and reoperation, thromboembolic episodes, and all valve-related complications was 93%, 89%, 88%, and 70%. Moderate hemolysis with increases of reticulocyte count and serum lactic dehydrogenase above normal values was found in 80% of the patients, but only one had hemolytic anemia. In 22 patients, the maximal opening angle of the prosthetic disc averaged 54 +/- 11 degrees. Postoperative hemodynamic evaluation was obtained in five patients with aortic prostheses and in 13 with mitral prostheses. Mean aortic gradient and effective orifice area averaged 17.6 mm Hg and 1.2 cm2 at rest and increased to 18.8 mm Hg and 1.7 cm2 with exercise. With mitral prostheses, these values averaged 6.5 mm Hg and 1.9 cm2 at rest and 15.4 mm Hg and 2.1 cm2 with exercise. Thus excellent clinical improvement is obtained with the Omniscience prosthesis; however, the hemodynamic performance of the valve and opening of the tilting disc are suboptimal, causing the prosthesis to be moderately obstructive to blood flow.\r"

Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) can document the rhythm at the exact time that the patient is experiencing clinical symptoms. Our experience with TTM from 1979 to 1983 involved 526 patients who had one or more of the following symptoms: near-syncope (in 121), light-headedness (in 248), intermittent palpitations (in 281), and tachycardia (in 321). Patients suspected of having a life-threatening arrhythmia after the initial history, physical examination, and laboratory testing were excluded from this study. Of the 526 patients, 259 transmitted with the TTM device during a typical symptomatic episode; 186 had an arrhythmia identified, and 73 had a normal cardiac rhythm. The mean duration (+/- SD) from receipt of the TTM system until the first transmission was 48 +/- 80 days. The most frequent diagnoses at transmission were supraventricular tachycardia (in 80 patients) and sinus tachycardia (in 46). This study showed that TTM is effective in documenting infrequent arrhythmias and in establishing the temporal relationship between clinical symptoms and the patient's heart rhythm. TTM is a useful, practical, and efficient addition to more conventional means of electrocardiographic monitoring for patients with non-life-threatening arrhythmias.\r"

  ".U": "87114175\r", 
  ".W": "Among 646 patients with pure aortic stenosis who underwent valve replacement at our institution between 1981 and 1985, the three most frequent causes were calcification of congenitally bicuspid aortic valves (38%), degenerative (senile) calcification of tricuspid aortic valves (33%), and postinflammatory (presumably rheumatic) calcification and fibrosis (24%). Among the 324 patients younger than 70 years of age, calcified bicuspid valves were observed in 50%. In contrast, among 322 patients 70 years of age or older, degenerative calcification accounted for 48% of the stenotic aortic valves. During the 5 years of the study, the relative frequency of postinflammatory disease decreased from 30% to 18%, and that of bicuspid valves decreased from 37% to 33%. In contrast, the relative frequency of degenerative calcification increased from 30% to 46%. Consequently, degenerative (senile) calcification is currently the most common cause of aortic stenosis among patients undergoing valve replacement at our institution. This finding may be related to changes in life expectancy in the general population, alterations in patient referral practices, and an increased willingness of surgeons to operate on older patients. Regardless of cause, the observed temporal changes in etiologic factors for aortic stenosis may indicate a potential source of increasing health-care costs among the elderly population.\r"

The procedure was technically successful in more than 95% of the attempts. The outcome was clinical improvement in 89 limbs and no improvement in 40 limbs; in 19 limbs, PTA was technically successful but the patient was dismissed from the hospital and lost to follow-up before the extent of improvement could be determined. Mean ankle/brachial pressure indices increased after PTA in those with clinical improvement but not in those without improvement. Clinical improvement was less likely to follow PTA in patients with advanced age, diabetes, severe initial symptoms, low ankle/brachial indices, or distal occlusive disease. In patients with improvement after PTA, the mean follow-up period was 33 months; during that time, failure (defined as recurrence of the original symptoms or the need for repeat PTA or operation) occurred at a rate of 6.4% per year. Serious complications occurred after three procedures (2.0%). We conclude that PTA is technically feasible and generally safe for many patients with occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs.\r"

Eighty-three percent of the patients had preoperative evidence of facial neuropathy, which was more severe with larger tumors. Postoperative facial nerve function was most accurately predicted on the basis of the extent of facial neuropathy on preoperative electrophysiologic testing. Anatomic preservation of the facial nerve in patients with large tumors was substantially improved in the monitored patients (67%) in comparison with those without monitoring (33%). No difference was noted in facial nerve function in the two groups of patients immediately postoperatively. By 3 months, the degree of improvement in the monitored group exceeded that in those who were not monitored, particularly in patients with medium-sized and large tumors.\r"

Because tumors grow at 2 mm per year, and because elderly patients can expect to live up to 18 more years, we recommend planned total removal of an acoustic tumor as the management of choice for senior citizens in good health. We feel that the advantages of immediate surgery outweigh the risks of delayed surgery when age is advanced, the tumor is enlarged, and general health may be declining.\r"

The presence of ectopic gastric mucosa in the cervical esophagus, however, was not described. A review of the literature reveals that ectopic gastric mucosa of the cervical esophagus is not uncommon, but symptoms rarely have been attributed to its presence. This paper reports five patients with isolated inflamed ectopic gastric mucosa in the cervical esophagus who presented with odynophagia and/or dysphagia. Physical examination was unremarkable in each case, and an acid barium esophagram was negative in four of five patients. Factors that distinguish these patients from other cases of odynophagia and dysphagia, as well as detailed clinical findings and treatment, are described. Debate exists as to whether the origin of ectopic gastric mucosa is congenital or acquired. The embryology, gross and microscopic anatomy, and pathologic features are outlined. Patients with persistent dysphagia should have flexible fiberoptic esophagoscopy with an index of suspicion to the existence of ectopic gastric mucosa. Inflamed or ulcerated ectopic gastric mucosa in the cervical esophagus should be treated to relieve symptoms and because of the potential for complications.\r"

Type I anomalies are purely ectodermal while type II anomalies exhibit ectodermal and mesodermal elements. The type II anomaly incorporates some portion of the first and second arch as well as the cleft. Type I lesions are extremely rare. They appear histologically as cysts lined by squamous epithelium. Clinically, they present as a cystic mass or fistula posterior to the pinna and concha. The cyst is usually superior to the main trunk of the facial nerve and ends in a cul-de-sac on or near a bony plate at the level of the mesotympanum. Type II lesions are more numerous and represent a duplication of both membranous and cartilaginous portions of the external auditory canal. They contain skin as well as adnexal structures and cartilage and may be associated with the parotid gland. Most frequently they are associated with fistulae in the concha or external auditory canal as well as fistulous openings in the neck.\r"

Recently, we introduced an implantable Temporal Bone Stimulator (TBS) designed for those patients having a hearing loss due to external canal conditions; such as, external canal atresia or disease, inoperable ossicular problems, atelectasis or eustachian tube malfunction, and chronic open-cavity mastoid disease. This device requires relatively good cochlear function. However, the electromagnetic application of this device has led to the development of a new device we call the Implantable Hearing Device (IHD). This device stimulates, by an electromagnetic field, an independent electromagnetic sensitive prosthesis attached to the ossicular chain. This direct energy transfer to the ossicular chain provides a high degree of sound amplification and fidelity, thus providing benefit for those with various degrees of sensorineural hearing impairment. Preliminary disclosure of the device design, the animal experimental results, and the data from human testing will be given.\r"

Ten patients had postoperative palsies of the hypoglossal nerve as compared to six preoperatively. Other complications included CSF leak, meningitis, and wound infection. Aspiration and dysphagia were encountered postoperatively in 13 patients. Teflon injection of paretic vocal cords and cricopharyngeal myotomy effectively improved the ability to swallow and the quality of the voice.

A technique of external canal resection and gross tumor removal from the middle ear, parotid gland, and superior cervical lymph nodes is followed by postoperative full-therapy irradiation. This combined approach has been used in 30 patients with malignancies involving the external auditory canal and temporal bone. The preoperative evaluation and surgical technique, including the intraoperative decision-making process, is described. Twenty-four patients had squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal, and two patients had basal cell carcinoma. There was one patient each with adenocystic carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and a giant cell tumor of bone. This group of patients was broken down into three groups based on the extent of disease as determined at surgery. Overall control of disease, both locally and distant, for the 30 patients was 66%. There were 12 patients with disease limited to the ear canal. These patients had a 91% survival of this disease process. Seven patients were determined to have limited extension beyond the ear canal. These were treated with combined therapy with an overall control of disease of 72%. Eleven patients had extensive disease outside of middle ear into the carotid jugular spine, stylomastoid foramen, and skull base, with a survival rate of 45%. It is concluded that a step-wise removal of all gross tumor, as opposed to an en bloc dissection of the temporal bone and skull base, followed by full-therapy irradiation gives equally as good, or even better, long-term survival for this malignancy of the external auditory canal and middle ear.\r"

This produces a complete denervation of the vestibular labyrinth and preserves the patient's hearing. All ten patients with Meniere's disease had their vertigo cured. Hearing was preserved to within 11 dB of the preoperative pure tone average in 9 of 10 cases. There were no serious complications, no cases of facial paralysis, and no cases of total hearing loss. These results compare favorably with the MFVN and the RVN. The retrosigmoid IAC vestibular neurectomy is an important improvement in the evolution of vestibular neurectomy for the treatment of vertigo.\r"

The utilization of high-resolution computerized tomography to provide such information in a group of infants and children with choanal atresia forms the basis for this report. The application of computed tomography in the evaluation of choanal atresia and preoperative surgical planning is discussed. Based on this experience, we feel that the introduction of high-resolution computerized tomography is a significant advance in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to choanal atresia and should be the single radiographic procedure of choice.\r"

In the present study, 353 serially sectioned total laryngectomy specimens were examined and the saccule measured with a steel ruler. Saccules extending superior or posterior to the thyroid cartilage were considered as large. Larynges were classified as \"cancer\" or \"normal\", the latter being uninvaded organs from patients with adjacent disease. Among the 242 cancer larynges, there were 43 specimens where the saccule exceeded thyroid cartilage dimensions, a laryngocele rate of 17.8%. Mean saccule height was significantly greater in cancer than in normal specimens in coronal sections (P = 0.04), and mean saccule length was significantly greater in cancer than in normal specimens in horizontal sections (P = 0.001). The incidence of large saccules showed a difference between cancer and normal larynges which was highly significant (P = 0.0002).\r"

Following this slow-developing hypoxemia, a sequence of events concerning the ear could be observed. Firstly, a fluctuation in cochlear action potentials (CAP) was noted. This appeared only at stimulus intensities near the threshold and was not evident at higher intensities. At a mean arterial pO2 level of 30 mm Hg, this phenomenon was observed in 60% of the GP. At a mean pO2 of 24.66 mm Hg, a shift in threshold occurred in all GP. Finally, when the blood pO2 reached an average of 14.92 mm Hg, no CAP response could be elicited, even at click intensity of 120 dB SPL. The 30 mm Hg oxygen concentration in the arterial blood was considered as a \"critical level\" at which the cochlear function starts to deteriorate in guinea pigs.\r"

Considering other forms of failure (such as precholesteatoma, tympanic membrane perforation, and chronic infection), overall failure rates were 33% (CWD) compared with 82% (CWU). Cholesteatoma recurrence failure rates were higher in patients under the age of 20 (33%) than over the age of 20 (19%). Overall failure rates were 61% and 37% for younger and older patients, respectively. Due to the high failure rate with canal wall up techniques in resident hands, it is recommended that resident service cases be treated with canal wall down technique, especially in the younger age group.\r"

As most of these tumors retain the ability to manufacture active parathyroid hormone, most patients with the disease present with hypercalcemia, many times symptomatic. Since the tumor accounts for only 0.5% to 4.0% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma may be unsuspected and delayed. The clinical index of suspicion should be elevated if there is a palpable neck mass, an exceptionally high serum calcium level, and/or recurrence of hypercalcemia following surgery. We review two patients with parathyroid carcinoma who presented with hypercalcemia. In both, the diagnosis of malignancy was made only after microscopic examination of the operative specimen. Surgery consisted of wide local excision in both cases; radiation therapy was administered in one. Postoperative disease-free status is now 23 and 37 months. One of the patients had a history of radiation therapy to the larynx 20 years prior to the development of parathyroid carcinoma. Also reviewed in this paper are the clinical and histopathologic criteria for making the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma and the therapeutic approaches and prognosis of this unusual tumor.\r"

At the center of the cristae, thick fibers align in two parallel rows along the long axis; in the periphery of the cristae, thin fibers predominate. Within the superior vestibular nerve the thick fibers of the anterior and horizontal semicircular canals and utricle are situated in the anterosuperior area, the thin fibers in the posterior part. A similar segregation occurs with fibers of the posterior ampullary nerve and the saccule within the inferior vestibular nerve. The fibers continue to segregate at the root entry zone where they lose their Schwann's cell ensheathing and begin to divide into secondary central branches. There is a correspondence between the volume of the ganglion cell and the fiber diameter; hence, a segregation of ganglion cells according to their size also takes place in the vestibular nerve. The organization of the primate's vestibular nerve is similar to that found earlier in an anuran. The relevance of the phylogenetic preservation of the vestibular nerve's anatomical organization is discussed in terms of current physiological findings, which support the differential role of fibers of different diameters in vestibular function.\r"

Pulse energies bracketing the damage thresholds and focal diameter were tabulated. The energy density and power density thresholds for perforation of the pupillary membranes (hereafter referred to as perforation threshold) were slightly lower and power density damage thresholds higher for shorter duration pulses, eg--66 J/cm2 (2,200 GW/cm2) with the picosecond pulse trains vs 80 J/cm2 (2.7 GW/cm2) with the nanosecond pulses and were similar in pseudophakics and aphakics; 78 J/cm2 for pseudophakics vs 83 J/cm2 aphakics, both treated with single nanosecond Nd-YAG pulses, and 68 J/cm2 for pseudophakic vs 66 J/cm2 for aphakic patients treated with picosecond Nd-YAG laser pulse trains. The number of laser pulses and pulse energies required for successful discussion of the pupillary membranes depended not only on the pulse parameters but also on the characteristics of the membrane, such as thickness, nonuniformity, capsular haze, or capsular haze combined with fibrosis.\r"

The analysis leads to the required incident irradiance for front surface illumination as a function of the tumor depth, the optical penetration depth of the tumor, and the concentration of localized sensitizer. The effect of HPD photobleaching on the required light dose and drug dose levels is considered. The results are given in tabular form for typical clinical applications.\r"

Such procedures are usually performed under deep general anesthesia with the horse in dorsal recumbency. The objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of an endoscopic approach coupled to a Nd:YAG laser fiber in performing arytenoidectomy. Arytenoidectomy is commonly indicated in the treatment of arytenoid chondritis and in the failure of prosthetic implantation for left laryngeal hemiplegia. This preliminary study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of the endoscopic laser approach to ablate the most difficult of the structures of the larynx, considering tissue structure and density. This procedure was accomplished by using heavy sedation and local anesthesia and was performed in the standing position. This approach appears to be feasible and makes other adjacent structures accessible via the endoscope coupled to a surgical laser. Indications for future pilot applications of laser surgery in the equine larynx are entrapment of the epiglottis, dorsal soft palate displacement, and the ablation of laryngeal cysts and polyps. This pilot study appears to offer a new modality for discrete surgical ablation of this structure, with minimal postoperative complications and a reduced or equivalent convalescent period in this valuable species of animal.\r"

Most patients are asymptomatic and come to attention because of abnormal radiographic findings of a round or lobulated perihilar, solid, or cystic mass--the mucoid impaction sign. Typically, the region distal to the mass is hyperinflated. Recently, computed tomography has been shown to be diagnostic and its use obviates the need for other more complex imaging modalities or surgical exploration. Excisional surgery has been performed to preserve lung function in younger patients, because of lack of familiarity with the entity or, as in 2 of our cases, to prevent recurrent infections. Pathologic findings include a cystic, blindly terminating, mucus-filled bronchocele without connection to the main bronchial tree, but with normal subsequent generations of bronchi. Distally there is noncollapsible hyperinflation of the corresponding lung segment or lobe as the result of collateral ventilation from the surrounding lung. The anomaly is the result of an insult to the growing bronchial tree in early development. The differential diagnosis most often includes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but cystic bronchiectasis, bronchogenic cysts, and intrapulmonary sequestration should also be considered. Unusual features in our 4 cases included recurrent pulmonary infections in 2 patients and thoracic cage asymmetry in 1.\r"

Investigation of a 4.9-fold increase in Salmonella newport isolations from Californians in 1985 showed that 87 percent of the isolates had an unusual antimicrobial-resistance pattern (including chloramphenicol resistance) and a single, identical plasmid. Interviews of 45 patients and 89 matched controls in Los Angeles County showed that illness was associated with penicillin or tetracycline use during the month before onset (P less than 0.001) and with eating ground beef during the week before onset (P = 0.052). The epidemic strain was isolated from hamburger products eaten by cases, abattoirs where the animals from which the meat came were slaughtered, dairies that sent cows for slaughter on days when culture-positive products were processed, and ill dairy cows. Isolation of salmonella from beef carcasses in abattoirs correlated with the proportion of dead or moribund animals received for slaughter (r = 0.60, P less than 0.05). Isolation of chloramphenicol-resistant salmonella from dairy farms was associated with the use of chloramphenicol at those dairies. We conclude that food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans and that these infections are associated with antimicrobial use on farms.\r"

We found only a single base substitution (T----C) in exon X. This mutation results in the substitution of proline for leucine in position number 444 and produces a new cleavage site for the NciI restriction endonuclease. We analyzed NciI enzymatic digests of genomic DNA from 20 patients with type 1, 5 with type 2, and 11 with type 3 Gaucher's disease, and 29 normal controls for a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP). Four of 5 patients with type 2 disease and all 11 with type 3 disease had at least one allele with the mutation. Two of 5 patients with type 2 disease and 7 of 11 with type 3 were homozygous for this mutation. Only 4 of 20 patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease had the mutant allele and were heterozygous for it. None of the 29 normal controls had the mutant allele. The high frequency of this mutation (444leucine----proline) in patients with neuronopathic Gaucher's disease, detectable by the NciI RFLP, may be of value in the identification of patients who will have the neurologic sequelae of Gaucher's disease.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the possibility that immune injury to endothelial cells may have a role in the development of thrombosis in some patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia. Serum samples from each of 27 patients who had this clinical diagnosis contained heparin-dependent platelet antibodies and deposited more than normal amounts of IgG, IgA, or IgM on endothelial cells, stimulating the production of tissue factor. Binding of immunoglobulins to endothelial cells was no longer detected when the patients were studied after heparin was withdrawn, but reappeared within several days upon reexposure to heparin in a patient who experienced a clinical recurrence. Binding of immunoglobulin to endothelial cells was partially reduced by the preadsorption of serum samples with heparin or heparan sulfate bound to Sepharose or by enzymatic cleavage of cell-bound heparan sulfate, and was augmented by the addition of heparan sulfate. Thus, serum from some patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia may contain antibodies that react with heparin bound to endothelial cells or with heparan sulfate synthesized by endothelial cells. Immune injury to both platelets and endothelial cells may play a part in the development of thrombosis in some patients after heparin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We treated two children who had adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe combined immunodeficiency disease by injecting bovine adenosine deaminase modified by conjugation with polyethylene glycol. The modified enzyme was rapidly absorbed after intramuscular injection and had a half-life in plasma of 48 to 72 hours. Weekly doses of approximately 15 U per kilogram of body weight maintained plasma adenosine deaminase activity at two to three times the level of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity in normal subjects. The principal biochemical consequences of adenosine deaminase deficiency were almost completely reversed. In erythrocytes, adenosine nucleotides increased and deoxyadenosine nucleotides decreased to less than 0.5 percent of total adenine nucleotides. The activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which is inactivated by deoxyadenosine, increased to normal in red cells and nucleated marrow cells. Neither toxic effects nor hypersensitivity reactions were observed. In vitro tests of the cellular immune function of each patient showed marked improvement, along with an increase in circulating T lymphocytes. Clinical improvement was indicated by absence of infection and resumption of weight gain. We conclude that from the standpoints of efficacy, convenience, and safety, polyethylene glycol-modified adenosine deaminase is preferable to red-cell transfusion as a treatment for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Patients with other inherited metabolic diseases in which accumulated metabolites equilibrate with plasma could benefit from treatment with the appropriate polyethylene glycol-modified enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "Aluminum-associated bone disease is a special problem in uremic patients on hemodialysis. We have observed this disorder in uremic patients with insulin-dependent diabetes soon after the start of dialysis treatments. We therefore studied bone biopsy specimens from 18 diabetic patients on hemodialysis to determine whether aluminum accumulates on bone surfaces at an accelerated rate in diabetes. We also measured the rates of bone formation, because lower rates may enhance the accumulation of aluminum on bone surfaces. As compared with 18 nondiabetic controls with uremia who were matched for age and duration of dialysis, the patients with diabetes had a higher rate of aluminum accumulation on bone surfaces (2.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.2 percent per month, P less than 0.01) and a lower rate of bone formation (117 +/- 50 vs. 396 +/- 81 microns 2 per square millimeter per day, P less than 0.01). Also, the patients with diabetes whose cumulative aluminum intake exceeded 0.5 kg had higher serum aluminum levels after an infusion of deferoxamine, as compared with controls matched for aluminum intake (P less than 0.01). These measurements reflected a higher aluminum content in the whole body in patients with diabetes. We suggest that the enhanced rate of aluminum accumulation on bone surfaces in uremic patients with diabetes occurs as a result of a low rate of bone formation and an increased accumulation of aluminum in the whole body.\r"

  ".W": "Postmortem studies suggest that coronary angiography does not always accurately delineate the extent of coronary-artery disease. We examined this problem in living human hearts by performing high-frequency epicardial echocardiography at the time of cardiac surgery. The ratio of the diameter of the lumen of the coronary artery to the thickness of its wall was used to quantify the severity of coronary lesions. In 11 patients with no angiographic evidence of coronary disease anywhere in the coronary tree, the mean (+/- SEM) ratio was 5.9 +/- 0.3. In 21 patients with angiographic disease at the site evaluated by echocardiography, the mean ratio was lower (2.3 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.05), reflecting encroachment into the arterial lumen by atherosclerotic plaque. In 15 patients with arterial segments that were angiographically normal but with arterial stenoses elsewhere in the coronary tree, the mean ratio was 4.1 +/- 0.3, with marked overlap with the values in the patients who had angiographic disease at the site of the echocardiographic evaluation. These results demonstrate, in living human hearts, that diffuse coronary atherosclerosis is often present when coronary angiography reveals only discrete stenoses. This finding suggests that coronary angiography may underestimate the severity and extent of coronary disease.\r"

Because it is useful for taking a first look at a new problem, it is applicable to a broad range of interesting phenomena. Furthermore, it emphasizes method rather than arcane knowledge and illustrates the approaches to problems and the kinds of thinking that a liberal education should cultivate: the scientific method, analogic thinking, deductive reasoning, problem solving within constraints, and concern for aesthetic values.\r"

Persons treated with hypnotics-anxiolytics having short (less than or equal to 24 hours) elimination half-lives had no increased risk of hip fracture. By contrast, a significantly increased risk was associated with current use of hypnotics-anxiolytics having long (greater than 24 hours) elimination half-lives (odds ratio, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.4), tricyclic antidepressants (odds ratio, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.8), and antipsychotics (odds ratio, 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 2.6). The risk increased in relation to the doses of drugs in these three classes. An analysis for possible confounding by dementia did not alter the results. Previous but noncurrent use of drugs in these classes conferred no increase in risk. Although a cause-and-effect relation was not proved, these data support the hypothesis that the sedative and autonomic effects of psychotropic drugs increase the risk of falling and fractures in elderly persons. The results suggest the need for studies of this association in other populations and for evaluation of newer psychotropic drugs with fewer undesirable sedative and autonomic effects.\r"

We studied antibody responses to neural antigens in 36 patients with major neurologic complications, 25 with minor complications, and 39 with no complications after immunization with a brain-derived, Semple rabies vaccine. Patients with major complications had significantly elevated levels of antibody to brain white matter as compared with the other groups (P less than 0.001). Assays for antibody to selected central nervous system antigens showed that high levels of serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibody to myelin basic protein correlated with the presence of major neurologic complications (both central and peripheral nervous systems). The level of antibody to cerebroside correlated best with the number of injections of vaccine, but like antibody to myelin basic protein, the antibody to cerebroside was present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with major complications. Some patients with major complications also had antibodies directed to the gangliosides GD1b and GT1b. No antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein were detected in any of the samples. These data implicate myelin basic protein as an encephalitogen in these autoimmune diseases of the human nervous system, but suggest that immune responses to cerebroside and certain gangliosides may have an augmentative role in severe disease.\r"
