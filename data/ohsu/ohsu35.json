  ".W": "The hemodynamic consequences of neonatal polycythemic hyperviscosity and the effects of partial exchange transfusion were evaluated in 13 infants. Mean (+/- SD) venous hematocrit was 72% +/- 2.5%. After partial exchange transfusion, whole blood viscosity at a shear rate of 11.5 sec-1 decreased from 16.2 to 8.4 centipoise. There were significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate (127 +/- 7.5 to 139 +/- 7.8 beats/min), Doppler-derived cardiac index (200 +/- 35 to 263 +/- 48 ml/kg/min), left ventricular stroke volume index (1.56 +/- 0.23 to 1.89 +/- 0.33 ml/kg), systemic oxygen transport (51.4 +/- 8.4 to 57.9 +/- 11.9 ml/kg/min), and laser-Doppler peripheral (cutaneous) blood flow (+80%) after partial exchange transfusion. The increase in cardiac index probably resulted from reductions in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance index, the latter decreasing from 0.26 to 0.19 mm Hg/ml/min/kg-1. The greater increase in cutaneous blood flow (+80%) versus cardiac index (+32%) after exchange transfusion suggests hemodynamic compromise and a redistribution of blood flow away from organs that use little oxygen during polycythemia. Our data provide a possible basis for the symptoms of neonatal polycythemia, and demonstrate the acute hemodynamic benefits of partial exchange transfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function was measured in 39 infants with chronic lung disease who had required mechanical ventilation starting during the first week of life for a median of 9 days (range 1 to 46 days) and supplemental oxygen for a median of 48 days (range 28-162 days). Their mean birth weight was 1140 g (range 550 to 2325 g), and mean gestational age 29.8 weeks (range 26 to 37 weeks). Ventilation was measured by pneumotachography, esophageal pressure through a water-filled feeding tube, and functional residual capacity (FRC) by a modified nitrogen washout technique. Lung compliance, pulmonary conductance, and FRC were determined at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after birth. Pulmonary function was also determined in 40 normal children, ranging in age from neonates to 5 years, who served as controls. In infants with chronic lung disease, growth in weight and length followed the 10th to 25th percentiles of the normal curve. Minute ventilation and respiratory effort remained elevated throughout the follow-up. FRC per kilogram of body weight was decreased at 1, 3, and 6 months after birth, but thereafter was in the normal range. FRC increased in proportion to weight at the same rate as in the controls. Lung compliance was only half of normal at 1 month, increased with growth in close correlation with weight, and was approximately 80% of normal at the end of follow-up. Pulmonary conductance was 50% of normal at 1 month, increased little during the first 6 months, but reached 85% of normal at 3 years of age. There was no evidence of gas trapping. These results indicate that in infants with chronic lung disease after mechanical ventilation, lung volume increases normally, probably by formation of new alveoli, which also leads to improvement in lung compliance. Airway growth is slow during the first 6 months after birth, but the subsequent faster growth leads to conductance values close to normal at 3 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "In a 1-year prospective study, the outcome in infants with a platelet count less than 100 X 10(9)/L (n = 97) was compared with the outcome in an age-, weight-, and disease-matched nonthrombocytopenic control group (n = 80). The hemostatic impact of the thrombocytopenia was assessed by modified template bleeding time, hemorrhage score, and determination of the presence and extent of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in thrombocytopenic infants weighing less than 1500 at birth (n = 39) compared with all nonthrombocytopenic infants less than 1500 g (n = 122) admitted during the study period. The development outcome in infants less than 1500 g was compared at 12 months after delivery. Neonatal thrombocytopenia had a major impact on hemostatic integrity: bleeding time was inversely related to platelet count (r = -0.56, P less than 0.001) and became prolonged when the platelet count fell to less than 100 X 10(9)/L. In addition, many infants (40%) had evidence of platelet dysfunction with prolonged bleeding times despite only moderately reduced platelet counts (75 to 150 X 10(9)/L). The hemorrhage score was greater in the thrombocytopenic infants compared with the sick control infants, and increased as the platelet count fell (r = -0.58, P less than 0.001). The incidence of IVH in thrombocytopenic infants less than 1500 g was 78%, compared with 48% in the nonthrombocytopenic infants (P less than 0.01). In addition, the more severe grades of IVH were more frequent in the thrombocytopenic infants. The serious neurologic morbidity for the surviving infants less than 1500 g was 41% in the thrombocytopenic infants and 7% in the nonthrombocytopenic infants. Thus, on the basis of three indices of abnormal bleeding, thrombocytopenic infants are at greater risk for bleeding than equally sick nonthrombocytopenic infants. The thrombocytopenia itself may have contributed to the high mortality and neurologic morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Relations between adolescent psychosocial adjustment problems and markers of biologic development, including chronologic age, pubertal status, and serum hormone levels, were examined in 56 normal boys and 52 normal girls, ages 9 to 14 years. Adolescent psychosocial adjustment was assessed by adolescent self-ratings of various aspects of self-image (Offer Self-Image Questionnaire for Adolescents) and parent ratings of adolescent behavior problems (Child Behavior Checklist). The pubertal status measure used in the analyses was Tanner genital stage for boys and Tanner breast stage for girls. The hormone measures, determined by radioimmunoassay, were serum levels of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone), sex steroids (testosterone and estradiol), and adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate, and androstenedione). The testosterone/estradiol ratio also was computed. Overall, findings were stronger, more consistent, and more generalized for boys than for girls. For boys, adjustment problems typically were associated with a multivariate profile that may be characteristic for later maturers: relatively low sex steroid levels, or lower pubertal stage, and relatively high adrenal androgen (androstenedione) levels, frequently in conjunction with higher chronologic age. Univariate relations predominated for girls; that is, associated with adjustment problems for girls were relatively high levels of gonadotropins, relatively low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and relatively high levels of androstenedione on their own or in conjunction with lower pubertal stage. Higher levels of androstenedione, a steroid particularly responsive to stress, were associated with adjustment problems in both boys and girls. This relation may reflect the stress of later maturation, which could result from environmental factors, such as adolescent self-comparisons with same-age peers, or endogenous effects of hormones.\r"

In whole blood from 30 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 10 normal subjects, and 40 patients with active seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there were negative correlations between the hematocrit level and the ASA half-life in vitro: r = -0.50, -0.83, and -0.61, respectively. When ASA hydrolysis rates were normalized to approximate whole blood esterase content (k/Hb [min-1 X g-1 X dl] X 10(-4) the mean rate was most rapid in patients with RA (24.2 +/- 2.8) and lowest in patients with SLE (18.6 +/- 3.1), especially in those with recently active disease. To differentiate intracellular and extracellular factors, ASA hydrolysis rates were measured in washed RBC suspensions from similar groups. The mean ASA hydrolysis rate (k/10(6) RBC X 10(-3) was significantly lower in SLE RBC (7.72 +/- 0.81). In RBC from patients with RA the average rate (8.50 +/- 0.85) lay between the SLE group and controls (9.08 +/- 1.04). Thus, an erythrocyte esterase defect in SLE patients resulted in reduced ASA hydrolyzing capacity. In blood from patients with RA a small reduction in esterase activity was compensated by extracellular factors increasing ASA accessibility to the esterase.\r"

There was minimal or no loss of function in the operated knee at one month.

No sustained loss of movement was observed in the operated knee and all patients had improvement in knee flexion at 24 months. Patients universally regarded the procedure as worthwhile.

We identified this disorder in 2 generations and found evidence for its presence in a third. It occurred in 2 sibling children at multiple sites. All affected individuals also had a rare autosomal dominant disorder, the multiple lentigines syndrome. Among the developmental abnormalities in this kindred were fibrous dysplasia, hypertelorism, pectus excavatum, high arched palate, and primary lymphedema. The etiology of pigmented villonodular synovitis is uncertain, and suggested causes include trauma, inflammation, neoplasia, and repeated hemorrhage. Our observations suggest genetic factors might also be important in the development of pigmented villonodular synovitis.\r"

The peptide elution pattern seen for the individuals with confirmed amyloidosis is consistent for the presence of a prealbumin variant with a methionine for valine at position 30 of the molecule. Sequence analysis of the isolated peptides confirms this observation and shows that the 3 Brazilian families investigated in our study have the same prealbumin variant as individuals with amyloidosis of Swedish/American, Portuguese and Japanese origins.\r"

The mean annual loss of bone, assessed over an 18 month period in 17 patients, was 2.9% (p less than 0.001). Compared to controls, bone mineral content was increased by 28% (p less than 0.05) in 8 male patients while metacarpal indices were normal in 18 male and female patients. The results of total body calcium measurements give support to the hypothesis of a minor increase in bone turnover in AS. The increased bone mineral content in the male patients may relate to syndesmophyte formation.\r"

Ten undergraduate institutions with at least 20 matriculants in each group were selected for analysis. Group 1 students had taken the old version and group 2 the new version of the MCAT. Scores on the Science subtest of the old MCAT were used as the predictor for group 1, and scores on the Science Problems subtest of the new MCAT were used as the predictor for group 2. First-year and second-year medical school grade-point averages and total scores on the Part I and Part II examinations of the National Board of Medical Examiners were the performance measures used. Validity coefficients were derived of the predictive value of the MCAT scores at each of the 10 undergraduate institutions. Striking differences were found in validity coefficients among these institutions. These differences raise questions about the predictive validity of the MCAT when scores for different undergraduate institutions are combined in deriving the coefficients. Possible explanations, implications for admissions decisions and validity studies, and limitations of these findings are discussed.\r"

The minutes of the school's student progress committee for four years were reviewed to identify all students who had had academic difficulty. Seven students had been recommended for dismissal but ultimately graduated, 22 students were on academic probation for longer than one year, and 22 students were on academic probation for less than one year. The residency performance of 43 of these 51 students were compared with the performances of a randomly selected group of students who had had no academic difficulties and had graduated during the same period. Of 12 performance and knowledge items assessed by the residency directors for the studied graduates, the one dealing with quality of interaction with patients showed significant differences among the residents. The residents who had had academic difficulty had lower ratings on this item than the residents who had not had academic trouble. On all other items, those residents who had had academic difficulties received generally lower scores than the other residents, but the differences were not statistically significant. Of the seven students considered for dismissal, one had been dismissed and one had withdrawn from the residencies; the other five generally received positive ratings from their residency directors. The findings suggest that the medical school's overall monitoring of students' performance was working and confirmed the authors' opinion that each decision concerning a student with academic difficulties should be based on the student's individual situation.\r"

ELISA analysis revealed binding of anti-SAP MAb to a serum protein present in both whole burn and normal serum, but only to burn serum using a less than 25,000-mw serum fraction. This suggests that SAP may be an injury-induced degradation product of a greater than 25,000-mw serum protein. Immunoblotting using a less than 25,000-mw burn serum fraction demonstrated MAb binding to a single low molecular weight protein band. Using the MAb in an ELISA immunodiagnostic procedure, it appeared that SAP levels were significantly elevated in the sera of burned patients who died from their injuries compared to levels in sera of controls or patients who survived.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between retained fluid and survival has previously been reported from our burn unit. Two hundred thirty cc/kg lean body mass accurately delineated survivors from nonsurvivors. Our previous study did not account for fluid lost through the burn wound. This study was undertaken to evaluate fluid retention per square meter of body surface area which has been corrected for fluid loss from the burn wound using a formula suggested by Mason et al. Data collected from 95 adult patients with burns greater than or equal to 20% body surface area burn (mean age, 42.4 years; mean burn size, 37.7%), who were admitted to our burn unit between January 1978 and September 1985, were evaluated. All patients included in the study were adequately resuscitated and survived the initial 48 hours. A calculation of the total fluid retained during the first 48 hours postburn and estimation of fluid loss from the burn wound were made. A comparison was made between lean body retained fluid and surface area retained fluid. A positive correlation (r = 0.921; p less than 0.001) was demonstrated between these two methods of assessing fluid retention. Fluid retention determined by either method resulted in a higher correlation with survival than any single predictor (age, per cent body surface area burned) of burn survival. Surface area fluid is as accurate as lean body fluid in predicting survival. Additionally, we determined that for the first 48 hours postburn, 4,425 cc fluid retained per meter square body surface area accurately differentiated survivors from nonsurvivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One factor contributing to negative nitrogen balance in burned patients is protein loss through the burn wound. There is, however, little information on the amount and type of protein lost by this route. This study was designed to quantitate protein loss through burn wounds. Multiple full- and partial-thickness burns on 29 patients were studied. Sampled burn sites were dried and occlusive sponge dressings (2'' X 2'') were applied and left in place for 1 hour. The central 1 square-inch portion of the dressing was then removed, rinsed in distilled water, and total protein, albumin, and globulin were measured in the water wash. Considerable protein losses were measured. These losses were greatest in the first 3 postburn days, being somewhat greater in full-thickness burns (0.98 +/- 0.82 mg/cm2/hr) compared to partial-thickness burns (0.59 +/- 0.41 mg/cm2/hr) during this period mean +/- SD). Subsequent to the first 3 postburn days, protein loss in all burn types decreased to a relatively steady rate of loss of approximately 0.25 mg/cm2/hr. Based upon these data, average daily protein losses during the first postburn week can be estimated by the following equation: 24-hour protein loss through burn surface (gm) = 1.2 X body surface area (m2) X % burn (%). On subsequent days, protein is lost at approximately half this rate. These data demonstrate significant protein losses through burn wounds greater than recent studies have considered. It is possible that inadequate nutritional replacement of these protein losses is partly responsible for the marked negative nitrogen balance of the early postburn period.\r"

To test the hypothesis that ongoing skin damage occurring postburn (PB) may in part be due to release of oxygen-derived free radicals during the 16-hour through 4-day PB period of reperfusion in such burns, beginning immediately and for a period of 5 days PB, equal numbers of guinea pigs received: allopurinol 150 mg/kg PO q 6 h vs. placebo, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 75% applied topically q 12 h vs. placebo, or yeast-derived superoxide dismutase coupled with polyethylene glycol (PEG-SOD, Pharmacia) 10,000 U (Fridovich) given IV q 8 h producing a concentration of 16 U/cc of plasma 8 hr after injection vs. placebo. Gross and histologic examination of wounds by a 'blinded' investigator at 1 week and 3 weeks PB revealed no difference between treatment and control groups when rates of re-epithelialization and frequencies of hair-follicle retention were compared. Using the dosages, routes, and model described, treatment of a zone-of-stasis burn with PO allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor), topical DMSO (a scavenger of the hydroxyl radical), or IV PEG-SOD (a scavenger of the superoxide radical) during the first 5 days PB was associated with no increase in the rate of re-epithelialization or frequency of hair follicle retention at 1 and 3 weeks PB when compared with controls.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of enflurane anesthesia on the oxygen supply-demand balance have been studied in nine hypermetabolic-hyperdynamic burned patients undergoing debridement and skin-grafting procedures. Mean burn size was 55% of total body surface area. The patients were without cardiac, lung, hepatic, and kidney dysfunction and were not septic. Anesthesia was induced with sodium pentothal and maintained with enflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Ventilation was controlled to maintain PaCO2 within normal limits. Crystalloid solutions and blood were administered to maintain adequate heart filling pressures. Serial measurements of cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, and oxygen content were made before, during, and after anesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia and enflurane administration, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption decreased in a parallel fashion to approximately 60% of control. These variables did not change significantly throughout the procedure and returned to control values when enflurane was discontinued. Arteriovenous oxygen content difference did not increase and metabolic acidosis did not develop, suggesting that tissue perfusion remained adequate. Under anesthesia, oxygen consumption in burned patients was similar to that observed in normal subjects, indicating that enflurane blunts the hypermetabolic effects of thermal injury. It is concluded that in burned patients enflurane decreases metabolic rate and cardiac output, and maintains an adequate oxygen supply-demand balance.\r"

Pulmonary artery catheters were placed in 21 adult male pigs under pentobarbital anesthesia and breathing room air. After a control period, animals were studied in four groups: Group 1, anesthesia only; Group 2, infusion of 1 X 10(9) ml Aeromonas hydrophila which was gradually increased from 0.2 ml/kg/hr to 4.0 ml/kg/hr over 4 hours; Group 3, pretreatment with SQ 29,548 (TXA2 antagonist) then Aeromonas h. infusion; Group 4, infusion of U46619 (TXA2 agonist) to pulmonary artery pressures measured in Group 2. Animals were sacrificed after 4 hours and the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and heart were examined under light microscopy by a pathologist unaware of study groups. The results indicated that physiologic thromboxane A2 agonist (Group 4) was sufficient alone to cause pulmonary inflammation. Thromboxane A2 was neither necessary nor sufficient for significant renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or splenic pathology to occur in graded bacteremia, manifested in similar microanatomic abnormalities in these organs in Groups 2 and 3 and in Groups 1 and 4. Pulmonary leukocyte infiltration was significantly increased in Group 3 compared to all other groups, suggesting that TXA2 impairs inflammatory responses.\r"

The patients received either conservative therapy or early massive excision of all full-thickness burns. The two groups were similar in average size of burn but differed in their average age. In the patients with burns greater than 50% TBSA and no inhalation injury, mortality was decreased with early excision, which can be explained entirely by age differences alone. There was not a significant difference in length of stay, blood requirements, or in mortality in other groups of patients.\r"

Suppression of GVH reactivity was observed using isolated splenocytes from burned mice harvested on postburn days 3, 8, and 11. Lymphocyte response evaluated in the burn environment using the HVG assay was profoundly deficient on postburn days 3 and 11. Recovery of immune function as determined by measurements of both responses occurred by postburn days 14-21, and coincided with wound healing. The PLNA proved to be a sensitive measure of immune function, and allowed for the evaluation of isolated cell populations, as well as measurement of lymphocyte function in the burn environment in the presence of circulating suppressor factors.\r"

Energy expenditures were measured in 20 patients by indirect calorimetry (MEE) and estimated initially by the Curreri formula (CEE) and subsequently by a modification of the Curreri formula (MCEE), adjusted for changes in open wound size and body weight. Urinary urea nitrogen (UUN) excretions were measured over 24 hours. Second- and third-degree burns, initially involving 31% to 74% of the body surface areas, were reduced in size to less than 15% by excisions and grafting procedures. The correlations among percentage open wounds, MEE's, CEE's, and MCEE's were low. UUN excretions were not correlated with percentage open wounds or with MEE's. Estimates of energy expenditures using the Curreri formula appear to be of limited usefulness in prescribing caloric intakes in burned patients. Serial UUN's are useful in determining protein requirements, but were not correlated with MEE's or with the extent of open wounds.\r"

Seventeen patients with ureteral calculi too large to be extracted directly, who were unable to be treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or who otherwise would have required transureteral or percutaneous ultrasonic stone removal, underwent attempted stone fragmentation by pulsed dye laser application.

Routine screening during the latter period significantly increased the percentage of patients with clinically curable carcinoma of the prostate. Pathologically, the disease was upstaged in many patients in both series. Digital rectal examination can have a significant impact on early detection of carcinoma of the prostate within a given population but it cannot be interpreted as a panacea for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 102 consecutive patients with surgically staged, clinically localized prostatic carcinoma was performed to determine the relationship between pre-treatment enzymatic acid phosphatase values and histopathological extent of the tumor. Of 96 patients with normal pretreatment acid phosphatase titers (thymolphthalein monophosphate substrate) 77 (80 per cent) had values in the lower and 19 (20 per cent) had values in the upper half of the normal range. Of the latter 19 patients 16 (84 per cent) had histological evidence of extraprostatic tumor extension. Similarly, 5 of 6 patients (83 per cent) with elevated pre-treatment acid phosphatase titers had extraprostatic extension and 1 had a persistent postoperative acid phosphatase elevation that normalized with megestrol acetate therapy. Thus, 22 of 25 patients (88 per cent) with acid phosphatase values in or above the upper half of the normal range had either histological or clinical evidence of extracapsular tumor extension. By contrast, 41 of the 77 patients (53 per cent) with acid phosphatase titers in the lower half of the normal range had extracapsular extension. The predictive value for extraprostatic tumor extension of an acid phosphatase level in the upper half of the normal range was 84 per cent. Furthermore, in the 96 patients with normal acid phosphatase titers the incidence of extraprostatic tumor extension was significantly greater (p less than 0.01, chi-square) in those with values in the upper rather than the lower half of the normal range. Acid phosphatase titers in the upper half of the normal range were proportionately more common among patients with high grade and high clinical stage tumors. However, among patients with low grade and low stage tumors an acid phosphatase value in the upper half of the normal range was an independent variable that correlated with the presence of extracapsular tumor extension. These results confirm previously reported adverse prognostic implications of enzymatic acid phosphatase titers in or above the upper half of the normal range.\r"

  ".W": "Prostate specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase antigen and acid phosphatase activity were measured on 175 serum samples serially collected from 80 patients with metastatic stage D adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase antigen concentrations were measured with a monoclonal radioimmunometric assay, and acid phosphatase activity was measured enzymatically. The over-all frequency of abnormal levels of prostate specific antigen (76 per cent) was significantly greater than abnormal prostatic acid phosphatase antigen (60 per cent) and acid phosphatase activity (49 per cent) results (p less than 0.001). These differences were greater among the subset of patients in clinical remission. Levels greater than 10 times normal were observed in 68 per cent of prostate specific antigen, 43 per cent of prostatic acid phosphatase antigen and 31 per cent of acid phosphatase activity measurements (p less than 0.001). Three or more serial prostate specific antigen measurements in 17 patients demonstrated excellent correlation with independently assessed clinical disease activity. These results suggest that prostate specific antigen is a more sensitive and potentially more useful tumor marker than acid phosphatase measurements in patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 25 patients with histologically proved adenocarcinoma of the prostate, whose disease was staged clinically as D2 by appropriate radiographic and nuclear medicine studies, received increasing doses of PAY 276, an antiprostatic acid phosphatase monoclonal antibody for radioimmunological imaging. The patients were divided into 5 groups of 5. Groups 1 through 5 received an infusion of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg. monoclonal antibody, respectively, 1 mg. of which was labeled to 5 mCi. of 111indium, while stable monoclonal antibody was added to achieve the desired antibody concentration. No patient had an allergic reaction, and no significant change in serial hemoglobin levels, platelet count, chemistry profile or results of urinalyses was noted. The monoclonal antibody scan visualized at least 1 lesion in 19 of 25 patients (76 per cent): 4 in groups 1 and 2, and all 15 in groups 3 to 5. With results of conventional radiography and bone scintigraphy considered definitive for metastases, monoclonal antibody scans detected 7 of 32 metastases (21.8 per cent) in group 3 (20 mg.), 31 of 58 (53.4 per cent) in group 4 (40 mg.) and 101 of 134 (75.4 per cent) in group 5 (80 mg). In group 5 the incidence of false positive and false negative scans was 2.3 per cent (3 of 132) and 24.6 per cent (33 of 134), respectively. The detection of metastatic lesions increased as the concentration of unlabeled monoclonal antibody increased. Radioimmunological imaging of prostatic cancer with antiprostatic acid phosphatase monoclonal antibody seems to be feasible.\r"

The method described has not only led to major improvement in the presentation and accuracy of these tests but for the first time urethral profilometry has been adapted to detect sphincter incompetence and obstruction in 1 simple method. The fluid bridge test was performed on 46 men and 18 women. The results suggested that this test was excellent for urodynamic evaluation of retrograde ejaculation, post-prostatectomy incontinence and vesicourethral neuropathy, and its value was confirmed in women with stress incontinence. Micturitional urethral pressure profiles were performed in 38 men and 2 women. Not only was this test found to correlate well with conventional methods of detecting obstruction but it was able to diagnose urinary outflow obstruction in patients with equivocal pressure/flow studies and patients with acontractile detrusors. It also allowed diagnosis of the site of obstruction in men with vesicourethral neuropathy without the need for radiological screening.\r"

  ".W": "The selective 5-HT2 receptor blocker ketanserin was found to reduce maximal urethral pressures in healthy females by about 40% without reducing blood pressure. In vitro, ketanserin completely or almost completely reduced contractions of the isolated female rabbit urethra induced by phenylephrine, noradrenaline (NA) and electrical field stimulation. The drug was less effective against responses evoked by clonidine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). 5-HT-induced contractions were effectively reduced by methysergide, but little affected by prazosin and rauwolscine. In concentrations exceeding 10(-7) M ketanserin significantly increased efflux of 3H in 3H-NA preloaded preparations of rabbit urethral muscle. Low concentrations of 5-HT, less than 10(-6) M, had slight inhibitory effects of 3H release, whereas 5-HT 10(-5) M caused a significant increase. It is concluded that ketanserin counteracts the effects of postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in isolated rabbit urethra. Such an effect might also explain its urethral pressure lowering action in man.\r"

The limitations of pathologic grading systems may result from the failure of standard pathological examination of fixed dead tissue to accurately assess the biological behavior of live tumor cells. Many of the sublines of the Dunning R-3327 rat adenocarcinoma are histologically similar yet differ widely in their metastatic potential. The nonmetastatic G, occasionally metastatic AT-1 and AT-2, and highly metastatic AT-3 and MAT-Lu Dunning sublines, and normal dorsal prostate were grown in culture and filmed by time-lapse videomicroscopy. Cell membrane ruffling, undulation and pseudopodal extension, vectoral translation, irregularity of pathway, and overall subjective motility (gestalt) were visually graded. Intra-assay, intra-observer, and inter-observer reproducibility were 75, 80 and 75% respectively. The combination of ruffling, pseudopodal extension and vectoral translation was most successful in identifying the six sublines. To validate this technique prospectively, five tumor sublines and two normal prostates were graded by 10 observers unfamiliar with the technique. Fifty-nine percent of unknowns were correctly identified when motility profiles were compared to previously developed standards by least sum of squares analysis. We devised a new technique for characterizing the motility of living prostate cells which was more accurate in identifying normal rat prostate and the Dunning sublines than standard pathological examination. Prostatic cancer cell motility may reflect biological behavior and metastatic potential and thus contribute to the assessment of an individual patient's prognosis.\r"

The cells have been kept in culture for three years and produce human chorionic gonadotropin persistently. The chromosome number distribution ranged from tetraploidy to septaploidy, and trypsin G-band karyotyping showed that all the chromosomes were of human origin. Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate at a concentration of 1 mM caused more than 15-fold stimulation of human chorionic gonadotropin secretion with morphological alteration in JHTK-1 cells. This suggests that dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate induces the differentiation of cytotrophoblastic cells into syncytiotrophoblastic cells among JHTK-1 cells. When JHTK-1 cells were heterotransplanted into the subcutis of BALB/c nude mice, large cystic tumors were produced with histological characteristics similar to choriocarcinoma.\r"

Regarding the absolute amounts of the glandular and stromal parts of the prostate as well as the glandular cells, no difference was found among the testosterone, 3 alpha-androstanediol and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone treated castrated dogs. Treatment with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or 3 alpha-androstanediol in combination with 17 beta-estradiol induced a four-fold increase in glandular and a two-fold increase in stromal tissue. The glandular to stromal tissue ratio equals that found in spontaneous canine hyperplasia, which is indicative of the glandular type of spontaneous canine hyperplasia. Therefore, it can be stated that treatment with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or 3 alpha-androstanediol combined with 17 beta-estradiol not only induces prostatic overgrowth but also leads to prostatic hyperplasia of the glandular type. However, the stereologic analysis of canine prostates following steroid administration shows that canine hyperplasia is primarily a glandular disease, while human benign prostatic hyperplasia shows more stromal activation.\r"

  ".W": "In previous light and electron-microscopic analyses human benign prostatic hyperplasia was shown to be predominantly a stromal disease; the aim of the present study was to correlate the stereological data with the levels of the endogenous tissue hormones (androgens, estrogens, progesterone) in normal (N) and hyperplastic human prostatic tissues (BPH). BPH tissue specimens were obtained by open prostatectomy (n = 25); normal prostatic tissue was obtained from kidney donors (n = 5). No statistically significant difference was found between normal and hyperplastic tissue. Testosterone BPH 0.69 +/- 0.44, N 0.25 +/- 0.12; 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone BPH 7.0 +/- 2.9, N 4.2 +/- 0.7; progesterone BPH 0.059 +/- 0.022, N 0.058 +/- 0.005; estrone BPH 0.10 +/- 0.03, N 0.14 +/- 0.03; estradiol BPH 0.07 +/- 0.02, N 0.05 +/- 0.02; estriol BPH 0.02 +/- 0.01, N 0.04 +/- 0.02. Using a Spearman rank correlation coefficient a statistical analysis was performed for age, weight of the prostate, absolute stereological data and the endogenous prostatic hormones. As can be seen from the statistical analysis there is a poor correlation for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and the amount of the glandular epithelium; otherwise no correlation of the endogenous tissue hormones with the stereological data investigated was found. These data show that the stromal overgrowth of benign hyperplasia is not reflected in the tissue hormone levels.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic innervation of human prostate adenomas has been previously demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy and in vitro isometric studies. A clinical implication of these observations is that bladder outlet obstruction in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy may be subject to pharmacologic manipulation using adrenergic drugs. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of alpha adrenergic antagonists for symptomatic BPH. We have previously characterized the alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic receptors in the human prostate using [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine, respectively. The mean alpha1 and alpha2 receptor densities in the adenomas studied were equivalent. The effect of alpha2 adrenergic drugs on prostatic urethral pressure has not been examined in the human or in an animal model. In this study a canine model was used to define the effect of alpha2 drugs on prostatic urethral pressure. Intravenous administration of clonidine, a selective alpha2 agonist, resulted in a dose dependent increase in prostatic urethral pressure. The maximal increase in urethral pressure ranged between 18 to 30 cm. H2O. The maximal response to clonidine was approximately 50% less than the response to epinephrine, indicating that clonidine acts as a partial agonist. Pretreatment with yohimbine, a selective alpha2 adrenergic antagonist, abolished the effects of clonidine and epinephrine. The alpha2 adrenergic receptors were then studied in the canine prostates using [3H]rauwolscine. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, ranged between 0.68 to 1.80 nM and the receptor density ranged between 14.8 to 69.3 fmol./mg. protein. The receptor density was homogeneous in specimens obtained from the proximal, midportion, and distal canine prostate suggesting that the effect of alpha2 drugs is not sphincter mediated. These in vitro and in vivo studies provide the basis for investigating the effects of alpha2 antagonists in men with symptomatic BPH.\r"

Contralateral GFR showed a modest increase consistent with compensatory hypertrophy. The urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), the stable metabolite of the vasoconstrictor prostaglandin, thromboxane A2 (TxA2) was significantly elevated in the urine obtained following release of the obstructed ureter when compared to the TxB2 level in the urine from the contralateral kidney. Continuous infusion of OKY-046 at 100 micrograms./kg./min. over 24 hours during UUO decreased TxB2 excretion by greater than 80 per cent. However there was no significant preservation of RBF or GFR of the obstructed kidney following ureteral release despite the selective inhibition of TxA2. Moreover the increase in contralateral GFR was also abolished. Taken together with other studies these results strongly suggest that the potent vasoconstrictor TxA2 is not responsible for the rise in renal resistance that follows acute UUO.\r"

Routine coronary angiography and prophylactic myocardial revascularization for all significant lesions, regardless of symptoms, have been recommended as a means of reducing this mortality risk. We have advocated a more selective approach in which coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization are performed on the basis of cardiac symptoms. Studies have shown that this selective approach is just as effective as the prophylactic approach in reducing perioperative deaths. To evaluate the effect on late survival of selective myocardial revascularization on the basis of symptoms, we reviewed the preoperative coronary status and course of 485 patients who successfully underwent AAA repair between 1980 and 1985. Late survival was evaluated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with life expectancy of an age- and sex-matched population. Late survival of the entire group of patients was no different from that of the matched population. Patients with no preoperative evidence of coronary artery disease did significantly better than expected (p = 0.05), whereas those patients with uncorrected or previously bypassed coronary disease had survival no different from that expected. When age was considered as a variable, patients in their 50s and 60s had survival significantly worse than the matched population (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Patients in their 70s and 80s had survival as good as or better than the matched population, regardless of coronary status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition to obtaining a history and physical examination specific for disordered erectile function and vascular risk factors, we developed a sequence of testing to include noninvasive estimates of penile perfusion, pulse volume recording (PVR), and penile/brachial blood pressure indices (PBPI); somatosensory evoked potentials from dorsal penile (PEP) and posterior tibial nerve stimulation (SEP) and bulbocavernosus reflex time (BCR); stimulation of artificial erection with injection of papaverine (AE); and selective hypogastric-pudendal arteriography with patients under epidural anesthesia, and corpus cavernosography with AE. Three hundred fifty-three men complaining of impotence were screened by PVR and PBPI; among these 42 impotent men and 20 additional concurrent potent control subjects had evoked potentials and BCR measurements, and 55 men received one or more AE injections. On the basis of these results, angiographic investigation was recommended. Age and risk factors were similar in the two groups. Abnormal penile blood perfusion was associated significantly only with cigarette smoking (p less than 0.0001) or overt large vessel disease. Impotent men with (138) or without perfusion abnormalities (215) averaged 54 and 56 years of age, respectively; impotent men with normal flow patterns most commonly had treated hypertension or diabetes (79 of 215 men). Covert neurologic abnormalities were detected in 28 of 42 impotent men. Abnormal penile perfusion plus failure of AE predicted isolated ischiopudendal trunk or pudendal artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident following cardiac surgery was 1.9% in those patients with no carotid disease and 9.2% in those patients with carotid lesions. The incidence of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident in 32 patients with inoperable (occluded) carotid vessels was 15.6% and in 121 patients with operable (stenotic) lesions was 7.4%. In the group of patients with stenosis, 57 patients underwent carotid operation with an 8.8% incidence of neurologic deficit. During the last 1 1/2 years, no patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis underwent simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery. Four of 64 patients with combined lesions but no carotid surgery (6.3%) had a neurologic deficit, one of which was severe and permanent. The highest incidence of neurologic dysfunction occurred in patients with unilateral occlusions and contralateral stenosis. Four of 12 patients in this group had a deficit (three of seven patients underwent operation; one of five did not), one of which was permanent. The operative mortality rate after cardiac surgery was three times higher in patients with carotid disease than in those patients with normal carotid arteries. Combined carotid and coronary surgery is currently reserved for patients with neurologic symptoms and severe cardiac disease.\r"

In addition to the standard evaluation of these patients, we have used stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic mapping of cerebral blood flow (Xe/CT CBF). This relatively new and potentially widely available CBF methodology, by measuring approximately 30,000 CBF values within each of three CT levels, provides a readily interpretable means of evaluating extremes of hemodynamic compromise within any or all vascular territories. In the past 30 months, Xe/CT CBF studies in 300 patients with occlusive vascular disease have identified nine patients with global low flow and nonhemispheric symptoms (vertigo, lightheadedness, and/or blurred vision). Blood pressures determined by ocular pneumoplethysmography of Gee were markedly abnormal with reduced ocular/brachial ratios. Each patient had a combination of both segmental carotid and vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. Each patient had a flow-augmenting procedure performed on the anterior circulation in an attempt to improve global flow: carotid endarterectomy (two patients), subclavian-external carotid bypass (one patient), and superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass (six patients). In each case disabling transient symptoms were relieved. There were no operative deaths, but one stroke occurred, probably as a result of a brief period of postoperative hypotension. Postoperative Xe/CT CBF studies show a long-term improved global CBF in all patients.\r"

Forty-three failures occurred in 199 femoral-above-knee-popliteal bypasses (F-AKP), 33 failures in 177 femoral-below-knee-popliteal bypasses (F-BKP), 52 failures in 182 femorodistal bypasses (F-D), 28 failures in 85 axillofemoral bypasses (Ax-F), and nine failures in 81 femorofemoral bypasses (F-F). Our reoperative approach consisted of dissection of the distal anastomosis, longitudinal incision in the hood of the graft directly over the anastomosis, and proximal graft thrombectomy. Intimal hyperplasia was treated by patch angioplasty, proximal or distal progression of atherosclerosis was treated by a graft extension, and thrombectomy alone was performed when no cause of graft failure was identified. More recently, a totally new bypass was constructed in 27 cases of F-BKP or F-D failures. Reoperations featuring graft salvage for failed extra-anatomic and F-AKP bypasses yielded 3-year patency rates from the time of first reoperation of 71% and 52%, respectively, whereas for F-BKP and F-D reoperations, 3-year patency rates were 13% and 15%, respectively, at 3 years. However, totally new grafts to a different outflow artery in these settings had 3-year patency rates of 48% and 39%. These data support the aggressive use of reoperation with graft salvage when F-AKP or extra-anatomic graft failure reproduces critical ischemia. Conversely, a new bypass to a virginal outflow site, preferably with autologous vein, should be performed when a polytetrafluoroethylene F-BKP or F-D bypass fails.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that standard knitted and woven fabric grafts are forever dependent on the suture material for anastomotic tensile strength. Clinical experience with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and double velour knitted grafts have shown that there is extensive fibrous capsular bonding between the graft and the surrounding tissues. This would lead to increased anastomotic tensile strength. To test this theory, 34 mongrel dogs underwent replacement of their infrarenal aortas with grafts made of PTFE (10 dogs), of double velour knitted Dacron (DVD, 11 dogs), of single velour knitted Dacron (SVD, 5 dogs), and of woven Dacron (WD, 8 dogs). One anastomosis was constructed with 5-0 Prolene and the opposite anastomosis was constructed with 5-0 Dexon (average absorption time, 21 days). In five grafts each of PTFE and DVD, as well as in all eight WD grafts, the midgraft was divided and resutured with 5-0 Dexon. All grafts were harvested together with adjacent proximal and distal aorta between 3 and 10 months from the time of implantation. The tensile strength of each anastomosis was measured with a tensiometer. The mean graft-to-artery (absorbable suture) anastomotic tensile strength, in pounds, for PTFE (14.3) and DVD (12.6) was significantly higher than that for SVD (6.9) or WD (7.2) (p less than 0.003). Graft-to-graft anastomotic tensile strength for PTFE (mean 17.3) was significantly better than that for DVD (mean 9.0; p less than 0.03) or WD (mean 7.9; p less than 0.001). Analysis of anastomotic tensile strength as a function of time revealed continued increase in PTFE in contrast to a slow decline with time in DVD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because infrainguinal bypasses performed on the basis of normal papaverine testing in patients with multilevel arterial occlusive disease are done below arteriographically diseased although hemodynamically normal vessels, there is concern about progression of suprainguinal disease compromising long-term success. This study has been done to assess the long-term results of such bypasses. Between 1979 and 1985, infrainguinal bypasses selected by papaverine testing were done on 92 limbs having hemodynamically normal inflow in the presence of arteriographically demonstrable aortoiliac stenoses of 15% to 70%. Long-term hemodynamic and clinical success rates were determined with criteria based on papaverine and noninvasive vascular testing. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic success at 48 months (by life-table analysis) (p = 0.98) when comparing limbs with less than 50% aortoiliac stenoses to limbs having 50% or greater stenoses. The difference between the mean degree of preoperative inflow stenoses for long-term hemodynamic successes (32.5% +/- 1.5%) and failures (34.6% +/- 3.0%) was not significant (p = 0.57). There was no significant difference (p = 0.98) in the number of subsequent inflow procedures required in limbs with preoperative aortoiliac stenoses of less than 50% (13.5%) vs. aortoiliac stenoses of 50% or greater (13.3%). Long-term results of infrainguinal bypass done below stenotic but hemodynamically normal aortoiliac vessels are not related to the amount of angiographically demonstrable inflow stenosis. Selection of patients for infrainguinal bypass on the basis of papaverine testing, irrespective of angiographic findings, eliminates unnecessary inflow procedures without detriment to long-term success.\r"

We have previously shown, with a carotid artery preparation isolated in situ with intact adventitia, that long-term cholesterol feeding in rabbits will result in a seven- to tenfold increase in 125I albumin transport across the artery into the systemic circulation. The current studies were undertaken to determine whether this abnormality of enhanced permeability could be reversed by cessation of cholesterol feeding and correction of the hyperlipidemia. Two groups of rabbits were fed either a standard Rabbit Chow or a diet containing 1.5% cholesterol and 5.2% corn oil for 12 to 15 weeks. Another group of rabbits was given cholesterol for 12 to 15 weeks with change to standard rabbit chow for an additional 22 to 24 weeks after which albumin transport studies were then performed. Mean plasma cholesterol level after 12 to 15 weeks of cholesterol feeding was 2052 +/- 395 mg/dl. After the animals were withdrawn from the cholesterol diet for 22 to 24 weeks, the mean plasma cholesterol level decreased to 80 +/- 21 mg/dl. The mean plasma cholesterol value in chow-fed animals was 39 +/- 6 mg/dl. Perfusion studies were done with 125I-labeled albumin and plasma radioactivity served as a measure of transport across the carotid artery. The average level of albumin transport across the artery into venous blood in the cholesterol-fed animals (13,911 dpm/ml of plasma) was significantly greater than that of control animals (2049 dpm/ml of plasma).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acute renal artery occlusion is an infrequently encountered entity, with a paucity of literature on which to form clinical decisions. During a 20-year period 35 patients were treated for acute renal artery occlusion as a result of embolism (13 patients), thrombosis of a stenosed vessel (16 patients), or trauma (six patients). Patients were treated operatively in 16 cases and nonoperatively in 19 cases. In patients with embolic occlusion, embolectomy was successful in the relief of hypertension but was ineffective in the restoration of renal function. In patients with thrombotic occlusion, thrombectomy and aortorenal bypass were successful in both the reduction of blood pressure and the retrieval of renal function. In this group, salvage was dependent on the presence of a reconstituted distal renal artery, irrespective of the operative delay. In patients with traumatic renal artery occlusion, return of renal function did not occur, despite reperfusion as early as 6 hours after injury. These data suggest that the period in which function of embolized or traumatized kidneys may be preserved has usually passed by the time the diagnosis of renal artery occlusion has been made. By contrast, operative therapy of thrombotic occlusion frequently results in return of renal function, irrespective of the delay in treatment.\r"

Resting supine tcPO2 levels of 20 mm Hg or less at the foot were noted in all patients in this study (normal values 60.10 +/- 6.82 mm Hg). Group I patients were defined by an increase of less than 15 mm Hg on standing, whereas group II patients showed an increase of 15 mm Hg or more. Group I patients had a supine tcPO2 value of 4.24 +/- 5.31 mm Hg, with an increase of 3.91 +/- 4.59 mm Hg on standing. The group II subjects also had a low supine tcPO2 level, 5.73 +/- 4.98 mm Hg, but the increase on standing, 36.14 +/- 11.41 mm Hg, was significantly higher (p less than 0.001). When these levels increased by less than 15 mm Hg on standing in group I (31 patients), only 29% of limbs (10 of 34) were saved or had patent grafts at 3 months and 55% of attempted vascular reconstructions (11 of 20) failed. Amputations were performed in 50% of the limbs (17 of 34). This contrasted in group II (69 patients) with a significantly higher limb salvage and graft patency rate (81%, 57 of 70 limbs), success of reconstruction (79%, 37 of 47 procedures), and a significantly lower rate of amputation (11%, 8 of 70 limbs) (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine optimal methods of reoperation, experience with 157 secondary procedures for unilateral aortofemoral graft limb occlusion in 110 patients during a 16-year period was reviewed. In earlier years, inflow was reestablished by direct replacement of the graft limb or entire graft (11%); more recently, graft limb thrombectomy has been used most frequently (68%) with equal success, durability, and less morbidity. Femorofemoral grafts from the patent contralateral graft limb were employed in 18% of patients, usually those in whom thrombectomy was not attempted. Thrombolytic therapy (3%) appears to offer little advantage, is time-consuming, and occasionally causes significant complications. In addition to reestablishment of inflow, most patients also required revision of the femoral anastomosis to improve profunda femoris runoff; this was usually best accomplished by short segmental extension of the graft limb to the more distal deep femoral artery. Concomitant femoropopliteal bypass was done in 32% of patients and is indicated when preoperative angiography or specific intraoperative findings suggest inadequate profunda femoris outflow. An aggressive approach to reoperation appeared justified by long-term results (mean follow-up 37 months). Despite the need for repetitive reoperation in 26% of patients (two to five reoperations), graft limb patency was ultimately maintained in 78% and limb salvage achieved in 67% of patients, with an operative mortality rate of only 1.9%.\r"

Data were generated from denervated isoperfused small intestinal preparations. Arterial pressure, venous pressure, and oxygen consumption were continuously monitored. Determinations of intestinal blood flow allowed calculation of mesenteric vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. Animals underwent stepwise reductions in arterial pressure and acute venous hypertension (10 to 15 mm Hg). There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic or metabolic parameters in control (C) or digitalized (D) animals. Blood flow and oxygen consumption were autoregulated in both C and D rats until perfusion pressure decreased below 50 mm Hg. The response to acute venous hypertension was different. In D rats, venous hypertension resulted in increased vascular resistance (millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute per 100 gm) [0.89 +/- 0.05 to 0.97 +/- 0.07; p less than 0.05], whereas C rats demonstrated no change [0.92 +/- 0.08 to 0.95 +/- 0.09]. The decrease in oxygen consumption in D rats (-14%) was slightly but significantly greater than that observed in C rats (-9%). Digitalized rats demonstrated a heightened myogenic response to acute venous hypertension with deleterious effects on vascular resistance and oxygen consumption. This reaction was intrinsic to the mesenteric circulation and not mediated by sympathetic nerves or central reflexes. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in digitalized patients may reflect a similar abnormal response to the acute increases in portal pressure accompanying cardiac failure.\r"

In this study we compared the degree of EC coverage and the early SMC-PR in the arterial segments proximal and distal to 2 mm diameter PTFE grafts that had been placed in rabbit carotid arteries (n = 49). In vivo labeling with 3H-thymidine and Evans blue was carried out at intervals of 2 to 33 days after grafting. The SMC-PR was measured as the degree of 3H-labeled DNA divided by the total DNA for each segment, and the EC coverage was determined by planimetry of the area of Evans blue exclusion. There was an early rise in the SMC-PR in both arterial segments, but it was more marked in the distal segment (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the SMC-PR and the degree of EC coverage in either the proximal (r = 0.25) or the distal segments (r = 0.10). The data suggest that there is a greater SMC-PR at the distal end of an implanted PTFE graft. The degree of endothelial loss and its regrowth does not appear to be an important factor.\r"

Thirty-three (94%) of the recipient cases, 41 (82%) of the contact cases, and five (36%) of the immune deficient cases were associated with the first dose of OPV. The overall frequency of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis was one case per 2.6 million doses distributed. However, the relative frequency of paralysis associated with the first dose in the OPV series was one case per 520,000 doses vs one case per 12.3 million subsequent doses. Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis is rare and the risks of OPV are small. The greatest likelihood of paralysis occurs in association with the first dose of OPV and that likelihood is reduced in subsequent doses more for recipients than for their contacts.\r"

Among these completing the trial, diarrhea (four or more unformed stools in 24 hours or three in eight hours, plus one other symptom) occurred in seven (14%) of 51 receiving the high-dose regimen compared with 15 (24%) of 63 receiving the low-dose regimen and 23 (40%) of 58 in the placebo group. Protection rates were 65% for high-dose and 40% for low-dose bismuth subsalicylate. Diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was found in one student receiving the high-dose regimen, in no students receiving the low-dose regimen, and in seven placebo-treated subjects. Bismuth subsalicylate was well tolerated; the most common side effects were blackening of tongues and stools. Bismuth subsalicylate use in both dosages was associated with tinnitus at a low, clinically insignificant frequency of 1.2 days per 100 days of treatment. The dosage of two tablets of bismuth subsalicylate four times daily (2.1 g/d) appears to be a safe and effective means of reducing the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea among persons at risk for periods up to three weeks.\r"

Clinical studies indicate that mild local and febrile reactions are less frequent after administration of acellular pertussis vaccines than after whole-cell vaccines. Serious adverse events with sequelae occurred in 2-year-old children at approximately the same low rate during the period 1975 through August 1981, when whole-cell vaccines were used, and during August 1981 through 1984, when acellular vaccines were used exclusively. Five household contact studies have yielded vaccine efficacy estimates ranging from 78% to 92% in children 1 year of age or older. In addition, there has been a continuing decrease in reported pertussis incidence from the epidemic peak in 1979. Additional data on the safety and efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccines administered to infants would be useful in consideration of acellular pertussis vaccine licensure in the United States.\r"

The Framingham Heart Study provides an opportunity for long-term observation of antihypertensive medication use by a group of hypertensive subjects. While 801 (70%) of the 1138 cohort members taking such medication at two consecutive biennial examinations continued to receive medication until death or the end of observation, 242 subjects (21%) had blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg and 95 subjects (8%) were normotensive at the first examination while not receiving medication. The 95 normotensive subjects had lower pretreatment blood pressure and a greater proportion with controlled blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 years after first medication use than those in the first two groups. Eleven of these 95 subjects maintained good blood pressure control while not receiving medication for at least four years, including one subject who continued not to receive medication for 12 years. While virtually all hypertensive subjects eventually relapse, a small group may experience a period of remission of hypertension while not receiving medication. As further studies permit more specific identification of individuals who will do well while not receiving medication, guidelines for medical care of hypertensive persons will need to be updated.\r"

We studied falls and fractures in 157 ATD patients, including 117 with three-year follow-up. Initially all but one patient could walk; 31% reported falls. During follow-up, 50% either fell or became unable to walk. The fracture rate during follow-up (69/1000/y) was more than three times the age- and sex-adjusted fracture rate in the general population. Features of both ATD and comorbid conditions contributed to the risk of falls and fractures. In particular, patients who experienced toxic reactions to drugs on entry into the study were more likely to report they had fallen prior to entry (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.78 to 13.3), and patients who wandered were more likely to sustain fractures (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 10.4) during the follow-up period, including hip fractures for which the odds ratio of 6.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.66 to 28.6) was unexpectedly high. Preventive measures may be possible, including controlling wandering, avoiding toxic reactions to drugs, and treating comorbid illnesses.\r"

To examine the roles of the magnitude of change in hemoglobin concentration and the individual's initial aerobic fitness in this effect, we combined individual data from our own research and three other studies. In each study freeze-preserved erythrocytes from the product of 2 units of blood were reinfused, and maximal oxygen uptake was measured within 24 to 72 hours after reinfusion. The 30 subjects had an initial aerobic power of 36 to 88 mL of oxygen per kilogram per minute. The combined results from these studies indicate that after erythrocyte reinfusion the increase in hemoglobin concentration is fairly homogeneous (mean +/- SD, 1.36 +/- 0.6 g/dL [13.6 +/- 6 g/L]), nearly all individuals demonstrate an increase in maximal oxygen uptake (0.357 +/- 0.216 L/min), the magnitude of increase in hemoglobin concentration is not related to the magnitude of increase in maximal oxygen uptake, and the magnitude of increase in maximal oxygen uptake is related to the individual's initial aerobic fitness. Individuals with an initial aerobic fitness between 50 and 65 mL X kg-1 X min-1 experience approximately twice the increase in maximal oxygen uptake after erythrocyte reinfusion of individuals with greater fitness and also of lesser fitness.\r"

Following its emergency classification in Schedule 1 by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985, 3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDEA, \"Eve\") has appeared as MDMA's legal replacement. MDMA is thought to be safe by recreational users and by psychotherapists who support its use. The details of five deaths associated with the use of MDMA and MDEA are reported. In three patients, MDMA or MDEA may have contributed to death by the induction of arrhythmias in individuals with underlying natural disease. In another patient, use of MDMA preceded an episode of bizarre and risky behavior that resulted in accidental death. In another patient, MDMA was thought to be the immediate cause of death. Death as a consequence of the use of these drugs appears to be rare, but it does occur; this outcome may be more common in individuals with underlying cardiac disease.\r"

Two dilatation balloons were used in which the diameters approximately equaled the mitral valve anulus diameter as determined. After CBV, the mean mitral valve gradient decreased in all patients (mean +/- SD, 16 +/- 6 to 5 +/- 2 mm Hg), the mean left atrial pressure decreased (29 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg), and the cardiac output increased (4.4 +/- 1.2 to 5.5 +/- 1.4 L/min). The mitral valve area increased from 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.8 cm2. Oximetry demonstrated small left to right shunts of pulmonary to systemic flow ratios of 1.4:1 and 1.3:1 in two patients. Mitral regurgitation did not increase. Gradual decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance were recorded over the subsequent 24 hours. Our patients left the hospital two days after CBV. The New York Heart Association Functional Class improved in 11 of 12 patients. We conclude that CBV using the double-balloon technique effectively relieves mitral valve obstruction, reduces elevated pulmonary pressures, and reduces symptoms in selected adult patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis.\r"

In most of the patients who were incontinent while hospitalized, incontinence was a persistent phenomenon and had been present before hospitalization and was present afterward. Only 5% had \"transient\" or \"nosocomial\" incontinence. These data suggest that the acute-care hospital may provide a good opportunity for physicians to identify the often-ignored problem of incontinence, and to then initiate an appropriate diagnostic evaluation of this condition if it persists after hospital discharge.\r"

After a four-week baseline period of weekly blood pressure measurement, subjects were randomly assigned within racial groups to either a treatment (calcium, 1500 mg/d) or placebo group for a 12-week period. During the experimental period, multiple blood pressure measurements were taken every two weeks in both the seated and supine positions, using a random baseline sphygmomanometer. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance yielded a modest but significantly lower seated mean arterial pressure in the treatment group compared with the control group, but no differences between the races. Results were similar for supine blood pressure. Calcium supplementation, in comparison with placebo, resulted in lower mean arterial pressure in normotensive white and black men during a 12-week period. The overall blood pressure-lowering effect was not correlated with the response of serum levels of total and ionized calcium, total inorganic phosphorus, or parathyroid hormone, or overnight urinary electrolyte values.\r"

Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barre syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1985 and May 1986, following completion of a pilot study, a main study concerning the possible association between Reye's syndrome and salicylates was conducted. Twenty-seven patients with stage II or deeper Reye's syndrome whose diagnoses were confirmed by an expert panel and who had appropriate antecedent illnesses (chickenpox, respiratory illness, or gastrointestinal illness) prior to the onset of Reye's syndrome were compared with 140 controls matched for age, race (black or not black), and type and timing of onset of antecedent illness. Controls were selected from the same hospital, emergency room, or school as case-patients or were identified by random-digit telephone dialing. As in the pilot study, a strong statistical association with ingestion of salicylates during the antecedent illness and prior to the onset of Reye's syndrome was observed (odds ratio, 40; lower 95% confidence limit, 5.8). Analysis of the independent risk of aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates revealed a significant association with aspirin (odds ratio, 26; lower 95% confidence limit, 6.4); the independent risk of nonaspirin salicylates could not be assessed because only two cases were not exposed to aspirin. Assessment of epidemiologic issues of concern, including case-control differences in the severity of the antecedent illness, did not explain the high odds ratios that were observed. The high percentage of patients with Reye's syndrome exposed to salicylates (greater than or equal to 90%) in this and prior studies suggests that, though the reported incidence of Reye's syndrome has declined in recent years, concomitant with a decline in salicylate use among children, a majority of Reye's syndrome cases may be attributable to salicylate use.\r"

Although only 16.7% of these families had all members with a majority of their visits to the same physician, 45.4% identified a single primary care physician for all family members. (For older couples, this percentage reached 73.5%). An intermediate proportion of families had visits by all family members to a single physician. Children received less family care, but as families matured, family care increased for both children and parents. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between family care and education level. The availability of general-family practitioners, family income, insurance coverage, and population size were not significant determinants of family care. We conclude that family members share the perception of having a single \"family physician,\" which is reflected in their patterns of utilization.\r"

Therefore, to determine smokers' perceptions of physician involvement in smoking cessation, we analyzed aggregate data from two random statewide surveys of 5875 Michigan adults. Of smokers who had seen a physician in the previous year, only 44% reported that they had ever been told to quit smoking by a physician. Young male smokers were the least likely (30%) to have been told to quit. Smokers who were hypertensive, obese, diabetic, sedentary, or users of oral contraceptives were no more likely to have been told to quit than smokers without these additional cardiovascular risks. Conversely, smokers who had survived a myocardial infarction or stroke were more likely to have been told to quit than smokers who had not suffered these events (73% vs 43%). Most smokers do not perceive physicians to be even minimally involved in their efforts to quit. Physicians need to increase their efforts in counseling smokers to quit before smoking-related diseases result, especially for smokers with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\r"

A review of a teaching hospital's four years' experience showed two deaths (2% incidence) due to inappropriate use. Colchicine has the smallest benefit-to-toxicity ratio of drugs that are effective for acute gout.

In one patient, successful coronary bypass surgery resulted in the elimination of exercise-induced painless myocardial ischemia and associated ventricular fibrillation; the other patient suffered a myocardial infarction after which ischemia and ventricular tachyarrhythmias could not be reproduced with exercise testing. We conclude that painless myocardial ischemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias and is, therefore, a potentially lethal phenomenon.\r"

Because of these possibilities, we investigated the relationship between overall nutritional status in CF with measures of selenium nutriture. Fifteen stable outpatients with CF (group I) were compared to 13 age-matched controls (group II) and 27 healthy adults (group III). Whole blood, plasma, and red blood cell selenium levels were reduced by 31%, 29%, and 33%, respectively, in CF patients vs controls (all p less than 0.001). In addition, both groups I and II showed significantly lower blood selenium levels than healthy adults (p less than 0.005). Nutritional assessment revealed CF patients to be undernourished, with significant decreases in serum albumin (p less than 0.025), weight-for-height deficit (p less than 0.01), and weight-for-age (p less than 0.025) vs controls. However, only the triceps skinfold (TSF) measurement correlated significantly with selenium status (r = 0.56: p less than 0.05 for whole blood selenium vs TSF). We conclude, based on the magnitude of decrement in blood selenium, that it is unlikely that selenium plays a significant primary pathogenic role in cystic fibrosis. However, these patients are at high risk for developing clinical selenium deficiencies. The measurement of blood selenium levels using appropriate age-matched normal standards should be mandatory in all CF patients with malnutrition, or in those requiring parenteral nutritional support.\r"

The emulsion tested was Lipofundin MCT 10%. One half of its triglyceride mass contains medium chain fatty acids. The IVFTT was started by injection of 0.1 g lipid per kg body weight into the fasting proband. Lipid elimination was estimated by measurement of light-scattering intensity of serum samples collected during a 60-min period. Individual fraction elimination rate constants covered a considerable range (K2 = 8.84 +/- 3.45%/min). The infusion test was performed at a rate of 0.1 g lipid per kg body weight and hr and lasted 6 hr. Serum triglyceride concentrations were determined enzymatically. They increased from 0.941 +/- 0.285 mmol/liter at the fasting state to a plateau level of 1.753 +/- 0.306 mmol/liter during infusion, and returned to initial levels 1 to 2 hr after the infusion was terminated. Individual triglyceride increments during infusion were significantly correlated with half-life periods of lipid elimination during IVFTT (r = 0.792, p less than 0.001). This relationship was derived using a model of the stationary state during infusion. We conclude that elimination kinetics of exogenous fat given either as bolus or infusion are ruled by the same fractional elimination rate constant K2. The IVFTT provides an estimate of the stationary triglyceride increment during a lipid infusion lasting several hr.\r"

A possibility not studied with regard to guar gum, but previously demonstrated to be important in absorption, is the effect of change in the unstirred water layer. As the unstirred water layer increases in thickness, the rate of absorption decreases for certain nutrients. The effect of guar gum on the unstirred water layer in the lumen of rabbit jejunum was examined by previously described techniques. It was observed that: increases in guar gum concentration resulted in an increased thickness of the unstirred water layer; for any stir rate, the addition of guar gum increased the thickness of the unstirred water layer; and stir rate is inversely related to the thickness of the unstirred water layer. It was concluded from these results that guar gum increases the thickness of the unstirred water layer in rabbit jejunum. This mechanism may explain, in part, the reduction of the rate of absorption of certain nutrients seen following guar gum ingestion.\r"

Study of these patients, and of four additional patients prospectively selected for study, demonstrated that three of five patients had higher peak and/or trough aminoglycoside serum concentrations--when blood was obtained from the central venous catheter--than were contained in simultaneous samples from peripheral blood; these divergent results were noted after the catheter had been in use for more than 1 week; divergent results were not improved by additional catheter flushing prior to central venous blood sampling. These observations suggest that spurious aminoglycoside serum concentration results may sometimes be obtained when blood sampling is performed from central venous Silastic catheters, and can result in improper drug dosage alterations. It is necessary to access the timing, processing, and reliability of serum drug-monitoring practices on a routine basis to preclude such problems, and to reassess individual patient-monitoring studies which are inconsistent with anticipated results.\r"

Illustrative cases are presented. To clarify further the nature of the SGA, the method was applied before gastrointestinal surgery to 202 hospitalized patients. The primary aim of the study was to determine the extent to which our clinician's SGA ratings were influenced by the individual clinical variables on which the clinicians were taught to base their assessments. Virtually all of these variables were significantly related to SGA class. Multivariate analysis showed that ratings were most affected by loss of subcutaneous tissue, muscle wasting, and weight loss. A high degree of interobserver agreement was found (kappa = 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.624 to 0.944, p less than 0.001). We conclude that SGA can easily be taught to a variety of clinicians (residents, nurses), and that this technique is reproducible.\r"

Complications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy are reviewed, and the problem of gastrocolic fistula formation secondary to gastrostomy placement is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The acute phase of glomerular injury in a model of antiglomerular basement membrane, antibody-induced glomerulonephritis (antiGBM-GN) in rabbits was shown to be neutrophil-dependent using nitrogen mustard depletion studies. Administration of desferrioxamine (DFX) prevented the development of proteinuria in this model of renal injury [24 hr protein excretion (mean +/- SEM): antiGBM-GN/DFX = 16.2 +/- 2.9 mg compared with antiGBM-GN control = 271.5 +/- 92.2 mg, P less than 0.01]. Antibody binding levels, glomerular filtration rates, circulating complement and neutrophil counts, glomerular C3 deposition, and neutrophil infiltration did not differ between DFX treated and antiGBM-GN groups. In vitro assay systems to assess oxygen radical production [superoxide anion (O2-) and hydroxyl radical (OH.)] by neutrophils activated via the interaction of antiGBM antibody, GBM and complement were established. In these assays, DFX inhibited OH. production by immunologically-stimulated neutrophils (ISN) [nM diphenol/hr/10(6) cells, mean +/- SEM, ISN/DFX = 8 +/- 2 compared with ISN = 191 +/- 22, P less than 0.01] while production of O2- was not affected [nM O2-/hr/10(6) cells, mean +/- SEM, ISN/DFX = 29.1 +/- 4.3 compared with ISN = 32.6 +/- 2.5, P greater than 0.05]. These studies demonstrate that the iron chelator desferrioxamine can prevent neutrophil-dependent immune renal injury by interfering with neutrophil function. Treatment with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea also significantly attenuated renal injury in antiGBM-GN. Together, the in vivo and in vitro data strongly suggest that neutrophil-dependent immunological renal injury is mediated via hydroxyl radical production by activated neutrophils within glomeruli.\r"

Proximal tubule lumens were blocked with a short column of wax using micropuncture. Chronically blocked and control (normal) tubules were fixed by either intravascular or intraluminal perfusion of glutaraldehyde solution. Proximal tubule segments downstream to the wax block were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Intraluminal Alcian blue dye, serial sectioning, and nephron microdissection techniques were used to identify nephrons. One day after obstruction, all proximal tubule cells downstream to the block were injured. Some recovery was seen. S1 and S2 segments showed more severe damage than S3 segments. Alcian blue, which normally is excluded from cells, entered the cytoplasm of some damaged S1-S2 cells. After one week of obstruction, the tubule appeared to have reconstituted itself, but cells were less differentiated than normal. One month after obstruction, blocked tubules were atrophied. Tubule cells were simplified and were surrounded by a thickened basement membrane. The results suggest that prolonged proximal tubule blockade produces injury and atrophy of the proximal tubule probably due to ischemia and interruption of normal reabsorptive activity.\r"

Administration of benzolamide (2 mg/kg/hr, i.v., Group 1, N = 7 rats) caused not only reduction in absolute rate of proximal fluid reabsorption (APR, from 26.7 +/- 4.0 nl/min to 17.7 +/- 3.6, P less than 0.001), but also an increase in peritubular transcapillary hydraulic-pressure difference (from 10.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg to 15.2 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.001). In a separate group of seven rats (Group 2), these parameters did not change significantly without benzolamide treatment. In Group 1 rats, an attempt was made to nullify the benzolamide-induced reduction in the peritubular capillary net reabsorptive forces by infusing hyperoncotic high-hematocrit blood. Following this treatment, while benzolamide administration was continued, values for APR returned to levels (25.6 +/- 4.8 nl/min) nearly identical to those measured prior to benzolamide administration, in association with a rise in peritubular transcapillary oncotic pressure difference. A separate group of six rats treated in a fashion identical to that of Group 1 showed continued suppression of carbonic anhydrase activity following blood infusion as indicated by low levels of whole kidney bicarbonate reabsorption rate. Peritubular capillary reabsorption coefficient was calculated based on the measured values for Starling forces in Group 1 and were unaffected throughout the study. Continued benzolamide administration alone without the treatment of hyperoncotic blood did not change APR significantly (Group 3, N = 7 rats).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87142514\r", 
  ".W": "Glomerular mesangial cells (MC) in culture are believed to contract or relax in response to agents such as angiotensin II and cyclic AMP. However, cells grown on glass or plastic surfaces are limited in their response to vasoactive agents because of the rigid surfaces to which they adhere; thus, interpretation of a change in shape as contraction, relaxation, or detachment is difficult. We have grown MC on a flexible silicone rubber (dimethylpolysiloxane) substrate (DMPS), and studied with sequential photographs several models of cell contraction, relaxation, and detachment. When the cells contracted, the DMPS became wrinkled; when the cells relaxed, the DMPS lost wrinkles. In contrast, if the cells detached, the sheet lost wrinkles as the cells became smaller and rounder. Angiotensin II (5 X 10(-7) M), and calcium ionophore A23187 (2 X 10(-6) M) increased wrinkles in more than 30% of cells at 22 degrees C and more than 40% of the cells at 36 degrees C. The earliest effect was visible within five to 10 minutes at 22 degrees C and within one minute at 36 degrees C and increased until 40 minutes; thereafter, the cells relaxed and wrinkles were reduced. 10(-1) M Na azide prevented the increase in wrinkles produced by angiotensin II. Seventy-two percent of the angiotensin II-treated cells whose margins could be seen in their entirety, and 78% of the calcium ionophore-treated cells showed a reduction in surface area at a time when new wrinkles were appearing or wrinkles were increasing in size. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a known smooth muscle relaxant, produced a decrease or loss of wrinkles in 90% of the cells, and an accompanying increase in surface area. Untreated control cells, observed in conjunction with the above series, showed little change in wrinkles. Ten percent DMSO, an actin-translocating agent, produced a reversible disappearance of wrinkles. These models of contraction and relaxation could be distinguished from cell detachment; EDTA, for example, in the presence of zero calcium, diminished both cell size and wrinkles, with an accompanying lifting of cells from the surface. Similar results were obtained with cytochalasin B and chlorpromazine. Thus, the silicone rubber system accurately reflects the contraction, relaxation and detachment of cultured mesangial cells in response to a variety of agents.\r"

We previously evaluated renal function and morphology in a unique strain of rats (LOU/m) bearing tumors which synthesized BJPs with isoelectric points of 5.2, 4.3 and 6.7. Myeloma cast nephropathy developed in one tumor bearing group (pI 5.2), tubular necrosis was observed in another (pI 4.3), and renal function and histology remained normal in a third group (pI 6.7). To see if these renal outcomes were a function of the BJP being excreted or other factors which could be present in the tumor bearing animals, we have examined the effect of chronic intravenous administration of these three BJPs on renal function and histology in non-tumor-bearing LOU/m rats. Urine containing the BJP was collected from tumor bearing rats, sterilized by passage through a 0.2 mu millipore filter, concentrated to 50 mg/ml, and dialyzed extensively so as to remove material with a molecular weight less than 3500. Chronic indwelling-venous catheters were placed in non-tumor-bearing LOU/m rats and these rats were given 100 mg/day for five days of one of the three BJPs. Polyfructosan clearance (Cin) was measured prior to and following the five days of BJP administration. Renal histology was examined at the completion of the second Cin. In the pI 5.2 group (N = 6), a severe distal nephron cast nephropathy occurred and Cin fell from 2.88 +/- 0.24 to 0.90 +/- 0.17 ml/min (P less than 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To see how chronic uremia affects R, 11/12 nephrectomized rats and sham-operated controls were fed a regular diet for 15 days and then given these isotopes p.o. Six hours later, R, measured in whole body protein, and in the protein of brain, heart, muscle, salivary gland, liver, and the kidney remnant was significantly greater than in sham-operated controls. The greatest difference (39%) was seen in liver protein and the smallest difference (19%) in muscle. Thus chronic uremia increases the efficiency, relative to leucine, with which KIC is utilized for protein synthesis in all of these organs and in the body as a whole. Possible explanations are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion-fixation and vascular casting were used to determine if angiotensin II and norepinephrine cause constriction of afferent arterioles, and if so, whether or not the constriction is principally attributable to a secondary (autoregulatory) response to elevated pressure in the renal circulation. Rats were divided into six groups, and were given five minute infusions of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or normal saline before perfusion-fixation. Angiotensin II infusions were given to animals in Groups 1 and 2; in Group 1 the renal circulation was exposed to elevated blood pressure, but in Group 2 intrarenal pressure was maintained at normal levels by partial ligation of the aorta above the renal arteries. Groups 3 and 4 were comparable to Groups 1 and 2 respectively, except that norepinephrine was infused instead of angiotensin II. Groups 5 and 6 received infusions of normal saline instead of vasopressor substances. In Group 5, renal vessels were perfusion-fixed at elevated pressures, while in Group 6 renal vessels were perfusion-fixed at normal pressures. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine and measure vascular casts of 40 to 50 afferent arterioles from each rat. In Groups 1 through 4, casts of afferent arterioles showed severe, focal, and irregularly distributed constriction. In Groups 5 and 6 there was no qualitative evidence of afferent arteriolar constriction or irregularities in vessel caliber. Vessel diameter measurements were significantly smaller in Groups 1 to 4 when compared to Groups 5 and 6, and arteriolar constriction in the juxtamedullary and cortical regions was quantitatively comparable in Groups 1 to 4. Arteriolar diameters in Group 5 were somewhat, but not significantly smaller than those in Group 6, suggesting that perfusion-fixation at elevated pressure alone may have made a minor contribution to afferent vasoconstriction. However, this constriction was clearly not of the same pattern or magnitude as that produced by angiotensin II or norepinephrine infusions. The results indicate that both angiotensin II and norepinephrine cause severe focal constriction of afferent arterioles, and that this constriction cannot be attributed primarily to a pressure-induced autoregulatory response in the renal vasculature.\r"

To clarify this phenomenon, the present study examined tubular H+ ion secretory capacity in an ischemic model of ARF. Clearance studies were performed in dogs subjected to 60 minutes, unilateral renal artery clamping. The contralateral kidney served as control. One hour after release of clamp, mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was reduced by 50 to 70 percent in the ischemic kidney. Bicarbonate reclamation (mEq/liter GFR) was comparable in both kidneys. However, ischemia resulted in impaired distal acidification as judged by three separate maneuvers: minimal urinary pH following sulphate infusion was higher in ischemic than in control kidney (6.61 +/- 0.39 vs. 5.39 +/- 0.26, P less than 0.01), mean urine to blood PCO2 difference (U-B PCO2) was significantly lower during phosphate infusion (ischemic: 13.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, control: 37.2 +/- 6.8 mm Hg, P less than 0.01) and was completely abolished during isotonic NaHCO3 infusion in the ischemic kidney (-1.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) compared to control (40.1 +/- 14.8 mm Hg, P less than 0.05). Urinary potassium excretion was intact following ischemia and was appropriately suppressed by amiloride. Administration of 0.7 M NaHCO3 solution at a rate sufficient to produce maximally alkaline urine resulted in a similar U-B PCO2/UHCO3 relationship in both kidneys in the face of impaired distal acidification in the ischemic kidney. This suggests either that the defect may be reversed by massive bicarbonate infusion or, alternatively, that U-B PCO2 difference may be related to other factors in addition to distal H+ secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical status of the nephropathy before conception was that 43 had only mild renal dysfunction, five had moderate renal insufficiency, serum creatinine (1.3 to 1.9 mg%), eight women had hypertension (150/100 mm Hg) and eight had nephrotic range proteinuria. Their clinical course was compared with a control group of 36 women with primary glomerular disease who did not become pregnant, and were matched for similar age, histological type, and status of nephropathy (renal function, blood pressure and proteinuria). After one year and at the end of the five year follow-up period, the incidence of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal failure was similar in the two groups. The fetal survival rate was 92%; 51 pregnancies ended in full-term delivery, with a mean birthweight of 3,242 +/- 320 g. There were seven pre-term deliveries (2,170 +/- 135 g), three small for gestational-age (2,340 +/- 135 g), two stillbirths and three spontaneous abortions.

Plasma water, whole plasma, and whole blood were the solvent systems used with variable drug concentrations and solvent flow rates. Our results indicate that the sieving coefficients for both drugs can be accurately defined as the concentration in the ultrafiltrate divided by the concentration in the artery. This correlates with a more rigorously derived expression by Colton and Henderson (r = 0.98, P less than 0.00001 for both drugs) and avoids the necessity of measuring venous concentrations. Drug sieving in the three solvents followed expectations from known protein-binding data and was independent of solvent flow rate. For both drugs, at higher drug concentrations sieving increased in plasma, consistent with the saturation of protein-binding sites. In whole blood, sieving fell for both drugs with increasing drug concentrations, consistent with drug compartmentalization into red blood cells. Although these sieving changes with increasing drug concentrations were statistically significant, their clinical significance is doubtful. Phenytoin sieving in plasma was increased by the addition of free fatty acids, consistent with a protein-drug displacement effect. There appears to be a real, but small, effect of protein concentration polarization, protein-membrane and drug-membrane interactions on drug sieving. Our observations are consistent with the expectation that the major determinant of drug sieving is the extent of drug-protein binding.\r"

The intravenous administration of deferoxamine, 40 mg/kg, led to a 730 +/- 139% increase in aluminum removal, compared to an increase of 641 +/- 178% after the drug was administered intraperitoneally. The mean dialysate: plasma concentration ratio for aluminum rose from 0.17 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.03 with intravenous deferoxamine administration, and from 0.19 +/- 0.05 to 0.38 +/- 0.07 with the intraperitoneal instillation of deferoxamine. In the seven patients with paired studies using both modalities of administration, there were no significant differences in the increments in plasma aluminum or in aluminum removal over a 24-hour period. In patients from whom effluent dialysate was collected for several days after the administration of deferoxamine, daily aluminum losses increased from 218 +/- 76 micrograms/24 hours before the administration of desferrioxamine to 1521 +/- 339, 1120 +/- 232, and 948 +/- 328 micrograms/24 hours over three successive days after deferoxamine. These data indicate that aluminum is effectively removed after the administration of either intravenous or intraperitoneal deferoxamine. The enhanced rate of removal of aluminum by peritoneal dialysis persists for several days after a single dose of deferoxamine. The efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with intraperitoneal deferoxamine requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "We report an H deficiency in two Algerian brothers who had early-onset glomerulonephritis. In addition, one suffered from serious lung infections. The H deficiency was defined by undetectable CH50 and AP50, and low levels of H, C3 and B (less than 10% of normal levels). I and classical pathway components, including C4-bp were normal. CR1 was present on both patients' erythrocytes. No nephritic factor or other circulating alternative pathway activator was detected. The parents, who are first cousins, and a healthy brother and sister had half-normal levels of H. These findings favor an autosomal recessive transmission of the H defect. Although by electron microscopy renal biopsies from both patients were typical for dense intramembranous deposit disease, immunofluorescence microscopy showed an atypical pattern with abundant granular C3 deposits within the mesangium and along the capillary walls. Alternative pathway activators, possibly related to dense deposits, may allow the formation of membrane-associated C3/C5 convertases, unusually stable in the absence of H, since C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 levels were decreased in both patients. This observation may represent an interesting clue to the relationship between nephritic factor, alternative pathway activation, and dense intramembranous deposit disease.\r"

While some differences were observed in early brainstem EP waves, the majority of differences occurred in the later waves associated with higher levels of cognitive processing. With tasks involving easy discriminations, CHD patients had longer latencies, indicative of less efficient cognitive processing, than CAPD patients who resembled controls. With difficult tasks, both CHD and CAPD groups showed abnormally-delayed later components. Similar results were obtained for the amplitude of the middle latency N1-P2 component, that is, reduced amplitudes for the CHD group with respect to both CAPD and control groups under low task demand, while both dialysis groups had reduced amplitudes under high task demand. These results suggest that CAPD patients are more similar to normals than CHD patients in ERP indices of attention and the efficiency of cognitive processing.\r"

Both female and male drinking drivers tend to drive in similar places and to be on the roads at similar times and days. They also carry similar numbers and types of passengers. The greater similarity of female drinking drivers to male drinking drivers than to nondrinking female drivers suggests caution in leaning too heavily on gender roles as explanations of female drinking-driving behavior.\r"

Analyses of data obtained in these interviews assessed the relative ability of eight variables to predict supervisor's actual identification and referral of female and male problem drinkers. In addition to numbers of employees supervised, the supervisors' judgment of the EAP's effectiveness was the best predictor of referral and identification, regardless of the sex of the referred subordinate. Knowledge and training in the EAP was a secondary contributor to referral of men, but played no role in female referrals. When controlling for all other variables, the extent to which supervisors held an egalitarian attitude toward women's rights and roles was found to be marginally positively related to identification of female drinkers. Similarly, a less stigmatized, stereotyped view of women's use and abuse of alcohol was marginally associated with a greater likelihood of referral of a female drinker to the EAP. Neither of these attitudinal variables was related to identification or referral of male problem drinkers.\r"

This study examines how adult children of alcoholics discuss their experiences in an Al-Anon group and describes their perceptions of change in self, personal problems, relationships, spirituality, childhood and the Al-Anon program. Twelve sessions of one Al-Anon chapter were observed, Al-Anon members were interviewed and a coding system to assess the content of the meetings was developed. Improvements constituted 25% of reports, of which improvement in problems constituted 20%. Members reported positive changes in self. Changes in relationships with alcoholics were few, as were changes in perceptions of the program (members felt positively about the program from the start). Although spirituality constituted less than 4% of the reports, many interviewees found spirituality the last and, ultimately, one of the most valued components of Al-Anon. A common experience of parental alcoholism, and cognitive, affective and behavioral antidotes to prior socialization in an alcoholic family contributed to the program's perceived helpfulness.\r"

Controlled drinkers had a goal of controlled drinking and were most likely to have had controlled drinking training during treatment. Relapsers were most likely to have been discharged from treatment prematurely, to receive further treatment and to use psychotropic medication. No controlled drinkers attended Alcoholics Anonymous or received residential care during follow-up in contrast to a small proportion of abstainers and relapsers who did. Some aspects of the drinking behavior of controlled drinkers and relapsers were also studied. Controlled drinkers were more likely to have a period of initial abstinence and for a longer period of time. Of the controlled drinkers, 66% drank at least once per week and 86% set themselves drinking limits; average consumption of alcohol was 48 and 32 g/day by men and women, respectively. The majority of controlled drinkers changed their preferred beverage and their social and physical drinking environment after treatment in accordance with therapeutic advice.\r"

  ".W": "The primary approach to eliminating drug abuse in America for most of the 20th century has been to prohibit the use and sale of certain drugs and to shut down drug supply lines. Yet drug abuse persists at high levels and the use of outlawed substances is a common feature of American life from high school on. The failure of drug policies has not discouraged, but seemingly fuels, renewed efforts of the same kind. Contrasting with this focus on the inherent dangers of the substance itself, the effort to control alcohol abuse has instead focused, since the end of Prohibition, on the characteristics of the individual alcoholic. In recent years, however, the public-health model of alcohol abuse and the psychophysiological formulation of alcohol dependence have emphasized that alcoholism is a consequence of the amount of alcohol available in the society and consumed by the individual drinker. In this way, alcohol and drug dependence (or addiction) formulations have coalesced: both assume that uncontrolled use results from regular or excessive consumption of these substances. This unified model of addiction based on exposure to a substance fails to account for substantial interindividual, intraindividual and cultural variability in patterns of use. The evidence is, moreover, that control-of-supply policies will never reduce substance abuse significantly and that such policies may backfire by propagating images of substances as being inherently overpowering.\r"

All mean latency values were found comparable for the two groups. For a number of waves in each ear, data for alcoholics were significantly more variable than that of controls. A significant number of alcoholics, however, had atypical waveforms (i.e., missing components) and some, unexpected I/V amplitude differences, with the amplitude of wave I larger than that of V in comparison to controls. The clinical interpretation of evoked potential findings for individual alcoholic patients is likely to be precarious due to the observed high variability of latency and amplitude values.\r"

  ".W": "Several investigators have indicated that changes in tumor size may not occur after hyperthermia therapy even with substantial tumor cell kill, because of early edema and subsequent fibrosis of background stroma, suggesting that \"tumor stabilization\" might be an important benefit of thermal therapy. Recently, 9 institutions completed a national cooperative study of localized hyperthermia for patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic solid cancer that evaluated the potential significance of this response variable in a standardized clinical trial. Of 960 evaluable patients who completed at least one course of hyperthermia, thermoradiotherapy, or thermochemotherapy, 85 (9%) had complete responses for 1-34 months, 173 (18%) had partial responses for 1-39 months, 95 (10%) had minimal responses for 1-15 months, and 313 (33%) had disease stabilization for 1-32 months. Of 313 patients who had no change (i.e., +/- 25%) in the size of their tumors after hyperthermia, the response lasted only 1-3 months in 170 (54%) patients, a finding of questionable clinical significance. However, disease stabilization was observed for more than 3 months in 143 (46%), for more than 6 months in 67 (21%), more than 9 months in 33 (10%), and more than 12 months in 16 (5%). Disease stabilization was also associated with improved activity for 1-22 months in 79 (25%) of these patients, and improved pain for 1-22 months in 100 (32%). Disease stabilization appeared to be independent of tumor histology, location, or depth within the body, size, or minimum treatment temperature, but was somewhat more frequent after hyperthermia combination therapy. There is sufficient accumulative data to suggest that tumor stabilization after hyperthermia should not be dismissed as a placebo effect. This response variable well may be a unique and potentially important criterion of response to localized hyperthermia therapy.\r"

Tamoxifen is an incomplete estrogen antagonist with partial estrogen agonist activity as well. Tamoxifen-induced exacerbation of breast cancer (\"tamoxifen flare\") is reported to occur in 4-20% or more of treated patients. Management of this condition has varied from stopping treatment to continued administration or reinstitution of tamoxifen after flare symptoms subside. Responses have occurred in some patients so treated, although the remissions do not appear durable. The seven patients with advanced breast cancer in this report experienced disease exacerbation with tamoxifen therapy. Endocrine ablation afforded all patients excellent pain relief and disease control with prolonged survival in six of the seven. There have been no studies directly examining the disease course in flare patients continuing on tamoxifen. Persistence in treating these patients with an incomplete antagonist-agonist may deprive them of full survival benefit possible through ablative procedures when used in sequential treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A rare case of salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma, in which the majority of cells were oncocytic, is reported. The patient, a 53-year-old man, presented with a parotid gland mass that was otherwise asymptomatic. Surgical treatment consisted of a superficial parotid lobectomy. The specimen was prepared in standard fashion and studied by light and electron microscopy. The microscopic features were characteristic of salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas, however, both epithelial and \"mesenchymal\" elements were oncocytic. Such changes may occur focally in pleomorphic adenomas, but we were unable to find documentation of a wholly oncocytic variant in a review of the medical literature. From our clinical data and previous reports of pleomorphic adenomas with focal oncocytosis, it is concluded that such changes likely do not alter prognosis in affected patients. The possible significance of this lesion in regard to the histogenesis of salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas is discussed.\r"

Five patients underwent lymph node dissection and in three of them regional metastases were found. Of the four patients with regional and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, three died within 6 to 60 months and the fourth is alive with metastatic spread. Of the two patients with melanoma confined to the nail bed, one is free of disease 50 months following diagnosis and the other suffered from a local recurrence and has been free of disease for 30 months following wide excision and limb perfusion.\r"

A right upper lobectomy was performed because of an abnormal shadow in the lung detected by an X-ray mass survey. A carcinoid tumor originated from the spur region of the right upper lobe bronchus. The tumor protruded into the bronchial lumen and also extensively expanded into the surrounding alveolar tissue. The tumor showed typical histological features of bronchial carcinoid with a mixed insular, trabecular, and glandular pattern. Multiple implanted foci of tumor cells were found in the periphery of the lobe. The implanted tumor cells replaced the alveolar epithelium without destruction of the alveolar structure, which suggests the possibility of aergenous spread of bronchial carcinoid. This is the first report on bronchial carcinoid with aerogenous spread.\r"

During cardiac ischemia we have compared myocardial surface cooling with topical cold saline (Group I, N = 9), crystalloid cardioplegia plus topical cold saline (Group II, N = 8) and cardioplegia with a specially designed cooling jacket (Group III, N = 8) in patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement, or both. Temperatures were assessed and recorded continuously in standardized locations for the right and left ventricular epicardium and endocardium. In Group I the rate of cooling was significantly slower than in the other two groups. Also, excessive gradients were developed across the left and right ventricular walls. In Group II the rate and depth of cooling were adequate and initial temperature gradients were eliminated. However, over the period of ischemia, significant rewarming occurred. In Group III temperatures were reduced rapidly and uniformly and maintained at or below 10 degrees C for the duration of the ischemic period. These differences are statistically significant (p less than 0.05). For optimal myocardial hypothermia, we recommend the following: separate cannulation of the superior and inferior venae cavae with caval snares; venting of the pulmonary artery (if inadequate, pulmonary vein occlusion or direct left atrial venting); induction of myocardial hypothermia with crystalloid or cold blood cardioplegia; and maintenance of hypothermia by the cooling jacket described herein. It is also desirable to continuously monitor temperatures of the right and left ventricular endocardial and epicardial surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of computed tomography and surgical mediastinal exploration in determining tumor resectability were retrospectively evaluated in 92 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Status of mediastinal nodes was ultimately determined by surgical mediastinal exploration or thoracotomy. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of chest roentgenography: Group I comprised 30 patients with peripheral T1 or T2 lesions with normal hilar and mediastinal shadows. Only one patient was found to have an involved node. Chest roentgenography had an accuracy rate of 96% and computed tomography, 93%. Thoracotomy is recommended without either computed tomography or surgical mediastinal exploration in this group. Group II comprised 47 patients with T1 or T2 lesions with an abnormal hilus, an abnormal mediastinal shadow, or either the hilus or mediastinum obscured by overlying parenchymal disease. Computed tomography revealed mediastinal nodes 1 cm or greater in size (abnormal node group) in 21 patients (45%) and smaller than 1 cm (normal node group) in 26 patients (55%). Surgical mediastinal exploration was performed in the abnormal node group and involved nodes were found in 17 of 21 patients (81%). In the normal node group, thoracotomy only was performed and no involved nodes were found. Computed tomography is recommended in all patients in Group II. Patients in the normal node group may be subjected to thoracotomy only and those in the abnormal node group should undergo surgical mediastinal exploration as the next diagnostic step before thoracotomy. Group III comprised 15 patients with grossly abnormal mediastinal shadows. Findings from computed tomography were abnormal in all 10 patients in whom it was done. Surgical mediastinal exploration was done in all 15 and yielded abnormal results in 14. It is recommended in this group that computed tomography is unnecessary and surgical mediastinal exploration should be the only diagnostic procedure. Thus, in potentially resectable non-small cell lung carcinoma, the use of computed tomography and surgical mediastinal exploration should be selective and should be determined by appropriate initial interpretation of the chest roentgenogram.\r"

Sixty-three patients underwent 64 sleeve resection procedures (47 with concomitant pulmonary resection and 17 without) at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1962 in 1986 with a 30 day mortality rate of 4.7%. Applicability of the technique for bronchial lesions which do not require concomitant pulmonary resection is emphasized. Types of disease included a heterogeneous collection of 31 benign tumors, neoplasms of low-grade malignant potential, and bronchostenosis and 33 bronchogenic carcinomas. Actuarial disease-free survival rate for the former group was 100% at 5 years. Quality of life was excellent for this group. Five-year survival rates for bronchogenic carcinoma (24 squamous cell, seven adenocarcinoma, two undifferentiated) were 58% +/- 25% (+/- standard error), 69 +/- 18%, and 38% +/- 13% in Stages I, II, and III, respectively. The 5 year survival rate of 31% +/- 16% in 14 patients selected because of decreased respiratory reserve compared with 60% +/- 14% in 19 patients for whom sleeve was the operation of choice on the sole basis of anatomic suitability. Sleeve resection is the ideal form of excisional therapy for benign endobronchial tumors, bronchostenosis, tumors of low-grade malignant potential, and for selected cases of carcinoma.\r"

Previous studies using roller pump percutaneous bypass were only partially successful because of the inability to effectively unload the left ventricle. In the present experiment we attempted to determine in a normal canine model whether use of synchronous pulsatile pumping for percutaneous bypass could overcome this problem. Fourteen dogs were placed on percutaneous bypass for 1 hour. A roller pump was used in seven and a synchronous pulsatile pump with an electrocardiogram triggering mechanism in the other seven. All animals were maintained on percutaneous bypass for 1 hour. In the pulsatile pump group there was a significantly greater percent decrease from baseline in tension-time index (-56.3% versus -19.1%, p less than 0.01) and in myocardial oxygen consumption (-45.8% versus +2.1%, p less than 0.05) and a significantly greater percent increase in the endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio (27.6% versus -6.5%, p less than 0.01) than in the roller pump group. These results show that superior unloading can be achieved by percutaneous pulsatile bypass compared with percutaneous roller pump bypass. The findings suggest that percutaneous total cardiopulmonary bypass with a synchronous pulsatile pump offers a relatively simple but effective method for providing appropriate patients with temporary hemodynamic stability before cardiac catheterization or medical or surgical revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "Complex left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after operation for subaortic stenosis or with hypoplastic aortic anulus remains a challenge for pediatric cardiac surgeons. We have recently applied a new technique of extended aortic root replacement using a cryopreserved aortic allograft to treat two patients who had previously been operated on for subaortic stenosis and a third who had aortic stenosis with a hypoplastic aortic anulus. This new procedure combines the concept of aortoventriculoplasty with aortic root replacement and coronary artery reimplantation. The valved aortic homograft is used in place of an aortic valve prosthesis and the attached anterior mitral leaflet augments the interventricular septum to relieve the subvalvular left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The coronary ostia are then reimplanted into the allograft and an anastomosis between the distal graft and the ascending aorta is completed. Allograft aortic tissue is then used to patch the right ventricular outflow tract. One patient had aortic stenosis with annular hypoplasia and did well after extended root replacement. Two patients had previous operations for subaortic stenosis before undergoing extended aortic root replacement. One required mediastinal exploration and drainage at 2 weeks for Serratia marcescens mediastinitis and bacteremia, but uncomplicated recovery followed. The other patient had complete heart block for 2 days, but normal sinus rhythm resumed and convalescence was benign. This modified technique with the aortic allograft was very helpful in treating these difficult problems, and the lack of mortality, limited morbidity, and good functional results are encouraging.\r"

  ".U": "87142953\r", 
  ".W": "Operative treatment of dissections of the ascending aorta differs from that for the descending aorta, not only because of the need for cardiopulmonary bypass, but also because of the frequent occurrence of aortic valve insufficiency. To determine the early and late results of operative repair, we have reviewed the case histories of 121 consecutive patients who underwent repair of ascending aortic dissections between 1962 and 1985. Ages ranged from 16 to 79 years (mean 56 +/- 14 years); 54 patients had operation within 2 weeks of onset of symptoms (acute), and the remainder had later repair (chronic). Seventy patients (58%) had clinical evidence of aortic insufficiency at the time of admission. During repair of acute dissection, 10 patients (19%) had aortic valve resuspension and 15 patients (28%) had aortic valve replacement. During repair of chronic dissection, eight patients (12%) had resuspension and 43 patients (64%) had replacement. Overall operative mortality was 22%, significantly higher for patients with acute than for those with chronic dissections (39% versus 9%, p less than 0.01). Operative risk was similar for patients who underwent repair of ascending aortic dissections without valve resuspension or replacement (31%) versus those who had repair with aortic valve resuspension (17%) or replacement (17%). During a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 208 months, aortic regurgitation developed in only two patients who did not have aortic insufficiency at the time of repair. Late aortic regurgitation necessitating reoperation developed in one of the 15 survivors who had aortic valve resuspension. Eight patients undergoing aortic valve replacement had complications of their prostheses, including one periprosthetic leak and four mechanical failures. We conclude that resuspension or replacement of the aortic valve does not increase the risk of repair of ascending aortic dissections. Selective management of aortic insufficiency (with valve repair whenever possible) yields satisfactory long-term results.\r"

  ".W": "Double-chambered right ventricle is an uncommon congenital anomaly consisting of obstruction of the trabecular zone of the ventricle by an elevated, hypertrophied moderator band, with or without additional muscle bundles(s). During an 18 month period (August 1984 to February 1986) 12 patients underwent repair of double-chambered right ventricle. Their ages ranged from 13 months to 12 years (mean 4.4 years). Associated lesions were ventricular septal defect in 11 patients (three closed spontaneously), atrial septal defect in two, left superior vena cava in three, aortic valve prolapse in one, and mild subaortic stenosis in two. Right ventricular outflow tract gradients were from 30 to 165 mm Hg (mean 77.2 +/- 37.3 mm Hg). The initial six patients (Group 1) were treated in the \"classical\" manner with a right ventriculotomy for muscle resection and ventricular septal defect closure (4/6). All patients survived. Five of the six required pharmacologic support for signs of mild to moderate right ventricular failure. The right ventricular outflow tract gradient postoperatively was 0 mm Hg in five patients and 25 mm Hg in one patient. Oxygen saturations were checked in the right atrium and pulmonary artery in all six patients, and one patient had a step-up of more than 10%. In the next six patients (Group 2) a previously unreported right atrial-pulmonary artery approach was used to avoid a ventriculotomy. The right ventricular outflow tract gradient was 0 mm Hg in five patients and 5 mm Hg in the sixth. A ventricular septal defect was closed in four of the six patients. There were no deaths, and no patient required inotropic support. Follow-up has been from 2 to 20 months. There have been no late deaths, and all patients are asymptomatic. One patient in Group 1 still has signs of a residual ventricular septal defect at 1 year. No patient has echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All patients have remained in sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. No patient has been recatheterized. Repair of double-chambered right ventricle is easily performed without a ventriculotomy. The atrial exposure of the ventricular septal defect is excellent. The muscle bundle(s) can be visualized easily through an initial transverse pulmonary arteriotomy with completion of resection through the tricuspid valve.\r"

All Bjork-Shiley patients and 57% of patients with a Carpentier-Edwards valve in the mitral position received long-term anticoagulation. Mean follow-up was 3.2 years (range 0 to 8.8) in the Bjork-Shiley patients and 3.5 years (range 0 to 8.2) in the Carpentier-Edwards group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in hospital mortality (Bjork-Shiley 7.6%; Carpentier-Edwards 6.0%), overall incidence of embolism (Bjork-Shiley 1.4 per 100 patient-years; Carpentier-Edwards 1.6% py), endocarditis (Bjork-Shiley 0.6% py; Carpentier-Edwards 0.8% py), periporsthetic leak (Bjork-Shiley 1.6% py; Carpentier-Edwards 1.4% py), anticoagulant-related complications (Bjork-Shiley 0.3% py; Carpentier-Edwards 0.1% py), valve failure (Bjork-Shiley 0.78% py; Carpentier-Edwards 0.68% py), reoperation for complication (Bjork-Shiley 1.68% py; Carpentier-Edwards 1.22% py), and late mortality (Bjork-Shiley 3.1% py; Carpentier-Edwards 3.0% py). Actuarial freedom from valve-related events was similar in the two groups. In the aortic position, freedom from embolism was significantly better in the Bjork-Shiley group than the Carpentier-Edwards group (Bjork-Shiley 99% at 3 and 5 years; Carpentier-Edwards 96% and 92% at 3 and 5 years; p = 0.023). In the mitral position, the overall incidence of reoperation was higher in the Bjork-Shiley group (1.78% py) than in the Carpentier-Edwards group (0.48% py) (p = 0.004). Actuarial analysis shows this difference to be confined to the first 6 years of follow-up. The commonest indication for reoperation was valve failure in both groups. However, when analysis is confined to this indication, the difference between the reoperation incidence in the mitral position becomes insignificant (Bjork-Shiley 0.85% py; Carpentier-Edwards 0.29% py; p = 0.085). This study confirms the satisfactory performance of both the Carpentier-Edwards and Bjork-Shiley valves in the short and middle term and indicates no clear-cut advantage for either prosthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The potential for improving myocardial protection with the high-energy phosphates adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate was evaluated by adding them to the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution in the isolated, working rat heart model of cardiopulmonary bypass and ischemic arrest. Dose-response studies with an adenosine triphosphate range of 0.05 to 10.0 mmol/L showed 0.1 mmol/L to be the optimal concentration for recovery of aortic flow and cardiac output after 40 minutes of normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemic arrest (from 24.1% +/- 4.4% and 35.9% +/- 4.1% in the unmodified cardioplegia group to 62.6% +/- 4.7% and 71.0% +/- 3.0%, respectively, p less than 0.001). Adenosine triphosphate at its optimal concentration (0.1 mmol/L) also reduced creatine kinase leakage by 39% (p less than 0.001). Postischemic arrhythmias were also significantly reduced, which obviated the need for electrical defibrillation and reduced the time to return of regular rhythm from 7.9 +/- 2.0 minutes in the control group to 3.5 +/- 0.4 minutes in the adenosine triphosphate group. Under more clinically relevant conditions of hypothermic ischemia (20 degrees C, 270 minutes) with multidose (every 30 minutes) cardioplegia, adenosine triphosphate addition improved postischemic recovery of aortic flow and cardiac output from control values of 26.8% +/- 8.4% and 35.4% +/- 6.3% to 58.0% +/- 4.7% and 64.4% +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.01), respectively, and creatine kinase leakage was significantly reduced. Parallel hypothermic ischemia studies (270 minutes, 20 degrees C) using the previously demonstrated optimal creatinine phosphate concentration (10.0 mmol/L) gave nearly identical improvements in recovery and enzyme leakage. The combination of the optimal concentrations of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate resulted in even greater myocardial protection; aortic flow and cardiac output improved from their control values of 26.8% +/- 8.4% and 35.4% +/- 6.3% to 79.7% +/- 1.1 and 80.7% +/- 1.0% (p less than 0.001), respectively. In conclusion, both extracellular adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate alone markedly improve the cardioprotective properties of the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution during prolonged hypothermic ischemic arrest, but together they act additively to provide even greater protection.\r"

Newborn hearts showed twofold and threefold elevations of calcium when exposed to 30 and 40 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion, respectively, whereas sodium increase was noted only in the 40 minute group. Conversely, adult hearts exhibited sodium elevation if exposed to ischemia for 30 minutes and calcium accumulation occurred only after 40 minutes of ischemia. There was no significant alteration in intracellular sodium and calcium levels after ischemic intervals of 30 and 40 minutes in the neonate. These studies demonstrate that the immature newborn heart is the most susceptible and the neonatal heart is the least susceptible to injury sustained by ischemia followed by reperfusion. These differences in susceptibility to ischemia may be due to age-dependent alterations of intramembrane ionic pumps and channels.\r"

  ".W": "Short-term survival of patients who require ventricular assist pumping for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock has been encouraging and has provided enough survivors to allow evaluation of long-term results. We observed nine survivors, 39 to 69 years of age (mean = 54.6) for 10 to 53 months (mean = 31) after their discharge from the hospital. In three patients, the angiographic ejection fraction was normal before the operation, whereas in six patients it was moderately to severely impaired. All nine patients were in New York Heart Association Functional Class IV before operation. After operation, eight of the nine patients were in Functional Class I or II. In the remaining patient, the ejection fraction fell markedly and the postoperative functional class remained unchanged. Two patients were employed full-time and one, part-time. Five patients were retired but active and had no cardiac disability, although two of the five did have residual partial noncardiac disability. The remaining patient, a housewife, continued to have compensated congestive heart failure but was relieved of angina. During the follow-up period, five of the nine patients died suddenly after 12, 18, 25, 30, and 38 months from causes that included pulmonary embolus and probable arrhythmias. Survivors who have had ventricular assist pumping for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock have a good chance of resuming active lives. The risk of being a \"cardiac cripple\" is small, as is the risk of significant noncardiac disability.\r"

  ".U": "87142961\r", 
  ".W": "Extraluminal heparin-bonded shunts have been recommended to support the distal circulation and decompress the proximal vascular bed during procedures that require interruption of flow through the thoracic aorta. Shunts that originate in either the left ventricle or the proximal aorta are generally viewed as hemodynamically similar, despite incomplete documentation of their flow characteristics. The present study was conducted to further define these hemodynamic properties. Identical extraluminal shunts were placed from the left ventricular apex and aortic arch to the distal thoracic aorta in mongrel dogs. Simultaneous pressure and Doppler flow velocities were recorded in the carotid and femoral arteries. Computer-enhanced composite waveforms were used to assist data analysis. When compared to ventricular cannulation, aortic cannulation provided improved proximal decompression and increased mean distal flow. In addition, significant diastolic flow reversal was recorded in the distal circulation when ventricular cannulation was employed. On the other hand, ventricular cannulation was associated with the preservation of pulsatile flow, whereas flow generated by aortic cannulation was linear. It is concluded that extraluminal shunts that originate in the left ventricle and the proximal aorta have distinct hemodynamic properties. These differences may be clinically important in specific situations.\r"

Tricuspid annular circumference was at least 70% of normal in seven patients and between 55% and 70% in three patients. Two patients died during hospitalization. The eight surviving patients were asymptomatic 3 to 145 months after operation. The modified Fontan operation was performed on 10 patients. None of these patients had a tricuspid annular circumference greater than 70% of normal; the circumference was less than 55% in nine patients and between 55% and 70% in one patient. One patient died during hospitalization and one died later. Follow-up 6 to 48 months after operation showed that six patients were in the New York Heart Association Class I and two were in Class II. After effective preliminary palliation of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, definitive operation can be done with an operative risk of 15% (three of 20 patients) and excellent late results. Right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction can be done as a complete repair for patients who have adequate tricuspid annular size. The modified Fontan operation is the only option for definitive repair when the tricuspid anulus is severely hypoplastic.\r"

A factorial design was used to study 68 healthy volunteers randomized to receive various doses of aspirin, ethanol, or a combination of both for either 1 or 3 days. Fecal hemoglobin concentrations were measured before and after drug ingestions. Moderate quantities of ethanol (300 ml of 5% or 30 ml of 50% three times nightly) did not cause significant fecal blood elevation unless aspirin was administered concomitantly (P = 0.05). High-dose aspirin alone, 975 mg three times daily, induced abnormal blood loss (P less than 0.01). The highest HemoQuant levels were usually noted after concomitant administration of aspirin and ethanol at maximal doses for 3 days (P less than 0.005), some HemoQuant levels approaching 5 times the normal value. We conclude that, in a short-term analysis, social consumption of ethanol is unlikely to interfere with fecal blood testing but therapeutic doses of aspirin will.\r"

  ".W": "Severe hypoxemia associated with chronic liver disease is an uncommon disorder most likely due to an intrapulmonary vascular abnormality that has characteristics of both ventilation-perfusion mismatching and diffusion limitation. Anatomically, the intrapulmonary vascular abnormalities can occasionally be detected by angiography. Physiologically, the gas exchange abnormalities can be substantiated by contrast-enhanced two-dimensional echocardiography. Although orthodeoxia and platypnea have frequently been found in these patients, echocardiographic data suggest that vascular abnormalities can exist in the absence of orthodeoxia. We describe 11 patients who had severe hypoxemia and chronic liver disease and review their pulmonary angiographic, contrast echocardiographic, and arterial blood gas findings. Among five of these patients who were given almitrine bismesylate, an experimental medication thought to alter ventilation-perfusion relationships in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, one had improved oxygenation. We recommend that patients with hypoxemia associated with chronic liver disease have detailed studies to rule out reversible forms of hypoxemia and that those with severe hypoxemia undergo testing to determine the existence of intrapulmonary vascular abnormalities, especially if liver transplantation is considered.\r"

Nine patients (17%) without clinical MS had similar findings. Of the 56 patients with MS, 35 underwent both computed tomography (CT) and MRI. In this group, 80% of MRI scans showed multiple demyelinating lesions compatible with MS, as compared with 29% of the CT scans. A CT scan was \"positive\" more often if obtained within 1 month after an attack of MS than later. In contrast, the sensitivity of MRI or the number of lesions detected by MRI did not increase in patients with recent exacerbations. MRI was \"positive\" in patients with clinical MS more often than was any single evoked response study. In statistical analyses, both the sensitivity of MRI and the number of lesions were associated with the duration of MS. A pattern of confluent periventricular signaling around the lateral ventricle was associated with greater duration of MS and patient disability.\r"

Moreover, 32% rated their cosmetic results as \"perfect.\" No deaths occurred in the immediate postoperative period, but 13 patients had major complications--most commonly, wound infection or displacement or partial extrusion of the implant. All infections, however, occurred early in the study, and with increasing experience and improved selection of patients, the associated morbidity decreased. For the entire group, the mean duration of hospitalization was 7.8 days, similar to that for patients who undergo mastectomy without reconstruction (7.5 days). The high patient acceptance and the overall good results in this preliminary study support the use of breast reconstruction immediately after mastectomy.\r"

The age-adjusted incidence rates of breast cancer, after exclusion of patients with carcinoma in situ, increased 14% between the periods 1965 to 1974 and 1975 to 1982 (from 87.2 to 99.5 per 100,000 person-years). Much of this increase was due to the greater number of patients with less advanced disease: the frequency of both regional lymph node involvement and distant metastatic disease at initial diagnosis decreased. In addition, the incidence of carcinoma in situ more than doubled between the periods 1935 to 1944 and 1975 to 1982. These increased proportions of less advanced disease coincide with increased public and physician awareness of the importance of early detection. No change was demonstrated in overall survival during the study period, perhaps because the follow-up for the final study period was shorter than that for the previous periods. When divided into subsets by staging characteristics, only patients with distant metastatic disease had statistically significant improvement in survival over time (P less than or equal to 0.01)--from a median survival of 21 months in the period 1955 to 1974 to 28 months in the period 1975 to 1982. This increased survival is probably related to advances in therapy (such as combination chemotherapy). In addition, earlier detection of distant metastatic disease in the later study periods might have produced the apparent improvement in survival in this subgroup.\r"

To our knowledge, however, renovascular hypertension due to renal arterial aneurysms has not previously been reported in patients with this disease. We describe a patient with type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome who had multiple systemic and bilateral renal arterial aneurysms and hypertension. The hypertension could have been related to compression of renal tissue or arteries (or both) by the large aneurysms, associated stenoses, or small peripheral renal infarctions. A review of all patients in whom the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had been diagnosed at our institution between 1967 and 1985 revealed that 4 of the 200 patients had hypertension. Three of these patients, and probably all four, had secondary causes of hypertension: Cushing's syndrome, renal insufficiency, or renovascular hypertension (in the present case). We conclude that hypertension is rare in patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and that, if present, it most likely is secondary hypertension. A thorough search for secondary causes of hypertension should be undertaken in these patients.\r"

Mycetomas, direct mucosal and soft tissue invasion by fungi, were not observed. Immunologic findings include an immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus in 60% of patients, total serum IgE elevation in 85%, and serum precipitins to Aspergillus in 85%. A new therapeutic protocol was devised based on the current treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Therapy includes wide local debridement, adequate sinus aeration, and the postoperative use of systemic steroids. Seven patients placed on systemic corticosteroids are asymptomatic for a mean of 14 months. Diagnosis of allergic Aspergillus sinusitis requires a high index of suspicion, a confirmatory diagnosis from the inspissated mucus, and an immunologic evaluation prior to the institution of corticosteroid therapy.\r"

However, one of the concerns with postoperative radiation treatment is the possibility of delay in beginning the treatment because of an unhealed surgical wound. A delay of more than 6 weeks is detrimental. In order to study the effect of radiation therapy on incompletely healed wounds, a retrospective chart review of such cases during the period 1977 to 1984 was undertaken. One hundred and eighty-five patients had planned postoperative radiation therapy, and 13 of these began radiation therapy with an unhealed wound or fistula. Six of 10 wounds closed spontaneously, 4 required surgical closure, and 3 failed to heal. Seven patients in this study died with cancer, 2 died of other causes, 3 are alive without disease, and 1 patient remains alive with disease. We conclude that giving radiation therapy to an open wound with appropriate precaution can be done without serious complications.\r"

One hundred seventeen patients with LeFort fractures were treated between 1978 and 1984. Of the 117 patients, 21 had a LeFort I fracture, 46 had a LeFort II fracture, 14 had a LeFort III fracture, and 36 had various combinations of the three types of LeFort fractures. Thirty-one patients (26.5%) presented with airway obstruction, decreased respiration, or both, requiring either tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation. Of the 31 patients undergoing emergent tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation, 26 (83.9%) had loss of consciousness relating to their injuries. Thirty-nine (33.3%) additional patients had an elective tracheotomy either at the time of surgical repair of their fractures or for prolonged endotracheal intubation. Age and sex of the patients played no role in the incidence of airway complications in patients with LeFort fractures. Patients with LeFort III fractures and those with associated injuries such as mandible fracture, laryngeal and pharyngeal injury, and chest or closed head injury are at greater risk for requiring emergent control of the airway.\r"

The Biopsy Nuclear Binding assay measures the amount of biologically active receptor that binds both steroid hormone and acceptor sites in the nucleus. This assay does not measure the entire receptor population, only those that are biologically active; therefore, it should more accurately predict the response to steroid-hormone therapy. We applied this assay effectively in breast and endometrial carcinoma. Preliminary studies have shown that 40% of patients with head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas have biologically active (nuclear bound) progesterone receptors. If nuclear binding predicts a remission with hormonal therapy, then the quality of life of appropriately selected patients could greatly improve.\r"

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a well-described heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies characterized by a natural history ranging from indolent to aggressive growth. Little has been written, however, concerning the specific features of this disease in the head and neck. Between 1974 and 1984, 287 patients were treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting in the head and neck. A multivariant analysis of these cases forms the basis of this report. All case material was reviewed and classified according to the working formulation of the National Cancer Institute and the Ann Arbor Classification System for lymphomas. Sites of initial presentation, methods of diagnosis, choice of therapy and subsequent response to treatment were related to the manifestations of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the head and neck. Of particular interest to the head and neck surgeon is the constellation of presenting signs and symptoms which point one to the possibility of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

For patients with tongue base and/or laryngeal obstruction, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP, ppp) will not alleviate the obstruction. Prior authors have proposed that the hyoid bone position as determined by cephalometric x-rays can predict which patients have obstruction at a lower site than the soft palate. In this study, patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were evaluated with polysomnographic testing, fiberoptic endoscopy, and cine-CT scans (Imatron Scanner with multiple level rapid sequence scans) in an attempt to determine precisely the site of airway obstruction. Measurements of airway size taken at the time of fiberoptic pharyngoscopy were compared with those determined by the cine-CT studies. Initial results revealed that fiberoptic pharyngoscopy in the sitting and supine positions was helpful in confirming pharyngeal airway sites with smaller diameters in awake patients. However, the cine-CT exam performed in both sleeping and awake states provided more direct data regarding the airway during sleep. We feel that with more clinical experience the cine-CT technique will prove to be the most helpful study for identification of the obstructive airway site in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\r"

Parallel series of otocyst/mesenchyme (O/M) and isolated periotic mesenchyme (M) explants provided morphological and biochemical data. The results indicate that epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions control development of both the otic capsule and the perilymphatic spaces. The otocyst induces cartilage differentiation in periotic mesenchyme between embryonic days 11 to 13 and organizes otic capsule morphology between embryonic days 13 to 14 in the mouse embryo. The otocyst exerts a localized repression of chondrogenesis in nearby mesenchyme during perilymphatic space formation on embryonic days 12 to 14.\r"

Low-power energy and intermittent short exposure accomplished photocoagulation with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. Follow-up study in these patients has ranged from 1 to 3 years with excellent results in 14 of 16 patients. Few complications and no major morbidity or mortality occurred. Photocoagulation of hemangiomas of the head and neck using the Nd-YAG laser appears to be an exciting new therapeutic option for this difficult problem. Further clinical study and follow-up appear to be warranted.\r"

Surgical procedures involving the airway have so far failed to provide a long-term solution to this problem. Because the sphincteric properties of the larynx could be used to help separate the air from the food passages on a dynamic basis, we present the concept of an artificial reflex are (ARA) in the canine. The afferent limb of this system consists in a cervical cutaneous sensory surface containing the specific biologic sensors for pressure and stretch, subtended by a corresponding sensory nerve, destined to be eventually implanted into the pharynx. The efferent limb picks up the information resulting from the sensor's distention via a frequency modulator and an amplifier, prior to transmitting it to the recurrent laryngeal nerves through monopolar electrodes, resulting in synchronous glottic closure. In order to test this new concept as a pilot study, this principle was applied in three dogs by using an island of cervical skin tubed on itself and the contralateral strap muscles as effector. Inflation of a Foley catheter introduced into the lumen of this tube resulted in synchronous strap muscle contraction, following corresponding increase in the firing frequency in the subtended sensory nerve. The data obtained in this series of experiments should permit further application at the laryngeal level.\r"

Quick-freeze, deep-etch electron microscopy of the guinea pig TM demonstrated a dense meshwork of fibers embedded in a complex microfibrillar matrix which may consist of proteoglycans; the larger fibers were similar in size and appearance to type II collagen fibers of elastic cartilage. Finally, the comparative free amino acid profiles of TM strongly suggest that the TM is chemically transparent with respect to endolymph. Thus, the TM appears to consist of a highly hydrated matrix mechanically stabilized by type II collagen fibers.\r"

Of the five ears, there were two common cavity deformities, two cochlear hypoplasias, and one incomplete partition. Four of the five ears had an auditory response to stimulation by the implant at the same level as ears deafened by other disorders. One ear that had an auditory response to stimulation also produced facial stimulation that precluded use of the implant. The one ear that did not stimulate was the incomplete partition. This ear had a very narrow internal auditory canal. Three patients are now using the implant in three ears to detect sound. Results show that a cochlear implant may enable sound detection in a patient with a malformed cochlea but that a very narrow internal auditory canal (less than 1.5 mm) detected preoperatively on radiographs may contraindicate an implant. Such anatomy suggests only a rudimentary audiovestibular nerve or no such nerve and only a facial nerve.\r"

Based on a review of 63 patients with 98 congenitally malformed ears, we have been able to recognize a number of distinct anatomic patterns from their radiographic appearance. A remarkable similarity between these morphologies and the appearance of the inner ear at various stages of embryogenesis was found. This led us to propose a classification system based upon the theory that these deformities result from an arrest of development during varying stages of inner ear organogenesis.\r"
