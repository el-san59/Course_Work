The levels of intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and of the free alpha and beta subunits, were measured by specific immunoassays. There was a close association between blood and urine levels of intact hCG and of the alpha subunit of hCG, but no relation between the levels of beta subunit in these sites. These findings suggest that the use of \"beta subunit\" assays may give discrepant results according to the fluid examined. By contrast, measurement of intact hCG appears to give similar results in blood and urine.\r"

  ".W": "Serum samples were collected from 915 nonhospitalized Roman Catholic nuns with a median age of 55 years (range 19-94 years). Using an immunoradiometric assay, serum CA 125 levels ranged from 0-574 U/mL with a median of 10.5 and mean of 14.3 U/mL. Thirty-six women (3.9%) had serum levels greater than 35 U/mL, and only seven (0.76%) had serum CA 125 levels above 65 U/mL. In only 14 (2.4%) of 586 women aged 50 or older were CA 125 levels above 35 U/mL, and in only three (0.51%) of this group did levels exceed 65 U/mL. Among the seven women with levels above 65 U/ML, five were found to have benign or malignant neoplasms or other masses at the time of entry into the study or during the follow-up interval (mean 311 +/- 103 days). Moreover, in six of seven members of this \"false positive\" group, some disorder was diagnosed during the study period that might have elevated the CA 125 level. No correlation was found between serum CA 125 levels and a variety of nonmalignant disorders or a variety of concurrent medications. The apparent specificity of the CA 125 assay in this study population suggests that, if used in conjunction with other tests to discriminate ovarian carcinoma from disorders that could elevate serum CA 125 levels, this assay might be a potential component of a strategy aimed at the early detection of ovarian cancer.\r"

The most serious component of the disorder is cardiac myxoma, which has caused the death of one fourth of the affected patients and serious disability in an equal number. It is, therefore, important to recognize patients at risk from the syndrome and, in particular, to test them for cardiac myxoma. Fortunately, in many patients the myxoma complex has a clearly visible marker: mucocutaneous pigmentation. Among 58 patients with the syndrome, spotty facial pigmentation was present in 36 (62%), and 29 (50%) of these also had pigmented spots on their lips. This type and distribution of pigmentation should be a clue to the possible presence of the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity, and patients thus affected should be referred for further investigation. Oral cavity myxoma(s) occurred in four patients with the syndrome.\r"

Patients 20 years of age and younger had significantly lower mean maximum caries penetration scores before restorative treatment when compared to older patients. For all age groups, the mean maximum caries penetration scores indicated that, on the average, restorative treatment was initiated before there were radiographic changes in dentin. There were no differences among the dentists in the study regarding the mean elapsed time between radiographic caries diagnosis and restorative treatment. The random distribution and low number of apparent caries reversals, and the subsequent restoration of 25% of these teeth, suggested that the dentists in this study did not employ systematic remineralization strategies for their patients.\r"

Three of the infants had presented with congestive cardiomyopathy and two with dynamic muscular subaortic stenosis. No heart murmurs were audible in any of the parents of the five infants. The parents of the three infants without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction had normal echocardiographic results, whereas one parent of each of the infants with left ventricular outflow obstruction had asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The association between left ventricular outflow obstruction and parental asymmetric septal hypertrophy suggests that both septal hypertrophy and glycogen storage disease were inherited by these two infants.\r"

Microbial causes can include a variety of bacteria and fungi, the most common being Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gangrene from occlusive causes is not uncommon among cancer patients with coexisting atheromatous, thromboembolic, or obliterative vascular disease. Toxic gangrene is most commonly caused by extravasation of intravenously administered cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs but has also been associated with the use of coumarin congeners and the bite of the brown recluse spider. Pyoderma gangrenosum is an idiopathic condition that has been reported in association with myeloproliferative disorders. Finally, necrosis can be caused by the neoplasm itself, when its growth is so great that blood vessels are compressed and ischemia of the surrounding tissue results.\r"

To explore the immunological relationship between noncentrosomal and centrosomal antigens, immunoglobulins were affinity purified using the individual noncentrosomal antigens (from lymphoblastoma KE37 cells) and were tested for their capacity to bind to human centrosomes in situ and to proteins from isolated centrosomes. In this way, the 36-kDa antigen, an abundant cytosolic protein, was shown to share at least one antigenic determinant with high molecular weight centrosomal proteins. This antigen was further identified by mild proteolysis as the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. In all the analyzed human cell lines, the centrosomal staining in situ was correlated with a strong labeling of purified lactate dehydrogenase in immunoblots. Conversely, the absence of centrosomal staining in rodent cells was always correlated with the absence of lactate dehydrogenase labeling. These data suggest an evolutionary relationship between centrosomal proteins and this \"housekeeping\" enzyme.\r"

We report findings that suggest that surfactant inhibits secretion of 3H-labeled phosphatidylcholine by cultured rat type II cells. The lipid components and the surfactant protein group of Mr 26,000-36,000 (SP 26-36) inhibit secretion to different extents. Surfactant lipids do not completely inhibit release; in concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml, lipids inhibit stimulated secretion by 40%. SP 26-36 inhibits release with an EC50 of 0.1 microgram/ml. At concentrations of 1.0 microgram/ml, SP 26-36 inhibits basal secretion and reduces to basal levels secretion stimulated by terbutaline, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the ionophore A23187. The inhibitory effect of SP 26-36 can be blocked by washing type II cells after adding SP 26-36, by heating the proteins to 100 degrees C for 10 min, by adding antiserum specific to SP 26-36, or by incubating cells in the presence of 0.2 mM EGTA. SP 26-36 isolated from canine and human sources also inhibits phosphatidylcholine release from rat type II cells. Neither type I collagen nor serum apolipoprotein A-1 inhibits secretion. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that surfactant secretion is under feedback regulatory control.\r"

During intracellular transport and maturation, F0 undergoes a conformational change resulting from the loss of intramolecular disulfide bonds. F0 is also cleaved to yield F1, F2, the active, membrane-fusing form of the protein. Two monoclonal antibodies were used to explore this conformational change and its relationship to cleavage. These antibodies failed to precipitate the pulse-labeled fusion protein but did precipitate the F0 and the F1, F2 forms of the \"chase\" fusion protein. Use of the inhibitors carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and monensin showed that the fusion protein acquired the ability to react with the monoclonal antibodies after it left the rough endoplasmic reticulum but before it left the medial Golgi membranes and before it was cleaved. The acquisition of antigenicity correlates with the disruption of intramolecular disulfide bonds during transit through the cell. This correlation was directly confirmed. The pulse-labeled fusion protein could be recognized by both monoclonal antibodies if the protein was first reduced. The formation and disruption of intramolecular disulfide bonds as a posttranslational modification of glycoproteins is discussed.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis of one of the protein kinase C clones, RP41, identifies a 224-amino-acid carboxyl-terminal region with approximately equal to 40% homology to the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains of both the cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The levels of mRNA homologous to RP41 are very high in brain, whereas much lower levels are present in heart and liver. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a second cDNA clone, RP16, identifies a deduced amino acid sequence that shares 65% homology with the corresponding region of the protein kinase C clone RP41. The levels of mRNA corresponding to RP16 are also high in rat brain, but the transcript sizes and tissue-specific expression patterns differ from those of RP41. These and additional results provide evidence that the gene encoding protein kinase C is a member of a novel serine/threonine protein kinase multigene family.\r"

The two human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 flanking sequences derived from the tumor were localized to chromosome regions 20pter----20q13 and 3p25----3qter, regions that also contain the protooncogenes c-src-1 and c-raf-1, respectively. The HPV 16 integration site in the SiHa cervical carcinoma-derived cell line is in chromosome region 13q14----13q32. The HPV 18 integration site in SW756 cervical carcinoma cells is in chromosome 12 but is not closely linked to the Ki-ras2 gene. Finally, in two cervical carcinoma cell lines, HeLa and C4-I, HPV 18 DNA is integrated in chromosome 8, 5' of the c-myc gene. The HeLa HPV 18 integration site is within 40 kilobases 5' of the c-myc gene, inside the HL60 amplification unit surrounding and including the c-myc gene. Additionally, steady-state levels of c-myc mRNA are elevated in HeLa and C4-I cells relative to other cervical carcinoma cell lines. Thus, in at least some genital tumors, cis-activation of cellular oncogenes by HPV may be involved in malignant transformation of cervical cells.\r"

The sequences of cloned 680-base-pair EcoRI fragments of the alphoid DNA from chromosomes 13 and 21 show that the basic unit of this subfamily is indistinguishable on each chromosome. The sequence of cloned 1020-base-pair Xba I fragments from chromosome 22 is related to, but distinguishable from, that of the 680-base-pair EcoRI alphoid subfamily of chromosomes 13 and 21. These results suggest that, at some point after they originated and were homogenized, different subfamilies of alphoid sequences must have exchanged between chromosomes 13 and 21 and separately between chromosomes 13 and 22.\r"

In this study we posed the question, could a growth factor gene be transcriptionally active in atherosclerotic tissue? We found that transcripts from the sis gene, which encodes one of the two chains of platelet-derived growth factor, were present in surgically removed human carotid artery lesions at levels 5-fold greater than the low level of constitutive expression detected in normal artery. This demonstrates that a growth factor could be synthesized endogenously within human atherosclerotic lesions. Although atherosclerotic lesions are composed predominantly of SMC, large numbers of infiltrating macrophages, T cells, and endothelial cells can also be present, raising the possibility that one of these secondary cell types, rather than SMC, could be responsible for the sis transcripts. Human macrophages activated in culture contained 2- to 4-fold more sis RNA, per micrograms of total cellular RNA, than lesions, whereas T cells activated in culture did not contain significant levels. Cultured human endothelial cells expressed sis transcripts at higher levels than macrophages. Since human arterial SMC in culture express receptors for and are mitogenically responsive to platelet-derived growth factor, transcription of the sis gene by cells within lesions, whether these cells are SMC themselves, macrophages, endothelial cells, or another cell type, suggests that an autocrine and/or paracrine proliferative mechanism is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\r"

Rabbit anti-phosphodiesterase antibody did not react with other phosphodiesterases or with the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Affinity-purified goat anti-calcineurin antibody recognized both the 61-kDa catalytic subunit and the 18-kDa Ca2+-binding subunit of the phosphatase. Neither antibody reacted with CaM, several CaM-binding proteins (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase, fodrin), or other cytosolic proteins from brain. The antibodies were used to compare the cellular localization of these two CaM-dependent enzymes in rat brain. Both calcineurin and phosphodiesterase were found predominantly in nerve cells; however, phosphodiesterase was restricted to very specific neuronal populations. Phosphodiesterase was prominent in the somatic cytoplasm and dendrites of regional output neurons--e.g., cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal and cortical pyramidal cells. The extensive and uniform staining in the dendrites was consistent with postsynaptic localization and suggested an important function for this enzyme in neurons that integrate multiple convergent inputs. Calcineurin was present in virtually all classes of neurons, with immunoreactivity confined primarily to cell bodies. Both diffuse cytoplasmic staining and characteristic punctate staining of cell bodies were observed; the latter suggested compartmentalization of calcineurin at or near the plasma membrane. The results of this study demonstrate that calcineurin and phosphodiesterase are differentially localized in the central nervous system. Thus, the expression and compartmentalization of CaM-binding proteins may be highly regulated and specific for particular differentiated nerve cell types.\r"

  ".W": "The specificity and efficiency of base-mispair editing by the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of phage T4 DNA polymerase has been measured using a sensitive infectivity assay. A series of oligodeoxynucleotide primer chains was synthesized chemically. These primers, when hybridized to phi X174 single-stranded DNAs containing an amber codon, result in a mispaired nucleotide at the 3'-hydroxyl end of the primer chain within the amber codon. DNA synthesis on these primer X templates without the removal of the mispaired terminal nucleotide results in the formation of heteroduplex molecules that yield viable revertants upon transfection into an amber nonsuppressor host. This method permits determination of the efficiency of editing of a mismatch to 1 in 10(6) mismatches that escape editing and allows all eight mispairs that can yield viable revertants at an amber codon to be studied. The results of experiments with primers hybridizing to phi X174 am16 and am3 codons show that the order of mispair editing by T4 DNA polymerase is Ttemplate X Gprimer less than (A X G, T X C) less than (T X T, G X A, G X G, A X C) less than A X A. The efficiency of editing depends upon the mispair, as well as the neighboring DNA sequence. Under these conditions of synthesis, the 3'----5' exonuclease activity, depending upon the mispair and DNA sequences beyond the nearest neighbors, is estimated to contribute a factor of from 2.3 X 10(3)- to greater than 10(6)-fold to the accuracy of T4 DNA polymerase.\r"

The peptides were sequenced on a gas-phase microsequencer, and glycosylation sites were identified as the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of N-acetylglucosaminylasparagine. The sequences were confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Highly homologous, extended amino-terminal sequences were determined for CEA and two NCAs, NCA-95 and NCA-55. Cysteine-containing sequences for CEA and NCA-95 show up to 95% sequence homology, and the CEA sequences also show internal sequence homologies.

The 1900-base-pair cDNA sequence compiled from all phage inserts appeared to represent the entire primary sequence of CBP (Mr 25,117). Blot analysis of human placental and HeLa mRNA revealed multiple CBP mRNA species ranging from 1925 to 2250 bases. The amino acid sequence of CBP showed homology to the cap-binding PB2 protein of influenza virus.\r"

When the activities of both topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2) and topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) in the extract were blocked with specific inhibitors or antibodies, DNA synthesis was decreased by a factor of 15-20. Addition of purified HeLa DNA topoisomerase II to extracts immunologically depleted of both topoisomerases completely restored replication, and the replication products consisted largely of monomeric daughter molecules. Addition of purified HeLa DNA topoisomerase I to depleted extracts restored DNA synthesis, but the primary products were multiply intertwined, catenated daughter molecules. We conclude that DNA topoisomerases have at least two roles in the replication of SV40 DNA. Either topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II is sufficient to provide the unlinking activity necessary for fork propagation during SV40 DNA replication. However, topoisomerase II is uniquely required for the segregation of newly synthesized daughter molecules.\r"

The molecular mass of this protein corresponds to the 28 kDa predicted for the product of gene 15 from its nucleotide sequence. The overproduced protein has been purified to near homogeneity and confirmed to be the product of gene 15 by amino acid sequence analysis of its N terminus. The purified product of gene 15 has a lysozyme activity similar to other phage-type lysozymes: products of phage T4 gene e and of phage P22 gene 19.

  ".W": "Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.\r"

  ".W": "A clear prediction of the helix-coil model for force generation in muscle is that force should be produced when the equilibrium (helix-coil) of a rigor (or activated) fiber is perturbed by a temperature jump near the melting temperature of the light meromyosin/heavy meromyosin hinge. An infrared, iodine-photodissociation laser was used to heat the fibers by approximately equal to 5 degrees C in under 1 mus. Under ionic conditions where rigor bridges are predominantly associated with the thick filament backbone, an abrupt drop in tension typical of normal thermoelastic expansion was seen. A similar response was observed below 41 degrees C for thick filament-released rigor bridges. Above this temperature, a rubber-like thermoelastic response was obtained typical of a helix-coil transition. At temperatures near 50 degrees C, the amount of force generated by a rigor fiber was large and comparable to that seen for an activated fiber at 5 degrees C. The relaxation spectra of force generation obtained for both systems (rigor and activated) show a step change followed by a biexponential kinetic process. The reciprocal relaxation times and amplitudes for these individual processes in activated and rigor fibers differ only by factors of 2-4. Force generation in the rigor muscle appears to arise from melting in the subfragment 2 hinge region of the myosin molecule since binding of subfragment 2 to the thick filament backbone inhibits force production. No significant force generation was observed following temperature jumps of relaxed fibers.\r"

The enantiomeric isomers A and B are active, although they are required at concentrations up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than zeatin riboside to promote comparable growth. We estimate that the active dehydrodiconiferyl glucosides are present in rapidly growing tissues (tumor tissue, habituated tissue, cultured nontransformed tissue) in micromolar concentrations. In quiescent tobacco pith tissue, the levels of these compounds are reduced by a factor of 100. These results suggest that cytokinin may exert control of cell division through the accumulation of molecules (the dehydrodiconiferyl glucosides) that are apparent cell wall components.\r"

Hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-icosatetraenoic acids represent major components of clastogenic factor. We report that several isomeric hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-icosatetraenoic acids efficiently induce DNA strand breakage and/or alkali-labile sites in the mouse embryo fibroblasts C3H/10T1/2. Fe chelation by desferrioxamine suppresses breakage by approximately equal to 42% indicating the participation of Fe-catalyzed radical reactions. An additional 37% inhibition is observed upon addition of the Ca2+ chelators EGTA and quin-2. This result suggests that hydroxyperoxy-5,8,11,13-icosatetraenoic acid may activate a Ca2+-dependent nuclease. The addition of the antioxidant enzymes CuZn-superoxide dismutase and catalase had no effect, while glutathione peroxidase suppressed strand breakage by 90%.

This gene is resistant to DNase I digestion in nuclei isolated from livers of 19-day rat fetuses. Gradual acquisition of sensitivity of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, which starts later than the 19th day of gestation and is completed by the 21st day, occurs before initiation of gene expression. As transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene is not detected until birth, the events observed may represent a shift from a dormant to an active gene. Injection of N6,O2-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate into fetuses on the 19th day of gestation induces gene expression and sensitivity to DNase I digestion within 3 hr of treatment. While this short treatment does not affect the methylation pattern of the gene, longer treatment of fetuses (2 days) with dibutyryl-cAMP results in premature hypomethylation of the gene. A hierarchy of modifications of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene during development is discussed.\r"

Chinese hamster ovary cells are allowed to endocytose either avidin-linked beta-galactosidase or biotinylated IgG. Postnuclear supernatant extracts prepared from these cells are incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. Fusion between vesicles from the two extracts permits the avidin-biotin association to occur, so that the amount of avidin-enzyme-biotinylated IgG complex produced is proportional to the amount of fusion between vesicles. The amount of complex formed is measured, after detergent lysis of the vesicles, by an ELISA technique, using a fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase. The fusion process requires ATP hydrolysis and specific cytosolic proteins. The vesicles that fuse appear to be endocytic vesicles populated by the endocytosed proteins within 5 min of their internalization at 37 degrees C. Ionophores and weak bases do not inhibit fusion, suggesting that a pH gradient across the vesicle membrane is not crucial for the fusion process.\r"

  ".W": "Caulobacter crescentus contains a 25- and a 27-kDa flagellin, which are assembled into the flagellar filament, and a 29-kDa flagellin, which is related in sequence but is of unknown function. We have used DNA sequence analysis and nuclease S1 assays to map the in vivo transcription start sites of the three flagellin genes and to study their regulation. These experiments lead to several conclusions. First, copies of the 29-, 25-, and 27-kDa flagellin genes are organized in a tandem array in the flaEY gene cluster of C. crescentus. Second, flagellin genes are under transcriptional control and each gene is expressed with a characteristic periodicity in the cell cycle. Third, flagellin gene promoters contain conserved nucleotide sequence elements at -13, -24, and -100 that are homologous to the fla genes in the hook gene cluster. The -13 and -24 sequences conform to a fla gene promoter consensus sequence (C/TTGGCC/GC-N5-TTGC) that is similar in sequence to the -12, -24 consensus sequence of the Klebsiella pneumonia nif gene promoters. Fourth, the sequence element at approximately -100 in the 25- and the 27-kDa flagellin genes is homologous to a 19-base-pair sequence [designated previously as II-1; see Chen, L.-S., Mullin, D. M. & Newton, A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 2860-2864]at -101 in the promoter of transcription unit II of the hook gene cluster; the two flagellin genes, like the fla genes examined in the hook gene cluster that contain the -100 element, are under positive control by transcription unit III of the hook gene cluster. This result supports a model in which the timing of fla gene transcription in the C. crescentus cell cycle is determined in part by a cascade of trans-acting regulatory gene products.\r"

The cDNA sequence encodes a processed protein of 367 residues with a Mr of 42,435 and a 28-residue amino-terminal signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence agreed closely with the portions of the mature protein that were sequenced using standard protein sequencing. The neonatal protein, however, contains an acidic carboxyl-terminal extension not present in the adult protein, suggesting that the cDNA sequence may have arisen from an alternatively spliced neonatal transcript. A single transcript of 1.9-2.0 kilobases was seen in neonatal skeletal muscle mRNA. A glycosylation site and two potential phosphorylation sites were detected. Although the protein contains about two acidic residues for each Ca2+ bound, there is no repeating distribution of acidic residues and no evidence of EF hand structures. Hydropathy plots show no transmembrane sequences, and structural analyses suggest that less than half of the protein is likely to be highly structured. This sequence defines the characteristics of a class of high-capacity, moderate-affinity, Ca2+ binding proteins.\r"

All 10 RNAs were superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that the increase in the mRNAs is the result of rapid transcriptional activation of their genes on stimulation by serum or platelet-derived growth factor. Superinducibility by cycloheximide is due to two effects: prolonged transcription and stabilization of mRNAs. This overall pattern of regulation is similar to that of the c-fos or c-myc protooncogenes reported previously. We hypothesize that these newly identified \"immediate early\" genes play a role in the proliferative response induced by growth factors.\r"

Transcription of the HBsAg gene starts at day 15 of development, together with that of the albumin gene, and reaches a comparable level at birth. HBsAg mRNA level and HBsAg production are parallel in males and females during prenatal development and until the first month of life, but HBsAg gene expression increases 5-10 times in males at puberty. After castration, the level of expression decreases dramatically in both males and females and is subsequently increased by injection of testosterone or estradiol. Glucocorticoids also regulated positively expression of the HBsAg gene. Our results suggest that sex hormones play a role in hepatitis B virus gene expression during natural infection and could explain the difference in incidence of chronic carriers between men and women.\r"

Maximal levels of c-myc and c-fos mRNAs were seen within 1 hr and were nearly undetectable at 6 hr after infection. At 12 hr after infection mRNA levels were again maximal and remained elevated thereafter. Empty virions (capsids) and recombinant VP1 protein, purified from Escherichia coli, induced the early but not the late phase of mRNA accumulation. Virions, capsids, and recombinant VP1 protein stimulated [3H]thymidine nuclear labeling and c-myc mRNA accumulation in a dose-responsive manner paralleling their affinity for the cell receptor for polyoma. The second phase of mRNA accumulation is regulated by the viral early gene products, as shown by polyomavirus early gene mutants and by a transfected cell line (336a) expressing middle tumor antigen upon glucocorticoid addition. These results suggest that polyomavirus interacts with the cell membrane at the onset of infection to increase the levels of mRNA for cellular genes associated with cell competence for DNA replication, and subsequently these levels are maintained by the action of the early viral proteins.\r"

We present evidence that the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate can cause a marked stimulation of phosphorylation of specific proteins in mammalian tissues. In the brain, there are at least two types of 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent protein phosphorylation systems, which differ in activator specificity, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to the activator. Both of these phosphorylation systems are, however, insensitive to cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+, calmodulin, and protein kinase C activators and have characteristics different from those of casein kinase II-catalyzed protein phosphorylation. The most prominent endogenous substrates in the bovine brain are rather minor proteins with minimal molecular masses of 72 and 155 kDa, which were not detected in \"nonnervous\" tissues such as heart, liver, lung, and kidney. In nonnervous tissues, 3-phosphoglycerate affected the state of phosphorylation of other proteins. Evidence provided suggests the occurrence of an as yet undescribed type of protein kinase, which may be designated 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent protein kinase, in mammalian tissues.\r"

One phase transition occurs when behavior of the free energy of the longest helical region abruptly changes from proportional to sequence length. The annealing of two single-stranded molecules and the melting of a double helix are both considered. These results, initially suggested by studies of optimal matching of random DNA sequences [Smith, T. F., Waterman, M. S. & Burks, C.

  ".W": "Tunicamycin at 10 micrograms/ml inhibits the growth and infectivity of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania mexicana amazonensis. Tunicamycin-resistant variants of this parasite were produced by gradual acclimatization of cells to increasing concentrations of the drug up to 80 micrograms/ml and a single-step selection of ethyl methanesulfonate-pretreated or differentiating leishmanias with the drug at 10 micrograms/ml. Prolonged exposure to the drug increases stability of drug resistance of those resistant to 10 micrograms/ml. Tunicamycin-resistant cells contain amplified DNA, which hybridizes in proportion to the cells' degree of drug resistance with Alg 7, a cloned DNA probe apparently encoding yeast N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. This enzyme from all variants remained sensitive to inhibition by tunicamycin, but its specific activity was up to 15-fold higher than that of the wild type. Thus, amplification of the gene encoding this enzyme appears to result in its overproduction in the variants, accounting for their resistance to tunicamycin. The tunicamycin-resistant cells are more virulent to mice than their parental wild type. Thus, leishmanial virulence may be related to amplification or expression of gene(s) encoding enzymes involved in the regulation of N-glycosylation of parasite proteins.\r"

This recombinant virus can infect normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and allow these cells to grow in soft agar in the presence of TGF-beta. Transformed cells isolated from colonies grown in soft agar contain an integrated form of the recombinant virus and secrete biologically active TGF-alpha into their medium. These results show that a biologically active TGF-alpha can be produced by a gene synthesized from only part of the coding region and that the infectious retrovirus carrying the TGF-alpha gene (SW355) can function as a transforming agent in NRK cells in the presence of TGF-beta.\r"

  ".W": "During the course of studies designed to assess the effect of human Ha-ras gene expression on the malignant behavior of transfected mouse tumor cells we noted that the process of Ca3(PO4)2-mediated DNA transfection was itself associated with profound alterations in tumorigenic or metastatic behavior. The cell line used as a recipient for these studies was a tumorigenic nonmetastatic CBA/J mouse mammary adenocarcinoma line called SP1. When cotransfected with plasmids containing the neo gene (pSV2neo) and the activated Ha-ras gene (pT24-c3), cells from the pooled (5-10 colonies) G418-resistant colonies gave rise to spontaneous lung metastases in 85% of mice after subcutaneous inoculation. However, we noted that 17% of control mice inoculated with G418-resistant pSV2neo-transfected SP1 cells also had lung metastases and that this number approached 100% as the inoculum comprised a greater pool size (50-100 colonies). When cell lines established from isolated pSV2neo-transfected colonies were examined, 3/16 were found to be metastatic. We also found that 3/16 clones grew slowly, or not at all, in CBA/J mice, whereas they grew readily in athymic (nude) mice. The increase in immunogenicity of two out of three of these latter clones was accompanied by expression of the class I H-2Dk major histocompatibility complex antigen that was not detectable in the parental SP1 cells. At least some of these results would appear to be due to exposure to Ca3(PO4)2 alone, as we found that it resulted in 5/20 (25%) clones manifesting metastatic properties. Our results suggest that heritable changes in malignant behavior of transfected tumor cells can be observed at high frequency subsequent to the process of Ca3(PO4)2-mediated DNA transfection, and these changes may be brought about in part by inherited disturbances in expression of recipient cell genes.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of extracellular phosphate and lanthanum on cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) levels were studied in isolated rat pancreatic acini. In the presence of 1.28 mM Ca2+ and 1.0 mM phosphate, the mean resting [Ca2+]i level was 120 nM. Omission of phosphate from incubation medium significantly lowered this value to 94 nM. The gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) rapidly enhanced both [Ca2+]i levels and 45Ca2+ efflux, irrespective of the presence or absence of phosphate. Lanthanum (0.1 mM), a compound known to block transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes, attenuated both actions of CCK-8, but only in the absence of extracellular phosphate. There was a concomitant decrease in amylase secretion induced by 0.1 nM CCK-8 but not by 10 nM CCK-8, without a significant change in cellular ATP levels. The inhibitory actions of lanthanum on CCK-8-stimulated [Ca2+]i levels were very rapid and were mimicked only by prolonged incubation of acini in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with EGTA. Omission of phosphate from incubation medium also lowered basal [Ca2+]i levels in IM-9 lymphocytes. These findings suggest that extracellular phosphate may modulate resting [Ca2+]i levels in pancreatic acini and other cell types and that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ may partly depend on the availability of a lanthanum-sensitive pool of cell-surface Ca2+ that is not readily removed by EGTA.\r"

Lateral diffusion of Thy-1 was measured in mouse thymocytes, lymphoma cells, and fibroblasts by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. Thy-1 was labeled with rhodamine-conjugated anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies. Diffusion coefficients of 2-4 X 10(-9) cm2/sec were obtained for the antigen-antibody complex in all the cell types. About 50% of the Thy-1 was mobile. The diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction of Thy-1 is considerably larger than the diffusion coefficients of many other plasma membrane proteins. Rather, the diffusion coefficient of Thy-1 is similar to those of lipid analogs embedded in the same membrane, providing strong support for the suggested lipid anchoring of this antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Preincubation of HT29 human colonic adenocarcinoma cells with alpha 2-adrenergic agonists resulted in a 10- to 20-fold increase in forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production as compared to cells preincubated without agonist. Similar results were obtained using either a [3H]adenine prelabeling assay or a cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay to measure cyclic AMP levels. This phenomenon, which is termed sensitization, is alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated and rapid in onset and reversal. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonist, blocked norepinephrine-induced sensitization, whereas prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic) and sotalol (beta-adrenergic) did not. The time for half-maximal sensitization was 5 min and the half-time for reversal was 10 min. Only a 2-fold sensitization of cyclic AMP production stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide was observed, indicating that sensitization is relatively selective for forskolin. Sensitization reflects an increased production of cyclic AMP and not a decreased degradation of cyclic AMP, since incubation with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and forskolin did not mimic sensitization. Increasing the levels of cyclic AMP during the preincubation (using a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) had no effect on sensitization, indicating that sensitization is not caused by decreased cyclic AMP levels during the preincubation. This rapid and dramatic sensitization of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production is a previously unreported effect that can be added to the growing list of alpha 2-adrenergic responses that are not mediated by a decrease in cyclic AMP.\r"

Wap-ras expression was observed in the mammary glands of lactating females in two lines derived from female founders. The tissue-directed and hormone-dependent Wap expression was conferred on the Ha-ras oncogene. The signals governing Wap expression are located within 2.5 kilobases of 5' flanking sequence. The other two lines derived from female founders did not express the chimeric gene. In the line derived from the male founder, the Wap-ras gene is integrated into the Y chromosome. Expression was found in the salivary gland of male animals only. After a long latency, Wap-ras-expressing mice developed tumors. The tumors arose in tissues expressing Wap-ras--i.e., mammary or salivary glands. Compared to the corresponding nonmalignant tissues, Wap-ras expression was enhanced in the tumors.\r"

  ".U": "87147264\r", 
  ".W": "This report describes the induction of cell-type-specific maturation, by dibutyryl-cAMP and testololactone, of neuronal and glial properties in a family of cell lines derived from a rat peripheral neurotumor, RT4. This maturation allows further understanding of the process of determination because of the close lineage relationship between the cell types of the RT4 family. The RT4 family is characterized by the spontaneous conversion of one of the cell types, RT4-AC (stem-cell type), to any of three derivative cell types, RT4-B, RT4-D, or RT4-E, with a frequency of about 10(-5). The RT4-AC cells express some properties characteristic of both neuronal and glial cells. Of these neural properties expressed by RT4-AC cells, only the neuronal properties are expressed by the RT4-B and RT4-E cells, and only the glial properties are expressed by the RT4-D cells. This in vitro cell-type conversion of RT4-AC to three derivative cell types is a branch point for the coordinate regulation of several properties and seems to resemble determination in vivo. In our standard culture conditions, several other neuronal and glial properties are not expressed by these cell types. However, addition of dibutyryl-cAMP induces expression of additional properties, in a cell-type-specific manner: formation of long cellular processes in the RT4-B8 and RT4-E5 cell lines and expression of high-affinity uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid, by a glial-cell-specific mechanism, in the RT4-D6-2 cell line. These new properties are maximally expressed 2-3 days after addition of dibutyryl-cAMP. This indicates that conversion of RT4-AC to the derivative cell types is also a branch point for the regulation of cell-type-specific properties whose expression is responsive to cAMP. Thus, the potential for maturation in response to increased cAMP is a property that segregates in a cell-type-specific manner and is activated at the determinational level in this system.\r"

Considerations of various properties of these sequences, including the number, predicted anticodons, conserved nucleotides, direction of transcription, base composition, and relative gene arrangements are consistent with the interpretation that they are genes for a different sort of tRNA. Transfer RNA genes with a similar potential secondary structure are found in mtDNA of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that this unusual form of tRNA is used by all nematode mitochondria.\r"

We now show that this rearranged WZhet fragment, when introduced stably into lymphoblastoid cells, will activate expression of the complete viral replicative cycle in 1-10% of the lymphoblastoid cells, leading to production of biologically active virions that can immortalize primary lymphocytes. The transfected plasmid appears to be regulated in a manner analogous to the complete Epstein-Barr virus genome.\r"

Mild elastase treatment of lymphoid cells from non-autoimmune (CBA/ca or BALB/c) mice releases a series of crossreactive polypeptides (34, 33, 17, 16, and 14 kDa) recognized by PME77. These polypeptides are not formed after treatment of the same cells with papain or trypsin. When lymphoid cells from autoimmune [MRL-lpr/lpr or (NZB X NZW)F1 B/W] mice are treated with elastase, trypsin, or papain, PME77 detects, in all supernatants, a single polypeptide of about 55 kDa. Antibodies present in the sera of autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr and B/W mice and IgG eluted from kidneys of MRL-lpr/lpr mice react with the same polypeptides. Neither sera nor eluted IgG of normal BALB/c mice react with these polypeptides.

Whereas anti-Gal was found to be present in Old World monkeys and apes in titers comparable to those in humans, its corresponding antigenic epitope is abundantly expressed on erythrocytes of New World monkeys. Immunostaining with anti-Gal of glycolipids from New World monkey erythrocytes indicated that the molecules to which anti-Gal binds are similar to those found in rabbit and bovine erythrocytes. These findings indicate that there is an evolutionary reciprocity between New World and Old World primates in the production of the Gal alpha 1----3Gal structure and the antibody that recognizes it. The expression of the Gal alpha 1----3Gal epitope was evolutionarily conserved in New World monkeys, but it was suppressed in ancestral lineages of Old World primates. The suppression of this epitope was accompanied by the production of anti-Gal. The observed in vivo binding of anti-Gal to human normal senescent and some pathologic erythrocytes implies that the Gal alpha 1----3Gal epitope is present in man in a cryptic form.\r"

  ".W": "Sulfhydryl modification of 22 human erythrocyte enzymes was achieved by exposing intact erythrocytes, hemolysates, and partially purified enzymes to persulfides (RSSH) generated nonenzymatically from cystine in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate and mercaptopyruvate, which donates its sulfur to suitable acceptors with the mediation of the carrier enzyme, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.2). The inhibition pattern was qualitatively similar for persulfides and that previously reported by us for the methylthio-group donor, methyl methanethiosulfonate. Thirteen activities were inhibited, and 9 were minimally or not at all affected. Pyruvate kinase was similarly modified by all systems in terms of phosphoenolpyruvate kinetics, thermostability, and interaction with the negative effector ATP. Partial-to-complete reversal of inhibition was documented in a subset of activities inhibited by mercaptopyruvate upon 30-min incubation with 1 mM dithiothreitol. A possible physiologic role for methylthio groups and for persulfides is discussed.\r"

Hearts were freeze-clamped at 77 degrees K during control perfusion, after 10 min of normothermic global ischemia (no coronary flow), or following post-ischemic reperfusion with oxygenated perfusate. The spectra of these hearts exhibited three different signals with different power saturation and temperature stability: signal A was isotropic with g = 2.004; signal B was anisotropic with axial symmetry with g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005; signal C was an isotropic triplet with g = 2.000 and hyperfine splitting an = 24 G (1 G = 0.1 mT). The g values, linewidth, power saturation, and temperature stability of signal A are identical to those of a carbon-centered semiquinone, whereas those of signal B are similar to alkyl peroxyl or superoxide oxygen-centered free radicals; signal C is most likely a nitrogen-centered free radical. In the control heart samples signal A predominated, whereas in ischemic hearts signal A decreased in intensity, and signals B and C became more intense; with reperfusion all three signals markedly increased. Free radical concentrations derived from the intensities of the B and C signals peaked 10 sec after initiation of reflow. At this time the oxygen-centered free radical concentration derived from the intensity of signal B was increased over six times the concentration measured in control hearts and over two times the concentration measured in ischemic hearts. Hypoxic reperfusion did not increase any of the free radical signals over the levels observed during ischemia. These experiments directly demonstrate that reactive oxygen-centered free radicals are generated in hearts during ischemia and that a burst of oxygen radical generation occurs within moments of reperfusion.\r"

Enkephalin-positive staining in the form of \"woolly fibers\" has been used as a marker for the globus pallidus and its ventral extension. Acetylcholinesterase staining of both fibers and cell bodies, frequently used as a marker for the basal nucleus of Meynert, is also found in the area of the substantia innominata. This study describes the differential distribution of enkephalin-positive woolly fibers and acetylcholinesterase staining on adjacent sections in both the monkey and human basal forebrain area in an attempt to define the relationship between the basal ganglia and the basal nucleus of Meynert. The results show that while both occupy large regions of the basal forebrain, they overlap very little. In both species investigated, dense concentrations of acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons lie, for the most part, outside the boundaries of the pallidal fibers. However, some scattered acetylcholinesterase cells do lie within the confines of the dorsal pallidum, and a more prominent group is found in the subcommissural ventral pallidum. These cells may constitute a group separate from the more densely packed acetylcholinesterase-positive cells in woolly fiber-free regions in that they may receive direct striatal input.\r"

  ".U": "87147285\r", 
  ".W": "Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (2-methylmalonyl-CoA CoA-carbonylmutase, EC 5.4.99.2) is a mitochondrial enzyme whose deficiency in man leads to several biochemically and clinically heterogenous++ forms of methylmalonic acidemia. Intact fibroblasts from 21 patients with mutase apoenzyme deficiency have been pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine or [35S]methionine to determine how amounts of newly synthesized mutase recovered from these cells by immunoprecipitation compare with the amounts of steady-state crossreacting material previously determined. Ten lines (3 mut-, 7 mut 0 ), previously shown to have detectable steady-state crossreacting material, had amounts of newly synthesized mutase that varied from similar (7 lines) to considerably greater than (3 lines) the steady-state amounts. Of 11 lines that had no detectable steady-state crossreacting material, 6 had no detectable newly synthesized mutase, and 5 had amounts of mutase ranging from just detectable to almost half that of control. This result suggests that, at least for this latter group, one effect of the mutation in the mutase gene is to reduce the stability of the mutase protein. We examined fibroblasts from 48 patients with mutase apoenzyme deficiency to determine the sizes of the mature mutase subunit and the mutase precursor accumulated in the presence of the mitochondrial transport inhibitor rhodamine 6G. Of the 38 lines that had detectable newly synthesized mutase, only 2, lines 437 and 552, showed a pattern different from that generated by the normal precursor and mature subunits. Line 437 had two immunoprecipitable precursor proteins in the presence of rhodamine, each of which appeared to be transported and processed in the cells to produce two distinct mature proteins. Line 552 also had two anti-mutase reactive proteins in the presence of rhodamine, but each was smaller than the normal mature subunit and neither appeared to be proteolytically processed. The defect in line 552 is almost certainly an amino-terminal deletion that removes the leader peptide necessary for proper uptake and cleavage of the mutase precursor; this represents a clear example of a natural human mutation that interferes with mitochondrial transport of a protein.\r"

A marked deficiency of all three enzyme proteins was reported in livers from patients with the Zellweger syndrome, a disorder in which peroxisomes are decreased or absent. Peroxisomes are not as markedly decreased in neonatal ALD and appear normal in X-linked ALD. Immunoblot analysis of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes revealed an almost complete lack of the bifunctional enzyme in neonatal ALD liver, similar to the finding in Zellweger tissue. In contrast, acyl-CoA oxidase and beta-ketothiolase were present in neonatal ALD liver, although the thiolase appeared to be in precursor form (2-3 kDa larger than the mature enzyme) in neonatal ALD. Unlike either neonatal ALD or Zellweger syndrome, all three peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes were present in X-linked ALD liver. Despite the absence in neonatal ALD liver of bifunctional enzyme protein, its mRNA was detected by RNA blot analysis in fibroblasts from these patients. These observations suggest that lack of bifunctional enzyme protein in neonatal ALD results from either abnormal translation of the mRNA or degradation of the enzyme prior to its entry into peroxisomes.\r"

Prior antigenic stimulation was not required, since CD4+ cells taken either from healthy persons without anti-HIV antibodies or from individuals with anti-HIV antibodies were capable of inducing cytolysis. Neither CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) nor CD16+ (natural killer) cells mediated the reaction. Light microscopic and autoradiographic studies revealed that, prior to cytolysis, multinucleated giant cells were formed from fusions between HIV-infected cells and large numbers of uninfected CD4+ lymphocytes. These data may explain the paradox that exists in vivo in which a dramatic depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes occurs in the presence of a small number of HIV-infected CD4+ cells. These new insights into the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may lead to future therapeutic strategies.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the isolated nerve endings with a pulse pattern similar to that recorded in vivo from the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons showed that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was not only a function of the applied frequency but also of the duration of the silent interburst intervals. The relationship between the cytoplasmic free Ca concentration and the release of neuropeptides is discussed.\r"

We used a cDNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA and a specific antibody for rat DBI to study in rat brain how the dynamic state of DBI can be affected after protracted (three times a day for 10 days) treatment with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide by oral gavage. Both the content of DBI and DBI mRNA increased in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex but failed to change in the hippocampus and striatum of rats receiving this protracted benzodiazepine treatment. Acute treatment with diazepam did not affect the dynamic state of brain DBI. An antibody was raised against a biologically active octadecaneuropeptide (Gln-Ala-Thr-Val-Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys ) derived from the tryptic digestion of DBI. The combined HPLC/RIA analysis of rat cerebellar extracts carried out with this antibody showed that multiple molecular forms of the octadecaneuropeptide-like reactivity are present and all of them are increased in rats receiving repeated daily injections of diazepam. It is inferred that tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with an increase in the turnover rate of DBI, which may be responsible for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor desensitization that occurs after protracted benzodiazepine administration.\r"

This article describes the cloning of such an enzyme, a peptide acetyltransferase from rat brain that catalyzes the amino-terminal acetylation of endorphins and perhaps other substrates in vivo. Blot-hybridization analysis suggests that the mRNA encoding the acetyltransferase is approximately 2.0 kilobases, is present in whole rat brain and rat hypothalamus, and is slightly larger in mouse AtT20 tumor cells. The acetyltransferase was cloned by using a strategy whereby a cDNA expression library was screened with a solid-phase enzyme-activity assay; this technique combines the use of the substrate coupled to a solid support and subsequent recognition of the product by using a specific antiserum. We have called this method the enzyme immunodetection assay (EIDA). The EIDA should prove useful in the isolation of other clones for proteins that possess enzymatic activity upon expression in bacterial hosts.\r"

These two transcripts lack approximately 70 bases in PLP mRNA from the dysmyelinating jimpy mutant. The deletion spans amino acids 208-232; however, this region is present in the jimpy PLP-encoding gene.

Twenty minutes after addition of the hormone, pHi started to rise and reached a new steady state after about 60 min (delta pHi = 0.28 +/- 0.01). After hormone treatment, pHi recovered significantly faster in response to an intracellular acid load. The diuretic drug amiloride blocked pHi recovery. Experiments in intact tubules showed that aldosterone induces H+ and K+ secretion. Thus, intracellular alkalosis, mediated by Na+/H+ exchange, could serve as a signal that activates pH-sensitive K+ channels of the luminal cell membrane.\r"

Bones most commonly involved were those of the contralateral leg, pelvis, ipsilateral leg, and arms. Focal and mixed lesions seemed to be associated with increased work load on the limb involved. Findings indicated that the more active the patient, the more severe the bone stress. Because of their distribution, appearance, and intensity of tracer uptake, most stress-related lesions were readily distinguishable from bony metastases on scintiscans.

The c-myb proto-oncogene has been mapped to region 6q21-24, which suggests that it could be involved in the 6q- aberrations. By means of in situ chromosomal hybridization on cells from six hematopoietic malignancies, it was demonstrated that the c-myb locus is not deleted, but is retained on band q22, which is consistently bordered by the chromosomal breakpoints in both interstitial and terminal 6q- deletions. The deletion breakpoints were located at some distance from the myb locus since no rearrangement of c-myb sequences was found. In one case, however, amplification of the entire c-myb locus was detectable. Furthermore, in all cases tested that carry 6q- deletions, myb messenger RNA levels were significantly higher than in normal cells or in malignant cells matched for lineage and stage of differentiation but lacking the 6q- marker. These results indicate that 6q- deletions are accompanied by structural and functional alterations of the c-myb locus and that these alterations may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "A confidential self-administered questionnaire was given to all blood donors prior to donation (n = 95,917). The questionnaire describes groups at increased risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and requires the donor to designate his blood either for laboratory purposes or for transfusion. In a previous communication, we reported that donors in the former group had a much higher prevalence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than age, sex and clinic matched controls or a group of \"miscellaneous\" donors who did not fill out the form properly. In this communication, we report results of tests for other viral markers performed on the three designation groups, namely laboratory-designated, miscellaneous and controls. We found that the former two groups had a higher prevalence of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and cytomegalovirus (anti-CMV) than controls, but there were no differences in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels among the groups. In addition, the laboratory-designated group had a higher prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) than the general donor population. These data indicate that a questionnaire designed to ascertain AIDS high-risk donors is valuable in excluding donors who may be carriers of other viruses as well.\r"

The dilution that gave an absorbance (OD) equal to the cut-off OD was considered as the titer of antibody. Sensitivities of the kits were compared by statistical and regression analysis; the same approach was used for studying reproducibility from the results of retesting. The highest titers were found with the Wellcome kit, the lowest with Organon and Pasteur kits, whereas intermediate values were found with the Sorin/Biomedica and Electronucleonics kits. With the Organon and Wellcome kits, excellent reproducibility was observed on later retesting; however, a significant change in titers was seen on retesting the Sorin kit.\r"

The 14 cases were divided into two groups according to their different staining qualities: Group 1 (6) diffuse and Group 2 (8) focal. All six cases of Group 1 were typical hypercellular acute leukemias. Group 2 contained four cases of hypercellular acute leukemia and four cases of hypocellular acute leukemia. All the cases of hypocellular leukemia showed the pattern of focal NSE activity. No difference in the clinical presentation or course of the disease between Groups 1 and 2 was found.\r"

The treatment was started at Days 7 and 14 prior to viral infection and Days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 11 after viral infection. Spleens were analyzed 14 days after viral infection. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Days 0 and 1, few leukemic cells were present in the spleen. Most of them appeared in clumps in the red pulp. No leukemic cells were seen in the white pulp. The white pulp was greatly enlarged. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Day 3, leukemic cells began to spread out in the red pulp and encroached upon the white pulp. The white pulp was enlarged and clearly visible. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Days 7 and 11, many leukemic cells were present in the red pulp. The white pulp was infiltrated by leukemic cells and became less discernible. The morphologic features of the spleen in mice whose treatment was initiated at Day 7 or 14 prior to viral infection were similar to those of untreated groups. Leukemic cells not only filled most of the cordal space in the red pulp but also invaded the white pulp. Many leukemic cells were seen in venous sinuses. When infected mice responded to LF treatment, the general architecture of the red pulp remained intact and the white pulp was enlarged but not infiltrated by leukemic cells.\r"

  ".U": "87155222\r", 
  ".W": "Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) is a common myeloneuropathy with primary and predominant involvement of the pyramidal tract and minimal sensory loss. The epidemic form of TSP is related to toxic nutritional factors, but the endemic form occurs in clusters in tropical areas, especially in India, Africa, the Seychelles, Colombia, and areas of the Caribbean. We describe the clinical and epidemiological features of 25 TSP patients from Martinique (French West Indies) with serum antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Furthermore, all 11 patients who were seropositive for HTLV-I had specific HTLV-I antibodies in their CSF. All were women. The age of onset varied from 25 to 60 years (mean, 45 years). The main clinical features are spastic paraparesis or paraplegia with spasticity of the upper limbs, minimal sensory loss, and bladder dysfunction. Minimal estimated incidence and prevalence are 1 per 100,000 inhabitants per year and 8 per 100,000, respectively. Seventeen percent of the relatives of patients with HTLV-I-associated TSP have HTLV-I antibodies (1 husband and 7 children). In Martinique, the prevalence of HTLV-I antibodies in the general population is about 2% and reaches 10% for neurological disorders other than TSP. Since our initial report, the association between spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I has been confirmed in Jamaica, Colombia, and Japan, suggesting the neurotropism of this lymphotropic human retrovirus.\r"

One hundred and forty four children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia not of the T cell type were randomised to receive continuing treatment with daily 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, and prednisolone six weekly and methotrexate once weekly, either as a single oral dose or an intramuscular injection. Analysis of results with a minimum follow up of three and a half years has shown that the route of administration of methotrexate has had no influence on relapse at any site, but more children receiving intramuscular methotrexate died in remission. These results indicate that oral methotrexate is as effective as intramuscular methotrexate in continuing treatment of lymphoblastic leukaemia.\r"

Evaluation by bone biopsy with histologic and microbiological studies can accurately and promptly diagnose whether bone infection is present. This allows appropriate treatment when infection is present, and prevents unneeded and potentially toxic antibiotic therapy when preliminary studies incorrectly suggest that infection is present.\r"

Fifty-four family members were diagnosed as having definite or probable TS or CMTs. For these 54 subjects, 30% (n = 16) were unaware of tics noted by the examiners and only 18.5% (n = 10) had sought medical care. Our findings suggest that most cases of TS and CMTs are mild and do not come to medical attention. These tic disorders are probably much more prevalent than generally appreciated.\r"

Adverse ocular reactions, including blepharoconjunctivitis and dry eye symptoms, are frequent side effects of this drug. Our previous observation that retinol is present in tears and lacrimal gland fluid suggests that isotretinoin may also be secreted by the lacrimal gland. Rabbits were treated with isotretinoin, and lacrimal gland fluid was collected from the cannulated lacrimal gland duct. Tears were collected from patients who were being treated with isotretinoin. Lacrimal gland fluid and tears were analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and a peak eluted from each sample, which was identified as isotretinoin. We conclude that the lacrimal gland is able to secrete isotretinoin in addition to retinol and that, in animals and patients treated systemically with isotretinoin, the ocular surface is exposed to the drug via the tear film.\r"

Protocols specifying tidal volume or peak inspiratory pressure are difficult to apply for infants and children because of leaks at uncuffed endotracheal tubes, compression loss in ventilators, and inaccuracy of settings for intended tidal volume. To avoid these difficulties, the selection of tidal volume was based on subjective clinical observations: visible chest excursion and audible air entry at least simulating normal breathing. In 76 consecutive patients, use of the guidelines resulted in satisfactory PaCO2 for 97% and PaO2 for 89% of infants and children with a wide variety of respiratory disorders. Adequacy of gas exchange was not related to the patient's age, type of ventilator, tightness of fit of the endotracheal tube, or presence of spontaneous breathing. These results support a simple, versatile method of teaching selection of initial mechanical ventilator settings, relying on clinical judgment for regulation of tidal volume.\r"

Clonogenic cells from six of nine myeloid leukemia cell lines were very sensitive to the effects of TNF with 50% of the colonies inhibited (ED50) by concentrations of TNF that ranged between 6 and 150 U/mL. A decrease in DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and in cloning efficiency occurred within three hours of exposure of HL-60 promyelocytes to TNF. The TNF in combination with recombinant interferons produced an additive or synergistic inhibition of colony formation of HL-60 and THP-1 myelomonoblasts. Normal human CFU-GM are sensitive to TNF (ED50 between 100 and 50,000 U/mL), but their sensitivity to TNF depends on the source of colony stimulating factor (CSF) with T lymphocyte derived GM-CSF (recombinant or natural) partially protecting the CFU-GM from the suppression exerted by TNF (and interferons). In eight of 15 cases the clonogenic myeloid leukemia cells from patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia were more sensitive than normal CFU-GM using GM-CSF as a source of colony stimulating activity. Further studies showed that the action of TNF on myeloid leukemia cells probably can be only partially explained by differentiation. Our finding of a possible selective cytotoxicity to leukemic clonogenic cells by TNF suggests that TNF may have value in the therapy of some patients with myeloid leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "To define the relationship between leukemic cell growth, intracellular metabolism of 1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), and the clinical response to timed sequential induction therapy with ara-C in adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), growth kinetic and biochemical pharmacologic determinants were examined in AML bone marrow populations. Leukemic blasts from 45 previously untreated patients obtained prior to therapy were cultured in vitro in autologous pretreatment serum (APS) and in serum containing drug-induced humoral stimulatory activity (HSA). Cell populations cultured in HSA demonstrated both increased proliferation, as measured by both [3H]dThd incorporation into DNA and [3H]dThd leukemic blast labeling index, and greater [3H] ara-C leukemic blast labeling index relative to cells maintained in APS. HSA-cultured marrow cells from the 31 patients who achieved complete remission with ara-C-containing therapy demonstrated enhanced intracellular formation of ara-C 5'-triphosphate over three hours and retention of this active form during one subsequent hour in drug-free medium relative to cells maintained in APS. In contrast, cells from the 14 nonresponsive patients demonstrated no such HSA-induced increases in intracellular ara-C metabolism. These studies of human AML marrow cells identify behavior patterns of ara-C activation and net metabolism in the kinetically perturbed, proliferative state that may discriminate clinical sensitivity from clinical resistance to ara-C-based timed sequential therapy. Sensitive AML populations behave similarly to normal hematopoietic cohorts, with direct linkage of HSA-perturbed growth and pharmacologic parameters, while refractory cells demonstrate uncoupling of these determinants in the growth-stimulated state. These in vitro measurements may further serve as a template for prediction of clinical outcome to timed sequential therapy with ara-C, where both pharmacologic and cytokinetic determinants of response are intrinsic to the success of the designed drug scheduling.\r"

MNC from leukemic donors at any stage of leukemia (ie, onset or relapse, ON/REL; complete remission or off-therapy, CR/OT donors) were highly susceptible to HTLV-I infection. This was true for acute leukemias of lymphoblastic (ALL) or nonlymphoblastic (ANLL) type. MNC of ON/REL patients were more susceptible to HTLV-I than those of CR/OT donors. In addition, leukemic blasts were more rapidly infected (ie, within five to seven days) than the HTLV-I-susceptible normal cord-blood lymphocytes. However, the presence of circulating blasts was not essential to virus susceptibility, since CR/OT MNC, presumably free of leukemic blasts, were still more susceptible to HTLV-I than normal cells. Basal NK function of MNC from leukemic patients was significantly lower than that detectable in healthy controls. However, no correlation was found between susceptibility to HTLV-I infection and NK activity.\r"

Four of the seven offspring born to the virus-infected mothers seroconverted for HTLV-I when aged 6 to 13 weeks with antibody titers of 1:40 to 1:160. None of the five offspring born to the noninfected mothers became seropositive during the observation period of 6 months, however. Peripheral lymphocytes were cultured with T cell growth factor, and HTLV-I-carrying lymphoid cell lines were established from the four seroconverted rabbits. All four cell lines were of T cells positive for Ia antigens. In addition, none of five newborn rabbits killed immediately after birth to a virus-infected rabbit was infected with HTLV-I. These findings provide an experimental support for the milkborne transmission of HTLV-I from mother to child in humans and indicate that the virus is tropic for T cells in rabbits as well.\r"

Reticulin fibrosis was graded on a scale of 1 to 4. Significant (Grade 3 or 4) fibrosis was noted in 65 patients (47%). Compared with patients with mild (Grade 1 to 2) reticulin fibrosis, those with significant fibrosis had a higher incidence of splenomegaly greater than or equal to 10 cm (29% versus 49%; P = 0.02), hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl (19% versus 49%; P less than 0.01), weight loss greater than or equal to 6.75 kg (10% versus 30%; P = 0.11), marrow blasts greater than or equal to 5% (7% versus 28%; P less than 0.01), peripheral blasts greater than or equal to 3% (30% versus 46%; P = 0.09), and additional karyotypic abnormalities (1% versus 17%; P less than 0.01). The incidence of thrombocytosis was similar in the two groups.

  ".W": "The case histories of 252 adolescent and adult patients with acute leukemia diagnosed and treated between 1975 and 1985 are analyzed with special attention to prognostic factors determining the second complete remission (CR) rate. A first CR was achieved in 65% of cases, 60% for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 75% for lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In 86 patients a relapse occurred (50 AML, 36 ALL), and 50% of them entered a second CR after reinduction therapy. Median survival after first relapse of these reinduction-responders was significantly prolonged in comparison to the reinduction-nonresponders for both AML (15 versus 2 months) and ALL (11 versus 3 months). Median duration of the first CR of the reinduction-responders was significantly longer than that of the second CR (13 versus 6 months). The major determinant for the probability to obtain a second CR after reinduction therapy was the duration of the first CR. The latter was significantly longer in the reinduction-responders than in the nonresponding group (13 versus 5 months). Furthermore patients younger than 40 years, and those who relapsed after ending the maintenance therapy, tended to have better chances to achieve a second CR. Rapid achievement of the first CR, and sex of the patients seemed not to be of predictive value. The authors conclude that aiming for a second CR is worthwhile in young patients who relapse after a long first CR.\r"

Five of the 17 patients showed subjective radiographic evidence of marked shortening of the premolar dental roots; 13 had thinning of the roots. A quantitative analysis was developed and verified, which disclosed a 63.33% to 84.38% reduction of premolar root length when compared with the mean of the historical controls. With recent significant increases in long-term survival rates of children with malignancies, altered dental development becomes an important factor to follow years after chemotherapy is discontinued. The findings of these chemotherapy-associated dental development changes impacts on the patient's quality of life and also can serve as a research tool to assess permanent effects of chemotherapy on normal tissue growth and development.\r"

Treatment was pursued for 2 to 12 months in nine patients in whom SMS was clinically and/or biologically beneficial. In gastrinomas, SMS decreased plasma gastrin in all but one patient, inhibited the residual gastric acid secretion under H2-blockers and improved diarrhea; in the glucagonoma patient, glucagonemia decreased and skin lesions disappeared. In carcinoid syndrome, clinical efficacy was partial and inconstant; daily 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) output was slightly decreased. Plasma substance P levels decreased in six patients with initially high concentrations. No antitumoral activity or side effects have been so far evidenced. SMS 201-995 is a useful, well-tolerated agent in secreting pancreatic apudomas and to a lesser extent in carcinoid syndrome, where high-dosage regimens may be required.\r"

When 6-MP was administered alone, both the peak plasma concentration (15 to 150 ng X ml-1) and the AUC (36 to 340 ng X ml-1 X hr) were highly variable. Concurrent methotrexate resulted in a 31% increase in the AUC (P less than 0.01) and a 26% increase in peak plasma levels (P less than 0.05) of 6-MP. The AUC of methotrexate correlated with the degree of increase in 6-MP plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro studies demonstrating that methotrexate is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that catabolizes 6-MP to the inactive metabolite thiouric acid. Although the increases in 6-MP AUC and peak plasma concentrations resulting from concurrent methotrexate administration were statistically significant, this interaction is probably not clinically significant at standard low oral doses of methotrexate in light of the wide interpatient variability in these pharmacokinetic parameters of 6-MP.\r"

The elimination half-life of enoxacin increased with worsening renal function. In general, patients with diminished renal function had lower plasma enoxacin clearance values than had normal subjects, and a statistically significant correlation between apparent oral clearance and creatinine clearance was observed. Excretion of enoxacin by the kidney accounted for 26% to 72% of the apparent plasma clearance in normal subjects. This was markedly reduced in patients with severe renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-four consecutive patients who had undergone curative resection for colorectal carcinoma were studied prospectively to evaluate the roles of sequential CEA determinations and independent instrumental follow-up in the early detection of resectable recurrences. Fifty-two of these patients also were submitted to sequential determinations of other tumor antigens: TPA (tissue polypeptide antigen) and Ca 19-9 (colon cancer antigen detected with a monoclonal antibody), for a retrospective evaluation of their utility as markers of recurrent tumors. Twenty-two recurrences were detected in a period ranging from 12 to 72 months (median, 47 months). CEA was the best predictor of recurrence (sensitivity, 90 percent) when compared with the other two markers (TPA sensitivity, 60 percent; Ca 19-9 sensitivity, 20 percent). When compared with the instrumental or biochemical examinations of the follow-up, CEA was still the most sensitive indicator of relapse although the specificity was quite low (78 percent) if minimal significative increases were considered. History and physical examination were more useful than CEA in detecting local recurrences in rectal cancer where the preoperative CEA level was low. A few second-look explorations based solely on small CEA increases failed to demonstrate recurrence or revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis. Selected second-look surgery based on demonstrated recurrences resulted in a resectability rate of 57 percent. A follow-up program based on frequent CEA assays, history, and physical examinations, including rectal, vaginal, and perineal exploration, is proposed. Extensive instrumental investigations should follow when a minimal significative CEA rise is observed, or when history and physical examinations suggest a possible recurrence. Second-look surgery should be evaluated after confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of recurrence, on the basis of instrumental or clinical examinations.\r"

A typical regimen is cytarabine 3 g/m2 iv over one to three hours q 12h for a total of 8 to 12 doses. This case report illustrates the neurotoxicity unique to HDARAC. The patient received two cycles of HDARAC over the course of a ten-week period. During the first treatment, dysarthria and ataxia were seen after completion of the patient's eighth and final dose of HDARAC. These symptoms resolved over a period of five days. Six weeks later a more severe syndrome of dysarthria and ataxia developed during a second cycle of treatment. These symptoms worsened over 24 hours despite discontinuation of therapy, then gradually decreased in severity but persisted until his death two months later. The neurotoxicity seen with HDARAC is dose-related and has occurred in up to 60 percent of treated patients. The incidence of cerebellar toxicity approaches 30 percent, with irreversible ataxia reported in up to 16.7 percent. Because the cerebellar toxicity may be worsened by continuation of therapy after initial onset of symptoms, prompt termination of HDARAC is recommended.\r"

Leukotriene C4 was also an effective inhibitor of acid formation in the isolated gastric glands stimulated by histamine or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate without or with addition of indomethacin, indicating that this compound acts directly on the parietal cells without mediation of endogenous prostaglandins. Leukotriene C4 was also an effective stimulant of gastric alkaline secretion. However, this effect was probably mediated by an increase in the generation of endogenous prostaglandin, as it was accompanied by an increase in the luminal release of prostaglandin E2 and indomethacin prevented both the stimulation of alkaline secretion and luminal prostaglandin E2 release by leukotriene C4.\r"

Both De-Nol and sucralfate given orally prevented dose dependently the formation of gastric lesions by these ulcerogens, De-Nol being, respectively, twice and seven times more potent, on a weight basis, than sucralfate. As the gastroprotective activities of both De-Nol and sucralfate on ethanol lesions can be reversed by pretreatment with indomethacin and as De-Nol and sucralfate increase the mucosal generation and luminal release of PGE2, we postulate that mucosal prostaglandins may be involved in the mechanism of action of these drugs on the gastric mucosa.\r"

To determine whether these effects are mediated through the peripheral chemoreceptors, we studied 13 fetal sheep at gestational ages of 127 to 138 days. Seven fetuses had bilateral section of the carotid sinus and vagus nerves (denervated); six had sham operations. Beginning at least 6 days after the operation, we infused PGE2 (0.6 microgram X kg-1 X min-1) into five denervated and five sham-operated fetuses and meclofenamate (0.4 mg X kg-1 X h-1) into six denervated and four sham-operated fetuses. Infusions averaged 20 h in duration. During preinfusion control periods, the incidence of fetal breathing movements (% of time) was lower in denervated than in sham-operated fetuses (18.9% vs. 31.5%; P less than 0.005). In both groups, the incidence of fetal breathing movements was decreased by PGE2 and was increased by meclofenamate; when expressed as absolute values, the magnitude of the changes with both agents was greater in sham-operated fetuses than denervated fetuses. However, the effects were similar in both groups when the changes were expressed as a percent of the respective control values. The incidence of fetal breathing movements (% of control) was decreased by PGE2 to 25.4% in denervated and to 28.2% in sham-operated fetuses and was increased by meclofenamate to 297.3% in denervated and to 304.0% in sham-operated fetuses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The compounds detected by FAB-MS were separated by thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. The sulfated bile acids could be solvolyzed in acidified tetrahydrofuran, and glycine conjugates were partially hydrolyzed by cholylglycine hydrolase. Following solvolysis, deconjugation, and methylation with diazomethane, the bile acids were identified by GC-MS of trimethylsilyl derivatives. The major bile acids in the urine were 3 beta,7 alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid 3-sulfate, 3 beta,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid monosulfate, and their glycine conjugates.

In normal subjects postprandial lipoproteins were present for more than 14 h, and chylomicron levels correlated inversely with lipoprotein lipase activity and fasting high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and nonchylomicron levels correlated inversely with hepatic triglyceride lipase activity. The main abnormality in type IV patients was a 5.6-fold increase in the chylomicron fraction, whereas in type III patients it was a 6.4-fold increase in nonchylomicrons. Type IIa patients had abnormally low chylomicron fractions. In type IV patients gemfibrozil decreased, whereas in type IIa patients cholestyramine increased the chylomicron fraction 66 and 88%, respectively. This study demonstrates an unexpectedly large magnitude and long duration of postprandial lipemia in normal subjects and patients. These particles are potentially atherogenic, and their role in human atherosclerosis warrants further study.\r"

The five glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) heterozygous patients with AML studied manifested only a single G6PD type in blast cells and in most or all granulocyte colony-forming cells, indicating that the leukemias developed clonally. The cells remaining after L4F3 treatment from two of the patients gave rise to granulocytic colonies that expressed the G6PD type not seen in the leukemic clone, indicating that they were derived from normal progenitors (CFU-GM). L4F3-treated cells from these two patients cultured over an irradiated adherent cell layer from normal long-term marrow cultures also gave rise to CFU-GM, which were shown by G6PD analysis to be predominantly nonleukemic. In the other three patients, the progenitor cells remaining after L4F3 treatment were derived mainly from the leukemic clone. The data suggest that in vitro cytolytic treatment with L4F3 of cells from certain patients with AML can enable normal, presumably highly immature progenitors to be expressed.\r"

We explored the molecular mechanisms of TGF beta-mediated stimulation of collagen and fibronectin synthesis in cultured human foreskin fibroblasts. TGF beta preferentially stimulated the synthesis of fibronectin and type I procollagen chains 3-5-fold as shown by polypeptide analysis. Concomitant elevation in the steady state levels of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) coding for type I procollagen and fibronectin also occurred but without a net increase in the rate of transcription of either of these genes. The preferential stabilization of mRNAs specifying type I procollagen and fibronectin provides a partial explanation for the mechanisms by which TGF beta enhances the synthesis of type I procollagen and fibronectin in mesenchymal cells.\r"

There was also a strong correlation between granularity and non-diffuse acid phosphate positivity, but no obvious difference between the 20 patients in their response to treatment emerged during a minimum follow up of 15 months. The \"granular\" variant occurs in around 7% of children with ALL, but has no clear prognostic importance. Morphologists should be aware of its existence and incidence to avoid confusion with acute myeloid leukaemia.\r"

The HLA-A3 gene was therefore mutagenized to replace successively at these positions the HLA-A3-specific aa by the HLA-A2 residues. A single substitution at position 107 of a glycine by a tryptophan residue is sufficient for full expression by HLA-A3 molecules of the HLA-A2/Aw69 shared antigenic determinant without modification of the other serological reactivities characteristic of the HLA-A3 molecules. Previous studies of ethyl methanesulfonate mutants having shown the involvement of aa 161 in this determinant, we assume that the two aa residues 107 and 161 are close to each other.\r"

Using a rabbit model of pneumococcal meningitis, we sought to reduce this inflammatory process. The ability of the pneumococcal cell wall to cause death and to generate leukocytosis and abnormal chemistry in cerebrospinal fluid was prevented when animals were treated with inhibitors of cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonate metabolism. Bacterial lysis by ampicillin led to release of cell wall that caused a significant, transient increase in meningeal inflammation. This inflammatory burst was also prevented by administering cyclooxygenase inhibitors concurrently with the antibiotic.\r"

At parturition, 14 groups of 4 rats each were fed diets containing 20% fat, with mixtures of coconut and safflower oils providing seven concentrations of 18:2 ranging from 3.6 +/- 0.5 to 44.5 + 2.3% of total fatty acids. Hydrogenated soybean oil was added such that 18:1t comprised 10.3 +/- 0.3% of total fatty acids. Milk samples were collected on day 12 postpartum for prostaglandin analyses and on day 16 for fatty acid analyses. The relationship of dietary 18:2 to milk 18:2 was linear (r = 0.98; P = 0.0001), with milk 18:2 ranging from 2.6 +/- 0.1% of total fatty acids at the lowest level of dietary 18:2 to 27.9 +/- 1.6% at the highest. Milk 18:1t was highly correlated (r = 0.99; P = 0.0001) with the amount of dietary 18:1t. In rats fed hydrogenated fat, milk 18:1t averaged 7.0 +/- 0.2% of total fatty acids. Transfer from diet to milk was 46.4 +/- 4.2% for 18:2 and 37.5 +/- 1.7% for 18:1t. Mean concentrations of prostaglandin F2 alpha and E in rat milk were 269 +/- 16 pg/mL and 477 +/- 24 pg/mL respectively. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of either prostaglandin relative to 18:1t consumption at any level of 18:2.\r"

For two popularly used face masks taped to a facial moulage, recovery of the tracer particle by an in vitro system was very low. When the masks were placed in the manner in which the product is commonly worn, however, significantly higher numbers of particles were recovered. Passage of inspired air around the periphery of two types of face masks appears to circumvent the masks' ability to screen airborne contaminants.\r"

The anesthetized animals underwent tracheostomy and were placed inside a body plethysmograph. Respiratory compliance and resistance were calculated from airway pressure and simultaneous flow, and volume was measured with a pneumotachograph. Gas trapping was measured as the change in volume observed in the plethysmograph after clamping the jet or the oscillatory line at respiratory rates of 10 and 15 Hz and tidal volumes of 1.0 and 2.0 mL/kg. Mean airway pressure was similar with both ventilators. Inspiratory/expiratory ratios were 1:4 at 10 Hz and 1:2 at 15 Hz with HFJV, and 1:1 during HFOV. Under all conditions, gas trapping was significantly greater with HFJV than with HFOV. More gas trapping was observed with higher tidal volume (2 mL/kg) and respiratory rate (15 Hz) during HFJV, before and after meconium instillation. After meconium instillation, gas trapping during HFJV at 15 Hz and tidal volume 2 mL/kg decreased significantly (32.7 +/- 10.4 to 24.9 +/- 10.3; P less than 0.05), compared with basal conditions. This finding may be explained by the shorter time constant of the respiratory system after meconium instillation (0.118 vs 0.083 seconds, P less than 0.01). Thus gas trapping was significantly greater with HFJV than with HFOV, a difference most likely related to the active expiratory phase of HFOV.\r"

The mesotheliomas, irrespective of cell type or grade, showed lower gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) concentration than 36 of the 38 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The mean concentration of this enzyme in the 15 mesotheliomas was an eighth of that in the 56 carcinomas, whereas their DNA content was similar. The quantitative correlation of thymidine kinase (TK), uridine kinase (UK), and phosphoserine phosphatase to mitotic frequency was highly significant for mesotheliomas, as well as for carcinomas. As estimated from their TK [and its recently established quantitative correlation to volume doubling time (DT)], the DT of the 16 mesotheliomas ranged from 50 to over 700 days, with a somewhat longer median than the median for pulmonary carcinomas. Subject survival, though shortest for the 2 sarcomatous mesothelioma cases, varied over an overlapping range for mesotheliomas with epithelial or mixed cell type. The biopsy samples' TK and UK concentrations, however, showed a significant inverse correlation with months of survival after diagnosis. Survival time after the first appearance of symptoms decreased linearly (on log scales) with TK concentration (P less than .001) over the 14 cases. The results of this first quantitative study of a spectrum of biochemical constituents of mesotheliomas identify GGT as an enzyme whose measurement guards against mistaking mesotheliomas and adenocarcinomas for one another and show that the TK concentrations of these mesothelioma samples bear a highly significant, inverse correlation to the postdiagnosis survival time of the individual subjects.\r"

The serum bioassayable hormone levels in the benign breast disease patients (74.0 +/- 77.6 ng/ml) were significantly higher (P less than .001) than in normal women (23.8 +/- 10.7 ng/ml). There were no significant differences in the radioimmunoassayable prolactin or growth hormone levels between the 2 groups. When 16 cystic breast disease patients were placed on a low-fat (20% of total kilocalories) diet for 3 months, there were significant reductions in the serum bioassayable hormone levels (P less than .02). It is concluded that the bioactivity of prolactin may be elevated in the serum of patients with cystic breast disease and cyclic mastalgia, without corresponding increases in levels determined by radioimmunoassay; that this abnormality is reversible by a reduction in dietary fat consumption to 20% of the total kilocalories; and that serum prolactin may provide a valuable biomarker in clinical trials of a low-fat diet in women at high breast cancer risk.\r"

  ".W": "Uncertainties in quantitative assessment of cancer risk limit the scientific role of this activity in the policy and regulatory debate on cancer control. Risk-assessment strategies and models are highly dependent on the nature and quality of the data available. However, accumulating laboratory and epidemiologic studies that are shedding new light on mechanisms of carcinogenesis have not yet been integrated into current risk-assessment models. Future developments in risk assessment may, therefore, be anticipated by considering the type of epidemiologic data that may soon be generated. Three important areas of epidemiologic and biochemical research should reduce some of the uncertainty in quantitative risk assessment by making it possible to: identify stages of the disease process through precursor lesions, biochemical markers, and to determine at which stage the carcinogen acts; identify subpopulations that are at enhanced or reduced susceptibility to carcinogenic influences; and obtain additional and refined indices of dose. Much of this research is being called \"biochemical epidemiology.\" Strategies for incorporating these newly generated data into regulatory decisions vary from developing new mechanistically based mathematical models to applying existing models to biologically distinct subpopulations.\r"

  ".W": "Data from nine population-based cancer registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program from 1973 through 1982 were analyzed to determine the demographic correlates of the incidence of the four major histologic types of cancer of the small intestine: carcinomas, malignant carcinoid tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. These tumors were uncommon: The average annual incidence per million persons was 3.9, 2.9, 1.6, and 1.2, respectively. The age-specific incidence rate for each type was quite low through middle age, after which it rose sharply. Males experienced higher rates than females for each of the four histologic types. Blacks were at a 40-70% greater risk than whites for the occurrence of carcinomas and carcinoid tumors but at a 50% lower risk for lymphomas. The reported incidence of malignant carcinoid tumors increased during the decade under study, the rate at the end of the interval being 50% greater than that at the beginning. The extent to which this increase represents improved detection of these tumors or a change in the criteria separating malignant from benign tumors could not be evaluated. There was no change in the incidence of carcinomas, lymphomas, or sarcomas of the small intestine. The four histologic types varied considerably with regard to their proportional distribution among the subsites of the small intestine. Carcinoid tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas rarely occurred in the duodenum, whereas nearly half of the carcinomas were found there. Eighty-seven percent of the carcinoid tumors and 60% of the lymphomas occurred in the ileum. Clues to the etiologies of tumors of the small intestine are sparse. The incidence data presented here suggest that at least some of the etiologies will differ among the histologic types.\r"

The chromosomal number ranged around 46, and no karyological abnormality was found in G-band karyotyping. When heterotransplanted into the subcutis of BALB/c nude mice, HUOCA-II cells produced a poorly differentiated clear cell adenocarcinoma. The tumor angiogenesis factor (TAF) of a molecular weight of about 14,000 was purified from the conditioned medium of HUOCA-II cells, and neovascularization was detected by bioassay with the use of the chorioallantoic membrane of a chick embryo. This TAF also stimulated the growth of endothelial cells in an in vitro culture system.\r"

For both sets the reported diagnosis was translated to International Classification of Disease for Oncology terminology and then to the Working Formulation (WF). Comparison of the WF diagnoses between the FARM study and the SEER Program showed disagreement in 68 of 290 cases (23.4%). Apparent causes of disagreement were as follows: coding errors-9 cases, unconventional or ambiguous terminology on reports resulting in different interpretation of the NHL subtype--30 cases, differences in coding rules for the FARM study and SEER Program--9 cases, acquisition of different reports with different diagnoses on the same case by the FARM study and SEER Program--20 cases. Several corrective measures that might successfully decrease the incidence of disagreement include: education of pathologists in the use of conventional terminology, and use of the category \"unclassifiable\" when abstracting reports with unconventional or ambiguous terminology. This 23.4% disagreement rate in the abstracting method adds to the known problem of nonconcurrence in the pathologic diagnosis of subtypes of NHL.\r"

Oral administration of beta-carotene (120 micrograms/mouse/day) for 9 days from day 1 to the BALB/c mice inoculated sc with 10(7) syngeneic BALB/c Meth A fibrosarcoma cells (Meth A) led to a remarkable rejection against rechallenged Meth A implanted sc on day 10. The growth of Meth 1 fibrosarcoma (Meth 1), another syngeneic tumor of BALB/c origin, as a rechallenge tumor was unaffected by treatment with beta-carotene, thereby suggesting that beta-carotene may augment tumor rejection specific to tumor-specific antigens. Winn assay revealed that the suppressive effect on tumor growth of immune lymph node cells obtained from Meth A-inoculated beta-carotene-treated mice on day 12 was enhanced dose dependently. Primary effector cells responsible for the augmented rejection are Thy-1-positive, Lyt-1-negative, and Lyt-2-positive lymphocytes, presumably cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.\r"

While 20 of 20 untreated subclones of T984-15 produced tumors when injected into BALB/c nude mice, 14 of 15 T984-15 subclones that were treated for 24 hours with 5 micrograms 5-azaC/ml displayed suppressed tumorigenesis under identical conditions. Of the 14 clones that were suppressed, 12 were nontumorigenic and 2 showed a greatly increased latency. Chromosome analyses of 5-azaC-treated nontumorigenic clones revealed that, in contrast to untreated tumorigenic controls (median chromosome number 49-59), 9 of 10 5-azaC-treated nontumorigenic clones analyzed displayed an elevated chromosome complement (68-94 chromosomes/cell). The increase in chromosome number occurred progressively with time, following a single 24-hour 5-azaC treatment, indicating that 5-azaC was not selecting for a subpopulation of cells with an elevated chromosome complement. The evidence that the hypomethylating agent 5-azaC can suppress a cell's tumorigenic potential and that this suppression correlates with increased chromosome number suggests that 5-azaC modulates cellular phenotypes by mechanisms that involve alterations in a cell's chromosome complement.\r"

Pretreatment of exponentially growing CHO cells with 1 microgram Sm/ml for 3 or 5 hours decreased [3H]leucine incorporation by 20% and resulted in significant resistance to cisplatin (P = .005). Sm in a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml reduced [3H]leucine and [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation after 3 hours by 92 and 84%, respectively, and resulted in potentiation of the cisplatin cytotoxicity (P = .004). This effect was the same in the case of nonproliferating cells (P = .005), while protection due to Sm (1 microgram/ml) was seen only during cell proliferation. Simultaneous incubation and postincubation with Sm proved to have much less or no potentiating effect on cisplatin. The mechanisms of both protection and potentiation are still not clear, but our data indicate that Sm is a promising drug for further studies on the modulation of the cancer cell response to classical anticancer drugs.\r"

In vitro cultured CT38LD cells were more sensitive to DOX than CT26. In vivo DOX and DOX-Lip, administered iv 10 mg/kg weekly to a maximum of five injections, increased the life-spans of mice bearing CT38LD liver metastases 32% (P less than .05) and 64% (P less than .05), respectively.

Fish 6-10 days old were exposed to concentrations of MAM-Ac up to 100 mg/liter for 2 hours. Exposed specimens were transferred to carcinogen-free water and sampled periodically for tumor development. Pancreatic neoplasms occurred in approximately 9% of histologically examined individuals exposed to 10 mg MAM-Ac/liter or less. Neoplastic lesions were not found in 122 control specimens. The neoplasms included 6 cases diagnosed as adenoma, 7 cases diagnosed as acinar cell carcinoma, and 2 cases diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Adenomas consisted mainly of well-differentiated acinar cells that were filled with zymogen granules. Two adenomas also contained foci of atypical, less-differentiated acinar cells possessing basophilic, fibrillar cytoplasm. Acinar cell carcinomas occurred in several cellular patterns that ranged from well-differentiated to more anaplastic lesions; however, none exhibited areas of ductular proliferation. Adenocarcinomas, on the other hand, exhibited a glandular growth pattern and contained numerous ductlike structures. Both types of carcinomas appear to arise from primary acinar cells. Thus lesions probably progress from adenomas to acinar cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. The findings of carcinogen-induced pancreatic neoplasms in guppies further strengthen the usefulness of small fish species in carcinogen testing and provide an additional model for pancreatic tumors.\r"

The spontaneous metastasis of the highly metastatic tumor designated 410.4 was inhibited by oral administration of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (INDO), whereas treatment of mice with the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) delayed tumor growth but did not affect the rate of spontaneous metastasis. Lung colony formation was dramatically reduced by poly I:C treatment following iv tumor cell inoculation (experimental metastasis), whereas oral INDO had no significant effect. Suppression of natural killer cell activity with anti-asialo GM1 (asGM1) antibody increased lung colony-forming ability of mammary tumor lines with either high, moderate, or low metastatic capacity. Although pretreatment of the recipient with INDO did not alter the incidence of experimental metastasis, culture of the tumor cells with INDO (1 micron) prior to iv inoculation inhibited the appearance of lung colonies by greater than 90%. This beneficial effect was dependent on an asGM1-positive population. These results suggest that in this murine mammary tumor system, prostaglandin synthesis contributes to metastatic capacity and that the beneficial effects of INDO may be attributable, in part, to the enhancement of tumor cell sensitivity to natural cytotoxic effector mechanisms.\r"

Strain differences were reported in the relative proportions of tumors derived from each cell type when these tumors were examined 14 weeks after urethan treatment. For determination as to whether these proportions changed at later stages of growth, tumors in A/J, SWR/J, RIIIS/J, BALB/cByJ, 129/J, and C57BL/6J mice were examined at 28 and 56 weeks after urethan treatment. Tumor multiplicity increased with time in all strains. Small tumors were predominantly type II cell derived in most strains, whereas medium and large tumors were derived mainly from Clara cells. This suggests that type II tumors are restricted in growth while Clara tumors may continue to grow. Medium and large Clara-derived tumors made up a larger proportion of the total tumor population at 28 and 56 weeks than at 14 weeks post urethan, even in A/J mice that typically display 85% type II cell-derived tumors at the earlier time. Several large Clara cell-derived tumors exhibited characteristics of cancer, whereas no type II cell-derived tumor was observed to do so. These results implicate the bronchiolar Clara cell as the predominant cell of origin of pulmonary adenocarcinomas in mice.\r"

These cells were cultured up to the 10th passage, equivalent to 60 cell divisions in culture. They were then tested for normality by several criteria, namely, the ability to regrow into normal mammary glands after implantation into cleared mammary fat pads of both syngeneic and nude mice, chromosome numbers, and response to mammogenic hormones. The cultured cells did form normal mammary ducts after implantation. The fraction of fat pads with ductal outgrowths as well as the size of the outgrowths was proportional to the number of cells implanted. When 10(6) cells were implanted into BALB/c mice, 83% of the fat pads contained outgrowths, filling, on the average, approximately 87% of the fat pad. More ductal outgrowths occurred from implanted cells taken from lower tissue culture passages than from high ones, and the number of outgrowths was greater in BALB/c mice than in nude mice. A small fraction of the cells in culture reacted with antibodies to casein, but there was no evidence of alpha-lactalbumin in the cells. However, ductal outgrowths from implanted cells responded to hormone stimulation of an estrogen deoxycorticosteroid pellet by forming well-developed lobulo-alveolar structures characteristic of pregnancy. Of the cells that were studied in passages 3 and 7, 85% were diploid. An abnormally growing culture in passage 10 was composed of cells in the tetraploid range. These tetraploid cells formed normal mammary ducts when implanted into animals.\r"

When examined for effects on spontaneous metastasis, dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine had no effect on metastasis to draining lymph nodes in either BL6 or 3LL tumors. However, the restriction did reduce metastasis of RT7-4bs cells to draining lymph nodes by 60%. In all tumor systems, the dietary restriction effectively inhibited the subsequent growth of lymph node tumors. The most marked effect of the dietary restriction was on spontaneous hematogenous metastasis, which was almost totally blocked for BL6 cells and was reduced by 85% for RT7-4bs cells. Tumor-associated splenomegaly also was completely inhibited in 3LL tumor-bearing mice. The selective dietary amino acid restriction failed to reduce initial lung colonization in the experimental metastasis assay but clearly inhibited subsequent tumor outgrowth in the lungs. These findings demonstrate that modification of host nutritional status by restriction of the dietary intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine exerts a dramatic antimetastatic effect directed particularly on spontaneous hematogenous metastasis. Although the preliminary data suggest a primary modulating effect on tumor cell populations growing in diet-restricted animals to reduce inherent metastatic ability, the actual mechanisms remain to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "The appearance of pyloric gland-type cells with a low pepsinogen isozyme 1 (Pg 1) content in the stomach mucosa of F344/Du rats during stomach carcinogenesis was examined by a combination of paradoxical concanavalin A (Con A) staining and immunohistochemical staining for Pg 1. Male F344 rats were given drinking water containing 100 micrograms N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine [(MNNG) CAS: 70-25-7]/ml for 30 weeks and then normal tap water and were killed in week 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 70. Untreated rats were killed in week 30 or 70. Serial sections of pyloric mucosa were stained by paradoxical Con A staining and Pg 1 immunostaining. After MNNG treatment, tissues showing changes were classified into normal-looking pyloric mucosa with a low Pg 1 content, mucosa showing atrophic or hyperplastic changes, adenomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma. From the results of paradoxical Con A staining and Pg 1 immunostaining, the cells in lesions were classified into gastric types (surface mucous cell type and pyloric gland cell type) and intestinal types (intestinal-absorptive cell type and goblet cell type). In this experiment, the cells in lesions were mainly of the gastric cell types. All pyloric glands of control rats in weeks 30 and 70 contained class III mucins and had a high Pg 1 content demonstrated immunohistochemically. After MNNG treatment, class III mucin-positive pyloric glands with a low Pg 1 content in normal-looking pyloric mucosa were found from week 10; subsequently, their number increased with time. Changed mucosa was found from week 20, and the area of cells of the pyloric gland cell type with little or no Pg 1 in changed mucosa was about 30% of the area of cells of the pyloric gland cell type. Adenomatous hyperplasias were found from week 30; adenocarcinomas were found from week 50. Almost all cells of the pyloric gland cell type (greater than 95%) in areas of adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas had little or no Pg 1 content. The present results suggested that the appearance of pyloric glands with a low Pg 1 content in normal-looking mucosa might be an immunohistochemically detectable preneoplastic change preceding morphologically detectable preneoplastic changes in stomach carcinogenesis.\r"

The phenotype frequencies of HLA-DR3 (52 vs. 23%) and HLA-B8 (46 vs. 24%) showed a significant increase in the IMN patient group compared to those of controls from the same region. The supraphenotype in which the combination of DR3-B8 alleles in Bf SS homozygotes occurred was significantly more common in the patient group than in the controls. A subset of six individuals carrying antigens DR3, B8, and common Bf*S alleles was identified, and the clinical course of those patients was found to be significantly worse compared to the rest of the patients. The present results do not support the existing suggestion that the clinical course of these diseases in Caucasians is determined by antigens B18 and the rare Bf allele (Bf*F1). It seems likely that IMN is not a single disease but a renal lesion that can result from several combinations of genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli.\r"

This slower rise in anti-HIV prevalence coincided with a fall in the annual gonorrhoea rate from 15.3% in 1982 to 5.1% in the first half of 1986 in the same male homosexual clinic population. Over the same period a reduction in the number of sexual partners and a change to safer sexual practices has been documented among homosexual and bisexual men taking part in a prospective study of the natural history of HIV infection. These data support the value of continuing preventive efforts to control viral spread in the absence of an effective vaccine or therapy.\r"

At the higher doses of AZT tested, the virustatic activity observed seemed to have a synergistic virustatic relation with ampligen. Thus, combined therapy with ampligen and AZT can be expected to be more beneficial than AZT alone to patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex since AZT regimens that seem to be clinically effective are associated with considerable toxicity.\r"

Memory problems in the third decade initiate a progressive dementia, leading to death in the sixth decade. Laboratory investigations failed to disclose a biochemical basis for the syndrome. Preliminary molecular linkage studies have been conducted, and although the specific position of the responsible gene on the X chromosome has not yet been determined, the q26-qter region and much of the p arm are unlikely sites for this gene.

Two patients underwent biopsies of lesions that proved to be granulocytic sarcomas. AMML with inversion 16 carries a much higher (33%) incidence of CNS involvement in the form of leptomeningeal metastasis and/or granulocytic sarcoma than all other acute nonlymphocytic leukemias (5%).

Similar numbers of daily wear and extended wear soft contact lens wearers presented with acute complications. The highest incidence of severe microbial keratitis was found in patients wearing soft contact lenses on an extended-wear basis. Inappropriate topical steroid therapy was implicated as a major factor contributing to the severity of these cases. Less severe sequelae of contact lens-related complications were also over-represented in the extended lens wear group. These findings emphasize the need for a conservative approach to the use of an extended wear regimen with soft contact lenses.\r"

Through use of a polyclonal antiserum, nucleolin cDNA clones were isolated from a Chinese hamster ovary cell library constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11. The isolated cDNAs encoded a polypeptide containing 679 residues of the 713 amino acids of nucleolin. The amino acid sequence presents several unusual features: in particular, repetitive sequences are found at both ends of the molecule. A repeat, Hy-Thr-Pro-Hy-Lys-Lys-Hy-Hy, in which Hy is a nonpolar residue, is found six times in the NH2-end proximal portion, followed by three acidic stretches containing 25, 25, and 33 glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues. Four potential phosphorylation sites (serines) are also observed in this region. The COOH-terminal proximal portion of the protein carries a glycine-rich region with fairly regularly interspersed phenylalanine and dimethylarginine residues. The two terminal portions of the molecule exhibit unique potential secondary structures: alpha-helix (NH2 terminus) and extended (COOH terminus). The central region exhibits alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches. Five potential N glycosylation sites are detected. The structure of this protein may reflect two functions in preribosome biogenesis: interaction with chromatin (NH2 terminus) and with preribosomes (COOH terminus).\r"

The presence of ubiquitin-activating enzyme in excess of Ub by approximately equal to 0.1 microM assures that the steady state will be close to the endpoint for total Ub. A preparation of the activating enzyme from human erythrocytes that does not depend on affinity chromatography is described. Several applications of the assay are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The structure of the complex between carboxypeptidase A alpha (EC 3.4.17.1) and the ketonic substrate analogue 5-benzamido-2-benzyl-4-oxopentanoic acid (BOP) has been determined by x-ray crystallographic methods to a resolution of 1.7 A (final R = 0.191). Interestingly, BOP was observed to bind to the active site of carboxypeptidase A alpha as the covalent hydrate adduct. Because BOP is probably less than 0.2% hydrated in aqueous solution, this result was unexpected. One possibility is that the zinc-bound water of the native enzyme added to the ketone carbonyl. Alternatively, the enzyme may preferentially scavenge the hydrated ketone as it is continuously maintained at equilibrium in the solution in which the carboxypeptidase A alpha crystals were immersed. In either case, this mode of binding of BOP to carboxypeptidase A alpha provides an example of the preferred binding of a model of a structure along the reaction coordinate of a hydrolytic reaction.\r"

As a result, these sugars are capable of preserving the integrity of dry liposomes and membranes. Since these effects could conceivably be due to the presence of small amounts of water in the dry preparations of sugar and lipid, we have done careful measurements of the residual water contents in the dry samples and report the results here. Lyophilized liposomes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (9:1) contain at most 0.2 mol of H2O per mol of lipid. When the trehalose concentration in the dry mixtures is increased, there is no increase in the apparent water content of the samples over a wide range of sugar concentrations. Over the same range of trehalose contents the maximal effect of trehalose on physical properties of the lipids and on stabilization of liposomes is achieved. We conclude that the stabilization does not require retention of residual amounts of water in the dry trehalose-phospholipid preparations. Similar studies with other sugars show a relationship between the amount of sugar interacting with the lipid and the ability of the same sugar to stabilize dry liposomes.\r"

Quantitative fits to the data indicate that the root-mean-square configurational deviation of the atoms surrounding the terbium ion is 0.2 A, in good agreement with other measurements. We further point out that because the protein seems to undergo a glass transition yet retains configurational order at room temperature, the proper name for the physical state of a protein at room temperature is the rubber-like state.\r"

  ".W": "The structure of DNA in aqueous trifluoroethanol solutions containing more than 70% (vol/vol) trifluoroethanol, where it has been proposed to have the A-conformation, has been studied by the technique of electric linear dichroism. The data demonstrate that both linear phi X174 DNA [5386 base pairs (bp) long] and a 172-bp fragment of sea urchin 5S RNA gene are in the double-helical A-form in the alcoholic solution and that two of the important structural parameters, the base tilt and the base-pair translation along the helical axis, are the same as in the A-form structure of crystalline double-helical d(GGTATACC). Despite its molecular length, the limiting reduced dichroism (-1.41) of the phi X174 DNA in low-salt aqueous solution is near the theoretical limit (-1.50) for DNA with base planes perpendicular to the helical axis. Transformation of this DNA and also of the 172-bp fragment to the A-structure in alcohol solutions reduces the experimental value of the dichroism to about -1.04, which agrees almost exactly with the value of -1.03 calculated for the A-form crystal. The base-pair translation along the helical axis was determined from relaxation of the DNA dichroism when the electric field is turned off. The 172-bp fragment is found to have a base-pair translation of only 2.6 A in the A-structure and is thus the same as in A-DNA fibers and in the A-form oligomers crystals. We conclude from the coincidence of the base-pair translation and the apparent values of the base tilt that the A structures are identical or nearly so in the solution and solid states. Comparison of the phi X174 data with data on smaller DNA fragments and with the data on the 172-bp sea urchin gene fragment unambiguously confirms that, in aqueous solution, the experimental reduced electric dichroism of B-DNA is highly dependent on molecular length, while the dichroism of the A-DNA form in alcoholic solutions is independent of molecular length at least in the range from 172 to 5386 bp.\r"

Our experiments indicate that Z-DNA forms are present in a specific set of sites on the native chromosomes. They occur on interbands and other subdivisions of dispersed DNA, but there is no correlation between the amount of Z-DNA detected and DNA compaction. The results suggest, moreover, that Z-DNA forms are restricted to specific genes, because various subdivisions induced to transcription in puffs show different patterns of Z-DNA. We show, in addition, that removal of chromosomal proteins by proteinase K has a strong influence on the level of anti-Z-DNA reactivity.\r"

Genomic probes that recognized an mRNA of about 2 kilobases in human cells were used to isolate from a cDNA expression library two cDNA plasmids that could efficiently transform ts11 cells to a non-ts phenotype. Sequencing of one of these cDNAs revealed a single open reading frame, which could encode a 540 amino acid protein. The ts11 gene has at least two other homologs in human DNA and thus it appears to be part of a small gene/pseudogene family. Experiments with serum-synchronized cells indicate that the expression of the ts11 gene, which is necessary for G1 progression, is itself cell-cycle regulated, being induced in approximately mid-G1.\r"

Two cDNA clones complementary to rat entactin mRNA were isolated by antibody screening of an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library constructed in the lambda gt11 expression vector. One of the clones, lambda 1E, was subcloned into plasmid pBR322 and further characterized. The clone contained sequences complementary to an mRNA species 6 kilobases in length. This mRNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates to yield a polypeptide of 143 kDa that was precipitated with anti-entactin antiserum. The cDNA insert, 1328 base pairs long, was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 729 base pairs that coded for 243 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of entactin. Analysis of the peptide revealed no extended alpha-helical or beta-sheet secondary structures. Radiolabeled probes prepared by nicktranslation of p lambda 1E were used to monitor the steady-state levels of entactin mRNA in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells that were induced to differentiate by exposure to retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The increase in steady-state levels of entactin mRNA lagged behind the increase in mRNA for the B2 chain of laminin, suggesting that laminin and entactin are independently rather than coordinately regulated.\r"

The sequence predicts a protein of 261 amino acids (Mr 29,261) with a high content of acidic (41, aspartic and glutamic acids) versus basic (24, lysine and arginine) amino acids. The identity of the cDNA clone was confirmed by in vitro hybrid-arrested translation of cyclin mRNA. Blot-hybridization analysis of mouse 3T3 and human MOLT-4 cell RNA revealed a mRNA species of approximately the same size as the cDNA insert. Expression of cyclin mRNA was undetectable or very low in quiescent cells, increasing after 8-10 hr of serum stimulation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea in serum-stimulated cells did not affect the increase in cyclin mRNA but inhibited 90% the expression of H3 mRNA. These results suggest that expression of cyclin and histone mRNAs are controlled by different mechanisms. A region of the cyclin sequence shows a significant homology with the putative DNA binding site of several proteins, specially with the transcriptional-regulator cAMP-binding protein of Escherichia coli, suggesting that cyclin could play a similar role in eukaryotic cells.\r"

We have investigated whether the first of those morphological changes, swelling of the secretory granule, precedes--and therefore possibly initiates--secretion or whether it occurs after fusion of the granule and plasma membranes. We used cell membrane capacitance to detect the moment when granule and plasma membrane become continuous. We measured large capacitance increases, often preceded by transients in capacitance. The rise-times of the capacitance increases were half-maximal at 2-59 msec. We observed cells with high-resolution video microscopy while these measurements were done. The capacitance increase always preceded the granular swelling that leads to exocytosis. To rule out the possibility that fusion was induced by a mechanical stress imparted by the internal pressure of a taut granule, we performed control experiments using cells in which vesicles were shrunken with hyperosmotic solutions. With these flaccid granules, again, the capacitance rise always preceded the swelling of the granules. We conclude that swelling cannot be the driving force for membrane fusion in this system.\r"

This particle was partially purified by sedimentation in sucrose gradients containing 0.5 M KCl, and some of its physical properties and its behavior during early development were determined. The prosome sediments between 16 and 19 S and has a buoyant density of 1.30 g/cm3 in Cs2SO4 gradients. Biochemically, the particle is characterized as 20-25 polypeptides of molecular size 24-35 kDa with about 10 small RNAs. A monoclonal antibody directed against the 27-kDa protein of duck erythroblast prosome recognizes a 27-kDa protein of the sea urchin prosome. We have used this protein, as representative of the prosome, to immunologically determine the level and the subcellular localization of the particle during development. Immunoblotting and cellular fractionation studies show that the 27-kDa prosome polypeptide is present almost entirely in the postribosomal supernatant of unfertilized egg lysates. After fertilization and during early development, the total amount of 27-kDa protein per embryo remains constant, but the amount in the postribosomal supernatant decreases; there is a concomitant increase in the level of the 27-kDa protein in a rapidly sedimenting, particulate fraction containing nuclei. Immunofluorescence studies further show that the 27-kDa protein is located mainly in the cytoplasm of eggs and two-cell embryos. The subcellular location of the prosome, therefore, appears to change during development. In vivo labeling experiments have failed to detect the synthesis of either the prosome proteins or RNAs in eggs and embryos up to 48 hr of development, suggesting that this cytoplasmic particle is not synthesized de novo in early embryogenesis and thus is metabolically stable. The prosome is thus a normal cellular constituent of the sea urchin and is most likely synthesized during oogenesis and stored in the unfertilized egg.\r"

In the present study, we examined the expression of the gene encoding POMC during testicular development and in other tissues of the male reproductive system. We also analyzed the effects of cellular interactions on POMC gene expression in the testis. Blot-hybridization analysis revealed that POMC transcripts of approximately equal to 800 nucleotides were present in enriched populations of meiotic prophase spermatocytes and in caput epididymis but were absent in cauda epididymis and vas deferens. POMC transcripts were present in fetal testis (day 17 of gestation to newborn), could not be detected in prepuberal testis (days 7-8 postpartum), but reappeared in the adult testis. No difference in the size or abundance of POMC transcripts was seen in testes from mouse mutant strains in which spermatogenesis is arrested in early spermiogenesis. In contrast, POMC transcripts were virtually undetectable in testes that are devoid of germ cells. These results emphasize the importance of interactions between germ cells and interstitial cells and the regulation of the POMC gene in the mammalian testis.\r"

To assess patterns of heteroduplex repair in mammalian cells, we constructed 13 different heteroduplexes from simian virus 40 wild-type and deletion mutant DNAs. Each heteroduplex contained one or multiple single-stranded loops in the intron of the gene for large tumor antigen, which is not essential during lytic infection. After transfection into cultured monkey cells, cellular repair was evaluated by restriction analysis of the amplified viral progeny from 1123 individual plaques, each representing the clonal expansion of a single repair event. Single-stranded loops were corrected prior to replication with an overall efficiency of 90%. At the position of a loop, one of the two heteroduplex strands served as a template for accurate repair 98% of the time. Repair of single-stranded loops was biased nearly 2 to 1 in favor of the strand without the loop. The efficiency, accuracy, and strand bias of repair were unaffected by loop size within the tested range, which was 25-247 nucleotides.

Pedigree and recombinational analysis establish the marker order as being Hprt-FIX-c11-G6PD-St14-1. The size of this contiguous region is such that the X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mouse mutation probably maps within this segment. This in turn suggests that it is highly improbable that the mouse mdx locus represents a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is, however, compatible with the idea that this mutation may correspond in man to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. The high frequency of restriction fragment length polymorphisms found in this interspecific system for all the human cross-reacting probes examined up until now, using only a limited number of restriction enzymes, suggests that the Mus spretus mapping system may be of great potential value for establishing the linkage relationships existing in man when conserved chromosomal regions are concerned and human/mouse cross-reacting probes are available or can be obtained.\r"

This variant clone expresses H-2Kb, H-2Db, and H-2Kd molecules. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the variant was heterozygous at the H-2K, I, and S loci but had lost the H-2Dd and H-2Ld genes. Karyotype analysis showed that neither of the chromosome 17s in the variant had undergone detectable deletions. Quantitative Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the variant had two copies of the H-2Db gene, whereas the parental cell line had one copy of H-2Db. The loss of the H-2Ld and H-2Dd genes, accompanied by the attainment of homozygosity at H-2Db, is consistent with a recombination between the two chromosome 17 homologues. We conclude that although mitotic recombination between homologues has been difficult to demonstrate, it may not be infrequent and may account for the development of mutant genotypes in somatic cells in vitro. Such a mechanism occurring in vivo could result in the emergence of cells that are homozygous for deleterious alleles even though the individual may be constitutionally heterozygous.\r"

We have described the cloning of a cDNA encoding the protein component of an Ly-6 molecule. Hybridization studies indicated that this cDNA identified multiple DNA fragments on Southern blots. The banding pattern exhibits a restriction fragment length polymorphism from mice bearing either the Ly-6a or the Ly-6b allele. We have employed three independent chromosomal mapping techniques, somatic cell hybrids, in situ hybridization, and strain distribution pattern analysis of the restriction fragment length polymorphism of DNA from recombinant inbred lines, to ascertain the chromosomal origins of these bands. We report that all members of the Ly-6 multigene family are tightly linked on chromosome 15 and have been regionalized by in situ hybridization analysis to band 15E on the distal portion of this chromosome. Linkage analysis has indicated that the Ly-6 genes are located within 1 map unit of Env-54 (a retroviral envelope restriction fragment length polymorphism probe), 3 map units from ins-1, (insulin-related gene), and 4 map units from the protooncogene c-sis. The possible involvement of the Ly-6 lymphocyte activation and differentiation antigen genes in chromosome 15-related lymphoid malignancies is discussed.\r"

Contrary to earlier preliminary findings with a limited number of enzymes, the RFLP appears to be quite extensive both with the DP beta (14 different DNA markers defined by individual fragments or clusters thereof) and the DP alpha (8 markers) probes, especially when enzymes recognizing only four base pairs were used. A few markers were absolutely or strongly associated with individual DP antigens, whereas most were associated with two or more DP antigens as defined by primed lymphocyte typing. Thus, Southern blotting seems feasible for typing for most DP determinants by specific fragments or subtraction between the various more broadly reactive DNA markers, and the RFLP provides further information on the DP subregion in addition to that provided by primed lymphocyte typing. In two recombinant families, the DP beta and DP alpha DNA markers segregated with DP antigens, whereas the DR beta, DQ beta, DQ alpha, and DX alpha markers followed the DR and DQ antigens.\r"

At physiological levels found in human saliva, gustin activated cAMP PDEase 5- to 6-fold. Activation of PDEase occurred with as little as 500 ng of gustin. Comparative sensitivity of activation of PDEase by gustin was intermediate between calmodulin and lysophosphatidylcholine with maximal activation and half-maximal activation (indicated in parentheses) at 3 X 10(-8) M (4.3 X 10(-9) M), 3.4 X 10(-6) M (3.4 X 10(-7) M), and 2.5 X 10(-3) M (4.0 X 10(-5) M) for calmodulin, gustin, and lysophosphatidylcholine, respectively. No other major salivary protein activated PDEase. Anticalmodulin antibody completely inhibited calmodulin-activated cAMP PDEase activity, but the antibody had no effect on gustin-activated cAMP PDEase activity. A sensitive calmodulin RIA indicated that no calmodulin was detected in any gustin preparation that activated cAMP PDEase. Both gustin and calmodulin rendered cAMP PDEase thermally labile to a similar extent and increased Vmax without affecting the apparent Km for the substrate cAMP. Activation by gustin and calmodulin was unaffected by lubrol-PX, trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin A, or leupeptin. In the presence of 1 mM EGTA, gustin activated cAMP PDE 5- to 6-fold, but the activating ability was completely lost after gustin was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 min. In contrast, calmodulin lost all activating ability in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, whereas heating calmodulin at 100 degrees C for 5 min did not affect its activation of cAMP PDEase. Lysophosphatidylcholine-activation of cAMP PDEase, like gustin activation, was unaffected by EGTA, but lysophosphatidylcholine-activation of cAMP PDEase, like calmodulin activation, was unaffected by heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min.\r"

In CA1, B6E11 was effective only when applied to the apical dendrites synapsing with the potentiating input. The production of LTP could not be blocked if B6E11 was applied to the cell bodies or to the basal dendrites of CA1. In field CA1, B6E11 had no effect on the production of short-term potentiation. Another monoclonal antibody from the same panel as B6E11, of the same immunoglobulin class, which also binds to hippocampal neurons similarly to B6E11, had no effect on LTP production. These results supply evidence that B6E11 modulates LTP by an interaction with a specific cell-surface protein associated with the dendrites of neurons in both dentate gyrus and CA1 regions.\r"

The internal timekeeping mechanism of the circadian pacemaker in the nuclei continued to oscillate unaffected by this treatment, although the toxin reversibly blocked function of both the input pathway for pacemaker entrainment and an output pathway for expression of the circadian drinking rhythm. Thus, Na+-dependent action potentials appear necessary for entrainment and expression of overt circadian rhythms, but they do not seem necessary for the pacemaker to keep accurate time. The experimental approach presented in this paper is useful because it allows systematic assessment and distinction of the input, pacemaker, and output components of a mammalian circadian timekeeping system in vivo.\r"

Using the tyrosine hydroxylase probe, we ascertained the specificity of the labeling over catecholaminergic cells by denervation experiments and comparison of the hybridization pattern with that of immunoreactivity. The use of 35S-labeled probe enabled the hybridization signal to be resolved at the cellular level. A single injection of reserpine into the rat led to an increase of the intensity of the autoradiographic signal over the locus coeruleus area, confirming an RNA gel blot analysis.

The library was constructed from olfactory mucosa poly(A)+ RNA enriched for OMP mRNA and cloned into a pBR322-derived plasmid, pMG5. OMP cDNA clones were detected by using a 17-base oligonucleotide probe that contained all 16 possible sequences coding for a known partial amino acid sequence of rat OMP. The identity of these clones was confirmed by hybrid-selected translation and nucleotide sequencing. The sequence of one clone was determined and contained the complete OMP coding region of 486 nucleotides followed by 1630 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region. The 3' untranslated region included the polyadenylylation signal 16 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail. No other ATG-initiated open reading frame larger than 20 codons was present in register. RNA blot analysis of olfactory mucosa poly(A)+ RNA using this clone as a probe indicated that the level of OMP mRNA, but not its size, declined significantly within a few days following olfactory bulbectomy. OMP mRNA was not detected in 14 nonolfactory rat tissues. Surprisingly, a small amount of OMP mRNA was observed in olfactory bulb. The presence of OMP mRNA in olfactory bulb was confirmed by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. These results suggest either that a previously undescribed population of neurons in the olfactory bulb synthesize OMP or that OMP mRNA is transported to the bulb by axonal transport.\r"

The maximum accumulation ratios of both amino acids (intracellular [amino acid]/extracellular [amino acid]) remained largely unaltered. Treatment with neuraminidase affected neither the synaptosomal energy levels nor the concentration of internal potassium. It is suggested that the gamma-aminobutyric acid and acidic amino acid transporters are glycosylated and that sialic acid is involved in the operation of the carrier proteins directly and not through modification of driving forces responsible for amino acid uptake.\r"

Elemental imaging of thin freeze-dried cryosections from fresh cerebellar slices frozen within 20 sec of removal from the brain showed normal concentrations of potassium (95 +/- 6 mmol/liter wet tissue +/- SEM) and calcium (0.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) in whole presynaptic terminals, even though mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial sites containing up to 30 mmol of calcium per liter were present elsewhere in the neuropil. Quantitative electron probe analysis of synaptic vesicle clusters and intraterminal mitochondria indicated that their calcium concentrations were 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 1.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter, respectively. The low calcium content of presynaptic organelles was confirmed by the absence of detectable deposits in preparations freeze-substituted so as to stabilize calcium content. Similar experiments were carried out on cerebellar slices rapidly frozen after incubation in vitro. The distribution of potassium and calcium in presynaptic terminals of resting and depolarized (55 mM potassium) slices was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that in freshly excised cortex, although resting slices lacked the few calcium-rich sites that appeared in other areas of the neuropil after stimulation. The calcium concentrations in whole terminals, synaptic vesicles, and mitochondria of resting slices were 1.4 +/- 0.7, 0.7 +/- 0.2, and 0.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter, respectively. Thus, amounts of calcium typical of storage organelles in other tissues are not present within cerebellar synaptic vesicles, suggesting that they have a limited role in calcium storage and release.\r"

For each class of substrate the products closely parallel those that result from their enzymatic oxidation by cytochrome P-450. Because of the close congruence of products, the catalytic nature of the Fe(III)Cl3/H2O2 reaction mimic, and the similarity of the dipolar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile) to the proteinaceous lipid matrix of the biomembrane, the form of the reactive intermediate may be the same in each case. A mechanism is proposed in which an initial Lewis acid-base interaction of Fe(III)Cl3 with H2O2 generates a highly electrophilic Fe(III)-oxene species as the reactive intermediate. This is in contrast to the prevailing view that cytochrome P-450 acts as a redox catalyst to generate an Fe(V)-oxo species or an Fe(IV)-oxo cation radical as the reactive intermediate.\r"

Proteins from crude cytosolic or nuclear extracts were electrophoresed on NaDodSO4/PAGE gels, soaked in a urea buffer to remove NaDodSO4, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with nick-translated MMTV [32P]DNA in a 5% nonfat dry milk buffer, which minimizes nonselective DNA-protein interactions. We present evidence that MMTV [32P]DNA interacts selectively with the glucocorticoid receptor. These data include comigration of [3H]dexamethasone mesylate-labeled band and bound MMTV [32P]DNA on gel electrophoresis systems; localization of DNA-binding activity in the cytosol of cells incubated with steroid at 0 degrees C and in the nucleus and cytosol of cells incubated at 37 degrees C; binding of the MMTV DNA to highly purified receptor; and absence of MMTV DNA binding activity in extracts from cells whose receptor has been down-regulated. Furthermore, glucocorticoid receptors analyzed under these conditions exhibit selective binding to DNA fragments that contain glucocorticoid regulatory elements.\r"

  ".W": "Norepinephrine and its closely related analogues, dopamine and epinephrine, are transported into chromaffin cells in culture by two distinct types of sites on the plasma membrane: one is sensitive to cocaine while the other is not. The cocaine-sensitive site has a high affinity for catecholamines and depends on sodium in the medium. The apparent Km for norepinephrine uptake by the cocaine-sensitive site is 5.8 microM when determined in the presence of 118 mM NaCl, obtained using nonlinear least-square curve fitting. Detailed kinetic analysis has also shown cocaine to be a competitive inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake with an apparent Ki of ca. 1 microM. This site is blocked by a series of tricyclic antidepressant drugs with relative potencies characteristic of norepinephrine transport sites in neurons. In contrast, the cocaine-insensitive site(s) have a low affinity for norepinephrine (apparent Km, approximately 88 microM) and are also able to transport catecholamine analogues such as dimethyl-epinephrine and isoproterenol, which have bulky groups attached to the amine moiety. Transport of norepinephrine at both sites is blocked by low temperature, by mitochondrial uncouplers, and by other metabolic inhibitors. Both of these transport sites in the chromaffin cell plasma membrane, therefore, appear to be different from the well-characterized catecholamine transport sites in the chromaffin granule membrane on the basis of substrate specificity and their sensitivity to inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "lambda-Tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III), a photoactivated DNA-cleaving agent, is a small molecular probe of DNA structure. Because of its chirality, the complex cannot bind to regular right-handed B-form DNA but exhibits site-specific cleavage along the polymer strand at conformationally distinct sites such as those in a left-handed conformation. Both coarse and higher resolution mapping experiments using the chiral cobalt complex indicate intriguing conformational variations along the simian virus 40 genome. Highly specific cleavage is evident in the enhancer and promoter blocks and in the region downstream of 3' termini. A specific cleavage pattern borders an alternating purine/pyrimidine stretch within the enhancer, which was found earlier to bind anti-Z-DNA antibodies. Throughout the simian virus 40 genome, variations in structure delineated with the cobalt complex appear to correlate with regions important for control of gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional structure of human milk lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family, has been determined crystallographically at 3.2-A resolution. The molecule has two-fold internal homology. The N- and C-terminal halves form two separate globular lobes, connected by a short alpha-helix, and carry one iron-binding site each. Each lobe has the same folding, based on two domains of similar supersecondary structure, with the iron site at the domain interface. Each iron atom is coordinated by four protein ligands: two tyrosines, one histidine, and one aspartate. A probable CO3(2-) (or HCO3-) ion is suggested by the electron density, bound to iron and adjacent to an arginine side chain and a helix N terminus. The protein folding and location of the binding sites show marked similarities with those of other binding proteins, notably the sulfate-binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium.\r"

  ".U": "87175560\r", 
  ".W": "The base-pairing interactions of promutagenic O6-methylguanine (O6-MeGua) with cytosine and thymine in deuterated chloroform were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Nucleosides were derivatized at hydroxyl positions with triisopropylsilyl groups to obtain solubility in nonaqueous solvents and to prevent the ribose hydroxyls from forming hydrogen bonds. We were able to observe hydrogen-bonding interactions between nucleic acid bases in a solvent of low dielectric constant, a condition that approximates the hydrophobic interior of the DNA helix. O6-MeGua was observed to form a hydrogen-bonded mispair with thymine. Whereas O6-MeGua did not form hydrogen bonds with cytosine (via usual, wobble, or unusual tautomeric structures), it did form a 1:1 hydrogen-bonded complex with protonated cytosine. The pairing of unprotonated cytosine in chloroform is thus consistent with the known preference of O6-MeGua for thymine over cytosine in polymerase reactions. In contrast, the pairing of protonated cytosine is consistent with the greater stability of oligonucleotide duplexes containing cytosine.O6-MeGua as compared with thymine.O6-MeGua base pairs [Gaffney, B. L., Markey, L. A. & Jones, R. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5686-5691]. Our observation that cytosine must be protonated in order to pair with O6-MeGua suggests that the cytosine.O6-MeGua base pair in DNA is stabilized by protonation of cytosine. Through this mechanism, methylation at the O6 position of guanine in double-stranded DNA could promote cross-strand deamination of cytosine (or 5-methylcytosine) to produce uracil (or thymine).\r"

The clones, including one containing the entire coding region, hybridize at high stringency to a single band of poly(A)+ RNA of length 4.8 kilobases. The subunit coded for by the clones was identified by in vitro transcription of the cDNA followed by translation of the resulting RNA. The DNA sequence of the clones contains a single long open reading frame (1626 nucleotides) coding for a protein of 542 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60,333, the amino-terminal half of which is homologous to several other protein kinases. Potential ATP- and calmodulin-binding domains were identified. Two independent clones contain an identical 45-nucleotide deletion, relative to the clones described above, resulting in a shorter open reading frame coding for a protein of molecular weight 58,000. This suggests that the minor, 58-kDa beta' subunit of the type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase may be synthesized on a separate message.\r"

One cell line, HAFTL-1, expresses antigenic markers characteristic of B-lymphoid cells and undergoes frequent rearrangement at the JH locus (where J = joining and H = heavy chain) during propagation in culture. By molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence determination, these rearrangements were found to represent the earliest postulated step in heavy chain gene assembly: the joining of a diversity (D) segment to a JH segment. The HAFTL-1 cell line also undergoes infrequent D beta-to-J beta joining at the T-cell receptor beta locus in culture. The observations presented here suggest that the HAFTL-1 cell line represents the early stage of B-cell differentiation at which immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is initiated.\r"

  ".W": "Following carcinogen exposure in vitro, normal rat tracheal epithelial cells are transformed in a multistage process in which the cultured cells become immortal and, ultimately, neoplastic. Five cell lines derived from tumors produced by neoplastically transformed rat tracheal epithelial cells were examined for the expression of 11 cellular oncogenes previously implicated in pulmonary or epithelial carcinogenesis. RNA homologous to fms was expressed at a level 5-19 times higher than normal tracheal epithelial cells in three of five of the tumor-derived lines. All three lines expressing high levels of fms-related RNA gave rise to invasive tumors of epithelial origin when injected into nude mice. Increased expression of the fms-related mRNA was not due to gene amplification, and no gene rearrangement was detected by Southern analyses. RNA blot analysis using a 3' v-fms probe detected a 9.5-kilobase message in the three tumor-derived lines, whereas both normal rat alveolar macrophages and the human choriocarcinoma line BeWo expressed a fms transcript of approximately 4 kilobases. We conclude from these data that the gene expressed as a 9.5-kilobase transcript in these neoplastic epithelial cells is a member of a fms-related gene family but may be distinct from the gene that encodes the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) receptor.\r"

N., Zmudzka, B. Z. & Wilson, S. H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3536-3543].

  ".W": "The generation and characterization of ubiquitin (Ub)-aldehyde, a potent inhibitor of Ub-C-terminal hydrolase, has previously been reported. We now examine the action of this compound on the Ub-mediated proteolytic pathway using the system derived from rabbit reticulocytes. Addition of Ub-aldehyde was found to strongly inhibit breakdown of added 125I-labeled lysozyme, but inhibition was overcome by increasing concentrations of Ub. The following evidence shows the effect of Ub-aldehyde on protein breakdown to be indirectly caused by its interference with the recycling of Ub, leading to exhaustion of the supply of free Ub: Ub-aldehyde markedly increased the accumulation of Ub-protein conjugates coincident with a much decreased rate of conjugate breakdown. release of Ub from isolated Ub-protein conjugates in the absence of ATP (and therefore not coupled to protein degradation) is markedly inhibited by Ub-aldehyde. On the other hand, the ATP-dependent degradation of the protein moiety of Ub conjugates, which is an integral part of the proteolytic process, is not inhibited by this agent. Direct measurement of levels of free Ub showed a rapid disappearance caused by the inhibitor. The Ub is found to be distributed in derivatives of a wide range of molecular weight classes. It thus seems that Ub-aldehyde, previously demonstrated to inhibit the hydrolysis of Ub conjugates of small molecules, also inhibits the activity of a series of enzymes that regenerate free Ub from adducts with proteins and intermediates in protein breakdown.\r"
