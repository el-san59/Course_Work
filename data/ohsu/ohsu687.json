  ".W": "In a case-control study of factors contributing to hypothermia all fourteen patients (mean age 80 years) admitted to hospital with hypothermia after being found ill indoors also had some other serious illness. They were more likely than control patients to have been alone when taken ill (93 vs 39% of controls), to live alone (86 vs 43%), and to have been found on the floor (79 vs 14%). They were less likely to have been wearing more than indoor clothing (0 vs 50%), or to have had heating on when found (50 vs 89%), but 93% of patients in both groups had heating available. Healthy young adult volunteers who lay immobile on the ground in air at 5 degrees C lightly clothed cooled progressively by 0.57 degrees C (SD 0.32) (rectal T degrees) in 90 min despite doubling of metabolic rate. With better insulation in bed, core temperature stabilised within 90 min, and when they were in an armchair it fell slowly, with no increase in metabolic rate in either case. The findings suggest that hypothermia indoors resulted largely from collapse due to illness when the patient was alone lightly clothed and not in bed. Eight hypothermic patients found outside (in December and January) were younger (mean age 60 years) than the fourteen found indoors; six of these were chronic alcoholics or acutely intoxicated, and six lacked, or had wandered from, a fixed home.\r"

A unique experience with laryngotracheal reconstruction in 203 children is reviewed. The majority (194) of the cases were classified as acquired; only nine were classified as congenital. Excluded from the study were those cases of stenoses managed endoscopically, all resections and end-to-end anastomoses, all anterior cricoid split procedures, and all cases of anterior glottic stenosis repaired by a laryngeal keel. The degree of stenosis was graded into four categories. Five different methods of laryngotracheal reconstruction were used depending on the pathologic lesion in the larynx and trachea. Of the 203 children, 186 (92%) were decannulated. The results support the use of laryngotracheal reconstruction in children with grades 2, 3, and 4 laryngeal stenosis.\r"

The incidence of complications was 13% (18/135). Airway problems comprised 77% (14/18) of these complications, resulting in one death. There were three postoperative hemorrhages and one postoperative arrhythmia. Comparison of the complication group versus the noncomplication group showed a statistically significant difference in the minimum oxygen saturation (66% vs. 79%) and apnea index (75 vs. 57) on the pre-operative sleep study and in the amount of narcotic administered intraoperatively. Patients with intubation complications tended to be heavier, whereas patients with extubation complications received significantly more narcotic analgesia intraoperatively. Risk for a perioperative complication was not related to age, type of obstructive symptoms, medical problems, or concurrent septoplasty/tonsillectomy. A protocol for perioperative airway management is presented.\r"

Six arose from the ethmoid sinus and 48 from the maxillary sinus. Of the maxillary sinus patients, 11 presented with T1 or T2 lesions, 20 with T3, 16 with T4, and 7 of these had nodal disease. Treatment was surgery and/or radiation therapy. There was local recurrence in 25 of 48 maxillary sinus patients and in 1 of 6 ethmoid patients. Overall 5-year survival was 38.2% in the maxillary sinus group: T1, 100.0%; T2, 85.7%; T3, 31.8%; and T4, 6.7%. Three of six patients with ethmoid tumors were cured. There was a statistical trend for better prognosis in those patients presenting with ethmoid primaries, with early lesions, treated with both radiation and surgery, and with history of inverting papilloma. There were complications of treatment in 10 patients, four of which resulted in death. Local control was the major problem for these patients; therefore, early detection and aggressive local treatment are desirable.\r"

  ".W": "Immune-mediated inner ear disease, by convention called autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), has established clinical profile guidelines for diagnosis. Treatment consists of steroid and/or cytotoxic drug immunosuppression. The role of plasmapheresis (PMP) in the treatment of AIED has not been defined. Lack of a precise serological marker prevents accurate immunological understanding. Definition is, of course, difficult in a disease whose natural history is not well delineated. Successful use of PMP in one steroid and cytotoxic drug intolerant patient with AIED led to its use in a total of eight patients. The rationale for PMP was based on its known effectiveness in other autoimmune diseases and thus, its potential use in AIED. Improved auditory function occurred in 6 of the 8 patients, 3 of whom have been followed for over 3 years. Three of the six no longer require immunosuppressant medication. PMP can be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy in AIED. These preliminary results suggest PMP can stabilize or improve auditory and vestibular symptoms in selected patients. Its use as a first line therapy followed by cytotoxic immunosuppressants bears consideration.\r"

The hearing sensitivity of the trainmen did not differ significantly from that of the control population. Multiple regression analysis, which considered separately the effects of age and years of service, showed significant differences in hearing levels due to age, but no differences in hearing levels due to years of service. Evaluation of the data by risk categories developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health indicate that this group of trainmen had no risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss. These analyses, combined with studies of locomotive cab noise, show clearly that trainmen are not typically exposed to hazardous occupational noise.\r"

Fifty consecutive patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis lacking surgical indications by traditional work-up comprise the patient population. Sixty percent had endoscopic or CT indications for surgery. There was a 90% correlation between endoscopy and CT examination with the combined work-up being more accurate than either modality alone. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed in 18 cases. There were no major complications. Approximately 89% of the postoperative group report significant improvement, with 55.6% reporting total relief of symptoms. A complete endoscopic sinus work-up can often identify surgically correctable sinusitis despite normal routine rhinoscopic and plain-film examination. It is therefore, warranted in those patients with a suggestive history.\r"

All rhinoplasties were performed by residents under the supervision of staff otolaryngologists. A 4-point scale was used to assess the extent of periorbital edema and ecchymosis at 24 hours postoperatively. A one-time bolus of 10 mg of dexamethasone was beneficial in decreasing edema and ecchymosis in rhinoplasty. This benefit was demonstrated statistically (p less than .005). No complications were attributed to the administration of dexamethasone.\r"

Test results showed that patients who had suffered from bilateral atresia had permanent olfactory deficits, while the patient who had suffered from unilateral atresia appeared to have normal olfactory acuity. Although these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of cases examined, they suggest the possibility that early sensory exposure might be needed for the normal development of central olfactory functions in analogy to the visual system.\r"

Reports of levator injury following orbital, ocular, and adnexal surgery, as well as in cataract and blepharoplasty procedures, are well described. In most cases eventuating in complete ptosis, levator disinsertion is the anatomic correlate, the ptosis is usually permanent, and surgical intervention is often indicated. We have observed two cases of transient, complete post-traumatic ptosis which have recovered by 6 weeks with expectant management. We believe this entity to be more pervasive than the current literature seems to reflect and emphasis is placed on nonoperative therapy. This paper reviews the anatomical considerations relevant to the function of the levator complex as well as the possible mechanisms for its injury.\r"

Twelve patients with rhabdomyosarcoma involving the temporal bone were treated between 1966 and 1988. Three patients were treated according to the IRS-I protocols and the remaining nine patients received various combinations of treatment modalities. Ten patients succumbed to their disease, most with distant metastases or intracranial extension. Two patients are alive; one at 5 1/2 years and one at 19 years. It is apparent that, although survival for rhabdomyosarcoma in general has improved with the use of IRS-I protocols, prognosis remains poor for disease involving the temporal bone and other parameningeal sites.\r"

Therefore, a formal program is being proposed, which will be reviewed by mixed groups over a period of time.

The relationship between laser energy delivered, the laser delivery characteristics, and the lesion size was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of laser injury on several hematologic and hemodynamic parameters was studied. Programmed electrical stimulation studies were performed to assess the proarrhythmia potential of laser injury of the myocardium. The results showed the depth and diameter of myocardial injury to be directly related to total laser energy applied. Both depth and diameter of injury were increased by multiple applications of laser energy to the same myocardial location. One-half to full thickness left ventricular injury was produced without perforation or embolization. Endocardial vaporization occurred only with laser powers higher than necessary to produce full-thickness injury. There was no sustained effect on the hemodynamic or hematologic variables studied, nor were proarrhythmia effects identified. The laser injury produced in these studies was of smaller magnitude than might be necessary for clinical arrhythmia ablation, and the lack of sustained hemodynamic effects and pro-arrhythmia potential needs to be verified in subsequent studies with larger laser lesions. The results support continued evaluation of catheter-directed laser injury of the myocardium as a potential method for elimination of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the optimal laser power (watts) for maximal strength of argon laser vascular fusions by measuring bursting pressures of repairs. Longitudinal incisions (n = 105) measuring either 2.5 or 5 mm in length were performed in canine femoral, carotid, and jugular veins and arteries and were fused with the argon laser at 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9 W power. Total exposure time for each repair (50 to 80 sec/0.5 cm) was adjusted to yield identical energy fluences of 1,100 J/cm2. Bursting pressure of the fusions was determined by monitored infusion of anticoagulated blood into an isolated segment of the vessel that contained the fusion. Mean bursting pressures for venous and arterial repairs were significantly higher in the 2.5 mm incisions compared with the 5 mm incisions (P less than 0.05). Venous and arterial repairs of equal length performed at each power resulted in equivalent bursting strengths, except that 5 mm venous segments fused with 0.9 W withstood lower pressures than all other venous repairs (P less than 0.05), and 5 mm arterial segments were in turn significantly weaker at 0.3 W (P less than 0.02). We conclude that argon laser fusion is equally suitable for repair of medium-sized veins and arteries and that immediate strength decreases with increasing length of repair. To maximize strength of longer repairs, venotomies should be welded at power settings between 0.3 and 0.7 W while arteriotomies should be fused at power settings between 0.5 and 0.9 W. The differences in optimal power may be explained by variable wall composition and thickness between veins and arteries.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the long-term effects of Nd:YAG laser photoirradiation in 17 canine ureteral orifices, comparing results of the contact and noncontact (free-fiber) techniques. The noncontact technique damaged four of eight ureters, causing ureteral obstruction with significant hydronephrosis in three and reflux in one. The amount of energy used correlated with the subsequent appearance of ureteral obstruction; obstruction developed in both cases when 3,000 and 3,300 joules were used but in only one of five cases when less than 2,300 joules were used. In contrast, the contact technique, using 350-800 joules, caused no hydronephrosis and only one case of reflux. Since these animal studies clearly document that the Nd:YAG laser may significantly damage the ureter, particularly when the noncontact technique is used, we recommend that the surgeon consider the contact technique to reduce the risk of ureteral damage and use the smallest amount of energy required for adequate tumor eradication when treating tumors in or near the ureteral orifice.\r"

Extracellular matrix components from untreated and laser-welded skin and blood vessels were extracted with guanidine hydrochloride and separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When compared with matched, untreated tissues, protein electrophoretic profiles from laser-treated samples showed several changes. In both tissue types, argon laser treatment decreased the concentration of a 235 kd protein that migrates between the alpha and beta chains of type I collagen. Laser-treated blood vessels showed significantly more low molecular weight protein at the dye front than in control tissue, whereas significantly more high molecular weight protein appeared in laser-treated skin samples when compared with untreated tissue. These results suggest that the argon laser may either degrade or crosslink proteins in vivo. Laser-induced protein crosslinks may be the biochemical basis of argon laser welding.\r"

In this study an established macrophage-like cell line (U-937) was used. The cells were exposed in culture to the following wavelengths of light: 660 nm, 820 nm, 870 nm, and 880 nm. The 820-nm source was coherent and polarised, and the others were non-coherent. Twelve hours after exposure the macrophage supernatant was removed and placed on 3T3 fibroblast cultures. Fibroblast proliferation was assessed over a 5-day period. The results showed that 660-nm, 820-nm, and 870-nm wavelengths encouraged the macrophages to release factors that stimulated fibroblast proliferation above the control levels, whereas the 880-nm wavelength either inhibited the release of these factors or encouraged the release of some inhibitory factors of fibroblast proliferation. These results suggest that light at certain wavelengths may be a useful therapeutic agent by providing a means of either stimulating or inhibiting fibroblast proliferation where necessary. At certain wavelengths coherence is not essential.\r"

We have studied 22 adults (6 men) with XLH to clarify these aspects of this most common inherited form of rickets and osteomalacia. Most study participants had presented with rickets in early childhood and had undergone tibial osteotomies on at least 1 occasion. Seventeen individuals had genu varum, 1 had genu valgum, and 4 had straight legs, attributable to successful osteotomies in 2. Five subjects reported increasing lower limb deformity in the late teens or subsequently. Eight subjects complained of bone pain, 6 of whom had radiologic evidence of pseudofractures; pseudofractures were found in 4 additional asymptomatic individuals. None of 16 subjects who underwent transiliac bone biopsy had normal double tetracycline labeling; accordingly, all were considered to have osteomalacia. Bone pain was associated with a relative osteoid volume in excess of 25%. Relative osteoid volume was inversely related to serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration (r = -0.74, p less than 0.02), but unrelated to serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate or their product. Eighteen participants complained of joint pain, predominantly in the knees and ankles. The severity of joint pain correlated with the degree of lower limb deformity (p = 0.011) which, in turn, was related to fasting serum phosphate concentration (r = -0.56, p less than 0.025) and TmP/GFR (r = -0.70, p less than 0.005). Enthesopathy affected 33% of those younger than 30 years, and all those above this age. Nineteen individuals had experienced significant dental problems, most commonly abscess formation. Eight had required complete dental clearance. Twelve women from the group had a total of 22 live births. Fifteen of these were by cesarean section, although radiologic evidence of pelvic narrowing was not found in any subject. Serum ALP was elevated in all but 3 of the 18 untreated subjects. Levels correlated with those of other indices of bone turnover (BGP r = 0.82, p less than 0.005; urine total HP r = 0.60, p less than 0.025; urine free HPr = 0.78, p less than 0.005), but were not related to the degree of osteomalacia found on bone biopsy. Serum levels of iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and thyroid hormones were generally normal in the untreated patients. We conclude that adults with untreated XLH have osteomalacia that is frequently symptomatic. Even greater morbidity is caused by degenerative joint disease arising from lower limb deformities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Five hundred consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were entered into a prospective study of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) in their 3 major immunoglobulin isotypes and followed thereafter with repeated testing for a mean period of nearly 8 months. Manifestations of SLE that were strongly associated with ACLA included venous thrombosis (particularly when recurrent), thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, recurrent fetal loss, and leg ulcers. Other manifestations found to be associated with ACLA were arterial occlusions, transverse myelitis, and pulmonary hypertension. Conversely, we found no relationship between ACLA and migraine, convulsions, transient ischemic attacks, psychoses, or avascular necrosis of bone. No relationship was found between the presence of ACLA and that of anti-DNA antibodies studied in the same serum sample. Association with ACLA grew stronger and titers became higher in patients with several of the associated manifestations. Statistical analyses revealed the existence of a syndrome, the antiphospholipid syndrome, comprising 2 or more manifestations in conjunction with ACLA titers 5 standard deviations above the mean of normal control subjects, particularly if ACLA had been positive on at least 2 occasions. We propose that such criteria could be applied to the definition of the antiphospholipid syndrome. The presence and the titers of these antibodies related to disease activity and titer decreased by treatment, particularly when they were of the IgM isotype. Patients in whom a thrombotic episode occurred during the course of the study were observed to have a coincident decrease in ACLA titers, a finding that might indicate consumption of the antibody during the event. Treatment and the resulting inactivation of disease appear to have independent effects on ACLA titers. Physicians should therefore be cautious in prescribing high doses of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to patients with SLE solely because they have high titers of ACLA.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease on Graves' ophthalmopathy and the possible protective role of corticosteroids. Between June 1985 and June 1988, 26 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with radioiodine alone (group 1) and 26 to treatment with this agent and concomitant administration of systemic prednisone for four months (group 2). The initial dose of prednisone was 0.4 to 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight for one month; the drug was gradually withdrawn over the next three months. All patients were evaluated at 3-month intervals for 18 months after they underwent radioiodine therapy. Ocular changes were assessed with the ophthalmopathy index; patients with moderate-to-severe changes (scores greater than or equal to 4) were excluded from the study. Before treatment, 10 patients in group 1 and 5 in group 2 had no evidence of ophthalmopathy: in none of them did ocular symptoms appear after radioiodine therapy. Among the patients in group 1 with an initial ophthalmopathy index greater than or equal to 1, ocular disease worsened in 56 percent (mostly involving soft-tissue changes and extraocular-muscle function) and did not change in 44 percent. In contrast, ophthalmopathy improved in 52 percent and did not change in 48 percent of group 2. The mean ophthalmopathy index increased from 1.5 to 3.0 in group 1 (P less than 0.005) and decreased from 2.2 to 1.3 in group 2 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that systemic corticosteroid treatment prevents the exacerbations of Graves' ophthalmopathy that occur after radioiodine therapy in a substantial proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism who have some degree of ocular involvement before treatment.\r"

  ".W": "To identify the chromosomal location of a gene responsible for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we used clinical and molecular genetic techniques to evaluate the members of a large kindred. Twenty surviving and 24 deceased family members had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; 58 surviving members were unaffected. Genetic-linkage analyses were performed with polymorphic DNA loci dispersed throughout the entire genome, to identify a locus that was inherited with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in family members. The significance of the linkage detected between the disease locus and polymorphic loci was assessed by calculating a lod score (the logarithm of the probability of observing coinheritance of two loci, assuming that they are genetically linked, divided by the probability of detecting coinheritance if they are unlinked). A DNA locus (D14S26), previously mapped to chromosome 14 and of unknown function, was found to be coinherited with the disease in this family. No instances of recombination were observed between the locus for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and D14S26, yielding a lod score of +9.37 (theta = 0). These data indicate that in this kindred, the odds are greater than 2,000,000,000:1 that the gene responsible for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is located on chromosome 14 (band q1).\r"

  ".W": "Postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia is a controversial disorder because its symptoms are not specific, the presence of symptoms often correlates weakly with blood glucose concentrations measured after oral glucose administration, and glucose levels have rarely been measured when symptoms have developed spontaneously. In this study, we measured blood glucose in 28 patients with suspected postprandial hypoglycemia while they were experiencing their typical symptoms, in capillary blood collected on filter paper. Five patients (18 percent) had symptoms of \"hypoglycemia\" that were associated with blood glucose levels of 2.8 mmol per liter (50 mg per deciliter) or less, and eight other patients (29 percent) had symptoms associated with glucose levels of 2.9 to 3.3 mmol per liter on at least one occasion. Six (5 percent) of 132 reported symptomatic episodes that were associated with blood glucose levels of 2.8 mmol per liter or less, and 16 (12 percent) with levels of 2.9 to 3.3 mmol per liter. In 140 measurements made in 17 normal subjects, blood glucose levels were never found to be less than 2.8 mmol per liter, and levels of 2.9 to 3.3 mmol per liter were found only twice. No specific symptom was associated with low glucose levels in the patients with suspected hypoglycemia. The relief of symptoms by ingesting food was more often associated with low than with normal blood glucose levels: 86 percent of episodes in which blood glucose values were less than or equal to 3.3 mmol per liter were relieved by eating, as compared with 53 percent of episodes in which values were more than 3.3 mmol per liter (P less than 0.007). No correlation was found between plasma glucose levels measured after oral glucose administration and blood glucose levels measured during symptoms. We conclude that postprandial hypoglycemia is infrequent, even in a referral population, and that recording blood glucose measurements during spontaneously occurring symptomatic episodes is necessary to establish the diagnosis since symptoms are not specific and oral glucose-tolerance testing is not helpful.\r"

We studied the effects of coffee prepared by two common brewing methods (filtering and boiling) on serum lipid levels in a 12-week randomized trial involving 107 young adult subjects with normal serum cholesterol levels. After a three-week run-in period during which they all consumed filtered coffee, the participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups receiving four to six cups of boiled coffee a day, four to six cups of filtered coffee a day, or no coffee, for a period of nine weeks. As compared with the change from base line in the filtered-coffee group, the serum total cholesterol level increased after the consumption of boiled coffee by 0.48 mmol per liter (95 percent confidence limits, 0.13 and 0.83), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased by 0.39 mmol per liter (95 percent confidence limits, -0.04 and 0.82). There was no significant difference in the change in serum total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between the filtered-coffee group and the group that drank no coffee. The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoproteins were not affected by boiled or filtered coffee. We conclude that drinking filtered coffee does not affect serum lipid levels. The consumption of boiled coffee, however, has an effect on serum cholesterol levels amounting to a mean net increase of 10 percent of the base-line level after nine weeks.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, lower serum levels have been recommended for maintenance therapy with lithium. We studied 94 patients with bipolar disorder in a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial of two different doses of lithium for maintenance therapy: the \"standard\" dose, adjusted to achieve a serum lithium concentration of 0.8 to 1.0 mmol per liter, and a \"low\" dose, resulting in a serum concentration of 0.4 to 0.6 mmol per liter. The group medians of the patients' average serum lithium levels were 0.83 mmol per liter for the patients in the standard-range group and 0.54 mmol per liter for those in the low-range group. Six of 47 patients (13 percent) assigned to receive lithium doses that would produce serum levels in the standard range had relapses while on protocol, as compared with 18 of 47 (38 percent) assigned to the low-dose range. The risk of relapse was 2.6 times higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.2) among patients in the low-range group than among those in the standard-range group. Side effects, including tremor, diarrhea, urinary frequency, weight gain, and a metallic taste in the mouth, were more frequent in the standard-range group. We conclude that doses resulting in serum lithium levels from 0.8 to 1.0 mmol per liter are more effective in treating bipolar disorder than those that result in lower serum lithium concentrations, although the higher doses are associated with a higher incidence of side effects. Recent findings about the limited nephrotoxicity of lithium, along with our observations, suggest that physicians should attempt to maintain serum lithium levels between 0.8 and 1.0 mmol per liter in most patients with bipolar disorder and that they should attempt to enhance patients' understanding of and compliance with this regimen.\r"

A questionnaire was mailed to all women 50 years of age and under who held full-time appointments in departments of medicine (n = 862), as listed in the faculty roster of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The survey included questions about childbearing and child rearing, attitudes about personal and professional issues, and role models. Of the 694 questionnaires that were delivered, over 80 percent were completed (n = 558). The mean age of the respondents was 38.1 years, and 63 percent had children. The 350 mothers had a mean of 1.9 children; only 3 had 4 or more children. Approximately half the respondents with children had their first child after completing medical training (mean age, 30.6 years), and they were absent from work for a median of 6 weeks post partum; 72 percent took no time off before labor and delivery, and 83 percent were back at work within 12 weeks. The majority were satisfied with their decision to have children and with their careers, despite the fact that 78 percent believed that their career progress had been slowed or markedly slowed by their having had children. We conclude that it is possible for women to combine motherhood with a fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult, and most such women believe that motherhood slows the progress of their careers.\r"

An important substrate of PKC in the brain is the neuron-specific presynaptically localized protein B-50 (also termed GAP-43, F1, pp46 or P-57). B-50 has been implicated in the regulation of polyphosphoinositide metabolism and calmodulin binding, and in the mechanisms of neurite outgrowth, long-term potentiation and transmitter release. It is still unknown, however, whether B-50 (and/or its phosphorylation) is essential to any of these processes. Here we report the results of studies in which antibodies to B-50, which interfere with B-50 phosphorylation, were introduced into rat cortical synaptosomes that were permeabilized with streptolysin-O (SL-O). We found that the release of [3H]noradrenaline, induced by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the buffer, is inhibited completely by the antibodies. These results provide the first demonstration of a causal relationship between the PKC substrate B-50 and the release of neurotransmitter.\r"

  ".W": "Activated T lymphocytes proliferate in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), which binds to a specific high-affinity receptor (IL-2R). This consists of at least two noncovalently linked polypeptides, p55/IL-2R alpha (Tac) and p75/IL-2R beta. Both molecules bind IL-2 independently, with low and intermediate affinity respectively, but only IL-2R beta is thought to mediate IL-2 signal transduction. Although IL-2R beta seems to be constitutively expressed on resting T lymphocytes, the growth of these T cells is specifically induced by antigenic triggering by the T-cell receptor (TCR), which then results in the transcription of both IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes. By contrast, activation of the IL-2/IL-2R pathway in the thymus seems to precede the appearance of the TCR, as IL-2R alpha is expressed on T-cell precursors lacking TCR. The basis for IL-2R expression by immature thymocytes, however, remains largely unknown. We show here that IL-2R alpha-negative T-cell precursors constitutively express IL-2R beta and produce their own IL-2. The IL-2/IL-2R beta interaction on these cells induces the expression of IL-2R alpha, leading to high-affinity IL-2R display and cellular proliferation. We suggest that this IL-2-dependent autocrine pathway of growth stimulation plays a key role in the intrathymic development of mature T cells.\r"

Treatment of mouse T lymphocytes with antibodies specific for two such proteins, Thy-1 and Ly-6, are known to induce proliferation. We have found that antibodies specific for Qa-2, a GPI-anchored class I histocompatibility antigen, can also activate mouse T cells. To determine whether the GPI-anchor is important for this pathway of cell activation, we produced transgenic mice expressing either normal GPI-anchored Qa-2, or Qa-2 molecules with a membrane-spanning protein domain derived from H-2. Our studies show that only lymphocytes from transgenic mice carrying GPI-anchored forms of Qa-2 can be activated in vitro by Qa-2-specific antibodies. We also show that transgenic mouse T cells expressing a GPI-anchored form of H-2Db can be activated by anti-H-2Db antibodies. These results strongly indicate that the GPI-anchor is critical for this pathway of T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid removal of Ca2+ ions from the cytosol, necessary for the efficient relaxation of cardiac muscle cells, is performed by the Ca2+-pumping ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium pump is activated by cyclic AMP- and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban, an integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Using a heterobifunctional crosslinking agent which can be cleaved and photoactivated, we provide evidence for a direct interaction between the two proteins. Only the non-phosphorylated form of phospholamban interacts with the ATPase, demonstrating that phospholamban is an endogenous inhibitor that is removed from the ATPase by phosphorylation. Non-phosphorylated phospholamban interacts only with the calcium-free conformation of the ATPase and is released when it is converted to the calcium-bound state. We localized the site of interaction to a single peptide isolated after cyanogen bromide cleavage of the ATPase. The peptide derives from a domain just C-terminal to the aspartyl phosphate of the active site. This domain is unique to ATPases of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in that it has no homology with any other phosphorylation-type ion pump. The domain occurs in both slow- and fast-twitch isoforms of the ATPase, even though phospholamban is not expressed in fast-twitch muscles.\r"

It has been proposed that the entorhinal cortex (EC), particularly the stellate cells of layer II (ECIIscs), plays an important part in the genesis of the theta rhythm. These neurons occupy a key position in the neocortex-hippocampus-neocortex circuit, a crucial crossroad in memory functions. Neuronal oscillations typically rely on the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductances and the Ca2+ -dependent K+ conductance that usually follows, as seen in other limbic subcortical structures generating theta rhythmicity. Here we report, however, that similar oscillations are generated in ECIIscs by a Na+ conductance. The finding of a subthreshold, voltage-gated, Na+ -dependent rhythmic membrane oscillation in mammalian neurons indicates that rhythmicity in heterogeneous neuronal networks may be supported by different sets of intrinsic ionic mechanisms in each of the neuronal elements involved.\r"

The presentation of antigen to these two classes of T lymphocytes can occur through distinct pathways. Several mechanisms, including differences in antigen processing in different intracellular compartments, have been proposed to account for these pathway differences. Here we describe a T-cell epitope located on the influenza virus haemaglutinin, which is recognized by both class I and class II MHC-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). When expressed de novo in target cells, from a synthetic minigene encoding only the epitope, this pre-processed antigenic site is recognized by class I but not class II MHC-restricted T lymphocytes, even though target cells treated with the exogenously introduced peptide can be recognized by both classes of T cells. Because endogenous expression of the pre-processed antigenic fragment results in differential presentation to class I and class II MHC-restricted CTL, differences between the two different pathways of presentation could lie not at the level of processing but at the level of targeting and/or interaction of processed antigen with MHC.\r"

  ".W": "A feature common to many animal models of autoimmune disease, for example, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis and collagen-induced arthritis, is the presence of self-reactive T cells in healthy animals, which are activated to produce disease by immunization with exogenous antigen. It is unclear why these T cells are not deleted during ontogeny in the thymus and, having escaped tolerance induction, why they are not spontaneously activated by self-antigen. To investigate these questions, we have examined an experimental model in which mice are tolerant to an antigen despite the presence of antigen-reactive T cells. We find that the T cells that escape tolerance induction are specific for minor determinants on the antigen. We propose that these T cells evade tolerance induction because some minor determinants are only available in relatively low amounts after in vivo processing of the whole antigen. For the same reason, these T cells are not normally activated but can be stimulated under special circumstances to circumvent tolerance.\r"

The expression of p8 and p14 seems to be confined to a specific stage of myeloid cell differentiation, because both proteins are expressed in circulating neutrophils and monocytes but not in normal tissue macrophages. In chronic inflammatory conditions, however, such as rheumatoid arthritis, macrophages in affected tissues express both p8 and p14. These proteins are members of a family of CaBPs of low Mr, which include S-100 alpha and beta proteins, calcyclin (2A9), intestinal CaBP and p11. All the proteins have an Mr of approximately 10,000 with the exception of p14 which has a longer C-terminal sequence after the second calcium-binding domain. Little is known about their function, although by analogy with calmodulin they could be molecules involved in intracellular signalling that are activated by an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]). Here we report that p14 is phosphorylated in both monocytes and neutrophils. The level of p14 phosphorylation can be increased by elevating the [Ca2+]i using the ionophore ionomycin, but is not affected by activation of protein kinase C using phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. The phosphorylated residue is threonine at position 113, which is the penultimate amino acid in p14 and contained in the longer 'tail' sequence. Part of this sequence is identical to the neutrophil immobilizing factors NIF-1 and NIF-2, indicating that the phosphorylation event could have a role in the generation of NIF activity in the p14 protein.\r"

Also, images of unshadowed complexes of DNA with the RecA protein from Escherichia coli indicate that this technique may not be restricted to thin biological samples. Here we present images of polydeoxyadenylate molecules aligned in parallel, with their bases lying flat on a surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and with their charged phosphodiester backbones protruding upwards. Based on these images, a molecular model has been built which suggests the presence of a hydrogen bond that could stabilize the parallel alignment. Our micrographs demonstrate the potential application of scanning tunnelling microscopy in structural studies of nucleic acids and provide evidence that it could be used to sequence DNA.\r"

If the forces exerted on the limb skeleton during brachiation indeed differ greatly from those of other locomotor modes, then the changes in skeletal loading accompanying a shift in locomotor behaviour could favour alterations in skeletal morphology in brachiating lineages. In vivo skeletal strain patterns recorded by using radiotelemetry during brachiation indicate that the forelimb bones of the gibbon are loaded in substantial tension and show reduced bending and compression in comparison with those of other mammals. We suggest that this unique loading regime could have contributed to the evolution of the distinctive morphology of hylobatid limbs.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence exists that the specification of afferent nerves and their central connections in the embryo may depend in part on influences from the peripheral target innervated. We have now investigated whether such peripheral determination persists in the adult rat using the unmyelinated afferent system of C fibres, which differ chemically in the adult depending on their target. We have previously shown that if the cutaneous sural nerve and the muscle gastrocnemius nerve are cross-anastomosed so that they grow to each other's target, the A fibres establish functional endings and the C fibres change their chemistry to that which is appropriate for the new target. Here we report that in normal adult rats, a short train of stimuli to the cutaneous sural nerve produced a brief facilitation of the flexion reflex, lasting on average only 5 min, whereas similar stimulation of the gastrocnemius-muscle nerve enhanced this reflex for an average of 54 min. In cross-anastomosed animals, stimulation of the gastrocnemius nerve (innervating skin) induced a brief potentiation of the flexion reflex, lasting on average only 3 min. By contrast, stimulation of sural nerve (innervating muscle) produced a potentiation of this reflex lasting 57 min. Thus the ability of adult afferent nerves to potentiate the flexion reflex depends on the target with which they make contact. We propose that tissue-specific factors influence some of the central actions of primary afferent neurons in the adult.\r"

  ".U": "90044099\r", 
  ".W": "Neurotransmitter can modulate neuronal activity through a variety of second messengers that act on ion channels and other substrate proteins. The most commonly described effector mechanism for second messengers in neurons depends on protein phosphorylation mediated by one of three sets of kinases: the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, and the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinases. In addition, some neurotransmitters and second messengers can also inhibit protein phosphorylation by lowering cAMP levels (either by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase or activating phosphodiesterases). This raises the question: can neurotransmitters also modulate neuronal activity by decreasing protein phosphorylation that is independent of cAMP? Various biochemical experiments show that a decrease in protein phosphorylation can arise through activation of a phosphatase or inhibition of kinases. In none of these cases, however, is the physiological role for the decrease in protein phosphorylation known. Here we report that in Aplysia sensory neurons, the presynaptic inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide decreases the resting levels of protein phosphorylation without altering the level of cAMP. Furthermore, FMRFamide overrides the cAMP-mediated enhancement of transmitter release produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and concomitantly reverses the cAMP-dependent increase in protein phosphorylation produced by 5-HT. These findings indicate that a receptor-mediated decrease in protein phosphorylation may play an important part in the modulation of neurotransmitter release.\r"

  ".W": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common form of dysmorphic genetic obesity associated with mental retardation. About 60% of cases have a cytological deletion of chromosome 15q11q13 (refs 2, 3). These deletions occur de novo exclusively on the paternal chromosome. By contrast, Angelman syndrome (AS) is a very different clinical disorder and is also associated with deletions of region 15q11q13 (refs 6-8), indistinguishable from those in PWS except that they occur de novo on the maternal chromosome. The parental origin of the affected chromosomes 15 in these disorders could, therefore, be a contributory factor in determining their clinical phenotypes. We have now used cloned DNA markers specific for the 15q11q13 subregion to determine the parental origin of chromosome 15 in PWS individuals not having cytogenetic deletions; these individuals account for almost all of the remaining 40% of PWS cases. Probands in two families displayed maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15q11q13. This is the first demonstration that maternal heterodisomy--the presence of two different chromosome 15s derived from the mother--can be associated with a human genetic disease. The absence of a paternal contribution of genes in region 15q11q13, as found in PWS deletion cases, rather than a mutation in a specific gene(s) in this region may result in expression of the clinical phenotype. Thus, we conclude that a gene or genes in region 15q11q13 must be inherited from each parent for normal human development.\r"

  ".W": "Disulphide bonds can significantly stabilize the native structures of proteins. The effect is presumed to be due mainly to a decrease in the configurational chain entropy of the unfolded polypeptide. In phage T4 lysozyme, a disulphide-free enzyme, engineered disulphide mutants that crosslink residues 3-97, 9-164 and 21-142 are significantly more stable than the wild-type protein. To investigate the effect of multiple-disulphide bonds on protein stability, mutants were constructed in which two or three stabilizing disulphide bridges were combined in the same protein. Reversible thermal denaturation shows that the increase in melting temperature resulting from the individual disulphide bonds is approximately additive. The triple-disulphide variant unfolds at a temperature 23.4 degrees C higher than wild-type lysozyme. The results demonstrate that a combination of disulphide bonds, each of which contributes to stability, can achieve substantial overall improvement in the stability of a protein.\r"

We have tested this hypothesis by constructing a series of mutations in the two N-caps of barnase (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease, positions Thr 6 and Thr 26) and determining the change in their stability. The N-cap is found to stabilize the protein by up to approximately 2.5 kcal mol(-1). The presence of a negative charge of the N-cap adds some 1.6 kcal mol(-1) of stabilization energy because of the interaction with the macroscopic electrostatic dipole of the helix.\r"

When both groups were matched for duration of the disease, the early-onset group still showed a significantly higher frequency of depression, whereas tremor, akinesia, and rigidity were significantly more severe in the late-onset group. A stepwise regression analysis showed that in the early-onset group, depression scores were significantly correlated with scores of cognitive impairment and duration of the disease, while in the late-onset group, depression scores were significantly correlated with impairments in activities of daily living.

Eye movement abnormalities are characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction. Dementia progresses gradually over several years. Later, rigidity and bradykinesia appear and, at this stage, there is often psychosis or severe depression with rapid weight loss. Death occurs in 6 months to 2 years after onset of rigidity. Magnetic resonance imaging in 2 affected individuals showed cerebellar atrophy. There is decreased T2 signal in the basal ganglia, consistent with iron deposition.\r"

They determined the absolute temperatures of the tip of digit 1 (D1), D2, D3, D4, D5, and of the thenar and hypothenar eminences. We calculated the temperature differences (absolute values throughout) between any 2 of these 7 sites, and computed the median index (MI = [D1 - D2] + [D1 - D3] + [D2 - D3]). Comparison of the control and CTS groups revealed greater temperature differences in CTS between D1 - D3, D1 - D4, D3 - D5, D4 - D5, and MI. There was a marked overlap between the 2 groups. Comparison of individual CTS hands with controls revealed definite thermographic abnormalities in 0 of 9 hands with mild NCS abnormalities, and in 7 of 14 hands with marked NCS abnormalities. These findings indicate that the sensitivity of LCT in CTS is low compared with NCS, and previous favorable reports concerning thermography in CTS may have been due to lack of control series or absence of quantitation.\r"

We graded the MRIs for severity of WMH using a scale tested on an elderly patient population. We found that 22% of normal subjects had moderate lesions and 9% had severe lesions. All subjects had normal neurologic examination findings and were within normal limits on a battery of neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological performance decreased and the severity of WMH increased with age. However, when the data were corrected for age, there was no correlation between neuropsychological function and the presence of WMH. We conclude that white matter changes in the elderly by themselves are of doubtful clinical significance.\r"

The profile of progression of this memory deficit is assumed to represent a unitary decline. We studied the profile of verbal memory decline using an immediate free recall learning task in 18 DAT patients judged to be at 3 different stages of severity (mildly, moderately, and severely affected), using the serial-position function as the dependent measure. Results showed that the pattern of performance of DAT patients depended upon the severity of the disease. With mild dementia, the U-shaped curve was qualitatively similar to that observed in normals (presence of primacy and recency effects). With increasing severity of dementia, there was a consistent modification of the serial-position function with, in moderately affected subjects, a progression toward a unimodal curve devoid of a primacy effect and, later on, a decrease of the recency effect. These findings suggest that the serial-position function shows dynamic changes across stages of DAT. These dynamic changes may imply distinct disturbances of 2 or more learning-memory processes in this condition. The processes involved presumably reflect the temporal nature of the pathologic involvement of distinct neural systems, both structural and neurochemical.\r"

In the patient seen during the acute phase there was denervation in paraspinal and abdominal muscles on EMG examination. In both patients, the protrusion subsided without specific treatment in 2 to 4 months. This seldom-described manifestation of diabetic truncal neuropathy masquerading as abdominal hernia needs a higher profile to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigation.

The mean RV was greater in controls than in diabetics or other neuropathies, but there were marked overlaps among groups. We conclude that the VAR, while impaired in the neuropathies, is of little value as a clinical test and is a poorer test of autonomic function than the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test or heart rate responses to deep breathing or the Valsalva maneuver.\r"

We simultaneously compared bilaterally placed depth and limited subdural electrode EEG to determine the most effective method of recording seizures from the temporal lobes. Localized complex partial seizures usually appeared earlier in hippocampal depth electrodes and spread later to subdural recording sites. In 3 patients, hippocampal recordings showed localized seizure origin but subdural recording was nonlocalizing due to rapid bilateral seizure propagation. In 1 patient with nonlocalized seizures presumably of extratemporal origin, subdural electrodes incorrectly lateralized seizure origin to a temporal lobe. Auras and subclinical seizures detected by depth electrode recording were often not evident with subdural electrodes. We conclude that EEG recording with hippocampal depth electrodes correctly identifies and lateralizes temporal lobe seizures more often than with limited subdural electrodes.\r"

Even fewer such reports have been accompanied by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing. We report 3 patients who fulfill criteria for symptomatic narcolepsy, 1 with a craniopharyngioma, the 2nd with a hypothalamic syndrome of unknown etiology, and the 3rd with obstructive hydrocephalus and a sarcoid granuloma in the region of the 3rd ventricle. The first 2 were positive for HLA-DR2 while the 3rd was negative for the HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQwl antigens. These findings suggest that diencephalic lesions can be associated with signs and symptoms of narcolepsy that are clinically indistinguishable from those of idiopathic narcolepsy, and that the HLA-DR2 antigen is not required in all cases of symptomatic narcolepsy.\r"

The thalamus was the most frequent site of hemorrhage (6/8). The neurologic status deteriorated in all: 6 within 24 hours, and 2 after 5 and 7 days. Persistent hypertension was common (6/8) prior to extension of the hemorrhage. The 2nd CT revealed an obvious increase in hematoma size in all cases. Four patients died and 4 survived with severe neurologic disability. These serial studies indicate that active bleeding or rebleeding can occur in HICH and suggests that the risk is particularly high with thalamic hemorrhage. We conclude that meticulous control of hypertension after HICH may be justified in selected patients.\r"

Signal intensity in the lateral substantia nigra did not differ significantly among patients with PD, PS, or controls and was therefore not a useful MRI marker.

The overall rate was 18.4 cases per 10,000 births, with a threefold increase found from 1986 to 1988. A case-control study using matched pairs was done to identify differences in maternal demographics and pregnancy outcome. Congenital syphilis case mothers were predominantly black American women who lacked prenatal care (67%) and who were substance abusers (71%) significantly more often than their matched controls (P less than .005). Three cases of seroconversion in pregnancy were identified. Failure to screen or inappropriate treatment occurred in four patients. Seven women were treated during pregnancy: Five received benzathine penicillin G for 3 consecutive weeks and two received erythromycin. All treated patients presented for initial care in the late second or third trimester. Thirty-seven infants (66%) were live-born and 19 (34%) were stillborn. Preterm labor and premature rupture of the membranes were significantly more common in infected pregnancies than in controls (P less than .005). Live-born case infants had significantly lower birth weights than controls (P less than .005), with 21% of case infants growth-retarded. Seven neonatal deaths and one infant death occurred. The resultant perinatal mortality rate from congenital syphilis in this series was 464 pe 1000.\r"

Of the 33 formal claims, 14 (42%) were dismissed, either by the plaintiff's attorney or by the courts. Eighteen of the remaining 19 claims were settled before trial, with an average payment to the plaintiff of $185,000. The one suit that went to trial resulted in a defense verdict. A review of the case histories demonstrated that in the majority of cases when a payment was made, probable medical negligence had taken place. Non-meritorious claims were not compensated. For those cases in which a payment was made, the size of the settlement was commensurate with the seriousness of the injury, which almost always involved damage to the infant. Poor physician judgment was the most common source of error.\r"

Interpretable cardiotocogram patterns and cord arterial pH and blood gas analysis were obtained in 698 cases. The sensitivity of an abnormal cardiotocogram at any time for acidosis (more than 1 SD below the mean, pH less than 7.17) was 80%, and for severe acidosis (more than 2 SDs below the mean, pH less than 7.085) was 83%. However, the predictive value was low, and 32% of fetuses had an abnormal cardiotocogram but no acidosis. If only cardiotocogram abnormality in the first stage of labor was considered, sensitivity was still 47% for acidosis and 67% for severe acidosis, and the false-positive rate was reduced to only 14%. We attempted to improve the prediction of acidosis by including meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, but 65% of the variation in umbilical cord artery pH and 72 and 86% of the variation in 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, respectively, remained unexplained. In light of these poor correlations, the current practice of considering cardiotocogram abnormality, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, acidosis, and low Apgar scores as indicating one single disorder, \"fetal distress,\" is not valid.\r"

These fetuses were studied because of suspected fetal diseases and were subsequently proved to be normal by the fetal blood examinations. Umbilical vein pH and pO2 decreased whereas pCO2 and bicarbonate increased with gestational age. The umbilical vein base excess did not correlate with gestational duration, but oxygen saturation tended to decrease with gestational age. Twenty hydropic fetuses with Bart hemoglobinopathy were also studied; they were found to be more acidotic, hypoxic, and hypercarbic than normal fetuses.\r"

Numerous infectious organisms that change the normal vaginal milieu have been associated with preterm PROM. Because these organisms alter vaginal pH, the use of pH was evaluated as a potential marker for women at increased risk for preterm PROM. Among 115 women at high risk for an LBW birth, those with a mean vaginal pH above 4.5 had a threefold increased risk of preterm PROM as compared with those with a mean pH of 4.5 or lower. Vaginal pH may be a useful marker to predict a woman's risk for preterm PROM.\r"

Chorionic villus sampling material was processed for direct analysis and backed up when indicated (now routinely) with tissue cultures. The incidence of inconclusive results requiring additional studies was 1.2% for chorionic villus sampling and 0.75% for amniotic fluid cells. Mosaicism was the most common problem for both chorionic villus sampling and amniotic fluid cells. Failure of growth was more frequent in amniocentesis material (0.35 versus 0.09%), but polyploidy and atypical aneuploidies were greater with chorionic villus sampling. The accuracy of cytogenetic evaluation by chorionic villus sampling and amniotic fluid cells and the need for additional invasive procedures appear to be equal in our laboratory.\r"

Six patients were delivered at term of appropriately grown infants without complication. One patient experienced an intrauterine death at 25 weeks' gestation (6 weeks after the occurrence of fluid leakage secondary to genetic amniocentesis). Although limited by the small number of patients, our experience suggests the following: 1) Appropriate respect for potential complications of genetic amniocentesis is still warranted; 2) expectant management of patients who experience membrane rupture after genetic amniocentesis may be associated with a good perinatal outcome; and 3) membrane rupture after genetic amniocentesis may represent a fundamentally different etiologic entity than spontaneous rupture of the membranes in the second trimester not associated with genetic amniocentesis.\r"

  ".W": "Although fetal urine output and swallowing are major contributors to amniotic fluid regulation, other pathways for fluid movement must be involved in the regulation of amniotic fluid volume because many studies report fetal urine output to be greater than swallowing. This study was designed to examine the possibility of fluid transfer between the amniotic cavity and the fetal blood that perfuses the fetal membranes and surface of the placenta in the ovine fetus. We injected warmed distilled water into the amniotic fluid in three groups of chronically catheterized fetal sheep. In normal fetuses, there was rapid absorption of the water into the fetal circulation, resulting in highly significant decreases in fetal osmolality, plasma electrolytes, and heart rate as well as increases in arterial pressure and fetal hemolysis. Concomitantly, there was a small, delayed fall in maternal osmolality. In a second group of fetuses with ligated esophagi, these same responses occurred except that the fetal osmolality and electrolyte changes occurred earlier and were significantly greater. In a third group of fetuses killed just before the water injection, maternal osmolality was unchanged. These data suggest the intramembranous pathway as a major route of amniotic fluid absorption in the ovine fetus. In addition, esophageal ligation appears to augment the conductance of this pathway, as evidenced by a significantly greater estimated filtration coefficient and rate of water absorption in the ligated animals than in controls. Finally, the transmembranous pathway directly to the mother does not appear to be a major route.\r"

To determine whether the transport function of the yolk sac was impaired simultaneously as a result of these hyperglycemic conditions, horseradish peroxidase was used as a tracer protein to assess the transport function of the visceral endodermal yolk sac cells of conceptuses cultured in both control and hyperglycemic media. Cellular uptake of peroxidase, which was added to the culture medium for 3 or 24 hours, was observed in controls. This differed from the marked diminution in peroxidase uptake seen in conceptuses cultured in hyperglycemic medium. These results demonstrate that during hyperglycemia-induced embryopathy, there is concomitant yolk sac failure evidenced by morphologic alterations and impaired endocytosis. These findings therefore strengthen our hypothesis that diabetes-related malformations, as demonstrated experimentally in rat conceptuses, are associated with impairment in the structure and functions of the visceral yolk sac cells during a critical period of organogenesis.\r"

The mean thickness of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 329 histologic sections from 62 cases was 0.38 mm; 99.5% of all vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia measured less than 0.77 and 0.69 mm in the hairy and non-hairy skin, respectively.

Twenty-eight women (4.9%) had peritoneal cytology positive for malignant cells. Comparisons were made between the groups with positive and negative cytology. Subgroups used in analysis included stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, treatment regimen, histology, grade, depth of myometrial invasion, and cervical Papanicolaou smear results. Cervical smear status was the only subgroup in which a statistically significant difference was found, with the positive peritoneal cytology patients having a higher incidence of positive Papanicolaou smears (P = .01). Forty-nine women (8.6%) developed recurrent tumor, 7% of the negative-cytology group and 32% of the positive-cytology group (P = .0002). The progression-free survival rate was lowered significantly by positive peritoneal cytology (P less than .0001); patients with negative peritoneal cytology had a significantly better 5-year survival rate, 96 versus 84% (P = .0001). When multivariate analysis was performed on the 477 cases that had no missing values, peritoneal cytology remained significant for both survival rate (P = .01) and progression-free interval (P = .002). Positive peritoneal cytology is a poor prognostic factor for patients with surgical stage I endometrial cancer.\r"

Among 69 stage Ib tumors, no significant differences were found in the size of tumor, presence of parametrial involvement, or lymph node metastasis among patients whose tumor contained HPV 16, HPV 18, or no HPV DNA; however, 45% of the women with HPV 18-containing tumors (five of 11) had recurrence, as compared with only 16% of those with HPV 16 (five of 31) during the 20-month mean follow-up period. This tendency for HPV 18-containing tumors to recur was seen with all histologic subtypes of cervical cancers and with all grades of tumor. In addition, patients with HPV 18-containing tumors were more likely to give a history of recent normal Papanicolaou smears than were those whose tumors contained HPV 16. Forty-four percent of women with HPV 18 in their tumors had a history of three class I Papanicolaou smears in the 3 years before the diagnosis of cancer, whereas a similar history was elicited in only 16% of those with HPV 16 in their tumors, suggesting that HPV 18-containing tumors might progress to invasion without a prolonged preinvasive period.\r"

One week later, a laparotomy was performed for evaluation (prescore scale: 0 = no adhesions to 4+ = severe) and subsequent lysis of adhesions. Before operative closure, animals were allocated randomly to intraperitoneal treatment with either verapamil 2.5 micrograms/kg/hour or vehicle, delivered by mini-osmotic infusion pumps over the course of 200 hours. Seven days later, the animals were sacrificed and evaluated blindly for extent of adhesion reformation (postscore). Prescores for verapamil and control rabbits were not significantly different (3.3 versus 2.9). Verapamil-treated animals formed considerably fewer adhesions than did controls after adhesiolysis (postscore 0.5 versus 3.5; P less than .001).

  ".W": "The short gracilis myocutaneous flap derives its blood supply from terminal branches of the obturator artery, and the vascular pedicle derived from the medial femoral circumflex artery is sacrificed. Twenty-one short gracilis myocutaneous flaps were used for vulvovaginal reconstructions in 11 patients undergoing radical pelvic surgery: bilateral flaps in nine patients for neovaginal construction after pelvic exenterations, bilateral flaps in one patient for vulvovaginal reconstruction after radical vulvovaginectomy, and a unilateral flap in one patient for vulvovaginal reconstruction after radical vulvectomy with partial vaginectomy. Major complications consisted of bilateral flap necrosis occurring in one patient who had received preoperative irradiation to the vulva and groin combined with chemotherapy. Minor degrees of necrosis (less than 5%) and/or separation of vaginal suture lines occurred in five patients without marked loss of the flaps. Vaginal caliber and depth are excellent in ten patients (91%) after follow-up of 1-22 months. The short gracilis flap is an excellent alternative to the more bulky gracilis flap, which derives its blood supply from perforating branches of the femoral artery. Based on our experience, the short gracilis flap provides adequately vascularized tissue for vulvovaginal reconstruction in patients after radical pelvic surgery, but should not be used in patients who have received extensive groin irradiation.\r"

Prominence of one or both loops was seen in 35 eyes (78%) of group A, with peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) in 25 (55%). Prominence of one loop was seen in 14 eyes (31%) of group B, with PAS in 8 (18%) (P less than 0.001). Final visual acuity was comparable in both groups, 98% achieving 6/12 (20/40) or better. Although not statistically significant, the incidence of pigment dispersion, uveitis, discomfort and visual aberrations was greater in group A than in group B. We suggest that the apparent superiority of the Nova Curve Kratz lens in terms of the smaller incidence of loop prominence, as well as the reduced incidence of these other complications, is due to the fact that its haptic is inserted into the optic's edge rather than into the anterior surface of the lens optic, as is the case with the Lasagap lens.\r"

Five months after surgery one of the tacks was detected in the anterior chamber. Two tacks remained in situ and induced a localized glial reaction, breaks in Bruch's membrane, disappearance of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris immediately around the tack, and a variable extent of chorioretinal adhesion. The penetration of the tacks in the choroid and sclera was associated with a localized scar and only a mild inflammatory reaction, but all tacks themselves were free of inflammatory cells and degradation. The two tacks remaining in place were tolerated by the posterior segment. After comparing and contrasting our findings with those documented in the rabbit model, we conclude that overcoming dislodgement problems will require improved insertion techniques and tack design.\r"

Although uncommon, metastasis to regional lymph nodes does occur, and there have been several reports of more distant metastasis. This tumor is characterized by the secretion of mucin. This mucin usually forms into pools surrounding the clusters of tumor cells. Less commonly, the mucin may collect within the tumor cells and not be secreted into the extracellular spaces. Such a \"mucin-poor\" form of the tumor involving the eyelid was recently seen and is reported here. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma are presented and the modes of treatment are discussed.\r"

We examined patients with leukoplakia as a control group with oral keratosis but no OLP. Forty percent of the OLP patients were suffering from diabetes, hypertension, or both. The occurrence of CIC positivity was higher in the OLP group with diabetes than in the group with OLP only. However, we could not find CIC positivity in our control patients with diabetes. The almost equal distribution of hypertension among, patients with OLP who tested positive for CIC and those who tested negative does not seem to support the hypothesis that this factor causes the CIC positivity in OLP. The same applies to other assumed factors such as age, medication, dental foci, or metal framework. In summary, we support the idea that CIC positivity may be the consequence of lichen itself, but diabetes and hypertension contribute to the development of erosive OLP lesions.\r"

Ten lymphomas were high-grade and two were classified as being low-grade malignancies. Immunocytologic characterization on cytospin material showed that all cases were B-cell derived with monoclonal expression of immunoglobulin light chains. Surgical biopsy material was available for histologic diagnosis in 8 of 12 cases. In 5 of these, the cytomorphologic and the histologic diagnoses were in agreement. With respect to the other 3, one case was histologically classified as an unspecified malignancy and one as a centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma, and in one case no malignant lesion could be found. The three cases were cytologically classified as large-cell centrocytic, centroblastic, and lymphoblastic lymphoma, respectively. We conclude that fine-needle aspiration cytology in conjunction with immunocytochemistry is a rapid, feasible, and atraumatic technique that is useful for diagnosing malignant lymphoma in the oral cavity.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first definitive report of a carcinoma primary to the oral cavity associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. In each case, the severity of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, or both very closely correlated with tumor growth. Surgical excision of the tumors or regression of tumor mass due to aggressive anticancer drug administration resulted in decreases in leukocyte number, serum calcium level, or both. In contrast, recurrence or regrowth of tumors induced further development of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, or both. It is therefore likely that humoral factors released by these oral carcinomas are responsible for the hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, or both.\r"

In other reports in which the resorption did affect the apices, the resorption usually affected only one, two, or three teeth.

Joints with disk displacements that reduced with condylar translation and joints with disk dislocation without reduction of the articular disk were compared with normal examinations. The mean measured joint space on tomographic examination decreased with MRI evidence of disk displacement and dislocation. Fourteen of twenty-five joints with MRI documentation of disk displacement or dislocation did show a tendency for some condylar displacement from a centric position. Only the joints with MRI evidence of total disk dislocation showed bony evidence of degenerative changes with tomography. The clinical cross-sectional study suggests that there can be changes seen in axially corrected tomographic examinations that may suggest the presence of disk displacement or significant internal derangement.\r"

These subjective assessments are similar to previously reported pilot studies but differ from previously published objective studies, which showed no significant difference between the three imaging techniques.

Frequent blood samples were collected from an indwelling intravenous catheter and CSF samples were collected via spinal needles inserted in the cervical (C7-T1 interspace) and lumbar (L3.4 interspace) regions at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 min after fentanyl administration. The concentration of fentanyl in blood and CSF samples were quantified by a sensitive and selective gas-liquid chromatography assay. Visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) were recorded every 5 min for the first hour. Coded syringes (one containing the appropriate fentanyl dose while the other contained an equivalent volume of saline) allowed the investigator administering the fentanyl and assessing VAPS to remain blinded as to which route of administration actually contained the fentanyl. There was minimal vascular uptake of fentanyl following epidural administration. Similarly, the permeation of fentanyl into cervical and lumbar CSF following intravenous administration was minimal and erratic such that only 4 of the 60 CSF samples had detectable fentanyl concentrations. In contrast, there was a rapid penetration of fentanyl across the dura mater following lumbar epidural administration. There was significantly fentanyl in lumbar CSF samples by 10 min in 5 patients, and by 20 min in all 6 patients. The mean maximum lumbar CSF concentration was 19.1 ng/ml, while the time associated with these maximum concentrations was 22.5 min. The mean maximum cervical CSF fentanyl concentrations were 10% of the lumbar CSF concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In most patients a lateralisation of the findings was observed: cutaneous and deep hyperalgesia were prevalent in the side of cluster headache attacks. The results indicate that in cluster headache, as in other pain syndromes, a lateralisation may be induced throughout the body, probably by phenomena of facilitation in the central nervous system and by activation of reflex arcs.\r"

Comparison of subjective and physiological responses to the administration of 0 and 30 g of lactulose in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that the 30 g lactulose dose produced significant increases in a number of measures reflecting the intra-intestinal pain stimulus.

As cervical dilation increased, there were significant increases in self-reported pain and observed pain on all the cited measures. Pain was characterized as 'discomforting' during early dilation and as 'distressing, horrible, excruciating' as dilation progressed. Significant increases in pain with increased dilation occurred on all measures for multigravidas but only on the VAS for primigravidas.\r"

Painful and non-painful stimuli were determined using a visual analog scale. SERPs were recorded from 16 healthy volunteers at 5 midline and 4 left and 4 right hemispheric sites. The differences between the amplitudes of attended and ignored stimuli were quantified with a baseline-to-peak measure. ANOVA results revealed no significant attention or stimulus intensity effects for N150 but highly significant differences in P200 and P300 amplitudes between attended and ignored stimuli. In addition, P200 and P300 amplitudes were larger for strong stimuli than for weak stimuli, with no significant differences between non-painful and painful stimuli. These findings are consistent with the existence of a relative, rather than an absolute, relationship between SERP component amplitudes and subjective pain reports. Furthermore, the data give evidence that attentional manipulations represent a powerful method to decrease the perception of pain and that, when used with subjective and behavioral measures, the SERP represents a valuable asset in the multidimensional approach to pain measurement and assessment.\r"

When mainly unmyelinated fibres were conducting, after 30-36 min of nerve compression, the pain threshold, induced by cold stimulation, was shifted towards higher temperatures (from 19.1 degrees C to 22.8 degrees C, mean values). Furthermore, the sensation of cold pain became more unpleasant and had a hot burning rather than a cold quality. These results indicate that a change in central decoding of the afferent input has occurred, possibly due to lack of inhibition normally exerted by concomitant activation of myelinated fibres. Whereas dramatic changes in the sensation of cold pain were observed during the course of nerve compression, no alteration in heat pain threshold was seen. This implies that heat pain threshold in hairy skin is due to activation of C nociceptor fibres without any significant contribution from myelinated nociceptor fibres. Furthermore, no gating from heat-sensitive myelinated fibre input was evident on heat pain threshold.\r"

Mechanical thresholds began to drop within 7 days of sciatic section and continued to decline for 2-3 weeks, resulting in significant hyperalgesia over the original saphenous and sciatic border zones lasting up to 310 days. Contralateral hyperalgesia, which is seen in tissue injury mechanical hyperalgesia, failed to develop. Collateral sprouting of high-threshold mechanoreceptors from the saphenous nerve into the denervated deep and cutaneous tissue was observed. The extent of cutaneous sprouting did not significantly correlate with the severity of hyperalgesia. The simultaneous uniform reduction of mechanical thresholds across all tarsometatarsal areas after chronic sciatic section is consistent with a central modulation of nociceptive afferent input. The severity and temporal development of the hyperalgesia strongly correlated with the extent of autotomy behavior. This animal model of chronic mechanical hyperalgesia following peripheral nerve section closely resembles a human neuropathic pain syndrome and may provide an experimental opportunity to advance our understanding of the neuropathology subserving chronic pain.\r"

The pain response curve induced by 0.5% formalin was biphasic, having 2 peaks, from 0 to 5 min (first phase) and from 15 to 20 min (second phase). A low concentration of formalin was used, allowing the effects of weak analgesics to be detected. Centrally acting drugs such as narcotics inhibited both phases equally. Peripherally acting drugs such as aspirin, oxyphenbutazone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone only inhibited the second phase. Aminopyrine and mefenamic acid which acted on both central and peripheral sites inhibited both phases, but the second phase was inhibited by lower doses. Thus, this method enables one to easily distinguish the site of action of analgesics. Furthermore, pain response in the first phase was inhibited by capsaicin-treated desensitization and Des-Arg9-(Leu8)-bradykinin (bradykinin inhibitor). The second phase was inhibited by compound 48/80 pretreatment, indomethacin and bradykinin inhibitor. Therefore, it is suggested that substance P and bradykinin participate in the manifestation of the first phase response, and histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and bradykinin are involved in the second phase. These results indicate that the first and second phase responses induced by formalin have distinct characteristic properties, and it is a very useful method for examining pain, nociception and its modulation by pharmacological or other means.\r"

  ".W": "Habituation of rats to the testing environment and procedures reduces flexor withdrawal latencies to those of spinalised animals. We have now recorded surface temperatures at 3 sites on the tail and tail-flick latencies simultaneously in experimentally naive (novice) rats and in habituated rats. At usual ambient temperatures (20 +/- 1 degree C), tail temperatures fluctuated in accordance with the predictions of an on-off controller. There was an inverse correlation between the tail-flick latency and the temperature at the site of noxious stimulation. A similar correlation was found when the pre-stimulus temperature of the tip of the tail was held at temperatures ranging from 21 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Habituated animals exhibited a similar linear regression slope factor but lower latencies than novice animals at each temperature. We conclude (1) that tail-flick latency is determined partly by the pre-stimulus temperature at the site of noxious thermal stimulation, and (2) that the effects of habituation on tail-flick latency are more likely to be explained by differences in nociception than in regional vasomotor tone.\r"

Locomotor and overt behavioral activities were unaffected at any dose tested. These data suggest the potential use of buspirone in the management of specific types of pain.\r"

We predicted that: (1) chronic pain patients, compared with normal controls, would show more interference to words drawn from the MPQ, and (2) affective/evaluative descriptors would produce greater interference than sensory descriptors. There was support for the first hypothesis but not the second. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed.\r"

Twenty patients had undergone no change in narcotic dose or type greater than or equal to 7 days (stable dose, SD, group), and 20 patients had undergone an increase of greater than or equal to 30% in dose less than or equal to 3 days before (increased dose, ID, group). Age, primary tumor, type, dose and route of narcotic were not different between the SD and ID group. Cognitive tests (finger tapping, FT, 10 and 30 sec, arithmetic, A, reverse memory of digits, RM, and visual memory, VM) were performed in all patients before and 45 min after their morning dose of narcotics for 2 consecutive days. Mean percentual change in FT 10 sec, FT 30 sec, A, RM, and VM after the narcotic dose were 97 +/- 9%, 100 +/- 14%, 100 +/- 13%, 100 +/- 15%, 98 +/- 19%, in the SD group, vs. 77 +/- 14% (P less than 0.001), 83 +/- 13% (P less than 0.001), 124 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001), 60 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001) and 68 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001) in the ID group, respectively. Our results suggest that patients who undergo a significant increase in the dose of intermittent narcotics experience significant cognitive impairment, that disappears after 1 week of the increase. More research is needed to better characterize the cognitive toxicity of intermittent narcotics, and to determine the cognitive effects of long acting narcotics, continuous infusions, or of the addition of amphetamines.\r"

Each patient may have psychological characteristics that modify this response to aversive stimuli. To test for such characteristics, 76 female patients undergoing abdominal gynecologic procedures were given psychological tests (i.e., the Chance External, Powerful Others External, and Internal subscales of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control; the Activities of Daily Living scale; and the Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Patients utilized PCA for postoperative analgesia. At the completion of PCA, patients were given a questionnaire assessing both the level of pain and degree of satisfaction with pain relief. Correlational analysis compared the level of pain and degree of satisfaction with results of psychological testing. Results showed that female patients with an external locus of control had higher levels of pain and greater dissatisfaction with PCA. An internal locus of control was predictive of lower pain scores and increased satisfaction. PCA effectiveness, as measured by the level of pain and degree of patient satisfaction, correlated with results of psychological testing. The delineation of these and other possible modifiers of PCA efficacy may define populations that are optimally responsive to PCA.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight gynecologic surgical patients using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) were given several psychological questionnaires and their pain was monitored postoperatively. Pain scores were recorded hourly on postoperative day 1. In addition, patients were asked to score retrospectively their overall pain experience while using PCA (Patient Overall Evaluation). Patients having had a history of pain for at least 6 months were considered to have 'chronic pain,' while those who had no history of chronic pain were grouped as 'acute pain' patients. Chronic pain patients spent more time in 'moderate' pain than did acute pain patients. While patients with a history of chronic pain had higher scores on the hourly pain scale compared to acute pain patients, there were no differences between the two groups on the Patient Overall Evaluation. In addition, chronic pain patients reported the same pain levels after completion of PCA as they did during its use, in contrast to acute pain patients whose retrospective pain levels were higher than during PCA use. Compared to acute pain patients, chronic pain patients had higher scores on both the Hypochondriasis and the Hysteria scales of the MMPI. A history of chronic pain may affect the use of patient-controlled analgesia since chronic pain patients may accommodate to a 'moderate' pain level which approximates their preoperative perception of pain. By contrast, acute pain patients who have no 'chronic pain experience' may self-administer pain medication so as to attain a predominately 'mild' level of pain.\r"

The threshold in an area of local tissue damage created by routine heel lances was half the threshold on the intact heel on the other side. This indicated a hypersensitivity to tissue damage analogous to tenderness or hyperalgesia reported in adults. In a double-blind study, treatment of the damaged area with the topical anaesthetic cream, EMLA, was found to reverse this hypersensitivity or in other words increase the flexion reflex threshold. Treatment with placebo had no effect. The results show that the newborn infant central nervous system is capable of mounting a chronic pain response to local injury which can be reduced by local anaesthetic.\r"

  ".U": "90045582\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with chronic low back pain present with a mixture of symptoms and signs. Some are a direct consequence of physical pathology whereas others are attributable to associated and appropriate psychological and behavioural changes. At times the latter may be out of keeping with the degree of physical pathology and thus have specific significance in terms of the affective and cognitive disturbances that are also present and which may be the basis for abnormal illness behaviour. In an attempt to demonstrate more clearly the relationship between physical, psychological and behavioural components of illness, this paper draws on two data sets in patients with low back pain. The first explores the relationship between behavioural symptoms and signs, objective physical impairment, pain and disability and psychometric measures of distress together with scales making up the illness behaviour questionnaire (IBQ) of Pilowsky and Spence. A second data set is used to assess the value of the IBQ in understanding how psychological distress and behavioural signs and symptoms are related to the outcome of surgical treatment. The results gained reveal that behavioural symptoms and signs are directly related to the physical severity of low back disorder, the patient's report of pain and disability and the outcome of surgical treatment. Scores on the IBQ were strongly related to measures of affective disturbance and psychological distress. More specifically the disease affirmation scale of the IBQ, incorporating scales for disease conviction and psychological versus somatic focussing was an important dimension in relation to the behavioural symptoms and signs, thereby confirming results gained by other workers. Disease conviction and lack of response to clinicians' reassurances regarding illness - a situation in which abnormal illness behaviour is often deemed to exist - should not be seen simply as a function of the disease process, but more as a psychological coping mechanism for certain individuals under stress. The significance of this observation is discussed in relation to decisions regarding the overall assessment of chronic pain patients and their treatment.\r"

CRTs were also measured in 20 healthy controls. CRT results were summarized using 10%, 50% and 90% percentiles. On the basis of these values a 'variation index' was calculated (90-10%): 50%, describing the spread of the reaction time values. No statistically significant differences were found in PVAS, SVAS and CRT before and after initiation of epidural opioid administration. Calculation of confidence limits of median differences showed absolutely no tendency towards differences in CRT between the treatments. Only 4 patients experienced both increased pain relief and less sedation on epidural opioids. Comparing CRT percentiles of the cancer patients with the controls, differences were found between the control group and the oral opioid group, the latter being statistically significantly slower in the 90% percentiles (P = 0.018) and variation indexes (P = 0.018). In conclusion, no differences were found between CRT values and VAS scores in cancer patients treated with chronic oral opioids versus epidural opioids. Therefore at this dose level of chronic opioid treatment, the advantage of epidural administration seems questionable.\r"

The sample of 150 subjects was drawn from 2 populations of persons with chronic low back pain: 87 individuals who were receiving care at a university low back pain clinic, and 63 individuals who had applied for (but not yet received) Social Security compensation on the basis of low back pain. All subjects had worked at least 3 months prior to their latest unemployment period and were currently out of work. Initial assessment included a medical history, physical examination, biomechanical testing, psychiatric interview, and MMPI testing. All subjects were followed up 6 months later to determine whether they had returned to work. Cross-sectional group comparisons at the time of initial assessment showed that, after controlling for the effects of age, the two samples differed on several physical and biomechanical measures, the Social Security group reflecting a more chronic picture. Group differences on physical variables were found, but most significant differences disappeared when adjusted for length of time out-of-work. Longitudinal analyses showed that few objective physical or biomechanical measures were associated with return-to-work at 6 months, while a number of psychosocial variables were significant predictors of 6-month work status. The data suggest that exclusive reliance on the physical examination to determine level of disability, without consideration of psychosocial conditions, and without adjusting for the confounding effects of age and length of time out-of-work, is not empirically justified. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the relative contribution of each predictor to outcome and to illustrate the hypothetical effects of changes in the levels of selected risk factors on the likelihood of return-to-work. Implications for interventions with low back pain patients are discussed and future research directions suggested.\r"

The results were compared with those of RSV-negative children hospitalized with identical indications during the 3 peak months of the RSV epidemic (N = 91) or for the 3 months after the outbreak (N = 99). A high frequency of pneumonia and acute otitis media were found in both RSV-positive and RSV-negative children during the epidemic, but not in control patients after the epidemic. Bacterial infection, based on a significant rise of antibody titer and/or on detection of pneumococcal antigen in serum or urine, was observed in 39% of the children with RSV infection. The respective figures were 24% in RSV-negative children hospitalized during the epidemic and 8% after the epidemic. Our observations stress the role of RSV as a predisposing agent for secondary bacterial infection in the airways of children. The most common bacteria involved in the mixed RSV-bacterial infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, the latter being found only in pneumonic patients. The presence or absence of pneumonia or acute otitis media was not significantly correlated with evidence of pneumococcal infection. We conclude that a bacterial pathogen should be actively sought when managing patients with lower respiratory tract syndromes, especially in those who have evidence of RSV infection.\r"

Ceftriaxone was administered intramuscularly in a once a day dose of approximately 80 mg/kg body weight for 5 days. Chloramphenicol was given orally for 3 weeks in a daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg/kg body weight divided into 4 doses. In the ceftriaxone group 23 of 29 patients were cured, 2 improved, 1 failed and 2 relapsed. For those who received chloramphenicol 22 of the 30 patients were cured, 5 improved, 1 failed and 2 relapsed. In none of the patients in either group were adverse effects recorded. The overall results of this comparative study suggest that short term treatment of typhoid fever with ceftriaxone is as effective and safe as conventional treatment with chloramphenicol.\r"

To determine whether embryopathy is detectable in HIV-exposed African infants, 85 infants of HIV-seropositive mothers and 98 infants of HIV-seronegative mothers in Nairobi, Kenya, were examined for minor and major anomalous features shortly after birth. No mother used intravenous drugs. With the exception of growth failure no anomalous feature was associated with in utero HIV exposure. No increase in the number of anomalous features per infant was correlated with HIV, nor did any infant have the reported malformation syndrome. Thus in this population of African infants examination for anomalous features during the neonatal period failed to identify those infants with fetal exposure to HIV.\r"

Although several studies on IgG subclass deficiency in IgA-deficient subjects have been reported, most have been unable to assess the incidence of IgG4 deficiency because the limitations of the assay methods used have often made a distinction between low normal and subnormal concentrations impossible. Having developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay capable of measuring concentrations of all the IgG subclasses in healthy subjects of all ages and having established age-normal ranges for IgG subclasses using this assay, we measured IgG subclass concentrations in 73 IgA-deficient patients, the majority of whom were children with recurrent respiratory infections. The results showed that IgG4 deficiency occurred in 26% of the patients and was the most common IgG subclass deficiency found. IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 deficiencies occurred, respectively, in 10, 12 and 8% of the patients. IgA-IgG4 deficiency occurred in 16% of the patients; IgA-IgG2-IgG4 in 4%; and IgG1-IgG2-IgG4, IgA-IgG1 and IgA-IgG2-IgG3 each occurred in 3%. Other subclass deficiencies or combinations of deficiencies were less frequent. Our results suggest that IgG4 deficiency even in the absence of IgG2 deficiency may be an important but hitherto largely unrecognized factor in infection proneness in some IgA-deficient patients.\r"

Therefore, management must include measures to control these risk factors as well as reduce blood pressure. In patients with hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, some antihypertensive drugs must be used with extreme caution or avoided altogether because of possible side effects.

Cost-effectiveness studies of specific clinical situations indicate that costs for children are decreased by a shortened hospital stay, the need for less antibiotic therapy, and avoidance of splenectomy. Therapy for adults must be individualized and varies depending on whether the goal is a rapid platelet response (eg, before emergency surgery) or avoidance of the risks of corticosteroid therapy and splenectomy. The availability of a safe immunomodulating agent makes intravenous immunoglobulin therapy a potentially useful tool for a wide variety of diseases.\r"

  ".U": "90046326\r", 
  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia is an imbalance between consumption and production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that leads to ATP depletion and a cascade of biochemical events. Why some patients have pain during these events while others do not is unclear, but some studies indicate that a combination of pain threshold and magnitude of ischemia may be at work. Ischemia can occur during vigorous or daily activities or at rest and can be influenced by mental stress. It is most common in the morning hours, possibly because heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility rise rapidly in the morning and factors that increase coronary vessel tone and reduce blood flow also increase during these hours. The specific pathophysiology of an ischemic episode depends on whether the patient also has chronic stable coronary disease, variant angina, or unstable angina, not on whether the episode is silent or symptomatic.\r"

  ".W": "Anginal pain alone is not a sensitive marker of ischemia. In one study of 2,014 completely asymptomatic men, 2.5% were found to have silent ischemia when they underwent treadmill exercise testing. Another method of detection, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, can be used in patients who cannot exercise or may be used to clarify results of exercise testing. Many investigators believe that the two tests provide complementary information on the patient's response to high demand and to daily-living activities. Other methods for determining necessary treatment and prognosis include dipyridamole with thallium perfusion scanning, nuclear exercise testing, coronary angiography, and catheterization. The cost, required frequency of retesting, and incidence of false results should be considered before screening is started.\r"

  ".U": "90046328\r", 
  ".W": "The precise mechanism responsible for silent myocardial ischemia has not been established, but available data suggest that both an increase in oxygen demand and a decrease in coronary blood flow may be responsible. Studies indicate that more than 60 minutes of silent ischemia during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring correlates with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and recurrent symptoms requiring coronary revascularization. Even in patients with shorter, repeated episodes of silent ischemia, small areas of subendocardial necrosis may develop that eventually lead to progressive left ventricular dysfunction, which increases the risk of subsequent mortality. Antianginal therapy, even though effective in control of symptoms, does not abolish silent ischemia. Further study of the pathogenesis of silent ischemia is needed before an effective treatment plan can be established.\r"
