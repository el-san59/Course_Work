  ".W": "Disruption of local cortical blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and CO2 reactivity, or vasoparalysis, has been documented in humans after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Generally, the degree of vasoparalysis is related to the patient's clinical grade. Using intraoperative measurement of local CBF, we evaluated pressure autoregulation and CO2 reactivity in patients after SAH. Fourteen patients with SAH and 10 patients with asymptomatic aneurysm underwent craniotomy for clipping of their aneurysms. During operation, local CBF was recorded with thermal conductivity probes placed on the middle frontal gyrus, 4 to 6 cm from the nearest point of retraction. Before retractor placement, CBF was measured with the PCO2 at 25 and 35 mm Hg and the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) between 70 and 80 mm Hg. After aneurysm clipping, flows were again measured. With the PCO2 at 25 mm Hg, the MABP was raised from 65 to 85 mm Hg. The PCO2 was then allowed to rise to 35 mm Hg, after which the MABP was lowered from 85 to 65 mm Hg. Six patients underwent operation within the 1st week after SAH (Grade I, n = 3; Grade II, n = 3). The remainder (n = 8) were operated on 9 days to 3 months after SAH. After aneurysm clipping, significant CBF changes (P less than 0.001) with PCO2 alteration occurred in control patients and those operated on more than 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in CBF in patients operated on within 7 days after SAH. Changes in CBF reactivity to alteration of MABP were significantly larger in early operation patients than in other groups (P less than 0.008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We analyzed 148 Medicare patients in these non-CC stratified neurosurgical DRGs and found that patients with a greater number of CCs had higher hospital resource consumption, substantial financial risk under DRGs, and a poorer outcome than patients with no CCs. These data suggest that the current DRG classification scheme may be inequitable vis-a-vis the non-CC stratified neurosurgical DRGs at our hospital. Hospitals that treat significant numbers of these patients may face disincentives to care for them under prospective Medicare DRG reimbursement.\r"

Total parenteral nutrition has been used in pregnancy complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum. However, little has been done to study the nutritional aspects of hyperemesis or the maternal effects of total parenteral nutrition when given during the first trimester of pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine the nutritional state of pregnancy complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum and the effects of total parenteral nutrition on maternal nutrition and fetal outcome when given during the first trimester of pregnancy. Using a standard method of indirect calorimetry, the basal metabolic expenditure and adjusted metabolic expenditure were determined, and appropriate calories were calculated for each patient. The patients were then started on total parenteral nutrition. Follow-up indirect calorimetry studies showed improved nutritional status, with return of anabolic parameters. The results of this study support the conclusion that total parenteral nutrition given during the first trimester is a safe and effective method of nutritional support.\r"

Animals were terminated at 1-, 4-, and 6-week intervals and the cochleas were examined with the light microscope to document the presence or absence of hydrops, or were evaluated with the scanning electron microscope to assess sensory-cell damage. Hydrops was observed in 67% of the animals in the combined duct-obstruction/cochleostomy group, in 100% of the duct-obstruction alone group, and in 0% of the cochleostomy alone group. Widespread sensory-cell degeneration was observed with the scanning electron microscope in the combined and the cochleostomy alone groups.\r"

The great distance between the islands, primitive conditions, and shortages of medical facilities and supplies must all be considered when a technique is designed for the closure of these perforations. Such a technique, using dissolvable sutures to position and support a medial temporalis fascia graft, is presented. A suture is used to place traction on the graft to assure proper placement under the anterior remnant or anterior canal wall skin. The graft is placed medial to the remnant but lateral to the malleus handle, which has been carefully dissected free of epithelium. Two hundred eighty-one cases were followed for 6 months or more, with a success rate of slightly more than ninety-five percent. Complications of blunting, lateralization, reperforation of the graft, and cholesteatoma formation are discussed.\r"

Both drugs are effective single agents, have shown synergistic activity in vitro, and can act as radiation sensitizers. A 5-day course of radiotherapy, with simultaneous HU and continuous infusion 5-FU, was followed by a 9-day rest period; cycles were repeated until completion of XRT. Sixteen patients have completed their therapy. Eleven patients had recurrent disease after previous therapy with surgery (11 patients), radiotherapy (9 patients), and combination chemotherapy (4 patients). Five patients had not received previous local therapy. These patients had persistent disease after induction chemotherapy and/or were inoperable because of poor general medical condition. Of 15 patients evaluable for response, 9 had complete response, including 5 patients who had earlier local therapy; 5 had partial response; and 1 failed to respond. Toxicities included mild myelosuppression and mucositis. No unusual complication related to previous radiotherapy was observed. This regimen has shown impressive activity in a cohort of patients who are not usually responsive to other types of currently available therapy. We are continuing our investigation to further define efficacy, toxicity, and maximally tolerated doses of this regimen.\r"

Bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. This study investigates the effect of Hemophilus Influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. Ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240 minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) measurement. H. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the CBF by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. S. epidermidis decreased CBF by 44% with the bacterial broth. A sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis had no significant effect on CBF within a 240-minute period. H. influenzae and S. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.\r"

Measurements were made before and after pars flaccida modifications at 18 frequencies between 100 and 4000 Hz. Four pars flaccida modifications were studied: (1) acoustic insulation of the pars flaccida to the ear canal with a silicone rubber baffle, (2) stiffening the pars flaccida with cyanoacrylate cement, (3) decreasing the tension of the pars flaccida with a nonperforating incision, and (4) perforation of the pars flaccida. All of the modifications (except the perforation) had a minimal effect on umbo displacement; this seems to imply that the pars flaccida has a minor acoustic role in human beings.\r"

When the child is unable to take these anticonvulsants orally, he or she may be given parenteral doses of phenobarbital or phenytoin. In many cases, these two medications have failed previously to control seizures, leading to the use of the more recently developed drugs. The use of rectal preparations of some anticonvulsant medications is highly useful and effective when the child is unable to take oral medications because of repeated vomiting, gastrointestinal surgery, and status epilepticus associated with lack of venous access. Rectal use of anticonvulsants has a role in the management of hospitalized seizure patients and can be learned by parents needing to treat their children's seizures at home while awaiting other medical care.\r"

  ".W": "The guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which mediate hormonal regulation of many membrane functions, are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. We have cloned and characterized cDNA from a human T-cell library encoding a form of alpha i that is different from the human alpha i subtypes previously reported [Didsbury, J. R., Ho, Y.-S. & Snyderman, R. (1987) FEBS Lett. 211, 160-164 and Bray, P., Carter, A., Guo, V., Puckett, C., Kamholz, J., Spiegel, A. & Nirenberg, M. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 5115-5119]. alpha i is the alpha subunit of a class of G proteins that inhibits adenylate cyclase and regulates other enzymes and ion channels. This cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 354 amino acids and is assigned to encode the alpha i-3 subtype of G proteins on the basis of its similarity to other alpha i-like cDNAs and the presence of a predicted site for ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin. We have determined the expression of mRNA for this and two other subtypes of human alpha i (alpha i-1 and alpha i-2) in a variety of human fetal tissues and in human cell lines. All three alpha i subtypes were present in the tissues tested. However, analysis of individual cell types reveals specificity of alpha i-1 expression. mRNA for alpha i-1 is absent in T cells, B cells, and monocytes but is present in other cell lines. The finding of differential expression of alpha i-1 genes may permit characterization of distinct physiological roles for this alpha i subunit. mRNA for alpha i-2 and alpha i-3 was found in all the primary and transformed cell lines tested. Thus, some cells contain all three alpha i subtypes. This observation raises the question of how cells prevent cross talk among receptors that are coupled to effectors through such similar alpha proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Cells of the monocyte-macrophage series must carry out discrete accessory-cell functions during the process of antigen-specific T-cell activation. One of these functions is the cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene products, which are involved in the presentation of foreign antigen to T cells. Previously, we reported that murine peritoneal macrophages infected with the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania donovani had suppressed responses to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) for the induction of MHC class II antigen expression. To determine the molecular basis for this suppression, we examined in the present series of experiments the interaction of this organism with cells of the murine macrophage tumor cell line P388D1. When infected with Leishmania, these cells were also markedly unresponsive to IFN-gamma for the induction of MHC class II antigen expression. This finding was not the result of a defect at the level of the IFN-gamma receptor. Thus, when 125I-labeled IFN-gamma was used, infected macrophages were found to express normal numbers of high-affinity IFN-gamma receptors, and ligand-receptor binding resulted in rapid internalization of labeled IFN-gamma. Despite normal ligand-receptor interactions, the induction in infected cells of mRNA encoding MHC (H-2) class II I-A alpha and beta chains in response to IFN-gamma was markedly suppressed. However, infected cells had normal levels of mRNA encoding the cytoskeletal protein actin. These findings indicate that Leishmania interferes with IFN-gamma induction of macrophage MHC class II antigen expression by down-regulating lymphokine induction of MHC class II mRNA. Suppression of class II expression by this intracellular parasite may prevent subsequent T-cell recognition of infected macrophages and thus favor parasite survival.\r"

Transformation of embryonic rodent cells by single oncogenes is reputed either not to occur or to require specialized circumstances. It has not been known how the large group of oncogenes that encode protein-tyrosine kinases might fit into this scheme. We now report that v-src, a prototype for the kinase oncogenes, can convert rat embryo fibroblasts to a fully transformed and tumorigenic phenotype when the gene is expressed vigorously. By contrast, v-src had no demonstrable effect on diploid human fibroblasts. Our results sustain the view that it is possible for at least some oncogenes to achieve a potency sufficient for unilateral tumorigenesis.\r"

We present evidence that B. subtilis produces an extracellular factor(s) that is required, in addition to starvation conditions, for efficient sporulation. This factor is secreted and accumulates in a cell density-dependent fashion such that cells at a low density sporulate poorly under conditions in which cells at a high density sporulate efficiently. Conditioned medium (sterile filtrate) from cells grown to a high density contains this extracellular differentiation factor (EDF-A) and stimulates spore formation of cells at low density under normal starvation conditions. EDF-A is heat-resistant, protease-sensitive, and dialyzable, indicating that it is at least in part an oligopeptide. Production of EDF-A is reduced or eliminated in spoOA and spoOB mutants, which are defective in many processes associated with the end of vegetative growth. Mutations in abrB, which suppress many of the pleiotropic phenotypes of spoOA mutants, restore production of EDF-A.\r"

In the r environment, population sizes were small and resources for larvae and adults were abundant. In contrast the populations in the K environment were large and crowded, and resources, such as food and space, were in short supply. The relative competitive ability for food has been estimated for each population. Populations from the K environment consume food at a rate that is 58% greater than the average rate for the r population. The differentiation of competitive abilities in these populations is due to natural selection and is consistent with predictions from the theory of evolutionary ecology.\r"

The proteins they encode are very similar to each other but are distinct from (although related to) the pMT4-encoded protein. Here I use recombinant inbred strains to localize pMT4 at or close to the mouse brown (b) locus. I suggest that the gene mapping to c is the authentic tyrosinase gene, whereas that mapping to b encodes a tyrosinase-related protein. All b mutations in laboratory strains are associated with the same diagnostic Taq I fragment, suggesting that all derive from the same original mutation.

The existence of an animal model for this disease, the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, makes it an attractive candidate for developing new therapies that involve gene transfer into liver. As a first step toward the development of these therapies, we report the use of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to correct the genetic defect in hepatocytes isolated from WHHL rabbits. A series of retroviral vectors that express the gene for human LDLR were constructed, each differing in the transcriptional elements used to drive LDLR expression. Helper-free amphotropic virus stocks representing each construct were then used to infect primary cultures of hepatocytes that were isolated from newborn WHHL rabbits. The efficiency of transduction, as measured by Southern analysis of integrated proviral sequences, ranged from 20% to 100%. Expression of human LDLR was analyzed by blot hybridization analysis of total cellular RNA and by biochemical and in situ analyses of transduced cultures for receptor function. The vector in which the expression of LDLR was driven by the viral long terminal repeat sequence produced the greatest quantity of LDLR RNA and protein in WHHL hepatocytes; LDLR activity approached normal levels in these cultures.\r"

  ".W": "Transfection of deleted forms of the human interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha; also called CD25 or Tac antigen) gene (IL2RA) promoter revealed a requirement for sequences 3' of base -317 for phytohemagglutinin- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced promoter activation in CD4+ Jurkat T cells. In contrast, sequences 3' of base -271 were sufficient for promoter induction in CD4-/CD8- YT-1 T cells or Jurkat cells expressing the transactivator protein (tat-I) of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Gel retardation assays revealed that nuclear extracts from induced, but not uninduced, Jurkat and YT-1 cells mediated the formation of two specific DNA-protein complexes with oligonucleotides spanning the region of the IL2RA promoter from position -291 to -245, which contains two imperfect direct repeats (IDRs). Consistent with the different 5' sequence requirements for promoter activation in Jurkat and YT-1 cells, oligonucleotides corresponding to the region from -267 to -243 (downstream IDR and flanking region) formed only one complex with induced Jurkat extracts but two complexes with induced YT-1 extracts. Oligonucleotides containing the region of the IL2RA promoter from -293 to -270 (upstream IDR and flanking region) failed to bind protein in either cell type. In further support of the biological significance of these DNA-protein interactions, the IL2RA oligonucleotide from -291 to -245 proved to be sufficient in either orientation to confer PMA inducibility to the mitogen-insensitive thymidine kinase gene promoter in Jurkat cells. Together, these findings suggest that the interaction of inducible DNA binding proteins with the IL2RA promoter between bases -291 and -245 plays an important role in mitogen-induced changes in the transcriptional activity of this receptor gene. Furthermore, the requisite 5' sequences appear to differ in T cells depending upon the nature of the activation signal and perhaps the stage of cellular maturation.\r"

The antibody has been used to follow the extraction of two peptide fragments (9.5 and 12 kDa) by immunoblotting. The link between the PHF as a morphological entity and these peptides has been established independently by photoaffinity labeling with a chemical ligand to the PHF core. Sequence analysis of these peptides was used to design oligonucleotide probes for cloning a cognate cDNA, which leads to its identification as human microtubule-associated tau protein. The sequencing of the 9.5- and 12-kDa peptides shows they are derived from a conserved region of tau containing three repeating segments. Since these fragments have been copurified with the Pronase-resistant core and are only released by subsequent steps, the corresponding part of the tau molecule must be tightly bound in the PHF core.\r"

We reexamined this concept by measuring spontaneous as well as arachidonate-induced PGI2 biosynthesis in aortic segments from nonatherosclerotic and cholesterol-fed atherosclerotic New Zealand White rabbits. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation was also measured. Formation of PGI2, as well as TXA2, as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of their metabolites, was increased in atherosclerotic aortic segments relative to nonatherosclerotic segments (P less than or equal to 0.05) at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of incubation with arachidonate. Pretreatment of arterial segments with indomethacin inhibited PGI2 as well as TXA2 formation, whereas pretreatment with the selective TXA2 inhibitor OKY-046 inhibited only TXA2 release, thus confirming the identity of icosanoids. To confirm the RIA data, aortic segments were incubated with [14C]arachidonate prior to stimulation with unlabeled arachidonate. The uptake of arachidonate was similar, but the release of incorporated [14C]arachidonate was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater in atherosclerotic segments than in nonatherosclerotic ones. Conversions of released [14C]arachidonate to 6-keto[14C]prostaglandin F1 alpha and [14C]thromboxane B2 were similar in the two types of aortic segments. Thus, synthesis of PGI2 as well as TXA2 is increased in atherosclerosis, and this alteration in arachidonate metabolism is related to increased release of arachidonate.\r"

Conversely, expression of the NF68 gene was relatively low during development and regeneration.

The high level of class II beta-tubulin expression found in developing and regenerating neurons occurs during the longitudinal growth of axons. In contrast, induction of NF68 gene expression is associated with the radial growth of axons in maturing neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to analyze hospital cost, resource utilization, and outcome by age for a large group of hospitalized plastic surgical patients using the DRG format. Hospital cost per patient for all plastic surgical admissions (both inpatient and potentially ambulatory patients) treated (N = 1632) at an academic medical center increased with age and peaked for plastic surgical patients 75 to 80 years of age ($11,585 per patient). Although DRG payment would have produced an aggregate profit of $2,404,854, older plastic surgical patients (65 years of age and above) generally produced losses. Older plastic surgical patients demonstrated a longer hospital length of stay, a greater severity of illness, a higher percent of outliers, and a greater mortality than younger plastic surgical patients. In addition, older plastic surgical patients had higher clinical resource utilization based on a number of clinical parameters such as emergency admission, SICU utilization, need for blood transfusions, and need for plasma product infusions. This study suggests that the current DRG reimbursement methodology may be inequitable vis-a-vis the older plastic surgical patient. As additional pressures encourage the performance of more ambulatory procedures (previously performed as inpatients), our profit margins may decline and possibly affect our ability to provide quality plastic surgical care.\r"

The authors found ten cases of heterotopic gray matter on magnetic resonance (MR) images. The lesions had a signal intensity that was isointense compared with that of gray matter on T1, spin-density, and T2-weighted images. Nine of the ten cases were associated with a seizure disorder. The tenth case, discovered during a workup for metastatic lung disease, was confirmed with pathologic studies. Heterotopic gray matter is the presence of cortical neurons in an abnormal location, which may be periventricular (nodular) or within the white matter (laminar). A knowledge of heterotopic gray matter and its association with seizures may prevent the misinterpretation of findings on MR images.\r"

Patients in each treatment arm underwent exploratory staging laparotomy followed by concurrent radiation therapy and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients treated with photons received 6,000 cGy over a period of 10 weeks; patients treated with helium irradiation received a 6,000-7,000-cGy-equivalent dose over a period of 8-9 weeks. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients in the two treatment arms (P = .29). Patients treated with helium ions had a slightly longer median survival (7.8 months) than the photon-treated patients (6.5 months). Local control rates were slightly higher in the helium-treated patients (10% vs 5%). Complications included one chemotherapy-related death. Four of the five helium-treated patients who survived longer than 18 months died of local failure without distant metastases. These results suggest that more aggressive local therapy could result in improved survival in helium-treated patients.\r"

The activated alpha K subunit from human erythrocytes activated the channel in subpicomolar concentrations. The beta gamma dimer from bovine brain activated the channel in nanomolar concentrations. These results support the view that, physiologically, the alpha subunit activates the channel.\r"

  ".W": "Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is known to be secreted through the coronary sinus into the systemic circulation, its actual secretion rate has not been thoroughly investigated. The immunoreactive ANP concentrations in plasma samples from the ascending aorta and coronary sinus in 11 patients with the coronary artery disease were measured and the coronary sinus flow rate using the continuous thermodilution method was simultaneously determined at the time of sampling. These variables were also determined during the intravenous infusion of synthetic alpha-human ANP at 0.025 microgram/kg.min in 7 of the 11 patients. In the basal state, the plasma concentration of ANP was 61 +/- 6 (standard error) pg/ml in the aorta and 541 +/- 40 pg/ml in the coronary sinus, and the coronary sinus flow index was 57.3 +/- 12.3 ml/min.m2. Thus, the secretion rate of ANP was determined to be 14.4 +/- 2.8 ng/min.m2. The secretion rate of ANP correlated significantly with the plasma concentration of ANP in the aorta (r = 0.65, p less than 0.05). The ANP infusion, which decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure from 8.0 +/- 0.6 to 6.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), elevated the plasma concentrations of ANP in the aorta and coronary sinus by 701% (p less than 0.001) and 33% (p less than 0.05), respectively, and decreased the secretion rate of ANP by 40% (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the circulating plasma concentration of ANP may reflect the secretion rate of ANP and that an increase in circulating ANP directly or indirectly reduces ANP secretion.\r"

Questionnaires were sent to 628 physicians, mainly in New Jersey; 145 responses were received and analyzed. A separate questionnaire was sent to 9 pacemaker manufacturers to solicit information concerning the volume of pacemaker sales and their opinions on a variety of subjects. The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation declined for the first time: it dropped from 518 devices per million population in 1981 to 374 in 1985. Sinus node dysfunction was the chief indication for permanent pacing in 52% of primary implantations; conduction disorders of the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje system accounted for 41% and ventricular tachyarrhythmias for 2%. Dual-chamber pacing modes were used less frequently than was predicted in 1981, accounting for 30% of primary and 19% of replacement pacemakers. More than 43% of programmable pulse generators were never reprogrammed after implantation. Surveys such as this continue to provide useful information despite obstacles encountered in the use of questionnaires. Important differences in practice patterns and outcomes were identified between surgeons and nonsurgeons, and between frequent and infrequent implanters. These differences reinforce the suggestion that implanters should work at a volume sufficient to maintain their expertise, and that cooperation between surgeons and nonsurgeons would lead to improvements in patient selection, surgical results and optimal pacemaker programming and follow-up care. Better results could be achieved by adopting the continent-wide system of a pacemaker registry now used in Eastern Europe and Great Britain.\r"

In over 70% of cases, this lesion is associated with midline thoracoabdominal defects or other congenital malformations of the heart. The diverticulum is thought to occur early in embryogenesis from an outpouching of the endomyocardium through a weak region in the left ventricular wall, but its exact etiology is uncertain. The case of a 6-year-old white boy who died suddenly while playing is presented. Autopsy revealed a ruptured diverticulum of the left ventricular apex with massive hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. No other abnormalities were found. The pertinent literature is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma fatty acids (FA) from C14:0 to C22:6 omega 3 were measured in five healthy subjects and in 27 patients with liver cirrhosis. According to the assessment of triceps skinfold, mid-arm muscle circumference, and serum albumin concentration, patients were prospectively included in three groups: group A (n = 7) with acceptable nutritional status (including good nutrition and mild malnutrition), group B (n = 10) with moderate malnutrition, and group C (n = 10) with severe malnutrition. Plasma levels of total FA, saturated FA, linoleic acid, and omega 6 greater than 18C and omega 3 greater than 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were lower in cirrhotics than in controls. Linoleic:arachidonic ratio was increased and delta 5-desaturation precursors:products ratio did not change, suggesting a reduction in delta 6-desaturase and/or C18-C20 elongase activities. In addition, a stepwise fall in plasma levels of all but saturated FA was found as the nutritional status worsened, suggesting that, in cirrhosis, impairment in PUFA biosynthesis is related to the severity of associated malnutrition. Since PUFA have important biological functions as components of cell membranes and precursors of eicosanoids, the results reported here may open new perspectives in the understanding of the cirrhosis-malnutrition relationship.\r"

Our purpose was to determine whether DAO activity in the intestinal mucosa is diminished in patients with Crohn's disease and correlates with the severity of histological changes. Mucosal DAO activity was determined in 42 tissue specimens from patients with Crohn's enteritis (n = 15), Crohn's colitis (n = 9), and ulcerative colitis (n = 11), and from patients with no intestinal disease (n = 7). DAO activity was estimated by the metabolism of [14C]putrescine. Histologic changes were graded on a scale of 0-4. Normal histology was graded as zero, mild edema, and inflammation in the lamina propria as one, crypt abscess formation and inflammation as two, more severe inflammation plus or minus granulomata as three, and most severe inflammation with active ulceration as four. Tissue DAO activity was significantly less in patients with ileitis (4.8 +/- 3.6) compared with those with Crohn's colitis (15.0 +/- 11.6), ulcerative colitis (16.8 +/- 19.7), and normal intestine (17.6 +/- 14.3 U/mg protein/h, p less than 0.05). Intestinal DAO activity showed a positive correlation with the histologic scores. Recurrence of Crohn's disease developed postoperatively in two patients with low tissue DAO activity (1.4 and 2.9 U/mg protein/h). Intestinal DAO activity is diminished in patients with Crohn's ileitis and correlates with the severity of histologic changes. Tissue DAO activity might prove useful in predicting the risk of recurrence or anastomotic complications after resection for Crohn's disease.\r"

Peritoneal fluid volume was also assessed. IgA levels were decreased in infertile patients with endometriosis. IgG, C3, and C4 levels were also decreased in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in these patients. The volume of peritoneal fluid was increased in these patients and a significant number of these had low C4 levels. The immunodiffusion studies identified antiendometrial antibodies in the serum and peritoneal fluid in infertile patients with endometriosis. This study has shown that the immune system is altered in infertile patients with endometriosis.\r"

This aspect was examined in a murine model. Mice given peritoneal photodynamic therapy had markedly decreased contact hypersensitivity responsiveness, not observed with cutaneous photodynamic therapy. The immunosuppression was systemic, because contact hypersensitivity was depressed at distal, unirradiated sites. Photodynamic therapy induced adoptively transferable cells that inhibited contact hypersensitivity responses in naive mice. The immunosuppression was reversible, but persisted for 3 weeks after photodynamic therapy. An acute-phase response characterized by leukocytosis and elevated serum amyloid P levels was observed in mice given photodynamic therapy but not in mice treated with either laser or dye alone. These data suggest a link between the acute-phase response and immunosuppression. Thus, although photodynamic therapy shows promise in cancer treatment, the induction of decreased systemic immunoresponsiveness is an important observation with potentially detrimental consequences.\r"

The role that growth hormone (GH), growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF), and insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) play in these processes has been investigated using transgenic mice chronically expressing these hormones. The glomeruli were enlarged in all 3 strains of mice. Mesangial proliferation followed by progressive glomerulosclerosis was observed in the GH and GHRF animals only. In the IGF-1 mice the large glomeruli remained morphologically normal except for the enlargement. These data suggest that the glomerulosclerosis was due, in part, to disordered mesangial cell growth in response to circulating GH. The mesangial lesions in mice with chronically high plasma GH levels mimicked those in human diabetes mellitus. These models provide a means to study the hormonal regulation of glomerular growth and the role that specific hormones might play in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis.\r"

Similar differences may occur in a corresponding primate model, the cotton-top tamarin (CTT), Saguinus oedipus, a New World monkey which suffers from spontaneous chronic colitis and colon cancer. Lectin reagents were used to characterize and compare colonic cell surface, cytoplasmic, and secretory glycoconjugates of 9 clinically healthy cotton-top tamarins, 7 colitis-susceptible, cancer-resistant tamarins (Callithrix jacchus, Saguinus fuscicollis), and 8 colitis and cancer-resistant primates (Aotus trivirgatus, Saimiri sciureus, Macaca fascicularis, and Macaca mulatta). Paraffin-embedded colonic sections were labeled with ten different biotinylated lectins and visualized by the avidin-biotin peroxidase (ABC) method. Significant differences were demonstrated in the pattern of lectin staining between the colitis-resistant and colitis-prone groups of primates. The differences were noted with Griffonia simplicifolia-I (GS-I), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), peanut agglutinin (PNA) before and after neuraminidase, Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I), soybean agglutinin (SBA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and succinylated WGA (S-WGA). Significant differences between the CTT and phylogenetically related colitis-prone but cancer-resistant tamarins were demonstrated with SBA, UEA-I, and PNA after desialylation with neuraminidase. These results suggest that differences in colonic cellular glycoconjugates between colitis- and cancer-susceptible species versus colitis-susceptible, cancer-resistant species may be associated with risk of cancer.\r"

In this study they determined the usefulness of cytochemical features in inflamed epithelium as indicators for malignant change. They compared the lectin staining pattern in inflamed mucosa and adjacent mucosa with colonic carcinoma from 8 CTTs with that of 9 clinically healthy CTTs with no histologic evidence of colitis. Deparaffinized sections were labeled with ten biotinylated lectins and stained by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. Numerous significant differences were demonstrated in the lectin staining pattern between normal epithelium and colonic carcinoma; fewer between normal and chronic inflamed epithelium. However, between chronic inflamed epithelium and colonic carcinoma significant staining differences were observed with only two lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I). These findings suggest that there is a progression in alteration of lectin staining pattern from normal epithelium, via chronic colitis, to colonic carcinoma. Furthermore, the differences between chronic colitis and colonic carcinoma are expressed only with those lectins that are associated with malignant transformation of human colonic epithelium.\r"

This study presents data that show a diminished response of two human lymphoma cell lines to physiologic regulation by TGF-beta. Cell line L-428 was derived from the malignant pleural effusion of a patient with far advanced nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease and has been shown to have clonal gene rearrangements characteristic of both B and T lymphocytes. Cell line Mac-1 was derived from the blood of a patient with clinically indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Both cell lines express the Hodgkin's disease associated antigen, Ki-1. These Ki-1 positive lymphomas are shown to secrete TGF-beta into serum-free culture media. The addition of picogram quantities of exogenous TGF-beta to cell cultures of indolent Ki-1 lymphoma (Mac-1) suppresses IL-2-dependent mitosis; however, the suppression is less than 45%. This suppression correlates with a decrease in the number of IL-2 receptors. No inhibition of Ki-1 positive Hodgkin's cells (L-428) was observed, and proliferation dependent on polyclonal IL-2 was either not affected or was slightly potentiated by TGF-beta. Receptor analysis indicates the absence of IL-2 and TGF-beta receptors on L-428 cells. Thus, these Ki-1 lymphomas derived from activated lymphocytes appear to secrete TGF-beta activity but continue to proliferate because of defective suppression of IL-2 (and related lymphokine)-dependent DNA synthesis.\r"

Of the six patients treated conservatively with elastic bandages and rest, only one had regained normal function, whereas the others showed minimal or no improvement.

This resulted in a significant decrease in IOP along with decreases in arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure. In study II, 30 patients, classified randomly into two equal groups, received either normal saline (3 ml) or NTG solution (2 mg/3 ml) intranasally, in a double-blind manner, 2 minutes before anesthetic induction with thiopental followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). In patients given saline, IOP increased significantly above the preinduction levels after succinylcholine. Tracheal intubation increased it further. In the NTG group, increases in IOP after succinylcholine and after tracheal intubation were significantly less than in the control (saline) group. It is concluded that intranasal administration of NTG decreases IOP in anesthetized patients and, when employed as pretreatment, allows the use of succinylcholine to facilitate tracheal intubation without an increase in IOP above preinduction levels.\r"

Fetal/maternal plasma ratios were lower for alfentanil, the more highly protein-bound drug (fetal/maternal ratio 0.20 at birth versus 0.46 for meperidine). However, elimination of alfentanil was delayed in the neonate. Indeed, plasma concentrations of alfentanil increased during the first 2 postnatal hours, indicating a compartmental shift from tissues to circulation in the neonate. As regards respiratory depression, six of ten narcotic-treated monkeys had suboptimal (less than 60 breath/min) respiratory rates at birth. Respiratory rate was negatively correlated with cord vein normeperidine and meperidine levels; the strongest correlation was with normeperidine (r = -0.84, P less than 0.01). Neonatal normeperidine elimination in the postnatal period was prolonged, as has also been observed in humans. These studies serve as a basis for comparing the neonatal neurobehavioral effects of the two analgesics and support the use of the rhesus monkey as an animal model to further understanding of the effects of narcotic analgesics on neonatal respiration.\r"

These drugs were pirenzepine, an anti-muscarinic (anti-MI) receptor antagonist, and rosaprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin. Further, the results obtained by these schedules of treatment were compared with those achieved by the previously described polyantihistaminic treatment (ie, the association of anti-H1 plus anti-H2 receptor blockers). The present investigation suggests that the cytoprotective drugs are more effective than the antisecretive ones (ie, the anti-H2). Recently, anti-H2 drugs and ketotifen were shown to be in vitro inhibitors of the immune response and cromolyn was demonstrated capable of exerting an enhancing effect on T cell proliferation. In the present study we tested the effect of pirenzepine on several immunologic parameters, such as lymphocyte proliferation (through different activation pathways) and lymphokine (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) production. Since we found that pirenzepine does not affect the immune response and in consideration of its clinical efficacy, we consider this cytoprotective drug a valuable tool in the treatment of adverse reactions to foods.\r"

Animals were instrumented to sample arterial blood, mixed venous blood, and CSF through a cisternal catheter. Following six minutes of ventricular fibrillation, manual CPR efforts were begun and continued for 30 minutes of cardiac arrest. Arterial, mixed venous, and CS fluids were sampled at baseline, six, 12, 18, 24, 27, and 30 minutes. Ten experimental dogs received sodium bicarbonate (2 mEq/kg) at 20 minutes of cardiac arrest, while ten animals in the control group received no alkali treatment. The experimental group showed a significantly higher arterial (7.79 +/- 0.20 vs 7.46 +/- 0.16 at 30 minutes) and venous pH (7.34 +/- 0.12 vs 7.19 +/- 0.10 at 24 minutes) following bicarbonate administration.

CSF analysis showed a gradually worsening acidosis. However, CSF pH (7.12 +/- 0.14 vs 7.16 +/- 0.23 at 30 minutes) and pCO2 were not significantly changed by the administration of bicarbonate.\r"

To eliminate the influence of variable pCO2 on serum pH, all blood gas values were adjusted to a pCO2 of 40 mm Hg. Adjusted pH fell a mean of 0.09 U (SEM +/- 0.03, P = .02) with five minutes of CC-CPR and then 0.05 U (SEM +/- 0.02, P = .05) with five minutes of OC-CPR. The decline in adjusted pH during CC-CPR was statistically comparable to the decline that occurred during OC-CPR. The development of acidosis as measured by blood gases does not appear to be significantly different for patients undergoing five minutes of CC-CPR versus five minutes of OC-CPR when OC-CPR follows CC-CPR.\r"

We present 4 patients who started to have focal myoclonus in childhood. All had focal motor seizures as well, and one had recurrent focal motor status epilepticus. All 4 had a mild progressive hemiparesis. Electrographic investigations showed focal epileptic discharges in the contralateral rolandic areas. Radiological studies were unrevealing, but magnetic resonance showed rolandic lesions in 3 patients. At surgery, abnormally wide gyri were found in the distribution demonstrated by magnetic resonance. The pathological substrate was focal cortical dysplasia. All patients have improved considerably following surgery. These findings suggest that focal myoclonus may be due to a rolandic neuronal migration disorder. Visualization of these lesions by magnetic resonance permits development of a surgical strategy leading to optimal treatment of these medically intractable epileptic disorders.\r"

As controls, recombinant human interferon gamma (rhIFN) and interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) were tested, as well as T-cell supernatants, antigalactocerebroside serum, and normal culture medium. It was found that rhTNF induced delayed-onset (18-24 hr) oligodendrocyte necrosis and a type of myelin dilatation peculiar to this system. Some nerve fibers progressed to demyelination by 72 hours. The myelin dilatation was not reversible by return to normal feeding solution for 3 days. In contrast, rhIFN, rhIL-2, T-cell supernatants, and normal medium had little or no effect on cultures. This mechanism differs from other immune-mediated mechanisms in that it appears that a physiological (not structural) demyelination occurs initially without overt destruction of the myelin sheath. These observations are relevant to the evolution of the multiple sclerosis plaque: dysfunction of ionic channels might contribute to the eventual demise of oligodendrocytes and axons in the longstanding lesion.\r"

By serial angiography, the tPA-treated group demonstrated rapid angiographic reperfusion of the occluded vascular territory in 7 of 8 animals, whereas none of 6 saline controls did. None of the animals in either group developed macroscopic cerebral hemorrhage. Both groups showed cerebral infarction, predominantly in the territory of the occluded vessel; the extent of infarction did not differ between tPA-treated animals and controls. Early tPA therapy can allow reperfusion of occluded cerebral arteries safely and effectively in a rabbit cerebral embolization model.\r"

Results indicated that canine serum PCB levels in contaminated areas (median = 3.0 ppb) tend to be greater than those in uncontaminated areas (median = 1.7 ppb [p = .06, Mann-Whitney U test]).

For asymptomatic homosexuals, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC), and patients with fully established AIDS, clinical status correlated linearly with both T4+ cell number and T4+ cell-derived (antigen-stimulated) IFN-gamma secretion. For asymptomatic homosexuals, abnormalities in T4+ cell number and IFN-gamma generation were similar irrespective of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. For patients with ARC, those with lymphadenopathy (LA) alone or LA plus zoster or thrombocytopenia displayed T4+ cell defects similar to those observed in asymptomatic homosexuals. Patients with ARC with LA plus constitutional symptoms and/or oral thrush, however, had fewer T4+ cells, were strikingly more deficient in IFN-gamma production, and closely resembled those with AIDS. Among patients with AIDS, certain individuals with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) alone were sufficiently less cytopenic and less immunodeficient than patients with opportunistic infections (Ols) to suggest that the immune impairment that predisposes to KS may differ. At the time patients with KS developed Ols, however, T4+ cell number and IFN-gamma-generating capacity had declined to the remarkably low levels observed in virtually all patients with Ols alone.\r"

We studied this question in a patient population in which the diagnosis was definitively made via pulmonary arteriography. Sixty-four patients met all study criteria. In these patients, the A-a gradient ranged from 11.6 to 83.9 mm Hg (mean, 41.8 mm Hg). In three patients, the A-a gradient was normal for age. We conclude that a normal A-a oxygen gradient does not exclude the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, and should not preclude further diagnostic procedures if there is a high index of suspicion.\r"

The 37-week course of therapy was completed by 109 patients. While marked improvement was seen in all 3 treatment groups, the only statistically significant differences between SSZ or GST and PBO were in a decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased grip strength in the right hand. GST is known to be superior to PBO, and the response of the GST-treated group was similar to that seen in other trials. The response of the PBO group, however, was much greater than in other placebo groups we have studied. SSZ was similar in efficacy to injectable gold, but was better tolerated. Because of adverse drug reactions (most commonly, rash, stomatitis, and proteinuria), 41% of patients were withdrawn from the GST treatment. Untoward drug effects (most frequently, rash and gastrointestinal distress) caused 16% of patients to be withdrawn from SSZ therapy.\r"

Blocking of HIV-1 infectivity can be achieved with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to some, but not all epitopes of this antigen. We demonstrate here, by inhibition of virus infection, blocking of syncytium formation and inhibition of pseudotype infection with a panel of CD4 MAbs, that HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates share the same cellular receptor, the CD4 glycoprotein. It is also shown that very similar epitopes of this molecule are involved in virus binding. We infer from these data that the binding sites on these viruses are highly conserved regions, and may therefore make good targets for potential vaccines. In addition, we show that cell surface expression of CD4 is similarly modulated after infection of cell lines by all the viruses.\r"

To determine whether HIV envelope antigens are recognized by human cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), we assessed class I MHC-restricted, HIV envelope antigen-specific cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-infected individuals, following in vitro stimulation. The target cells were human skin fibroblasts of known tissue type, infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses, either containing or lacking the whole HIV envelope gene. Ten out of 17 (59%) asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals demonstrated HIV envelope antigen-specific cytotoxicity at levels that were above those seen in HIV-seronegative controls. MHC restriction of cytotoxicity was evident in that 13 out of 19 (68%) of the targets matched for the tissue type of the donor at one or more class I MHC loci were lysed, but only two out of 18 (11%) mismatched targets (P = 0.0004). Both partial purification of effector cells and evidence of MHC restriction indicated that T-lymphocytes were responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. HIV envelope antigen-specific CTL can be detected following in vitro stimulation of the PBMC in many asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals. HIV envelope antigens are recognized by human CTL and are, therefore, potentially relevant immunogens for induction of HIV-specific CTL responses.\r"

The purified antibodies to peptide A15 reacted specifically with the peptide in EIA, but not in whole virus EIA. These antibodies were immunoreactive with the corresponding peptide-albumin conjugates in immunoblotting but not with gp41 molecules.

The sera were screened for antibodies by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using purified simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolated from rhesus macaque monkeys (SIVmac) and then confirmed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays for antibodies to SIV, HIV-2, and HIV-1. Five of the serum samples were repeatedly reactive by all assays to both SIV and HIV-2. None were positive for antibodies to HIV-1 by immunofluorescence, immunoblot or radio-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, with the exception of one HIV-2-seropositive samples which reacted with HIV-1 glycoproteins by RIPA. Thus, in 1980, at least 1.4% (six out of 440) of a random sample of people in rural Guinea Bissau had been exposed to a virus highly related to HIV-2 and SIV. One of these subjects may have been dually infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2.\r"

Results showed significant reductions in performance in the two AIDS groups, with impairment being most prominent in tests that assessed motor speed and fine control, concentration, problem solving and visuospatial performance.

The HIV isolation rates were equally high in patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS. Although the HIV recovery rate was low in patients with normal immunological parameters it was not correlated with the degree of severity of the immunodeficiency in the other patients. Furthermore, the recovery rates were not significantly correlated to the duration of the infection. HIV was recovered as often from patients with neurological symptoms as from patients without such symptoms. These findings suggest that in the majority of patients there is central nervous system (CNS) involvement early in the course of HIV infection and that HIV replication in the CNS may occur in the absence of a pronounced systemic cellular immunodeficiency and frequently without causing overt neurological symptoms.\r"

Mean survival during the first year was calculated for patients with inferior and with anterior infarction and adjusted for impaired quality of life in cases where there were symptoms or hospital admission. In patients with inferior infarction mean survival was 337 days (out of a total follow up of 365 days) for patients allocated to thrombolytic treatment and 327 days for controls. Quality adjusted survival was seven days longer in the thrombolysis group (307 vs 300 days in controls).

Before exercise plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was higher in the patient groups than in a group of 10 healthy volunteers. For those who were normolipidaemic plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was greater in patients with angina pectoris who had had a myocardial infarction. The concentration of antigenic tissue-type plasminogen activator was similar in all the patients with coronary artery disease and higher than in the control group. After the exercise test fibrinolytic capacity was lower in the patients with angina pectoris and a previous history of myocardial infarction. After exercise both the released immunological tissue-type plasminogen activator and fibrinolytic capacity were lower in the hyperlipidaemic patients than in the normolipidaemic patients. The concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor was also higher in the hyperlipidaemic patients. Patients with hyperlipidaemia IV had the highest plasminogen activator inhibitor activity. The increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor activity found in the patients was partially inhibited by antiserum against plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in vitro. The formation of a complex of about 115,000 daltons between plasminogen activator inhibitor and purified tissue-type plasminogen activator was detected by a zymographic fibrin technique. These findings show that in patients with coronary artery disease fibrinolytic activity is impaired by an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor. Impaired fibrinolysis may be related to the clinical evolution of coronary artery disease in these patients.\r"

Systemic or intravesical chemotherapy was given to 28 patients in whom carcinoma in situ was associated with G1 or G2 exophytic superficial tumour: there was only one cancer death in 3 years. Fifteen patients with G3 carcinoma in situ associated with a G3 or invasive exophytic tumour were treated with radiotherapy: 9 responded but 4 of the 6 with radio-insensitive tumours died of cancer within 3 years. Eight patients with secondary carcinoma in situ were managed by transurethral resection alone: in 6 there was spontaneous regression and 2 developed muscle invasion within 1 year. These results compare well with those of immunotherapy or early radical surgery and suggest that chemotherapy should be given a trial in patients with carcinoma in situ.\r"

  ".W": "Of 238 infertile males seen over a 47-month period, 47 (20%) had a varicocele. Of these 51% had an abnormal sperm count (21% were azoospermic and 30% oligozoospermic) and 60% had less than a third of sperms motile; 23 patients were subjected to gonadotrophin assays. Serum follicle stimulating hormone and leutinising hormone levels were elevated in 48% and 70% of patients respectively. Serum prolactin assayed in 19 patients was raised in 10% and serum testosterone estimated in 16 patients was low in 6%. Twenty-five patients (53%) were advised to undergo surgery but only 10 agreed. Of these, 1 showed a dramatic improvement in his spermiogram and a pregnancy ensued. The sperm count and motility of 2 others improved after treatment with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and 1 after testosterone. Medical treatment improved the count and motility in 7 of 8 patients in whom surgery was not suggested as primary treatment because of abnormal hormonal results. This study has shown that infertile patients with varicocele are a heterogeneous group and that improvement in spermiograms can best be achieved by selective treatment; this may be surgery, surgery followed by medical treatment, or medical treatment alone.\r"

The subjects were randomised to receive either BRL 26830A, 200 mg daily for two weeks then 400 mg daily, or placebo for 18 weeks, and all were instructed to follow a 3.35 MJ diet that was low in fat and high in fibre. Weight loss was 15.4 (SD 6.6) kg in subjects given BRL 26830A compared with 10.0 (5.9) kg in those given placebo (p = 0.02). The relative weight loss was 0.93 (0.39%) a week with BRL 26830A and 0.61 (0.38)% with placebo (p = 0.02). Urinary excretion of nitrogen was similar in both groups, whereas measurements of skinfold thickness indicated a 4.1 kg difference in the amount of fat lost, suggesting that weight loss with BRL 26830A was mainly from adipose and not lean tissue. BRL 26830A had no effect on resting pulse rate or pressor effects on either diastolic or systolic blood pressure. No significant differences were found between the two groups in serum cholesterol concentration, percentage of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin, the ratio of glucose to insulin, serum concentrations of triiodothyronine and thyroxine, and creatinine clearance. Short term administration of BRL 26830A to six subjects who had taken the drug for 18 weeks showed that the expenditure of energy increased by 11.6% during the second hour after administration, which suggests that BRL 26830A may enhance weight loss thermogenically. BRL 26830A may be a useful drug in the treatment of obesity.\r"

  ".U": "88252659\r", 
  ".W": "Data obtained from follow up of the 1971 census sample in the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys longitudinal study of England and Wales were used to look at women's mortality differentials at ages 15-59. Women were grouped by combining information on marital state, own occupation, husband's occupation (if married), economic activity, and indicators of household wealth (housing tenure and access to a car). Large groups were found with considerable differences in mortality. High mortality was associated with working in manual occupations and living in rented housing with no car in the household. In contrast, low mortality was associated with non-manual occupations and living in owner occupied housing with a car. Among married housewives and single women these extreme groups contributed 44% of expected deaths, the disadvantaged group experiencing death rates two and a half times that of the advantaged group. Smaller differences were found among married women with an occupational class. These findings are further evidence of the \"health divide\" in England and Wales and show that accurately to reflect the relation between a woman's life circumstances and mortality it is necessary to utilise other measures than those based solely on occupation.\r"

  ".U": "88252660\r", 
  ".W": "The mortality from measles was studied in an urban area of Guinea-Bissau one year before and five years after the introduction of a vaccination programme. The years after the introduction of immunisation saw a decline in mortality among unvaccinated children with measles. This decline occurred despite a lower age at infection and an increasing prevalence of malnourished children. State of nutrition (weight for age) did not affect the outcome of measles infection. The incidence of isolated cases, however, increased in the period after the introduction of measles vaccination. As mortality was lower among these cases, diminished clustering explained some of the reduction in mortality. Comparison between the urban district and a rural area inhabited by the same ethnic group showed a lower age at infection, less clustering of cases, and lower case fatality ratios in the urban area. Endemic transmission of measles in urban districts leads to less clustering of cases, which may help explain the usually lower case fatality ratios in these areas. As measles vaccination increases herd immunity and diminishes clustering of cases, it may reduce mortality even among unvaccinated children who contract the disease.\r"

Twenty subjects had a clear history of depression; three of these required additional treatment and five might have coped without continued drug treatment. Twelve of the remainder had started treatment with tricyclic antidepressants as hypnotics and 11 as a trial because of suspected depression. They had continued taking the drugs over a long period. Regular review of both the adequacy of and the necessity for continued treatment with tricyclic antidepressants in the elderly is recommended.\r"

Searching for missing clinical data and the time spent on non-medical clerical tasks took up nearly half of the consultant's sessions. This seemed to be due to insufficient clerical and secretarial staff. Because low salaries are offered to such staff vast sums of money are being paid to agencies who are providing an appreciable number (40%) of the secretarial staff in our hospitals. Urgent action from the government is needed to remedy this and thus make substantial reductions in outpatient waiting lists nationally. It would greatly improve morale in this important sector of the health service without increasing total costs.\r"

  ".W": "The end tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) was measured during treadmill exercise in 30 normal controls and 113 patients referred for assessment of chest pain. Among the 92 patients without significant ST depression hypocapnia occurred more often in those reporting \"typical\" than \"atypical\" chest pain (17 of 22 patients compared with 29 of 70; p less than 0.01). Hypocapnia was uncommon in patients with significant ST depression whether reporting typical or atypical chest pain (one of 10 patients and two of 11, respectively). Hypocapnia at rest (PCO2 less than 4 kPa) occurred in 16 (14%) patients but in only one control. Hypocapnia occurred during or after exercise in only one control and three of the 21 patients with significant ST depression on exercise (group 1). The remaining 92 patients were divided into those with a history suggestive of hyperventilation (group 2; n = 30) and those without (group 3; n = 62). Hypocapnia developed significantly more often in both these groups (21 and 25 patients respectively) than in controls or patients with significant ST depression. An abnormal response of the PCO2 to exercise provided objective data to support a clinical suspicion of chest pain induced by hyperventilation in 24 cases, suggested a cause for equivocal ST depression other than coronary stenosis in five patients, and led to the diagnosis of previously unsuspected respiratory disease in 14 patients. Measurement of end tidal PCO2 gives additional valuable diagnostic information during the conventional treadmill exercise test in patients with both typical and atypical chest pain.\r"

All variables previously shown to be associated with a decrease or increase in the incidence of melanoma were considered for inclusion in a single conditional logistic regression model of the incidence of melanoma in the randomly chosen subset of 400 case-control pairs. Five of these variables--number of raised naevi on the arms, arrival in Australia before 10 years of age, history of non-melanocytic skin cancer, time spent outdoors in summer from the age of 10 to 24, and family history of melanoma--provided good discrimination between patients and controls in this sample and the 111 other case-control pairs. Among the 222 subjects in these other case-control pairs a group defined as being at high risk of melanoma by a risk score derived from these five variables contained 60 (54%) of the patients with melanoma but only 18 (16%) of the controls. These data suggest that in Western Australia more than half of all new patients with melanoma arise in an identifiable subpopulation constituting less than one fifth of the whole population. Identifying this subpopulation and screening it regularly for cutaneous malignant melanoma could be cost effective in reducing mortality from this disease.\r"

Trends in deaths from other causes may identify conditions that have not been recognised to be associated with HIV infection. Mortality statistics with reference to AIDS in England and Wales were completed from death certificates. Increases in deaths from selected causes likely to be associated with AIDS or HIV infection suggested that in some patients with HIV infection, AIDS was not stated on the death certificate or subsequently notified by the doctor who signed the certificate. From calculations of excess deaths between the beginning of 1985 and the end of April 1987, compared with 1984 at least 495 deaths possibly associated with HIV infection were estimated to have occurred among men aged 15-54 during that period. In 261 AIDS or HIV infection was stated on the original or amended death entry as the cause of death, and of these 198 were included in the estimated number of excess deaths. Accurate notification of the underlying cause of death and associated diseases is required for the precise monitoring of trends in mortality from AIDS and possible identification of unrecognised conditions associated with HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "The use of measurements of antibody to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor and HLA-DR3 phenotype for predicting relapse of hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease receiving medical treatment is controversial. Fifty eight new patients with Graves' disease were followed up prospectively for up to 96 months after treatment with antithyroid drugs for 12 months. The presence of antibody to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor before the start of treatment, measured as immunoglobulins inhibiting binding of thyroid stimulating hormone, was not associated with relapse. Patients who remained positive for antibodies after treatment tended to relapse within six months, but no relation with long term relapse was found. HLA-Cw7 but not HLA-DR3 was significantly associated with relapse. The presence of HLA-DR4 was significantly associated with remission and with absence of antibodies to thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. HLA-DR4 may therefore protect against relapse of thyrotoxicosis by immunomodulation triggered by antithyroid drugs, which results in the synthesis of antibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor being inhibited.\r"

The association between proteinuria and shorter survival was statistically significant for patients with gut tumours, lung tumours, and tumours at other sites analysed as a group.

The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence was 41% (343/833); rates were lower in nulliparous and postmenopausal women (30/181 (17%) and 120/344 (35%) respectively) than parous and premenopausal women (313/652 (48%) and 225/479 (47%) respectively). Incontinence was significantly associated with perineal suturing after childbirth, being present in 201 of 376 (53%) women with sutures compared with 113 of 270 (42%) without. Of the 166 women with a history of minor gynaecological surgery, 100 had symptoms of incontinence, compared with 263 of the 657 (37%) without such a history. Incontinence was not related to type of delivery, and postnatal exercises for the pelvic floor were not beneficial. Inappropriate leakage of urine is perceived by many women as common and therefore not serious; thus it is often not reported to the doctor. Nevertheless, the 6% of women who always require protection against leakage could be helped by treatment.\r"

In contrast, just over a third of hospitals allowed visiting for more than five hours a day. There was no relation between visiting times and type of hospital, but a striking regional variation in visiting hours was found, with more liberal visiting in south east England and restricted visiting in northern England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\r"

  ".W": "One thousand consecutive deaths from injury in 11 coroner's districts in England and Wales were reviewed by four independent assessors, who studied necropsy reports to identify deaths in hospital that might have been preventable. Of 514 patients admitted to hospital alive, 102 deaths (20%) were judged by all four assessors to have been potentially preventable. When those cases in which three out of four assessors considered that the death was preventable were added the total rose to 170 (33%). Nearly two thirds of all non-central nervous system deaths were judged to have been preventable. The median age of the 170 patients whose deaths were preventable was 41, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 29. Further analysis suggested that the preventable deaths were principally the result of failure to stop bleeding and prevent hypoxia and the absence of, or delay in, surgical treatment. The results closely parallel those from similar studies from the United States and suggest that there are serious deficiencies in the services for managing severe injury in England and Wales. Debate is needed now on how to correct these deficiencies. In particular, the place of trauma centres must be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Brain function was measured in 5 patients with clinically diagnosed Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome using positron emission tomography and tracers of dopamine metabolism, blood flow and oxygen metabolism. A global decrease in blood flow and oxygen utilization compared with normal values was found but the decrease was more marked in the frontal regions. The degree of impairment in oxygen utilization in the frontal region paralleled roughly the duration of the disease. Blood flow was impaired to a greater extent than oxygen utilization, resulting in raised oxygen extraction. This can partially be explained by a lower pCO2 in the patients. Alternatively it may imply involvement of brain vasculature in the pathophysiology of the disease in addition to neuronal degeneration. Striatal dopamine formation and storage, as indicated by L-(18F)fluorodopa uptake, was significantly decreased compared with control values. The severity of this decrease paralleled the degree of reduction in frontal cerebral blood flow. The results suggest that the impairment of cerebral function in Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome is determined to a large extent by brainstem pathology.\r"

  ".U": "88253111\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-one patients with refractory germ cell tumors were treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing etoposide (VP-16) (V) 75 mg/m2/day (days 1 to 5), ifosfamide (I) 3 g/m2/day (days 1 and 2) with a 3.6 g/m2 continuous infusion of mesna (days 1 and 2), and high-dose cisplatin (hP) 40 mg/m2/day (days 1 to 5). The regimen is referred to as VIhP. Nineteen patients were evaluable for response. Five patients (26%) achieved a complete remission (CR) with chemotherapy alone, and three patients (16%) were in CR after resection of a residual nonactive tumoral mass (e.g., necrosis and/or fibrosis and/or mature teratoma). Thus, a CR rate of 42% was achieved with the entire treatment. One additional patient achieved a CR after resection of active, bulky disease. Among the responders, five patients (26%) are still alive and disease-free at 6, 7, 9, 10, and 18 months after the initiation of the chemotherapy. However, toxicity was heavy in this protocol. Severe myelosuppression was observed with 10 patients developing aplasia and six patients documented sepsis. Reversible Grade 1-2 renal toxicity occurred in 14 patients, and Grade 2-3 peripheral neurotoxicity occurred in six patients. No hemorrhagic cystitis was encountered. We conclude that a VIhP regimen seems to play an active role in refractory germ cell tumors although the presence of high-dose cisplatin in this regimen does not appear to improve the response rate compared to that of a conventional dose. Toxicity, which seems to be enhanced, is currently under detailed study. However, the contribution of VIhP as a first-line treatment in poor prognosis, advanced germ cell tumors warrants further study.\r"

Because the intent was to study the outcome by treatment after evaluation of first-line chemotherapy, patients were evaluable only if the response was assessed by a second-look operation or if measurable disease progression was documented. One hundred fifty-eight patients (81%) were evaluable for response. Forty-five (28%) achieved pathologically confirmed complete remissions (pCR), and 24 of these patients received whole-abdominal radiation (WAR) for consolidation of response. Five patients with complete remission after WAR relapsed, as did nine of the 21 with complete remission who had not undergone WAR. The 3-year time to progression percentage (TTP +/- SE) from second-look operation was 70% +/- 7% for all patients who achieved pCR, 83% +/- 8% for those who received WAR, and 49% +/- 15% for those who did not receive WAR (this was not a randomized comparison). The 3-year TTP percentage for the 49 partial responders was 21% +/- 6%, identical for the 19 who had WAR and the 30 who had no radiation therapy. Additional or alternative methods for consolidation of pCR are needed since patients continue to relapse despite optimal initial response to therapy.\r"

Staging and treatment policies were consistent throughout this period, and have enabled the influence of histologic classification on treatment results to be evaluated. Large cell nonkeratinizing carcinoma (LCNK) was the most common type, 69%; followed by keratinizing (KSCC), 13%; and adenocarcinoma, 6.6%. Other varieties included adenosquamous, 3.6%; small cell undifferentiated carcinoma, 2.7%; papillary squamous, 1.6%; and glassy cell, 1.4%. Overall survivals by stage were similar to those reported from other centers. When examined by histologic type, the 5-year survival rates ranged from 64% for adenosquamous to 13% for small cell. The most common varieties, LCNK and KSCC, had survival rates of 61% and 40% (P = 0.008). Considering both stage and histologic type, the differences between LCNK and KSCC persisted and were significant for Stage IIB (P = 0.023). Of particular interest are the poor results in small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, except in the earliest stages, and the good results for adenosquamous carcinoma. The patterns of failure by histologic type showed that local failures were higher in cases of KSCC than in LCNK, indicating a probable difference in radiosensitivity. Distant spread was similar for both types. Both small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma showed high rates of distant spread and local failure except in the early stages. Considering survival and failure rates, three prognostic groups could be identified. In descending order of curability these were: 1) LCNK and adenosquamous carcinoma; 2) KSCC, papillary squamous carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma; and 3) small cell carcinoma and glassy cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "From February 1985 until January 1987, 108 consecutive patients with pain due to advanced cancer requiring parenteral narcotics were treated with a subcutaneous infusion of morphine (62 patients) or hydromorphone (46 patients). Mean maximal daily dose of morphine and hydromorphone was 305 mg (range, 80-3000 mg) and 310 mg (range, 40-4024 mg), respectively. The infusion was maintained for a mean of 31 +/- 16 days (range, 2-156). Seventy patients were treated with a portable pump. Of these patients, 33 (45%) were discharge home for a mean of 29 +/- 20 days. Eighty-six of one hundred eight (86/108, 80%) patients experienced adequate pain control (less than two extra doses of analgesics per day). The duration of the site of the infusion was 7 days (range, 2-31). The mean daily increase in those was 2.4 +/- 1.6% of the initial dose (only 15% of patients needed an increase more than or equal to 5% per day). Systemic toxicity consisted of respiratory depression in two patients, severe sedation in six, and confusion in three; all patients improved upon reduction of the daily dose of narcotics. Local toxicity consisted in infection in two patients, bleeding in one, and chemical irritation in six. Cost analysis shows that subcutaneous infusion reduced costs by either allowing home discharges, or replacing intravenous infusion. The authors conclude that this method is safe and effective in patients admitted and at home, and should be considered the first choice when parenteral analgesia is required.\r"

Preoperative plasma levels of insulin and growth hormone (GH) were markedly elevated and there was mild hyperprolactinemia. Laboratory tests suggested hyperparathyroidism. Partial pancreatectomy was performed and two tumors were found. Morphologic examination revealed two well-differentiated pancreatic endocrine neoplasms with distinct histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features. Immunoreactivity for insulin was present in the larger tumor; the smaller tumor contained glucagon, gastrin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. Both neoplasms demonstrated growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) immunopositivity and released GRH in vitro. Subsequent studies confirmed abnormally elevated preoperative plasma levels of GRH. Postoperatively, blood glucose, insulin, GRH, and GH normalized and there was regression of acromegalic features with significant reduction in sellar size. The clinicopathologic findings indicate that, in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I), GRH production by pancreatic tumors can stimulate hypophysial somatotrophs resulting in GH excess and acromegaly due to a reversible pituitary lesion, most likely somatotroph hyperplasia.\r"

A prospective randomized trial was instituted to compare the effect on ventricular function and myocardial metabolism of induction with fentanyl (FEN) or its analogues sufentanil (SUF) or alfentanil (ALF) in 96 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Haemodynamic, metabolic (coronary sinus oxygen and lactate extraction) and gated ventriculographic measurements were made awake pre-induction (PRE), after induction (IND) and after intubation (INT). Induction was performed with FEN 75 micrograms.kg-1, SUF 15 micrograms.kg-1 or ALF 125 micrograms.kg-1 and metocurine. Fentanyl induction was associated with the greatest stability of mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac performance, and systolic function without associated myocardial lactate production. SUF produced the greatest depression of systolic function (p less than 0.05) but without haemodynamic instability or myocardial lactate production in all but one patient. Induction with ALF produced the greatest reduction in MAP (p less than 0.05) associated with the greatest decrease in diastolic compliance (p less than 0.05) and 50 per cent incidence of myocardial lactate production (p less than 0.05) with no significant change in coronary blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption.\r"

In particular, the resistance of physicians to immunization, especially to hepatitis B, needs to be changed. Protection against other blood-borne pathogens for which immunization is not available, such as HIV, may also depend on the willingness of anaesthesia personnel to accept and carry out recommendations for universal blood and body fluid precautions. Regulatory agencies and compensation boards are likely to look closely at adherence to established guidelines when determining benefits for work-related infections. Complaints that the routine use of gloves interferes with anaesthetic practice are frequent but unacceptable in the current climate and it behooves the profession to ensure that compliance with currently accepted infection control guidelines is complete.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of monensin on microtubule-associated translocation of atrial secretory granules in 5-7-day-old cultures of atrial myocytes from adult rats. Atrial granules and microtubules were localized by immunofluorescent microscopy of myocytes double-labeled with primary antibodies against atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) and alpha-tubulin. In control myocytes, fluorescence due to atrial granules was predominantly localized to the perinuclear region containing the Golgi complex. After exposure for 30 minutes to monensin (0.5-5.0 microM), myocytes transiently contained conspicuous linear arrays of atrial granules associated with cytoplasmic microtubules. Thereafter, ANP fluorescence accumulated in subsarcolemmal foci at the cell periphery, while perinuclear ANP fluorescence faded. The monensin-induced redistribution of atrial granules was observable in both serum-containing and serum-free media and was unaffected by reducing external Ca2+ to low values, by inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release with ryanodine, or by both. The redistribution was prevented by pretreatment with nocodazole, which fragmented microtubules and scattered Golgi complexes and the associated atrial granules throughout the cytoplasm. Radioimmunoassay showed that monensin seemingly decreased the rate of ANP secretion into the medium from 0.15 to 0.11 fmol/(hr.myocyte). These results suggest that monensin turns on microtubule-associated translocation of atrial granules from the perinuclear areas to the cell periphery by modifying the interaction between microtubules and atrial granules. Monensin also promotes movement of atrial granules along the microtubules but does not accelerate the release of ANP.\r"

This effect resembled the effects of dibutyryl cyclic GMP and of sodium nitroprusside on cardiac muscle. The action of atriopeptin III, but not of dibutyryl cyclic GMP or sodium nitroprusside, was abolished by mechanically or chemically damaging the endocardial endothelial surface. Thus, the early relaxation of cardiac muscle induced by atrial natriuretic peptide may be mediated through receptors on the endocardial endothelium.\r"

The mechanism of phospholipid degradation in hypoxic myocardium was studied. The highest activity for phospholipase A2 among subcellular fractions was found in microsomal fraction. In hypoxic myocardium, this phospholipase A2 activity markedly increased and had substrate specificity toward phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylcholine was slightly hydrolyzed in control myocardium, but it was markedly hydrolyzed in hypoxic myocardium. Phospholipase C activity was found in cytosol and had a high substrate specificity toward phosphatidylinositol. In hypoxic myocardium, its activity gradually decreased during hypoxic incubation. Prostacyclin biosynthesis was also determined. The synthesis of prostacyclin in hypoxic myocardial microsomes did not increase.

A small but significant increase in left ventricular APir and AP mRNA was also present, probably representing the interventricular septum. Right atrial APir was decreased by 50%, but left atrial APir was not different from normoxic controls. Purification of ventricular tissue extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed primarily the high molecular weight prohormone. The development of right ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular APir content followed a similar time course, each evident at 7 days of hypoxia and reaching a plateau at 14 days. Hypoxia followed by normoxia caused right ventricular APir to fall to control levels within 3 days, despite persistent right ventricular hypertrophy. This data demonstrates that hypoxia can reversibly induce extra-atrial expression of atriopeptin synthesis in the cardiac ventricle.\r"

While total clot lysis was similar when 1 mg/kg rt-PA was infused over 15 (rt-PA15) or 90 (rt-PA90) minutes (47% and 42%, respectively), rate of lysis during infusion was markedly increased with rt-PA15 (56% vs. 27%/hr, p less than 0.001). Corresponding to the increased rate of thrombolysis with rt-PA15, relative PAP decrease was greater at 15 and 30 minutes. At 4 hours, PAP decreased most with rt-PA90. However, two of the six dogs given rt-PA15 had an increase in PAP and lung radioactivity 1 hour after rt-PA. This was associated with dislodgment of a previously trapped clot. These results suggest that rt-PA may be appropriate therapy for pulmonary embolism and support further studies designed to optimize dosing regimes.\r"

These late sequelae can be inhibited by sodium cromoglycate and by corticosteroids but not by bronchodilators. Recognition that allergic and occupational (and likely all forms of) asthma are inflammatory conditions underscores the rationale for the early use of anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies in the management of asthma. Such \"anti-inflammatory\" therapeutic strategies include environmental control, sodium cromoglycate, and both inhaled and oral corticosteroids.\r"

Data have accumulated indicating that a reduction in airway reactivity can decrease asthma morbidity, and many advocate treating asthmatic patients prophylactically to prevent acute exacerbations from developing, rather than responding to them after they have occurred. This approach is particularly effective if it is used when the airways are being exposed to stimuli to which they are sensitive. A number of drugs have been purported to reduce airway reactivity, but the most convincing evidence supports the effects of cromolyn and inhaled and oral steroids. Although each type of drug has its own advantages and disadvantages and different modes of action, the common denominator is believed to be a reduction in the state of airway inflammation.\r"

Pulmonary function testing, symptom-limited exercise tests using arterial catheter lines, and resting ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were obtained in 19 patients (mean FEV1 = 1.07 +/- .50 L). The resting PaCO2 was closely related to the resting hypercapnic response. The highest correlation coefficient was between the PaCO2 and the ventilation at PCO2 = 60 obtained from the resting hypercapnic response (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001). A higher PaCO2 also tended to occur in patients with a lower FEV1 and a lower PaO2. The resting PaCO2 was not correlated significantly with the VT or the VD/VT. The change in the PaCO2 from rest to exercise was not significantly related to any measure of resting hypercapnic or hypoxic response, but rather was most dependent on the ventilatory response to exercise (delta VE/delta VCO2). Patients with a lower FEV1 or smaller decreases in the PaO2 with exercise tended to have larger increases in PaCO2 with exercise. The delta VE/delta VCO2 was higher in those with a high FEV1, a low resting PaCO2, and a low resting SaO2.\r"

In all studies, we used an antiserum against the first 26 N-terminal amino acids of the alpha-chain of porcine inhibin (anti-alpha-inhibin). Plasma immunoreactive inhibin levels were highest in young rats (8-15 days old), then decreased steadily with age. In addition, iv injection of the inhibin-alpha antiserum caused significant (P less than or equal to 0.01 or P less than or equal to 0.05) elevations in plasma FSH levels in male rats aged 10-24 days, whereas no significant (P greater than 0.05) changes occurred in older animals. In the testes, immunoreactive inhibin levels, expressed as femtomoles per mg wet weight, also declined with age. Inhibin immunostaining was most prominent in the Sertoli cells, with the greatest staining in the testes of 8 to 15-day-old rats. These results suggest that endogenous inhibin plays a physiological role in suppressing FSH secretion in infantile male rats, at an age when Sertoli cells contain the largest amount of this protein.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hCG and various pituitary hormones on type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors of purified Leydig cells of hypophysectomized rats were studied. The number of type I IGF receptors of Leydig cells obtained from hypophysectomized rats (18.0 +/- 1.5 fmol/10(6) cells) was lower than that in normal rats (54.6 +/- 5.3 fmol/10(6) cells; P less than 0.05). After a single administration of hCG (10 U, ip), specific binding of [125I]IGF-I to purified Leydig cells increased 3-fold. Scatchard analyses of the binding data suggested that increased binding was the result of an increase in receptor number, whereas binding affinity remained unaltered. Type I IGF receptor increased within 12 h and remained persistently elevated 96 h after hCG treatment. Administration of hCG (10 U, ip) daily for 5 days increased type I IGF receptor levels to 73.2 +/- 8 fmol/10(6) cells (P less than 0.001). FSH caused a small but significant increase in type I IGF receptors. Concomitant administration of FSH and hCG further enhanced IGF-I-binding capacity. IGF-I-binding affinity of Leydig cells treated with FSH or FSH plus LH was not significantly different from that in the control hypophysectomized rats. Daily administration of GH for 5 days also upregulated type I IGF receptors, whereas PRL had no effect. FSH, GH, and PRL administration had no effect on serum testosterone levels. Serum testosterone levels increased to 3.99 +/- 0.35 ng/ml after 5 days of treatment with hCG. Concomitant administration of FSH and hCG caused a further increased in serum testosterone levels (6.13 +/- 0.46 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). The present study suggests that type I IGF receptors of Leydig cells can be up-regulated by LH, FSH, and GH. However, hCG/LH seems to be the most important factor in maintaining and regulating type I IGF receptors of Leydig cells. Steroidogenic and growth-promoting effects of hCG and pituitary hormones on Leydig cells may be mediated by increased type I IGF receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Some, though not all studies, have indicated that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) can bind to adrenal medullary cells. ANP-like immunoreactivity (ANP-LI) has also been identified in catecholamine-secreting cells. Together, these findings suggest that ANP may be taken up and/or synthesized in the adrenal medulla. The present study was designed to ascertain, by in situ hybridization, whether adrenal chromaffin cells could synthesize ANP, to define by an in vivo ultrastructural autoradiographic approach, whether ANP could, in fact, bind to rat adrenal medulla cells, to determine whether there was a cellular [noradrenaline (NA) vs. adrenaline (A)] selectivity in the binding process, and to establish whether extracellular [125I]ANP could be internalized by these cells. The cellular and subcellular distribution of endogenous ANP-LI was also investigated in both cell types by cryoultramicrotomy and immunocytochemical approaches. The in situ hybridization studies indicate the presence of mRNA to ANP in about 15% of adrenal medullary cells. Intravenous injection of [125I]ANP resulted in a 3-fold, preferential and specific radiolabeling of A-as compared to NA-containing cells. In A-containing cells, plasma membranes were significantly labeled 2 and 5 min post injection; cytoplasmic matrix, mitochondria, and secretory granules throughout the time course studied (1-30 min post injection). Lysosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and nuclei were not labeled. ANP-LI was identified in both NA- and A-containing cells; in the former, it was almost exclusively localized in secretory vesicles, in the latter it was detected in plasma membranes, cytoplasmic matrix, nuclear euchromatin, some mitochondria and relatively fewer granules than in NA-containing cells. The findings suggest that ANP may be synthesized primarily in NA-containing cells and that A-containing cells primarily bind and internalize the extracellular (endogenous or exogenous) atrial peptide. The data suggest that ANP secreted by adrenal medullary chromaffin cells may have distal paracrine actions or interactions with coreleased catecholamines and neuropeptides. Binding and internalization may reflect an action of ANP on the secretory function of A-containing cells.\r"

All of these agents were found to stimulate GLI peptide release, to 120-230% of paired control values (P less than 0.05-0.001). (Bu)2cAMP, but not the phorbol ester, also increased the total cell content of GLI peptides over the 2-h incubation period (P less than 0.05). No synergism between any of the three pathways was detected. When the mol wt distribution of the stored and secreted GLI peptides was determined in control and (Bu)2 cAMP-stimulated samples, 68 +/- 2% of the peptide corresponded to glicentin, while the remainder eluted with the same distribution coefficient as oxyntomodulin. No 3.5K glucagon was detected in any of the extracts. GLI peptide secretion by the cells was not altered by several pancreatic glucagon secretagogues (cortisol, bombesin, and prostaglandins E1 and D2), but was stimulated by the opioid peptide beta-endorphin (1 microM; P less than 0.02). These studies have indicated that the control of secretion of fetal rat intestinal GLI peptides is complex, involving activation of any one or a combination of the three major second messenger systems. A role for the adenylate cyclase pathway in regulating GLI peptide biosynthesis is also suggested.\r"

The present study examined the roles of FSH and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) in regulating the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in Sertoli cells. Sertoli cell cultures prepared from 16- to 18-day-old rats were incubated for 24 h with myo-[2-3H] inositol to label endogenous phospholipids. Treatment of cells from 0.5-20 min with preparations of ovine FSH ranging in potency from 1-60 times that of NIH FSH S1 did not affect accumulation of inositol phosphates. Levels of total [3H]inositol phosphates [[3H]inositol mono-, di-, and triphosphates (IP, IP2, and IP3)] in FSH-treated cultures was 75-120% the levels in control cultures over the various time intervals studied. Addition of testosterone and the combination of testosterone plus retinoic acid, agents that have been shown to potentiate effects of FSH in other systems, did not affect accumulation of inositol phosphates in response to FSH. In contrast to the lack of effect on accumulation of inositol phosphates, FSH stimulated 4- to 11-fold increases in estradiol secretion over 24 h of culture, indicating that Sertoli cells were viable and responsive to FSH. AIF4- has been shown to activate G-proteins involved in regulation of adenylate cyclase activity. In the present study, AIF4- induced 4- to 5-fold increases in IP, IP2, and IP3 in experiments wherein FSH had no effect. Pretreatment of Sertoli cells with pertussis toxin (100 and 1000 ng/ml) for 24 h inhibited fluoride-induced generation of IP, IP2, and IP3 by 24-51%. Similar treatment with cholera toxin had no effect on basal or fluoride-induced generation of IP2 or IP3, but increased fluoride-induced generation of IP by 20-34%. These results suggest that phospholipase-C activity in Sertoli cells is modulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein(s), but does not appear to be affected by FSH.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the relationship between the stimulation of Na+ and K+ fluxes by thyroid hormone and the induction of the Na,K-ATPase, we performed a detailed comparison of the time courses of these hormonal effects in a rat liver cell line, clone 9. Stimulations of passive K+ efflux, passive Na+ influx, and ouabain-inhibitable K+ uptake were all evident within 6-12 h of exposure of cells to T3 (10(-7) M). The time course of the induction of Na,K-ATPase activity closely paralleled that of the increase in the rate of Na+ and K+ fluxes. The maximal stimulatory effects of T3 on ouabain-inhibitable K+ uptake and Na,K-ATPase activity at 72 h were +49% and +36%, respectively. Intracellular Na+ and K+ contents were virtually unchanged during these increases in ion fluxes and Na,K-ATPase activity, suggesting an efficient homeostatic adaptation to the augmented passive \"leak\" of Na+ and K+ down their transmembrane concentration gradients. T3 treatment for 72 h was also shown to stimulate both lactate production (+62%) and [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (+82%) in these cells. The onset of these effects appeared to precede that of the stimulation of Na+ and K+ fluxes, being detectable at 4 h. Neither these latter effects of T3 nor the stimulation of ouabain-inhibitable K+ uptake could be demonstrated when RNA or protein synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, respectively. It is concluded that in clone 9 cells thyroid hormone causes increases in passive Na+ influx, passive K+ efflux, active Na,K transport, and Na,K-ATPase activity whose time courses are closely parallel.\r"

  ".W": "The participation of collagenase in bone resorption has been investigated by assaying the procollagenase extracted from fetal mouse calvaria cultured under a variety of conditions, and by evaluating its ability to degrade bone collagen. Procollagenase was found in two separate pools, one requiring demineralization for its extraction, the other not. Culturing the bones with PTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, catabolin, retinoic acid, or endotoxin (but not with heparin) induced resorption, enhanced lysosomal enzyme release, and markedly increased the procollagenase content of the second pool. The PTH-induced increase in procollagenase was dose dependent and paralleled the extent of calcium loss and lysosomal enzyme release. The increase in procollagenase was found in bone, periosteum, and sutures, where its distribution was similar to that of nonmineralized collagen. The increase in procollagenase was abolished by cycloheximide, but not by indomethacin, hydroxyurea, glucocorticoids, acetazolamide, bisphosphonates, or calcitonin. Calcitonin and bisphosphonates almost completely inhibited the PTH-induced Ca loss and lysosomal enzyme release, but only partially inhibited the PTH-induced loss of collagen. The latter was, however, completely prevented by the collagenase inhibitor, CI-1. CI-1 also partially inhibited the PTH-induced Ca loss. Moreover, collagen degradation occurred in PTH-precultured calvaria (but not in noncultured controls) when incubated in a buffer under nonviable and nondemineralizing conditions. This degradation was inhibited by collagenase inhibitors, either CI-1 or the natural tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. This work thus indicates that the resorption of fetal bone explants proceeds along with an accumulation of procollagenase, primarily within their nonmineralized matrix. Moreover the results suggest that collagenase is likely to participate in the degradation of the nonmineralized collagen of the bone explants. Whether it also participates in the degradation of the collagen of the mineralized matrix remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The avian pineal gland is a photoreceptive organ that has been shown to contain postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit melatonin synthesis and/or release upon receptor activation. Physiological response and [32P]ADP ribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) were involved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiological response studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin release in dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed. Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appeared to be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partially blocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-induced inhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteins in chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared from cells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteins of 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40K Mr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of medium samples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these results suggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by [32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction in chick pineal cells.\r"

Three groups of rats were studied over 7 weeks: group D (n = 12), rats with streptozotocin (55 mg/kg)-induced diabetes given saline by gavage; group DS (n = 12), rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes given the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil (25 mg/kg) daily by gavage; and group C (n = 6), saline-injected controls. Circulating levels of ionized calcium, BGP, amino-terminal PTH, and glucose were measured on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 49. Tibial bone specimens were examined for the presence of aldose reductase by immunocytochemistry and by histomorphometry after tetracycline labeling. Diabetic rats with or without sorbinil treatment failed to gain weight [group D, 234 +/- 26 g; group DS, 217.0 +/- 40 g; group C, 310 +/- 33 g (mean +/- SD)]. Serum BGP levels decreased significantly in the diabetic rats within 7 days and remained lower throughout the study. BGP values on day 7 were: group D, 47.7 +/- 4.9 ng/ml; group DS, 65.9 +/- 5.5 ng/ml; and group C, 90.4 +/- 4 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM). Serum PTH levels were similar in all groups, except for day 49, when an increase in the D group was observed. Bone histomorphometry showed decreased bone remodeling in the D group, which confirmed the serum BGP findings. Aldose reductase was detectable in the small blood vessels and in bone itself. Sorbinil failed to influence the biochemical or bone histomorphometric abnormalities associated with diabetes. Serum BGP may be a valuable marker for the decreased bone remodeling in insulinopenic diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed in vitro to examine the possible role of calcium and calmodulin in GRF-induced somatostatin (SRIF) release from the median eminence. Adult male rats were used as tissue donors. The median eminences were first prestimulated in 0.4 ml Krebs Ringer bicarbonate glucose buffer (pH 7.4) containing bacitracin at 37C in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 with constant shaking for 30 min. When calcium was omitted, this medium was used during the prestimulation and stimulation periods. After prestimulation, the medium was discarded and replaced by medium containing the different substances to be tested (GRF, EGTA, calcium channel blockers, and calmodulin inhibitors). The stimulation of SRIF release induced by 10(-10) M GRF was not inhibited by omission of extracellular calcium or when the remaining CA+2 was chelated with 10(-4) M EGTA. The calcium channel blockers, nifendipine and verapamil (10(-6) M), failed to alter the increase of SRIF release induced by rGRF. Three calmodulin inhibitors were employed to examine the possible influence of calmodulin on GRF-induced SRIF release. Trifluoperazine (10(-6) M), triflupromazine (10(-6) M) and penfluridol (10(-7) M) had an inhibitory effect on the stimulation of SRIF release induced by GRF and failed to alter resting release. Thus, GRF can evoke SRIF release independently of extraterminal Ca+2 concentration and Ca+2 influx into the nerve terminals, but the releasing process involves translocation of Ca+2 from intracellular stores. The inhibitory effect of the calmodulin inhibitors on GRF-induced SRIF release, suggests that the translocated Ca+2 must bind to calmodulin in order to release SRIF.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of Brefeldin-A (BFA) on the processing of high mannose (Man) oligosaccharides of TSH. BFA is a drug that inhibits the intracellular translocation of newly synthesized glycoproteins and causes dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) as well as mild swelling of the Golgi apparatus. Mouse pituitary thyrotropic tumor tissue was incubated with [3H]Man for a 2-h pulse, with and without a 3-h chase; BFA (5 micrograms/ml) was included during selected pulse and selected chase incubations. TSH and free alpha-subunits were obtained from detergent lysates of tissue by immunoprecipitation using specific antisera. Total glycoproteins were obtained by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Endoglycosidase-H-released [3H]oligosaccharides were analyzed by paper chromatography. BFA inhibited carbohydrate processing of TSH, free alpha-subunits, and total glycoproteins, resulting in the accumulation of Man8GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2, Man6GlcNAc2, and Man5GlcNAc2, especially during the chase period. Subcellular fractions enriched in RER, heavy (proximal) Golgi, and light (distal) Golgi were prepared by centrifugation in discontinuous sucrose gradients. [3H]Man-labeled oligosaccharides of TSH and total glycoproteins in the subcellular fractions were analyzed. In contrast to oligosaccharides with eight or nine Man residues found in control incubations, BFA caused the accumulation of oligosaccharides containing five to eight Man residues. These BFA-induced oligosaccharide alterations began in the RER and proximal Golgi with the 2-h pulse and extended into the distal Golgi during the chase incubations. Thus, BFA blocks the normal intracellular transport and processing of TSH, free alpha-subunits, and total glycoproteins within thyrotrophs, causing species with smaller than normal high Man oligosaccharides to appear in subcellular compartments as early as the RER. The translocation block between RER and Golgi produced by BFA may prevent the processing of Man8GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 by Golgi (alpha,1-2)mannosidase I, yet the species retained within the RER may be subject to ongoing processing by endoplasmic reticulum (alpha,1-2)mannosidase, resulting in the accumulation of Man5-8GlcNAc2 within the RER.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the acute release of PRL from human decidual tissue is stimulated by a 23.5 kilodalton placental protein which we designated decidual PRL-releasing factor (PRL-RF). To determine whether PRL-RF may also affect the synthesis of PRL and/or cause a secondary increase in PRL release, we have examined the effects of purified PRL-RF on the synthesis and release of PRL over a 96-h period. Exposure of dispersed decidual cells to PRL-RF (0.5 microgram/ml) stimulated a biphasic increase in PRL release with acute transient stimulation during the first 0.5 h and a delayed and sustained stimulation beginning about 8 h after exposure which persisted for the duration of the 96 h. The amounts of PRL released from PRL-RF-exposed cells after 0.5, 8, 12, 24, and 96 h were 321.2 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- SEM, n = 3), 110.2 +/- 5.3, 138.2 +/- 7.2, 194.5 +/- 11.2, and 201.5 +/- 14.2% that of control cells. Studies of the de novo synthesis of [35S]methionyl PRL indicated that the increase in PRL release after the first few hours of exposure to PRL-RF was secondary to an increase in PRL synthesis. Somatostatin (100 nM) inhibited the acute stimulatory effect of PRL-RF, but had no effect on the delayed stimulation of PRL release. On the other hand, cycloheximide (20 microM) completely inhibited the secondary increase in PRL release in response to PRL-RF but had no effect on the acute release. These results demonstrate that PRL-RF stimulates both the synthesis and release of decidual PRL.\r"

  ".W": "Rat granulosa cells isolated from the ovaries of diethylstilbestrol-primed immature rats were treated with estrogen, FSH, and growth factors to determine those factors that were required to promote DNA synthesis. Estrogen and FSH, previously shown to stimulate the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into rat granulosa cell DNA in vivo, were ineffective in vitro. Epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and fibroblast growth factor did not influence DNA synthesis whereas transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) alone had a significant effect. Neither estradiol-17 beta (5 X 10(-8)-5 X 10(-6) M) nor IGF1 augmented the actions of TGF beta and FSH. FSH did not influence the actions of epidermal growth factor or IGF1 but dramatically augmented the effect of TGF beta on DNA synthesis. FSH and TGF beta also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of granulosa cells isolated from immature rats not treated with diethylstilbestrol. The increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA stimulated by TGF beta and FSH resulted subsequently in an increase in cell number. The response of the cells to TGF beta in the presence of a constant level of FSH (10 ng/ml) was dose dependent, 2.5 ng/ml being the minimal effective concentration. In the presence of antibody specific for TGF beta the bioactivity of the TGF beta was neutralized indicating that the growth promoting activity was due to TGF beta and not due to contaminants. In this paper, we have shown that the combined actions of FSH and TGF beta influence DNA synthesis and the proliferation of rat granulosa cells. Interactions between FSH and TGF beta may be important in regulating aspects of rat granulosa cell growth in addition to exerting pronounced effects on cytodifferentiation.\r"

The cells which exhibited a polygonal phenotype and are termed chondroprogenitor cells, developed in culture as a monolayer with a doubling time of 40-48 h in 5% fetal calf serum. Production of cAMP by the chondroprogenitor cells was stimulated by human and bovine native (1-84) PTH. The effect of PTH on cAMP production could be blocked by the (3-34) PTH analog, suggesting interaction with specific receptors. cAMP production by avian chondroprogenitor cells was also stimulated by cholera toxin, forskolin, and prostaglandin E2 but not by ACTH or prostaglandin F2 alpha. PTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin also stimulated proliferation of the chondroprogenitor cells. In contrast, neither cAMP production nor proliferation of avian skin fibroblasts was affected by PTH. Human (1-28) and rat (5-28) atrial natriuretic peptide stimulated cGMP production by avian chondroprogenitor cells and also by skin fibroblasts. Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibited the basal and PTH-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of chondroprogenitor cells, but did not affect avian skin fibroblast proliferation. These results suggest that the proliferation of avian epiphyseal growth plate chondroprogenitor cells is modulated by opposing mechanisms induced by PTH and ANP, probably mediated by cAMP and cGMP, respectively.\r"

GAP (2.4 X 10(-10) and 2.4 X 10(-9) mol) suppressed plasma PRL release but did not affect the levels of plasma LH and FSH in ovariectomized steroid-blocked rats. Furthermore, with 1-min etherization, GAP (1.6 X 10(-10) and 8.0 X 10(-10) mol) reduced the stress-induced rise of plasma PRL, but had no effect on the stress-induced decline of plasma gonadotropin levels in male rats. A single iv injection of GAP (8.0 X 10(-10) mol) into lactating rats before the onset of nursing did not block the elevation of plasma PRL induced by suckling. However, a second injection of GAP (1.6 X 10(-10) mol) at 30 min after the onset of suckling partially lowered plasma PRL levels 15 min later. By contrast, plasma FSH levels were significantly elevated by the second injection of GAP, and plasma LH also rose after iv administration of GAP in the nursing rats. These results indicate that the activity of GAP to stimulate FSH and LH release is limited, since GAP stimulated the release of FSH and LH only when plasma gonadotropin levels were extremely low. However, the in vivo evidence that GAP inhibited PRL release in a variety of conditions reinforces the possibility that GAP could be the peptidic PRL-inhibiting factor.\r"

This effect was blocked by nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist. The stimulations of PRL secretion induced by potassium (50 mM) and BAY-K-8644 were additive. Dopamine inhibited basal as well as BAY-K-8644-stimulated PRL secretion by 64% and 75%, respectively, and with respective EC50 values of 4.5 and 0.6 nM. In the presence of 50 mM K+, dopamine only partially blocks the dose-dependent stimulation of PRL secretion induced by the calcium channel agonist. The inhibitory dopamine effect was blocked by (+)butaclamol, a specific dopamine receptor antagonist. The dopamine response was also blocked by 1-sulpiride, a specific dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, and mimicked by RU 24926, a specific dopamine D2 receptor agonist, suggesting that the dopamine effect on BAY-K-8644-stimulated PRL secretion was mediated through a D2 dopamine receptor. Although unknown, the mechanism by which dopamine inhibited the BAY-K-8644-stimulated PRL secretion involves a GTP binding protein sensitive to Bordetella pertussis toxin. In fact, the dopamine inhibition of PRL secretion induced by the calcium channel agonist was blocked by the pretreatment of cells with the toxin. These results suggest that dopamine D2 receptors in lactotroph cells modulate calcium influx through a GTP binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study two recently developed techniques have been combined to enable the simultaneous in vivo determination of pulsatile release of GnRH, LH, and FSH in the orchidectomized rat. The first of these techniques involves the implantation of two vascular catheters and collecting serial blood samples through one while simultaneously infusing a replacement blood mixture through the other; consequently, blood samples can be collected for an extended period of time, and detailed plasma LH and FSH release profiles can be established for individual animals. The second technique involves push-pull perfusion of the pituitary gland to determine changes in GnRH concentration as might be perceived by the gonadotropes. For each animal (n = 6), blood (150 microliters) and push-pull perfusate (200 microliters) samples were collected at 5- and 10-min intervals, respectively, for approximately 6 h, and the hormone release profiles were determined by RIA. All of the rats showed a clear pulsatile release pattern for GnRH, LH, and FSH. Moreover, the interpulse interval was remarkably similar for each of these hormones (36.9, 41.5, and 43.5 min, respectively, as determined by PULSAR). The percentage of GnRH pulses associated with a gonadotropin pulse was 72% for LH and 76% for FSH; only 14% of the pulses were silent for both gonadotropins. These results demonstrate that in the orchidectomized rat the pulsatile pattern of GnRH release is reflected in the pulsatile pattern of not only LH but also FSH. They may, therefore, be construed to support the concept that the pulsatile secretion of both gonadotropins is primarily orchestrated by a single hypothalamic releasing hormone. Alternatively, if two separate hypothalamic releasing hormones do indeed exist (LHRH and FSH-releasing hormone), it would appear that in the orchidectomized rat their episodic release is tightly coupled to the same hypothalamic pulse generator.\r"

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was shown to be a potent dose-dependent stimulator of iIGF-I production, achieving a 3.6-fold stimulation at a dose of 10 ng/ml. Transforming growth factor-alpha (10 ng EGF equivalents/ml) was also stimulatory. Platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/ml) had no effect of its own, but enhanced EGF-stimulated iIGF-I production. The acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (100 ng/ml) had no effect alone or in combination with EGF. Transforming growth factor-beta (10 ng/ml) had no effect of its own, but inhibited EGF-stimulated iIGF-I production. The interactive effects of EGF and FSH (200 ng/ml) on iIGF-I production were investigated in short term and longer term (7-day) cultures. In short term cultures under conditions optimized for EGF-dependent iIGF-I production, FSH had no effect of its own and inhibited EGF action. Conversely, in longer term cultures optimized for FSH-dependent iIGF-I production, EGF had no effect of its own and inhibited FSH action. Thus IGF production by cultured porcine granulosa cells is regulated in a complex manner and is highly dependent on the culture conditions. Our results suggest that IGF production in the ovary may also be regulated in a complex manner which is dependent on the developmental state of the follicle.\r"

These inhibitors were distinct separable entities with opposite biological effects (agonist and antagonist) on cultured FSH-responsive Sertoli cells. In light of the fact that the agonist-containing fraction (P4) inhibited [125I]human (h) FSH binding to anti-hFSH antiserum as well as to receptor, characterization of this factor was undertaken to determine its relationship to pituitary FSH. The P4 fraction was further purified by affinity chromatography, which removed a major protein from immunoreactive components. Western blotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using polyclonal (anti-hFSH) and monoclonal (anti-hFSH beta) antibodies revealed a major immunoreactive band at 55,000 mol wt (Mr). When electrophoresed under reducing conditions, major immunoreactive proteins at 58,000 and 45,000 Mr were identified. These bands were also observed in extracts from bovine testes and raw porcine follicular fluid after electrophoresis and Western blotting. Whereas the monoclonal antibody used to characterize this inhibitor does not recognize porcine pituitary FSH, the Mr of the immunoreactive proteins are greater than that of pituitary FSH, and the immunoreactive bands do not reduce to subunits, as observed for pituitary FSH under reducing conditions, we conclude that gonadal extracts contain FSH-immunoreactive proteins that are immunologically and biochemically distinguishable from pituitary FSH. While the physiological role of these proteins remains to be determined, their presence in gonadal extracts or fluids vitiates assessment of FSH within the gonad by RIA using antiserum against hFSH.\r"

In the present study, we observed rat alpha ANP to inhibit aldosterone secretion stimulated by 10 mM potassium with an IC50 of 0.15 +/- 0.02 nM (mean +/- SE) in dispersed rat adrenal glomerulosa cells. However, when rat adrenal capsules, which contain the zona glomerulosa, were superfused in vitro, ANP had no effect on aldosterone secretion. Superfusion with 10 mM potassium increased aldosterone secretion 3- to 4-fold above baseline. Addition of 10 nM ANP to the superfusate did not lower potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion. When this same ANP-containing superfusate was incubated with dispersed adrenal glomerulosa cells, potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion was inhibited by 90%, proving sustained biological potency of the superfused ANP. Incubation of [125I]iodo-ANP with adrenal capsules for 60 min resulted in 83% degradation of [125I]iodo-ANP, whereas no detectable degradation was observed with dispersed adrenal glomerulosa cells. Removal of blood from the adrenal capsules or culturing the capsules for 48 h did not render them responsive to superfused ANP. In contrast, superfusion of 0.1 mM cycloheximide inhibited potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion by 90%. These results suggest that the adrenal capsule contains an ANP-degrading enzyme(s). This enzyme may be produced by adrenal glomerulosa cells. The local existence of a degrading enzyme for ANP may allow the zone glomerulosa to regulate its response to ANP.\r"

  ".W": "TRH is a potent stimulator of pituitary TSH release, but its function in the physiological regulation of thyroid activity is still controversial. The purpose of the present study was to investigate TRH and catecholamine secretion into hypophysial portal blood of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats, and in rats bearing paraventricular area lesions. Male rats were made hypothyroid with methimazole (0.05% in drinking water) or hyperthyroid by daily injections with T4 (10 micrograms/100 g BW). Untreated male rats served as euthyroid controls. On day 8 of treatment they were anesthetized to collect peripheral and hypophysial stalk blood. In euthyroid, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats plasma T3 was 1.21 +/- 0.04, 0.60 +/- 0.04, and 7.54 +/- 0.33 nmol/liter, plasma T4 50 +/- 3, 16 +/- 2, and 609 +/- 74 nmol/liter, and plasma TSH 1.58 +/- 0.29, 8.79 +/- 1.30, and 0.44 +/- 0.03 ng RP-2/ml, respectively. Compared with controls, hyperthyroidism reduced hypothalamic TRH release (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2 ng/h) but was without effect on catecholamine release. Hypothyroidism did not alter TRH release, but the release of dopamine increased 2-fold and that of noradrenaline decreased by 20%. Hypothalamic TRH content was not affected by the thyroid status, but dopamine content in the hypothalamus decreased by 25% in hypothyroid rats. Twelve days after placement of bilateral electrolytic lesions in the paraventricular area plasma thyroid hormones and TSH levels were lower than in control rats (T3: 0.82 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.07 nmol/liter; T4: 32 +/- 4 vs. 66 +/- 3 nmol/liter; TSH: 1.08 +/- 0.17 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.82 ng/ml). TRH release in stalk blood in rats with lesions was 15% of that of controls, whereas dopamine and adrenaline release had increased by 50% and 40%, respectively. These results suggest that part of the feedback action of thyroid hormones is exerted at the level of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, TRH seems an important drive for normal TSH secretion by the anterior pituitary gland, and thyroid hormones seem to affect the hypothalamic release of catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) have been shown to modulate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in a number of neuronal and nonneuronal cell types and to competitively antagonize TRH binding to receptors on cells of the nervous system and anterior pituitary gland. Because interaction of TRH with its receptor is known to cause enhanced influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive channels in rat pituitary GH3 cells, it was determined whether BZs and TRH were interacting with the same binding site on these cells. The potencies of three BZs, Ro5-4864, diazepam (DZP), and chlordiazepoxide (CDE), were compared as modulators of Ca2+ channels and as inhibitors of TRH binding in GH3 cells. Modulation of Ca2+ channel activity was measured as the inhibition by BZs of K+ depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx using intracellularly trapped quin 2 or 45Ca2+ uptake. The three BZs caused dose-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ influx with an order of potency of Ro 5-4864 greater than DZP greater than CDE. In contrast, the order of potency of the three BZs to inhibit [3H]TRH binding was CDE greater than DZP much greater than Ro 5-4864. The concentrations of BZs needed to inhibit Ca2+ influx and TRH binding were in the micromolar range. These data show that BZs can modulate Ca2+ channel activity in endocrine cells and that these sites are distinct from those that modulate TRH binding on pituitary cells.\r"

Apomorphine attenuated exogenous TRH-induced TSH release in both neonatal and adult rats. Morphine suppressed TSH levels at every age tested. Although clonidine and cold exposure elicited TSH secretion in adults, neonatal rats did not respond to either treatment. These findings suggest that opioid and dopaminergic controls of TSH release mature before central noradrenergic regulation in developing rats. This lack of noradrenergic control may account for the absence of the response to cold exposure in the neonate.\r"

  ".U": "88254685\r", 
  ".W": "The differential feedback actions of estrogen (E2) on gonadotropin secretion were studied by means of an in vivo isolated pituitary paradigm. Adult female rats were hypophysectomized (hypox) and the next day received single anterior pituitary transplants (graft) under the kidney capsule. At the same time rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy. On the third day each animal was fitted with a catheter system which allowed for intermittent infusions of LHRH (250 ng/5 min.h) and chronic blood sampling. Rats received LHRH infusions for 7 days. On the sixth day of LHRH infusions blood samples were collected for 4 h 5, 15, 25, 35, 45 min after each hourly LHRH pulse. After 1 h of sampling, animals received sc injections of 2 micrograms estradiol benzoate (EB; n = 5) or oil vehicle (n = 5). Plasma LH, FSH, E2, and PRL levels in samples from all groups were determined by RIA. In hypox/graft rats LH release, but not FSH release, was pulsatile in response to the hourly LHRH infusions. Injection of EB in the hypox/graft rats significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed LH release within 3 h by 57%, while FSH was unaffected. PRL levels were elevated by approximately 10-fold in the hypox/graft animals compared to those in pituitary-intact rats. These levels, however, were not changed as a function of steroid treatment and, therefore, could not account for the effects of EB on LH secretion. On the basis of these observations we conclude that 1) a major inhibitory effect of an acute injection of EB on LH secretion is exerted by a direct action on pituitary gonadotropes, and 2) E2 can differentially affect the release of LH and FSH by an intrapituitary mechanism. It is hoped that development of this model will allow for further investigation of the cellular mechanisms that mediate feedback actions of E2 on pituitary gonadotropes exposed to intermittent LHRH stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the action of thyroid hormone on the secretory proteins of the liver, we investigated the effects of thyroid hormones on the synthesis of T4-binding globulin (TBG), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), and albumin in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, Hep G2. Hep G2 cells grown to be confluent in medium with 10% fetal calf serum were further cultured in serum-free medium for 4 days, and followed by treatment with hormones for 2 days changing the medium every 24 h. On day 2 (the second 24 h of hormone treatment), about 30% of TBG accumulation was inhibited by 10(-12) M T3 and 50% was inhibited by 10(-8) M T3, although no change was observed on day 1 (the first 24 h of hormone treatment). This inhibitory effect of T3 closely resembled the effect of T3 on [35S]methionine-labeled TBG synthesis by the cells incubated for 3 h after 42 h of pretreatment. About 30-55% of the newly synthesized [35S]TBG immunoprecipitated with anti-TBG serum was inhibited by 10(-8) M T3. These results showed that thyroid hormone inhibited TBG synthesis in Hep G2 cells. On the other hand, T3 stimulated the accumulation of AGP in the media on day 1 (140% of control by 10(-8) M T3), and the effect increased drastically on day 2 (250% of control by 10(-8) M T3). No effect of T3 on albumin accumulation or total protein synthesis was seen. The concentrations of T4 which had significant effects on TBG and AGP accumulation were 10 and 10(3) times higher than those of T3, respectively. In conclusion, thyroid hormone has dualistic effects on the secretory proteins synthesized by a human hepatoblastoma cell line: physiological concentrations of thyroid hormones decrease the synthesis of TBG, but increase the synthesis of AGP.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of thyroid hormone on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) production was investigated in hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats by measuring levels of ANF mRNA and ANF in myocardium. ANF mRNA was quantitated by dot blot hybridization, and ANF by specific RIA. Relative ANF mRNA concentrations (ANF mRNA to 18S RNA) were determined for right atria, left atria, and ventricular apices. The total chamber content of ANF mRNA was estimated (concentration X total chamber RNA) and used as a measure of each tissue's synthetic capacity. For both atrial tissues, ANF mRNA contents were significantly higher in hyperthyroidism. In right atria, mean ANF mRNA contents in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 41% and 176%, respectively, of that in euthyroidism (P less than 0.05, by analysis of variance). Left atrial ANF mRNA contents in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 94% and 272%, respectively, of the euthyroid value (P less than 0.05). In contrast, atrial ANF mRNA concentrations did not differ significantly between thyroid states. In ventricle, ANF mRNA content and concentration were both correlated with serum T4 concentration. Ventricular ANF mRNA contents in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 31% and 178%, respectively, of that in euthyroidism (P less than 0.02). The concentration of ventricular ANF mRNA was also significantly increased in hyperthyroidism (P less than 0.05). Tissue content of ANF increased in the hyperthyroid right atria and decreased in the hyperthyroid left atria and ventricles. These observations suggest that increased ANF production by both atria and, to a lesser extent, by the ventricles contributes to the higher circulating ANF levels reported in hyperthyroidism. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism is associated with a specific increase in ventricular ANF mRNA expression as has been observed in other conditions causing ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "The adult testis is a source of hypothalamic neuropeptides including TRH, GnRH, POMC and CRF. The role of these neuropeptides as paracrine regulators of gonadal function in the testis remains unknown. We postulated that growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) might also be measureable in rat testis. Testes from ten post pubertal rats (400-425g, approximately 90d) were extracted and assayed in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which utilized an anti-rat GHRH antiserum and had a sensitivity of 30 pg. We detected 1.62 +/- 0.17 (M +/- SEM) ng of GHRH-like substance per g testis. The GHRH content of hypothalamus from these animals was 2.70 +/- 0.24 ng/g (N = 7.6 hypothalami/N). Fat served as a negative control tissue in which no GHRH-like material was detectable. To confirm the finding and in attempt to determine if it represented local production of GHRH, we measured GHRH mRNA using a cRNA probe subcloned from a cDNA for rat GHRH. Abundant levels of hybridizing RNA were found in mature testis by dot-blot hybridization (319% +/- 30% of the mean hypothalamus value). Northern analysis revealed that the rat hypothalamic GHRH mRNA was 715 nucleotides. In contrast, testicular GHRH(-like) mRNA was 1750 nucleotides. We conclude that there are high levels of a GHRH-like substance in mature rat testis which is present both at the level of protein product and gene transcript. The mRNA for this GHRH-like substance is substantially larger than the GHRH transcript from hypothalamus.\r"

  ".U": "88254693\r", 
  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) exhibits a wide range of biological activities, including the stimulation of secretory processes in various cell types. However, little is known regarding its possible influence on the release of brain neuropeptides. In the present study we have examined the effect of PAF on the release of three hypothalamic releasing hormones in adult male rats, and have characterized the presence of specific PAF binding sites in rat hypothalamic membranes. PAF decreased LHRH and somatostatin (SRIF) release from the median eminence with a maximal inhibition at 10(-14) M for both neuropeptides, whereas GRF release was not significantly altered. Moreover, PAF strongly counteracted the Ca2+ ionophore A 23187-stimulated release of LHRH and SRIF from median eminence and medial basal hypothalamus (greater than 50% inhibition). These results suggest an involvement of Ca2+ dependent events in PAF action. This inhibitory effect was specifically exerted at a hypothalamic site because PAF failed to depress LH and GH release from the anterior pituitary. A specific, reversible and saturable binding of [3H]PAF to membrane preparations of rat hypothalamus was demonstrated and two classes of binding sites were characterized. The affinity (KD) of each binding class was 2.14 +/- 0.32 nM and 61.63 +/- 16.4 nM, respectively, and the corresponding maximal number of each binding class was 25.41 +/- 3.2 fmol/mg protein and 146.2 +/- 47.5 fmol/mg protein. In the same conditions no specific binding was observed using rat pituitary membranes. The specificity of PAF analogs for these binding sites was well correlated to their relative effectiveness in altering LHRH and SRIF release (order of potency: L-652,731, kadsurenone greater than BN 52021 greater than Lyso-PAF). These data suggest that the binding sites identified in the hypothalamus have the characteristics expected of a specific PAF receptor and that PAF effect on neuropeptides release is a receptor-mediated process.\r"

  ".W": "The dependence of LH responses to GnRH on extracellular calcium was investigated in cultured rat pituitary cells exposed to GnRH for 3 h in static culture or for 2 min during column perifusion. During static culture in normal medium, LH release was stimulated by GnRH with an ED50 of 0.3 nM and by K+ with an ED50 of 32 mM. Incubation in Ca2+-deficient (no added Ca2+) or Ca2+-free medium (containing 100 microM EGTA) substantially decreased, but did not abolish, the LH responses to 10 and 100 nM GnRH, whereas K+-induced LH release was almost completely abolished in Ca2+-deficient medium. The Ca2+ channel agonist (BK 8644) and antagonists (nifedipine, nicardipine, verapamil, and Co2+) respectively enhanced or reduced the LH responses to both GnRH and K+. However, the calcium antagonists completely abolished the LH response to depolarization by K+, but only partially inhibited the LH response to GnRH, confirming the existence of a significant component of GnRH action that is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+. In perifused pituitary cells, exposure to Ca2+-deficient medium or normal medium containing 5 mM EGTA or 5 mM EDTA, reduced the initial rapid LH response to 2-min pulses of 10 nM GnRH and abolished the second phase of LH release. Reintroduction of Ca2+-containing medium at the end of the GnRH pulse caused recovery of the second phase of LH secretion, demonstrating that influx of extracellular Ca2+ is not required for the early phase of the LH response to GnRH but, rather, appears to be essential for its prolongation. The release of LH in response to arachidonic acid, which has been implicated in the mechanism of the secretory action of GnRH, was completely independent of extracellular Ca2+ and unaffected by addition of 10 nM BK 8644. These observations indicate that the initiation of the secretory response to GnRH is largely independent of calcium entry, whereas the prolongation of gonadotropin secretion is maintained by calcium influx, in part through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The role of arachidonic acid metabolites in GnRH action is probably related to the calcium-independent component of GnRH-induced LH secretion. Since GnRH is secreted episodically and for short periods, much of its physiological action on pulsatile gonadotropin release could be independent of calcium influx from the extracellular fluid.\r"

However, the precise role of these related metabolic derangements in various stages of clinical complications is complex. For instance, it appears that these biochemical defects may play a role not only in the initiation of diabetic neuropathy but also in its later progression. Therefore, full appreciation of the potential pathogenetic role of altered phosphoinositide metabolism in diabetic complications requires detailed studies of both the earliest and the more mature stages of these disease processes.\r"

  ".U": "88255539\r", 
  ".W": "A study of insulin-receptor internalization and recycling was undertaken in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Receptors were quantitated by measuring 125I-insulin binding to partially purified soluble receptor preparations from untreated cells (total receptors) and trypsinized cells (intracellular receptors). In resting HepG2 cells, exposure to insulin results in internalization of insulin receptors, the rate and extent of which is dependent on the insulin concentration. However, receptors do not accumulate inside the cell in proportion to the higher rates of internalization at high concentrations of insulin. This lack of accumulation is explained by much higher recycling rates after exposure to high concentrations of insulin. Similar results were noted for primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. These results imply qualitatively different fates for receptors internalized after exposure to different concentrations of insulin. To further investigate the possibility of different pathways for insulin-receptor internalization and processing, cells in low (1 ng/ml) or high (100 ng/ml) concentrations of insulin were exposed to drugs or treatments known to affect receptor metabolism. Hypotonic shock and hypokalemia, which arrest coated-pit formation, blocked internalization of insulin and insulin receptors at low concentrations of insulin but allowed internalization in response to high concentrations of insulin. The lysosomotropic drugs monensin and chloroquine caused intracellular accumulation of insulin and its receptors internalized at low concentrations of insulin but had a relatively smaller effect on receptors internalized at high concentrations of insulin. All internalization is blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol. We conclude that high doses of insulin lead to insulin-receptor internalization and recycling through a pathway that is functionally distinct from the pathway taken by receptors internalized by low (physiologic) concentrations of insulin. The pharmacologic experiments raise the possibility that the high-dose pathway, unlike the low-dose pathway, may proceed independently of coated pits and endosomal acidification.\r"

Islet tissue transplanted into spontaneously diabetic BB rats is uniformly destroyed by a recurrence of the autoimmune response that destroyed the diabetic subject's native islets. To examine recurrent autoimmune destruction of transplanted islets, it is necessary to exclude islet damage that might result from allograft rejection. We utilized neonatal tolerance induction to prevent rejection of Wistar-Furth (WF) (RT1u) islet allografts by spontaneously diabetic BB recipients. We determined that islet-recipient treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 (anti-AGM1) antibody prevents recurrent autoimmune diabetes that would otherwise destroy transplanted WF islet grafts. Anti-AGM1 therapy significantly decreased peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell activity. These data suggest a role for NK cells in the pathogenesis of recurrent diabetes in neonatally tolerant BB rats.\r"

Both tolbutamide and glyburide inhibited the A-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 10 mM with tolbutamide and at 0.2 mM with glyburide, indicating that glyburide was 50-fold as potent as tolbutamide. Neither tolbutamide nor glyburide affected [3H]cAMP binding to the protein kinase, but both inhibited the activity of catalytic units of the A-kinase. Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots revealed that the inhibitory effects of these drugs were noncompetitive with respect to the protein substrate histone, as well as to the phosphate-donor substrate ATP. Thus, tolbutamide and glyburide inhibited the A-kinase activity in rat liver cytosol, and it was suggested that, through the inhibition of A-kinase, the sulfonylureas would affect the carbohydrate metabolism in the liver. In fact, the relative potencies of these two drugs on A-kinase activity corresponded well with those of their reported antidiabetic effects.\r"

Whereas ethanol and acetaldehyde inhibited both processes at concentrations far greater than those found in alcoholic subjects, the two diols were extremely potent inhibitors of basal and insulin-stimulated adipocyte metabolism at concentrations far below those observed in alcoholic subjects. The incorporation of labeled glucose into the fatty acid moiety and glucose oxidation were inhibited at lower concentrations (0.25 microM) than those required to inhibit the incorporation of the labeled glucose into glycerol. The diols are therefore potent inhibitors of basal and insulin-stimulated adipocyte metabolism. This effect may be relevant to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in alcoholic subjects.\r"

In the first study, sciatic NCV and RICB of the tail nerve, assessed by measuring the time to disappearance of the nerve action potential after the tail was rendered ischemic, were measured in nondiabetic rats, untreated diabetic rats, and diabetic rats given Statil, an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI). Sciatic NCV was lower in the untreated diabetic animals than in control animals (P less than .05), and RICB of the tail nerve was greater (P less than .001). Treatment with the ARI completely prevented the slowing of NCV but had no significant effect on the increase in RICB. In the second study, similar groups of rats were treated with either ARI, insulin, or myo-inositol. Sciatic NCV was lower in the untreated diabetic rats than in the nondiabetic rats (P less than .001). In diabetic rats treated with the ARI and in those treated with insulin, NCV was greater than in the untreated diabetic rats (P less than .05 and P less than .001, respectively) and was not significantly different from the nondiabetic rats. NCV in the myo-inositol-treated rats was not significantly different from that in the untreated diabetic rats. RICB was assessed by measuring the decline in sciatic nerve action potential amplitude at minute intervals after death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Human islet synthesis of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and 12-HETE from endogenous arachidonate was demonstrated with stable isotope dilution-gas chromatographic-negative ion-chemical ionization-mass spectrometric analysis. Pharmacologic inhibition of arachidonate metabolism by both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways with BW 755C strongly suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion from perifused human islets, and the selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin enhanced insulin secretion. These findings are similar to those reported for islets isolated from rats and suggest that arachidonate metabolites may modulate glucose-induced insulin secretion in humans.\r"

Cardiovascular and hormonal responses to human ANF-(99-126) (125 ng/kg bolus followed by a 30-minute infusion at 25 ng/kg/min) were determined in eight conscious volunteers and compared with responses of eight time-control subjects who received isotonic saline. Baseline levels of ANF (52.8 +/- 5.5 pg/ml) increased 8.8-fold after 30 minutes of ANF infusion but were unchanged in the time controls. Plasma levels of renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, sodium, potassium, and osmolality did not change during infusions. A transient 5% reduction in mean arterial pressure related to a 12% reduction in peripheral resistance was observed 10 minutes after the priming bolus of ANF. This response was not sustained during the remainder of the ANF infusion period, nor did it occur in two additional subjects who received ANF infusions without the priming bolus. Steady state responses consisted of significant reductions in central venous pressure (15%), stroke volume (13%), and cardiac output (10%), but no reduction in blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine levels and peripheral resistance increased (34% and 9%, respectively) during ANF administration. These data indicate that steady state responses to ANF in humans consist of decreases in cardiac filling pressures, which reduce cardiac output, unload cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, and activate the sympathetic nervous system. Blood pressure is well maintained despite striking increases in plasma ANF.\r"

Each of these patients had an overlap syndrome that included features of either systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and/or polymyositis. We then used these sera to characterize the autoantigenic polypeptides of the U1 and U2 snRNP particles. In immunoblots, all sera contained antibodies to the B\" polypeptide of the U2 snRNP. A subset of these sera that more effectively immunoprecipitated the native U2 particle contained an additional antibody system that recognized the A' polypeptide of this snRNP. Antibodies eluted from the B\" protein bound the A polypeptide of the U1 snRNP and vice versa. Moreover, antibodies to the B\" polypeptide were accompanied by antibodies to the 68K and C polypeptides of the U1 snRNP. Finally, the A' and B\" polypeptides remained physically associated after the U2 particle was cleaved with RNase. Thus these sera contain multiple autoantibody systems that, at one level, target two physically associated antigenic polypeptides of the U2 particle and, at another, target two snRNP particles which are associated during the splicing of premessenger RNA. These linked autoantibody sets provide further evidence that intact macromolecular structures are targeted by the immune response in SLE and related diseases.\r"

Neither toxin stimulated release of superoxide anion from granulocytes. Toxin A produced a rapid, transient rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i, as measured by quin 2 fluorescence. Pertussis toxin and depletion of intra- and extracellular calcium blocked the toxin A effect on cytosolic [Ca2+]i.

Inhibition of phospholipase A2, and diacylglycerol lipase in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells caused a marked reduction in agonist-induced arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipid pools, and complete inhibition of prostacyclin production. EDRF release, assayed by measuring endothelium-dependent cGMP changes in mixed endothelial-smooth muscle cell cultures, was not inhibited under these conditions. In fact, EDRF release in response to two agonists, melittin and ATP, was actually increased in cells treated with phospholipase A2 inhibitors. In addition, pretreatment of rats with high-dose dexamethasone, an inhibitor of PLA2, did not attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation in intact aortic rings removed from the animals, or depressor responses in anesthetized animals induced by endothelium-dependent vasodilators. In summary, inhibition of arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipid pools does not attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation in rats, or the release and/or response to EDRF in cultured cells.\r"

  ".W": "Some studies have indicated that PGs can modulate the single nephron tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response. The aim of this study was to define the specific role of the vasoconstrictor PG, TX, by administration to rats of either vehicle (group 1; n = 20) or drugs that inhibit either cyclooxygenase (indomethacin [indo], 5 mg.kg-1, group 2, n = 17), TX synthetase (UK-38,485 [UK], 100 mg.kg-1, group 3, n = 19), or TX receptors (SQ-29,548 [SQ], 8 mg.kg-1, group 4, n = 14, or L-641,953 [L], 50 mg.kg-1, group 5, n = 8). Indo reduced excretion of the prostacyclin derivative 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 and lowered whole kidney GFR and renal plasma flow, whereas UK lowered excretion of TXB2 only and did not change basal renal hemodynamics. The TGF response (assessed from reduction in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (Psf, mmHg) during increases in perfusion of the loop of Henle (LH) from 0 to 40 nl.min-1) was unchanged after vehicle (9.8 +/- 0.5-10.9 +/- 1.0, NS) but blunted (P less than 0.001) by 40-65% in rats of groups 2-5 (indo, 11.1 +/- 1.0-4.4 +/- 0.7; UK, 9.0 +/- 0.8-4.8 +/- 0.7; SQ, 10.3 +/- 0.6-4.8 +/- 0.6; L, 10.7 +/- 0.5-6.7 +/- 1.3). This blunting was due to lower values for Psf at zero LH flow after indo, SQ, and L, and higher values of Psf at 40 nl.min-1 LH flow after indo and UK. The fall in single nephron GFR (SNGFR, nl.min-1) with increasing LH perfusion was unchanged after vehicle (10.9 +/- 2.8-11.2 +/- 0.8) but was blunted (P less than 0.05) by 45-55% in rats given indo (13.9 +/- 1.2-6.2 +/- 2.2) or UK (12.8 +/- 2.1-7.0 +/- 1.5). UK produced dose-dependent reductions in TXB2 excretion (IC50, 15 mg.kg-1) and inhibition of the TGF response (IC50: 30 mg.kg-1). After blockade of TX receptors by SQ, UK had no further affect on the TGF response. The fall in Psf at high LH flow was blunted (P less than 0.05) by indo and UK, whereas the rise in Psf at zero LH flow was blunted by indo, SQ, and L. In conclusion, endogenous TX generation can modulate the reductions in Psf and SNGFR during increased delivery of NaCl to the LH.\r"

  ".W": "Storage pool-deficient (SPD) platelets, which have decreased amounts of dense-granule and/or alpha-granule constituents, contain normal amounts of lysosomal acid hydrolases, but in some cases exhibit impaired secretion of these enzymes. We examined this impaired secretion response in SPD patients with varying extents of granule deficiencies, and determined the effects of added dense-granule constituents. Acid hydrolase secretion was impaired in patients with severe dense-granule deficiencies, but not in patients with lesser dense-granule deficiencies, including those with alpha-granule deficiencies as well. When dense-granule constituents (ADP, ATP, serotonin, Ca+2, pyrophosphate) were added to gel-filtered platelets, ADP, but none of the other constituents, completely corrected the impairment of thrombin and A23187-induced secretion in SPD platelets. The concentration of ADP required to normalize thrombin-induced secretion varied markedly, from 0.01 to 10 microM, among the individual patients. Fixation of platelets with formaldehyde before centrifugation did not prevent the enhancement of secretion by ADP. Excess ATP, which acts as a specific antagonist of ADP-mediated responses, completely blocked this enhancement of secretion in SPD platelets by ADP, and partially inhibited acid hydrolase secretion induced by low, but not high, concentrations of thrombin in normal platelets as well. Treatment of normal platelets with acetylsalicylic acid in vivo, but not in vitro, produced an impairment of acid hydrolase secretion similar in extent to that in SPD platelets, but which could not be completely corrected by added ADP. One possible explanation of these results is that the impairment of acid hydrolase secretion may be secondary to the dense-granule deficiency in SPD platelets, and that secreted ADP may potentiate the lysosomal secretion response in normal platelets as well.\r"

  ".W": "Vasopressin increases both the urea permeability and osmotic water permeability in the terminal part of the renal inner medullary collecting duct (terminal IMCD). To identify the second messengers that mediate these responses, we measured urea permeability, osmotic water permeability, intracellular calcium concentration, and cyclic AMP accumulation in isolated terminal IMCDs. After addition of vasopressin, a transient rise in intracellular calcium occurred that was coincident with increases in cyclic AMP accumulation and urea permeability. Half-maximal increases in urea permeability and osmotic water permeability occurred with 0.01 nM vasopressin. The threshold concentration for a measurable increase in cyclic AMP accumulation was approximately 0.01 nM, while measurable increases in intracellular calcium required much higher vasopressin concentrations (greater than 0.1 nM). Exogenous cyclic AMP (1 mM 8-Br-cAMP) mimicked the effect of vasopressin on urea permeability but did not produce a measurable change in intracellular calcium concentration. Conclusions: (a) Cyclic AMP is the second messenger that mediates the urea permeability response to vasopressin in the rat terminal IMCD. (b) Vasopressin increases the intracellular calcium concentration in the rat terminal IMCD, but the physiological role of this response is not yet known.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes purified by elutriation were cultured for 3 d in Teflon bags with or without human recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma). The cells were then collected and used in suspension to determine the rate of stimulus-dependent superoxide or hydrogen peroxide formation as a measure of the NADPH-oxidase. The treatment with IFN gamma increased this rate two- to threefold when phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used as the stimulus. By contrast, no IFN gamma-dependent increase in superoxide production was observed when the cells were stimulated with different concentrations of the receptor agonist N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe) alone or in combination with another receptor agonist, platelet-activating factor (PAF). At optimum concentrations, f-Met-Leu-Phe elicited rates of superoxide formation that could not be exceeded under other stimulatory conditions including PMA after treatment with IFN gamma. It thus appears that f-Met-Leu-Phe can lead to maximum activation of the NADPH-oxidase, and that this response is not influenced by IFN gamma. Treatment with IFN gamma also failed to affect the affinity of PMA- or f-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated oxidase for NADPH, the Km values being 30 to 40 microM under all conditions. IFN gamma did not alter the cellular levels of cytochrome b558, as measured by low-temperature spectroscopy, and protein kinase C, as measured by [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding, and did not appreciably influence the stimulus-dependent increase of cytosolic free calcium. These results indicate that activation of human mononuclear phagocytes by IFN gamma does not affect the level and the kinetic properties of NADPH-oxidase or its activation by receptor agonists. They confirm, however, that IFN gamma enhances the respiratory burst response to PMA.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that bradykinin stimulates the rapid release of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) from membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Since current evidence would suggest that the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) is mediated through a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in receptor-mediated activation of PLC, we evaluated the role of guanine nucleotide proteins in receptor-mediated (bradykinin-stimulated) activation of PLC in MDCK cells. Bradykinin at 10(-7) M produced a marked increase in IP3 formation within 10 s increasing from a basal level of 46.2 to 686.6 pmol/mg cell protein a 15-fold increase. Pretreatment of MDCK cells in culture with 200 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 4 h reduced the bradykinin-stimulated response to 205.8 pmol/mg protein. A 41-kD protein substrate in MDCK membranes was ADP ribosylated in vitro in the presence of pertussis toxin. The ADP ribosylation in vitro was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells in culture with pertussis toxin. Membranes from MDCK cells incubated in the presence of [3H]PIP2/phosphatidyl ethanolamine liposomes demonstrated hydrolysis of [3H]PIP2 with release of [3H]IP3 when GTP 100 microM or GTP gamma S 10 microM was added. Bradykinin 10(-7) M added with GTP 100 microM markedly increased the rate of hydrolysis within 10 s, thus demonstrating a similar time course of PLC activation as intact cells. These results demonstrate that bradykinin binds to its receptor and activates a membrane-associated PLC through a pertussis toxin-sensitive, guanine nucleotide protein.\r"

To confirm the relative effects of these variables and to characterize the transport processes involved, we measured unidirectional 22Na and 36Cl fluxes across short-circuited, distal colonic mucosa of Sprague-Dawley rats. Stripped tissues were studied in Hepes buffer and in Ringer's solutions at HCO3 concentrations of 11, 21, and 39 mM, and CO2 tensions between 0 and 69.6 mmHg. Increases in PCO2, but not in either pH or HCO3 concentration, caused similar increases in JNanet and JClnet (net flux of sodium and chloride, respectively) from -0.2 +/- 0.3 and -1.5 +/- 0.4 mu eq/cm2 per h at PCO2 = 0 to 6.8 +/- 0.6 and 7.6 +/- 0.7 mu eq/cm2 per h, respectively, at PCO2 = 69.6 mmHg. These increases were accounted for by changes in Jms and were accompanied by small decreases in Isc. 1 mM acetazolamide decreased both JNanet and JClnet and their responses to increases in CO2. 0.75 mM luminal amiloride prevented the increase in sodium absorption, but did not affect the CO2-induced increase in chloride absorption. In the presence of amiloride, CO2 increased JR (residual flux). 0.1 mM luminal furosemide did not affect the CO2-induced increases in JNanet in the absence or presence of amiloride. Changes in HCO3 concentration did not alter JR. We conclude that ambient CO2 effects active, electroneutral sodium absorption in the rat distal colon. The process stimulated by CO2 is dependent on mucosal carbonic anhydrase activity and most likely represents Na/H and Cl/HCO3 ion exchange.\r"

Glomeruli isolated from normal rats and from rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NSN), passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and cationic bovine gamma globulin (CBGG)-induced glomerulonephritis were incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (3 microM). Lipids in the glomeruli and media were extracted with ethyl acetate, and were purified and fractionated by HPLC. Immunoreactive-LTB4 (i-LTB4) was determined by radioimmunoassay on HPLC fractions with a detection limit of 50 pg of i-LTB4. A large peak of i-LTB4 that comigrated with authentic LTB4 was found exclusively in glomeruli isolated from the CBGG-injected rats. Addition of the lipoxygenase inhibitor BW755C (50 micrograms/ml) to glomerular incubation resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of i-LTB4. Synthesis of i-LTB4 by glomeruli from normal, NSN and PHN rats was undetectable. Glomerular LTB4 synthesis by CBGG-injected rats was confirmed by radiometric HPLC and by gas chromatography mass-spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis. In order to rule out synthesis of LTB4 by neutrophils entrapped in the glomeruli, a group of rats received 1,000 rad total body x irradiation, with shielding of the kidneys before induction of CBGG glomerulonephritis. Despite greater than 95% reduction in total leukocyte count, glomerular synthesis of LTB4 remained enhanced. Augmented glomerular synthesis of the proinflammatory lipid, LTB4, in the CBGG model of glomerular disease could have an important role in the development of glomerular injury and proteinuria.\r"

  ".U": "88257468\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate the synthesis of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in the failing heart, 20 human right auricles obtained at cardiovascular surgery were studied. The concentration of alpha-human ANP-like immunoreactivity (alpha-hANP-LI) in human right auricles ranged from 13.8 to 593.5 micrograms/g, and the tissue alpha-hANP-LI concentration in severe congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III and class IV) (235.4 +/- 57.2 micrograms/g) was much higher than that in mild CHF (NYHA class I and class II) (52.5 +/- 15.6 micrograms/g). Atrial alpha-hANP-LI levels were significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of alpha-hANP-LI in these patients (r = 0.84, P less than 0.01). High performance gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay for ANP revealed that the alpha-hANP-LI in the human auricle consisted of three major components of ANP, gamma-human ANP (gamma-hANP), beta-human ANP (beta-hANP) and alpha-human ANP (alpha-hANP). Comparing percentages of gamma-hANP, beta-hANP, and alpha-hANP in alpha-hANP-LI in severe CHF with those in mild CHF, the predominant component of alpha-hANP-LI was gamma-hANP in mild CHF, whereas beta-hANP and/or alpha-hANP were prevailing in severe CHF and, especially, beta-hANP was markedly increased in human failing hearts. These results demonstrate that the total ANP concentration in the atrium of the human heart is increased in severe CHF and that the increase of ANP in the human failing heart is mainly due to the increase of small molecular weight forms of ANP, beta-hANP, and alpha-hANP, especially beta-hANP, and indicate that the processing of ANP precursor, or gamma-hANP, in the human failing heart differs from that in the normal heart, suggesting that the failing heart augments synthesis and secretion of ANP as one of its own compensatory responses.\r"

Neither IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, nor platelet-derived growth factor maintained eosinophil viability. The 7- and 14-d survival of the cultured eosinophils was 55 and 53%, respectively. No other cell type, including neutrophils, was present after culture. After 7 d of culture, the normodense eosinophils were converted to hypodense cells as assessed by density centrifugation. Eosinophils exposed to 1,000 pM IL-3 for 30 min or cultured in 10 pM IL-3 for 7 d generated approximately threefold more leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in response to calcium ionophore than freshly isolated cells. Furthermore, whereas freshly isolated eosinophils killed only 14% of the antibody-coated Schistosoma mansoni larvae, these eosinophils killed 54% of the larvae when exposed to 100 pM IL-3. The enhanced helminth cytotoxicity was maintained for 7 d when eosinophils were cultured in the presence of both 10 pM IL-3 and 3T3 fibroblasts, but not when eosinophils were cultured in the presence of IL-3 alone. IL-3 thus maintains the viability of eosinophils in vitro, augments the calcium ionophore-induced generation of LTC4, enhances cytotoxicity against antibody-sensitized helminths, and induces the eosinophils to become hypodense cells. These phenotypic changes in the eosinophil may be advantageous to host defense against helminthic infections but may be disadvantageous in conditions such as allergic disease.\r"

Mean plasma t-PA antigen titres before and after venous occlusion, and mean plasma t-PA activities after venous occlusion did not differ significantly between SS patients and normal subjects. No significant differences in mean t-PA antigen and activity were observed between samples taken from inpatients being treated for acute pain crisis (18 subjects, 30 samples) and samples taken from subjects in the steady state (23 subjects, 26 samples). No consistent differences were seen between painful crisis and steady state samples in eight SS patients studied while in crisis and in the steady state. No correlation was observed between any fibrinolytic variable in SS patients and the overall severity of microvascular occlusive disease as measured by a standard scoring system.

Its performance in the one stage coagulation assay of VIII:C was equivalent to that of congenital VIII deficient plasma for the assay of normal and haemophilic plasma and factor VIII concentrates.

Altogether, 73 (45%) developed CMV infection after transplantation: 30 (18.5%) had acquired primary infection and 43 (26.5%) reactivation or reinfection. Six patients died of primary infection, probably acquired from the donor organ. Recipients negative for CMV antibody who received an organ from an antibody positive donor had the most severe disease. Heart and lung transplant recipients experienced more severe primary CMV infection than those in whom the heart alone was transplanted. The most sensitive and rapid serological method was a mu-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting CMV specific IgM, the amount of which was often of prognostic value and influenced the management of patients.\r"

The vast majority (98%) of these hybridomas secreted Ig but only 20% produced IgM. The isotype of the remaining hybridomas was determined as being IgG2b. Interestingly, when splenocytes from 1-day-old mice were stimulated with LPS for 48 h prior to the fusion event, 84% of the hybridomas were secreting IgM. The hybridoma supernatants were screened either by ELISA or RIA for binding reactivity using a panel of 17 Ag, proportionally divided between self and non-self. A binding reactivity could be assigned in 44% of cases. Of these, 29% were monoreactive, i.e., reactivity occurred with one Ag only, while the remaining 15% were multireactive. The majority (21 of 27) of hybridomas with a defined reactivity were directed against self-Ag. These included autologous red blood cells, DNA, histone H1, thyroglobulin, and Ag of the cell surface of T cells. The frequency of utilization of VH genes was determined using DNA probes for eight VH gene families. While all VH gene families appeared to have been used, one, VH 7183, had a slight but significant (p less than 0.02) higher utilization than expected by random expression. The frequency of all the other VH gene families was not significantly different from random utilization. No correlation was found between Ag reactivity in the supernatants and the utilization of a particular VH gene family. These findings indicate that early in the ontogeny the predominant reactivity of B cells is for self-Ag and, unlike what it is commonly believed, the IgM isotype is not dominant within these endogenously activated B cells at this time of ontogeny when genes from all VH families are utilized.\r"

  ".U": "88258041\r", 
  ".W": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used drug in the treatment of a variety of human neoplasms. Trimetrexate (TMQ) is a lipid-soluble quinazoline derivate of MTX that, unlike MTX, is not dependent upon membrane folate transport for cellular entry. A number of studies have demonstrated that MTX and, more recently, TMQ possess potent immunosuppressive properties. To examine the cellular events associated with the immunomodulatory effects of anti-folates on humoral immunity, a murine B cell maturation model was used. In vitro, MTX and TMQ reduced the number of antibody-forming cells to SRBC, as well as IgM production. B cells stimulated with anti-Ig demonstrated a dose-related suppression in [3H]UdR incorporation after addition of either drug, suggestive of a decrease in de novo DNA synthesis. B cell activation events preceding S phase were also suppressed by both anti-folates, as evidenced by inhibition of RNA synthesis. However, neither drug affected surface expression of Ia Ag nor inositol phosphate accumulation. Addition of TdR caused a slight non-significant increase in the antibody-forming cell response in the presence of 10(-7) M MTX. However, addition of hypoxanthine or adenine, but not guanine, resulted in complete restoration. Timed addition revealed that the ability of MTX to suppress antibody responses was diminished if added after 48 h of culture, similar to the reversal of this suppression mediated by hypoxanthine. Cell cycle analysis of LPS-stimulated B lymphocytes demonstrated that both drugs modulated events preceding, as well as during, the S phase. The present studies suggest that although drug-induced impairments in dTMP biosynthesis may be responsible for deficient lymphoid proliferation, anti-folate-induced impairment in purine biosynthesis is a major mechanism in anti-folate-induced suppression of humoral immunity.\r"

Furthermore, although no endogenous IL-2 production was detected, p75 was readily cross-linked to p55 for EL4J-3.4, a p55 transfectant of EL4 that bears high affinity IL-2R. These results strongly suggest that high affinity IL-2R exist as a preformed heterodimer of p55 and p75 which do not require IL-2 for their association. Furthermore, cross-linking of three other proteins of apparent Mr of 100,000, 135,000, and 180,000 to p55 was also seen, raising the possibility of a more complex subunit composition for the IL-2R.\r"

Furthermore, it was found that endogenous HuTNF-alpha is produced after allogeneic cell interaction and can be detected in the MLR supernatant within 1 h of culture initiation. The results also show that, in the absence of exogenous HuTNF-alpha, antibodies to rHuTNF-alpha can cause a significant inhibition of the MLR.

This response of T cells to IL-4 plus PMA is independent of the action of IL-2 as judged by 1) the lack of IL-2 in supernatants of stimulated cells, 2) the failure to detect IL-2 mRNA in stimulated cells by in situ hybridization, 3) the inability of anti-IL-2R antibody and of anti-IL-2 antibody to block responses to IL-4 plus PMA, and 4) the failure of cyclosporin A to block responses. T cells also respond to anti-CD3 antibodies and IL-4 in the presence of anti-IL-2R antibodies. IL-4 stimulation of growth of the long term T cell line HT-2 also appears to be independent of the action of IL-2. No IL-2 mRNA is found in IL-4-stimulated HT-2 cells by Northern blotting; the response of HT-2 cells to IL-4 is not blocked by anti-IL-2R antibodies; the response of HT-2 cells to IL-4 is not inhibited by cyclosporin A. Although IL-4 stimulation of T cells is independent of IL-2, IL-4 plus PMA treatment of resting T cells does cause enhanced expression of IL-2R and prepares cells to proliferate to IL-2 alone. In both these properties IL-4 resembles IL-2. These experiments lead us to conclude that IL-4 can act as an alternative to IL-2 as authentic T cell growth factor.\r"

At the height of activation, these cells also release a soluble form of IL-2R (sIL-2R). Using either crude supernatant or a semi-purified preparation of sIL-2R obtained by affinity chromatography, studies were performed to characterize murine sIL-2R. Its m.w. was determined by both gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. The affinity of sIL-2R for a panel of mAb known to recognize different epitopes of mIL-2R (p55 subunit) was assessed by saturation and competition experiments. The relationship between the various epitopes was studied by cross-inhibition experiments. The data suggest that sIL-2R and mIL-2R (p55 subunit) are structurally similar. The ability of sIL-2R to bind IL-2 was assessed by measuring the dissociation and the inhibition constant of the molecule for IL-2. Both values coincide and indicate that the affinity of sIL-2R for IL-2 is at least 10-fold lower than the that of low affinity mIL-2R. The biologic implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

The results showed that CKS-17 coupled to a carrier protein, BSA, inhibited production of IFN-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Controls, consisting of BSA, which had undergone the coupling procedure or neurotensin coupled to BSA in an identical manner as CKS-17, showed no such inhibition. Reduction in IFN-gamma production could not be attributed to decreased viability of cells, delay of IFN-gamma production or to involvement of suppressor cells. Moreover, inhibition of IFN-gamma production was not related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The inhibition appeared to be a direct effect of CKS-17 on IFN-gamma-producing cells. Kinetic studies revealed that this suppression occurred when CKS-17 was introduced to the culture concurrent with or within 48 h after introduction of IFN inducers. Preincubation experiments showed that the presence of CKS-17 in the culture medium was not necessary to exert its inhibitory effect. These results suggest that a portion of retroviral envelope proteins possess important immunomodulatory actions.\r"

Macrophages treated with LK depleted of IFN-gamma failed to acquire this activated macrophage effector activity. Paradoxically, IFN-gamma by itself was also not effective. Activity of the ineffective, IFN-gamma-depleted LK was restored, however, by addition of 10 to 100 U/ml IFN-gamma, itself inactive. The induction of this antimicrobial activity was the result of the interaction of macrophages and several molecularly distinct LK, and IFN-gamma was a necessary but insufficient activation signal. The activation of macrophage resistance to infection by LK was 1) not signal sequence dependent, 2) absent in cells treated with the second signal at lower (4 degrees C) temperatures and in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, and 3) induced by the cooperation of IFN-gamma and LK of m.w. 45,000 and 33,000. These factors in LK constituted more than 85% total LK activity for induction of resistance to infection. A minor activity in LK, of m.w. 20,000, could apparently induce this effector activity in the absence of IFN-gamma: this activity was less than 15% of total LK activity.\r"

Comparison with class I molecules from other species strongly suggests these cDNA are derived from different genes and provides evidence for the existence of a second expressed class I BoLA locus.

The V kappa exons are organized into groups of highly homologous coding regions (approximately 300 bp) separated by approximately 10 kbp of intervening sequence. A group contains from 1 to 30 or more exons (exon refers to uninterrupted coding region DNA which is capable of encoding all or part of V kappa gene) that can be detected with specific DNA probes in conjunction with restriction endonuclease fragments (REF) from genomic DNA. Thirteen DNA probes specific for different V kappa exon groups and one DNA probe specific for J kappa and C kappa exons were used in conjunction with 55 inbred strains in an attempt to detect RFLP that could be used to establish Ig kappa allelic groups and Ig kappa haplotypes. Each probe detected two to four different REF patterns (allelic groups) among the panel of inbred mice examined. Size estimates of the REF were made, and each probe detected 4.2 to 107.7 kbp of DNA, including faint REF, 675.6 to 723.6 kbp of DNA could be detected within a single haplotype. Based on these allelic groups, seven haplotypes were identified among the 55 inbred strains of mice. No subline differences were detected, and the distribution of allelic groups implied common ancestry among many of the inbred strains examined. The DNA probes were also used in conjunction with recombinant inbred, congenic strains and backcross populations of mice. By using the analysis of known Ig kappa r populations, and assuming a common ancestry among the inbred strains, a gene order was predicted: Centromere-Hd-(Ig kappa-V11, Ig kappa-V24, Ig kappa-V9-26)-(Ig kappa-V1, Ig kappa-V9)-(Ig kappa-V4, Ig kappa-V8, Ig kappa-V10, Ig kappa-V12, 13, Ig kappa-V19)-(Ig kappa-V28, Rn7s-6)-Ig kappa-V23-(Ig kappa-V21, Ig kappa-J, Ig kappa-C)-(Ly2, Ly3)-wa-1.\r"

  ".W": "This study explores the limitations on variability at a polymorphic position of an MHC class II molecule. Using a convenient and rapid method termed \"slot-machine mutagenesis,\" we have converted Glu75 on the A kappa-chain to 15 alternative amino acids. This residue is of interest because it is an immunodominant site on the A kappa alpha chain and because it participates in certain T cell epitopes. The wild-type and mutant A kappa alpha cDNA were transfected into L cells (together with the A kappa beta cDNA and a selection marker), and transfectants displaying high surface levels of the A kappa complex were selected and expanded. We sought to examine three questions: what is the effect of these mutations on the expression and overall conformation of the A alpha: A beta complex? How do these diverse mutations influence mAb epitopes for which Glu75 makes a direct contribution to specificity? Do such substitutions affect T cell recognition of the A kappa alpha:A kappa beta complex? The answers to these three questions are quite different. Position 75 of the A alpha chain can accommodate essentially all chemically divergent amino acids without major consequences for expression and overall A alpha:A beta structure. In contrast, mAb that recognize Glu75-dependent epitopes are extremely particular about the amino acid residing at this position. T cells are less fastidious: those that are affected by the mutations still recognize a number of substitutions. These data emphasize the tolerance of MHC molecules to evolutionary tampering.\r"

  ".W": "With subpopulations of human lymphoid cells that were enriched for lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell precursors, studies were performed to examine the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on their IL-2-dependent growth and differentiation to killer cells. The majority of the LAK precursor cells appeared to reside in nonadherent, non-T, and non-B lymphocyte populations that expressed CD11 and CD16 Ag. These cells were induced to proliferate and become LAK cells by high concentrations of rIL-2 alone in the apparent absence of any prior activation with mitogen or Ag. The partially purified lymphocyte subpopulations generated varying but several-fold greater levels of LAK killing on a per cell basis than did unfractionated lymphocytes. The exogenous addition of TGF-beta to the LAK precursor cultures, markedly inhibited IL-2-stimulated growth as well as the development of LAK activity in a dose-dependent manner. The antimitotic effect of TGF-beta was reversible; inhibition of proliferation could be largely restored by increasing the concentration of IL-2 in culture. In contrast, TGF-beta inhibition of cytotoxicity was relatively independent of the concentration of IL-2. Further, LAK precursors constitutively expressed TGF-beta mRNA and high affinity receptor for TGF-beta. Activation of LAK precursors with IL-2 alone, resulted in a three- to fivefold up-regulation of intracellular TGF-beta mRNA and TGF-beta biologic activity secreted in the culture media. Furthermore, Northern blotting revealed that the resting LAK precursors did not express the Tac-mRNA. Receptor binding studies with 125I-IL-2 suggested the presence of a single class of IL-2R with an apparent Kd of intermediate range (beta-chain of IL-2R) on the unstimulated cells. Stimulation with high concentrations of Il-2 induced Tac-mRNA (both the 3.5- and 1.5-kb transcripts) and resulted in the expression of high affinity IL-2R (Kd approximately 10(-11) M) on these cells. Suppression of IL-2-dependent responses by TGF-beta was accompanied by a selective down-regulation of the 1.5-kb Tac-mRNA as well as by reduction in high affinity IL-2R. The results suggest a negative autocrine control of TGF-beta on IL-2-dependent growth and differentiation of human LAK cells, possibly related to regulate the killer activation function.\r"
