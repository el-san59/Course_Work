  ".W": "A major portion of the hCG immunoreactivity detectable in pregnancy urine is derived from a fragment of hCG beta. This lacks the COOH-terminal portion of hCG beta, but retains immunoreactivity with most antibodies raised against the beta-subunit of hCG. To improve clinical measurements of hCG and assess the importance of such fragments in human urine, we have isolated and determined the structure of this molecule. The hCG beta fragment was isolated from a partially purified commercial preparation of hCG (Organon) by gel filtration and immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies. It was found to consist of two polypeptide chains composed of residues beta-(6-40) disulfide-bridged to residues beta-(55-92). It also differs from the beta-subunit of hCG in its carbohydrate structure, lacking sialic acid and having a low but variable amount of galactose. A beta-fragment containing the same two NH2-terminal sequences was also isolated from a single pregnant woman's urine. The two major polypeptides comprising the beta-fragment contain a total of nine half-cystine residues, raising the possibility that a free thiol may exist or that a third undetected disulfide-bridged peptide is present in the intact fragment. However, tests for the presence of a free thiol have been negative. Another intrinsic characteristic of the beta-fragment is the formation of a variable amount of dimer in solutions of neutral pH. beta-fragment will not combine with intact alpha-subunit. Despite the absence of regions beta-(1-5), beta-(41-54), and beta-(93-145), the beta fragment is recognized by the SB-6 antibody and most monoclonal antibodies elicited to the beta-subunit, thus excluding half of the amino acids of the beta-subunit from the epitope(s) where these antibodies bind.\r"

  ".W": "hCG is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two dissimilar subunits (alpha and beta) and is normally synthesized by trophoblastic tissue. Its measurement by immunoassay is widely employed as a test for pregnancy, but can be complicated by cross-reactivity with human (h) LH. Immunoassays based on the beta-subunit of hCG have been employed to decrease this cross-reactivity with hLH, but when these assays are used with urine specimens, the antibodies employed also detect a fragment of hCG beta, which can lead to significant differences in measurement. To overcome these problems, we have developed a series of monoclonal antibodies to the beta fragment of hCG recovered from pregnancy urine. Some of the antibodies that bind to this beta fragment are directed to a region of hCG beta that is different from the epitopes recognized by antibodies raised against the intact beta-subunit. The new epitopes available in the hCG beta fragment form the basis for novel immunoassays. These beta fragment antibodies are used in conjunction with other antibodies, directed to different epitopes of the hormone, to produce a series of immunoradiometric assays that can discriminate among intact hormone, free hCG beta, and hCG beta fragment. The hCG beta fragment antibodies described herein have affinities between 10(9) and 10(11) M-1 for the beta fragment and exhibit varying degrees of discrimination between the hCG beta fragment, the beta-subunits of hCG and hLH, and intact hCG and hLH.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies against the androgen receptor (AR) will provide useful probes for elucidating both the structure and function of this important regulatory protein. Recently, human autoimmune anti-AR sera have been described. The purpose of the current work was to immortalize lymphocytes from the blood of patients with high titer anti-AR antibodies and to produce monoclonal antibodies against the receptor in vitro. Human serum samples (10 microliters) were incubated in high ionic strength buffer (400 mM KCl) for 16 h at 0 C with [3H]Mibolerone-labeled cytosol (100-200 fmol AR) from Dunning tumors. Receptor-antibody complexes were precipitated with goat antihuman immunoglobulin (Ig) antibody. From our 1005 serum samples examined, 5 specimens were detected which precipitated greater than 40% of the AR. These antibodies recognized the AR from human, rat, mouse, dog, steer, chicken, and hamster, but did not recognize estrogen, progesterone, or glucocorticoid receptors. By sucrose gradient analysis in high salt (0.4 M KCl) 1 of the antisera shifted the 4.4S monomeric receptor to 8S, and the others shifted the receptor to 18S. However, all of the antibodies were shown to be IgG class by immunoprecipitation with class-specific second antibodies. Peripheral blood lymphocytes donated by these patients were isolated by histopaque density gradient sedimentation, activated in vitro, transformed with Epstein-Barr virus, and seeded into 96-well plates. From 263 million human lymphocytes plated in 96-well dishes, 1215 wells gave rise to Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, and 8 of these wells were determined to be anti-AR positive. Cells from 2 of the positive wells were cloned and designated CB54 and UA67, both of which secreted IgG class antibodies against the AR. These 2 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be highly specific for the AR and to cross-react with the AR from human, rat, and hamster. Studies with the monomeric form of the AR and its proteolytic fragment using sucrose density gradients have suggested that the 2 antibodies recognize different epitopes on the monomeric AR molecule. Furthermore, by Western blot analysis the antibodies have identified the AR as an 118K protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, which is consistent with our previous findings of the mol wt of the AR.\r"

GH-containing somatotrophs and PRL-containing lactotrophs were isolated from adult female rats using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting techniques and were maintained in culture for 1-4 days. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made to analyze the ICa, and [Ca2+]i was measured with fura-2. Cell type was verified after each recording by indirect immunocytochemistry. GH and PRL cells could be divided into two groups: silent and spontaneously active. Silent cells had stable membrane potentials and stable levels of [Ca2+]i. Spontaneously active cells exhibited spontaneous action potentials and large fluctuations in [Ca2+]i. Two types of ICa were found: a low threshold, transient current which was insensitive to the dihydropyridine -Bay 5417 (the negative isomer of Bay K 8644), and a high threshold, sustained current which was enhanced by -Bay 5417. Both types of ICa were present in PRL and GH cells, but each cell type differed quantitatively in the proportion of each current type. While the GH cells had a more prominent, low threshold, transient ICa, the PRL cells had a more prominent, high threshold, sustained ICa. The enhancement of ICa by -Bay 5417 was greater in the PRL cells, which have a larger dihydropyridine-sensitive ICa. Parallel fura-2 measurements showed an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to 50 mM KCl and -Bay 5417 for both lactotrophs and somatotrophs.\r"

  ".U": "88254687\r", 
  ".W": "The present studies were designed to test if estrogens influence basal and angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated ACTH release and the binding characteristics of AII receptors in isolated anterior pituitary (AP) cells from estrogen-deplete and estrogen-replete rats incubated in vitro. AP cells were obtained from various adult donors: randomly cycling (rc), 10-day ovariectomized (Ovx), Ovx with estradiol restored at a circulating physiological level (Ovx + lEB), Ovx with estradiol at a supraphysiological circulating level (Ovx + hEB); and male (m) rats. The amount of ACTH released under basal conditions was similar in the rc, Ovx + lEB, and m groups, although this amount was significantly greater (P less than 0.02) than that in the Ovx and Ovx + hEB groups. The ACTH-releasing activity (CRA) of AII was concentration dependent (10(-9)-10(-6) M) in all cells. The rank order of the CRA of AII in the groups varied as follows: rc = Ovx + lEB greater than Ovx = Ovx + hEB = m. The slopes of the AII responses were similar. Estradiol addition in vitro did not modify either basal or AII-stimulated ACTH release in any group of cells. AII binding studies indicated that AP cells from donors with different circulating estradiol levels had similar apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd, 16-30 nM). However, the maximum binding capacities in AP cells from the m, Ovx, and Ovx + hEB groups (40, 51, and 49 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than those in the rc and Ovx + lEB groups (77 and 81 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively). In summary, these studies indicate that 1) circulating levels of estradiol are able to modulate spontaneous ACTH release by dispersed AP cells; and 2) circulating estradiol, at a lower or higher level than that during the estrous cycle, decreases the in vitro ACTH-releasing activity of AII, possibly through a reduction in the number of AP AII receptors. These results further suggest that estrogen is likely to have a physiological role in corticotropic function.\r"

One hour after the end of the vehicle or steroid infusions, nitroprusside (20 micrograms/kg.min) was infused for 10 min to induce hypotension-stimulated ACTH secretion. Nitroprusside produced similar decreases in arterial blood pressure in all groups. Infusion of F alone inhibited plasma ACTH responses to hypotension. Whereas infusion of P without F did not significantly change plasma ACTH responses to hypotension, infusion of P with F caused greater ACTH responses to hypotension than did infusion of F alone. The results indicate that P can interfere with the delayed feedback effect of F in vivo.\r"

We tested this drug in dog thyroid slices to ascertain the role of lysosomal pH in thyroglobulin hydrolysis and hormone secretion. Monensin (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and another carboxylic ionophore, nigericin (10(-7)-10(-5) M), inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner TSH-stimulated secretion of T4, T3, and iodide. This inhibition was not toxic since: 1) 10(-5) M monensin did not affect TSH stimulation of protein iodination and cAMP accumulation; and 2) the inhibition was reversible. Secretion was blocked at a postphagocytotic, presumably lysosomal step because the time lag for the fall in secretion rate after 10(-5) M monensin addition was 19 min +/- (SD) 3 min (six experiments), i.e. the same as after lysosomotropic amine addition and significantly shorter than after addition of cytochalasin B (time lag, 43 min +/- 7 min, nine experiments), an inhibitor of phagocytosis. In addition, 10(-5) M monensin blocked the TSH-induced formation of apical pseudopods and colloid droplets and induced a swelling of the Golgi structures. In conclusion, monensin interfered with phagocytosis and with a postphagocytotic, presumably lysosomal, step in secretion by dog thyroid in vitro. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence, in the intact cell, that an acidic pH in the prelysosomal and/or lysosomal compartment is necessary for thyroid hormone secretion.\r"

  ".U": "88254694\r", 
  ".W": "The distribution and movement of cholesterol were studied in granulosa cells from the ovaries of estrogen-stimulated hypophysectomized immature rats cultured in serum-free medium. Plasma membrane cholesterol was distinguished from intracellular cholesterol with cholesterol oxidase, an enzyme that converts cell surface cholesterol to cholestenone, leaving intracellular cholesterol untouched. Using this approach we showed that 82% of unesterified cholesterol was associated with the plasma membrane in granulosa cells cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium in both the presence and absence of added androstenedione and FSH. FSH and androstenedione stimulated a marked increase in steroid hormone (progestin) production. The movement of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane also was followed using cholesterol oxidase. Newly synthesized cholesterol reached the plasma membrane too rapidly to be measured in unstimulated cells (t1/2 less than 20 min); however, in cells stimulated by FSH and androstenedione, this rate was considerably slower (t1/2 approximately 2h). Therefore, cholesterol movement to the plasma membrane appears to be regulated by gonadotropins in these cells. We tested whether steroid biosynthesis used all cell cholesterol pools equally. To this end we administered [3H]acetate and [14C]acetate at different times and determined their relative specific contents in various steroids after defined intervals. The relative ages of the steroids (youngest to oldest) were: lanosterol, progestins, intracellular cholesterol, and plasma membrane cholesterol. This finding suggests that progestins use newly synthesized intracellular cholesterol in preference to preexisting intracellular or cell surface cholesterol. A measure of this effect is that the specific activity of secreted hormone was 15- to 30-fold greater than that of intracellular cholesterol. We conclude that the various cholesterol compartments in granulosa cells are discrete. While the major fraction of cholesterol in these steroidogenic cells resides in the plasma membrane, it is not in rapid equilibrium with intracellular cholesterol. Furthermore, steroidogenesis appears to use newly synthesized over preexisting cholesterol, suggesting a shunt pathway.\r"

Concentrations of FSH in serum were positively related to levels of LH, FSH, E2, and total protein in FF (P less than 0.005). E2 levels in serum were predictive of E2 levels in FF only, and levels of P in serum were directly correlated with P levels in FF (P less than 0.05). With respect to the peculiarly broad range of predictions that could be drawn from the FSH content of serum, peripheral FSH provided a better predictive index of the chemical composition of antral fluid than did the level of any other single hormone measured in serum.\r"

E2 at concentrations of 2 pg/ml to 2 X 10(6) pg/ml had no effect on sperm motility or egg penetration.

PMN-elastase levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and WBC numbers by a recently described immunohistologic technique. PMN-elastase levels in seminal plasma correlated well with WBC numbers in semen (r = +0.755). A three-step grading system of PMN-elastase values as low/normal (less than 250 ng/ml), intermediate (250 to 1000 ng/ml) and high/pathologic (greater than 1000 ng/ml) showed a highly significant relationship to a similar WBC number grading system: low/normal, less than 10(5) WBC/ml, intermediate, 10(5) to 10(6) WBC/ml, and high/leukocytospermic, greater than 10(6) WBC/ml semen. Incubation of semen at 37 degrees C resulted in a slight continuous decrease of immunoreactive PMN-elastase at a rate of approximately 10% per 3 hours. As all 18 samples with more than 1000 ng PMN-elastase per ml seminal plasma showed more than 10(6) WBC/ml semen, PMN-elastase levels above 1000 ng/ml were diagnostic for leukocytospermia.\r"

Linear stepwise discriminant analysis was used to identify the more powerful parameters and to create a model employing eight parameters. The jackknifed classification procedure distinguished normal from abnormal sperm with 95% accuracy and correctly assigned 86% of the sperm to one of 10 shape classes. Most of the misclassification errors occurred among closely related classes. The results demonstrate the ability of automated image analysis to classify individual sperm into clinically familiar shape categories.\r"

Ovaries were perfused in the presence or absence of CC (10(-5) M) and estradiol (E2, 100 ng/ml). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 50 IU) was added to the perfusate of all ovaries. In vitro ovulated ova were retrieved, inseminated, and transferred to host rabbits. Neither CC nor CC + E2 significantly affected hCG-induced ovulation or fertilization. CC significantly reduced (P less than 0.025) percentage of ovulated ova resulting in offspring. Addition of E2 significantly (P less than 0.05) reversed the reduction in offspring associated with CC alone. These results may be due to the antiestrogenic effects of CC on the intrafollicular oocyte, which compromises postfertilization development.\r"

The drug treatment was well tolerated, but it lengthened the post-treatment menstrual cycle on average by 4 days.

Zona drilling entails use of micromanipulation to introduce a gap in the zona pellucida either mechanically or by localized application of a zona solvent from a microneedle. Ten couples were treated, from whom 63 oocytes were recovered for manipulation. Sixteen eggs were denuded of the cumulus oophorus only, and the remaining 47 eggs were subjected to zona drilling. Of the 16 eggs denuded but not drilled, 4 (25%) were fertilized. Of the 47 oocytes drilled, 31 survived (67%) and 10 of the surviving eggs (32%) were fertilized. The polyspermy rate for drilled eggs that fertilized was high (5/10, 50%), and polyspermic eggs were often penetrated by more than two spermatozoa. The remaining five eggs fertilized after drilling were diploid fertilizations, and in three cases cleavage was followed by embryo transfer, although pregnancies were not obtained. These data indicate that zona drilling has the potential for establishing pregnancies in instances where treatment by standard IVF would fail. In addition, results indicate that the block to polyspermy in human eggs occurs at the level of the zona pellucida.\r"

During this period 82 patients accepted for IVF became pregnant spontaneously: 44 before treatment and 38 after a failed IVF treatment cycle (group B). Of these, 14 were ectopic pregnancies and 8 were miscarriages. The main indications for acceptance on the IVF program were similar in the two groups if those patients who had a bilateral salpingectomy are excluded from group A. Causative factors for the high ectopic pregnancy rate are discussed. The authors suggest that after embryo transfer, migration of the embryo or embryos into the fallopian tubes occurs more frequently than realized, and the diseased tube is less likely than a normal tube to propel the embryo back into the uterus. The abortion rate in group B was similar to the rate in the general population.\r"

At 37 degrees C, tcPO2 in the legs and feet of diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy was significantly higher (P less than .02) than in control subjects and diabetic patients without neuropathy. Whereas tcPO2 in the legs of control subjects and nonneuropathic diabetic patients was greater than in the feet (P less than .02), this leg-to-foot difference was absent in diabetic patients with neuropathy. After an increase in skin temperature to 44 degrees C, tcPO2 increased in the legs and feet of all three groups, but the increase was smallest in diabetic patients with neuropathy and greatest in control subjects. In neuropathic (P less than .02) and nonneuropathic (P less than .02) diabetic patients, tcPO2 was significantly lower than in control subjects. These data are consistent with a loss of vasoconstrictor tone in the blood vessels perfusing skin and subcutaneous tissue at 37 degrees C and an inability of these vessels to vasodilate and increase blood flow at 44 degrees C in diabetic patients in general and neuropathic diabetic patients in particular. This inability to increase tcPO2 after an increase in temperature and possibly other vasodilatory stimuli may contribute to the pathogenesis of nonhealing ulcers, protracted infections, and gangrene, which characterize the diabetic foot.\r"

A similar association has been noted in Fiji Indians, another migrant Indian group. However, no relationship could be established at the DR locus.

They revealed a profound change in dietary habits since their arrival in Israel, with consumption of large amounts of refined carbohydrate in place of spicy stews and injura (Ethiopian pita) that had constituted dietary staples in better times in Ethiopia. According to National Diabetes Data Group criteria, 14 (8.9%) of the subjects had diabetes, and another 14 (8.9%) had impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, 13 subjects had a dramatic increase in capillary blood glucose levels (greater than 300 mg/dl) 1 h after ingestion of 75 g glucose, despite fasting and 2-h values well within the normal range, and they complained of associated symptoms during the 1st h of testing. Eleven of 137 men and 3 of 21 women had diabetes; 7 (5.1%) of the men and 7 (33%) of the women had impaired glucose tolerance. These results indicate a high prevalence of diabetes among young adult Ethiopian immigrants of relatively short residency in Israel, for which the factors responsible warrant further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia frequently develop atherosclerosis. Because superoxide (O2-) is suspected to play an important role in the initiation of atherosclerosis, we investigated whether an abnormal amount of O2- was produced by circulating mononuclear cells of patients with both diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia. The rate of production of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable O2- was measured when cells were stimulated by either 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) or by opsonized zymosan (OZ). In addition, the rates of O2- production by mononuclear cells drawn from three other groups (normal, solely diabetic, and solely hypertriglyceridemic) were determined. We found that the rate of O2- production by mononuclear cells from the diabetic hypertriglyceridemic group was significantly higher than that from normal, diabetic, and hypertriglyceridemic groups. When the rates of O2- production by mononuclear cells were plotted against the levels of plasma triglyceride for all individuals tested, they correlated positively (r = .73 in PMA stimulation and r = .79 in OZ stimulation, P less than .01). However, the rate of O2- production did not relate to other parameters, i.e., plasma cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1 level in erythrocytes, and the molar ratio of free cholesterol to phospholipid in mononuclear cells. Thus, we concluded that the observed elevated rate of O2- production in the diabetic hypertriglyceridemic mononuclear cells was a reflection of a hypertriglyceridemic condition and was not unique to the diabetic hypertriglyceridemic condition. Also, O2- may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in diabetic hypertriglyceridemic patients when atherogenic factors specific to diabetes are concomitantly present.\r"

Echocardiographic findings were related to the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE). In the diabetes group, fractional shortening of the left ventricle (FS) was 37.3% versus 34.3% (P less than .01) in the control group, whereas indices of preload and afterload were at the same levels as in control subjects. In diabetic patients with preclinical nephropathy (UAE 20-200 micrograms/min), FS was 41.1% compared to 37.0% (P less than .002) in patients with no signs of nephropathy (UAE less than 20 micrograms/min) and 34.8% (P less than .001) in patients with clinical nephropathy (UAE less than 200 micrograms/min). Furthermore, in patients with preclinical nephropathy, afterload was significantly decreased, whereas preload was at the same level as in the other two groups of UAE. In conclusion, a condition of cardiac hyperfunction has been found in diabetic patients with no signs of ischemic heart disease and seems pronounced in diabetic patients developing microvascular disease (patients with preclinical nephropathy), probably secondarily to a condition of hyperperfusion in these patients.\r"

We have tested the hypothesis that browning and cross-linking can occur in vivo in rats by feeding them a diet containing 33% galactose. No significant increase in tail tendon browning or cross-linking, measured by tail tendon breaking time in urea, was observed after 3 mo of galactosemia. After 12 mo, however, twofold increases in tendon breaking time and collagen-linked chromophores absorbing greater than 300 nm and fluorophores at 430 nm (excitation 355 nm, P less than .001) analogous to those of diabetic and aging individuals were observed. The observed changes in collagen are attributed to the advanced Maillard (nonenzymatic glycosylation) reaction based on circumstantial evidence. With this premise, our data suggest that chronic galactosemia should be a powerful tool for investigating the role of the advanced Maillard reaction in complications of diabetes and aging.\r"

Because MA diabetic subjects have greater hyperglycemia and an earlier age of onset than NHW diabetic subjects, we postulated that diabetic MAs might also have more severe diabetic retinopathy. Stereoscopic retinal photographs of the seven standard fields of each eye were taken in 257 MAs and 56 NHWs with NIDDM. The photographs were read by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photographic Reading Center and graded with standardized criteria. The MAs had a nonsignificantly increased risk of retinopathy relative to the NHWs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.71; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = (0.93, 3.17)]. The risk of severe retinopathy (proliferative or preproliferative) relative to background or no retinopathy was significantly greater in MAs than in NHWs [OR = 2.37; 95% Cl = (1.04, 5.39)]. After control by logistic regression for duration of disease, severity of hyperglycemia, age, and systolic blood pressure, MAs still had an increased risk of severe retinopathy relative to NHWs [OR = 3.18; 95% Cl = (1.32, 7.66)]. Severe retinopathy was related to duration of disease, hyperglycemia, and insulin therapy in both ethnic groups. Previously diagnosed MA diabetic subjects also had an increased prevalence of any retinopathy [OR = 2.39; 95% Cl = (1.63, 3.50)] and severe retinopathy [OR = 3.21; 95% Cl = (2.24, 4.59)] relative to previously diagnosed White diabetic subjects (n = 896) from Wisconsin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Second, adult epithelium was challenged by placing it between adult stroma and fetal mesenchyme to investigate the epithelial response (subsequently called challenge grafts). Trypsin was used to isolate adult mouse (heteroplastic) or rat (homoplastic) pancreatic ductal epithelium and fetal rat mesenchyme. All the adult epithelium was maximally stressed with alloxan to control for beta-cell contamination. Fetal mesenchyme was layered with epithelium in vitro for at least 48 h. Subsequently, the recombinants were grafted into nude mice and allowed to develop for 4-6 wk. To assess development, grafts were removed and fixed for both light and electron microscopy. In general, the grafts became organized into vesicles, tubules, and buds, many of which were in the form of vascularized isletlike structures. Epithelium responded with mitosis and intercellular adhesion. the range of cytodifferentiation varied. Culture time, age, and adhesiveness of the fetal mesenchyme and the amount of adult epithelium used in making the recombinants influenced the degree of differentiation. Analysis of fine structure of isletlike structures revealed cells with small electron-dense granules. These observations provide evidence for activation of endodermal epithelium taken from an adult mammal.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction. Accordingly, the effects of verapamil, a Ca2+ antagonist, on cardiac function, ultrastructure, and high-energy phosphate stores in the myocardium were evaluated in rats made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Four weeks after the induction of diabetes, the animals were treated with three doses (2, 4, or 8 mg.kg-1.day-1) of verapamil for 4 wk until they were used for the measurement of different parameters. Untreated diabetic animals had slower heart rates, depressed rate of contraction and rate of relaxation, lower peak left ventricular systolic pressure, and elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure. All of these changes were significantly improved in diabetic rats receiving verapamil treatment. The beneficial effects of verapamil were more evident with higher doses (8 mg.kg-1.day-1) than with the lower doses (2 mg.kg-1.day-1). The diabetic animals also showed alterations in myocardial high-energy phosphate stores and exhibited evidence of ultrastructural damage; these abnormalities were improved by verapamil treatment without affecting their hyperglycemic status. Our results demonstrate that verapamil is capable of preventing diabetes-induced myocardial changes and support the involvement of Ca2+ in the cardiac pathology during diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were done to characterize the bladder dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus and to distinguish between changes occurring from increased diuresis and autonomic neuropathy. Four experimental conditions were compared: control, 4-wk-streptozocin-induced diabetes, sucrose feeding (diuretic), and galactose feeding (diuretic and sugar alcohol). A 10-fold increase in urine output and 25-50% increases in bladder weight, protein content, and DNA content were observed in all noncontrol treatment groups. Compliance properties were studied by measuring the intravesicular pressure as the bladder was infused with buffer in vitro. All treated bladders exhibited a reduction in plateau pressure and an increase in fluid capacity. Thus, diuresis results in an increased bladder size, which correlates with an alteration of compliance properties. Nervous system control in anesthetized rats was examined by monitoring contractions as the bladder was infused with buffer. Three distinct patterns of response were observed: normal, diabetic, and diuretic (galactose and sucrose treatments). The difference between responses in diuretic and diabetic animals suggests the presence of a diabetes-induced alteration in nerve regulation of the bladder. Reserpine pretreatment of control or diuretic models produced marked changes in the pattern of contractions, whereas pretreatment of diabetic rats had only modest effects. This suggests that diabetic bladders were lacking sympathetic control before the drug treatment. When rats treated for 4 wk with galactose were removed from this diet for 4 wk before testing, the bladders responded similarly to controls. This observation, coupled with the fact that galactose did not produce the same response as diabetes in the in vivo experiment, suggests that the galactose model does not produce irreversible functional neuropathies.\r"

Dopamine and serotonin release from rat striatum was studied at a short-term or acute (3-day) interval and a long-term or chronic (3- to 7-wk) interval after the induction of diabetes. The study was also done in age-, sex-, and food-matched controls. The findings show that L-tryptophan decreased dopamine release from rat striatum in nondiabetic rats. The decreased striatal dopamine release, after L-tryptophan administration, was exacerbated in acutely diabetic rats and further exacerbated in chronically diabetic rats. By contrast, rat striatal serotonin release predictably increased after L-tryptophan injection in nondiabetic rats. A further increased striatal serotonin release was seen in acutely diabetic rats. Chronically diabetic rats, however, responded to L-tryptophan with a dramatic and significant decrease in striatal serotonin release. The results show that in acutely diabetic and normal rats, L-tryptophan administration reduced striatal dopamine and increased striatal serotonin release, whereas in chronically diabetic rats, the release of both biogenic amines was decreased. The findings indicate that the progression of diabetes is associated with an impaired ability to release primary neurotransmitter biogenic amines.\r"

After an overnight fast and maintenance of normoglycemia, 12 insulin-treated diabetic patients with and 11 without neuropathy and 12 nondiabetic control subjects, all less than 55 yr, were subjected to external cooling by perfusing water at 16 degrees C through a liquid-conditioned coverall for less than or equal to 45 min. Patients with autonomic neuropathy had impaired vasoconstriction to cooling, particularly in the foot, calf, and forearm. Core temperature rose by 0.2 degrees C in control subjects and by 0.15 degrees C in patients with diabetes but no neuropathy. In contrast, group mean core temperature was unchanged in those with autonomic neuropathy and fell in 3 subjects (P less than .001). Cooling caused shivering in 6 patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, but not in those with neuropathy or control subjects (P less than .05). Baseline metabolic rates were similar in all three groups, but the increase after cooling was significantly greater among those who shivered (P less than .05-.02). Thus, young diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy have impaired thermoregulation to a relatively short period of external cooling, even during metabolic stability, which may predispose to hypothermia.\r"

Neither gestational age nor maternal diabetes affected the tissue's energy potential (ATP-to-ADP and PCr-to-Cr ratios). Diabetes resulted in a fourfold rise in the embryonic glucose and a 25% increase in neuroectodermal malate content. Maternal hyperglycemia caused a rise in fetal sorbitol at days 11 and 12 of gestation. The MI content of the neuroectoderm was not affected by the maternal diabetic state in perfusion embryos (day 11); however, the near doubling of MI that occurs from day 11 to day 12 during normal development was prevented. Thus, embryos isolated from diabetic mothers on gestation day 12 had 30% less MI than embryos isolated from normal mothers. From these data we conclude that a rise in tissue sorbitol is not always accompanied by a fall in tissue MI. These results and recent information in the literature implicate involvement of decreased MI concentrations in the process leading to malformation of the nervous system in diabetic embryopathy.\r"

Non-specific and atypical presentations make the diagnosis even more difficult and a low threshold for obtaining laboratory testing is advised. Thyrotoxicosis may present with only anorexia, weight loss, and cardiac dysfunction. Hyperglycemia often remains undetected; long-term sequelae, however, may impair function and result in problems such as neuropathy, postural instability, and nephropathy--conditions often dismissed as consequences of old age. Hypercalcemia may not present with the classic findings of renal colic, GI pathology, and skeletal disease. An acute confusional state with or without volume depletion appears to be a more frequent presentation during later life.\r"

We studied the effect and mechanism of action of oral administration of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn) (20 mg), which, unlike the dinitrate, does not require hepatic biotransformation to a vasoactive metabolite on portal and systemic haemodynamics in 11 patients with portal hypertension complicating cirrhosis. A significant reduction in portal pressure gradient (WHVP-FHVP) (from 23.9 (3.4) to 21.8 (3.4) mmHg: p less than 0.005) occurred 60 minutes after Is-5-Mn due entirely to a fall in WHVP, associated with decreased estimated liver blood flow (from 1940 (159) to 1639 (179) ml/min: p less than 0.05). Right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac index fell significantly whilst mean arterial pressure remained unaffected. Heart rate and the calculated systemic vascular resistance index increased significantly. Significant correlations existed between the reduction in portal pressure gradient and fall in cardiac index (r = 0.65, p less than 0.05) and increase in systemic vascular resistance index (r = 0.72, p less than 0.02). The observed decrease in estimated liver blood flow, in association with an increase in systemic vascular resistance index, suggests that baroreceptor mediated splanchnic vasoconstriction may be one of the factors responsible for the fall in portal pressure, rather than portal venous dilatation.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty one patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 18 with idiopathic faecal incontinence and 11 normal controls were studied with techniques of mucosal electrosensitivity, rectal distension for the quantitative assessment of anorectal sensation, and manometric and electromyographic tests for the assessment of anorectal motor function. An asymptomatic sensorimotor deficit was found in the anal canal of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Mucosal electrosensitivity thresholds in the anal canal were significantly higher (p less than 0.01 v controls) and fibre density of the external anal sphincter significantly raised (p less than 0.0001 v controls). Anal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies were similar to controls. In patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence the tests of sensory and motor function also showed a sensorimotor neuropathy; compared with controls, mucosal electrosensitivity thresholds were significantly higher (p less than 0.002), anal canal resting and maximum squeeze pressures were significantly lower (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.002 respectively), and pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies and fibre density of the external anal sphincter were significantly raised (both p less than 0.05). Sensory thresholds to rectal distension were similar in all groups. Pelvic floor sensorimotor neuropathy in diabetic patients has several features in common with that of patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence but its functional significance remains uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of regulatory peptides was studied in the separated mucosa, submucosa and muscularis externa taken at 10 sampling sites encompassing the whole human sigmoid colon (five sites), rectum (two sites), and anal canal (three sites). Consistently high concentrations of VIP were measured in the muscle layer at most sites (proximal sigmoid: 286 (16) pmol/g, upper rectum: 269 (17), a moderate decrease being found in the distal smooth sphincter (151 (30) pmol/g). Values are expressed as mean (SE). Conversely, substance P concentrations showed an obvious decline in the recto-anal muscle (mid sigmoid: 19 (2.0) pmol/g, distal rectum: 7.1 (1.3), upper anal canal: 1.6 (0.6)). Somatostatin was mainly present in the sigmoid mucosa and submucosa (37 (9.3) and 15 (3.5) pmol/g, respectively) and showed low, but consistent concentrations in the muscle (mid sigmoid: 2.2 (0.7) pmol/g, upper anal canal: 1.5 (0.8]. Starting in the distal sigmoid colon, a distinct peak of tissue NPY was revealed, which was most striking in the muscle (of mid sigmoid: 16 (3.9) pmol/g, upper rectum: 47 (7.8), anal sphincter: 58 (14)). Peptide YY was confined to the mucosa and showed an earlier peak (upper sigmoid: 709 (186) pmol/g, mid-distal sigmoid: 1965 (484)). A clear differential distribution of regulatory peptides was thus shown in the region studied. A possible role is suggested for NPY and VIP containing nerves in the effector control of the human internal anal sphincter.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure activity in the rectum and anal canal was measured with a multilumen probe in 29 patients with ulcerative colitis (12 active, 11 quiescent, six studied during both phases) and 18 normal controls under resting conditions and during rectal infusion of saline. Resting motor activity was significantly decreased in patients with active colitis compared with quiescent colitis (p less than 0.005) and normal controls (p less than 0.001). Forty per cent of active colitics showed a featureless record compared with only one patient with quiescent colitis and one normal subject. The volume of saline infused before leakage occurred, and the total volume retained were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in patients with active and quiescent colitis compared with normal controls. Rectal infusion of saline provoked regular rectal contractions, of significantly higher (p less than 0.05) amplitude in patients with active colitis, than in quiescent colitis or controls. These rectal contractions were associated with simultaneous anal relaxations. During saline infusion, peak and pressures were lower in patients with ulcerative colitis than in normal subjects, but there were no significant differences in relaxation pressures. In normal subjects, the rectal pressures remained below the anal pressures throughout the saline infusion. Peak rectal pressures exceeded the anal relaxation pressures during the last five minutes of saline infusion in patients with ulcerative colitis and throughout the infusion in those patients who complained of incontinence. Results suggest that although the resting rectal motor activity is diminished in patients with ulcerative colitis, luminal distension causes the inflamed rectum to generate abnormally strong contractions that may threaten continence.\r"

Overall mortality fell from 14.9% in the early half of the study to 10.8% in the latter half although in the 73 patients in whom the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made during life, the mortality rate was unchanged throughout. Within the group of 73 patients diagnosed during life deaths from gall stone pancreatitis have fallen by almost 50% suggesting that improved treatment of this subgroup may have occurred. The findings of this study lend support to the concept of early, complete clearance of calculi from the biliary tree, either by an endoscopic or surgical approach.\r"

Glycochenodeoxycholic acid at a concentration of 15 mmol/l (total amount: 5 mmol) and glycocholic acid 15 mmol/l (total amount: 5 mmol), both with lecithin 2.5 mmol/l, delayed (p less than 0.02) small bowel transit when compared with a bile acid free infusion [158.3 (12.5) min v 111.7 (17.6) min and 103.3 (21.8) min v 70.0 (14.9) min], inhibited (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05 respectively) the percentage duration of pressure activity of phase 2 [13.1 (1.8)% v 28.1 (3.4)% and 29.2 (5.5)% v 34.9 (3.9)%], but did not change duration of migrating motor complex, or of its phases. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid 10 mmol/l (total amount: 3.3 mmol), either with or without lecithin, did not delay small bowel transit significantly [145.0 (13.2) min v 115.0 (19.5) and 90.0 (11.7) min v 84.0 (8.3)]. When bile acids were infused, serum bile acid curves were similar to those obtained after a liquid meal and the peak serum bile acid concentration occurred 33.7 (6.6) min before (p less than 0.001) completion of small bowel transit. These observations suggest a role for endogenous bile acids in the regulation of small gut motility.\r"

  ".W": "The human enteric protozoan, Giardia lamblia, has surface membrane lectin activity which mediates parasite adherence to erythrocytes. To determine whether an intestinal binding site exists for this lectin we have studied the interaction in vitro between axenically cultured Giardia trophozoites and isolated rat intestinal epithelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy showed that Giardia attached to the apical microvillus membrane and basolateral membrane of rat enterocytes. Any location on the parasite surface could mediate attachment without predeliction for the ventral disc. Trophozoites attached more avidly to jejunal compared with colonic epithelial cells. Attachment was inhibited at 4 degrees C, by sugars and glycoproteins containing D-mannosyl residues and by subagglutinating concentrations of anti-Giardia rabbit serum and two monoclonal antibodies, all with reactivity to parasite surface membrane determinants. Trypsinisation of trophozoites also reduced attachment but the ability to attach was rapidly restored after returning trophozoites to TYI-S culture medium for 4 h at 37 degrees C. Attachment was unaltered by the presence of the microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin B and in the absence of Ca++ and Mg++ ions. These findings support previous work that Giardia possesses a surface membrane mannose binding lectin and indicate that appropriate binding sites are present on rat intestinal epithelial cells. This lectin may play a part in mediating adherence of Giardia to mammalian intestine and could be a target for host immune defence.\r"

The respective per cent increases in the residual proximal small intestine compared with their respective untreated controls were: protein, R = 60%, S = 66%; DNA, R = 69%, S = 29%; maltase, R = 57%, S = 5%. The uptake of leucine by intestinal rings was significantly higher (50%) in the PGE treated group at a concentration of 2 mmol/l of substrate, while the uptake of glucose was similar in all groups. The drug appears to be an effective agent in stimulating morphological and functional adaptation after massive distal small bowel resection.\r"

The soya beans were fed either whole or pureed to test the effect of physical form of food. Total N, protein, amino acids, urea, and ammonia were measured in ileostomy effluent which was collected throughout the study. Total N excretion was LND 0.91 (0.04) (SE) g/day; LND + whole soya beans (WSB) 2.26 (0.15) g/day; LND + pureed soya beans (PSB) 1.42 (0.12) g/day (WSB v PSB, p less than 0.001); and HFD 2.17 (0.11) g/day (HFD v PSB, p less than 0.001, HFD v WSB, NS). N losses as urea, ammonia, and free amino acids were less than 10-15% of total N, the remainder being protein (48-51%) and (by difference) peptides (20-30%). Eighty to 85% of effluent N was in the insoluble (pellet) fraction except on the low N diet where it was 66%. The physical form of food clearly influenced N digestibility in the soya beans whilst changes in dietary fibre seem not to have a significant effect.\r"

After exercise, water, sodium, and chloride absorption returned towards basal values, but potassium absorption remained significantly decreased. These results suggest that moderate exercise can influence jejunal absorption of salt and water in man. They support the possibility that the autonomic nervous system has a physiological role in the control of intestinal transport, although other mechanisms may be involved.\r"

Systemic and coronary hemodynamics were determined by using radioactive microspheres in conscious, unrestrained rats. Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal. Nine treated hypertensive rats were compared with control groups: 12 untreated hypertensive and nine sham-operated rats. Diltiazem treatment led to an effective but incomplete control of blood pressure (from 208 +/- 5 mm Hg in the untreated hypertensive group to 155 +/- 3 mm Hg in the treated hypertensive group; p less than 0.01) associated with a significant but incomplete decrease of the left ventricular mass (from 3.10 +/- 0.19 mg/g in untreated hypertensive rats to 2.35 +/- 0.04 mg/g in treated hypertensive rats; p less than 0.01). A close correlation was found between left ventricular mass and systolic blood pressure in untreated, treated, and pooled groups (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001, n = 30). The left ventricular weight to systolic blood pressure ratio was equivalent in all three groups, so that the reduction of left ventricular mass in diltiazem-treated rats was commensurate with the reduction of blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experimental and clinical data suggest an association between chronic hyperparathyroidism and hypertension, but acute infusion of parathyroid hormone causes vasodilation and hypotension. These observations imply that chronic and acute parathyroid states affect blood pressure through different mechanism(s), either by modification of vascular receptors or by an ionophoretic effect of parathyroid hormone. The effect of parathyroid status induced by dietary calcium manipulations or by surgical ablation of the parathyroid gland on the hypotensive response of parathyroid hormone infusion was studied in rats. At 4 weeks of age 24 male rats were divided into four equal groups. Three groups were sham-operated, and one group was thyroparathyroidectomized. Only the thyroparathyroidectomized group was treated with thyroxine, 10 micrograms/kg/day. The control and thyroparathyroidectomized groups were raised on a 1.4% calcium diet; the other two groups were raised on 0.005% and 2.8% calcium diets. After 8 weeks on the diets, parathyroid hormone was infused through a venous cannula at 5 and 10 micrograms/kg doses and blood pressure was measured through arterial cannulas. The results indicate that hyperparathyroidism and hypocalcemia induced by the low calcium diet attenuated the hypotensive response to parathyroid hormone compared with responses in rats raised on a 1.4% calcium diet. In hypoparathyroid rats (2.8% Ca diet) with hypercalcemia, the hypotensive response was also reduced. However, in hypoparathyroid (thyroparathyroidectomized) rats with hypocalcemia, the hypotensive response was enhanced. The data suggest that chronic parathyroid status, as well as hypercalcemia, alters the hypotensive response to parathyroid hormone infusion, presumably by altering the vascular parathyroid hormone receptors or by some other mechanism.\r"

We used a modified Ussing chamber to compare the NaCl dependence of the short-circuit current across the dorsal lingual epithelium in vitro from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with that from Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The short-circuit current in response to mucosal NaCl was less in SHR than in WKY at hyperosmotic concentrations (above 0.15 M and up to 2.0 M). Since ion transport in the lingual epithelium has been found to play a role in early events of salt taste transduction, the attenuation in the short-circuit current in hypertensive animals may be a factor in the enhanced salt preference of SHR compared with WKY.\r"

  ".W": "Several experimental forms of hypertension require intact renal innervation for the development or maintenance (or both) of the elevated arterial pressure. We determined the relationships between urinary sodium and water excretion and arterial pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) with innervated (n = 6) and denervated (n = 7) kidneys after switching from a low to a high sodium diet. Arterial pressure significantly increased in both groups within 48 hours after they began to eat an 8% sodium chloride diet. This hypertension increased to 188 +/- 9 and 190 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively, in rats with innervated and denervated kidneys after 12 days. Mean arterial pressures were not significantly different between groups on any day. The rise in arterial pressure of DS placed on a high sodium intake was associated with an elevation of urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretions in rats with either innervated or denervated kidneys. Urine flow rates and urinary sodium excretions were greater in denervated than in innervated rats on Days 4 through 7 after beginning the high sodium diet. This diuresis and natriuresis in rats with denervated kidneys were associated with greater water and sodium intakes on Days 4 to 7 of the high sodium diet when compared with rats with innervated kidneys. These results demonstrate that, following exposure to a high sodium intake, DS have increased arterial pressure within 24 hours. The development of this arterial hypertension is not dependent on intact renal innervation. In conscious DS, the renal innervation does participate in the regulation of urinary sodium excretion by promoting renal sodium and water reabsorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 13 normotensive young men with diastolic blood pressures below 85 mm Hg and nine borderline hypertensive young men defined by diastolic blood pressures intermittently above 90 mm Hg. The subjects achieved comparable sodium balance during 6 days of low NaCl (10 mEq Na, 40 mEq Cl, 100 mEq K) and high NaCl (400 mEq Na, 400 mEq Cl, 100 mEq K) diets. In the normotensive subjects, standing for 30 minutes resulted in a tendency for diastolic blood pressure to fall during both diets. In contrast, during standing borderline hypertensive subjects showed no change in diastolic blood pressure during the low salt diet and a tendency for diastolic blood pressure to increase after the high salt diet. Standing reduced renal plasma flow in both groups during both diets. However, only during the high NaCl diet did the absolute decrease and percent decrease in renal plasma flow during standing differ significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) between the borderline hypertensive (-151 +/- 24 ml/min/1.73m2; -29 +/- 4%) and normotensive subjects (-79 +/- 17 ml/min/1.73m2; -15 +/- 3%). The resultant increase in the renal vascular resistance index with standing did not differ between the two groups during the low NaCl diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each subject had two sets of daily ambulatory recordings, home self-measured readings (over 6 days), and clinic measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Comparisons over the 2 weeks within and among the methods of measurements were made using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. The results showed that there was no consistent average change in the ambulatory or home pressures and no change in clinic diastolic pressures, but the clinic systolic pressure of the hypertensive subjects dropped 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), while that of the normotensive subjects showed no significant change. Test-retest correlations of each of the three methods were similar in magnitude, indicating a similar level of reliability. Test-retest correlations of the ambulatory standard deviations, however, were low, indicating a low reliability of this measure of daily pressure variability. These results suggest that the reproducibility of ambulatory pressures may be as good or better than that of home or clinic measurements. They also suggest that the average ambulatory pressure may be preferable as the measurement in clinical trials, since it may be less influenced by measurement anxiety, particularly in hypertensive subjects.\r"

These patients exhibited changes in renal hemodynamics comparable to those recorded in nine healthy volunteers. The results do not support involvement of the pituitary gland in the acute renal response to amino acids.\r"

Aluminum by itself in routine culture, even at very high levels (1,035 ng/ml), did not significantly affect erythroid colony growth. The addition of human transferrin to the culture, however, resulted in a marked dose-dependent inhibition of erythroid, but not myeloid colony growth. At all doses, CFU-E progenitors showed greater inhibition than burst-forming units (BFU-E). Aluminum inhibition was not overcome by increasing the dose of erythropoietin or adding additional burst-promoting activity to the culture. Inhibition by aluminum was directly related to the number of binding sites on transferrin in the culture, and was not observed in the presence of fully iron-saturated transferrin.\r"

The amount of intracellular polymer was calculated as a function of oxygen saturation to estimate the polymerization tendency for each of eight patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Progressive reduction of oxygen tension within the arterial range caused a sudden loss of filterability of SCA erythrocytes through 5-micron-diam pores at a critical PO2 between 110 and 190 mmHg. This loss of filterability occurred at a higher PO2 than did morphological sickling, and the critical PO2 correlated significantly (r = 0.844-0.881, P less than 0.01) with the polymerization tendency for each patient. Study of density-gradient fractionated cells from four SCA patients indicated that the critical PO2 of dense cells was reached when only a small amount of polymer had formed, indicating the influence of this subpopulation on the results obtained for unfractionated cells. Impairment of erythrocyte filterability at high oxygen saturation (greater than 90%) suggests that small changes in oxygen saturation within the arterial circulation cause rheological impairment of sickle cells.\r"

Methionine biosynthesis by intact cells, as determined by incorporation of label from 5-[14C]methyl-tetrahydrofolate into acid-precipitable material, was deficient in cultured skin fibroblasts that were derived from all of these patients. In one group of patients, activity of the methylcobalamin-dependent enzyme, methionine synthase, in cell extracts was within the normal range when the enzyme was assayed under standard conditions. In a second group of patients, methionine synthase activity was decreased under the same assay conditions. Genetic complementation analysis demonstrated the existence of two complementation classes that corresponded to these two groups of patients. The designation cblE has previously been proposed for normal methionine synthase activity. We propose the designation cblG for the mutation in those patients with methylcobalamin deficiency and decreased synthase activity. The results of these studies suggest that the products of at least two loci are required for cobalamin-dependent methionine biosynthesis in mammalian cells.\r"

We therefore tested the effects of thyroid hormones on muscle bioenergetics in humans and rats, using in vivo 31P NMR. Two hypothyroid patients had: low phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio (PCr/Pi) at rest, increased PCr depletion during exercise and delayed postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi. Eight thyroidectomized rats did not show abnormalities at rest, but muscle work induced by nerve stimulation resulted in a significantly (P less than 0.0001) lower PCr/Pi (35-45% of control) at each of the three stimulation frequencies tested (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 Hz). Recovery rate was markedly slowed to one-third of normal values. Thyroxine therapy reversed these abnormalities in both human and rat muscle. Five patients and six rats with hyperthyroidism did not differ from normal controls during rest and exercise but had an unusually rapid recovery after exercise. The bioenergetic abnormalities in hypothyroid muscle suggest the existence of a hormone-dependent, reversible mitochondrial impairment in this disorder. The exercise intolerance and fatigue experienced in hypothyroid muscle may be due to such a bioenergetic impairment. The changes in energy metabolism in hyperthyroid muscle probably do not cause the muscular disease in this disorder.\r"

We therefore investigated its potential role in mediating the reduction in nephron filtration rate seen after induction of experimental nephrotoxic serum (NTS)-induced glomerulonephritis in the rat. Micropuncture measurements were performed in euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats 2 h after i.v. administration of 0.8 ml of rabbit serum (group 1, n = 6), 0.8 ml of rabbit anti-rat glomerular basement membrane antibody in the absence (group 2, n = 8), or presence (group 3, n = 7) of the new highly specific LTD4 receptor antagonist SK&F 104353. Quantitation of antibody binding and neutrophil infiltration revealed no differences between groups 2 and 3. Antagonism of endogenous LTD4 actions, however, was associated with prevention of the NTS-induced fall in SNGFR because of the abrogation of the fall in Kf which characterizes this form of experimental glomerulonephritis. Antagonism of endogenous LTD4 had no effect on the NTS-induced increases in pre- and postglomerular arteriolar resistances, and did not affect nephron plasma flow rate or net transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference. The observed highly localized protective action of the LTD4 antagonist on the glomerular capillary points to a possibly major functional role for intraglomerularly released LTD4, likely originating from infiltrating leukocytes, in the pathophysiology of this form of glomerulonephritis.\r"

Total platelet GPIb content of fresh washed platelets, determined by gel electrophoresis and immunoassay of Triton X-100 lysates, averaged 159,740 molecules per platelet. There were 36,360 surface GPIb molecules per platelet, determined by immunoassay of the supernatant of fresh washed platelets whose surface GPIb had been completely plasmin-cleaved. In summary, these studies provide evidence for (a) a redistribution of GPIb molecules with platelet storage, and (b) a large intraplatelet pool of GPIb (approximately threefold larger than the platelet surface pool of GPIb).\r"

However, the low titer and incidence of autologous antibody to melanoma have hampered further evaluation. By utilizing acid dissociation and ultrafiltration of serum, we have been able to augment the detectable autologous immune response to melanoma in the majority of patients studied. In autologous system Y-Mel 84:420, serum S150 demonstrated a rise in titer from 1:32 in native sera to 1:262,044 after dissociation. The antigen detected by S150 was found to be broadly represented on melanoma, glioma, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and head and neck carcinoma cell lines. It did not react with bladder or colon carcinoma, fetal fibroblasts, pooled platelets, lymphocytes and red blood cells, or autologous cultured lymphocytes. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, S150 detects a 66,000-mol wt antigen in spent tissue culture media and serum ultrafiltrate. In cell lysate two bands between 20,000 and 30,000 mol wt are detected by S150. The 66,000-mol wt antigen is sensitive to trypsin digestion and but is resistant to pepsin and heat inactivation. Exposure of spent media to trypsin results in the development of a 24,000-mol wt band that appears to correspond to the antigen detected in the cell lysate. The difference between the antigens detected in the cell lysate as compared with spent media and serum ultrafiltrate may be due to degradation during cell lysis. We conclude that melanoma-associated antigens are present in the serum of patients with melanoma and are shed or secreted by their tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "In atherosclerotic rabbits (SCLER), decreases in vascular resistance in response to acetylcholine (ACH), an endothelium-dependent agent, are suppressed, whereas those to nitroprusside (NP), an endothelium-independent vasodilator, are preserved. To determine whether defective vasodilation in SCLER is related to altered reactivity of resistance vessels, we visualized arterioles of rabbit cremaster muscle by videomicroscopy. Arteriolar diameter was monitored during topical (superfusional) delivery of ACh and NO, interventions that did not affect systemic hemodynamics. Diameter changes in response to NP (0.01-100.0 microM) did not differ between SCLER and controls; maximal dilations amounted to 110 +/- 10% (mean +/- SE). In contrast, responses to ACH (0.001-100 microM) differed; maximal dilations averaged 54 +/- 4% in SCLER and 124 +/- 9% in controls (P less than 0.001). These differences persisted after blockade with phentolamine, propranolol, and indomethacin. Phenidone and hydroquinone blockers of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inhibited arteriolar dilation to ACH without affecting that to NP. Microvascular responses to intra-arterial drug were similar to those elicited by topical drug. Thus, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the rabbit appear to produce a microvascular defect characterized by an impaired endothelium-dependent dilation and a preserved endothelium-independent dilation. This defect could play a role in limiting vasodilator reserve in atherosclerosis.\r"

Densitometric analysis was used to measure body composition. Preprandial and postprandial energy expenditures were measured by indirect calorimetry. The data show that the thermic effect of food was linearly correlated with caloric intake, and that the magnitude and duration of augmented postprandial thermogenesis increased linearly with caloric consumption. Postprandial energy expenditures over resting metabolic requirements were indistinguishable when comparing lean and obese men for a given caloric intake. Individuals, however, had distinct and consistent thermic responses to progressively greater caloric challenges. These unique thermic profiles to food ingestion were also independent of leanness or obesity. We conclude that the thermic effect of food increases linearly with caloric intake, and is independent of leanness and obesity.\r"

The incidence of fracture was then fitted to a log-linear model in age and bone mass. It was found that incidence of fracture increased with both increasing age and decreasing radius bone mass. When subsets of fractures were examined it was found that age was a stronger predictor of hip fractures, whereas midshaft radius bone mass was a stronger predictor of fractures at the distal forearm. We concluded that bone mass is a useful predictor of fractures but that other age-related factors associated with fractures need to be identified.\r"

Immediately after the surgical creation of aortic insufficiency, both young and old rats showed similar elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure (from 4.8 +/- 0.6 to 12.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg in the young rats, P less than 0.01; from 4.9 +/- 0.4 to 11.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg in the old rats, P less than 0.01). In the young rats LV, end-diastolic pressure decreased to 8.0 +/- 1.0 and to 8.5 +/- 0.9 mmHg at 2 and 4 wk (P less than 0.05). In contrast, LV end-diastolic pressure at 2 (16.9 +/- 3.1 mmHg) and 4 wk (16.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg) in the old rats was even higher, compared with the values measured immediately after aortic insufficiency. At 4 wk, LV end-diastolic meridional wall stress (calculated from the in vivo LV end-diastolic pressure, and the pressure-volume relationship and muscle mass obtained after killing) was higher in the old rats than in the young rats. In the young rats, the diastolic pressure-volume relationship at 4 wk shifted to the right (P less than 0.01), and LV dry weight, LV dry weight/tibial length, and protein content of the LV myocardium increased by 26% (P less than 0.01), 24% (P less than 0.01), and 33% (P less than 0.01), respectively. However, old rats with aortic insufficiency did not show a significant change in the pressure-volume relationship, dry weight, or protein content at 4 wk. These results suggest that advanced age diminishes the capacity for LV hypertrophy in response to a volume overload, and this reduced LV hypertrophic response in the old rats resulted in persistent elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure and wall stress.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed microperfusion studies on distal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption (JtCO2) of fed and fasted rats to extend our previous observations of in vivo bicarbonate secretion and to resolve certain discrepancies between free-flow and microperfusion data. When rats are fasted overnight, as in previous free-flow studies, distal tubule microperfusion with a 28-mM tCO2 solution results in significant JtCO2 (53 +/- 6 pmol.min-1.mm-1) at normal flow and increases briskly (91 +/- 16 pmol.min-1.mm-1) with bicarbonate load. This response is not influenced by the addition of other normal tubular fluid constituents. However, when normally fed rats are used, as in our previous microperfusion studies, distal tubule JtCO2 is not different from zero when a 28-mM tCO2 solution is perfused at normal flow rates but becomes negative (-54 +/- 13 pmol.min-1.mm-1) at high flow rates, which indicates the existence of bicarbonate secretion against a concentration gradient. Alkali loading of fasted rats also elicits bicarbonate secretion at high flow. These results demonstrate for the first time that normal feeding or alkali loading can induce bicarbonate secretion in a mammalian nephron segment in vivo, and resolves previous discrepancies between free-flow and microperfusion data.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluates the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) relaxes the sphincter of Oddi via vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Isolated canine sphincter of Oddi were suspended in organ baths under standard conditions. Responses to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and VIP were recorded on a pen recorder via an isometric transducer. 10(-11)-10(-7) M CCK-8 and 4 X 10(-11)-5 X 10(-7) M VIP generated dose-related sphincter of Oddi relaxation, which was unaffected by atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine. The effect of CCK-8 was antagonized by dibutyryl cGMP (Bt2 cGMP) (10(-3) M), the VIP-antagonist (N-Ac-Tyr1, D-Phe2)-growth hormone-releasing factor-(1-29)-NH2, and abolished by tetrodotoxin. In contrast, VIP's relaxing action was tetrodotoxin insensitive. 10(-11)-10(-7) M CCK-8 stimulated dose-dependent release of VIP (0.5-2.2 fm/ml.mg tissue), which was not inhibited by atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine, but was antagonized by 10(-3) M Bt2 cGMP and tetrodotoxin. In addition CCK-8 and VIP generated dose-related (10(-10)-10(-7) M) increases in sphincter of Oddi cAMP levels that were not affected by atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine. Furthermore, 10(-5)-10(-2) M 8-bromo-cAMP caused dose-dependent relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. In separate studies, a 2-h incubation in physiological solution containing 12 parts/1,000 of rabbit VIP antiserum antagonized sphincter relaxation caused by 4 nM CCK-8 and 6 nM VIP. The antiserum also significantly decreased the sphincter of Oddi cAMP level stimulated by 4 nM CCK-8 by 48 +/- 15%. These studies demonstrate that CCK-8 relaxes the canine sphincter of Oddi via a noncholinergic, nonadrenergic neural pathway involving VIP. The intracellular mechanism mediating CCK/VIP relaxation involves generation of cAMP.\r"

To examine the role of one such substance, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in mediating LPS-induced injury, we employed a rabbit model of endotoxic shock to (a) determine the kinetics and extent of release of TNF into plasma after injection of LPS, and (b) to evaluate the protective effect of in vivo neutralization of LPS-induced TNF by prior infusion of anti-TNF antibody. TNF was maximally induced 45-100 min after injection of 10 micrograms i.v. parent Salmonella minnesota Re595 LPS or 250 micrograms Re595 LPS-HDL complexes. Maximal induction of TNF by LPS was associated with development of hypotension, focal hepatic necrosis, intravascular fibrin deposition and lethality. Based on (a) the peak levels of TNF observed in serum, 2.5 X 10(3) U/ml, (b) the specific activity of purified rabbit macrophage-derived TNF, 1 X 10(8) U/mg, and (c) the biphasic disappearance of intravenously injected purified TNF (t1/2 = 0.5 min, 11 min) we constructed a kinetic model showing that at least 130 micrograms of TNF (1.3 X 10(7) U) was released into plasma 30-200 min postinjection of LPS. Prior infusion of anti-TNF antibody (30-45 min before LPS injection) resulted in neutralization of the LPS-induced serum TNF activity and provided significant protection from the development of hypotension, fibrin deposition, and lethality. Thus, these results provide further evidence that TNF plays a central role mediating the pathophysiologic changes that occur during gram negative endotoxic shock.\r"

We measured intracellular sodium activity with ion-selective electrodes during a 15-min period of calcium reperfusion in isolated ferret papillary muscles. During the calcium-free period, alpha Nai increased from 9.0 +/- 0.9 to 18.9 +/- 4.3 mM. With reinstitution of calcium there was a significant contracture. The amount of contracture after calcium reinstitution was related to sodium loading during the calcium-free period. We were unable to block sodium entry during the calcium-free period with either nitrendipine, tetrodotoxin, or low concentrations of amiloride. 10(-3) M amiloride or lithium for sodium substitution in the calcium-free period, however, obliterated the increase in alpha Nai activity and the subsequent paradox. These data suggest that sodium loading is a necessary prerequisite for the calcium paradox and that one mechanism of sodium entry is through Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Under these conditions, no increase in the rest force is seen without previous sodium gains, suggesting that sodium-dependent calcium exchange is an important trigger for the calcium reflow, the calcium paradox.\r"

  ".W": "The integrins, a family of related membrane receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, are heterodimeric complexes of alpha and beta subunits. To begin to understand the evolution of these complexes, we studied the genomic organization of several alpha and beta integrin subunits. Using both somatic cell hybrids and an in situ hybridization technique, we have determined the chromosomal location of the genes for the alpha subunits of the vitronectin receptor (VNR alpha), the fibronectin receptor (FNR alpha), and for the alpha subunit of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, GPIIb. In addition, we have determined the chromosomal location of the gene for the beta subunit of the GPIIb/IIIa heterodimer, GPIIIa. Our studies indicate that the alpha subunits do not localize to a single locus, but that each is found on a different chromosome. The gene for VNR alpha is located on chromosome 2, the gene for FNR alpha is on chromosome 12q11----13, and the gene for GPIIb is on chromosome 17q21----23. In contrast to the chromosomal dispersion of the alpha subunits, the genes for GPIIb and GPIIIa are physically close, with the gene for GPIIIa also located on chromosome 17q21----23. These studies indicate that the genes for the alpha subunits of the integrin family have been dispersed during evolution while GPIIb and GPIIIa are in close physical proximity. This physical proximity of GPIIb and GPIIIa may be involved in the concurrent expression of these proteins by megakaryocytes, and may result in linkage disequilibrium between these two genes, which would limit the use of restriction length polymorphisms in linkage studies of GPIIb/IIIa abnormalities in small kindreds.\r"

Analysis of her erythroid progenitors showed the presence of erythropoietin-independent progenitors before, during, and after her pregnancy, consistent with a diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, and persistence of the abnormal clone throughout the period of study. Analysis of DNA from her blood granulocytes showed these to be polyclonal at mid-pregnancy, when her platelet count had decreased to normal values, in comparison to the monoclonal pattern exhibited by her blood granulocytes 3 mo postpartum, when her platelet count was again elevated. These results demonstrate a partial conversion to normal, polyclonal hemopoiesis during her pregnancy and suggest a previously unanticipated differential sensitivity of normal and neoplastic hemopoietic cells to physiological changes associated with this state.\r"

Using a probe representing the coding region of the human PTH-like peptide, we examined by Northern analysis poly (A)+ RNA from a variety of human and animal tumors associated with HHM. Hybridizing transcripts were identified in mRNA from each of 12 human and each of four animal HHM-associated tumors, with a complex hybridization pattern observed in the human mRNAs and a relatively simple pattern observed in the animal mRNAs. Poly (A)+ RNA prepared from tumors of similar histological types unassociated with HHM failed to hybridize with the probe. Messenger RNA-dependent biological activity from the animal tumors was entirely eliminated in a hybridization-arrest experiment using a complementary oligonucleotide spanning the region of homology between human PTH and the PTH-like peptide. These findings indicate that the PTH-like peptide is associated with the syndrome of HHM in a wide spectrum of tumor types from a variety of mammalian species and that the PTH-like sequence in the proximal amino terminus of the peptide is highly conserved.\r"

The present study was designed to determine if enhanced CCK secretion is associated with increases in intestinal CCK mRNA levels. Rats, prepared with indwelling intraduodenal cannulae, were first fed an elemental diet that did not stimulate CCK release. Next, as a means of stimulating CCK secretion, soybean trypsin inhibitor was perfused for up to 24 h. Trypsin inhibitor administration increased plasma CCK levels from 0.9 +/- 0.1 to approximately 5 pmol/liter. RNA was prepared from the proximal small intestine at various times after trypsin inhibitor perfusion and mRNA levels analyzed by hybridization with a CCK cDNA probe. After 12 and 24 h of trypsin inhibitor treatment there were three- and fourfold increases, respectively, in CCK mRNA levels. In comparison, there was no change in beta-actin mRNA levels. To determine if regulation of CCK mRNA was at the level of CCK gene transcription, labeled transcripts from nuclear run-on incubations were hybridized to immobilized CCK cDNA. In trypsin inhibitor-treated rats, a two- to threefold increase in transcriptional activity was observed, whereas beta-actin gene transcription levels were unaltered. These studies indicate that stimulation of CCK secretion is associated with an increase in intestinal CCK mRNA content resulting from an increase in CCK gene transcription.\r"

EBV-transformed lymphocytes from this patient exhibited markedly reduced binding of 125I-insulin. Radioiodination of cell surface receptors followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies revealed the presence of increased amounts of a 210-kD protein but no detectable alpha or beta subunits. Continuous labeling with 2-[3H]mannose revealed the synthesis of a 190-kD precursor and a 210-kD protein. The 210-kD protein was phosphorylated in an insulin-dependent manner at high insulin concentrations. These results suggest that in this patient the biosynthesis of 190-kD receptor precursor, its terminal glycosylation, and intracellular transport to the cell surface proceed normally, while proteolytic maturation to alpha and beta subunits does not occur. We postulate that this defect either results from mutation(s) within the insulin-receptor gene, which render the precursor resistant to cleavage, or from a defect in the receptor processing enzyme.\r"

Women with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of less than 83fl were examined further, and the reliability of various red cell indices as screening tests was assessed and compared. Over three years 696 women were found to be microcytic and were investigated further. If no abnormal haemoglobin was found by cellulose acetate electrophoresis at alkaline pH, haemoglobin A2 estimation was performed. Beta thalassaemia trait was diagnosed in 56 (8%) of the microcytic women. Both the MCV and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) were found to be suitable screening tests for detecting patients who required further investigation. Women found to have beta thalassaemia trait or a functionally equivalent disorder were of varied ethnic origins. Of 58 such women, partners were investigated in 45 instances, and three pregnancies at risk of beta thalassaemia major were identified. Investigations for beta thalassaemia trait should preferably be carried out before pregnancy but for those already pregnant investigation should be carried out, irrespective of whether the patient seems to be iron deficient. It is advisable that partners of women with beta thalassaemia trait have hemoglobin electrophoresis, whatever their red cell indices, as double heterozygosity for either haemoglobin S or haemoglobin E and beta thalassaemia may produce severe disease.\r"

A spectrum of patterns was found from multiple pathognomonic ileal mucosal diaphragms to broad strictures similar to those seen as a complication of enteric potassium. It seems likely that the formation of diaphragm lesions requires an additional factor, but what is not known as yet is whether the effects of NSAID are local or systemic.\r"

The tumours were stained using a silver colloid method for nucleolar organiser regions (NORs), and the mean number of NORs for every 200 cells was calculated. The correlation between the mean number of NORs and histology and survival was studied. There was a significant correlation between the mean numbers of NORs and differentiation, and with the mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI) in the stroma poor group (p = 0.01-0.001). A trend to increased survival with decreased numbers of NORs was observed in the study group as a whole (rank order of correlation = -0.57, p = 0.05-0.02). It is suggested that mean number of NORs is of prognostic value in neuroblastomas.\r"

Cytological diagnosis of malignancy was made before biopsy in 24 patients: CIS in voided urine presents as flat sheets of five to 15 cells with features of high grade malignancy. Development of tumour during follow up was suggested by the appearance of large thick sheets and clusters of 30 or more malignant cells which were large and pleomorphic in high grade tumours and relatively small and closely cohesive in low grade tumours. Eleven of 13 patients with these clusters had bladder or ureteric tumours and two had malignant disease in the prostate. Negative cytological results in the presence of degenerative changes caused by chemotherapy was an unreliable indicator of response to chemotherapy, and there were five patients with false negative reports during treatment, of whom three had developed tumour. Persistence of malignant cells with features similar to those seen in the urine before treatment reliably predicted failure to respond to chemotherapy.\r"

Both early invasive and in situ adenocarcinoma stained equally intensely with both agents and both antibodies stained diffusely tubal metaplasia, endometrial lined glands, and even occasional areas of normal endocervical mucosa. It is concluded that these agents are unlikely to be of use in the routine histological differentiation of glandular and squamous cervical dysplasia or neoplasia, but immunostaining with anti-EMA may help differentiate between reactive and metaplastic changes in endocervical glands and adenocarcinoma in situ.\r"

The method is based on the principle of affinity chromatography and adapted to a batch separation technique. A specific ligand staphylococcal protein A was coupled to Sepharose to form a convenient solid phase matrix. The intrinsic factor binding antibody in patients with pernicious anaemia was used to form an immune complex with Cbl-IF. This complex was adsorbed on to staphylococcal protein A. Gastric juice from control subjects and patients with pernicious anaemia was assayed for intrinsic factor activity and the results correlated very closely with two other established methods. Sera from 30 control subjects were assayed for binding intrinsic factor antibody and all were found to be negative; of 15 patients with pernicious anaemia, six were positive. These patients were selected with blocking antibody. The method does not require technologically advanced protein separation techniques and could therefore be applied in any clinical laboratory using radioisotopes. It could also be adapted to assay cobalamin in body fluids or in food.\r"

The DNA distribution, the rate of aneuploid cells exceeding 5c (5cER), and the square deviation index of DNA values from the normal 2c-peak (2cDI) were recorded. Both variables were of diagnostic and prognostic importance for epithelial tumours, malignant lymphomas, and dysplastic lesions. A rate of 5cER greater than 0 was found in eight of 10 myelodysplastic, but in none of seven control cases. Hypodiploidy was equally pronounced in both groups of patients. The 5cE had the highest discriminative value of all variables calculated. The 2cDI was not significantly different in either group. In pernicious anaemia the 2cDI depended mainly on the percentage of S cells, reflecting the defect of DNA synthesis. In RA with megaloblastosis the 2cDI correlated with the percentage of G2 cells, reflecting G2 arrest. In the myelodysplastic group the 2cDI correlated positively with the length of time until ANL developed, indicating the prognostic relevance of 2cDI. Our findings show that in megaloblastic anaemia DNA image cytometry can distinguish myelodysplasia from pernicious anaemia and that it also provides prognostic information.\r"

Initial coagulation studies showed a prolonged thrombin time and increased concentrations of serum fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products and plasma D-dimer. Further studies on purified fibrinogen showed evidence of degradation of the C-terminal ends of the A-alpha chains, which, it is suggested, resulted from the action of circulating pancreatic proteases. Fibrin polymerisation was thus shown to be impaired, which explains the prolongation of the thrombin time. There was a temporal relation between increased amylase activities and the prolonged thrombin time, both of which returned to normal three weeks after admission. Acquired dysfibrinogenaemia may be an underrecognized phenomenon in acute pancreatitis and may lead to misinterpretation of coagulation test abnormalities.\r"

Parallel sections were used for routine histological tissue verification and for direct comparison with immunohistochemistry for oestrogen receptor. Specific immunoperoxidase staining with a rat monoclonal antibody was scored by semiquantitative evaluation of the staining intensity of cancer cell nuclei. Oestrogen receptor scoring was highly reproducible when performed by the same observer. The semiquantitative immunohistochemical oestrogen receptor score correlated significantly better with the radiochemical assay on sections than with cytosol assay. Oestrogen receptor in breast cancer can be reliably assayed by semiquantitative evaluation of cryostat sections immunostained for oestrogen receptor, but only if the procedure is adequately standardised. The results underline the importance of cellular heterogeneity as a cause of variation in oestrogen receptor assay evaluation in breast cancer.\r"

Colonic and ovarian adenocarcinomas were immunostained with a panel of antibodies which have a limited specificity for colon (parlam-4, 19.9, anti-secretory component) and ovary (OV-TL3 and OC125) and the most discriminatory antibodies were selected by stepwise linear discriminant analysis. For frozen material OV-TL3 and OC125 were the best classifying antibodies. Although OC125 had better discriminative power, for paraffin wax embedded material parlam-4 was selected as the best classifying antibody. OC125 had no additional effect on the classification of a tumour. These antibodies were subsequently tested on an independent test set of primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas of colonic and ovarian origin. When ovarian posterior probabilities of less than 0.1 and greater than 0.9 were selected as cut off points for a positive identification of colonic or ovarian origin (jackknifed classification method), no adenocarcinoma was incorrectly identified as ovarian carcinoma in frozen material. The same trend was noticed for paraffin wax embedded material. Statistical analysis of antigen profiles can be helpful in defining the colonic or ovarian origin of an adenocarcinoma when routine microscopy does not yield a definitive result.\r"

The results of the IgG immunoblot test showed excellent correlation with the detection of C pylori by culture and also with histopathological examination of the antrum, as well as with peptic ulcer disease. An IgA response also occurred and gave results comparable with those of the IgG immunoblot test, although on a quantitatively lower scale. The IgM immunoblots were of no help in the serodiagnosis of C pylori infection. The protein bands that seemed to be the most specific for C pylori and which were consistently observed in patients positive for C pylori were a 110 kilodalton and a 63 kilodalton band on the IgG immunoblot and an 89 kilodalton band on the IgA immunoblot. A 94 kilodalton and a 28 kilodalton band were also included in the evaluation. While immunoblot analysis may be used effectively for the serodiagnosis of C pylori infection and can distinguish between patients with normal antrum mucosa and those with gastritis, the test does not help to distinguish between those patients with antrum gastritis who subsequently develop peptic ulcers and those who do not.\r"

The Isolator system, a lysis centrifugation method, facilitated the most rapid isolation of MAI (p = 0.001). The Bactec Middlebrook medium gave the most rapid detection rate (p = 0.001) as acid fast bacilli could be stained by the Ziehl-Neelson method before colonies were isolated in the Isolator system. The growth index readings did not reliably predict mycobacterial growth in the two radiometric media tested.

  ".W": "The use of a faecal preservative and several staining methods, together with formalin ether concentration, were evaluated for the improved diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis and giardiasis in 1285 patients with diarrhoea or dysentery and from asymptomatic controls. All samples were screened by three wet mount techniques. Thirty eight specimens of diarrhoeal or dysenteric stool were preserved in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and stained by trichrome and Spencer and Monroe short iron haematoxylin stain. Thirty nine preserved faecal samples submitted for routine screening were subjected to formalin ether concentration, wet mount examination, and permanent staining. Saline and buffered methylene blue (BMB) mounts were equally good for detection of trophozoite Entamoebae while Giardia trophozoites were detected only by the saline mount. The iodine mount was superior to the other mounts for protozoan cyst detection. The concentration procedure enhanced cyst recovery. Faecal preservation and subsequent staining was superior to wet mount examination for detection of the trophozoite stage and avoided the need for fresh specimens. Both the trichrome and the iron haematoxylin stains were comparable for the detection of cysts and trophozoites of the Entomoebae. Giardia lamblia trophozoites stained better with iron haematoxylin than with the trichrome. Preservation and permanent staining is recommended as the most productive means for the accurate identification of the various protozoan parasites.\r"

The highest irradiance was always at the umbilicus and the lowest was on the face. We evaluated compliance with accepted safety principles and federal guidelines and regulations; too often we found no eye protection and sometimes we found inadequate limits of exposure time. Persons with skin types I and II were sometimes promised a safe, effective UVA tan that would protect against sunburn. From our experience we concluded that if the industry is to continue, there is need for closer supervision and regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of venous ulcers is unclear. It is difficult to be clinically certain of the presence of infection. Routine bacteriology is often unhelpful, and any simple investigation that improves diagnosis in this situation would be of value. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are useful in detecting infection in other situations, and they may be of value in this context as well. C-reactive protein levels were measured in 50 patients with venous leg ulcers and in 20 patients with active venous eczema. There was no elevation of CRP levels in patients with eczema alone, nor in the majority of patients with ulcers. Sixteen patients had raised CRP levels: 7 had clinically obvious infection, and 9 had erythematous skin of uncertain cause surrounding their ulcers. All had positive bacterial cultures from the ulcer base, with beta-hemolytic streptococci the main contaminant. Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic reduced CRP levels to normal, cleared the bacteria from the ulcers, and was associated with resolution of erythema. CRP levels appear to distinguish between infectious and inflammatory causes of erythema in patients with gravitational disease.\r"

  ".W": "Successful results have been reported for bath-psoralens plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment of psoriasis with the use of either a low-sensitizing psoralen (methoxsalen) or a high-sensitizing psoralen (trioxsalen), but no evidence has been presented that phototoxicity would be a prerequisite for antipsoriatic activity of these treatments. To study therapeutic-to-phototoxic ratios, bath-PUVA was applied to psoriasis patients with the use of either a 0.2 mg/L solution of trioxsalen or a 0.4 mg/L solution of methoxsalen. The average minimal phototoxic ultraviolet A (UVA) dose (MPD) obtained after 15 minutes' bathing was 0.86 joule/cm2 for trioxsalen and 9.76 joules/cm2 for methoxsalen. In the first part of the study phototoxically equipotent treatment schedules were used, compensating the much lower phototoxic potential of methoxsalen by using about 10 times larger UVA doses compared to the doses used with trioxsalen. A healing rate of 71% +/- 25% was recorded for trioxsalen and 63% +/- 34% for methoxsalen treatment (mean +/- SD). Both PUVA treatments decreased epidermal Langerhans cell counts to 10% to 20% of the control value. In the second part of the study, the much lower phototoxic potential of methoxsalen was not compensated for. Instead, methoxsalen bath-PUVA was carried out with the use of UVA doses physically similar to those used in the trioxsalen therapy series. Surprisingly enough, even this very suberythemal methoxsalen therapy caused a significant healing effect (51% +/- 10%). Langerhans cell depletion in methoxsalen-bathed areas (reduction to 53% of the control value) was much less than that caused in trioxsalen-bathed areas (reduction to 11% of the control value).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Alopecia areata is unexpectedly common and apparently associated with stress. Pruritus, which is common, is related to both environment and stress. Dermatologic diseases seen commonly in blacks are more prevalent because of the population demographics, yet pseudofolliculitis barbae is unusual as a complaint.

Patients with aquagenic pruritus were helped by adding sodium bicarbonate to the bath water while patients with aquagenic pruritus of the elderly responded to emollients. It is suggested that aquagenic pruritus and aquagenic pruritus of the elderly are two similar but distinct entities. Separating these two entities provides the key to successful treatment, because each of them responds to a different treatment without crossover. This report is only the second report indicating the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate baths in patients with aquagenic pruritus.

Significant healing of the skin was noted within 1 month. There was an associated remission of the patient's cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The dosage of cyclosporine was progressively tapered and then discontinued after 7 months, when healing was complete. No relapse occurred in the subsequent 14 months, and there was an associated remission of the patient's cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Another 7.4% experienced cure in the region treated, but subsequent recurrence in another region. Cure does not seem to be associated with the localization of the disease or preoperative duration, but the group of patients who were cured were significantly older at the onset of the disease (p less than 0.001) than the group with recurrent disease. Patient satisfaction with excisional surgery was high, with 68% reporting surgery to be superior to other types of treatment experienced and only 6% considering it worse. It is hypothesized that the rapid relief, even if offered temporarily, in an otherwise chronic disease is the cause of this high patient satisfaction.\r"

DERM/INFONET consists of a number of data bases providing information and educational programs for the dermatologist. Currently the components are: DERM/MLS (Medical Literature Search), DERM/RX (dermatologic therapy), DERM/USP (United States Pharmacopeia data base), DERM/ALLERGENS (Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency Listings of allergens); Melanoma Prognosis Model; Electronic Mail; Bulletin Board; Meetings Calendar; ICD/CPT (International Classification of Diseases/Current Procedural Terminology) codes; AAD Membership/Committee Directories; and Dermatology Quiz. Additional data bases are planned. As audiovisual and alphanumeric communication systems evolve, newer opportunities for enhancing the DERM/INFONET Biomedical Communication Network will undoubtedly provide even greater opportunities for aiding the dermatologist in delivering state-of-the art management for their patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recently we reported that a kind of serine protease, SH protease, and collagenase might be involved in blister formation and, furthermore, that the cooperative action of these three proteases was essential for blister formation in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In this study we examined the inhibitory effect of clinically usable serine protease inhibitors for blister formation in organ culture and in clinical trials of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patients. Camostat mesylate, a synthetic serine protease inhibitor that is available for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis, demonstrated a striking effect of inhibiting blistering in organ culture of normal human skin with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa blister fluids. Subsequently we administered camostat mesylate by topical application to four patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa to assess its ability to reduce blistering. Therapeutic response was favorable; a significant effect in decreasing the number of blisters was observed in three of four patients. These findings actually supported the hypothesis that a kind of serine protease had a close relationship with blistering in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and that therapy with a clinically usable protease inhibitor was useful for the treatment of this disease.\r"

Of four corticosteroid-resistant pemphigus vulgaris patients, all improved after cyclosporine addition to corticosteroids. The last patient treated from the beginning with a combined treatment (cyclosporine-corticosteroids) did not respond. The main advantage of using cyclosporine is to allow a decrease in corticosteroid dosages and to permit treating corticosteroid-resistant pemphigus vulgaris patients. No detectable irreversible side effects were noted. The treatment was discontinued in two patients because of reversible side effects. Cyclosporine alone does not seem to be an adequate treatment of the acute phase of pemphigus vulgaris but could be used in addition to corticosteroids. The most important drawback of cyclosporine treatment is the occurrence of clinically silent renal dysfunction (tubular involvement and interstitial fibrosis), which may occur during long-term treatments. More studies need to be carried out to determine the effects of low doses of cyclosporine on renal function in patients who have normal renal functions.\r"

With the help of colposcopy, both microscopic and flat warts that cannot be visualized with traditional, noncolposcopic methods can be seen and, hence, treated. Recently, studies reported in the gynecologic and urologic literature have evaluated the usefulness of colposcopy in male patients. We present a patient whose genital warts were recalcitrant to treatment. When examined with colposcopy he was noted to have multiple additional areas of involvement. In view of the neoplastic potential of the human papillomavirus, the ease with which it is transmitted sexually, and the difficulty in discerning certain kinds of warts without colposcopy, we believe colposcopic examination should be routine in all men with genital warts and in those whose sexual partners have tested positive for human papillomavirus.\r"

Sixty-seven patients had been treated with PUVA, 43 with Goeckerman regimen, and 41 with both therapies. One patient alone (62-year-old man) developed squamous cell carcinoma on the leg with cumulative ultraviolet A (UVA) dose of only 51 joules/cm2, he had a history of treatment with superficial x-ray therapy to this area 30 years prior to PUVA. The cancer was detected after 1.4 years of PUVA treatment. However, other patients at follow-up, even those who had received a cumulative dose of UVA of more than 1000 joules/cm2, had no skin cancer after more than 2 years. This report in Japanese patients confirms that only previous exposure to other risk factors such as ionizing radiation appears to be a most important factor for skin cancer formation in PUVA-treated Japanese patients.\r"

On light microscopy his disorder resembled generalized eruptive histiocytoma or the indeterminate cell disorder. Special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy were noncontributory. Indirect immunofluorescence studies with monoclonal antibodies to cell surface markers demonstrated infiltrating cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage (OKM1, MAC-1, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ positive) rather than Langerhans or indeterminate cell lineage (OKT6 negative). This case may overlap two or more of the previously reported non-X histiocytic syndromes, suggesting that perhaps these syndromes should be viewed as a spectrum of disease rather than as discrete entities. We recommend performing cell phenotyping on all new cases of non-X histiocytosis because clinical, microscopic, and ultramicroscopic findings often prove inadequate for classification.\r"

The mean age at onset of the disease was 33 years (range, 5 to 63 years) and the mean duration of disease was 9 years (range, 1 to 40 years). After pressure stimulus, the mean onset of whealing occurred in 3 1/2 hours, the mean peak swelling occurred after 10 hours, and the mean lesion duration was 36 hours. Two thirds of patients had generalized flulike symptoms. Sixty percent had disabling nonremitting delayed pressure urticaria. Sixty-two percent had coexistent chronic idiopathic urticaria, and 27% had angioedema. Delayed pressure urticaria was confirmed by pressure tests with either a calibrated dermographometer or suspended weights. More than 50% of patients tested also had delayed dermographism. A double-blind, controlled, crossover trial of indomethacin therapy in 14 patients revealed no significant subjective improvement or reduction in area of induced wheals. We conclude: (1) The diagnosis of delayed pressure urticaria can be easily made by dermographometer testing. (2) Delayed dermographism may be the same entity as delayed pressure urticaria induced by a different method of pressure application. (3) Systemic corticosteroids remain the only known effective treatment for disabling delayed pressure urticaria.\r"

Bone marrow investigation results were normal in 48%, or showed eosinophilia (32%) or hyperplasia (20%). Initial skin biopsies showed nonspecific histology in most patients, but later biopsies revealed pleomorphic infiltration. During the observation period four patients progressed to mycosis fungoides and another nine patients were suspected of having mycosis. None developed Sezary's syndrome. Only one third of the patients went into complete remission; half of them died during the observation period. Patients with erythroderma of unknown etiology are predominantly men and seem to belong to a certain subgroup--herein called the red man syndrome.\r"

Difficulty in distinguishing the erythematous lesions appropriate for biopsy and treatment can be partially overcome with the use of a supravital stain well known to oral surgeons. This paper recommends the addition of this test to the dermatologist's armamentarium. Five patients with mucosal in situ squamous cell carcinoma were treated. Three had squamous cell carcinoma of the glans penis, one of the vulva, and one of the oral mucosa. In all patients the toluidine blue test was helpful in the diagnosis of subclinical malignant epithelium, in the delineation of the lesion borders as a guide for surgery, and, postoperatively, in the detection of early disease recurrence. The toluidine blue test, which is a simple procedure accessible to all dermatologists, can help achieve early diagnosis and effective treatment of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

Serum and erythrocyte folate levels in maternal and cord blood were correlated with dietary folacin intakes in subsamples of the group. Women who received their folate from diet alone showed marginal or deficient maternal serum folate levels. Of the group of women whose folacin intake was equal to or greater than the RDA for pregnant women, some had intakes as high as eight times the RDA from supplements.

The high serum and erythrocyte folate levels resulting from self-medication with folate supplements are of concern because of possible deleterious interaction with other nutrients.\r"

  ".W": "Feeding patterns of 116 urban black infants were studied from 3 weeks to 6 months of age. Dietary data were collected using a diet history and a food frequency checklist completed by trained interviewers at each well child clinic visit at 3 weeks and at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. At 3 weeks, 20% of the infants were solely breast fed, 58% were formula fed, and 22% were partially breast fed. Twenty percent of 3-week-old infants were receiving baby foods. This increased to 48% at 2 months, and to 72% at 4 months. By 6 months of age, 98% of infants received baby foods. Nursing mothers tended to introduce baby foods later than formula-feeding mothers. This is consistent with other studies. Commercially prepared baby foods were used much more commonly than were foods prepared at home. Infant cereal was most often introduced first, followed by strained juices, strained fruits, strained vegetables, combination dinners, desserts, and plain meats, in that order. Table foods contributed very little to caloric intakes of infants less than 4 months of age. Liberal amounts of water and sugar water were given to infants in this cultural group.\r"

A fourfold increase in sodium intake occurred from 6 months to 4 years, and potassium intake doubled. Sodium increased from 0.88 gm at 6 months to 3.21 gm at 4 years and 3.67 gm by 17 years; a slight increase for potassium was noted from 4 to 17 years for boys. Calcium intake was relatively constant from 6 months to 17 years. Boys had higher intakes of sodium and sodium per kilogram body weight than did girls. Black children at 2, 3, and 4 years had significantly higher sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium expressed as total intake and per kilogram body weight than white children did. At 6 months, 66% of the infants exceeded the National Research Council's recommended range for sodium. At 1 to 10 years, 90% to 100% and at 13 to 17 years, 60% to 65% exceeded the recommended range. In contrast, 58% to 77% of preschool children and only 5% to 20% of school-age children surpassed the recommended potassium range. Fifty percent to 70% of children more than 10 years old achieved the recommended range for potassium. Approximately half of the children 6 months through 4 years of age met the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium. Sixty percent to 80% of adolescents ingested less than two-thirds the RDA. Girls had lower intakes than did boys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data from 10,515 persons examined in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) were used to compare mean dietary intakes of several nutrients and food groups, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin between regular supplement users and nonusers aged 16 to 74 years. Prevalences of impaired iron status also were compared between user groups. Users consumed more vitamin C and ate fruits and vegetables more frequently than did nonusers in all age/sex groups. No significant differences in mean iron status indicators were observed except in the 65 to 74 year age/sex groups: transferrin saturation among men and mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin among women. In each case, users had higher values than nonusers in this age group. Prevalences of impaired iron status did not differ between users and nonusers in any age/sex group. In general, iron status was not associated with supplement use.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effectiveness of two types of training on the ability to estimate food portion sizes. Training consisted of a 10-minute group session in which subjects practiced measuring various solid and liquid foods with household measures. A second group of subjects viewed food models of solids and liquids. Immediately following training, subjects individually quantified portion sizes of foods displayed as a breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A third group, whose members received no training, also estimated the same food portion sizes. Results indicated no statistically significant difference (p greater than .05) between the two types of training using both parametric and non-parametric tests. When the trained groups were combined and compared with the untrained group, MANOVA analysis indicated training made a significant difference (p less than .05) in improving estimation for some food items. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also supported the hypothesis that training improved estimation for some, but not all, food items. Although a significant difference was not found for all food items, the data lend some support to the practice of using food models or household measures to enhance the ability to estimate food portion sizes more accurately, even when training is undertaken in short group sessions.\r"

  ".W": "Preceded by 6 months of ethnographic research, a survey of 107 Navajo women, primarily food assistance participants, was conducted to describe and evaluate the contemporary Navajo diet. On the basis of results of 1-day dietary recalls, mean nutrient intakes were found to be below the RDA for calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin A, and energy. Sixty-three percent of the women in the sample were overweight or obese. The overall percentages of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein were closer to those recommended in the Dietary Goals than those in the current U.S. diet. The fat in the diet appeared to be primarily saturated, however, and fiber intake was lower than the U.S. average. Traditional foods were infrequently consumed. Women with higher incomes tended to have better diets. Commodity foods supplied by USDA's Food Distribution Program provided 43% of caloric intake and 37% to 57% of the intakes of all other nutrients except fat and vitamin C for the 72% of the sample participating in that program. It is concluded that the Food Distribution Program provides an important nutritional contribution to the contemporary Navajo diet.\r"

The formation of random and varied radiolytic products (RPs) in foods that have been irradiated is the focus of criticism of the process, because RPs may affect the sensory and nutritive quality of foods processed with ionizing radiation. The FDA has deemed the process safe, within specified doses, for use on spices, some meats, fruits, and vegetables. Dietitians should be prepared to answer consumer questions related to irradiation as the process becomes more widespread.\r"

Also, 12% agreed that the consumption of salt tablets during athletic events prevents muscle cramps. The results suggest nutrition education for HPE teachers is needed. Information provided to HPE teachers should address their three main nutrition concerns, which are a balanced diet for athletes, weight control, and fluid replacement.\r"

We examined the effect of an additional threefold dose of influenza B vaccine on the antibody response in elderly, ambulatory veterans. One hundred thirty-one male subjects aged 70 years and older were randomized to receive one of three influenza vaccine regimens: Group I received standard trivalent influenza vaccine containing 15 micrograms of B/USSR/100/83 in one arm and placebo in the other; Group II received standard trivalent vaccine in one arm and a supplemental dose of 45 micrograms of B/USSR in the other; Group III received the same dose as group II combined in one arm with a placebo in the other. Antibody levels were measured at baseline, 1 month, and 5 months. Nearly 80% of the participants achieved levels of antibody to B/USSR considered protective; seroconversion rates varied from 40% to 61%. No significant differences in antibody response to B/USSR occurred among the vaccine groups, and there were more side effects at higher doses. The higher dose groups did, however, achieve greater antibody levels to the drifted influenza B virus which circulated during the year of the study. Response to the influenza A components of the vaccine, however, may have been blunted in Group III which received a large dose of A and B antigens all at one site.\r"

  ".W": "A self-administered postal questionnaire was presented to all attending members (843) of local summer meetings of a national association for retired persons. A 71% response rate (599) revealed that 33% of the total sample population experienced some form of urinary incontinence. Twenty-three and seven-tenths percent (142) experienced occasional urine dribbling, 2.3% (14) were unable to prevent involuntary emptying of their bladder, and 7.3% (44) suffered both problems. Eighty-three percent of the respondents were between the ages of 65 and 85 years. Females accounted for 75% of all respondents. Respondents 75 years of age or older had a higher occurrence of all forms of urinary incontinence (P = 0.57), and a strong association existed with the same age-group and uncontrolled emptying of the bladder (P = .02). Thirty-seven percent of the females and 22% of the males reported having had an incontinent episode (P = .002). High parity (four or more births) was significantly associated with incontinence in females (P = .04). These survey findings provide prevalence estimates of urinary incontinence that are greater than those previously reported and show statistical differences by age and gender. The study population is not representative of all the noninstitutionalized elderly, but consists primarily of individuals who are active, ambulatory, generally healthy and may underestimate the magnitude of the problem. Urinary incontinence is substantiated as a major health problem in even the most functional community-residing elderly citizens.\r"

Eighty-eight percent of the cases had tibial/brachial arterial systolic pressure indices below 0.95, the lower limit traditionally considered normal. Yet, no more than 5% of the patients carried a previous diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease or had intermittent claudication, leg ulcers or gangrene. Approximately half of the patients had tibial/brachial pressure indices less than 0.7, and one year later in these cases, there was significantly greater morbidity and nearly twice the mortality of patients with less severe disease. We conclude that simple bedside diagnostic tests of arterial disease used in this study discloses a high prevalence of disease in institutionalized elderly patients and identifies a group at particular risk for morbid complications.\r"

We developed a system of weekly follow-up and home visits to record and confirm all falls. During the study, 179 participants suffered at least one fall that was confirmed by home visit. At the end of the study, all subjects were interviewed by telephone about whether they had suffered a fall during the preceding 3, 6, or 12 months. Depending on the time period of recall, 13% to 32% of those with confirmed falls did not recall falling during the specific period of time. Recall was better for the preceding 12 months than for 3 or 6 months. There were only weak correlations (r = 0.28 to 0.59) between the number of falls that were documented and the number that the subjects recalled during each of these periods. Those with lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination were more likely to forget falls. We conclude that elderly subjects often do not recall falls that occurred during specific periods of time over the preceding 3 to 12 months. Researchers and clinicians should consider using methods besides long-term recall for ascertaining and counting falls over specific periods of time.\r"

MK31, although longer lived than wild type, is equivocal, in some cases failing to complement age-1 but not in others. All three long-lived strains have reduced hermaphrodite self-fertility and also fail to complement for this presumed pleiotropic effect of the age-1 mutation. Each of these three strains also contains an independent mutation at unc-31 IV. Since the mutants were isolated in the same mutant hunt (Klass, 1983) using protocols that did not guarantee independence, the mutations cannot be assumed to be independently isolated.\r"

Nine subjects underwent two identical tests before training (learning effect) and a third after a 12-week training program. VO2 max increased 9.0% with training, but was unchanged before training. Maximal duration increased 6.7% before training and a further 6.3% after training. Submaximal heart rate (HR) decreased 3.8% before training and an additional 5.3% with training. We conclude that VO2 max is a reliable measure of change in physical training in older persons. Maximal duration and submaximal HR are subject to a learning effect and cannot be relied upon to document a training effect.\r"

Fifteen young (mean age 26 years) and 15 older (mean age 71 years) adult subjects were instructed to rapidly push or pull on a hand-held manipulandum. Postural muscle response onset latencies of the lower leg were significantly increased in the older adult group in three of the four conditions when compared to the young adult group. In addition, prime mover muscle response onset latencies of the upper arm showed a large, significant increase in older adults beyond that due to the slowing of the postural response. The results suggest two conclusions. The voluntary control system may be affected to a slightly greater degree with age resulting in slower voluntary movement in the elderly. Or, deterioration of the postural control system with age slows the speed of voluntary movement by delaying the onset of the voluntary muscle response.\r"

Within the limitations of the study (a volunteer sample and a simple questionnaire index of physical activity), the data show a decrease of activity in men, but not in women, from age 50 to the retirement years. The main factors influencing disability, and therefore health-care costs, were age (disability greater in older subjects) and sex (disability greater in women than in men). ANCOVA indicated that after allowing for these two variables, there was a possible small effect of physical activity at age 50 upon subsequent disability (p less than .094), together with a significant physical activity/sex interaction (p less than .030). However, a multivariate linear regression analysis of quality-adjusted health-care costs showed no significant effect of physical activity at age 50 upon subsequent disability. Nor did those surviving to the higher quintiles of the retirement years show a higher physical activity score at age 50 than those in the lower quintiles. While further research with more precise instruments remains desirable, the present results suggest that habitual physical activity at the age of 50 has only a weak association with lower levels of current physical disability and no relationship to resultant health-care costs during the years of retirement.\r"

Serum creatine kinase activity, flexed and relaxed elbow joint angles, and muscle pain were assessed prior to and for 5 days after each exercise session. The exercise resulted in similar changes in CK, muscle pain, and inability to fully flex the forearm for old and young subjects. The old group demonstrated greater muscle shortening (a decrease in the relaxed elbow joint angle). The old and young groups adapted to the first exercise such that changes in all criterion measures were reduced following the second exercise. For the physically active subjects in this study, the damage process (with the exception of muscle shortening) takes a similar course for old and young. The repair process is equally as effective in old and young, and older subjects show the same ability to adapt to the damage as young subjects.\r"

Twenty-four of 262 (9.2%) nonreactors converted to tuberculin reactors 6 months after exposure. Six of the convertors were among the 21% of the residents who were originally considered anergic on the basis of negative Candida and Trichophyton skin tests. These results confirm the observation that aged nursing home residents have lower rates of tuberculin reactivity than earlier in their lives, and that tuberculosis is a nosocomial infection in nursing homes. However, generalized immune senescence cannot be invoked as a reason for apparent susceptibility because the very marker of infection--the development of tuberculin reaction--is evidence of some degree of immune competence. Furthermore, the presence of cutaneous anergy as clinically determined does not predict inability to develop an immune response to the tubercle bacillus.\r"

In addition, earlier findings that the elderly improved more than younger adults were replicated. Multivariate analysis found age and number of sessions in therapy predict change scores, with diagnosis alone being a good predictor of outcome with initial rating held constant. It is suggested that chronological age is neither the only nor the most important determinant of outcome in mental health treatment.\r"

Older adults were generally slower to identify targets, particularly in multi-element arrays. Age differences favoring the elderly were found in target-similar identification accuracy, but the young identified targets more accurately in alternate-similar noise. Localization errors were greater among the elderly, who exhibited a bias to localize targets to central array positions. Age differences in noise effects are explained as resulting from ontogenic change in the duration of temporal integration required to encode arrays to the level of a primary detection response (Estes, 1982). The model's predictions were given small-scale validation when visibility was decreased in young adults who then produced performance profiles similar to the elderly.\r"

Self-rating of health was an independent predictor of survival after controlling for age, sex, continent of origin, number of conditions and medications reported, heart disease and activities of daily living (ADL).

Bowery men scored worse than an aged-matched sample of community men on all physical health scales, with the greatest differences occurring in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, edema, hearing, hypertension, and ambulatory scales. Frequency of visits to doctors by the Bowery men was comparable to that of the community men, and the Bowery men rated their health substantially better than did their counterparts of two decades ago. Poor physical health often appeared to antedate arrival on the Bowery. However, a hierarchical regression analysis identified several variables--stress, unfulfilled needs, being relatively young, institutional/agency contacts--that were associated with current levels of poor health. Identification of these variables pointed to areas that warrant closer attention by clinicians and service providers.\r"

In the toxic phase during which the patient shows clinical or laboratory evidence of toxicity, the history, clinical status (signs, symptoms, drug levels, laboratory parameters), and toxicodynamics should guide the therapy. In the resolution phase, when the patient shows clinical improvement and declining drug levels, treatment should be based on clinical status. Gastrointestinal decontamination is critical in the first two phases and may be of value during the resolution phase until the body drug burden declines to safe levels. We recommend an aggressive approach to gastrointestinal decontamination, especially in the preclinical phase. With a history of a potentially toxic ingestion of an absorbable drug, an observation period until passage of a charcoal-laden stool should be achieved before discharge of the patient.\r"

This algorithm correctly predicted which patients required admission, whether due to present or impending complications, and which patients could have been discharged without morbidity or mortality.

Although its function is unknown, the CD14 gene maps to a region encoding several myeloid growth factors and receptors. Analysis of the CD14 protein sequence deduced from the cDNA shows that although the CD14 protein contains a characteristic leader peptide, it lacks a characteristic transmembrane region, suggesting that CD14 may be anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (PI). Treatment of monocytes as well as a CD14-expressing neuroglioma cell line with PI-phospholipase C removed CD14 from the cell surface. Furthermore, monocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a disease characterized by lack of expression of other PI-linked proteins, failed to express CD14. Interestingly, the CD14-expressing neuroglioma cell line, which had been transfected with a single CD14 cDNA, released a soluble form of CD14 into the supernatant. Soluble forms of CD14 have previously been observed in serum of normal individuals and in culture supernatants of CD14+ cells. Biosynthetic experiments reveal that this soluble form of CD14 (48 kDa), which is smaller than the form released from the membrane by PI-phospholipase C (53 kDa), does not contain ethanolamine, the first constitutent of the PI-anchoring system. These studies demonstrate that CD14 is a member of the family of PI-anchored proteins and suggest that soluble forms of CD14 represent molecules that completely lack the PI-anchoring system.\r"

We report here that human CRP acquired the ability to augment platelet reactivity when treated with an Fe2+ (Cu2+)-ascorbate system. CRP modified by such treatment showed no appreciable activation of platelets in the absence of platelet activators such as platelet-activating factor, thrombin, or ADP. However, in the presence of the modified-CRP, irreversible activation of platelets occurred with sub-optimal doses of platelet-activating factor and other stimulatory agents for platelets. CRP without any treatment did not show any modulating activity. Each component of the Fe2+-ascorbate system was required for modification of CRP, suggesting that CRP was modified through an oxidative process. The modification of the CRP structure was confirmed by the change in the fluorescence spectrum of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate complexed with CRP, the increased susceptibility of CRP to proteolytic enzymes and the altered reactivity to anti-CRP mAb. We also found an inactivating system for the modified CRP in plasma. The modified human CRP did not show any modulating activity toward rabbit platelets, suggesting that the activity is species specific.\r"

Exposure of isolated human PMN to ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) did indeed stimulate an increase in cellular adhesive function as assessed by an increase in the surface expression of the leukocyte adhesion-promoting glycoprotein, Mo1 (CD11b/CD18), the initiation of PMN aggregation, and (in the case of ATP) the attachment of increased numbers of albumin-coated polystyrene latex beads. However, this increase in PMN adhesive function was not accompanied by the generation of products of the respiratory burst. These in vitro data suggest the possible influence of secreted adenine nucleotides in promoting neutrophil adhesion-dependent interactions at inflammatory sites in vivo.\r"

Analysis of progeny and clones of these progeny by surface radiolabeling, surface immunofluorescence, and Western blotting failed to detect the 170-kDa Ag. Loss of this Ag was associated with the appearance of a series of new surface Ag. A cytotoxic mAb (5C1) was produced to one of the newly appearing antigens (approximately equal to 64 kDa) and Giardia resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 5C1 isolated. Neither the approximately equal to 64 kDa nor the 170 kDa Ag were present and were replaced by a second series of new Ag. These studies clearly establish the loss and subsequent replacement of two antigenically distinct epitopes on Giardia derived from a single organism.\r"

Herein biochemical and structural analyses of the HeFi-1 reactive membrane protein (HRMP) were done to identify its potential importance in cellular transformation in the Hodgkin's disease cell line L428, in the T cell lymphoma line HuT 78, and in several EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the mature form of the HRMP had an apparent Mr of 120 kDa in tumor cells and 116 kDa in the EBV-transformed cell lines and that it was phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine residues in all cell lines tested. The precursor to the HRMP is an 86-kDa core protein that, after processing by high mannose N-linked glycosylation, migrates with an apparent Mr of 90 kDa. This protein is then further processed to the mature 120-kDa HRMP in part by O-linked glycosylation, the addition of sialic acid residues, and by the conversion of N-linked oligosaccharides from the high mannose to the complex type. Detectable amounts of the 90-kDa molecule can be found in the membrane and, although this protein can be phosphorylated in vitro, it is not phosphorylated in intact cells. The combined results of this study suggest that the HRMP is involved in cellular metabolism and show that an unusual amount of post-translational processing of the 90-kDa precursor results in the formation, and perhaps phosphorylation, of the mature 120-kDa HRMP.\r"

Nomarski contrast microscopy of the envelopes purified from different sources reveals the existence of two major, but morphologically distinct classes: the very irregularily shaped fragile type CEf, and the polygonal rigid type CEr. Human keratinocytes in submerged culture are only able to produce type CEf. Specimens from healthy human epidermis contain largely type CEr. Psoriatic scales from different patients show both types in varying proportions. Tape stripping of normal epidermis reveals that type CEf is present in the lowermost layers of the stratum corneum and type CEr is present in the upper layers, indicating that the two types represent a different stage of maturation. Cyanogen bromide peptide mapping of electrophoretically purified envelopes reveals striking differences between cultured keratinocytes, normal epidermis, and psoriatic scales but also slight interindividual variations. This variability supports the view that the molecular CE composition is not strictly determined. On the other hand, no difference could be detected in the peptide maps of CEf and CEr obtained after tape stripping from the same healthy volunteer indicating that CE maturation within the stratum corneum does not involve the provision of qualitatively new proteins.\r"

It has therefore been suggested that vitamin D3 or its active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 may be the mediator of UV-induced melanogenesis. To test this hypothesis, newborn foreskin-derived melanocytes were cultured in paired dishes in hormone-supplemented medium with 2% serum containing no detectable vitamin D3 or in the same medium containing 10(-8) or 10(-10) M of either provitamin D3, lumisterol, previtamin D3, vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. After 10 days, cell number in cultures containing vitamin D compounds was 93%-140% of unsupplemented controls and melanin content was 60%-120% of control, with no significant difference in either parameter for any compound tested. In separate experiments, human melanocytes and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells were repeatedly irradiated with physiologic doses of simulated sunlight and incubated between irradiations with provitamin D3, previtamin D3, vitamin D3, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Irradiated cultures had a 90%-95% inhibition of cell growth associated with a 200%-800% increase in melanin content per cell relative to controls, but there was no effect of any vitamin D compound on either cell type. Neither cultured human melanocytes nor S91 cells showed evidence of the cytosolic 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 receptor binding by sucrose density gradient analysis using radiolabeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The combined data strongly suggest that neither vitamin D3 nor its precursors or metabolites directly mediate melanogenesis in these cells.\r"

Keratin bodies are normally rapidly removed, but in primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) they are converted by an unknown mechanism to amyloid. Amyloid P component (AP), a glycoprotein identical to, and derived from, the normal plasma protein serum amyloid P component (SAP), is present in all forms of amyloid including PLCA. We investigated the interaction between SAP, keratin bodies, and KIFA. Immunofluorescence staining of normal skin using fluoresceinated anti-SAP and rhodamine-conjugated anti-IgM, or AE-1/AE-3 anti-keratin antibodies followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin, showed that 52% +/- 4 (mean +/- sem, n = 6) of keratin bodies bound anti-SAP. Similar findings were present in a biopsy from a patient with lichen planus. Isolated KIFA, prepared by 8M urea extraction of normal human epidermis or cultured keratinocytes, were preincubated with normal human serum as a source of SAP and then stained with fluoresceinated anti-SAP. Bright fluorescence seen when the incubation medium contained Ca++ was absent in the presence of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. Specific Ca++-dependent binding of SAP to KIFA was confirmed using immunoblotting. Binding of SAP to KIFA did not prevent their degradation following exposure to trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin. Similarly, partial enzymatic digestion of KIFA did not abrogate their ability to bind SAP. Our findings, that SAP is associated with keratin bodies in skin and exhibits Ca++-dependent binding to KIFA in vitro, identify keratin filaments as a newly recognized ligand for SAP.\r"

  ".W": "The percutaneous absorption of four steroids (hydrocortisone, estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone) has been measured in vivo in man under occluded and \"protected\" (i.e., covered, but non-occlusive) conditions. The experimental approach, involving simple modifications of standard radiochemical methodology, has enabled excellent \"mass balance\" and dose accountability to be achieved. Consequently, the utility of the procedure for the measurement of in vivo topical bioavailability can be inferred. In addition, because of the precision and accountability of the results, the technique offers a potential means to establish quantitative structure-penetration relationships for skin absorption in man. It was found that steroid absorption increased with increasing lipophilicity up to a point, but that penetration of progesterone (the most hydophobic analog studied) did not continue the trend and was at least partly rate-limited by slow interfacial transport at the stratum corneum-viable epidermis boundary. Comparison of data obtained from the occluded and \"protected\" experiments permitted the effect of occlusion (defined as the complete impairment of passive transepidermal water loss at the application site) to be assessed. Occlusion significantly increased percutaneous absorption of estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone but did not effect the penetration of hydrocortisone. A mechanism is proposed to explain why the absorption of the more lipophilic steroids is enhanced by occlusion but that of the most water-soluble (i.e., hydrocortisone) is not. It is suggested that the rate-determining role of the sequential steps involved in percutaneous absorption can be revealed by experiments of the type described using related series of homologous or analogous chemicals.\r"

  ".U": "88258087\r", 
  ".W": "During the formation of the mammalian epidermal permeability barrier, lipids are sequestered in the stratum corneum intercellular spaces, transforming from a relatively polar lipid mixture to predominantly nonpolar species. Certain lipid catabolic enzymes, which co-localize with these lipids, may regulate this process. In order to localize the sites within the outer epidermis where polar lipids are catabolized, and their relationship to the alterations in membrane structure that occur in these layers, we compared the biochemical localization of polar lipids, the ultrastructure, and freeze-fracture morphology, as well as the localization of phospholipases within the outer epidermis. Both histochemical staining of frozen sections and biochemical studies of protease- and tape-stripped whole stratum corneum demonstrated small amounts of polar lipids in the stratum compactum, while in contrast, the stratum disjunctum was devoid of both phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Phospholipase activity was present within lamellar bodies, among secreted lamellar body disks at the granular-cornified layer interface, and within the intercellular spaces of the stratum compactum. Both the depletion of polar lipids from the stratum compactum and deletion of these substances from the stratum disjunctum correlated with sequential changes in membrane structure observed by transmission electron microscopy and freeze-fracture. Thus, a phospholipase-mediated attack on phospholipids (with a parallel assault by other lipid catabolic enzymes on other polar species), may induce both the initial fusion and elongation of lamellar body disks and the subsequent formation of the hydrophobic membrane bilayers found in the mid-to-outer stratum corneum. These studies also may require modification of traditional views of the stratum corneum as a metabolically inert tissue, revealing its intercellular lipid domains to be partially in an active state of flux.\r"

Papillomavirus capsid antigen was demonstrated with the genus-specific antiserum and the patient's serum, which had IgM and IgG antibody titers. HPV DNA was isolated from biopsies and cloned into the vector pIC20H. It proved to be related to ev-associated viruses, showing 23% cross-hybridization with DNA of the closest relative HPV14. The new HPV type was named HPV46. The genome was physically mapped and colinearly aligned with HPV8 DNA to establish its gene organization. Interferon treatment of the patient did not significantly change the clinical picture nor was the concentration of viral DNA per lesion affected. However, no virus capsid antigen was detectable after starting treatment.\r"

The influence of vehicle, photodegradation, and dose was examined. Retinoid absorption through monkey skin was highly vehicle dependent and followed the order: propylene glycol = isopropyl alcohol greater than mineral oil greater than diisopropyl adipate greater than polyethylene glycol 400. Peak flux of etretinate (an ester) was less than 50% that of the acid retinoids in both human and monkey skin. Exposure to light caused a 60% degradation of isotretinoin on the surface of the skin, but did not change the amount of drug which penetrated the epidermis. In accord with this result, the amount of isotretinoin and acitretin which penetrated epidermis did not increase in proportion to dose over a 25-fold range of dose in human skin. Dermal concentration at doses of 10 micrograms/cm2 of isotretinoin and acitretin were greater than that reported for shave biopsies of human skin following treatment for several months with clinically effective doses of isotretinoin and etretinate (the parent ester of the acid acitretin).\r"

  ".W": "The inflammatory actions of synthetic C16:0 and C18:0 platelet activating factor (PAF) homologues, both alone and in combination, have been compared in an in vitro human neutrophil chemokinesis assay and by intradermal injection in human skin. In the chemokinesis assay, the maximum distance moved by neutrophils in the presence of C18:0 PAF was significantly greater than that seen with the C16:0 compound. A mixture of C16:0 and C18:0 PAFs in a ratio of 1:9 appeared to be more active than in a ratio of 3:1. Intradermal injection of the C16:0 and C18:0 PAF homologues induced dose-dependent increases in weal volume and flare area responses which were not significantly different. Combination of these phospholipids in a ratio of 3:1 or 1:9 of C16:0:C18:0 did not significantly alter the dose response curves. Thus, changes in the chain length of the alkyl substituent of synthetic PAF homologues and combination of these homologues, in ratios found in vivo or formed by leukocytes in vitro, did not alter the cutaneous inflammatory responses to PAF in man. The C18:0 homologue was, however, more active as a human neutrophil chemoattractant in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human foreskin keratinocytes have been utilized extensively to study modulations in protein content during epidermal differentiation. In this study we examined their usefulness as a model system for differentiation-linked changes in lipid content and metabolism. First-to-third passage keratinocytes were grown in 10% fetal calf serum on a mitomycin-treated 3T3 feeder layer and harvested at intervals before, during, and after reaching confluence for determination of lipid, protein, and DNA content. Lipid synthesis, determined as acetate incorporation into lipid, was most active in pre-confluent cultures and at all times closely paralleled the growth activity of the cultures. Post-confluent cultures were characterized by an increase in total lipid content and by increased triglyceride content and synthesis. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that labeling of the triglyceride pool was labile and suggested that even in post-confluent cultures, triglycerides provide a fatty acid reservoir for phospholipid biosynthesis. A novel band, which co-migrated with monoalkyldiacylglycerol in two solvents systems was present in confluent and post-confluent cultures, but absent in pre-confluent cultures. Sphingolipids constituted less than 10% of total lipid at all stages of growth, and cholesterol sulfate was present only in small quantities. These studies illustrate the relationship of lipid synthesis to growth and demonstrate that human foreskin keratinocytes, cultured under standard conditions, reproduce incompletely the lipid composition of epidermis in vivo.\r"
