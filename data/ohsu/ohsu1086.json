  ".W": "Trephination dates from prehistoric neolithic times (10,000-7000 B.C.) and is the oldest operation known. Cranioplasty with bone allografts dates from the Stone Age Celts. Through the millennia, generations of surgeons have tried bone autografts, allografts, and rarely xenografts for cranioplasty but abandoned these in favor of alloplastic metals and plastics, most recently methylmethacrylate. Disillusionment with bone cranioplasty has followed the recurrent experience that orthotopic transplantation of bone to skull is almost invariably accompanied by a striking propensity for resorption. Resorption coupled to new bone formation is the usual process of remodeling. A unique acellular nonosteoclastic resorption, antedating invasion of the graft by osteoprogenitor cells and unrelated to the remodeling, characterizes the initial response of bone placed in a skull bed. This previously undescribed resorption in the skull likely represents passive diffusion of mineral from an altered matrix (calciolysis) and varies directly with the degree the graft is denatured by processing. There is the least amount of resorption in the fresh autograft and the most in autoclaved or chemically treated frozen or freeze-dried grafts. Remodeling of this diminished template occurs centripetally from skull defect margins through osteoconductive mechanisms only. Marrow-poor skull with thin diploe provides few osteoprogenitor cells that slowly, incompletely remodel the reduced graft over years.\r"

The healing of the defects was assessed by gross examination, light microscopy, and immunologic analysis for 24 weeks. Immunologic assessment of cell-mediated immunity, cytotoxicity of a humoral antibody by a 51chromium release assay, and immunofluorescence studies were carried out. During the first two weeks following grafting, healing was excellent in 11 of the 17 defects. From three to 24 weeks, 11 of 42 defects examined had good results. Host lymphocytes had accumulated around the allograft at two to 12 weeks. Most of the implanted cartilage grown in vitro died and was replaced by fibrous tissue. The immunologic studies suggested that the implanted cartilage began to degenerate two to three weeks after implantation partially because of a humoral immune response but more importantly because of cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".U": "91284496\r", 
  ".W": "Pseudarthrosis after failed tibiotalar arthrodesis was successfully treated surgically in nine of 11 patients between 1980 and 1987. The indication for the initial attempted arthrodesis was traumatic arthrosis in seven patients, traumatic arthrosis with osteonecrosis of the talus in two patients, degenerative arthrosis in one patient with cavovarus foot (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), and myelodysplasia with progressive valgus deformity of the foot and ankle in one. The surgical technique planned for revision arthrodesis provided firm coaptation of tibia to talus with internal fixation that maintained the foot at right angles to the tibia with the forefoot in neutral position. Seven feet in 11 patients were treated using a transfibular approach that allowed excision of fibrous tissue and sclerotic bone, decortication of the media malleolus, fixation of the tibia to the talus with cancellous screws, and onlay/inlay fibular graft. Of the remaining four patients, one was treated with medial compression plate, a second was treated using an anteromedial cortical graft, a third was treated by a combination of sliding anteromedial corticocancellous graft and tibiotalar compression screw, and a fourth was treated with tibiotalar compression screw. Clinical and roentgenographic union occurred in nine of 11 patients. One patient developed a painless, fibrous union and one patient with persistent pseudarthrosis had myelodysplasia and severe valgus deformity and required amputation. Adequate exposure was possible through the transfibular approach to provide cancellous bone opposition, to excise the pseudarthrosis membrane and sclerotic bone, and to remove necrotic segments of the talus. In addition, supplemental bone graft, internal fixation, and postoperative cast immobilization were also helpful in obtaining union.\r"

  ".W": "Successful treatment of nonunited fractures remains a major clinical challenge. Because bone marrow and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) are capable of stimulating osteogenesis, experiments were designed to test the effectiveness of bone marrow or DBM or both when injected percutaneously into a canine nonunion model. Six-millimeter segmental defects were created in the midtibial diaphysis of 24 adult mongrel dogs and held distracted by external fixation. For comparative purposes, a 0.5-mm osteotomy was created in five dogs. Five weeks later, the 6-mm defects were injected with either saline, autogeneic marrow, DBM powder, a composite of bone marrow and DBM, or treated by open grafting techniques with autogenic cancellous bone. Healing of the defect was evaluated roentgenographically, biomechanically (three-point bending), histologically, and biochemically 13 weeks postsurgery. Marrow and DBM stimulated defect healing. However, the combination of bone marrow with DBM produced a synergistic response in the defect, which was greater than the sum of either marrow or DBM alone. Healing in the composite-grafted dogs was comparable to those treated by standard cancellous bone grafting. These data suggest that percutaneous injection of bone marrow and DBM may be a potential alternative that offers numerous advantages over standard open grafting techniques in the treatment of fractures with nonunited defects.\r"

The formation of cartilage and bone was observed seven days after the implantation of BMP-HAP, and the newly formed bone fused with the host calvaria after 28 days. In control rats, no bone formation was seen within 56 days after implantation. The BMP-HAP complex was more effective in induced periosteal bone formation than HAP only.\r"

Eleven patients (92%) achieved solid bony fusion. Two patients were deceased and one was lost to follow-up evaluation at the time of this study. These three patients were evaluated from clinical records and roentgenograms alone. Nine patients (mean age, 49 years), however, returned for evaluation by the authors (average postsurgery period, 1.7 years). A questionnaire, clinical exam, and a series of roentgenograms were obtained. An ankle rating scale was utilized and six patients were rated good or excellent. Two were rated poor and one was not rated because of underlying disease causing a weakened ambulatory status. Pain was the main determinant in placing a patient in the poor category. Both patients who rated poor had acceptable function. In this population, the hybrid combination of bimalleolar onlay grafting and triangular compression was found to be satisfactory in achieving a high degree of fusion and patient gratification.\r"

This permits excellent visualization of the ankle joint so that correction of the deformity can readily be achieved under direct visualization. Eighteen ankle fusions carried out through a transfibular approach were reviewed. The fusion site was stabilized with two or more 6.5-mm AO screws. No bone graft was utilized. The follow-up period was from six to 48 months. Ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 68 years. The postoperative regimen was six weeks nonweight-bearing in a short-leg cast, followed by weight bearing in a short-leg cast until union occurred. All fusions but one healed with an average period of 14 weeks of immobilization. No patient experienced wound healing difficulty or disruption of a superficial nerve. The authors believe that this is a simple technique that permits excellent visualization through a safe internervous interval, good bone apposition, rigid interfragmentary fixation and does not require the use of bone graft.\r"

The most appropriate procedure is Chuinard's fusion, which achieves a tibiotalar fusion without causing a growth arrest of the distal tibial growth plate. In the long term, young patients with ankle arthrodesis function very well with minimal pain or disability. Stressful activities such as hill climbing, stair climbing, and running may be restricted or require compensatory movements.\r"

A new method to achieve arthrodesis of the ankle that utilizes an anterior surgical approach and an anterior tension plate was assessed in 17 patients. This method transforms the potentially deforming force of the tendoachilles into a compressive and corrective force and facilitates realignment of the ankle in all planes. Also, dissection and subperiosteal elevation is minimized while soft tissue coverage of the hardware is maximized. Whereas the predominant preoperative diagnosis was posttraumatic degenerative joint disease, others included failed ankle arthroplasty, failed arthrodesis, and a fixed equinus deformity. A solid arthrodesis was achieved in 82% of the patients. Although complications occurred and two patients required reoperations, there were no problems with respect to wound healing or infection, which is a marked contrast to other series. This technique is recommended as a simple, safe, and effective method to achieve an arthrodesis of the ankle joint.\r"

The external fixation group had a significantly higher prevalence of complications, including non-union, delayed union, and infection, than the internal fixation group.

There was a significant correlation between mean esmolol concentrations and mean percentage of reductions of mean arterial pressures and heart rates at each sample time (p less than 0.001). The doses of esmolol required for beta-blockade (mean +/- SD, 535 +/- 180 micrograms/kg/min) in children were considerably higher than those typically used in adults.

In the West Greenlanders, 2.9% of the sample had S/R ratios of 0.90 or more and were accordingly phenotyped as poor metabolizers. The intraethnic difference with regard to the frequency of the mephenytoin poor metabolizer is probably attributable in part to a much higher proportion of admixed Caucasian genes in the West Greenlanders than in the East Greenlanders. In both the East and the West Greenlanders, the sparteine metabolic ratio displayed marked interindividual differences without a clear bimodal distribution. Poor metabolizers arbitrarily defined as subjects with an metabolic ratio of 20 or more made up 3.3% of the East Greenlanders and 2.3% of the West Greenlanders, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.\r"

Patients were evaluated by duodenal aspiration and biopsy and received both 25 gm oral and 10 gm intravenous doses of D-xylose. Kinetic analysis of D-xylose absorption was characterized by an absorption rate constant (ka) and a rate constant (ko) reflecting nonabsorptive loss. Extent of D-xylose absorption averaged 18.4% +/- 9.3% (+/- SD) in the 12 patients (normal greater than 60%). Percentage of weight loss during the previous 6 months was negatively correlated with ka (r = -0.69; p = 0.018) in the 11 patients in whom this parameter was reduced but was not correlated with either ko or extent of D-xylose absorption. In these patients with human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy, ka was reduced out of proportion to the minor histologic changes present in the duodenal biopsy specimens.\r"

Bioinequivalence among the five capsules was demonstrated. The relative cumulative excretion of mandelic acid of the most poorly bioavailable capsule was 38% of the most highly bioavailable capsule. The effect of food on the bioavailability of these two capsules was investigated by use of two different kinds of food, one containing fat and one containing high carbohydrates but very low fat. The bioavailability of the two capsules was increased when subjects consumed both types of food before drug administration, although there was a greater effect on bioavailability with food containing fat. This suggests that the absorption of cyclandelate was incomplete in fasting subjects, even from the capsule with the highest bioavailability. Bioinequivalence between the two capsules remained after postprandial drug administration.\r"

The caffeine metabolites used for this purpose were 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU), 1-methylxanthine (1X), and 1-methylurate (1U). The ratio AAMU/(AAMU + 1X + 1U), referred to as molar ratio or N-acetyltransferase, was compared with the ratio AAMU/1X. The results indicated that, for screening purposes, the acetylator phenotype can be determined by analysis of a 6-hour urine sample after a cup of coffee or strong tea or a can of caffeine-containing soft drink. The ratio AAMU/1X is the ratio of choice for the study of subjects in whom variability of xanthine oxidase can be neglected; use of the ratio AAMU/(AAMU + 1X + 1U) appears appropriate for special purposes. Gender, ethnic origin, habitual or moderate consumption of coffee, tea, soft drinks, or ethanol, or cigarette smoking have little if any effect on the caffeine tests for acetylator phenotyping.\r"

In study 1, 0.5% betaxolol, 0.6% metipranolol, and 0.5% timolol were tested in 16 subjects. Compared with placebo, all beta-blockers resulted in a significant systemic beta-blockade (p greater than 0.05); the increasing order of potency was betaxolol, metipranolol, and timolol. In study 2, 2% butylamino-phenoxy-propanol-acetate (BPPA; a noncardioselective but topically oculoselective drug) and 1% timolol were investigated in 12 subjects.

A controlled diet was started 4 days before initiation of treatment and continued throughout the study. For 14 days six volunteers received bilaterally one drop of 2% MK-927 (1.2 mg) q.i.d., six received one drop of 1.8% sezolamide (1.1 mg) q.i.d., and four received the common vehicle q.i.d. Blood and urine electrolytes and acid-base profiles were measured before and on days 1, 7, and 14 of treatment, and 24-hour urine samples were collected daily. All values were compared with those on the pretreatment day. Taking the circadian variations of the parameters into account, no significant treatment effect was observed in either the daily profiles or the 14-day cumulative sodium, potassium, and citrate excretions. Because the usual variability of the measured biologic parameters has been reduced markedly by the stringent requirements of this study, it can be concluded that the induction of clinically significant metabolic changes by topically administered MK-927 or sezolamide is unlikely.\r"

Our objective was to determine whether similar enhancement of analgesia could be demonstrated when caffeine is combined with ibuprofen. On a double-blind basis, a single oral dose of ibuprofen (50, 100, or 200 mg), a combination of ibuprofen, 100 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, a combination of ibuprofen, 200 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, or placebo was randomly assigned to 298 outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars. With a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 8 hours. All active treatments were significantly superior to placebo, and the caffeine effect was significant for every measure of analgesia. Relative potency estimates indicated that the combination was 2.4 to 2.8 times as potent as ibuprofen alone. The combination also had a more rapid onset and longer duration of analgesic action. The analgesic adjuvancy of caffeine clearly extends to combinations with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than acetaminophen or aspirin.\r"

As the proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogenic lectins has been linked to a dependence on extracellular Mg2+, the intracellular [Mg2+] was studied in lymphocytes stimulated with various mitogenic and non-mitogenic lectins. 3. Only lymphocytes treated with phytohaemagglutinin-L, a leucoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris that binds to tri- and tetra-antennary complex glycoproteins, showed a marked increase in intracellular [Mg2+]. This effect was partially inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine. The stimulation by different lectins of the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into lymphocytes was not correlated to the changes in intracellular [Mg2+]. 4. The proliferative response of lymphocytes to lectins is therefore not wholly dependent on a rise in intracellular [Mg2+].\r"

During pregnancy platelets have also been shown in vitro to be less susceptible to the inhibitory effects of prostacyclin. The cyclic nucleotide cyclic AMP has a key role as an inhibitory second messenger in platelets and mediates the inhibitory effects of prostacyclin. 2. We have studied cyclic AMP in relation to platelet behaviour in healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Non-pregnant young women were used as controls. 3. Pharmacological agents which increase levels of cyclic AMP were significantly less effective as inhibitors of platelet activation during pregnancy, but there was no difference between the healthy and hypertensive pregnant subjects. 4. Basal platelet cyclic AMP levels were the same in all three groups. However, the production of cyclic AMP in response to a range of adenylate cyclase stimulators was reduced during pregnancy, but again there was no difference between healthy and hypertensive pregnant subjects. 5. The reduction in platelet cyclic AMP levels in pregnancy occurred not only with those adenylate cyclase stimulators which operate via surface receptors, but also on direct stimulation of the enzyme with forskolin. 6. The most likely explanation of these observations is a reduction in the ability of the platelet adenylate cyclase enzyme to respond to stimulation of the third trimester of pregnancy. The consequent reduction in formation of the inhibitory second messenger cyclic AMP may in part be responsible for platelet activation in vivo during pregnancy. There does not appear to be a further difference in platelet cyclic AMP production in hypertensive pregnant women.\r"

Excessive electrically stimulated contractile activity or treatment of muscles with the mitochondrial inhibitor, 2,4-dinitrophenol, induced a substantial release of both creatine kinase and glutathione and a reduction in the total glutathione content of the muscle. The time course of this release and depletion indicates that the efflux of the two molecules is not directly related and that a reduction in muscle glutathione content does not occur before cytosolic enzyme release. 3. 2,4-Dinitrophenol-stimulated release of creatine kinase was significantly reduced by the omission of external calcium from the incubation media, but glutathione release and depletion was relatively unaffected by this. Deliberate elevation of the muscle intracellular calcium content with the calcium ionophore, A23187, induced a substantial loss of creatine kinase, but had no significant effect on the release of glutathione. 4. Muscle biopsies from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were found to have an elevated content of glutathione and an equivalent protein-thiol content compared with control subjects. 5. We conclude that, although release of glutathione from skeletal muscle occurs after excessive contractile activity or inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism, this is not a key step in the damaging processes leading to cytosolic enzyme release, neither is it relevant to the ongoing damage to skeletal muscle which occurs in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

Administration via the vertebral artery, a more direct route to the brainstem, did not appear to lower the threshold dose required to induce hypotension. Furthermore, pretreatment with hexamethonium did not inhibit the hypotensive response to nerve growth factor. 4. Administration of a second dose of nerve growth factor after recovery from the first injection produced little or no fall in blood pressure. Similarly, pretreatment with the mast cell degranulating agent, compound 48/80, rendered the animal refractory to nerve growth factor. 5. The fall in blood pressure induced by nerve growth factor was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with chlorpheniramine. 6. It is concluded that the fall in blood pressure induced by intravenous administration of pharmacological doses of nerve growth factor is mediated by vasoactive substances, particularly histamine, released from mast cells.\r"

To test the hypothesis that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus perceive the symptoms of hypoglycaemia to a greater extent when they are in the standing position than when they are in the lying position, we assessed symptoms of hypoglycaemia, as well as heart rate and plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations, in both positions during hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps on three occasions in seven patients. 2. Plasma glucose concentrations were clamped at 5.0 mmol/l (90 mg/dl) and 5.0 mmol/l on one occasion, at 5.0 mmol/l and 3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) on another occasion, and at 5.0 mmol/l and 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) on yet another occasion. 3. During euglycaemia there was no effect of position on the symptom panels used to assess the symptomatic response to hypoglycaemia. However, at the plasma glucose concentration of 2.8 mmol/l, total (P less than 0.003) and neurogenic (P less than 0.005), but not neuroglycopenic, hypoglycaemic symptom scores were higher with the patients in the standing than in the lying position. Increments in total hypoglycaemic symptom scores, over those during the corresponding euglycaemic phase, were 5 +/- 2 in the lying position and 11 +/- 2 in the standing position (means +/- SEM, P less than 0.01). 4. Thus patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus perceive symptoms of hypoglycaemia to a greater extent when they are in the standing position than when they are in the lying position because of enhanced neurogenic symptoms.\r"

The incorporation of isotope into colorectal tumour protein was measured in six patients, whose tumours were biopsied after the injection. Fractional rates of protein synthesis were calculated from the enrichment of leucine in protein and the average free leucine enrichment in plasma. The range of rates obtained was 17.2-33.9%/day, with a mean rate (+/- SEM) of 22.5 +/- 2.6%/day. 3. Tumour protein synthesis rates were also measured in 15 patients with breast cancer. The range of rates obtained was 5.3-15.9%/day, with a mean rate (+/- SEM) of 10.3 +/- 0.8%/day. These rates are significantly lower than those obtained with colorectal tumours (P less than 0.001). 4. In 9 of the breast cancer patients, protein synthesis was measured in multiple random biopsies taken from the same tumour. The mean (+/- SEM) difference between the highest and lowest rates in biopsies from the same tumour was only 1.1 +/- 0.3%/day. Only 13% of the variation in protein synthesis between separate tumours could be explained by sampling error because of variation within the tumour itself, the remainder being genuine variation between individual tumours.\r"

In adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle the extracellular noradrenaline levels were studied by microdialysis in the conscious dog and compared with the noradrenaline concentration in arterial plasma. 2. The experiments were performed with and without tyramine added to the perfusion medium, and noradrenaline was measured by a sensitive radioenzymic assay. 3. In the absence of tyramine, the interstitial noradrenaline levels in adipose tissue and skeletal muscles were similar to arterial blood concentrations, provided that the former were corrected for recovery. The recovery estimated from experiments in vitro averaged 16% at room temperature. 4. With tyramine added to the perfusates, noradrenaline levels increased 10-fold. Arterial noradrenaline concentrations did not change, indicating that noradrenaline was released only locally in the tissue. 5. Our results indicate that the microdialysis technique combined with a sensitive assay for measuring noradrenaline may be applicable to the assessment of local noradrenaline release in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. This may be of interest, especially in adipose tissue during physiological stimulation in which sympathetic activity is difficult to evaluate by other techniques.\r"

Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure the flare response induced by the electrophoresis, at various current strengths, of a ring of acetylcholine solution into dorsal foot skin. 2. Nineteen control subjects and 52 long-duration insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetic patients of similar age (20 without complications; 19 with laser-treated retinopathy; 13 with reduced vibration perception and retinopathy) were studied in order to investigate the possible attenuation of this defence mechanism in diabetes. 3. The maximal (1 mA) flare response [control median (interquartile range): 1.55 (1.16-2.06) arbitrary units] was reduced greatly in neuropathic patients [0.37 (0.24-0.66) arbitrary units; P less than or equal to 0.001 with respect to all other groups], especially those with a previous history of foot ulceration. The flare was also reduced in some patients with retinopathy alone [1.06 (0.56-1.27) arbitrary units; P less than 0.005 with respect to control subjects]. 4. No rightward shift of the curve of hyperaemic response plotted against current strength was found, suggesting that the abnormal response was due to axonal loss rather than to dysfunction. 5. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by small pain fibres, was markedly impaired in a group of diabetic patients at risk of foot ulceration. Furthermore, impairment of this nociceptor C fibre response can develop before clinical large-fibre neuropathy and could itself predispose to foot complications.\r"

All subjects were male, between 20 and 40 years old, and in steady state with respect to body weight and physical activity patterns. Dietary analysis was undertaken using a 7-day weighed food intake. Correlations were sought between antioxidants in blood and (1) weekly training distance and (2) maximum oxygen uptake. In addition, 12 runners could be classified into two groups undertaking either low (range 16-43 km, n = 6) or high (80-147 km, n = 6) weekly training. 2. Body weight (range 55.3-90.0 kg) and percentage body fat (range 7-19%) both showed negative correlations with the weekly training distance (both P less than 0.001). Energy intake and maximum oxygen uptake were both correlated with the weekly training distance (both P less than 0.001). 3. Plasma creatine kinase activity, an indicator of muscle damage, was significantly correlated with the weekly training distance (P less than 0.01), whereas the plasma concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, an indicator of free-radical-mediated lipid peroxidation, decreased with increased maximum oxygen uptake (P less than 0.01). 4. Erythrocyte alpha-tocopherol content was greater in the two running groups (P less than 0.05) compared with the sedentary group, and lymphocyte ascorbic acid concentration was significantly elevated in the high-training group (P less than 0.01) compared with the low-training group. 5. Erythrocyte activities of the antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, were significantly and positively correlated with the weekly training distance (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As yet, it is unclear which of the two substrates (ornithine or alpha-ketoglutarate) is responsible for the anticatabolic effect. We infused alpha-ketoglutarate into anaesthetized post-operative dogs in order to investigate whether infusion of alpha-ketoglutarate affects the flux of glutamine and glutamate between skeletal muscle and the splanchnic bed. We used three infusion rates: 3, 10 and 20 mumol min-1 kg-1. A steady state of alpha-ketoglutarate concentration in arterial whole-blood was attained only when the infusion rate was 3 mumol min-1 kg-1. 2. Arterial whole-blood concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate were 8.8 +/- 1.2 mumol/l in the basal period and rose to 208 +/- 41, 344 +/- 61 and 1418 +/- 315 mumol/l after 60 min infusions of alpha-ketoglutarate at 3, 10 and 20 mumol min-1 kg-1, respectively. 3. alpha-Ketoglutarate uptake was measured in skeletal muscle, liver, gut and kidneys in the basal period and during the infusion of alpha-ketoglutarate. The net uptake of infused alpha-ketoglutarate was highest in the skeletal muscle, followed by kidneys, liver and gut. 4. The alpha-ketoglutarate load increased the muscular tissue content of alpha-ketoglutarate from 49.5 +/- 5 to 142 +/- 15 nmol/g of dry substance (P less than 0.001), but did not alter the muscular glutamate or glutamine contents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Resting energy expenditure was assessed in 14 patients with stable chronic cardiac failure and 14 matched control subjects by using indirect calorimetry. 2. Resting energy expenditure was significantly elevated in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (112.6 +/- 18.1 versus 87.1 +/- 12.2 kJ day-1 kg-1 total body weight, P less than 0.0002; mean +/- SD) as were resting O2 consumption (3.88 +/- 0.64 versus 3.00 +/- 0.43 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0002), ventilation (164 +/- 40.3 versus 104 +/- 16.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0001) and heart rate (85.8 +/- 16.9 versus 66.6 +/- 6.9 beats/min, P less than 0.001). Both the resting plasma concentration of noradrenaline (4.48 +/- 1.52 versus 2.28 +/- 0.96 nmol/l, P less than 0.0001) and the serum concentration of free fatty acids (0.78 +/- 0.21 versus 0.57 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, P less than 0.03) were greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Analysis of covariance indicated that most of the difference in resting energy expenditure could be accounted for by the elevated ventilation in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Arm muscle area, an index of wasting, was lower in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (39.1 +/- 13.1 versus 50.5 +/- 9.4 cm2, P less than 0.02) and resting energy expenditure was found to account for some of this difference. 3.

We also investigated whether the hyperinflated native lung in SLT-OB recipients could limit normal increases in tidal volume by mechanically constraining the transplanted lung, resulting in ventilation-perfusion imbalance in the lung graft. Data from six SLT-OB recipients (five women, one man) and six age-matched SLT recipients (two women, four men) with severe interstitial lung disease (SLT-IN) were compared. Resting arterial O2 and CO2 tensions were normal and comparable between the SLT groups. Spirometry results were reduced but comparable between SLT groups. Total lung capacity was significantly larger in patients with SLT-OB than in patients with SLT-IN. Diffusion capacity was not different between SLT groups when differences in alveolar volume were accounted for. Quantitative perfusion to the lung graft was comparable between the SLT groups, but quantitative ventilation was greater in patients with SLT-OB than in patients with SLT-IN. Maximum exercise capacity following SLT-OB was decreased, but was comparable to that of SLT-IN recipients. None of the SLT-OB recipients reached predicted maximum minute ventilation and only one experienced mild arterial O2 desaturation, suggesting peripheral muscle abnormalities from corticosteroid use and deconditioning as limiting factors rather than a ventilatory limitation. Tidal volumes at end exercise in the SLT-OB recipients were normal. Our quantitative lung scan and exercise testing data suggest that ventilation-perfusion imbalance and resulting gas exchange abnormalities from lung graft constraint and compression do not occur at rest or with exercise after SLT for obstructive lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relationship between the lung function of 74 individuals with a history of poliomyelitis and reports of shortness of breath during activities of daily living, and the presence of post-polio sequelae risk factors. First, we studied the spirometry of 60 individuals (group 1) and second, we studied the relationship between the spirometry of an additional 14 individuals (group 2) and their respiratory muscle strength (Pimax and Pemax). In both groups, we examined the relationship between factors associated with post-polio sequelae including ventilation at polio-onset, having contracted polio after the age of 10, and having had polio for over 35 years; and lung function. In group 1, the FEV1 and FVC were lower for individuals with shortness of breath than individuals without (p less than 0.01). With respect to risk factors, FEV1 and FVC were lower in individuals who were ventilated at polio-onset, in individuals who contracted polio over 10 years of age, and in individuals who had had polio for less, rather than more than 35 years (p less than 0.05). The results for group 2 were comparable to group 1. In addition, the observed Pimax and Pemax were significantly lower than predicted values (p less than 0.05). Although FEV1 and FVC were positively correlated with both Pimax and Pemax (p less than 0.05), Pemax was disproportionately impaired compared to Pimax (40 +/- 12.1 and 82 +/- 38.8 percent predicted respectively). We conclude that individuals with a history of poliomyelitis can have compromised lung function irrespective of shortness of breath, that risk factors such as ventilation at polio-onset and polio-onset after 10 years of age can help predict those at risk of respiratory compromise, and that the measurement of respiratory muscle strength and of Pemax in particular, can augment the assessment of lung function of these individuals. Such assessment may avert respiratory complications in the post poliomyelitis population including those secondary to health care interventions.\r"

Reactivation of TB was associated with formation of BPF and recovery of drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum. All patients had recurrence of positive sputum cultures that yielded tubercle bacilli resistant to drugs they were receiving. The lungs demonstrated gross thickening with calcification of both visceral and parietal pleura. Two patients underwent retreatment chemotherapy followed by decortication-empyemectomy and lung resection surgery; both are now culture-negative for TB. One patient received retreatment chemotherapy but refused surgery; he remains clinically stable with negative sputum cultures. Two other patients' organisms became drug-resistant and they remain sputum-culture positive. We believe that thick, calcified pleural walls limit penetration of drugs into the infected empyema space, resulting in suboptimal drug concentrations and drug resistance. Intensified chemotherapy and surgical intervention should be considered in these cases.\r"

Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day. Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation. Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation. Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association.\r"

Ex-smokers had a greater percentage of PMN compared with nonsmokers and current smokers. The subjects were subgrouped with respect to biopsy-detected metaplasia. There was no difference between these groups for percentage or total number of PMN in the first aliquot. However, subjects with metaplasia had significant reduction in FEV1/FVC compared with those without. We conclude that there are significant differences in cells between the first and subsequent aliquots.

These abnormalities included focal parenchymal opacities, IIM, enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, new solitary pulmonary nodule and pneumothorax. Subsequent antibiotic use correlated with radiographic focal opacities or IIM, even in afebrile patients, but did not correlate with elevated blood leukocyte count. Based on the evidence of in-hospital alteration of management independent of elevated blood leukocyte count and body temperature, we recommend that chest radiographs be obtained for all adult patients admitted because of acute asthma.\r"

Accuracy of this device was determined by comparison of CO results obtained from the Velcom-100 (COV) against those of conventional thermal dilution cardiac output (COT) measurements. Twenty-six postoperative patients were used for this study, ranging in age from 20 to 82 years old. Initial studies prior to in vivo standardization demonstrated a significantly lower result (p = 0.039) for the Velcom-100 with a mean difference of 0.86 L/min (COT-COV). This comparison was significantly improved in subsequent studies following in vivo standardization (COT-COV = 0.02 L/min, p = 0.646). Linear regression analysis showed a significant, positive correlation between the two results (r = 0.82, p less than 0.05) indicating an excellent trending capability for the Velcom-100. Our evaluation found the Velcom-100 to be user friendly, allowing rapid training of ICU technicians and applicability for postoperative monitoring.\r"

Whereas daytime Po2 and the amplitude of desaturations during sleep remained equal, overall oxygenation during sleep improved slightly (mean SaO2 night A = 90.6 +/- 0.9 percent; night B = 92.8 +/- 0.5 percent; p less than 0.05). Differences between nights A and B were more prominent the more severe sleep apnea had been prior to treatment and could not be explained by weight loss. There was strong correlation between improvements in oxygenation measurements and the daily time of NCPAP use. In conclusion, we found a subgroup of OSA patients receiving long-term NCPAP therapy with less disturbed ventilation during sleep following use of NCPAP for only the first part of the night, but in the majority of patients, sleep disordered breathing off NCPAP remained unchanged.\r"

Both the HME and HH groups were similar with respect to age, sex, diagnosis, duration of MV, SAPS and mortality. Temperature of gases in the tracheal tube was lower and the amount of tracheal instillations was greater in the HME group than in the HH group. Tracheal secretions became thicker between day 1 (control) and day 5, in the HME group than in the HH group. Four and two tube occlusions occurred in HME and HH groups, respectively. Tracheal bacterial colonization was similar in the two groups. Given the advantages of HME (reduced nurses' work and financial cost), HME could be routinely used under cautious surveillance and replaced by HH if difficulty in suctioning occurs.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the excess mortality attributable to hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, we applied the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II classification to 34 critically ill patients with this complication. The study included primary bloodstream infections, defined by a positive blood culture at least three days after hospitalization, in the absence of any other apparent source of infection. The most frequent blood isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (39 percent), Gram-negative rods (24 percent), and Candida albicans (15 percent); the spectrum of blood isolates suggested that most infections were related to intravascular catheters. In a control group of intensive care unit patients (n = 384), the death rate predicted by APACHE II was similar to the observed death rate (35.3 vs 37.8 percent). In a subgroup of control patients (n = 34), chosen for APACHE II scores that matched the patients with bloodstream infections, predicted and observed death rates were also similar (53.1 vs 52.9 percent). For patients with bloodstream infections, however, observed mortality (82.4 percent) significantly exceeded the predicted value (54.1 percent, p = 0.025). We conclude that critically ill patients who develop nosocomial bloodstream infections are at greater risk of death than patients with comparable severity of illness without this complication. The difference between the observed and predicted death rates, 28 percent, represents the excess mortality associated with bloodstream infection in critically ill patients.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is often performed in modern critical care units, but its efficacy has not been evaluated in this setting. It is important to evaluate CPR in critical care units because these patients often have multisystem disorders and suffer from diseases reported to carry a poor outcome after CPR. Inappropriate resuscitation of patients in this setting results in increased cost of care (both financial and emotional), with little tangible benefit. To address the question of successful resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), we retrospectively reviewed the records of 114 patients who underwent CPR in our MICU over a three-year period. Eighty patients (70 percent) were not successfully resuscitated, 21 patients (18 percent) were successfully resuscitated but died before discharge, and 13 patients (11 percent) survived to leave the hospital. We evaluated a number of prearrest conditions (diagnoses, age, sex, duration of hospitalization, length of ICU stay, and severity of illness as measured by APACHE 2 scores) and arrest conditions (the initial cardiac rhythm and duration of CPR) to determine if the outcome after CPR was influenced by any of these parameters. Among the prearrest conditions, only a diagnosis of hypotension or sepsis and an elevated APACHE 2 acute physiology score were independently associated with a poor outcome after CPR. The only arrest condition found to be independently associated with outcome following CPR was the duration of resuscitative effort (p less than 0.01). The patients who were successfully resuscitated but died before discharge were not different from the patients who were not successfully resuscitated in any parameter that we evaluated. These results demonstrate that CPR can be successful in the MICU and that there are prearrest and arrest parameters which are useful in identifying those patients most likely to benefit from CPR in the critical care setting.\r"

  ".W": "Methacholine challenges were performed in ten subjects with mild asthma at 2 h before and 20 min after placebo or 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg of inhaled verapamil given in a single-blind randomized crossover manner on different days. While verapamil did not have a bronchodilator effect, the 10-mg dose modestly increased the concentration of methacholine required to decrease FEV1 by 20 percent (PC20). The mean (+/- SEM) increase in PC20 from baseline was 2.1 +/- 0.2 times baseline after 10 mg of verapamil, compared to 1.1 +/- 0.1 times baseline after placebo (p less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, bronchoconstriction (greater than 10 percent decrease in FEV1) associated with cough or wheezing was observed in seven of ten subjects at doses of 20 mg or more. This adverse effect was not related to the osmolarity of the nebulized solutions. Thirty minutes before a standardized exercise challenge, 13 subjects inhaled placebo, 10 mg, or the highest dose of verapamil tolerated during the methacholine study (20 to 160 mg) in a double-blind randomized crossover manner. The exercise challenge was aborted in three subjects because of bronchospasm that occurred after administration of the higher dose. The mean (+/- SEM) maximum change in FEV1 after exercise in the ten subjects completing all three regimens of treatment was -17.1 +/- 4.0 percent after placebo, -12.7 +/- 4.3 percent after 10 mg (p less than 0.05), and -6.4 +/- 3.6 percent after the highest dose (p less than 0.05). We conclude that increasing the dose of verapamil above 10 mg did not provide greater benefit but, paradoxically, induced bronchoconstriction in most of the subjects. Because of this potential bronchoconstrictor effect, high doses of oral or intravenous verapamil should be used with caution in asthmatic subjects.\r"

Furthermore, sniff Pes can be estimated noninvasively by the measurement of sniff Pmo in normal subjects and in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. The aim of this study was to compare sniff Pmo and P.PImax to assess inspiratory muscle strength in patients with acute respiratory failure. The highest pressure was produced by P.PImax in 61 percent of measurements, and by sniff Pmo in 39 percent. Above 35 cm H2O P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 55 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 1.20 +/- 0.54. Below 35 cm H2O, P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 75 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 0.76 +/- 0.35 (p less than 0.02). Thus, measurements of sniff Pmo and P.PImax complement one another for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. However, sniff Pmo underestimates inspiratory muscle strength in patients with severe inspiratory muscle weakness.\r"

We attempted to correlate electrophysiologic and anatomic differences between the pig and human CS. Invasive electrophysiologic studies were performed in five healthy anesthetized pigs. In contrast to the adult human, the pig has sinus tachycardia, shortened PR and H-V intervals, and a relatively short sinoatrial conduction time. Compared with the human CS, serial sections of the CS of pig hearts showed the following differences: (1) the atrioventricular node is located more to the right of the summit of the ventricular septum; (2) the penetrating bundle is very short, and the bifurcation of the bundle into bundle branches occurs more proximally; (3) there is more connective tissue and less elastic tissue; and (4) there is a copious amount of nerve fibers (about 50 percent throughout the CS). The presence of the abundant neural tissue implies that there is an important neurogenic component to conduction in the pig. Because of the above differences from the human, the pig should be used with caution as an experimental model in ischemic heart disease and sudden death where arrhythmias are studied.\r"

To study the characteristic exercise test variables in patients with left main coronary artery disease, the computerized data base of the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology Exercise Test Laboratory was used. Among 2,378 patients who had undergone a supine bicycle exercise test and who had abnormal coronary angiographic results, 65 patients with significant (greater than 50 percent diameter narrowing) stenosis of the left main coronary artery were found. The 65 patients were subgrouped according to their previous history and other vessel involvement. Nine patients had isolated left main coronary artery disease and no myocardial infarction (group 1); 28 patients had left main coronary artery stenosis and another diseased vessel but no prior myocardial infarction (MI) (group 2); and 28 patients had left main coronary artery disease, another diseased vessel, and a prior MI (group 3). For comparison, the 27 patients selected to be the control group (group C) had no history of MI but had significant stenosis of both the left anterior descending and the left circumflex arteries. Exercise time, calculated oxygen consumption, maximal work load, time to ST depression, prevalence of ST segment depression, and maximal ST depression were similar in the groups. Maximal heart rate and double product were higher in group 1, but we could find no single variable or group of variables characteristic of left main coronary artery disease.\r"

Cardiac catheterization demonstrated single vessel critical stenosis at the origin of the sinus node artery. Combined atrial and ventricular infarction occurs frequently and should be considered in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias occurring early in the course of ventricular myocardial infarction. Lone atrial infarction is a rare but distinct clinical entity. The tetrad of typical ischemic chest discomfort, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia, P-Ta segment shifts, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels without evidence for ventricular infarction strongly suggests isolated atrial infarction.\r"

Ejection fraction was calculated from digitized biapical echocardiographic views on a graphics tablet. Changes of 0.10 or more in LVEF were correlated with 23 clinical variables. By stepwise regression analysis, Q-wave infarction and low early LVEF independently predicted late improvement in function. Early high LVEF and interval infarction were the only independent predictors of late declines in function. Overall, when patients were indexed by early left ventricular systolic function, a pronounced late \"regression to the mean\" was noted with initially high values tending to fall and low values to rise (r = -0.44, p less than 0.001). This effect must be accounted for in any acute intervention trial in myocardial infarction. The occurrence of Q-wave infarction does not exclude late improvement in ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically apparent myocardial disease is infrequent in sarcoidosis. However, autopsy data show myocardial involvement in up to 30 percent of patients. Unexplained exertional symptomatology is a common complaint in patients with sarcoidosis. In this study, we investigated whether abnormal cardiac function might limit exercise performance in patients with sarcoidosis without overt cardiac involvement. We studied exercise responses in 35 patients with sarcoidosis and compared them with 28 untrained controls. Seventy-seven percent of the patients were symptomatic. Pulmonary function test results were lower in the group with sarcoidosis than normal controls, but they were within normal range. Only one patient had evidence of ventilatory limitation to exercise. Sixteen (46 percent) patients had abnormally increased heart rates (HRs) at rest prior to exercise testing and/or with exercise. Rapid HRs were confirmed during daily activities by continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured to determine if systolic dysfunction could account for abnormal HR responses. Of patients with abnormally increased HRs, five had LVEFs less than 50 percent, and eight had normal LVEFs, of whom 75 percent had tachycardia at rest. Retrospective comparison of HR responses and LVEF between patients who did or did not receive corticosteroids revealed no significant differences between groups. We conclude that abnormal HR responses in patients without evident cardiac sarcoidosis are common and exertional symptoms in this population are often associated with chronotropic abnormalities. The exact mechanisms underlying the chronotropic abnormalities are unclear, but they likely include ventricular systolic dysfunction, sinus node dysfunction from granulomatous infiltration, or combinations of the two.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the extent to which patterns of diagnostic and therapeutic practice differ among hospitals caring for acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in a single city. DESIGN: Our study comprised a retrospective review of the records of patients admitted to the hospital for the treatment of acute asthma. SETTING: Three large teaching hospitals in Boston were the setting. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients between 18 and 50 years of age who were admitted to the medical services specifically for the treatment of asthma were studied. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For this group of patients with similar histories of asthma, clinical presentation, and severity of asthma, the diagnostic tests used within 12 hours of admission and the frequency and volume of diagnostic laboratory testing throughout the admission differed significantly among the three hospitals. Spirometry, the test bearing most directly on the severity of the asthmatic attack, was not used routinely as a criterion for admission or discharge at any of the hospitals. Other tests of uncertain efficacy, such as chest x-ray films, were used frequently at some of the hospitals. Patients at all three hospitals were treated similarly with intensive combined regimens of methylxanthines, sympathomimetics, and corticosteroids and had similar mean lengths of stay. The use of chest physical therapy, which has not yet been demonstrated to be effective in acute asthma, differed significantly among the three hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that considerable variability exists in the diagnostic evaluation of acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in the three hospitals; little variability exists in the pharmacologic treatment of these patients. In the absence of data on outcome regarding functional improvement and reductions in morbidity, we are unable to recommend a preferred pattern of practice from this study.\r"

The prevalence of OA was 36 percent. Peak flows were interpreted by two observers blinded to other results. Criteria for a PEFR interpretation of OA were as follow: diurnal variation greater than or equal to 20 percent relatively more frequently or with greater variation on working days than days off work. With the objective diagnoses as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the PEFR interpretations was 72 percent for OA; specificity for no asthma was 53 percent. Excluding those with greater than or equal to 20 percent variation on only one day sensitivity improved to 93 percent for OA, and specificity to 77 percent. There was an acceptable level of interobserver variation (kappa 62 to 83 percent). We conclude that simple objective criteria for PEFR interpretation can be developed with acceptable interobserver variation.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Computerized bibliographic search of published and unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: Independent review of 48 randomized controlled trials of prophylaxis identified eight relevant studies. DATA ABSTRACTION: The population, intervention, and outcomes were evaluated by duplicate independent review. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia was lower in critically ill patients receiving antacids and/or histamine-2-receptor antagonists as compared with patients receiving no stress ulcer prophylaxis (common odds ratio 0.42, 95 percent CI 0.17 to 1.11). When stress ulcer prophylactic therapy was titrated to achieve a gastric pH of 3.5 or greater, there was a trend favoring a decreased incidence of pneumonia (0.66, 95 percent CI 0.24 to 1.78). In trials comparing sucralfate with pH-altering drugs, the common odds ratio of 0.55 (0.28 to 1.06) suggests a 45 percent risk reduction with the use of sucralfate. CONCLUSION: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with drugs which raise gastric pH does not increase the incidence of pneumonia in comparison to placebo or control therapy. The use of sucralfate is associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in comparison to agents which raise gastric pH. However, methodologic deficiencies, small sample sizes, and the failure to examine the effects of antacids and histamine-2-receptor antagonists separately make a large prospective randomized trial necessary to confirm or refute these findings.\r"

  ".W": "Aggregation of cases of bronchial asthma in adult twin pairs was studied in the nationwide Finnish twin cohort consisting of 13,888 adult monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) pairs. Cases of asthma were ascertained by record-linkage from three sources of data: death certificates from the Central Statistical Office; hospital discharges from the nationwide hospital registry; and the nationwide registry for fully reimbursed medications of the Social Insurance Institution. A diagnosis of bronchial asthma in one or more of these registers was obtained for 525 (236 men and 289 women) out of 27,776 twin individuals. Among MZ pairs, ten concordant and 138 discordant pairs were identified, while among DZ pairs, 12 concordant and 343 discordant pairs were found. In the whole sample the observed-expected ratio for the number of pairs concordant for bronchial asthma was 4.30 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.06 to 7.90) in MZ pairs and 2.61 (95 percent CI, 1.35 to 4.56) in DZ pairs. Using a multifactorial threshold model, we estimated the correlation in liability to asthma as 0.425 (SE = 0.07) in MZ twins and 0.247 (SE = 0.06) in DZ twins, and we obtained a heritability estimate of 35.6 percent. The data also showed a gender difference in asthma heredity, which may, however, be due to chance events affecting the distribution of concordant pairs.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether a simple test, such as routine roentgenographic views of the upper airway, is useful in identifying anatomic narrowing of the airway in patients with sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we prospectively studied a group of 117 patients (95 male and 22 female subjects) referred for evaluation of heavy snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea. All patients had full nocturnal polysomnography, including measurements of snoring. Lateral view of the airway obtained after swallowing contrast material was used to measure pharyngeal diameters at three sites along the airway. All measurements were performed with the patients standing and supine. We used three different definitions of sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index of 10, 20, and 40), and compared airway diameters between the apneic and nonapneic snorers. Only when sleep apnea was defined as greater than 40 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep was there a significant difference in airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it between apneic and nonapneic snorers. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the retropalatal distance on assumption of the supine posture. Stepwise, forward, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the retropalatal distance and airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it were significant predictors of snoring, but not apnea. We conclude that (1) airway diameters account for some of the variability in snoring, and (2) they do not differentiate between apneic and nonapneic snorers.\r"

To determine the clinical presentation and sequelae of SPM, data were obtained from 25 patients: 14 from Hadassah University Hospital, and 11 from other medical institutions. The mean age was 18.8 +/- 5.2 years (+/- SD), with a range of 8 to 31 years. The most common presenting complaint was retrosternal pain in 22 patients (88 percent), dyspnea in 15 (60 percent), dysphagia in 10 (40 percent), and weakness in 10 (40 percent). Predisposing factors for the development of SPM could be identified in 18 patients (72 percent). Information on the sequelae of SPM during a mean period of 87.4 +/- 38.0 months following the initial SPM episode was obtained from 23 patients. Recurrent SPM occurred in 1 patient at 18 months, and another patient experienced 4 episodes of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. No other long-term sequelae were reported. We conclude that SPM is a benign self-limited disease with diverse clinical manifestations. Although uncommon, recurrences of SPM may be observed.\r"

DESIGN: All patients with sarcoidosis or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis seen during a four-week period were studied. In a second study to relate ausculatory findings to anatomy, patients with fibrotic changes on their chest roentgenogram were studied. SETTING: Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: In the first part, all patients seen over the course of one month were studied. In the second study, patients with pulmonary fibrosis seen on chest roentgenograms were studied. INTERVENTIONS: For the first study, two independent observers performed auscultation on five sites for crackles and reviewed four roentgenogram quadrants for changes. For the second study, patients underwent VC measurements, auscultation, and high resolution computer tomography scans. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: For the first study, crackles were noted at greater than 2 sites in all 11 CFA patients, but only one of 17 SARC patients (p less than 0.001). Roentgenogram changes were seen in greater than 2 quadrants in nine of 11 CFA patients and eight of 17 SARC patients (p = ns). In the second study, the VC was similar in the two groups: SARC: 1.96 +/- .90 L (means +/- SD), 58 +/- 20.4 percent predicted; CFA: 1.81 +/- .33 L, 59 +/- 9.2 percent predicted). Only two of 14 SARC patients had crackles in greater than 1 area, while all 14 CFA patients had crackles at greater than 2 sites. The HRCT studies were read by a radiologist unaware of the diagnosis. The presence and degree (0 to 3 scale) of subpleural and peribronchial fibrosis were scored. Twelve SARC patients had peribronchial changes (mean score 1.9 +/- 1.08), while only eight had subpleural fibrosis (mean score .6 +/- .52). There was a significantly different pattern in the CFA patients, where eight had peribronchial fibrosis (mean score = .9 +/- .78, p less than 0.05) and all 14 had subpleural fibrosis (mean score = 1.6 +/- .73, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that crackles are more frequent in fibrosing alveolitis than in sarcoidosis; this difference may be due to the distribution of parenchymal fibrosis.\r"

Currently, no study has reported on the incidence of this disorder in Mexican Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the 8-yr incidence of type II diabetes in 617 Mexican Americans and 306 non-Hispanic whites who participated in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Forty Mexican Americans (6.5%) and 6 non-Hispanic whites (2%) developed type II diabetes, as defined by World Health Organization criteria. The age-adjusted ethnic odds ratio (OR; Mexican Americans/non-Hispanic whites) for diabetes incidence was 8.13 (95% confidence interval [C1] 1.10-59.9) in men and 3.62 (95% CI 1.37-9.55) in women. We adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, and level of educational attainment with multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Mexican Americans continued to show a statistically significant increase in diabetes incidence (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.28). Obesity and age were also positively related to diabetes incidence in this analysis (P less than 0.001). In addition, subjects with at least some college education had a lower incidence of diabetes than those with less than a high school education (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of type II diabetes in Mexican Americans is greater than in non-Hispanic whites, a difference that is not explained by ethnic differences in obesity, age, or level of educational attainment.\r"

To examine whether this reflects cerebral adaptation to low blood glucose levels, we investigated the effect of preceding glycemic experience on hormonal, EEG, and evoked potential responses to experimentally induced hypoglycemia with the slow-fall clamp. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three groups were examined: well-controlled diabetic patients and patients with insulinoma (group 1), poorly controlled diabetic patients (group 2), and nondiabetic subjects (group 3). RESULTS: The glucose threshold for epinephrine release was lower in group 1 (2.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 mM, P less than 0.02), and the peak epinephrine response was reduced (1.29 +/- 0.36 vs. 5.48 +/- 1 and 5.62 +/- 1.2 nM, P less than 0.01) compared with groups 2 and 3, whereas symptoms were not perceived until a lower blood glucose level had been reached (2.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.4 and 2.6 +/- 0.2 mM, P less than 0.01). Other counterregulatory responses were similarly delayed and diminished. In contrast, EEG changes that were compatible with hypoglycemia were detected in all subjects in group 1 (blood glucose 1.9 +/- 0.1 mM) but in only two in group 2 and none in group 3, despite similar blood glucose nadirs. CONCLUSIONS: The glycemic threshold for hormonal responses to hypoglycemia falls in individuals with intensively treated diabetes or insulinomas, but these patients are more likely to develop EEG abnormalities during hypoglycemia. This disparity helps explain the increased vulnerability of intensively treated patients to severe hypoglycemia.\r"

Baseline examinations were conducted on 996 younger- and 1370 older-onset subjects. Incidence of retinopathy was based on 138 younger-onset and 154 older-onset insulin-taking subjects and 321 older-onset non-insulin-taking subjects who were free of retinopathy at baseline. Progression of retinopathy was based on 530 younger-onset and 418 older-onset insulin-taking subjects and 486 older-onset non-insulin-taking subjects with less than proliferative diabetic retinopathy at baseline. RESULTS: Baseline smoking history was categorized by status (nonsmoker, ex-smoker, current smoker) and pack-years smoked while diabetic. Retinopathy was documented by stereoscopic fundus photography. In univariate analyses, the only significant association was between pack-years and progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy in older-onset insulin-taking subjects (P less than 0.01). After controlling for known risk factors for the incidence and progression of retinopathy, pack-years smoked was borderline significant (P = 0.052) in predicting incidence of retinopathy in younger-onset subjects. Smoking was not associated with incidence in older-onset subjects or with progression or progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy in any of the groups.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred forty NIDDM patients with apoE4 or apoE3/3 who had either hypercholesterolemia or normolipidemia were studied. ApoE phenotypes were determined by isoelectric focusing method. RESULTS: The apoE4-carrying NIDDM patients with hypercholesterolemia (n = 39) showed significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (8.4 vs. 7.2 mM, P less than 0.05), HbA1 (9.3 vs. 8.1%, P less than 0.05), and percentage of ideal body weight values (116 vs. 102%, P less than 0.01) than the apoE4-carrying NIDDM patients with normolipidemia (n = 26), whereas there was no significant difference in their levels between the apoE3/3-carrying NIDDM patients with hypercholesterolemia (n = 47) and normolipidemia (n = 128). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our previous finding, this study indicates that hypercholesterolemia in apoE4-carrying NIDDM patients may be more closely related to poor metabolic control and increased percentage of ideal body weight.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective randomized crossover trial with two 3-mo periods, one with SMBG recorded on traditional booklets (booklet period) and another with computerized SMBG transmitted to a central data base through a telematic network (telematic period), comprised the study. During the latter phase, patients could receive computerized SMBG analysis on individual terminals connected to the telephone network (Minitel system). Blood glucose recordings and HbA1c were measured at inclusion and end of each period. Eleven pairs of IDDM patients on intensified insulin therapy were randomized within each pair to start with the telematic period (group A) or the booklet period (group B). RESULTS: Telematic transmissions were successful (less than 1% failure rate). Although initial HbA1c was low (6.7%), it declined during the telematic period (delta = -0.41%) compared with the booklet period (delta = +0.37%, P = 0.05). The percentage of low (less than 3.3 mM) blood glucose values correlated with HbA1c changes during the telematic period (r = 0.714, P = 0.0014) but not the booklet period. The patients favored the telematic tool to analyze SMBG. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic transmission of SMBG is feasible. It can improve SMBG analysis and perhaps glucose control, therefore offering a new way of communication between diabetic patients and their physicians.\r"

RESULTS: Color discrimination ability decreased with age, diabetes duration, and presence of retinopathy. It was independent of the degree of glycemia and accuracy of self-monitoring of blood glucose.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The reproducibility of glucose and insulin responses to a mixed meal were studied in 24 consecutive non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic patients, the diet of which matched the tested diet. Patients received their usual treatment throughout the study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A standardized diet was followed for 3 days, and responses were measured on the 2nd and 3rd days. Glucose and insulin responses were studied after lunches with the 180-min positive area under the curve, and were analyzed with paired t test and Pearson's linear regression. RESULTS: Glucose responses did not vary (217 +/- 50 vs. 217 +/- 38 min x mM, NS) and were significantly correlated (r = 0.64, P less than 0.01). Insulin responses did not vary (35,224 +/- 5768 vs. 35,305 +/- 7779 min x pM, NS) and were strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that glucose and insulin responses to a test meal are reproducible in type II diabetic patients.\r"

Although their role in controlling cell growth is not well understood, they have been implicated in derangements of cellular proliferation that occur in diabetes, e.g., mesangial cell hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. Because several growth factors have been structurally characterized and the cell types on which they act identified, research is focusing on developing model systems to determine whether they are involved in the pathogenesis of specific disease states. New techniques, i.e., in situ hybridization, gene transfection, and detailed structural analysis of proteins, have made it possible to define both changes in the relative abundance of specific growth factors and potential changes in their actions in specific disease states. These techniques are being applied in diabetes research and will make it possible to determine the alterations that have occurred in growth factor synthesis and growth factor-matrix protein interaction and cell-type-specific alterations in cell growth that occur after loss of normal glucose homeostasis. The findings from these types of analyses should lead to a better understanding of how the complications of diabetes develop and rational strategies to control their effects.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells form the luminal vascular surface and thus have a central role in the regulation of coagulation. One important way in which endothelial cells control the clotting system is by regulating the expression of binding sites for anticoagulant and procoagulant factors on the cell surface. In the quiescent state, endothelial cells maintain blood fluidity by promoting the activity of numerous anticoagulant pathways, including the protein C/protein S pathway. After activation, as can be brought about by cytokines, the balance of endothelial properties can be tipped to favor clot formation through coordinated induction of procoagulant and suppression of anticoagulant mechanisms. Tumor necrosis factor suppresses the endothelial anticoagulant cofactor thrombomodulin and induces expression of the procoagulant cofactor tissue factor. Working in concert, these changes can allow fibrin formation to proceed in an inflamed focus but maintain blood fluidity in the surrounding area of normal vasculature. Recent studies suggest that similar changes in endothelial coagulant properties can be induced by advanced glycosylation end products, proteins modified by glucose that accumulate in the vasculature at a rapid rate in diabetic subjects, indicating the potential relevance of these mechanisms in diabetic vascular disease.\r"

A MEDLINE search (1986 through Sept. 1989) was performed to update previous relevant references on vWF and ECs in healthy and diabetic subjects. Main data in the literature and personal contributions were scrutinized. Study quality, information, and relevance to the subject were assessed. vWF is synthesized and stored mainly in ECs. Its plasma levels are increased in diabetic microangiopathy but are not influenced by circulating glucose, insulin, or growth hormone, nor do they acutely affect platelet function in diabetes. Supraphysiological concentrations of glucose inhibit the replication of cultured ECs from large vessels via different possible mechanisms but appear to stimulate pathways involved in the activation of capillary ECs. vWF is a possible marker of EC damage in diabetes, and prospective studies will ascertain its role as a predictor for the development of microangiopathy. The possible dichotomy in the response of cultured ECs from large and small vessels to high glucose in the culture media may help explain some of the lesions observed in the walls of arteries and capillaries in diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess whether children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have decreased catecholamine responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia as has been reported in adults and to explore the pathogenesis of the decreased response in terms of possible relationships to autonomic neuropathy or hyperinsulinism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A before-and-after trial on the effects of 3 days of intensive insulin therapy was conducted on 60 subjects with IDDM (age 15.4 +/- 2.6 yr, duration of diabetes 7.8 +/- 3.5 yr). The control group consisted of 5 children with non-growth hormone-deficient short stature (age 14.8 +/- 3.2 yr). Hypoglycemia was induced with an intravenous insulin bolus (0.15-0.75 U/kg) after insulin withdrawal and 3 days of intensive insulin therapy in diabetic subjects on an inpatient basis to assess the role of hyperinsulinism in suppressing the catecholamine response to hypoglycemia. Control subjects were studied once and received an insulin bolus of 0.1 microU/kg. Autonomic neuropathy was assessed by computerized assessment of the basal R-R variation during inspiration and expiration and the pancreatic polypeptide response to hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Basal plasma catecholamine levels were lower in diabetic subjects after intensive insulin therapy than in control subjects (P = 0.008). The peak and incremental catecholamine responses after insulin withdrawal and intensive insulin therapy in IDDM subjects were significantly decreased compared with control subjects (P less than 0.001). Peak catecholamine responses to hypoglycemia in IDDM were decreased after intensive insulin therapy (P = 0.002). This was particularly true in those with plasma glucose nadir levels of less than 2.2 mmol (P less than 0.001). The diminished catecholamine responses were primarily due to decreased peak epinephrine responses after intensive insulin therapy compared with insulin withdrawal (P = 0.011). There were no significant correlations between the catecholamine response to hypoglycemia and age, duration of diabetes, pancreatic polypeptide, or R-R interval. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that children and adolescents with IDDM after insulin withdrawal have diminished catecholamine response to hypoglycemia compared with control subjects and indicate that short-term intensive insulin therapy diminishes this response further. Thus, hyperinsulinism may play a role in suppressing the catecholamine response to hypoglycemia. There is no evidence for a clinical or subclinical role of autonomic neuropathy to explain the altered catecholamine responses.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of all episodes of bacteremia in hospitalized diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The study consisted of patients greater than or equal to 18 yr of age with bacteremia detected within a 19-mo interval. RESULTS: We compared 124 episodes of bacteremia in 119 diabetic patients to 508 episodes in 480 nondiabetic patients. Diabetic patients were older than nondiabetic patients (median age 74 vs. 68 yr, P = 0.0001). In patients with an indwelling urinary catheter and bacteremic urinary tract infection, the percentage of Klebsiella in diabetic patients was 60% (6 of 10) and in nondiabetic patients was 17% (4 of 23, P = 0.04). In patients without an obvious source of bacteremia, the percentage of staphylococcal isolates in diabetic patients was 29% (10 of 35) and in nondiabetic patients was 14% (24 of 176, P = 0.04). Staphylococci were a common cause of bacteremic infections of the extremities in diabetic patients (12 of 19, 63%) and nondiabetic patients (20 of 50, 40%). Septic shock was the only complication that was more common in diabetic patients. The mortality in diabetic and nondiabetic patients was 28 and 29%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent elderly patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this group, empirical treatment for suspected bacteremic urinary tract infection in patients with a urinary catheter should include coverage for Klebsiella. Empiric treatment for suspected bacteremia of unknown origin or caused by infection of the extremities should include an antistaphylococcal drug. The prognosis of bacteremia in diabetic and nondiabetic patients was similar.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen subjects with well-controlled NIDDM and normal lipid profile, 10 of whom continued oral hypoglycemic medication, participated in the study. A diet that emphasized low-GI foods (e.g., porridge, pasta) was compared with a high-GI diet (e.g., processed cereals, potatoes). The GI of the low-GI diet was 15% lower than the high-GI diet (77 +/- 3 vs. 91 +/- 1) but otherwise similar in macronutrient composition and fiber, as determined by a 4-day weighed record. The diets were instituted under instruction from a dietitian who visited subjects at home on a weekly basis. Body weight was maintained within 1-2 kg. RESULTS: Glycemic control was improved on the low-GI diet compared with the high-GI diet (statistically significant findings, P less than 0.05). Mean glycosylated hemoglobin at the end of the low-GI diet was 11% lower (7.0 +/- 0.3%) than at the end of the high-GI diet (7.9 +/- 0.5%), and the 8-h plasma glucose profile was lower (area under the curve above fasting 128 +/- 23 vs. 148 +/- 22 mmol.h-1.L-1, respectively). Mean fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol triglycerides, and lipoproteins did not show important differences. CONCLUSIONS: A low-GI diet gives a modest improvement in long-term glycemic control but not plasma lipids in normolipidemic well-controlled subjects with NIDDM.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined a population-based random cluster sample of 5080 adult subjects from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Glucose tolerance was assessed with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: Univariate data and multiple logistic regression models indicated that age, family history of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and physical inactivity conveyed similar risk for NIDDM (and IGT) in each ethnic group. After adjusting for all other factors, Hindu ethnicity conferred additional risk for NIDDM (but not IGT) in men, but in women there were no clear ethnic differences. Although BMI and WHR were independently significant risk factors, WHR conveyed relatively stronger risk for NIDDM than BMI in women, whereas the converse was true in men. For ethnic groups combined, the independent odds ratios for IGT associated with moderate and low physical activity scores (relative to high) were 1.56 and 1.71 (P less than 0.05), respectively, in men and 1.32 and 1.69 (P less than 0.05) in women. In subjects with asymptomatic NIDDM diagnosed during the survey, the independent odds ratios were 1.96 and 2.00 (P less than 0.05) in men and 1.73 and 2.70 (P less than 0.05) in women. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BMI, abdominally distributed fat, and physical inactivity are important independent risk factors for both IGT and NIDDM in diverse ethnic groups. Attributable risk fractions for Mauritius suggest that populationwide modification of levels of these risk factors could potentially result in substantially lower occurrence of NIDDM (and IGT). Such interventions should be attempted in high-risk populations.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six white and 16 black children with IDDM who volunteered to participate in this study were compared with 30 white and 42 black nondiabetic control children. RESULTS: Lp(a) protein levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in both groups of black children compared with whites (black vs. white nondiabetic children 6.8 +/- 0.95 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.68 mg/dl and black vs. white diabetic children 7.5 +/- 1.52 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.64 mg/dl). Lp(a) protein levels directly correlated with the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (r = 0.46, P less than 0.01) in white diabetic children but not in black diabetic children. Well-controlled white diabetic children (n = 12, glycosylated hemoglobin less than 10%) had a mean Lp(a) protein level of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mg/dl compared with poorly controlled white diabetic children (n = 10, glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 13%) whose mean Lp(a) protein level was 5.7 +/- 1.7 mg/dl (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that circulating levels of Lp(a) protein are increased in hyperglycemia. A genetically determined elevated level of Lp(a) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease in white and Asian adults. Elevated Lp(a) should be investigated as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease in IDDM. It could prove to be an additional mechanism for the development of diabetic complications in selected populations.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After appropriate dietary preparation, patients with a high risk for gestational diabetes underwent a 50-g oral glucose screening test during fasting. Patients were tested on enrollment and every 10 wk until delivery. Those with a 1-h plasma glucose value of greater than or equal to 7.5 mM underwent a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was based on either a markedly abnormal 50-g screening test or abnormal 100-g oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Ten of 15 (66%) patients who developed gestational diabetes were diagnosed during the first half of the pregnancy. Six were diagnosed in the first trimester. If the definition of an abnormal 1-h plasma glucose value was lowered from 7.5 to 7.2 mM, an additional 2 patients could have been identified in the first trimester with an improvement in sensitivity from 70 to 91% with only a slight drop in specificity (from 91 to 88%). Diagnosis of gestational diabetes was not enhanced by measuring plasma insulin concentrations or insulin-glucose molar ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of gestational diabetes in a high-risk population can be made in the first half of pregnancy. Early diagnosis should permit evaluation of intervention strategies, which may result in improved perinatal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical characteristics of diabetic end-stage renal disease patients that place individual transplant candidates at high risk for arterial morbidity and mortality after transplantation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the course of 101 sequential renal allograft recipients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplanted between 10 November 1980 and 1 April 1986. Arterial disorders were tabulated from medical records and interviews with individual patients, their families, and their private physicians. Documentation of discrete arterial events included recorded physical examinations, radiographic studies, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, peripheral vascular flow studies, and operative reports. The prevalence of preoperative arterial disease was compared with the occurrence of new arterial events after kidney transplantation. RESULTS: Within a mean follow-up period of 47 mo, a 30% absolute mortality rate was observed. Of these deaths, 57% resulted from arterial disorders. Clinical manifestations of arterial disease were recognized in 41% of recipients before transplantation, and 78% of these patients suffered new vascular events after transplantation. Of the entire sample, 57% developed at least one new complication of arterial disease after transplantation, whereas only 34% had no vascular diagnosis before or after transplantation. Cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial complications after transplantation occurred in 14, 28, and 36% of the patients, respectively. The corresponding incidences of stroke, myocardial infarction, and amputation were 12, 14, and 25%. Pretransplant coronary artery disease predisposed to new coronary events after transplantation, but only peripheral arterial complications occurred more often after transplantation compared with the preoperative period. The probability of arterial complications or death correlated with patient age at first transplant and duration of diabetes but not with sex or smoking history. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic arterial disease in diabetic renal allograft recipients contributes heavily to the long-term morbidity and mortality after transplantation and poses the major threat to survival. Diabetic transplant candidates greater than 35 yr of age or with clinical evidence of arterial disease should undergo an extensive vascular assessment, including stress thallium myocardial imaging and/or coronary arteriography. Such recipients should receive careful preoperative counseling about their excess risk for subsequent arterial disorders.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. There are few data available on the influence of metabolic control on plasma Lp(a) concentrations in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), a group at high risk for coronary heart disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the effects of improved metabolic control on plasma lipid and lipoproteins and Lp(a) concentrations in 12 subjects before and after 21 days of tight metabolic control. RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin declined from 8.4 to 6.9% (P less than 0.001), and Lp(a) declined from 29.7 to 27.1 mg/dl (P = 0.022). There were no significant differences in total, low-density lipoprotein, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although the decline in triglyceride concentrations were borderline statistically significant. The distribution of apolipoprotein(a) isoforms in IDDM patients was not unusual, and the apolipoprotein(a) isoform phenotypes did not change with improved metabolic control. Lp(a) concentrations were also significantly higher than in a population-based control group of nondiabetic subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of subjects was small and the degree of improvement in metabolic control was modest, the results suggest that improved metabolic control may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease mediated by Lp(a) in IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: In a randomized 5-yr multi-intervention trial, we tested the efficacy of intensified health education (IHE) in improving metabolic control and reducing the level of coronary risk factors and incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within the intervention group, the benefit of clofibric acid was evaluated in a double-blind study. One thousand one hundred thirty-nine newly diagnosed middle-aged (30- to 55-yr-old) patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) entered the study. They were classified as diet controlled after a 6-wk screening phase with conventional dietary treatment. During the follow-up, the control group (n = 378) was cared for at different diabetes outpatient clinics with a standardized surveillance. The intervention group (n = 761) had a structured IHE that included dietary advice, antismoking and antialcohol education, and ways to enhance physical activity. RESULTS: Randomly, 379 of the IHE patients received 1.6 g clofibric acid/day, and the others received placebo. IHE resulted in improved glucose control (adjusted fasting blood glucose) levels after 5 yr (control subjects 9.27 mM, IHE group 8.71 mM, and IHE plus clofibric acid group 8.60 mM, P less than 0.01). The better glycemic control was achieved with fewer antidiabetic drugs. After 5 yr, antidiabetic drugs were prescribed to 47% of the control subjects, 28% of the IHE group, and 34% of the IHE plus clofibric acid group (cutoff limit for drug application was postprandial blood glucose of greater than or equal to 13.87 mM). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0.26 vs. 0.40, P less than 0.01) and physical activity (174 vs. 327 scores, P less than 0.01) were increased, and blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol consumption were significantly reduced by IHE. However, IHE had no effect on calorie intake, percentage of fat in the diet (45%), and body weight. The most important finding was the significant increase of blood cholesterol in all three groups (+0.47, +0.36, and +0.34 mM, respectively). Clofibric acid only prevented the increase of triglyceride levels (+0.56, +0.24, and +0.05 mM, respectively). The incidence rate per 1000 for myocardial infarction was 30.3 for control subjects, 53.6 for the IHE group, and 55.6 for the IHE plus clofibric acid group. The corresponding rates for IHD incidence were 90.9, 97.8, and 98.8, respectively. Men suffered more frequently from myocardial infarction, whereas women developed ECG criteria for IHD more frequently. Among the 35 cases of death, besides cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis and neoplasia were the predominant causes. The death rate per 1000 in control subjects was 46.2, 30.6 in the IHE group, and 27 among patients with IHE plus clofibric acid. CONCLUSIONS: IHE was of substantial benefit for the control of glycemia, significantly diminished the need for antidiabetic drugs, and reduced a cluster of risk factors but had no effect on the control of blood lipids. This could be one major reason for the failure of IHE, effective lowering of blood pressure, and clofibric acid to prevent cardiovascular complications. Clofibric acid was only effective in reducing triglycerides.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-control study of 158 people with IDDM and 158 nondiabetic siblings matched for age and sex was conducted to evaluate the health, life, and automobile insurance characteristics and history of people with IDDM. RESULTS: Health insurance coverage (yes/no) among the IDDM and sibling control subjects was similar. More than 90% of the IDDM and control respondents had insurance through a private third-party source, and this insurance did not differ by type of plan, coverage, or premium. However, Medicare coverage was more common among the IDDM subjects and was associated with the presence of severe diabetic complications. IDDM subjects were also more likely to have been denied a health insurance policy by an insurer than were the control subjects (23 vs. 1%, P less than 0.001). Similarly, there was no difference between the IDDM and sibling control subjects in the number who had a life or automobile insurance policy. However, life and automobile insurance refusal was much more frequent among the IDDM respondents, more so for life (55 vs. 0%, P less than 0.001) than for automobile (12 vs. 4%, P less than 0.05) insurance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that access to insurance is severely compromised for people with IDDM. Although most of those with IDDM are able to find some form of insurance, it is evident that on average they must go to extra lengths to find it. These data and a changing insurance environment emphasize the need to reexamine, as a society, the importance of insurance for people with chronic disease, particularly IDDM.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with 1-wk treatment periods (2 x 15 mg/day d-fenfluramine) was conducted. Twenty obese subjects, 10 with normal oral glucose tolerance and 10 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), were all treated with a weight-maintaining diet. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps with measurement of glucose kinetics with D-[3-3H]glucose were performed at either two (patients without NIDDM, 0.05 and 0.10 U.kg-1.h-1) or three (patients with NIDDM, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.50 U.kg-1.h-1) insulin delivery rates. RESULTS: In the nondiabetic subjects, no significant changes in any metabolic or hormonal parameter were measured in the basal state or during the clamp despite a slight reduction in body weight (-1.2 +/- 0.5 kg, P less than 0.05). In the diabetic patients, no significant changes in body weight or basal plasma insulin levels were observed, but fasting blood glucose levels (8.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 1.1 mM, P less than 0.005) and plasma free fatty acid concentrations (1150 +/- 227 vs. 1640 +/- 184 microM, P less than 0.05) were significantly reduced after d-fenfluramine compared with placebo. During the clamp, insulin metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was similar after both placebo and d-fenfluramine; endogenous (hepatic) glucose production was similarly and almost completely suppressed, whereas glucose disposal was remarkably enhanced after d-fenfluramine (average increase of glucose MCR 35 +/- 12%, P less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Whatever the mechanism(s) involved, a 1-wk treatment with d-fenfluramine induces better blood glucose control and improves insulin sensitivity in obese patients with NIDDM independent of significant weight reduction; this last effect is not present in obese subjects with normal oral glucose tolerance.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In an effort to define this potential relationship, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were reviewed on all available kidney transplant candidates between 1983 and 1986. The patients were divided into two groups--those with kidney failure caused by IDDM (group 1) and those with kidney failure from other causes (group 2). A third group (control subjects) of volunteers with IDDM but without evidence of kidney failure was evaluated by PFTs in an attempt to determine whether IDDM without kidney failure was also associated with a decrease in TLC. RESULTS: Demographics of the two groups with kidney failure were similar. However, the duration of IDDM in the volunteers with IDDM was significantly shorter than in group 1 patients (19.6 vs. 25.9 yr). The TLC of group 1 patients was significantly smaller than the TLC of both the group 2 patients and the volunteers with IDDM. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these data suggest that the association between IDDM and decreased TLC is the result of IDDM and not kidney failure. Because our volunteers with IDDM were significantly younger than the patients with IDDM and kidney failure, we can draw no conclusions about any separate contribution of kidney failure to changes in TLC in people with IDDM.\r"

RESULTS: Improvement was noted at 6 mo for most self-care behaviors and glycemic control. At 12 mo, lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels were maintained (P less than 0.001) without increases in perceived hypoglycemia. Improvement was not maintained for those self-care behaviors that require change in life-style, i.e., diet and exercise. However, self-care behaviors that allow patients to self-regulate their glycemic control--self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin dose self-adjustment--were improved at 12 mo over preprogram levels (P less than 0.001). Frequency of insulin self-adjustment continued to increase during the period between follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that diabetes education is effective in promoting self-regulation behaviors, although it has less effect on traditional regimen behaviors such as diet and exercise.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study in a referral-based diabetes clinic on a sequential sample of 9 cigarette-smoking and 12 nonsmoking IDDM men with microvascular complications and 12 nonsmoking control men. CETP activity was determined in each serum with an isotope assay with exogenous cholesteryl ester-labeled LDL and HDL. The method is independent of the endogenous lipoprotein present in serum. RESULTS: The HDL-cholesterol (VLDL and LDL) ratio was lower in the smoking diabetic men than in the other groups (P less than 0.05 vs. the nonsmoking diabetic men and P less than 0.01 vs. the control subjects). CETP activity was 70% higher in the smoking diabetic men than in the control subjects (P less than 0.01) and 30% higher than in the nonsmoking diabetic men (P less than 0.05). The HDL-cholesterol (VLDL and LDL) ratio and the apolipoprotein A-I-B ratio were inversely correlated to CETP activity in the diabetic patients (r = -0.52, P less than 0.02 and r = -0.45, P less than 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CETP activity is increased in cigarette-smoking IDDM men with microvascular complications. High CETP activity may contribute to the unfavorable lipoprotein profile in these patients.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective follow-up examination of case subjects and control subjects with mean follow-up periods of 2.9 and 1.3 yr, respectively. The setting was the diabetes center at the Dusseldorf University hospital. Subjects were consecutive type I diabetic patients. Case subjects consisted of 44 patients with initial serum creatinine levels of greater than or equal to 133 microM and pathological proteinuria. Control subjects consisted of 46 patients with normal serum creatinine levels matched for age, duration of diabetes, and hypertension; 57% of case subjects and 67% of control subjects were being treated with beta-blockers. Incidence of severe hypoglycemia (cases/patient-yr) was assessed through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: At comparable levels of HbA1c (7.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.1%), case subjects had a fivefold higher incidence of severe hypoglycemic episodes (1.28 vs. 0.25 cases/patient-yr, P less than 0.02) than control subjects. Within the group with impaired kidney function, patients with severe hypoglycemic episodes had lower HbA1c levels (7.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 8.7 +/- 2.0%, P less than 0.03) and a lower body mass index (22.0 +/- 3.4 vs. 24.4 +/- 3.8 kg/m2, P less than 0.04) than those without severe hypoglycemic episodes, whereas serum creatinine levels, body weight-related insulin dosage (U x kg-1 x day-1), prevalence of blindness, autonomic neuropathy, and treatment with beta-blockers were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Type I diabetic patients with impaired kidney function are at an excessively high risk of severe hypoglycemia. In addition to low HbA1c levels, a low body mass index appears to be a risk indicator for this adverse effect of insulin therapy.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was comprised of seven NIDDM patients who visited an outpatient clinic and had a 24-h urinary protein excretion rate greater than or equal to 500 mg in the absence of heart failure, urinary tract infection, or other nephropathies. RESULTS: Glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-labeled EDTA, single-injection protocol) and 24-h proteinuria (turbidimetric method) were assessed at periodic intervals (2-6 mo). Correlation of the measurements with time (Pearson's r, with Student's t test used to assess the significance, alpha = 0.05) was used to evaluate the trend of evolution of glomerular filtration rate. Renal biopsies were performed in four patients. In three of four patients, renal histopathology was consistent with the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (in the 4th patient measurements were not satisfactory). Neither glomerular filtration rate nor proteinuria correlated significantly with time, except in one patient who had multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: The decline of glomerular filtration rate in proteinuric NIDDM patients is different from that observed in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, which is probably much slower.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, has been determined in a national survey of diabetes and glucose intolerance. Rates of elevated total cholesterol in people with diabetes in the United States are only slightly greater than in those without diabetes after adjusting for age and sex. Nevertheless, high or borderline high total cholesterol is common in diabetes and is present in 70% of adults with diagnosed diabetes and 77% with undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. population. Of these individuals, 95% have evidence of coronary heart disease or two or more risk factors for heart disease and should therefore have their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measured. Based on our national data, LDL cholesterol levels warranting dietary treatment for hypercholesterolemia would be expected in 85% of these people. Although elevated LDL cholesterol is uncommon in people with diabetes who have total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dl, other risk factors for coronary heart disease are very frequent (100% of men, 73% of women), and low total and LDL cholesterol may mask low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, investigation of blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk factors should be routine in all patients with diabetes, and treatment strategies should include management of lipid disorders and the multiple other risk factors for coronary heart disease that are highly prevalent in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the epidemiological evidence of the relationship between diabetes and periodontal disease, possible physiological mechanisms for the association, and effects of interventions on the occurrence and severity of periodontal disease among individuals with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive qualitative review of published literature in the area was performed. RESULTS: Much of the research in this area was found to contain methodological problems, such as failing to specify the type of diabetes, small sample sizes, and inadequate control of covariates such as age or duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Trends indicate that periodontal disease is more prevalent and more severe among individuals with diabetes. This trend may be modified by factors such as oral hygiene, duration of diabetes, age, and degree of metabolic control of diabetes. Generally, poor oral hygiene, a long history of diabetes, greater age, and poor metabolic control are associated with more severe periodontal disease. The association of diabetes and periodontal disease may be due to numerous physiological phenomena found in diabetes, such as impaired resistance, vascular changes, altered oral microflora, and abnormal collagen metabolism. With some modifications, the same prevention and treatment procedures for periodontal disease recommended for the general population are appropriate for those with diabetes. People with diabetes who appear to be particularly susceptible to periodontal disease include those who do not maintain good oral hygiene or good metabolic control of their diabetes, those with diabetes of long duration or with other complications of diabetes, and teenagers and pregnant women.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-six pediatric patients (aged 6.3-18.2 yr) with a duration of diabetes from 4 to 8.5 yr but free of clinical neuropathy were evaluated for abnormal nerve conduction. RESULTS: Mean HbA1 values for 1 and 2 yr before study were available. Electroneurographic findings were significantly different from control subjects in upper and lower extremities and included all five measured velocities, three sensory latencies, and one amplitude. Stepwise regression analysis identified an adverse effect of height on latency (5 of 6) and of mean HbA1 concentration on decreasing velocity (4 of 5). The data analysis from 52 patients who were restudied and who had a duration of diabetes from 5.3 to 9.6 yr confirmed that all velocity values slowed; one of five values did so significantly. The coefficients associated with mean HbA1 concentration usually increased in both upper- and lower-extremity velocity analyses at the follow-up examination. The change in peroneal motor velocity between the first and last examinations was significantly related to the increasing time interval between examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective evaluation of nerve conduction parameters in pediatric patients with diabetes should include both height (the most significant independent variable in latency analysis) and mean glycemic control (the most consistent variable in velocity analyses) as variables in the assessment of the natural history of evolving peripheral neuropathy.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the potential of this agent as an adjunct to insulin in the treatment of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve nonobese patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus were randomly selected from the outpatient diabetes clinic. The patients were made euglycemic with the Biostator, and postprandial hyperglycemia was determined under the following conditions: protocol 1, subcutaneous injection of insulin (13 +/- 1 U) given 60 min before the meal, with insulin dosages determined by the Biostator; protocols 2 and 3 same as protocol 1 but with insulin given at the time of meal ingestion; protocols 4 and 5 same as protocol 1 but with insulin given 30 min before the meal.

  ".W": "A useful paradigm for developing a public health strategy for combating chronic diseases consists of three phases: observational epidemiological studies, first cross-sectional and then prospective; intervention trials; and, finally, public health action. Although the field of cardiovascular epidemiology is well advanced into the third phase, i.e., public health action, the field of diabetes epidemiology is at least a generation behind and has only recently entered the phase of prospective observational studies. Part of the reason for this lag may be that, unlike cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes has not been traditionally viewed as an epidemic, thereby detracting from a sense of urgency about the disease. Although this perspective may be appropriate for white populations, data from around the world make it increasingly apparent that type II diabetes has indeed reached epidemic proportions in non-white populations. Prospective studies are needed to firmly establish risk factors on which public health actions can be confidently based. Although anthropometric and metabolic risk factors such as obesity, body fat distribution, and circulating glucose and insulin concentrations are becoming well established as risk factors for type II diabetes, much less is known about behavioral risk factors. These latter risk factors are especially important because they are often amenable to public health action. There are preliminary data suggesting that decreased physical activity and increased fat consumption may be behavioral risk factors for diabetes. Decreased total energy intake, reflecting either low levels of physical activity or an intrinsically low metabolic rate, perhaps genetic in origin, may also be a diabetes risk factor. Unlike the field of cardiovascular epidemiology, in which there is already a critical mass of intervention trials on primary prevention, such trials are essentially nonexistent in the field of diabetes epidemiology; they are urgently needed. Although the notion of a single gene causing diabetes is clearly simplistic, there is a reasonable expectation that genetic markers can be identified that would be useful in screening for genetic susceptibles, at least in selected predisposed populations. Such markers could then be used to identify target populations for primary-prevention trials and public health action. Although primary-prevention trials should not be deferred until genetic markers are available, these two research paths may someday converge and genetic markers may come to play an important role in screening individuals as part of a comprehensive public health strategy. Numerous trial designs should be considered for testing hypotheses about the primary prevention of type II diabetes. These include single risk factor, multiple risk factor, and factorial designs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

RESULTS: On renal biopsy, there was a marked increase in glomerular volume, glomerular basement width, and mesangial volume, findings similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This patient with marked insulin resistance associated with Donohue syndrome demonstrates renal and glomerular enlargement and morphometric glomerular changes similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In unusual syndromes with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, renal structural and functional changes typical of traditional diabetes mellitus may be seen.\r"

The American public has already made important changes in its health-related behavior. Millions of people have stopped smoking cigarettes, and many people have changed other behaviors to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Many of the changes required to improve the quality of diabetes care in the 1990s will involve significant changes in our society's health-care policies and its health-related values and behaviors. Such changes, although often difficult to bring about, have the potential to have a profound and lasting impact on the health of our society. Many patients with diabetes have already implemented new care practices such as self-monitoring of blood glucose and multiple insulin injection regimens. As better technology and more evidence for the efficacy of rigorous blood glucose control become available, they will also be translated into practice. Diabetes care can be improved but to do so significant scientific and societal resources will have to be brought to bear on the problem of understanding and influencing the health-related behavior of people with diabetes and the health-care professionals and institutions providing care for them.\r"

  ".W": "Although glomerular damage plays a well-established and important role in the pathomechanism of diabetic nephropathy, it alone does not fully explain the progression of renal complications in long-term diabetes mellitus. We discuss experimental evidence showing involvement of the postglomerular microvessels (peritubular capillaries and venules) in diabetic microangiopathy. This involvement is manifest in increased permeability of these vessels to plasma proteins and in highly augmented lymphatic drainage of the extravasated proteins from the renal interstitium. We suggest that in the advanced phase of diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria (corresponding to excess leakage of proteins through the glomerular capillary wall) indicates the probability that postglomerular microvessels have also allowed leakage of plasma proteins. As long as lymphatic drainage is capable of removing the increased quantity of extravasated plasma proteins from the interstitium, renal function should not be deleteriously affected. However, if the excess amount of extravasated proteins exceeds the capacity of lymphatic drainage, increases in interstitial volume and pressure are unavoidable with detrimental consequences for glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Under these conditions, a potential positive-feedback loop can be visualized that involves increased extravasation of plasma proteins leading to increased interstitial pressure that through dilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles results in a further increase in protein extravasation. These conditions combined with glomerular damage should lead to the eventual collapse of renal function.\r"

Plasma glucose concentration in the years before the occurrence of the disease was a major risk factor. Subjects with normal glucose tolerance but elevated fasting plasma glucose exhibited a similar risk of developing NIDDM as did subjects classified as having impaired glucose tolerance on the basis of 2-h postload glucose. In a multiple logistic regression, a high fasting plasma insulin concentration and a low 2-h plasma insulin concentration after a glucose load in association with a high body mass index were independent predictors of conversion to NIDDM from impaired glucose tolerance. Previously, this result had been found only in Nauruans, Pima Indians, and Japanese. This demonstrates for the first time in a white population that a high fasting and low 2-h insulin concentration is predictive of conversion to NIDDM from impaired glucose tolerance.\r"

Human fetal pancreatic cells, freshly digested with collagen, displayed a 17-fold response to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBLs) in mixed-lymphocyte culture. After 14 days in culture, monolayers derived from ICCs exhibited a smaller, twofold response to HPBLs. By comparison, in monolayers produced from single-cell suspensions, fibroblast overgrowth remained a problem. The endocrine component of the monolayers was 65 +/- 13 and 43 +/- 8%, respectively, with the number of beta-cells being 51 and 9%. Cells from both monolayers displayed increased insulin release when exposed to 10 mM theophylline, 10 mM Ca2+, and 0.6-1.3 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate but not to 20 mM glucose. Monolayers derived from ICCs synthesized DNA, proinsulin, and protein. This study showed that it is possible to establish an endocrine-rich monolayer of human fetal pancreas that has greatly reduced immunogenicity. The existence of residual activity to HPBLs suggests some additional form of immunosuppression is required to prevent rejection of this tissue when grafted into diabetic patients. Subculturing and cryopreservation may also be needed to achieve adequate numbers of beta-cells for clinical transplantation.\r"

CR2-expressing RINm5F cells secreted 78-33% less insulin than parental cells or cells transduced with an antisense vector and could be infected with high-titer EBV. We tested whether human CR2 expression on RINm5F cells would affect tumorigenesis after transplantation to syngeneic New England Deaconess Hospital rats. Non-CR2-expressing antisense-transduced RINm5F cells rapidly grew tumors and caused hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and the death of the animals after 15.7 +/- 0.7 days. CR2-expressing RINm5F cells were infiltrated by mononuclear cells at an early stage and eventually caused noninfiltrated tumors and the death of the animals after 33.0 +/- 0.4 days. These tumors were CR2- and are believed to have arisen from a minor CR2- population of tumor cells. The pancreatic islets were histologically normal at all time points. We conclude that expression of a xenoantigen on a rat insulinoma cell line induces an immune response in syngeneic rats but does not result in breakage of tolerance to parental or revertant cells.\r"

  ".W": "We studied both autophosphorylation and phosphotransferase activity of insulin receptors from abdominal skeletal muscles of nonobese subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Partially purified insulin receptors were labeled on their alpha-subunit with 125I-labeled insulin by chemical cross-linking and on their beta-subunit by autophosphorylation with 1000 microM ATP. Thereafter, phosphorylated insulin receptors were separated from total receptors with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Thus, the percentage of phosphorylated receptors in total receptors revealed the autophosphorylation activity. Using this method, we studied the function of insulin receptors from muscle obtained by biopsy during surgery in 10 nonobese NIDDM and 8' control subjects. In diabetic subjects, insulin binding capacity from abdominal skeletal muscles was 69.4% of the control subjects. Furthermore, the percentage of phosphorylated insulin receptors stimulated by 8.3 nM insulin was significantly lower than the control subjects (mean +/- SD, 29.0 +/- 12.0 vs. 56.0 +/- 7.4%, P less than 0.01), and there was a significant inverse correlation between fasting plasma glucose levels and the percentage of phosphorylated receptors among diabetic subjects (r = 0.73, P less than 0.025). Moreover, the insulin-stimulated kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide (Glu80Tyr20) was also impaired in diabetic subjects (28.5% of control). In summary, this is the first demonstration that the autophosphorylation step of insulin receptors from abdominal skeletal muscles is impaired in nonobese NIDDM subjects.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments were conducted to determine 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) in the thoracic aorta obtained from streptozocin-induced diabetic rats because 1,2-DAG is assumed to be a second messenger associated with phosphoinositide metabolism. After preincubation for a 25-min stabilization, 1,2-DAG content in isolated thoracic aortas 4 and 8 wk after streptozocin injection was significantly decreased by 42 and 31%, respectively, compared with age-matched control rats on 10-min norepinephrine stimulation (10(-5) M). However, 4 wk of daily insulin injection after 4 wk of untreated diabetes significantly shifted 1,2-DAG toward normal levels. Analysis of its fatty acid composition showed a significant difference between control and diabetic rat aortas at both 4 and 8 wk. In particular, the percentage of arachidonate, a precursor of eicosanoids, decreased. Such alteration in the fatty acid profile in diabetic rat aortas was inhibited by insulin treatment. 1,2-DAG content in the 8-wk diabetic group was also significantly decreased by 33% compared with control in the absence of norepinephrine, whereas 1,2-DAG content was lower than in the presence of norepinephrine in both the control and diabetic groups. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and phosphatidylcholine content in diabetic rat aortas was lower than control. Lower levels of 1,2-DAG in the thoracic aorta from diabetic rats were observed in the presence and absence of norepinephrine, suggesting that a defect in 1,2-DAG production may be associated with abnormalities of vascular smooth muscle responsiveness by agonists, as described previously.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of intestinal alpha-glucohydrolase activity is one approach for reducing the glycemic response from dietary carbohydrate and may prove useful for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In this article, we describe the pharmacological properties of a time-dependent intestinal alpha-glucohydrolase inhibitor, MDL 73945. When preincubated 2 h with a rat intestinal mucosa preparation before substrate addition, MDL 73945 was a potent inhibitor of sucrase, maltase, glucoamylase, and isomaltase activities (MDL 73945 concentrations required to cause a 50% decrease in enzyme activity, 2 x 10(-7), 1 x 10(-6), 5 x 10(-6), and 8 x 10(-6) M, respectively); without preincubation, it was 10- to 500-fold less potent. In rats, a single oral dose of MDL 73945 administered simultaneously with 2 g/kg body wt sucrose resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the area under the 0- to 3-h glycemic response curve, which was significant at 1 (45% reduction) and 3 (65% reduction) mg/kg. When administered 1 h before sucrose, the compound was more potent, with 0.3 mg/kg MDL 73945 significantly reducing the glycemic response to sucrose by 62%. A reduction in the glycemic response to sucrose was accompanied by reduced insulin secretion. MDL 73945 was slightly less effective against a starch load, with 3 and 10 mg/kg MDL 73945 administered 0.5 h before starch reducing the glycemic response by 39 and 52%, respectively. MDL 73945 was more effective against a sucrose load in streptozocin-administered rats than in control rats and was as effective after 16 daily doses as after a single dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) was examined in siblings of an unselected population (n = 194) of newly diagnosed diabetic individuals less than 30 yr old. From 1 July 1984 to 30 June 1987, diabetic subjects (proband) identified within a geographically defined area of southern Wisconsin were studied. IDDM occurred among siblings of probands in 13.5% of families and was associated with proband age at diagnosis. The highest risk was found for diabetic subjects less than 10 yr old at diagnosis (P = 0.04). We did not find an association between sibling IDDM and proband sex, HLA-DR3/4, duration of symptoms, or ketosis at diagnosis. In addition, the odds ratio (OR) for the association of IDDM in the proband with IDDM in parents and second- and third-degree family members was examined by case-control methodology. Diabetic subjects were matched to two types of control subjects (friends and general population) by age stratum and sex. The OR for IDDM was not increased significantly if parental IDDM or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was reported. However, there were very few parents with diabetes among diabetic or control subjects. In 6.4% of diabetic subjects, one parent had IDDM, 54% of whom were fathers. In 4.3% of diabetic subjects, one parent had NIDDM, and 57.1% of these were fathers. The OR for IDDM was significantly increased if second- and/or third-degree relatives had IDDM (OR diabetic subjects vs. general population 2.33 [P less than 0.05)] or NIDDM (OR diabetic subjects vs. friends 2.05 [P less than 0.01]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the release of IGF BPs by adult rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture. When cultured for 2 days in the absence of added insulin, hepatocytes released a BP identified as BP-1 on the basis of approximately 30,000-Mr on ligand blotting and reactivity with antiserum to human BP-1 in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies. Release of BP-1 was sensitive to insulin with suppression of 24 +/- 4, 73 +/- 5, and 64 +/- 14% at 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) M insulin, respectively; ED50 was approximately 1.7 x 10(-9) M, which is within the physiological range. Suppression by insulin was reversible and began within 3 h. Because normal hepatocytes in primary culture exhibit insulin-responsive release of both BP-1 and IGF-1, this system may be an ideal model for studies of molecular mechanisms of metabolic regulation.\r"

Six litters of fetuses of mean +/- SE gestational age 75 +/- 3 days were obtained from commercially available farm pigs. Pancreatic tissue was gently digested with collagenase, then a 10-day culture was performed. During culture, fetal proislets showed no insulin response to glucose alone but a significant response to glucose plus theophylline. The insulin content per microgram of DNA in the cultured proislets continuously increased. Histological examination by immunoperoxidase staining showed that, apart from single insulin- and glucagon-positive cells, there were no discrete islets in the pancreatic tissue and the cultured proislets. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin (STZ) in eight nude mice 3-4 wk after proislet transplantation and in another eight nude mice without transplantation. During the initial week, blood glucose levels of mice in both groups increased rapidly. The mean +/- SE peak value of blood glucose levels in the transplanted group was 20.4 +/- 2.0 mM and was 20.1 +/- 1.3 mM in the group without transplantation. Simultaneously, body weight decreased from 29.5 +/- 0.7 to 21.5 +/- 0.9 g and from 27.9 +/- 0.7 to 19 +/- 1 g in the groups, respectively. Afterward, blood glucose levels of mice in the transplanted group gradually decreased, and normoglycemia was achieved in all mice within 50 +/- 13 days after injection of STZ, i.e., 74 +/- 13 days after transplantation. The group without transplantation persistently maintained blood glucose levels greater than 16.7 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we report on sciatic nerve conjugated dienes, hydroperoxides, norepinephrine, and malondialdehyde in SDN at 1, 4, and 12 mo in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Severe hyperglycemia was present throughout in diabetic rats. Conjugated dienes were consistently increased at all time points, hydroperoxides were consistently reduced, and malondialdehyde was not significantly different in diabetes compared with controls. These findings are consistent with increased OFR activity in experimental diabetes. It is necessary to monitor several indices of OFR activity in a metabolically active tissue such as the peripheral nerve.\r"

Linogliride stimulated insulin release in the absence of glucose either in the presence or absence of a physiological mixture of amino acids. In addition, linogliride inhibited amino acid-induced glucagon release. Half-maximal effects of linogliride on insulin and glucagon release were achieved at concentrations as low as 26 and 3 microM, respectively. The effects of linogliride on hormone release largely resembled those of tolbutamide. In the absence of amino acids, the stimulation of insulin release by linogliride or tolbutamide was transient. When the pancreas had been preperfused for 20 min with tolbutamide, linogliride no longer had an effect on hormone release. Likewise, tolbutamide remained without effect in pancreases preperfused with linogliride. These data suggest that linogliride and tolbutamide may have a similar mechanism of action.\r"

In the perfused pancreas, pretreatment with tolbutamide desensitizes beta-cells to the action of linogliride. We tested the hypothesis that linogliride, like tolbutamide, affects the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, which are thought to control insulin release. We used the whole-cell voltage-clamping technique to measure the K+ current through ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane of single rat beta-cells, which were dialyzed with 30 microM ATP. Linogliride (10-300 microM) inhibited the K+ current; half-maximal inhibition was observed at 6-25 microM, depending on how much time was allowed for equilibration of the drug. Reversal of the inhibition was slow (t1/2 approximately 4 min). In summary, linogliride leads to a decrease in the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.\r"

Blood glucose levels were treated in 10 of the diabetic animals with daily subcutaneous insulin. After 8 wk, liver and kidney tissue was removed, purified membranes were prepared, and the percentage of glycosylated membrane protein was determined for the liver and kidney membranes by boronate-affinity methods. The percentage of glycosylated membrane protein for both liver and kidney tissue was found to correlate significantly with the glycemic state of the animal as assessed with glycosylated serum albumin, total glycosylated serum proteins, and glycosylated hemoglobin determinations (P less than 0.001 for each glycosylated protein parameter). In addition, the percentage of glycosylated membrane protein in the liver tissue correlated significantly with the measured level in the corresponding kidney tissue (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). To identify the nature of the glycosylated membrane proteins, boronate-affinity methods were used to separate the glycosylated and nonglycosylated membrane proteins. It was determined that two major glycosylated protein bands exist for the liver membrane (78,000 and 58,700 Mr) and four for the kidney membranes (ranging from 48,700 to 74,000 Mr). The ultrastructural location and identification of these glycosylated membrane proteins are not known. This study demonstrates that measurement of clinical glycemic state, as reflected in glycosylated blood protein parameters such as glycosylated serum albumin and glycosylated hemoglobin, correlates significantly with ongoing tissue membrane accumulation of glucose.\r"

After collagenase digestion of pancreases and elutriation of tissue fragments, islets were isolated and dissociated, and cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting. Approximately 30% of the initial beta-cell mass was lost during digestion and elimination of small mostly exocrine particles. Fifty percent was recovered in isolated islet preparations and 30% in the purified beta-cell suspensions of greater than 95% purity and viability. Sorting according to cellular flavin adenine dinucleotide content discriminated islet beta-cells from islet endocrine non-beta-cells, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and exocrine cells. Purified endocrine islet cell grafts were prepared by aggregating 10(6) pure beta-cells with or without 8 x 10(5) pure endocrine non-beta-cells. In contrast to intact islets, the purified aggregates were devoid of nonendocrine and damaged cells. Intraportal implantation of a pure beta-cell graft rapidly and permanently normalized the diabetic state of streptozocin-administered animals. The standardized preparation of purified beta-cell grafts allows us to address several metabolic and immunological questions concerning islet cell transplantation in diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines whether the survival of allografted rat islet beta-cells is influenced by the presence of other pancreatic donor cells. Grafts (RT1u/l) of different cellular composition were intraportally transplanted in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats (RT1n/n). All grafts corrected the diabetic state within 3 days. Implants of freshly isolated islets contained various endocrine and nonendocrine cell types; they became diffusely infiltrated within 1 wk and were completely destroyed within 2 wk. A 4-day culture period did not lead to major changes in the cellular composition of the islets or in their survival as allograft. Islet cell aggregates prepared after islet dissociation and cell purification were less acutely infiltrated and less rapidly rejected. Aggregates composed of sorted MHC class II-negative cells maintained basal normoglycemia in 3 of 5 recipients for 5 wk but only in 1 of 5 for 20 wk. Aggregates of purified islet beta-cells remained relatively free of diffuse infiltrations during the 1st wk and preserved the normalized state in 7 of 13 recipients for 5 wk; after 20 wk, 6 of 13 were still aglucosuric, but 40% of the implants were diffusely infiltrated and depleted of insulin. Reaggregation of purified islet beta-cells with purified islet endocrine non-beta-cells promoted their long-term survival as allograft: 11 of 13 recipients of mixed islet endocrine cells maintained normal basal glycemia over 20 wk; their implants contained relatively constant insulin reserves and remained virtually devoid of diffuse infiltrations. These results demonstrate that techniques aiming at the elimination of surface MHC class II-positive cells are less successful in preparing rat islet allografts of low immunogenicity than methods of positive cell selection. Pure islet beta-cells are immunogenic as an allograft but illicit a milder and less-acute immune attack than undissociated islet tissue. Nonendocrine and damaged islet cells are suspected of enhancing the rapidity and intensity of the cytotoxic reaction. Survival of allografted beta-cells is markedly prolonged by the presence of islet endocrine non-beta-cells within the graft. The mechanisms underlying this effect have not yet been elucidated; they may involve immune and metabolic interactions of the endocrine non-beta-cells. We conclude that purification of islet endocrine cells represents a new and powerful method for preparing insulin-producing allografts that can survive in hosts without pharmacological immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of cyclosporin on the survival of islet beta-cell allografts in streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. At a daily oral dose of 5 mg/kg, the agent prevented the rejection of isolated islets, provided they were little contaminated by other pancreatic tissue. The immunosuppressive effect rapidly disappeared after discontinuation of the drug, except when the donor tissue had been pretreated to reduce its nonendocrine content. All recipients of cultured and selected islets maintained a normalized state for greater than 15 wk beyond the 5-wk drug course; this was not the case for shorter periods of treatment. A long-term beneficial effect was also observed in all recipients of purified islet beta-cell grafts, which reversed without treatment in half of the cases. Cyclosporin markedly reduced the mononuclear cell infiltration in each type of islet beta-cell allograft; aggregates of mixed endocrine islet cells were kept virtually infiltration free. Conditions with minimal initial infiltration were associated with long-term graft survival without the need for continuous pharmacological immunosuppression. We conclude that a short-term cyclosporin treatment can induce long-term survival of allografted islet beta-cells, provided the grafts are only slightly contaminated by nonendocrine elements. In rodents, sufficient immunosuppression was achieved by circulating cyclosporin levels of 100-400 ng/ml. Higher concentrations were cytotoxic for cultured islet beta-cells and islet non-beta-cells. A 5-wk treatment with the immunomodulator ciamexone also resulted in long-term survival of purified beta-cell allografts but not of cultured islets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen patients were dilated twice with Rider-Moeller dilators and 14 were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10-20 mg 30 minutes before meals. A manometric evaluation was performed before and six months after starting treatment. The clinical evaluation (according to Vantrappen's criteria) was performed every three months for a mean follow up of 21 months. In both groups of patients a significant (p less than 0.001) fall in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was observed after treatment and excellent or good clinical results were observed in 75% of dilated patients and in 77% of patients treated with nifedipine. One patient could not tolerate nifedipine. No complications were observed after dilatation. It is concluded that longterm treatment with sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation are equally effective in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia of mild or moderate degree.\r"

  ".W": "In children technical limitations of upper oesophageal sphincter manometry have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In this study we have used an adapted sleeve manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined the influence of the state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17.5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual sleeve manometric assemblies which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67% of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0.0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18.1 (10.3) mmHg and highest in category D 55.7 (13.2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children.\r"

Each infant had a 'test feed' followed by an ultrasonographic scan of the pylorus at the cotside. On test feeding a palpable tumour was evident in 38 infants. On real time ultrasound using the criteria for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, these 38 infants as well as six others were documented as having pyloric stenosis. In the other 56 patients the vomiting settled in six and a barium examination was performed on the remaining 50. This confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux in 46, two of whom had an associated hiatus hernia, one with a duodenal malrotation, and three were reported as normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen is an accurate, reliable, and rapid screening method to differentiate the causes of severe vomiting in infancy.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the proximal and distal stomach in the emptying of solids and liquids from the stomach remains unclear. We have used a dual isotope technique to quantify proximal and distal stomach emptying of a solid (100 g of 99mTc labelled liver/ground beef) liquid (either 200 ml of normal saline (eight subjects) or 25% dextrose (seven subjects) labelled with 113mIn-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) mixed meal. A manometric catheter simultaneously measured antral, pyloric, and duodenal motor activity. The liquid component dispersed rapidly throughout the stomach and emptied after a minimal lag period. The emptying of the 25% dextrose was delayed compared with the saline. This delay was associated with increased retention of the liquid in the distal stomach, a significant increase in localised phasic pyloric contractions, and a suppression of antral contractions. The solid component initially resided wholly within a proximal stomach reservoir area. Solids then redistributed from proximal to distal stomach during the emptying of liquid from the stomach. Dextrose delayed gastric emptying of solids compared with saline by increasing the solid lag period and retention in the proximal stomach. There was no significant difference between saline and dextrose meals in the distal stomach retention of solid or in the linear rate of emptying after the lag period. We conclude that, contrary to general opinion, the proximal stomach plays an important role in the control of gastric emptying of solids while the distal stomach is important in the emptying of nutrient liquids.\r"

The sera were obtained at the time of symptomatic relapse and all patients had ulcers confirmed by endoscopy. A sensitive assay based on adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production in isolated porcine gastric mucosal cells was used as a measure. cAMP production increased up to four hours of incubation and was histamine responsive; an approximately 20-fold increase was found with histamine 10(-4) mol/l. Sera from both patients and healthy control subjects showed some inhibitory effect on basal cAMP production compared with incubation in medium only, whereas immunoglobulin preparations had a weaker non-specific effect. No stimulation was found when the patients' sera and immunoglobulins (up to a concentration of 6 mg/ml) were examined. These results suggest that gastric acid hypersecretion in duodenal ulcer disease is not an effect of histamine receptor stimulating antibodies. The data thus argue against a recent hypothesis that severe chronic ulcer disease in some patients has an autoimmune origin.\r"

In the course of chronic liver disease, however, these changes are not observed, despite higher portal pressures than those found in experimental studies. Eight patients without diarrhoea and with chronic alcoholic liver disease were examined for evidence of increased jejunal secretion; their suprahepatic wedge pressure was raised from 21 to 45 mmHg (mean 34.6 mmHg). Jejunal perfusion with a triple lumen catheter and a proximal occluding balloon was used to study net flows of water and chloride as well as net and unidirectional flows of sodium and potassium. No statistical difference in intestinal flows of water and electrolytes was noted between cirrhotic patients and control subjects after infusion with a 30 mmol/l glucose solution. Infusion with a 30 mmol/l mannitol solution resulted in a lower absorption of water, Na, K, and Cl than with the glucose solution. A higher rate of Na secretion was observed in cirrhotic patients than control subjects after infusion with 30 mmol/l mannitol (p less than 0.01). In addition, the rate of Na secretion was higher in cirrhotic patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between the net flow of Na and the suprahepatic wedge pressure. A second perfusion with a 30 mmol/l glucose solution was given 75 minutes after a bolus injection of spironolactone (400 mg). Net flows of Na and Cl were lower in cirrhotic patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.05) because of a lower absorption of Na. Patients with gradually developing portal hypertension have moderate jejunal secretions of H2O and electrolytes which we assume are partly masked by increased absorption resulting from hyperaldosteronism. In contrast to animal models, this mechanism may be part of the jejunal adaptation to permeability in acute portal hypertension.\r"

Membrane perturbation was assessed by measuring the net proton permeability (Pnet). Bile salts (deoxycholate, glycodeoxycholate, and taurodeoxycholate; 0.1-1.0 mmol/l) resulted in concentration dependent increases in Pnet: from (mean (SE] 5.42 (0.17) (n = 20) to 8.44 (0.24) x 10(-4) (n = 13) cm/s with 0.5 mmol/l deoxycholate.

When duodenal brush border membranes were preincubated with PGE2, 10(-7)-10(-6) mol/l, however, the bile salt induced increase in Pnet was significantly reduced: 7.22 (0.18) x 10(-4) (n = 13) cm/s with 10(-7) mol/l PGE2 and 0.5 mmol/l deoxycholate.

The role of arginine vasopressin in this circumstance and whether it is natriuretic, or antinatriuretic, is unclear. There is also controversy over its likely effect on small bowel fluid reabsorption. We have examined the effect of the non-pressor (V2) synthetic vasopressin analogue 1-deamino-8-D-arginine (desmopressin) on renal and ileal sodium and water excretion in ileostomy patients during acute adaptation to a low sodium diet. Patients were studied on two separate occasions (nonrandomised) with and without the administration of desmopressin (0.75 micrograms intramuscular, three times a day). In eight subjects without desmopressin there was pronounced diuresis on the first low sodium day, associated with a fall in renal sodium excretion and no change in ileal output or composition. In five (of the original) subjects with desmopressin there was pronounced antidiuresis, no change in renal sodium excretion, and no change in ileal output or composition. In both studies rises in plasma renin activity and salivary aldosterone concentration lagged behind the early decline in renal sodium excretion. We have confirmed the phenomenon of 'low sodium' diuresis after sodium restriction in ileostomy patients and shown that it can be prevented by desmopressin. Desmopressin has no direct or indirect effect on renal sodium excretion or ileal fluid and electrolyte loss in humans.\r"

Cyclosporine treatment of the recipient and irradiation of the donor were used to circumvent these phenomena in the WAG to brown Norway rat model. Irradiation of the donor with five or 10 Gy did prevent graft versus host disease but resulted in a more vigorous rejection of small bowel allografts in untreated recipients (mean (SEM) survival times of 11.5 (0.4) (n = 8) and 7.5 (0.9) (n = 11) days respectively, versus 16.6 (2.6) days (n = 17), p less than 0.01). Cyclosporine treatment of the recipient (25 mg/kg on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 after transplantation) led to a mean (SEM) survival time of 38.3 (8.5) days (n = 10); 20% of the animals developed graft versus host disease. Combined with 5 Gy donor pretreatment, a similar survival was obtained without occurrence of graft versus host disease. However, cyclosporine treatment combined with 10 Gy led to a significant shortening of graft survival (23.1 (6.8) days, n = 9). These results suggest that although irradiation is very effective in preventing graft versus host disease, high dosages may accelerate rejection either by making the graft more vulnerable to rejection or by completely removing the immuno-suppressive effect of graft versus host disease.\r"

  ".W": "Fluticasone propionate, a topically active corticosteroid of low systemic bioavailability after oral administration, has been used in a pilot study for the treatment of mild and moderately active Crohn's disease. Twelve patients received oral fluticasone propionate for three weeks, and the effects were monitored using the Crohn's disease activity index and by 111In granulocyte scanning, assessing inflammation from scan appearances, four day faecal excretion of radioactivity, and whole body excretion of radioactivity. All patients completed the trial. No serious side effects were reported. There was a significant fall in Crohn's disease activity index values over the three week treatment period (193 (84) v 122 (51), p less than 0.01). 111In leucocyte scan images were improved (seven patients) or unchanged (five patients). There was a significant fall in excretion of injected radioactivity calculated from whole body data (28 (21)% v 14 (0.7)%, p less than 0.05). There were no changes in plasma cortisol values, either basal or synacthen stimulated. Fluticasone propionate is a promising therapeutic agent for Crohn's disease that offers the possibility of controlling inflammation without inducing systemic corticosteroid side effects and which merits evaluation in a double blind trial versus conventional corticosteroids.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominal distension is a common but little understood symptom of the irritable bowel syndrome. The authenticity of the symptom was confirmed by appreciable increases in girth measurement during the day in 20 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome compared with 20 control subjects. Objective corroboration of this finding was shown in the group with the irritable bowel syndrome by a highly significant increase in lateral abdominal 'profile' on computed tomography. Previously postulated mechanisms for distension--namely, retention of gas, depression of the diaphragm, and excess lumbar lordosis--were excluded by the radiological findings. Voluntary protrusion of the abdomen produced a completely different pattern on computed tomography to that observed in the irritable bowel syndrome. These observations suggest that abdominal distension may be related to changes in motility or tone of gastrointestinal smooth muscle.\r"

  ".U": "91285556\r", 
  ".W": "Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study a series of 173 anal squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples from five centres around the world have been examined by DNA hybridisation for HPV type 16 DNA sequences. HPV type 16 DNA was found in 50 of 173 (29%) of these. The prevalence of HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly lower in tissue from India and South Africa than in the Swiss, Polish, or Brazilian samples. HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma does occur in other countries and further investigations of the prevalence of these tumours in association with other HPV types are required.\r"

Since little is known of the natural course of these tumours, we performed a clinical and sonographic follow up of 123 haemangioma patients. Our prospective study investigated clinical and sonographic findings in 158 haemangiomas for periods of 12 to 60 months. Ninety nine haemangiomas measured less than 2 cm and had an echogenic pattern; 40 were between 2 cm and 5 cm with a mainly echogenic structure; 19 measured greater than 5 cm and showed a mixed echo pattern. At the first examination only eight patients, all with giant haemangiomas, presented symptoms which could be attributed to the tumour. During follow up only one haemangioma changed in shape and size. One patient who was symptom free at the first examination experienced right upper abdominal quadrant pain during follow up. No deterioration occurred in any of the patients with symptoms at the first examination, and all had a satisfactory quality of life. No complications arose during the follow up period. This study shows that in adults haemangiomas remain stable in size and echo patterns rarely change. Only haemangiomas greater than 5 cm may cause symptoms. Prolonged clinical and sonographic follow up of small and medium sized haemangiomas is not warranted.\r"

After a 17 hour caffeine exclusion period, 300 mg of caffeine citrate was administered orally to the study subjects. Serum samples were taken four and 16 hours later. Serum caffeine concentrations were measured using an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and a clearance value derived. Conventional liver function tests were measured at the same time. A total of 103 subjects attending the medical unit in a district general hospital were studied. Twenty one had alcoholic liver disease, 11 non-alcoholic cirrhosis, nine non-cirrhotic liver disease, 21 suspected liver disease, six hepatic tumours, and 35 were hospital and normal control subjects. Caffeine clearance values were lowest in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (median 0.19 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-0.61 ml/min/kg) and significantly reduced in all subjects with liver disease (median 0.32 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-2.68 ml/min/kg) compared with control subjects (median 1.27 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001). In subjects with suspected liver disease subsequently shown to have another explanation for abnormal liver function test results, caffeine clearance values were normal (median 1.31 ml/min/kg, range 0.23-2.64 ml/min/kg) and significantly different, p less than 0.001, from those of subjects with liver disease. Serum albumen values were not different for these latter two groups. Using a cut off value of 0.86 ml/min/kg, caffeine clearance measurement was 100% sensitive for alcoholic liver disease and 89% sensitive for all liver disease. The respective sensitivities for conventional liver function test measurement were 76% and 83%. In the suspected liver disease group, caffeine clearance was abnormal in only 24%, conventional liver function tests were abnormal in 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Altogether 101 had cholangiocarcinoma, 21 gall bladder carcinoma, 20 local spread of pancreatic carcinoma, and 48 metastatic malignancy. Fifty eight patients had type I, 54 type II, and 78 type III proximal biliary strictures (Bismuth classification). All patients were either unfit or unsuitable for an attempt at curative surgical resection. A single endoprosthesis was placed initially, with a further stent being placed only if relief of cholestasis was insufficient or sepsis developed in undrained segments. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique was used to place the endoprosthesis when appropriate, after failed endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion or for second endoprosthesis placement. Full follow up was available in 97%.Thirteen patients were still alive at the time of review and all but one had been treated within the past six months. Initial endoprosthesis insertion succeeded technically at the first attempt in 127 patients, at the second in 30, and at a combined procedure in a further 13 (cumulative total success rate 89% - type I: 93%; type II: 94%; and type III: 84%). There was adequate biliary drainage after single endoprosthesis insertion in 152 of the 170 successful placements, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 80%. Three patients had a second stent placed by combined procedure because of insufficient drainage, giving an overall successful drainage rate of 82% (155 of 190). The final overall drainage success rates were type I: 91%; type II: 83%; and type III: 73%. The early complication rates were type I: 7%; type II: 14%; and type III: 31%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals have suggested a neural reflex between the gall bladder and the sphincter of Oddi. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sphincter of Oddi motility is altered by distension of the gall bladder in humans. Sphincter of Oddi motility was recorded intraoperatively in 10 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy for gall stones. The manometry was performed by a triple lumen constantly perfused catheter which was introduced through the cystic duct and positioned across the sphincter of Oddi to record sphincter basal pressure, wave amplitude, and frequency of contractions. In five patients a separate catheter was introduced into the gall bladder after ligation of the cystic duct. This catheter was used to distend the gall bladder. Sphincter of Oddi pressures were measured before, during, and after the distension. In a separate control group of patients (n = 5) basal sphincter of Oddi activity was recorded without distension of the gall bladder. Distension of the gall bladder decreased sphincter of Oddi basal pressure from (mean (SD] 22.8 (8.5) mmHg to 18.6 (6.5) mmHg (p = 0.01, paired t test) and frequency of sphincter of Oddi contractions decreased from 2.6 (1.6) to 1.1 (1.3) contractions/min (p = 0.003, paired t test). The results were significantly different from those of the control group (p less than 0.05, unpaired t test) during the same time period (four minutes). Pulse rate and blood pressure were not affected by the gall bladder distension. The results suggest a local reflex between the gall bladder and the sphincter of Oddi that might be important in the regulation of the pressure within the bile ducts and flow across the sphincter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r:0.93 to 1.00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0.90). Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor (0.55 to 0.70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes. The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes.\r"

With the HHR, for a mean anti-Xa (aXa) activity of around 0.40 IU/ml, no plasma activation of coagulation was observed; fibrinopeptide A (FPA) was in agreement with the residual blood volume (RBV) and the state of the bubble trap, especially with the PS membrane. With the LHR, for a mean aXa below 0.21 IU/ml, there was only moderate activation of coagulation. The PS membrane gave different results from the AN 69 membrane, RBV values on the HHR and aXa being lower on both the HHR and LHR, with FPA values being regularly lower on the LHR. The decrease in plasma beta-TG on the LHR was more marked with the PS than with the AN 69 membrane due to loss on dialysis or adsorption, as shown by the arterio-venous difference. The increase in plasma PF4 was related to the effect of heparin. However, there was no platelet activation. On the LHR, platelet count and intraplatelet beta-TG and PF4 levels remained very stable. The two high-flux membranes were very hemocompatible and require only low doses of heparin, but the dialyzer with AN 69 membrane need its geometry improving.\r"

Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, six with myasthenia gravis, and 6 with multiple sclerosis were studied. Serum Al, Zn, Cu, and Fe were measured before and after PP. Plasma was separated by first filtration; a second filtration separated the plasma components. Three liters of plasma were treated in each PP session. With each PP treatment, total protein (TP) removed was 20 +/- 5% and serum albumin removed was +/- 6%. Serum Al rose significantly (p less than 0.01 from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 2.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl post-PP. Serum Zn, Cu, and Fe decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 86.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl, 126 +/- 18 micrograms/dl, and 108 +/- 14 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 58.4 +/- 10.2 micrograms/dl, 104 +/- 6 micrograms/dl, and 82 +/- 16 micrograms/dl post-PP, respectively. Two days after the end of the six-month PP treatment, serum Al levels rose significantly (p less than 0.01), from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl. However, serum TP, serum albumin, and serum Zn, Cu, and Fe did not change significantly.

The extracorporeal treatment was initially performed weekly, and resulted in a sharp drop in total cholesterol from 1038 to 430 mg/dl. During the next four months the patient was treated every 10-15 days, and pre-apheresis cholesterol levels were maintained between 438 and 505 mg/dl, until an orthotopic liver transplantation was successfully performed. With semi-selective DF a mean 47.1% of total cholesterol was removed per procedure compared to 30.0% with DSC, although the volume of treated plasma was 38.0 vs 49.9 ml/kg body weight. The changes in plasma cholesterol levels during DSC and DF showed that the kinetics of cholesterol removal were similar with both techniques, but the efficacy differed; DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively lowered the LDL content. Cascade filtration may therefore be considered as a first-choice treatment for patients with LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis.\r"

We review some of these advances and discuss their implications on etiology, diagnosis, therapy and complications of some relatively common conditions. The etiologic agent of exanthum subitum (roseola infantum) has been clearly implicated as a herpesvirus-6. Although in the classically described situation high fever in a young child is followed by defervescence and rash, two new scenarios have been described associated with this virus. The first is fever without rash and the second is rash without fever. The etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum (\"slapped cheek\") has been shown to be a human parvovirus B19. The virus has also been associated with aplastic crises (in hemoglobinopathies), hydrops fetalis, and a syndrome of subacute arthralgias in women. The etiologic agent in cat-scratch disease has recently been shown to be a small pleomorphic bacillus that also can produce pyogenic granuloma-like lesions in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The number of cases of congenital syphilis, particularly in large cities, is increasing tremendously. Many of these infants have received no prenatal care because of drug abuse problems in their parents. Finally, we describe the changing etiology of impetigo that is predominantly associated with Staphylococcus aureus. We further describe the growing resistance to erythromycin and several new erythromycin drug-drug interactions.\r"

The cutaneous lesions that were present on admission in 64 patients (91%) appeared on the legs in 51 of the cases. V. vulnificus was isolated from the blood of 65 patients tested and from the skin lesions of 51 of 55 patients tested. The histopathologic findings differed according to the clinical stage of lesions.

The total irradiation ranged from 30 to 262 joules/cm2. All skin lesions, including therapy-resistant psoriasis vulgaris, seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis, and chronic urticaria, cleared during the first weeks of PUVA. A slight increase in the CD4 lymphocyte numbers was seen in two patients. Serum beta 2-microglobulin values and urine neopterin values remained steady, and the elevated serum immunoglobulin values became normal in all patients. The PUVA treatment did not induce appearance of HIV antigen in serum and HIV isolation was repeatedly negative in all patients whose cultures were initially negative. Lymphocyte recall responses to purified protein derivative (tuberculin) became positive in three and to HIV-specific antigens in two patients. These responses, however, were transient. All patients except one, who was positive for HIV antigen at entry, have remained well 1 year after PUVA therapy.\r"

To investigate this finding, we measured total testosterone, biologically active testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in 51 hirsute women with regular menses and compared the levels found to those found in 28 hirsute women with oligomenorrhea. There was no significant difference in the degree of facial hirsutism between the two groups. Oligomenorrheic women had significantly higher levels of free testosterone (p less than 0.02) and biologically active testosterone (p less than 0.05). The other androgens did not differ significantly between the two groups. The free fractions of testosterone are the metabolically active forms of the hormone and their levels are a function of the rates of production and clearance of testosterone that are elevated in states of hyperandrogenism. This study confirms that hirsute women with oligomenorrhea have higher levels of free and biologically active testosterone than those with regular menses.\r"

Isotretinoin 0.05% gel was applied to patients at a daily dose of 20 gm (equivalent to 10 mg of isotretinoin) over a 1900 cm2 surface area of skin on the face, back, and chest for 30 days. Blood samples were collected throughout the study and up to 48 hours after the last topical application; they were assayed for isotretinoin, tretinoin, and 4-oxo-isotretinoin by specific high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentrations of isotretinoin, tretinoin, and 4-oxo-isotretinoin were not measurable (less than 20 ng/ml) at any time. Most adverse experiences were cutaneous; a few systemic adverse experiences were judged to be remotely related to topical drug administration. The lack of measurable plasma concentrations of isotretinoin, tretinoin, or 4-oxo-isotretinoin and systemic adverse experiences indicates negligible systemic availability of retinoids even after multiple application of isotretinoin 0.05% gel at doses approximately 12 times greater than normal daily use.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction failed to detect varicella-zoster virus in a biopsy specimen. These results suggest that granulomatous vasculitis occurs without persistence of the viral genome and, perhaps, is a reaction to minute amounts of viral proteins.\r"

Complete clearing was seen in 26% with active drug and 1% with vehicle. Local side effects were primarily burning or stinging in 11% and 10% of patients treated on an active or a vehicle regimen, respectively. The morning cortisol levels of 168 patients were checked at baseline and again after 2 weeks of drug therapy. Subnormal morning plasma cortisol values were seen in 5% of the patients receiving active drug and in 5% receiving vehicle; 13% of those taking active drug versus 5% taking vehicle had a 50% or greater decrease in morning cortisol at the 2-week visit compared with baseline values.

A total of 25 patients with more than three lesions on each side of the face completed the study. All patients applied each agent twice daily for 16 weeks as a 0.05% cream to opposite sides of the face. The number of actinic keratoses in each treatment area was counted before treatment and at weekly intervals. The mean percent decrease in the number of actinic keratoses was 37.8% for areas treated with Ro 14-9706 and 30.3% for areas treated with tretinoin. Each of these decreases was significantly different from baseline (p less than 0.01), but not from each other. Ro 14-9706 was better tolerated; local inflammation was slight or absent in most patients, whereas tretinoin caused severe erythema in 50% and severe scaling in 23% of patients.\r"

Ten of 12 patients (83%) showed more than 50% lightening of their port-wine stains after 2.9 treatment sessions (2.9 +/- 1.4 [+/- standard deviation]). Forty-five percent of the patients demonstrated 75% or more lightening of their lesions after a mean of 3.8 treatments (+/- 1.6). No lesions in this group cleared completely after a mean of 2.8 treatments. Treated skin was identical in texture to normal skin in all patients. There was no evidence of depressed scars, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, or hypopigmentation in the treated areas. These results indicate that pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains can be undertaken safely in infancy.\r"

  ".W": "The length of survival and various risk factors were studied utilizing 408 residents (141 men, 267 women) of a large residential home. The subjects, aged 68 years or more at entry, admitted between 1978 and 1983, were physically independent, continent, and non-diabetic. They were followed until December 31, 1988, by which time 78% had died. The multivariate proportional hazard analysis showed the following entry variables to have the indicated effects on relative mortality rate ratios: 5-years' higher age (+10%, NS), persistent bacteriuria (+13%, NS), abnormal ECG (+26%, NS), current smoking (+63%, P less than 0.01), mildly impaired mobility (+96%, P less than 0.001), higher levels of in-study systolic pressure in 10-mm Hg steps (-4%, NS), higher entry serum cholesterol in 1-mmol/L steps (-7%, NS), and higher hematocrit in 5% steps (-14%, P less than 0.02). Female sex was associated with a +25% (NS) rate ratio; socioeconomic status and body weight were without effect. These data highlight the relative importance of specific factors associated with survival of persons within retirement homes and indicate that: (1) the presence of mild impairment of mobility at entry is by far the strongest predictor of early death; (2) smoking and lower hematocrit also exert important adverse effects; and (3) certain \"risk factors\", ie elevated systolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol, have a minimal protective effect, if any, in this age group.\r"

A randomized, non-blinded two-group experimental study was undertaken to determine if planned walking has the capacity to improve the communication performance of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Thirty subjects meeting NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, selected from two nursing homes, participated in the study. Intervention and comparison groups were each made up of subjects from both nursing homes. Subjects in one group were walked individually for 30 minutes three times a week for 10 weeks. Subjects in the comparison group were engaged in conversation for the same amount of time for 10 weeks. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed on the communication data. Analysis of the data at post-testing indicated that communication performance improved significantly in the planned walking group over the conversation-only group (f = 4.29; df = 2.28; P = 0.024). The results suggest that a planned walking program has the capacity to improve the communication performance of patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations. The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients. The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications. The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study. Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study. The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower. The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay.\r"

  ".W": "To increase understanding of the mechanisms causing syncope in patients over the age of 60, hemodynamic and hormonal responses to 60 minutes of 60 degree head-up tilt were examined in 10 patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin and five controls with no history of syncope. Nine of 10 patients and all five controls experienced orthostatic intolerance on the tilt table. Syncope or pre-syncope occurred later in controls than in those syncope patients who had exact reproduction of their clinical symptoms (median time 52 versus 22 minutes, P = 0.05). Three different mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance were identified in the 14 subjects: (1) vasovagal syncope, n = 9 (sudden hypotension +/- bradycardia); (2) dysautonomic syncope, n = 3 (immediate and gradual parallel declines in both systolic and diastolic pressures with blunted increase in heart rate); (3) psychogenic or vestibular reaction, n = 2 (orthostatic intolerance without hemodynamic changes). Vasovagal syncope patients showed a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine from baseline to maximum level during tilt (100 +/- 39% increase, P = 0.03) and a subsequent decrease at the time of syncope (30 +/- 5% decrease, P = 0.01), while plasma epinephrine increased markedly from baseline to the time of syncope (827 +/- 154% increase, P = 0.0003). Dysautonomic syncope patients had lower supine levels of norepinephrine compared to vasovagal syncope patients (182 +/- 30 versus 614 +/- 146 pg/mL, P = 0.008) and no significant change in norepinephrine over time; epinephrine levels increased significantly less than in vasovagal patients (net change 38 +/- 8 versus 189 +/- 56 pg/mL, P = 0.008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis, a metabolic bone disease most prevalent in older adults, is a major public health problem. Although management of osteoporosis through diet, exercise, and medication has improved, little is known about the psychosocial consequences of this disabling disease. In an attempt to identify patient characteristics that would provide physicians with insight into appropriate management styles for older osteoporotics, we assessed 103 patients with osteoporosis for their health locus of control (HLOC) orientation. We examined the relationship between HLOC and patient outcomes after participation in the Duke University Preventive and Therapeutic Program for Osteoporosis (DUPATPO) to determine whether HLOC was associated with functioning after program participation. More specifically, we asked whether internal or external HLOC was associated with decreases in depression, psychiatric symptoms, and stress symptoms, or with increases in self-esteem, exercise, and disease knowledge. We have shown in our earlier work (Gold et al, J Am Geriatr Soc 1989; 37:417) that program participation is associated with improved functioning in older adults. We now asked whether knowledge of a patient's HLOC would help predict these improvements. A comparison group (ie, older osteoporotics who did not participate in DUPATPO) was also assessed for HLOC to examine the possible association between HLOC and health behaviors regardless of the DUPATPO intervention. Our findings indicate that HLOC provided little useful information regarding patient outcomes. Although improvements were seen in the mental health of program participants, no association between these improvements and HLOC could be found.\r"

Four hundred-sixty records representing new admissions to five teaching nursing homes over a 1-year period were assessed for completion of items considered important parts of the admission assessment by geriatric experts. Univariate and multivariate analyses both suggest the following four findings. First, the admission assessments performed at teaching nursing homes reflect geriatric experts' priority areas with two exceptions: (1) the assessment of affective disorders and (2) the identification of advance directives. Second, physician-nurse practitioner teams perform the high priority parts of the admission assessment to a degree similar to that of physicians alone. Third, resident's age and expected length of stay partially determine the extent of the admission assessment, as patients with shorter lengths of stay generally received a more complete assessment. Fourth, even among teaching nursing homes, there are significant differences between nursing homes in the performance of comprehensive admission assessment by nursing home clinicians.\r"

DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used to study an historical cohort of newly evaluated hypertensive patients over a 2-year period. SETTING: Medicare HMO and FFS practice settings. PARTICIPANTS: Eight Medicare HMOs and 87 FFS primary care physicians in the same communities were selected. A sample of 685 elderly hypertensive patients was studied, 336 in FFS settings and 349 in HMOs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel of physicians selected standards of care for the management of geriatric hypertension, and medical records were reviewed. The results showed significant differences (P less than 0.01) in recording medications (94.5% HMO versus 88% FFS) and smoking histories (75.8% HMO versus 64.7% FFS), checking orthostatic blood pressures (9.5% HMO versus 3.3% FFS), performing funduscopy (44.4% HMO versus 27% FFS), completing cardiac examinations (90.8% HMO versus 79.8% FFS), and obtaining chest x-rays (72.8% HMO versus 64.3% FFS, P less than 0.05). Treatment and follow-up were similar between the two groups, except that FFS hypertensives were more likely to have medications adjusted and electrolytes ordered. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that elderly hypertensives in HMOs received equal or better quality of care for most criteria compared to elderly hypertensives in FFS settings.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in which all subjects completed both measures in a random order. SETTING: Durham VAMC General Medicine and Geriatrics Clinics. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 25 male veterans aged 65 and older (mean age = 73.5 years; 68% white; 68% currently married; mean annual income = $7,000). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two well-validated health status measures, the Sickness Impact Profile and the SF-36. RESULTS: The SF-36 took less time to administer than the Sickness Impact Profile in both the Geriatrics Clinic (mean: 15 vs 33 minutes) and General Medicine Clinic (mean: 14 vs 21 minutes). Although SIP scores consistently displayed a more optimistic picture of respondents' health compared with the SF-36, the two instruments were highly correlated: overall functioning (r = 0.73), physical functioning (r = 0.78), and social functioning (r = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: These two measures provide a similar ranking of elderly male veterans' health status. The significantly shorter administration time of the SF-36 is an attractive feature for both researchers and clinicians interested in assessing health status.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of five tests of hand function to discriminate the degree of dependency in older adults. Seven hundred sixty four subjects were assessed for hand function on performance-based (Williams Test of Hand Function, a test of Williams Board items only, Jebsen Test of Hand Function, grip strength), and self-reported (Dexterity Scale of the Geriatrics-Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (GERI-AIMS] measures of hand function, and self-reported multidimensional functional status (GERI-AIMS). A trichotomous variable representing a continuum of dependency based upon living site (independent living, home-bound, institutional) was used as the measure of dependency. Sixty-two cases were dropped for incomplete data. Discriminant function analyses of the 702 subjects (age X = 76.78 years, SD = 8.79) showed that basic demographic variables explain 40.8% of the variance in dependency; all hand function tests significantly correlated with dependency; the Williams Board correlated best (additional 12.5% variance explained). However, a multidimensional functional status measure explains substantially more variance in dependency (16.9%) after controlling for demographic variables and performance on the Williams Board. This comparison of methods and tests available for measuring hand function was made to provide criteria for selecting an instrument for a given setting.\r"

This study was undertaken to define the incidence of adverse reactions to amantadine in the elderly and to identify risk factors for side effects. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A retirement home which offered amantadine prophylaxis to its residents during a presumed influenza outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 96 elderly residents, 79 accepted the offer of amantadine prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attributable adverse health outcomes as assessed by chart review. RESULTS: 41% of the people receiving amantadine had attributable adverse reactions, of which 22% were classified as severe. Severe adverse reactions were associated with residence in the assisted living section of the facility (P = 0.002), a greater number of underlying diagnoses (P = 0.009), congestive heart failure (P = 0.02), and high serum creatinine (P = 0.02). A person with none of these risk factors had a 7% chance of having a severe adverse outcome compared to a 70% chance for someone with all four risk factors. CONCLUSION: The findings raise concern that the prophylactic administration of amantadine to all elderly residents of nursing and retirement homes may be associated with a high incidence of unacceptable reactions, particularly among less healthy residents.\r"

Of patients treated with dopaminergic agents, 30% develop visual hallucinations, 10% exhibit delusions, 10% have euphoria, 1% have mania, 10% to 15% experience increased anxiety, 15% have confusional periods, and a few exhibit altered sexual behavior. Anticholinergic drugs have a greater tendency to produce confusional states than dopaminergic compounds. Elderly patients and those with underlying dementia are most likely to have untoward side effects with anti-parkinsonism treatment. Dosage reduction is the optimum management strategy, although anti-psychotic agents may be necessary in patients with delusions, and lithium may help control drug-induced mania. Dopaminergic agents share the property of stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors, and this action may play an essential role in mediating their neuropsychiatric effects.\r"
