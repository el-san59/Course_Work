  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the aerobic work capacity of patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome and compare it with that of two control groups, and to assess the patients' perception of their level of activity before and during illness. DESIGN--A symptom limited exercise treadmill test with on line gas analysis and blood sampling was used. Subjects were assessed by one investigator, who was blind to the group which they were in. SETTING--Department of medicine, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. SUBJECTS--13 Patients (10 women, three men) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Two control groups of similar age, sex, and body weight: 13 normal subjects (10 women, three men) and seven patients (five women, two men) with the irritable bowel syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Aerobic work capacity as assessed by several variables such as length of time on treadmill, heart rate, and biochemical measurements; Borg score; and visual analogue scores of perceived level of physical activity. RESULTS--The patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome had a reduced exercise capacity compared with that of the other subjects, spending a significantly shorter time on the treadmill. They had a significantly higher heart rate at submaximal levels of exertion and at stage III exertion had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations. Using a Borg score, they showed a significantly altered perception of their degree of physical exertion with a mean score of 8.2 compared with 6.6 and 5.3 for the normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome respectively. Using a visual analogue scale they indicated that they had a greater capacity for activity before illness than had the patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, but the scores were not significantly different between the two groups. Both groups of patients indicated reduced activity at the time of testing. Normal controls and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome aspired to a greater level of activity than their current level, but the patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome aspired to a level similar to that which they had had before their illness. CONCLUSIONS--Patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have reduced aerobic work capacity compared with normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. They also have an altered perception of their degree of exertion and their premorbid level of physical activity.\r"

DESIGN--Five year longitudinal clinical and laboratory study. SETTING--Regional haemophilia centre, university virology laboratory, and Medical Research Council laboratory. PATIENTS--32 Patients with haemophilia A exposed to a single batch of HIV contaminated factor VIII concentrate from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service in 1984 who were followed up regularly in Edinburgh (31) or abroad (one). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Counts of circulating T cell subsets (CD4 and CD8); plasma beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, and IgA concentrations; and delayed type hypersensitivity to multiple skin test antigens. RESULTS--18 Patients who seroconverted after exposure had received significantly more contaminated factor VIII than the 14 who did not (mean 43 (range 9-109) v 15 (3-30) phials, p less than 0.01). The two groups were not distinguishable by other criteria before exposure. The group that seroconverted subsequently showed a progressive fall in mean circulating CD4 lymphocytes and an increase in plasma beta 2 microglobulin and neopterin concentrations. From 1987 patients in this group also showed an increase in mean circulating CD8 lymphocytes and in plasma IgA concentration, neither of which was seen in patients who did not seroconvert. Patients with HIV antibody who developed Centers for Disease Control category IV symptoms within five years after infection showed more extreme changes in all measures, except CD8 lymphocyte count, than those whose symptoms remained in categories II and III. Skin test reactivity declined to barely detectable levels in all patients positive for HIV antibody. CONCLUSIONS--Serial estimates of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and of plasma beta 2 microglobulin concentration are the most reliable measures of disease progression; of these, beta 2 microglobulin concentration seems to be the better predictor of impending serious symptoms. High IgA concentrations reflect rather than predict disease state. Individual variation in most measures is such that a wide range of measurements should be used in assessing the effects of trial treatment in HIV infected patients without symptoms.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire follow up survey. PARTICIPANTS--1572 Doctors who graduated from five British medical schools in 1981, 1983, and 1985, including 587 women and 131 doctors from ethnic minorities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Reported success rates of applications for training posts. RESULTS--Comparison of the career patterns of women and men yielded no evidence of discrimination against women in competition for posts. In contrast, there were striking differences in career patterns between graduates of native European origin and those of ethnic minority origin. Graduates from ethnic minorities reported lower success rates and more difficulty in obtaining house officer posts, registrar posts, and places in vocational training schemes in general practice. Most of this discrimination seemed to occur at the stage of shortlisting for interview. Graduates from ethnic minorities were more likely than graduates of native European origin to have experienced spells of unemployment while seeking work. They were also more likely to have changed their original choice of career because of difficulty in obtaining suitable training posts or unfavourable career prospects. CONCLUSIONS--Discrimination against ethnic minorities occurs in the competition for training posts among graduates from British medical schools. There was no evidence of discrimination against women graduates. Shortlisting procedures based on objective scoring systems may help to ensure equality of opportunity in future.\r"

SETTING--The Liver Unit, King's College Hospital, London. PATIENTS--150 Consecutive patients with paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure admitted between October 1986 and February 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death. RESULTS--Of the 150 patients, 72 (48%) died. In all, 34 of the 37 (92%) patients with a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds died as did 20 of the 41 (49%) with a time of 130-179 seconds, nine of the 25 (36%) with a time of 90-129 seconds, and nine of the 47 (19%) with a time of less than 90 seconds. Of the 42 patients with a continuing rise in prothrombin time between days 3 and 4 after overdose, 39 died (93%) compared with 21 of the 96 (22%) in whom the prothrombin time fell. CONCLUSIONS--These data indicate that a continued increase in prothrombin time on day 4 after overdose and a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds identify at an early stage those patients with a less than 8% chance of survival. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients meeting either of these criteria.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Responses to self administered questionnaire asking about lifetime exposure to dust, animals, and smoke at home and at work. RESULTS--The patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were more likely to report occupational exposure to metal dust (matched odds ratio 10.97 (95% confidence interval 2.30 to 52.4), p less than 0.001) or wood dust (2.94 (0.87 to 9.90), p = 0.08), to have worked with cattle (10.89 (1.24 to 96.0), p = 0.01), and to have lived in a house heated by a wood fire (12.55 (1.04 to 114), p = 0.009). A history of smoking and social class based on occupation were not significantly related to disease state. CONCLUSION--Environmental exposure to dust may be an important factor in the aetiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.\r"

DESIGN--A retrospective examination of mortality ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in England and Wales between 1979 and 1988 with analysis, by multiple logistic regression, of independent effects of age, sex, region of residence, and social class as indicated by occupation on data for 1979-87; also a retrospective review of hospital records of patients certified as having died of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in Nottingham and of the certified cause of death of patients known to have had the disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Time trends in mortality nationally; effects on mortality of age, sex, and region of residence; validity of death certification in Nottingham. RESULTS--The annual number of deaths ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis doubled from 336 in 1979 to 702 in 1988, the increase occurring mainly at ages over 65. Mortality standardised for age for both sexes likewise increased steadily over the period. Deaths due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were commoner in men (odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 2.11 to 2.33) and increased substantially with age, being 7.84 (7.24 to 8.49) times higher in subjects aged much greater than 75 than those aged 45-64. Odds ratios of death due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis adjusted for age and sex were increased in the traditionally industrialised central areas of England and Wales (p less than 0.02, maximum odds ratio between regions 1.25), but no significant increase in odds of death was found for manual occupations. Of 23 people whose deaths were registered in Nottingham as having been due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, 19 were ascertained from clinical records to have had the disease. Only 17 of 45 patients known to have had cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in life were recorded as having died from the disease. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic accuracy of death certification of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis is high, but the number of deaths recorded as being due to the disease may underestimate the number of patients dying with the disease by up to half. Mortality due to the disease is increasing, and the male predominance and regional differences in mortality suggest that environmental factors are important in its aetiology.\r"

DESIGN--All patients from a single electoral ward who were either admitted to hospital or treated at home over a two year period (1 October 1987 to 30 September 1989) were included in the study and their case notes audited. The second year of the study is reported. SETTING--Electoral ward of Sparkbrook, Birmingham. SUBJECTS--99 Patients aged 16-65 with severe acute psychiatric illness. RESULTS--65 Patients were managed by home treatment alone; 34 required admission to hospital. The location of treatment was significantly (all p less than 0.05) influenced by social characteristics of the patients (marital state, age (in men), ethnicity, and living alone) and by characteristics of the referral (occurring out of hours; assessment taking place at hospital or police station). DSM-III-R diagnosis was more weakly associated with outcome. Violence during the episode was significantly related to admission, although deliberate self harm was not. CONCLUSIONS--Home treatment is feasible for most patients with acute psychiatric illness. A 24 hour on call assessment service increases the likelihood of success because admission is determined more strongly by social characteristics of the patient and the referral than by illness factors. Admission will still be required for some patients. A locally based mental health resource centre, a 24 hour on call service, an open referral system, and an active follow up policy increase the effectiveness of a home treatment service.\r"

DESIGN--Case-control study of blood samples collected at nine to 27 weeks of pregnancy. SETTING--Antenatal clinics in London and Oxford. PATIENTS--72 Women whose fetuses had been diagnosed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling as having Down's syndrome and 156 women whose fetuses did not have the syndrome. Only singleton pregnancies were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Activity of urea resistant neutrophil alkaline phosphatase measured cytochemically. RESULTS--The median enzyme activity in the index patients was 1.65 times the expected median for the controls at the same duration of pregnancy (p less than 0.0001; 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 1.74). A cut off value that identified the 5% of control patients with the highest activities yielded a rate of detection of Down's syndrome of 79% (95% confidence interval 70 to 89%). CONCLUSION--Activity of urea resistant neutrophil alkaline phosphatase is an effective maternal blood marker for Down's syndrome. Its use in antenatal screening could lead to a substantial improvement in the detection of this disorder. Before introducing the test into routine medical practice it will have to be automated so that it can be used on a large scale and is less subjective.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of the records of all eligible patients attending the surgery at randomly selected sessions. SETTING--Four large group practices in the Southampton Health District, one of which operated a strict system of personal lists. PATIENTS--776 Patients who had been registered for at least two years and had consulted at least 12 times over six years or less. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Continuity score for each patient calculated from the number of consultations (out of the past 12) with his or her usual doctor. Number of the times the patients had consulted the doctor with whom they were registered. RESULTS--In the practice with personal lists a mean of 10 of the 12 consultations had been with the same doctor (83% of consultations), but in the three practices with combined lists the means were 5.9 (49%), 6.2 (52%), and 6.9 (58%). Continuity was associated with increased age and with the recording of a major problem. In the practices with combined lists 63 of 72 children consulted at least five different doctors. Only 140 of 489 patients currently in the practice who were identified as being registered with a doctor had most usually consulted that doctor in the practices with combined lists. CONCLUSIONS--Personal continuity of care may be fairly low in group practice, especially for younger and healthier patients registered at practices with combined lists. These findings support the Department of Health's recent decision to make \"target payments\" (for cervical smears and childhood immunisations) to groups rather than to individual principals but pose a question for the future of individual clinical responsibility.\r"

SETTING AND SUBJECTS--Samples of adults representing 52 populations in 32 countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The relations, expressed as correlation coefficients, between the mean population values for blood pressure, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake and the prevalence of, respectively, hypertension (greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2), high alcohol intake (greater than or equal to 300 ml/week), and high sodium intake (greater than or equal to 250 mmol/day). RESULTS--There were close and independent associations between the population mean and the prevalence of deviance for each of the variables examined: correlation coefficients were 0.85 for blood pressure, 0.94 for body mass index, 0.97 for alcohol intake, and 0.78 for sodium intake. CONCLUSIONS--These findings imply that distributions of health related characteristics move up and down as a whole: the frequency of \"cases\" can be understood only in the context of a population's characteristics. The population thus carries a collective responsibility for its own health and well being, including that of its deviants.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To test the hypothesis that opiate addiction in adults might stem partly from an imprinting process during birth when certain drugs are given to the mother. DESIGN--Retrospective study by logistic regression of opiate addicts with siblings as controls. SETTING--Stockholm, Sweden. SUBJECTS--200 Opiate addicts born in Stockholm during 1945-66, comprising 41 identified during interviews of probands for an earlier study; 75 patients whose death from opiate addiction had been confirmed during 1978-88; and 84 accepted for the methadone programme. 262 Siblings (controls) born in Stockholm during the same period, 24 of whom were excluded for drug addiction or being brought up outside the family. Birth records were unavailable for eight, leaving 230 siblings and 139 corresponding probands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Administration of opiates, barbiturates, and nitrous oxide (for greater than 1 h) to mothers of all subjects during labour within 10 hours before birth as a risk factor for adult opiate addiction. RESULTS--In subjects who had subsequently become addicts a significant proportion of mothers had received opiates or barbiturates, or both, compared with unmatched siblings (25% v 16%, chi 2 = 5.83, df = 1, p = 0.02), and these mothers had received nitrous oxide for longer and more often. After controlling for hospital of birth, order of birth, duration of labour, presentation other than vertex, surgical intervention, asphyxia, meconium stained amniotic fluid, and birth weight the relative risk for offspring subsequently becoming an adult opiate addict increased with the number of administrations of any of the three drugs. When the addicts were matched with their own siblings the estimated relative risk was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 12.4, p for trend = 0.002) for three administrations compared with when no drug was given. CONCLUSIONS--The results are compatible with the imprinting hypothesis. Therefore, for obstetric pain relief methods are preferable that do not permit substantial passage of drugs through the placenta.\r"

DESIGN--An analysis of diabetic control in early pregnancy including a record of severe hypoglycaemic episodes in relation to the occurrence of major congenital malformation among the infants. SETTING--A diabetic clinic and a combined diabetic and antenatal clinic of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--143 Insulin dependent women attending a prepregnancy clinic and 96 insulin dependent women managed over the same period who had not received specific prepregnancy care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The incidence of major congenital malformation. RESULTS--Compared with the women who were not given specific prepregnancy care the group who attended the prepregnancy clinic had a lower haemoglobin AI concentration in the first trimester (8.4% v 10.5%), a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia in early pregnancy (38/143 women v 8/96), and fewer infants with congenital abnormalities (2/143 v 10/96; relative risk among women not given specific prepregnancy care 7.4 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 33.2]. CONCLUSION--Tight control of the maternal blood glucose concentration in the early weeks of pregnancy can be achieved by the prepregnancy clinic approach and is associated with a highly significant reduction in the risk of serious congenital abnormalities in the offspring. Hypoglycaemic episodes do not seem to lead to fetal malformation even when they occur during the period of organogenesis.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study entailing the examination of all patients with both investigations concurrently. The investigations were performed independently on routine lists by different duty radiologists. Each was aware of the details of the request form but not of the findings of the other investigation. SETTING--Radiology department of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--155 Consecutive adult patients (aged 18-93) referred from general practitioners and hospital outpatient clinics with a history of haematuria. FOLLOW UP--When results of both examinations proved normal no clinical or radiological follow up was sought. All abnormal findings of either investigation were correlated with results of subsequent imaging studies or operative findings. RESULTS--81 Patients (52%) had normal findings on urography and ultrasonography. Overall, the findings of ultrasonography concurred with those of urography in 144 cases (93%). Among the discrepant findings of the two investigations ultrasonography missed two ureteric calculi; one was in a non-dilated ureter, and in the other case ultrasonography detected the secondary ureteric dilatation. Ultrasound examination alone detected four bladder tumours not visible on urography with sizes ranging from 5 to 21 mm, representing one fifth of the 20 cystoscopically proved bladder tumours detected in the series. Ultrasonography detected all the 22 neoplastic lesions discovered in the study (20 bladder, two renal). Ultrasonography clarified the nature of renal masses evident in three urograms (simple cysts). CONCLUSIONS--Ultrasonography is a safe and accurate method of investigating the urinary tract in adults with haematuria. When combined with a single plain abdominal radiograph it proved to be superior to urography as the primary imaging study in this series. Ultrasonography should certainly be preferred to urography if cystoscopy is not planned. No urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract were found in the series, reflecting their rarity. For those patients in whom ultrasonography and plain radiography have shown no abnormality and in whom cystoscopic appearances are normal urography would be advisable to exclude urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract.\r"

PATIENTS--2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS--17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease.\r"

RESULTS--16 of 17 school nurses responded (37 of 41 schools). Fifteen schools did not have the minimum number of toilets and hand basins established in the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1981. In two schools toilets were kept locked for most of the day. In 10 schools toilet paper was not always available, and three of five secondary schools did not have disposal units for sanitary towels in the girls' toilet areas. In 18 of the schools the toilets were not kept adequately clean. CONCLUSIONS--These conditions raise serious questions about environmental health, with the potential for the spread of infectious diseases, and undermine attempts to teach children basic hygiene. Health professionals have an important role in assessing health and safety standards in schools and ensuring that necessary improvements are made.\r"

  ".W": "A single (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneal dose of 2-bromoethanamine hydrobromide induced renal papillary necrosis (RPN) acutely in rodents and caused a transient crystalluria between 4 and 8 h after dosing. These crystals comprised struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) as assessed by shape, solubility, infra-red spectrum and X-ray microprobe analysis. Acid-soluble, bi-refringent crystals were also present within the renal medullary matrix during the same time period as the crystalluria. The presence of the MAP was associated with loss of the anionic renal medullary mucopolysaccharides staining. A total of 5/64 rats with a 2-bromoethanamine-induced renal papillary necrosis and monitored for up to 160 days had bladder calculi that were predominantly MAP. These data suggest that medullary mucopolysaccharide matrix disruption associated with RPN leads to a release of previously bound cations, super-saturation and the nucleation of crystalline MAP. These processes could also be implicated in the formation of MAP bladder calculi.\r"

The most common benign cause is retroperitoneal fibrosis and the most frequent malignant causes are extension from an adjacent primary tumour, true metastases to the ureter and lymphoma. Lack of recognition of the process may lead to mistaken diagnosis of an inflammatory stricture or infiltrating transitional cell tumour, with resultant inappropriate management. A sign which appears to be almost specific for encasement, the bullet and bodkin configuration, is described here. Newer imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasound, while helpful, are probably less sensitive and less specific than the retrograde ureterogram because a detectable mass is not always present.\r"

Drugs were successful in reducing micturition problems in 3/6 patients. Severely retarded patients with spastic quadriplegia are difficult to investigate and if this is associated with detrusor hyper-reflexia it is impossible to treat them in any way. Severely retarded patients with detrusor areflexia and infrequent voiding can benefit from bladder outlet surgery. Patients with moderate (especially mild) retardation can be investigated and treated in the same way as non-retarded people.\r"

It was found that 11% of patients had nocturnal enuresis beyond age 8 and 25% had irritable bowel syndrome: their response to treatment was generally poor. Life events were not consistently related to treatment response. The mean psychoneurotic score of \"poor responders\" (43.7) was similar to that of female psychoneurotic out-patients (47.7), although one-third of poor responders were normal. Patients who responded well to simple anticholinergic treatment had a mean score (30.7), which was similar to that of normal urban females (33.5). Most good responders and one-third of poor responders showed little evidence of psychoneuroticism: a further search for neurophysiological abnormality in idiopathic detrusor instability is needed.\r"

For both types of catheter examined, increasing balloon volume was not associated with an increased risk of free fragment formation following puncture. However, increasing volume was associated with increased free fragment formation when the balloon burst spontaneously. In view of the high risk of free fragment formation, cystoscopy should be performed in all cases of spontaneous catheter balloon rupture or after percutaneous balloon puncture.\r"

Pre-operative urine was cultured and prostatic chips (170 cases) were also cultured to define the source of any infection. The use of antibiotics was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative bacteriuria. No serious complications occurred, although 1 patient in the antiseptic treated group developed rigors; 79 of 170 patients (46%) had positive prostatic chip cultures, of whom 74 had sterile pre-operative urine. There was no association between the result of chip culture and the presence of a pre-operative catheter. Culture positive patients had an increased risk of post-operative urine infection, although the same organism was found in the prostate and urine in only 36% of cases of post-operative bacteriuria and in 43 (54%) the organism cultured from the prostate was Staphylococcus albus. This study provides further evidence of the benefit of true prophylactic antibiotic therapy for transurethral prostatic surgery and the prostatic chip data suggest that some of the risk is due to pre-operative contamination of the prostate in the absence of per-operative urinary infection or catheterisation.\r"

Patients without antiproliferative treatment showed no significant changes in their comparable hormone levels; 15% of all normal T values were associated with elevated levels of SHBG and E-2.

Gross haematuria and low haematocrit were the most helpful factors at the time of presentation and correlated well with severe renal injury. Hypotension was seen in 4 patients and only 1 had severe renal trauma. Suspicion of a major renal injury should be high when there is gross haematuria or a low haematocrit. In this study only 1 of 20 patients with major renal injury demonstrated clinical signs of shock. Unlike adults, hypotension does not appear to be a reliable indicator of the severity of renal injury in children and diagnostic evaluation should not be reserved only for those in shock.\r"

The improved survival beyond 20 years of age is likely to change this. In a clinical study of a group of male cystics the vasa were absent in 8 of 11 boys and epididymal abnormalities were palpable in the majority. The main cause of infertility appears to be mechanical obstruction. Whether the absence is due to a primary failure of mesonephric duct development or secondary to luminal obstruction and subsequent atrophy is not known.\r"

  ".W": "Paediatric varicocele is a well known entity but its effect on adult infertility has not been adequately clarified. Since measurement of testicular volume is currently the best method of estimating the male reproductive potential, 945 boys aged between 13 and 18 years were examined with regard to testicular volume and the incidence of varicocele. The average volumes for right and left testes were 15.087 +/- 0.237 and 14.514 +/- 0.347 ml respectively, and the incidence of varicocele was 16.7%. The incidence increased from 14.5 to 21.7% as the ages increased from 14 to 18. The differences in volume of the 2 testes in boys with varicocele were statistically significant when compared with the normal group, but this significance failed to become more pronounced when the slight varicocele group (grade I) was included with the normal group and compared with the severe varicocele group (grades II and III). There may be no significant differences between the volumes of the 2 testes in boys with varicocele when careful measurement and strict statistical analyses are applied. However, some boys in the varicocele group were found to have testicular volumes below the confidence interval (mean - SE) or under 1 SD, and the 2 testicular volumes differed in certain age groups. This group requires further follow-up. The results of this study have added further contradictory findings to the issue of paediatric varicocele in terms of testicular atrophy, estimation of potential fertility and the indications for immediate surgery. There is a need for further prospective controlled trials.\r"

To attempt to quantitate the change in visual field due to cataract, we examined 27 eyes of 26 patients before and after cataract extraction. The examination consisted of measurement of best refraction with visual acuity, visual field testing with the pupil dilated, measurement of lens opacity, determination of the intraocular pressure, and evaluation of the character of the cataract before surgery and of the posterior capsule after surgery. The results reaffirmed the detrimental effect that cataract may have on the visual field but also showed that the heterogeneity of cataracts limits the usefulness of the lens opacity meter in quantitating the extent of visual field loss due to cataract.\r"

The preliminary results indicate that normal orbital pressure ranges from 3.0 to 6.0 mm Hg. In patients with Graves' orbitopathy the values ranged from 7.0 to 15.0 mm Hg. The results suggest that the technique may have many exciting possibilities as a clinical research tool in orbital disease, and its use will result in better understanding of orbital compartment syndromes.\r"

The presence of a cilioretinal artery may in compromised discs steal flow from the peripapillary circulation and account for worsening glaucoma damage. We reviewed the records of 33 patients with unilateral cilioretinal arteries admitted for investigation of low-tension glaucoma. We looked for absolute difference between the affected and unaffected eyes as well as percent difference relative to the mean value for the two eyes and to the value for the unaffected eye in the following variables: mean defect, corrected loss variance or corrected pattern standard deviation, and adjusted neuroretinal rim area. No statistically significant differences were found. The mean disc area for the eyes with cilioretinal arteries was significantly larger than that previously reported for normal eyes. The results suggest that if vascular steal exists because of the presence of this artery, it is not of major clinical importance.\r"

The average preoperative A-pattern measured 29.4 prism dioptres (PD), and the average pattern correction was 29.3 PD. All patients had a residual pattern of 6 PD or less (average 2.3 PD). No patient experienced significant underaction of the superior oblique, and other surgical complications, such as ptosis, Brown's syndrome, and laceration of the vortex vein or superior rectus, did not occur. The procedure corrected 14 to 40 PD of A-pattern. The amount of pattern corrected was correlated with the size of the preoperative A-pattern but not with the total amount of recession done. No significant shift in esodeviation in primary position was noted in the patients who underwent only superior oblique recession. The procedure appears to be of particular value in patients with moderate superior oblique overaction. The advantages of recession of the superior oblique tendon include the potential for reversibility and reoperation, low risk of induced superior oblique palsy, allowance for asymmetric surgery and potential for adjustable suture technique.\r"

The 5-year survival with no evidence of disease was: Stage I, 74%; Stage II, 56%; and Stage III, 33%. The 5-year local in-field failure rate was: Stage I, 12%, Stage II, 27%; and Stage III, 51%. Extent of parametrial involvement, unilateral versus bilateral, may be important in determining survival and local failure. The four-year actuarial survival was 58% for unilateral involvement versus 47% for bilateral (P = 0.06), and the local failure rate was 32% for unilateral versus 45% for bilateral (P less than 0.05). When analyzed by stage, patients with Stage IIb disease with unilateral parametrial involvement showed a trend toward improved survival and decreased local failure compared with those with bilateral Stage IIb cancers (P = 0.1). The use of intracavitary irradiation significantly improved survival and reduced local failures. Furthermore, the number of intracavitary applications was important. When two or more intracavitary applications were used compared with one application, local in-field failure was significantly reduced, 29% versus 17% at 4 years (P less than 0.001), and four-year survival was improved, 60% versus 73% (P = 0.01). The four-year actuarial rate of major complications depended on the stage: Stage I, 8%; Stage II, 15%; and Stage III, 13%. There was a statistically significant increase in major complications in patients undergoing laparotomy for staging versus no laparotomy 23% versus 11% at 4 years (P less than or equal to 0.01) and a trend toward increased major complications in patients who were thin or had prior abdominal surgery. This study confirmed the stage-dependent outcome of treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix with radiation and indicated that further division of Stage IIb to indicate prognostic significance of unilateral or bilateral parametrial involvement may be warranted. This study also confirmed the importance of intracavitary radiation in optimizing control established by the 1973 PCS. It further suggests that where possible, two intracavitary insertions may yield better results than one insertion.\r"

Sixteen patients completed their induction month of therapy, two had a partial response, six had stable disease, and eight had progressive disease. Four patients had clinical toxicity preventing completion of the induction month of therapy, and one of these patients died during therapy. Significant clinical toxicities included decreased performance status, weight gain, catheter-related thromboses, infectious complications, fever, hypotension, and dyspnea or hypoxemia requiring oxygen. Thus, the addition of LAK cell infusions to this IL-2 regimen did not cause a noticeable change in antitumor response rate but did not cause more severe toxicity.\r"

Sixteen percent had moderate to severe otoxicity, 10% had nausea and vomiting, and none had nephrotoxicity.\r"

Using the same dose and schedule as in this pilot study, 38 previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma were treated with continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of 5-FU 750 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, followed by weekly bolus 5-FU at 750 mg/m2 and subcutaneous IFN at 9 million units three times per week. Of 35 evaluable patients, nine (26%) had a partial response (95% confidence limit, 11% to 41%), with a median response duration of 7.5 months (range, 4.4 to greater than 11.7 months). Seven patients (20%) had a minor response, and ten (28%) had stable disease. The most common toxicities observed were stomatitis (52%) and diarrhea (43%). Neurotoxicity was seen in 34% of patients and consisted of gait disturbance, dizziness, confusion, memory loss, and dementia. Because of toxicity, 84% of patients required a reduction of the IFN dose by at least 50%, and 63% required reduction of the 5-FU dose by at least 25%. Although the combination of 5-FU and IFN in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma has some activity, the regimen was toxic, and the observed response rate (26%) was not substantially superior to alternative 5-FU programs.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of four cycles of etoposide with ifosfamide and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy was conducted in 42 germ cell tumor (GCT) patients who were refractory to cisplatin with etoposide/vinblastine-based therapy. Forty patients were evaluable for response. Ten patients (25%) had a complete response: seven to chemotherapy alone and an additional three patients after surgical resection of viable GCT. With a median follow-up of 15 months, four complete responders relapsed, and six patients (15%) remain in remission. Hematologic and nephrotoxicity were moderately severe. Durable complete responses with VIP as second salvage were achieved and suggests that ifosfamide adds efficacy to standard first-salvage therapy. The observed nephrotoxicity and myelotoxicity are considerations in the design of ifosfamide-cisplatin-based regimens. Hematopoietic growth factors may be useful in ameliorating myelotoxicity. The early use of ifosfamide-based chemotherapy may reduce the nephrotoxicity exacerbated by prior cisplatin. A trial of VIP as first salvage after a relapse from a complete response to platinum-based induction therapy is warranted. The modest proportion of patients who achieve a durable remission to VIP as second salvage emphasizes the need for more efficacious salvage therapy for patients who do not achieve a durable complete response.\r"

After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, actuarial 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 80% and 69%, respectively, and disease-free rates were 61% and 51% at the same times. Actuarial local control rates were 80% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Fifteen patients (19%) had local recurrence, but 12 of these were salvaged. Ultimately, 53 patients (68%) retained a normal or fairly normal extremity, six (8%) needed amputation for complications, and 13 (17%) needed amputation to control recurrent disease. The functional outcome was significantly better for patients with upper extremity lesions than for those with lower extremity tumors; even for the latter, this treatment strategy was preferable to amputation. The incidence of hematogenous metastases from distal extremity sarcomas depends on the size of the primary tumor. It was concluded that conservation surgery and radiation therapy (XRT) is an acceptable treatment strategy for STS arising in distal extremities; it yielded a high rate of disease control and functional limb preservation.\r"

Induction therapy consisted of a 35-day course of daunomycin, vincristine, and prednisone, immediately followed by teniposide, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and L-asparaginase. Intrathecal methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and Ara-C were given through the induction/consolidation phase. Twenty-three of 27 patients achieved remission by the end of induction/consolidation. Maintenance with the same drugs in a modified dosage schedule continued for approximately 2 years. A small subgroup of patients who were M3 at day 35 but M1 at day 56 (end of induction/consolidation) and had a cumulative event-free survival (EFS) of only 0.40 at 6 months, all had relapsed by 15 months. However, the EFS for M1 patients by day 35 and maintained on chemotherapy was 0.64 at 12 months and 0.32 at 30, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Although good reinduction and remission duration rates at 12 to 24 months were achieved and an apparent plateau in survival occurs at 30 months, fall-off in survival would not be unexpected with probably less than 20% alive after 5 years.\r"

  ".U": "91064683\r", 
  ".W": "Elective irradiation of sites of potential occult tumor spread is often part of a patient's radiation therapy program. The required radiation dose (D) depends on the probability that occult disease exists (P(occ)), the number of sites at risk (A), the number of tumor clonogens present (Ni), their radiation sensitivity, and the desired control rate. An exponential model of cell survival is used to quantify the importance of these factors. Control Probability = [1 - Pocc x (1 - e-Ni x (SF2)D/2)]A; SF2 = surviving fraction after 2 Gy. Implications for clinical radiation therapy include: 1. Since the number of clonogens in an occult site may vary from 10 degrees to 10(8), Ni is the major determinant of the required dose. The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of the clonogens (SF2) is also extremely important in determining the dose. Other factors are less influential since they vary less. 2. The variability of Ni (8 logs) is larger than the variation in cell number seen with gross disease (1 cm3 versus 1000 cm3, 3 logs). When Ni approximately 10(8), the required dose approaches that needed for small volume gross disease (10(9) cells, 1 cm3). 3. The dose prescribed to elective sites should reflect the risk of occult disease based on the primary tumor site, stage, and grade. 4. Regions where clinicoradiologic evaluation is difficult (e.g., pelvis and obese neck) require higher doses because macroscopic tumor deposits may exist. 5. Relatively low doses (10 to 30 Gy) are often thought to be inadequate for microscopic tumor. However, similar doses have been reported to sterilize microscopic tumor in ovarian, rectal, bladder, breast, and head and neck carcinomas. Relatively low doses should not be discounted since they may be useful in select cases when normal tissue tolerances and/or previous irradiation treatment limit the radiation dose.\r"

With current therapy, the outcome of this disease is invariably fatal. The authors present a case of primary CNS lymphoma in a 3.5-year-old girl with AIDS who received treatment with total brain irradiation. After treatment, the patient's mental status improved, the seizures resolved, and she had no further progression of her neurologic symptoms until she died of pneumonia 6 months later. The autopsy revealed a necrotic mass at the site of the original tumor. The brain stem and spinal cord, unirradiated, contained lymphomatous lesions. The patient had extensive fibrinoid necrosis and leukoencephalopathy that were consistent with radiation-induced CNS damage. Coexisting AIDS encephalopathy also contributed to the patient's CNS injury. Effective palliation of CNS lymphoma in children with AIDS may be obtained with cranial irradiation. Pediatric AIDS patients may show more severe tissue effects from irradiation than unaffected children.\r"

Relapse-free rates were strong functions of pelvic lymph node metastases and cervical size. The recurrence distribution consisted of 4% isolated local, 13% isolated distant, and 17% combined local and distant failures. With the assumption of independent local and distant failure probabilities, Suit et al.'s method was extended to assess potential improvement in cure attainable with perfect local and distant control, yielding local (LSA) and distant (DSA) survival advantages of 17% and 28%. Various subsets of clinical stage, cervical size, pelvic node metastases, periaortic metastases, and peritoneal metastases had LSA from 12% to 27% and DSA from 12% to 71%. For any prognostic group, LSA never exceeded DSA, showing that effective systemic therapy would have a greater impact on improving survival than would advances in local and regional tumor control. Therapeutic implications and limitations of the extended LSA-DSA model are discussed. This form of analysis can be used to guide the intensity of local and distant treatment to maximize the cure of the patient with cancer.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective search of patients seen at the Duke Melanoma Clinic from 1970 to 1986 identified 308 clinically Stage I patients, with 4.0 to 10.0 mm cutaneous melanomas. Five-year and ten-year survival was 56% and 43%, respectively. Elective lymph node dissection (ELND) was done in 116 patients (37.7%); there was no difference in disease-free interval (DFI) or survival between these patients versus patients treated with wide excision only (P = 0.9). Thirty-two patients (27.6%) had pathologically positive nodes on ELND. These patients had a shorter DFI (P = 0.05) and survival (P = 0.03) compared with patients with negative node dissections. When further divided by Breslow's thickness, this difference persisted in patients with 4.0 to 6.0 mm lesions (P = 0.01). However, for thicker lesions (greater than 6.0 mm), there was no difference in survival between the node-negative and node-positive groups (P = 0.9). The mean follow-up was 7.1 years. Elective lymph node dissection was not done in 192 patients; 78 of these recurred first in the regional nodes. These 78 patients were compared with the 32 patients who had pathologically positive nodes by ELND to see if patient survival was improved by early removal of nodal disease. There was no difference in DFI (P = 0.5) or survival (P = 0.3) between these two groups. It is concluded that ELND may provide prognostic information for patients with thick cutaneous melanomas. However, there was no change in DFI or ultimate survival when patients were followed, and nodes removed when clinically positive. The authors do not recommend ELND for patients with thick melanomas because the risk of distant metastases outweighs any benefit of regional node dissection.\r"

They compared total colonoscopy (TC) and air-contrast (ACBE) and single-contrast barium enema (SCBE) findings with those obtained at necropsy in rats with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. Gastrograffin enemas with bisacodyl suppositiories showed complete evacuation of solid feces. Sprague-Dawley rats treated with DMH had their colons cleansed and then underwent TC (5.0-mm Olympus bronchoscope) and either SCBE or ACBE. Colonoscopy and ACBE were equally sensitive (81.5% and 76.3%, respectively), although SCBE was significantly insensitive in identifying lesions (P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that: (1) mechanical cleansing of the rat colon is feasible, (2) TC and barium radiology can be done routinely after mechanical cleansing, and (3) TC and double-contrast BE are sensitive in identifying colon lesions. These techniques will provide a means for manipulation of murine tumors and in vivo surveillance.\r"

Epithelial tumors, considered to be derived from or differentiating toward hair follicle such as trichilemmoma (one of one, VHES) and basal cell epithelioma (BCE) (32 of 32, VHES) were labeled not only in the peripheral cells but in their entirety. On the other hand, epidermal tumors, such as seborrheic keratosis (ten of 11, OPES), actinic keratosis (two of three, OPES), and squamous cell carcinoma (one of two, OPES), showed an irregular peripheral basal cell staining as in normal epidermis. The apocrine sweat apparatus and eccrine secretory portion were negative. Eccrine ductal tumors such as syringoma (two tested), eccrine acrospiroma (one), and eccrine carcinoma (two) were TNKH1 negative. Taking advantage of this total labeling of BCE versus peripheral labeling of the hair follicle, the authors could distinguish BCE tissue from other structures clearly. Among confusing structures the upper hair follicle and the eccrine duct were excluded easily because of their negative staining with TNKH1. The lower hair follicle was TNKH1 positive but only in the outer basal layer, whereas the BCE was TNKH1 positive in its entire basaloid cells. The result indicated that TNKH1 will be a useful antibody in Mohs' micrographic surgery.\r"

In two of these cases histiocyte-associated markers were also expressed. In these cases histopathologic and extensive in situ immunophenotypic analyses were used with genotypic studies in the determination of cell lineage. A sinusoid histologic pattern of involvement with partial lymph node infiltration by pleomorphic neoplastic cells was noticed in the nodes from both patients. Solid areas of node replacement resembling metastatic carcinoma were seen in Patient 1. Immunohistologically, tumor cells of both cases were positive for CD30, CD25, CD71, LN3 (HLA-DR), EMA, CD45, CD74, vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and CD68. Patient 1 was also CD45RO+, CD43+, whereas Patient 2 was positive for alpha-1-antitrypsin and CD4 tumor cells. Genotypic studies revealed that TCR beta and TCR gamma chain genes were clonally rearranged in Patient 1, whereas no rearrangements were detected in Patient 2. This study supports the view that some Ki-1 anaplastic large cell lymphomas may express multiple histiocyte-associated antigens and confirms that this group of neoplasms have immunophenotypic heterogeneity. The results of genotypic analyses used with immunophenotyping does not exclude that the tumor cells in these cases may be of true histiocytic origin despite the Ki-1-positive phenotype.\r"

Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.\r"

The highest prevalence of HP infection, 93%, was observed in the adult population at highest gastric cancer risk, the residents of Pasto, Colombia. In the lower risk Colombian city of Cali, a 63% overall prevalence rate was found. Both children and adults were sampled in New Orleans, Louisiana, where gastric cancer rates are high for blacks but not for whites. The prevalence of HP infection was significantly higher in black than in white adults, 70% versus 43%, P = 0.0001. A higher prevalence was also detected in black compared with white children, 49% versus 32%, P = 0.01; however, an even greater disparity was noted when comparing children from two hospitals, regardless of race, which serve different socioeconomic groups. A prevalence rate of 54% was found at Charity Hospital compared with 24% (P = 0.0001) at Children's Hospital. Our findings indicate that socioeconomic conditions, known to influence gastric cancer risk, are also important determinants of HP infection.\r"

Four specific MoAb reacting only with PLAP and two nonspecific MoAb reacting equally with isozymes of alkaline phosphatase (hepatic, intestinal, and placental) were obtained. Immunohistochemical staining with the specific MoAb showed that the cell membrane and cytoplasm of cancer cells were stained in gastric and colorectal carcinoma. The incidence of PLAP positivity was 23% (25 of 107) of all gastric carcinomas. Among gastric carcinomas, the 42% (13 of 31) positivity of highly differentiated carcinoma (papillary adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was a significantly higher rate than that found in poorly differentiated carcinoma (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma, five of 41, 12%). The incidence of PLAP positivity was 11% (four of 35) in colorectal carcinoma. In contrast, gastric adenoma, intestinal metaplasia, and noncancerous tissue adjacent to cancer did not show staining. These results indicated that expression of PLAP was apt to occur in more highly differentiated gastric carcinoma and was highly specific for carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract, although its incidence was not high.\r"

This phenomenon might be used for histopathologic evaluation of neoplasms of the bladder. The authors studied the clinicopathologic data and tissue specimens of 125 cases of urothelial carcinomas collected prospectively. Penetration of the BM was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of the BM components laminin and type IV collagen. The use of this parameter as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer was assessed. The 5-year survival rate of patients having tumors with an interrupted or absent BM was significantly lower than that of patients having tumors with an intact BM. The rate of progression was greater in tumors with an interrupted or absent BM than in tumors with an intact BM. No association was found between BM status and recurrence. However, a significant correlation between tumor stage and BM staining was found. A correlation was also found between ploidy and BM staining as well as between histologic grade and BM staining pattern. When evaluating histologic grade, stage, ploidy, age, and BM score as prognostic parameters, the stage of bladder carcinomas turned out to be the most important factor in predicting the survival rate and the progression-free survival. However, BM staining was found to be of value for early identification of microinvasion and is helpful for correct staging of urothelial carcinomas.\r"

The authors report the clinical, histologic, and immunoperoxidase findings on 20 cases recorded at the Alberta Cancer Registry over the last 23 years. These cases were then added to material on 257 cases abstracted from the literature and analyzed. It was found that there are two clinicopathologic types of PBL. The first affects pregnant or lactating women with bilateral, diffuse disease, is rapidly fatal, and corresponds histologically to a Burkitt's-type lymphoma. The second is unilateral at presentation and afflicts a broad age range, but primarily older women. This has a variable course only part of which is predicted by histologic grade and stage. Tumor size, treatment, and side of presentation were not found to be significant prognostic factors. Histologically, these tumors can be grouped into large cell B-cell lymphomas, monocytoid B-cell lymphomas (MBCL), and undifferentiated, some of which may be T-cell. Evidence suggesting that the MBCL of breast are the equivalent of the malignant lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) is reviewed. The breast is a hormone-dependent member of the MALT and therefore it is interesting that two of these tumors were strongly positive for estrogen receptors.\r"

In addition, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA (types 6/11, 16/18, or 31/33/35) was analyzed by in situ hybridization. In the normal cervix, basal cells of the squamous epithelium, metaplastic cells, and endocervical glandular cells were ER positive. In contrast, neoplastic cells of CIN (17 of 21 cases) and invasive carcinoma (19 of 21 cases) were ER negative. The remaining four cases of CIN and two cases of invasive carcinoma were focally ER positive. The HPV DNA analysis revealed that HPV DNA in ER-negative cases was either types 16/18 or undetectable, but all ER-positive neoplasms contained HPV DNA types 31/33/35. These results suggest that most neoplastic cells in CIN and invasive cervical carcinoma lose their ER expression and that this may be related to the HPV DNA types which they possess.\r"

They interpreted such phenomena regarding cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The tissue expression of the antigens was compared with preoperative serum levels. Several different factors were found to cause the simultaneous elevation of two or three of these markers in the serum. Furthermore, even when the levels of some of the tumor markers were raised in the serum, the ovarian tumor did not always produce the marker by itself. This study indicates that immunohistochemical identification of a marker in tumor tissue is prerequisite to the use of that marker in the serum to monitor disease status.\r"

The localization of these tumors was in the proximity of a bone, but not attached to the periosteum or in continuity with a joint. Because these lesions may be mistaken for other cartilaginous neoplasms of soft tissue, recognition of this entity has potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic implications in that mutilating surgery may be avoided.\r"

All patients were seen at least 5 years postdiagnosis. Dental abnormalities were determined from panoramic radiographs, and craniofacial evaluations were made from lateral cephalometric radiographs. Ninety-one (94%) of all patients and 41 (100%) of patients younger than 5 years of age at diagnosis had abnormal dental development. The severity of these abnormalities was greater in children who received treatment before 5 years of age and in those who received RT. Observed dental abnormalities included tooth agenesis, arrested root development, microdontia, and enamel dysplasias. Craniofacial abnormalities occurred in 18 of 20 (90%) of those patients who received chemotherapy plus 2400-cGy RT before 5 years of age. Mean cephalometric values of this group showed significant deficient mandibular development. The results of this study suggest that the severity of dentofacial-developmental abnormalities secondary to antileukemia therapy are related to the age of the patient at the initiation of treatment and the use of cranial RT.\r"

In 40 patients fallopian tube cancer was the only primary, but in 24 patients primary fallopian tube cancer was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. Of the 40 patients with unifocal fallopian disease, the median survival was 28 months. Only 15% of patients were alive and disease free with follow-up ranging from 22 to 141 months (median, 90.5 months). Survival was not associated with stage of disease, tumor histology, grade, or depth of invasion in this series. Fourteen patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy were evaluable for response. Three patients (21%) responded; two complete and one partial. Twelve patients without clinical evidence of disease underwent second-look procedures, ten laparotomy and two laparoscopy. Four of ten second-look laparotomies were negative. Secondary debulking was done in three of four patients with gross disease, one of which had a negative third-look laparotomy. Negative laparotomy, second-look or third-look, was associated with improved survival (P = 0.016). One of the two laparoscopies was negative, but the patient recurred. In the remaining 24 patients cancer of the fallopian tube was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. In 12 patients tubal disease was invasive, and in 12, it was in situ. Separate primaries occurred in the ovaries (n = 20); uterus (n = 7); and cervix (n = 2). This represents 1.3% of ovarian malignancies treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute during the study period. Fallopian tube cancer seems as virulent as ovarian cancer with few long-term survivors. It is frequently associated with other sites of upper genital tract malignancy. Second-look laparotomy is an important predictor of survival. Second-look laparoscopy may be useful if positive.\r"

Significant increases in cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking were observed in whites and blacks; however, the dose-response patterns appeared to differ by race. In whites, statistically significant elevations of threefold and higher were observed in the odds ratios at all smoking levels above 20 pack-years, whereas in blacks, the corresponding point estimates did not increase significantly until greater than 60 pack-years of smoking. Although these risk patterns are compatible with the higher incidence of bladder cancer in white men, the sample of blacks was small, and tests of significance were only suggestive of higher risks for whites at specific amounts of smoking (P less than 0.15). Effects of alcohol consumption were inconsistent, and there was no detectable synergism between smoking and drinking. Additional study of race-specific risk factors and tobacco metabolism will be needed to determine the true nature of the apparent racial differences in the risk of urinary bladder cancer associated with cigarette smoking.\r"

Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure. Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11. No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred.

  ".W": "The relative importance of N-hydroxylation and acetylation of dapsone to the oral clearance of dapsone (100 mg) was investigated in seven healthy volunteers. Plasma dapsone and monoacetyldapsone concentrations rose rapidly with subsequent similar monoexponential elimination. The oral clearance of dapsone was low (33 +/- 14 ml/min), with a threefold variability. Four subjects were identified as fast acetylators; however, differences in acetylation did not explain the variability in oral clearance. The cumulative urinary recoveries of dapsone and its hydroxylamine were approximately 20% of the dose. The formation clearance of hydroxylamine, which exhibited a tenfold intersubject variability, was closely associated with the oral clearance of dapsone (r = 0.96). Thus, the formation of the hydroxylamine is more important than acetylation in determining dapsone's intersubject variability in oral clearance. Variation in N-hydroxylation may have clinical consequences, because the hydroxylamine is considered to be important in dapsone-mediated toxicity.\r"

After oral administration of 40 mg xipamide, the diuretic was rapidly distributed in the blood and the ascites. The ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of plasma and ascitic fluid was 7:2, as was the protein content in the respective compartments. The AUC in plasma of cirrhotic patients was significantly greater than in control subjects (p less than 0.001). The most striking finding was the increase of the amount (Ae) of parent drug and main metabolite excreted into the urine (p less than 0.001). The renal clearance of xipamide was only moderately reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis. Both AUC and Ae were positively correlated to the plasma concentration of direct bilirubin of the patients (p less than 0.05). We concluded that nonrenal drug clearance in patients with liver cirrhosis was reduced as a result of the blockade of hepatobiliary excretion during cholestatic conditions.\r"

The apparent total body clearance of R-mephobarbital was much greater and the elimination half-life was much shorter in the young men compared with the other three groups. This enantiomer displayed an age-dependent gender effect and a gender-dependent age effect in its metabolism. The apparent total body clearance of the S-enantiomer was much lower than that of the R-enantiomer in all subjects and did not differ between subject groups, although the elimination half-life was slightly but significantly shorter in young males. A consequence of these enantiomeric differences was an apparently enhanced stereoselectivity in the metabolism of mephobarbital in young men. These substantial influences of age and gender on the stereoselective disposition of mephobarbital are consistent with recent findings concerning the expression and regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes.\r"

Metabolites A and G were of particular interest because, in smokers, they both persisted longer than cotinine.

Within doses, six healthy male volunteers received these treatments in a double-blind crossover design. No clinically significant changes were observed in blood pressure, pulse, respiration, or clinical laboratory test results. Untoward effects were typical of benzodiazepines. Adinazolam and NDMAD kinetics were dose independent. Greater than 95% of the adinazolam dose was metabolized to NDMAD. Adinazolam and NDMAD mesylate produced dose-related increases in uric acid clearance and decreases in plasma uric acid. Both adinazolam and NDMAD mesylate administration resulted in dose-related sedation and decrements in psychomotor performance. Within doses, decrements produced by adinazolam and NDMAD were quantitatively similar. These results suggest that both adinazolam and NDMAD possess uricosuric activity and support the hypothesis that NDMAD primarily mediates benzodiazepine-like effects of adinazolam mesylate.\r"

Equal numbers of black and white patients were enlisted to form four treatment groups (white patients taking either labetalol or atenolol and black patients taking either labetalol or atenolol). Two hundred ninety-two patients (152 white and 140 black patients) with essential hypertension characterized by a standing diastolic blood pressure of 105 to 119 mm Hg (inclusive) were recruited for this trial. Patients were randomized to either labetalol (dosage titrated from 200 to 1600 mg/day) or atenolol (dosage titrated from 50 to 100 mg/day). The therapeutic goal was achievement of a standing diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or a fall of 15 mm Hg in diastolic pressure from baseline value at the end of the placebo run in period. At the end of the study there were no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate changes in the supine position between the labetalol and atenolol groups. In contrast, labetalol produced greater reduction in both the standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-12/-13 mm Hg, respectively) compared with atenolol (-7/-9 mm Hg; p less than 0.05; p less than 0.005, respectively). The greatest decrease in blood pressure was observed in white patients receiving labetalol. In black patients the decrease in blood pressure was greater in those treated with labetalol compared with atenolol, particularly with respect to the systolic blood pressure. We conclude that the alpha 1-blocking property of labetalol provides an additional lowering of the blood pressure over that seen with beta 1-blockade alone, especially in the standing position, and this enhanced efficacy is not confined to one radical group.\r"

The cosegregation of the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine with the sparteine oxidation polymorphism was confirmed. Hence morphine could not be detected in the plasma of any of the poor metabolizers, whereas detectable morphine plasma levels were found in 10 of 12 extensive metabolizers. Pain thresholds to laser stimuli were determined before drug intake and 90, 150, and 210 minutes after drug intake. Codeine significantly increased the pricking pain thresholds in the extensive metabolizers (p less than 0.05), whereas there were no significant changes in the poor metabolizers. No change in pain thresholds occurred with placebo in any of the two phenotypes. In the extensive metabolizers there was a significant positive correlation between the increase in pain threshold and plasma concentration of codeine. The study supports the hypothesis that morphine formation is essential for achievement of analgesia during codeine treatment.\r"

Possible mechanisms for elevated noradrenaline concentrations in patients with congestive heart failure include increased noradrenaline secretion, decreased clearance of noradrenaline, and a combination of increased secretion and decreased clearance. 3. In the present study, plasma noradrenaline clearance and apparent secretion rates were determined using a whole-body steady-state radionuclide tracer method in six otherwise healthy patients with moderate degrees of low-output cardiac failure and in six normal control subjects. 4. The venous plasma noradrenaline level was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure as compared with the control subjects (4.18 +/- 1.34 versus 1.54 +/- 0.16 nmol/l, P less than 0.05). There was no stimulation of the adrenal medulla as evident by normal plasma adrenaline levels in both groups (0.19 +/- 0.04 versus 0.18 +/- 0.02 nmol/l, not significant). The apparent secretion rate of noradrenaline was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure (4.75 +/- 1.95 versus 1.78 +/- 0.18 nmol min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05), whereas the clearance rate of noradrenaline was similar in the two groups (1.26 +/- 0.27 versus 1.16 +/- 0.02 l min-1 m-2, not significant). 5. We conclude that the high peripheral venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations in patients with mildly decompensated low-output cardiac failure are initially due to increased secretion, rather than to decreased metabolic clearance, perhaps in response to diminished effective arterial blood volume.\r"

Using the forearm balance method, together with systemic infusions of L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine and L-[1-14C]leucine, we examined the effects of infused branched-chain amino acids on whole-body and skeletal muscle amino acid kinetics in 10 postabsorptive normal subjects; 10 control subjects received only saline. 2. Infusion of branched-chain amino acids caused a four-fold rise in arterial branched-chain amino acid levels and a two-fold rise in branched-chain keto acids; significant declines were observed in circulating levels of most other amino acids, including phenylalanine, which fell by 34%. Plasma insulin levels were unchanged from basal levels (8 +/- 1 mu-units/ml). 3. Whole-body phenylalanine flux, an index of proteolysis, was significantly suppressed by branched-chain amino acid infusion (P less than 0.002), and forearm phenylalanine production was also inhibited (P less than 0.03). With branched-chain amino acid infusion total leucine flux rose, with marked increments in both oxidative and non-oxidative leucine disposal (P less than 0.001). Proteolysis, as measured by endogenous leucine production, showed a modest 12% decrease, although this was not significant when compared with saline controls. The net forearm balance of leucine and other branched-chain amino acids changed from a basal net output to a marked net uptake (P less than 0.001) during branched-chain amino acid infusion, with significant stimulation of local leucine disposal. Despite the rise in whole-body non-oxidative leucine disposal, and in forearm leucine uptake and disposal, forearm phenylalanine disposal, an index of muscle protein synthesis, was not stimulated by infusion of branched-chain amino acids. 4. The results suggest that in normal man branched-chain amino acid infusion suppresses skeletal muscle proteolysis independently of any rise of plasma insulin. Muscle branched-chain amino acid uptake rose dramatically in the absence of any apparent increase in muscle protein synthesis, as measured by phenylalanine disposal, or in branched-chain keto acid release. Thus, an increase in muscle branched-chain amino acid concentrations and/or local branched-chain amino acid oxidation must account for the increased disposal of branched-chain amino acids.\r"

The SC5b-9 complex and the Bb fragment concentrations remained at a plateau until 120 min thereafter. The iC3b fragment level showed a continual decline. 3. The C4d fragment concentrations remained unchanged, indicating that generation of the membrane attack complex is most likely due only to activation of the alternative pathway. 4. The generation of the membrane attack complex occurred throughout the full haemodialysis period. In patients treated with Polysulfon membranes no statistically significant variation in these components was noted. 5. The study shows that the membrane attack complex may be generated during the full period of the haemodialysis session and is a stable index of biocompatibility. 6.

In 27 patients with chronic renal failure, plasma histamine levels were analysed by radioimmunoassay and were compared with those of 40 healthy adult subjects. The control population showed plasma histamine concentrations of 185 +/- 33 pg/ml, which were significantly lower than those of the patients with renal insufficiency. The highest levels (552 +/- 116 pg of histamine/ml) were found in 16 patients with chronic renal failure (mean serum creatinine 5.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl) and severe itching. 3. Twelve patients with pronounced pruritus who were on maintenance haemodialysis (serum creatinine 9.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dl) had a mean plasma histamine concentration of 515 +/- 81 pg/ml. Fifteen patients on regular haemodialysis (serum creatinine 9.0 +/- 1.5 mg/dl) and who experienced itching had plasma histamine levels (322 +/- 40 pg/ml) which were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than those of the patients with pruritus but which were elevated compared with those of the control population (P less than 0.01). 4. No correlation could be found between increased plasma histamine levels and the type of dialysis membrane used or the method of sterilization of the membrane. 5. Haemodialysis alone did not reduce plasma histamine concentrations, although high concentrations could be detected in the ultrafiltrate. In six patients a rapid decrease in plasma histamine concentration from 565 +/- 134 pg/ml to within the normal range could be detected after 60 min of combined haemodialysis and haemoperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood glucose concentrations were not markedly different in septic rats, but lactate, pyruvate and alanine concentrations were markedly increased, compared with sham-operated rats. Conversely, blood ketone body concentrations were significantly decreased in septic rats. Both plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were markedly elevated in response to sepsis. 3. The maximal activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49) were markedly decreased in kidneys obtained from septic rats, suggesting diminished renal gluconeogenesis. 4. Renal concentrations of lactate, pyruvate and other gluconeogenetic intermediates were markedly elevated in septic rats, whereas those of acetyl-CoA and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were decreased and unchanged, respectively. 5. The rate of gluconeogenesis from added lactate, pyruvate and glycerol was decreased in isolated incubated renal tubules from septic rats. 6. Sepsis decreased the arteriovenous concentration difference for glucose, lactate, and alanine. Septic rats showed decreased net rates of glucose production and net rates of removal of lactate and alanine as compared with sham-operated controls. 7. It is concluded that the diminished capacity for renal gluconeogenesis in septic rats could be the result of changes in the maximal activities or regulation of key non-equilibrium gluconeogenic enzymes or both, but the effect of other factors (e.g. toxins) has not been excluded.\r"

Resting skeletal muscle pH and unstimulated leucocyte pH values were similar to those in control subjects, but increased Na+/H+ antiport activity was demonstrated in the leucocytes from hypertensive subjects by acid loading in vitro. Decreased skeletal muscle acidification and an increased rate of pH recovery was also demonstrated in vivo in these same patients during an acid load induced by isotonic exercise. 4. These findings suggest that the increased cellular Na+/H+ antiport activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro in essential hypertension, also affects the biochemical response of skeletal muscle to physiological levels of exercise. This strengthens the argument that increased Na+/H+ antiport activity in hypertension is a generalized and physiologically relevant cellular abnormality.\r"

Twenty-four hearts were studied. 2. They were perfused with two different, modified, Krebs-Henseleit solutions at a fixed left atrial pressure. 3. Acute changes in pressure, both increases and decreases, were arrhythmogenic. Whilst ectopic activity was more predictably produced by pressure reductions, this consisted of simple ventricular ectopics only. Pressure increases, in contrast, were capable of provoking more complex and sustained arrhythmias. 4. The effect of pressure changes were highly dependent upon electrolyte concentrations in the perfusate. Low potassium and magnesium concentrations increased the amount of arrhythmia provoked by pressure increases but tended to reduce that provoked by pressure reductions. 5. We conclude that the direct effect of an acute change in pressure upon the myocardium is arrhythmogenic. However, the myocardial response to a pressure change is interdependent upon prevailing electrolyte concentrations.\r"

This study was conducted to determine whether women with pregnancy-induced hypertension are able to stimulate release of active renin. 2. Active plasma renin concentration was measured as the generation of angiotensin I at physiological pH in the presence of excess renin substrate, and total renin concentration was determined in the same way after trypsin activation. Inactive plasma renin concentration was calculated as the difference between total renin and active plasma renin concentrations. 3. Resting active plasma renin concentration was significantly greater in third-trimester primigravidae compared with normotensive non-pregnant women and active plasma renin and total renin concentrations rose significantly without a fall in inactive plasma renin concentration in both groups after 2 h ambulation, suggesting increased release of active plasma renin and not conversion of circulating inactive to active renin. These responses were blunted in women taking oral contraceptives. 4. Although the active plasma renin concentration was significantly reduced in third-trimester primigravidae with pregnancy-induced hypertension, total renin concentration was not significantly different compared with normotensive women of similar gestation and in both groups 30 min 60 degrees head-up tilt increased active but not inactive plasma renin concentration. 5. These studies show that in normal pregnancy active plasma renin concentration can be stimulated to a similar extent as in non-pregnant women, despite a higher resting level. This appears to be due to increased secretion of active plasma renin rather than conversion of circulating inactive to active renin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the acute effects of insulin and triacylglycerol ('triglyceride') on circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 concentrations, seven healthy volunteers were studied during hyperinsulinaemic clamps in the presence of euglycemia (mean glucose concentration 5 mmol/l) and hyperglycaemia (mean glucose concentration 9 mmol/l) with and without triacylglycerol infusions. 2. During euglycemia, plasma insulin levels rose from baseline values [median (range)] of 13 (6.6-20.6) m-units/l to 89 (74-105) m-units/l and 99 (74-109) m-units/l after 1 and 2 h of insulin infusion, respectively. Concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 fell from 27.5 (10-47) ng/ml to 25.0 (14.5-55) ng/ml and 15.5 (11.5-28.5) ng/ml (P less than 0.02) over the same time. 3. During hyperglycaemia, plasma insulin concentrations were 12.1 (9.3-17.1) m-units/l at the run-in period and rose to 87 (73-112) m-units/l and 91 (84-97) m-units/l after 1 and 2 h of insulin infusion, respectively. Concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 again showed a gradual fall from 24.7 (22-50) ng/ml to 14 (8.3-25.5) ng/ml and 13 (6.0-35.0) ng/ml (P less than 0.02) over the same period. 4. Infusion of Intralipid in the presence of hyperinsulinaemia with either euglycemia or hyperglycaemia was associated with a similar fall in concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 over the study period. 5. The results from this study indicate that short-term increases in insulin, glucose or triacylglycerol do not cause acute increases in plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.\r"

The responses of blood pressure, heart rate, autonomic function and plasma insulin to a high carbohydrate and a high fat meal of equivalent energy value were studied in nine young volunteers. 2. Neither meal produced a significant change in supine or erect blood pressure. The high carbohydrate meal, however, resulted in an overall rise in both supine (6 beats/min) and erect (6 beats/min; P less than 0.05) heart rate, no such changes being seen after the high fat meal. 3. Plasma noradrenaline levels increased by a maximum of 126% at 90 min (0.98 to 2.22 nmol/l) after the high carbohydrate meal but were virtually unchanged after the high fat meal (P less than 0.01). Parasympathetic function showed no between-meal differences. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were significantly higher after the high carbohydrate meal than after the high fat meal. No postprandial difference in packed cell volume was found between meal types. 4. We conclude that, in young subjects, the postprandial blood pressure after a high carbohydrate meal is maintained by an increase in heart rate associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity. These changes are at variance with the blood pressure and heart rate responses seen in the elderly after a high carbohydrate meal. A high fat meal has no significant cardiovascular or neuroendocrine effects in the young or old. The nutrient composition of meals has to be taken into account when studying the postprandial cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses in the young.\r"

The procedure produced plasma concentrations (means +/- SEM) of urea of 7.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l in control and 39 +/- 2 mmol/l in uraemic rats, and of creatinine of 41 +/- 1 mumol/l in control and 133 +/- 7 mumol/l in uraemic rats. 3. Uraemia reduced the rates of protein synthesis in liver, heart and muscle by 35 +/- 5, 4.0 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 0.6%/day, respectively, compared with control rats (P less than 0.01). Since the reductions in tissue growth rate were too small to be accounted for by the reduction seen in protein synthesis alone, this implied that protein degradation was also reduced. Uraemia also caused an 18% reduction in the rate of growth as measured by the increase in tail length (P less than 0.01). 4. Uraemia reduced both protein synthesis and protein degradation. Protein synthesis exceeded protein degradation in all tissues. This would cause a reduced rate of protein accumulation in the uraemic compared with the control rats, and hence a reduced rate of growth.\r"

Diagnosis can be masked by the underlying cause, preemptive antibiotic treatment, or the now frequently associated debilitating diseases. With no other specific investigation, the main diagnostic test remains diagnostic thoracentesis. When an empyema is encountered, the objectives are to save life; eliminate the empyema, its complications, and chronicity; return pulmonary mechanics to normal; and reduce the duration of the hospital stay. The introduction of antibiotics has dramatically influenced the spectrum of the disease now encountered. If the original infection is adequately treated, empyema rarely occurs. Penicillin has removed the major cause of empyema, and further developments in antibiotics now mean that the majority of empyemas occur when patients are disabled by other disease processes or malnutrition, or where there remains a delay in medical attention. These patients are often less able to withstand the prolongation of the infective processes that is sometimes encountered with the staged approach to treatment. Developments in operative and postoperative care have meant that these patients can best be treated by more aggressive and definitive surgical management.\r"

Although rare, postpharyngitis complications arise as a result of disease caused almost exclusively by group A streptococcus. Because group A streptococcal pharyngitis usually responds well to antimicrobial treatment, it is important to diagnose it. Penicillin, erythromycin, and peroral first-generation cephalosporins have been documented to be effective. In addition to group A streptococcus, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae have also been detected in patients with pharyngitis. The possibility of diagnosing these organisms is limited at the present. Clinical surveys are still needed, moreover, to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the disease caused by these organisms. Although routine viral diagnostic methods do not help primary care physicians in treating patients with pharyngitis, information on bacteria and viruses in the immediate environment could prove to be of great help in daily clinical work.\r"

The prevalence and simplicity of this apparatus have encouraged its use by clinical specialists who are often not specifically trained in the safe use of x-ray equipment, and this may not be in the best interest of either the patient or the examiner. This has prompted an overview of the operating principles of videofluorescopy equipment. The factors governing image quality are discussed as well as potential hazards and protective measures for both patients and operator. A method of estimating the radiation dose to sensitive tissues from a typical swallowing study is included.\r"

  ".W": "Aspiration, or soiling of the tracheobronchial tree, can produce life-threatening pulmonary disease. Intermittent or persistent aspiration may cause symptoms including cough, intermittent fever, recurrent tracheobronchitis, atelectasis, pneumonia, and/or empyema. The pulmonary disease may be associated with weight loss, cachexia, and dehydration. In many cases the aspiration is caused by laryngeal dysfunction, allowing pulmonary contamination by swallowed material. In other cases the aspiration is caused by a dysfunction of the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing. In some cases the aspiration is caused by a combination of laryngeal and swallowing dysfunction. Geriatric patients are more likely to experience aspiration, since muscle weakness causing mechanical disability and neurologic impairment are more common in this age group. Therefore, with the ever-increasing aging of our population, these disabilities will be on the rise, with an associated increase in pulmonary disease and death. The approach to evaluation and management of these disorders must be based on an understanding of the underlying functional impairment.\r"

These findings persist despite fistula repair. A case history of an adult patient with congenital TEF is presented and the literature is reviewed. This patient is unusual in that esophageal symptoms (dysphagia) were more prominent than the usual respiratory symptoms.\r"

During velopharyngeal closure in a swallow, the pure tone component in the accelerometer signal was attenuated.

It was verified that the period of sound attenuation corresponded to the period of velar closure. This noninvasive method of monitoring otherwise silent velopharyngeal closure holds promise for normative studies on swallowing function, as an adjunct method in longitudinal assessment, and as a training aid.\r"

  ".W": "Dysphagia is a major problem in patients with neurologic disorders. Aspiration pneumonia and impaired nutritional status are consequences of dysphagia that result in high morbidity and mortality rates. Assessment and treatment of the dysphagic patient by a multidisciplinary team have been advocated but to date the effects of such an approach have not been demonstrated quantitatively. This prospective study was conducted to determine if a dysphagia program would improve patients' caloric intake and body weight, decrease the instances of aspiration pneumonia, or improve patients' feeding ability. Patients were referred from a 26 bed neurology/neurosurgery unit. A time series design was utilized. The control group consisted of 15 patients (mean age = 46.1 years), managed according to the existing ward routine. Subsequently, nursing staff attended a dysphagia training program. Following this, the treated group of 16 patients, (mean age = 49.3 years) was assessed by the dysphagia team, using bedside and videofluoroscopic examinations to determine the specific swallowing disorder. An individualized treatment program was designed for each patient. The groups were compared on the basis of deviation from their baseline weight, deviation from ideal energy intake, and the incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Statistical analysis revealed that the groups were comparable in age, number of days on the study, and Glasgow Coma Scale score; and that a significant weight gain and increase in caloric intake occurred in the treated group. No incidence of aspiration pneumonia was reported in either group. We speculate that this may have been influenced by the meticulousness of the care delivered in an acute unit as well as greater attention to prevention given in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The changes in esophageal motility after pneumatic dilatation were evaluated prospectively in 51 patients with achalasia. The patients were evaluated for a median of 14 months. Pneumatic dilatation led to a clinical improvement in 41 patients. On manometric evaluation, a significant decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure was observed (28.4 +/- 14.9 mmHg vs. 13.5 +/- 7.2 mmHg; p = 0.001); the resting pressure of the esophageal body dropped from 4.8 +/- 4.2 mmHg above gastric baseline to 0.1 +/- 3.9 mmHg below gastric baseline. After therapy, peristaltic activity was present in 10/51 (20%) patients; in 1 case, complete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter was recorded. Treatment-induced motility changes could not be predicted by clinical history or the lower esophageal sphincter pressure before or after therapy. However, the resting pressure of the esophageal body before and after therapy was significantly lower in these patients in whom peristalsis recurred after therapy than in patients with an unchanged motility pattern. The reappearance of peristaltic activity after pneumatic dilatation was unrelated to lower esophageal sphincter pressure. In conclusion, motility disturbances of the esophageal body in patients with achalasia do not simply reflect the functional obstruction of the lower esophageal sphincter. These findings support the hypothesis that achalasia is not a distinct motility disturbance but should be regarded as part of a broad spectrum of different interrelated esophageal motility disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Localization of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in the rat anterior pituitary and its changes during ontogeny and after gonadal steroid manipulations were studied by immunocytochemistry, RIA, and in situ hybridization. Colocalization studies and the combined use of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed that CGRP immunoreactivity is localized mainly in gonadotropes and alpha- and beta-CGRP messenger RNAs were detected in CGRP-immunoreactive cells. Immunoreactivity for CGRP also was detected in nerve fibers and colocalized with substance P immunoreactivity. Cells immunoreactive to CGRP antiserum were first detected in fetal rats at gestational day 18, and the incidence considerably increased between postnatal days 5 and 14. CGRP immunoreactivity was low in control adults of both sexes and in pregnant and ovariectomized females but increased in lactating, estrogen-supplemented ovariectomized and high-dose estrogen-treated females, and in high-dose estrogen-treated and castrated males. Testosterone supplement suppressed the effect of castration on CGRP immunoreactivity in males. Quantities of extractable immunoreactive CGRP under conditions of estrogen manipulation corresponded well to the immunocytochemical findings (females: controls, 96.4 +/- 13.1 fmol/gland; ovariectomized, 107.6 +/- 19.2; high-dose estrogen-treated, 212 +/- 23.0; estrogen-supplemented ovariectomized, 680 +/- 42.1). The present study suggests that pituitary CGRP is synthesized and stored in gonadotropes, is modulated by gonadal steroids, and may have a functional link with gonadotropins.\r"

  ".U": "91065225\r", 
  ".W": "Conditioned medium from cultured vascular endothelial cells contains material capable of stimulating acute metabolic processes in endothelial cells. The bioactivity of the conditioned medium is not caused by the copurification of known growth factors produced by the cells, in particular platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I/II. We now demonstrate that the bioactivity is directly due to an IGF-binding protein(s) (ECBP) and, further, that the bioactive domain of the binding protein differs from the IGF-binding domain. Binding proteins (BPs) from cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells were purified by sequential passage over sizing, multiplication-stimulating activity affinity, and hydrophobic columns. BP fractions were separated into those with and those without biological activity. The bioactive binding protein(s) was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate to IGF-I or the recombinant IGF analog [1-27,Gly4,38-70]IGF-I (Analog). The IGF-I Analog, by itself, had minimal interaction with the type I IGF receptor in cultured microvessel endothelial cells and no intrinsic bioactivity, but did bind with high affinity to ECBP. All free BP and free IGF-I/Analog were removed from the cross-linked mixture by passage over gel filtration and IGF affinity columns. The cross-linked BP-IGF-I complex did not bind to the type I receptor of cultured endothelial cells, but did stimulate glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake in endothelial cells (approximately 2-fold increase); the magnitude of the response was nearly equal to the effect of ECBP or IGF-I alone. The BP-Analog complex also stimulated glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake, with the magnitude of the response approaching the effect of ECBP alone. The BP-Analog complex also did not react with type I IGF receptors on the cultured endothelial cells. We conclude 1) IGF-BP produced by endothelial cells possess intrinsic biological activity; 2) bioactivity of the BP(s) is retained when the IGF-binding domain of the BP is occupied by IGF-I or an inactive IGF-I analog; and 3) IGF-I bound to the bioactive BP does not react with its receptor and possesses minimal, if any, bioactivity in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Although calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) has been implicated in the regulation of various steroidogenic pathways, comparatively little is known of its role in the metabolism of vitamin D. The present study was undertaken to determine whether protein kinase C is involved in the regulation of renal mitochondrial 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase), the first enzyme in the C-24 oxidation pathway, a major catabolic pathway for vitamin D metabolites in kidney and other target tissues. We examined the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C, on 24-hydroxylase activity in fresh mouse renal tubules and correlated the changes in 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25-(OH)2D3] production with translocation of protein kinase C and phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins. PMA stimulated 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis, protein kinase C translocation from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction, and phosphorylation of 30-35 K, 40 K, and 50 K mitochondrial proteins derived from 32P-labeled tubules. 4 alpha-Phorbol 12,13 didecanoate, an insert analog of PMA, did not elicit any of these effects. The synthetic diacylglycerol, oleoylacetyl glycerol, also stimulated 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitors, H-7 and staurosporine, inhibited 24-hydroxylase activity. PMA did not further stimulate 24,25-(OH)2D3 production in tubules derived from mutant (Hyp) mice in which 24-hydroxylase and protein kinase C activities are elevated relative to normal. However, after treatment with H-7, 24-hydroxylase activity was reduced in both strains, and genotype differences were no longer apparent. Finally, H-7 failed to inhibit the induced renal 24-hydroxylase in tubules isolated from 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated mice. These findings suggest a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of constitutive renal 24-hydroxylase and implicate the kinase in the aberrant expression of the hydroxylase in the Hyp mouse.\r"

  ".U": "91065227\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism whereby PTH, a potent stimulator of bone resorption, may under certain circumstances exert anabolic effects on bone is not known, but it is possible that it involves reduction of the size of osteoclast resorption lacunae. We have therefore made a detailed in vitro study of the effects of PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) on resorption by neonatal rat osteoclasts paying particular attention to the plan area of resorption pits. In order to distinguish between increased resorption at a particular site and increased numbers of sites, we have used an eyepiece graticule to define a focus of resorption, namely an area occupying 1/116th of the bone slice, which may contain either one or several pits. In addition we have studied the relationship between the number of pits in a resorption focus and the total area of bone resorbed at the focus. We found that PTH and PTHrP, at doses between 2 x 10(-10) M and 2 x 10(-8) M, while exerting significant stimulatory effects on bone resorption, caused a reduction in the median plan area of pits. An increase in the number of resorption foci was the primary stimulatory effect of PTH and PTHrP, occurring within 6 h in the case of PTH. However, the plan area of bone resorbed at a focus showed no significant increase, despite an increase in the number of pits per focus, because as more pits were formed at a focus, the pits were smaller, thus partially dissipating the stimulatory effect of PTH on resorption. These results are consistent with the activation of new remodeling sites by PTH in vivo. Furthermore, the formation of smaller pits under the resorptive influence of PTH may, together with the maintenance of coupling between formation and resorption, play a role in the preservation of cancellous bone recorded in cases of primary hyperparathyroidism and the anabolic effect of exogenous PTH.\r"

  ".W": "The content of GnRH and its precursor peptide were quantified in female rats bearing lesions in the anterior medial preoptic nucleus (AMPO) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the effects of the lesions on the synthetic activity of the GnRH neurons were evaluated. Electrolytic lesions which induced persistent estrous (PE), or irregular estrous cycles, were produced by passing 5-10 microA of direct current into the AMPO or the SCN of female rats which exhibited regular 4 days estrous cycles before the lesions. Approximately 5 weeks after lesion placement, blood samples were withdrawn from catheterized, freely moving animals and plasma LH, PRL, estrogen, and progesterone were determined by RIA. The preovulatory surges of LH and PRL were eliminated in AMPO- or SCN-lesioned PE rats. Moreover, the LH surge was eliminated and the PRL surge significantly attenuated after estrogen and progesterone treatment of rats bearing complete lesions, irrespective of the presence of ovaries. Irregular cycling animals with incomplete AMPO or SCN lesions, exhibited attenuated LH surge and PRL surge similar to proestrous controls. In one incidence this occurred spontaneously, and could also be induced by sequential estrogen and progesterone injections. After ovariectomy, plasma LH levels were significantly lower in the lesioned animals as compared to sham operated rats (P less than 0.05). Similar secretory patterns of LH and PRL were obtained from a second series of sham-operated rats during the different stages of the estrous cycle or from AMPO- or SCN-lesioned rats during persistent estrus. After 2 months the animals were killed between 0830 and 0930 h, and the preoptic area and the basal hypothalamus were microdissected from the brain sections. After extraction and purification, proGnRH and GnRH levels were measured by RIA. ProGnRH levels in the preoptic area were significantly reduced in AMPO- or in SCN-lesioned rats, compared to proestrous controls (P less than 0.01). In contrast, GnRH levels in either area did not differ in AMPO- or in SCN-lesioned animals compared to sham-operated, proestrous controls. Therefore, lesions of the AMPO or the SCN produce PE and reduce proGnRH without reducing GnRH levels. These data would suggest that the AMPO and the SCN participate in the control of the estrous cycle and are necessary for preovulatory surges of PRL and LH to occur and that the AMPO and the SCN form part of the neural circuit that regulates GnRH synthesis and/or release.\r"

Recipient rats displayed different patterns of restoration of thyroid function depending on 1) the number of thyroid cells inoculated and 2) their dietary iodine intake. We observed cell dose-dependent differences in both the rapidity and extent of thyroid function after cell transplantation. Recipients fed a normal diet and grafted with 6 x 10(4) or more cells reached near-normal levels of all three hormones. In recipients fed a low iodine diet, T4 and TSH levels remained at significantly hypothyroid levels for the duration of the 7-week study. At the highest cell dose examined (3 x 10(5)), however, serum TSH levels began to decline by the sixth to seventh week. In spite of the iodine deficiency, recovery of T3 levels in these recipients paralleled that in recipients fed normal diets. Intact control animals exhibited the anticipated pattern of decreased T4, increased TSH, and essentially unchanged T3. 125I uptake by the grafts was also dependent on the initial number of thyroid cells grafted independent of diet.\r"

  ".W": "Breast tumor cell lines have been shown to secrete several distinct polypeptide growth factors, although conflicting results exist for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In contrast a limited number of breast tumor cell lines have definitely been shown to secrete the high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modify IGF actions. To characterize the types of IGFBPs that are secreted by breast tumor cell lines, conditioned medium was collected from seven separate tumor cell lines, three of which were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and four of which were ER positive. All three of the ER negative cell lines, MDA-231, MDA-330, and HS578T, secreted binding proteins of 49,000 and 43,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) as well as 29,000 (IGFBP-1) and 24,000 Mr. In contrast, all four ER positive cell lines secreted 34,000 (IGFBP-2) or 24,000 Mr forms, and none secreted the 49,000 and 43,000 or 29,000 Mr forms. BT-20, a cell line that is positive for ER messenger RNA (mRNA) but negative for ER protein, secreted predominantly a 34,000 Mr protein. The amount of total IGFBP activity released in 24 h ranged between 0.4 and 5.6 nM equivalents of IGFBP-1, and there was no significant difference between the ER positive and negative cell lines. The MCF-7 cells that produced predominantly 34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms showed a 1.8-fold increase in IGFBP secretion after estrogen stimulation. Immunoblotting and a specific RIA for IGFBP-1 showed that only the ER negative lines MDA-330, MDA-231, and HS578T secreted this form. Northern blotting analysis for the mRNA encoding this protein showed that both MDA-330 and MDA-231 contained a single 1.6 kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with an IGFBP-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Immunoblotting analysis of the other cell lines showed that only the 34,000 Mr form secreted by the ER positive cell lines reacted with IGFBP-2 antisera. Exposure of the conditioned media from the three ER negative cell lines to N-glycanase revealed that the 49,000 and 43,000 Mr forms of IGFBP were glycosylated and therefore probably represent IGFBP-3. We conclude that ER negative cell lines secrete three forms of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and a 24,000 Mr form. In contrast, the ER positive cell lines secrete predominantly IGFBP-2 and the 24,000 Mr form but do not secrete IGFBP-3 or 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glucose transport is decreased in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of obese, hyperglycemic, insulin-resistant animals. Here we have characterized the glucose transporter(s) in muscle and adipose tissues from normal and obese mice, and we have studied the effect of a treatment with the thermogenic agent BRL 26830A. Glucose transporters were examined in crude tissue membrane fractions (microsomal + plasma membranes) by Western blot analysis using antipeptide antibodies specific for the erythroid (Glut 1) or muscle/fat (Glut 4) glucose transporters. In these insulin sensitive tissues, only Glut 4 was detected. In membranes from obese animals, the Glut 4 number was decreased by 40% +/- 4% in brown adipose tissue (mean +/- SEM of 9 preparations, P less than 0.001), whether the results were expressed per total tissue or per mg of protein. By contrast, Glut 4 number was unchanged in skeletal muscle. In white adipose tissue of obese animals, Glut 4 number per total fat pad was increased. However, due to the enlarged fat pad size, Glut 4 content was diminished when expressed per mg of white adipose tissue membrane protein in obese compared to lean animals. After a 18 day-treatment with BRL 26830A (1 or 2 mg/kg.day), glycemia of obese mice, which was slightly elevated compared to lean animals, was normalized, while insulinemia remained markedly above control values. In brown adipose tissue, the total number of Glut 4 returned to normal at 1 mg of the drug, or increased by 63% +/- 14% at 2 mg. Since membrane protein content was increased by the treatment, when results were expressed per mg of membrane protein, Glut 4 was similar in lean and BRL 26830A (1 or 2 mg) treated obese mice. BRL 26830A treatment did not modify Glut 4 in skeletal muscle, and it increased Glut 4 number in white adipose tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, in obese mice, the glucose transporter number was reduced mainly in brown adipose tissue, a defect which could contribute to the hyperglycemic syndrome. Treatment with the thermogenic agent BRL 26830A normalized in parallel glycemia and glucose transporter number in brown adipose tissue, suggesting that this tissue could play a role in glucose homeostasis in rodents.\r"

The protein consisted of three isoelectric variants (pI 5.3-6.1) of identical mol wt (23,200 +/- 900) when analyzed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of 3B3 isolated from allantoic fluid on the first 43 amino acids showed that 3B3 had 93% and 91% homology with rabbit and human plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP), respectively. The UV absorption spectrum and the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of purified 3B3 from both sources indicated the presence of bound retinol. Rabbit antiserum was raised against placental RBP (3B3) isolated from allantoic membrane culture medium. Placental RBP was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled allantois and chorion culture medium and was detected in allantoic membrane culture medium and allantoic fluid by Western blotting. These results suggested that bovine placental membranes secrete RBP into allantoic fluid and that placental RBP may play important roles in vitamin A metabolism in the developing embryo.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically, glucocorticoids are important immunosuppressive hormones. Yet, these steroids are also potent inhibitors of growth. We hypothesized that glucocorticoids may partially inhibit growth by increased somatostatin (SRIF) secretion. We tested this hypothesis using passive immunization techniques. Male rats (approximately 50 g) were treated daily (ip) for 33 days with saline (SAL) or dexamethasone (DEX, 40 micrograms/kg) and every fourth day with normal sheep serum (NSS) or SRIF antiserum (SRIF-ab, 0.25 ml). Body wts were recorded daily. Groups (n = 6) were: 1) SAL + NSS, 2) SAL + SRIF-ab, 3) DEX + NSS, and 4) DEX + SRIF-ab. Regression analysis of the growth curves clearly demonstrated differences in body wt gain for the four treatment groups (P less than 0.01). Final body wt of SAL + NSS treated rats was 285 +/- 5 g and 285 +/- 12 g in SAL + SRIF-ab treated rats. DEX + NSS treated rats weighed significantly less (227 +/- 4 g, P less than 0.01) than SAL-treated rats. This glucocorticoid-induced decrease in body wt was partially reversed by the concomitant treatment of rats with SRIF-ab (241 +/- 6 g, P less than 0.05). This observation leads to the conclusion that the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on growth may be mediated, in part, by increased SRIF secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the application of nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis for isolation of the catalytically active iodothyronine 5'-monodeiodinase (5'-MD) in rat liver microsomes. Preliminary studies showed that most ingredients of conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, including acrylamide, SDS, and bromophenol blue, markedly inhibited 5'-MD activity in solubilized rat liver microsomal proteins (SRLMP). We replaced these inhibitory components with those that had little or no inhibitory effect on the 5'-MD and devised conditions for nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis for isolation of a 5'-MD protein. SRLMP (up to 120 micrograms protein/well), prepared by preincubation with 5 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio 1-propanesulfonate] (CHAPS) and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.35% agarose gel in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 6.6 buffer containing 2 mM CHAPS and 1 mM thioglycolic acid. Electrophoresis was carried out for 14 h at 4 C using 2.5 V/cm. After phoresis, the gel was sliced into 16 fractions, and homogenates of each fraction were tested for 5'-MD activity by incubation with 0.6 nM [125I]rT3 for 30 min at 37 C in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol. The peak 5'-MD activity was detected in fraction 6 (Rf, 0.375). This fraction accounted for about 30% of total 5'-MD activity and only 6% of protein in the gel. The gel slice containing the peak 5'-MD activity was next subjected to a second electrophoresis at pH 7.6 for 4 h in a 90 degrees different direction. The most 5'-MD activity was demonstrated in the third of 8 gel fractions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this fraction demonstrated only one 55 K protein in most experiments and occasionally an additional 35 K protein. The specific activity of 5'-MD in this fraction of greater than 11 pmol I-/mg protein.h was at least 2.3-fold that in SRLMP. Rabbits were immunized with agarose gel containing the peak 5'-MD activity. Immunized rabbit immunoglobulin G bound up to 70% of 5'-MD activity in SRLMP, and the binding effect varied in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that the anti-5'-MD antibody bound only one 55 K protein among innumerable proteins in SRLMP. A specific antiprotein disulfide isomerase antibody bound a slightly larger, 57 K protein in SRLMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91065236\r", 
  ".W": "Vanadate has been documented to inhibit tyrosine phosphatase activity and to have insulin-mimetic effects. However, oral administration to hypoinsulinemic diabetic rats in vivo lowers blood glucose at serum concentrations of vanadate that have minimal insulin-like effects in vitro. We, therefore, investigated the effect of low concentrations of vanadate on insulin binding, processing, and action. Preincubation of rat adipocytes for 2 h at 37 C with 10-200 microM vanadate resulted in a dose-dependent increase in [125I]insulin binding at 37 C to a maximum of 45% above the control value. Total cell-associated radioactivity and internalized (acid-resistant) hormone were similarly increased. Binding studies at 15 C in the presence of potassium cyanide revealed that this effect was associated with an increase in insulin receptor affinity. Consistent with these results, vanadate affected binding at 37 C only at low concentrations of insulin. Preloading adipocytes for 8 min with 0.4 ng/ml [125I]insulin revealed that vanadate slowed the rate of release of internalized hormone (50% release; 9.0 min vs. 12.5 min). The proportion of [125I]insulin released in intact form (trichloroacetic acid precipitable) was significantly increased by vanadate up to 15 min. Preincubation of adipocytes with vanadate resulted in an apparent increased sensitivity, with a shift to the left in the dose-response curve of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis (ED50, 0.2 vs. 0.08 ng/ml). Furthermore, vanadate maintained maximum insulin-stimulated lipogenesis after extensive washing to remove insulin. These effects could not be accounted for by the insulin-mimetic effect of vanadate alone. We conclude that 1) low concentrations of vanadate (less than 200 microM) increase insulin receptor affinity and consequent insulin uptake in rat adipocytes; 2) the excess cell-associated insulin exists largely as intact hormone; and 3) the increased binding at low insulin concentrations results in an apparent increase in insulin sensitivity. Vanadate at low concentrations also prolongs insulin action. Whether tyrosine phosphatase inhibition is the basic biochemical mechanism remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the rapid effects (less than 120 sec) of 1,25(OH)2D3 on membrane phospholipid hydrolysis in porcine parathyroid cells and compared these effects to those produced by extracellular Ca2+. Cells were labeled with [3H]myo-inositol or [14C]arachidonic acid for 3 h, then exposed to various 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations in 0.5 mM Ca2+ for different time periods or to 2 mM [Ca2+]. Parathyroid cells showed a biphasic increase in diacylglycerol (DAG), monoacylglycerol (MG), phosphatidic acid (PA), and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-12)-10(-8) M) or to 2 mM [Ca2+]. This effect was rapid (within 5 sec) and dose-dependent, with a maximal stimulation with 10 pM of 1,25(OH)2D3. At this concentration, the first peak of DAG, MG, and IP3 was at 5 sec and reached 176 +/- 9%, 134 +/- 4%, and 154 +/- 13%, respectively vs. basal levels. For PA, the first maximum increase was at 20 sec (130 +/- 6%). At 30 sec MG, PA, and IP3 returned to basal levels, whereas the decrease in DAG was under the basal level (-25 +/- 5%). The second peak reached a maximum at 60 sec for the four products (145 +/- 8%, 119 +/- 5%, 125 +/- 6%, and 175 +/- 20%, respectively) then decreased to basal level at 120 sec. High extracellular Ca2+ (2 mM) and fluoride (5 mM) also produced similar increase in phosphatidylinositol metabolites, except that DAG levels returned to basal level at 30 sec. In conclusion, the present data shows the existence of rapid effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in porcine parathyroid cells. The short time sequence suggests that they are mediated by a direct interaction with the membrane, possibly through a receptor-mediated process linked to phospholipase C by a G-protein.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence shows that gonadal steroids exert a facilitatory influence on levels and release of neuropeptide-Y (NPY) from the hypothalamus. However, it is not known whether gonadal steroids act directly on NPY-producing cells in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus to produce these facilitatory effects on NPY or whether they act on other cells that have a modulatory influence via synapses on ARC NPY cells. We applied the combined method of steroid autoradiography and immunocytochemistry to assess the localization of [3H]estradiol in relation to NPY-producing cells in the hypothalamus. Rats (n = 6) were bilaterally ovariectomized and injected intracerebroventricularly with colchicine. Twenty-four hours later each rat received an iv injection of 17 beta-[2,4,6,7,16,17(-3)H]estradiol (SA, 166 Ci/mmol) at a dose of 5.0 micrograms/kg BW. One hour after the injection of [3H]estradiol, the rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde; brains were removed, frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen (-190 C), sectioned, and processed for autoradiography. The autoradiograms were then incubated with specific antibodies for NPY immunostaining by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. The results revealed NPY-immunopositive cells in the ARC, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral cortex and a few cells in the median eminence. NPY-immunoreactive fibers were also detected in the internal layer of the median eminence. The largest number of neurons showing NPY immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm was detected in the ARC, and only in this nucleus did we observed colocalization of [3H]estradiol and NPY immunoreactivity in neurons. A population of NPY-immunopositive cells in the ARC (10-20%) exhibited nuclear [3H]estradiol; the majority of these cells were located in the lateral and ventral portions of the ARC. Since gonadal steroids stimulate hypothalamic NPY levels and release, this anatomical evidence of colocalization is suggestive of a direct genomic modulation of NPY neurosecretion by steroids in a subpopulation of hypothalamic NPY-immunopositive neurons.\r"

  ".U": "91065241\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed an estrogen bioassay using the Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line growing in 96-well microtiter plates. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity (AlkP) in these cells is markedly stimulated by estrogens, and this enzyme can be easily quantified in situ using a chromogenic substrate. These cells are very sensitive to estrogens; estradiol induces AlkP at levels as low as 10(-12) M. Antiestrogens completely block the action of estradiol. Various estrogens stimulate AlkP with potencies comparable to those achieved in vivo. The induction of AlkP is specific for estrogens; no other type of steroid, including androgens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, or glucocorticoids produce this effect. The stimulation of AlkP in Ishikawa cells is specific for estrogens, is highly reproducible and sensitive, and permits large numbers of samples to be assayed with ease. We have used this assay to investigate the estrogenic action of the adrenal delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids. While pregnenolone is inactive, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate ester induce AlkP slightly. However, the C19 steroid, 5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol is considerably more estrogenic in this assay, although it stimulates Ishikawa AlkP with a potency of 1/30,000 that of estradiol. The stimulation by 5-androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol is inhibited by antiestrogens, but it is not blocked by the delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid isomerase/dehydrogenase inhibitor, cyanoketone, or by the aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxy-androstenedione. Thus, neither conversion to a delta 4-3-ketone nor aromatization is required for the action of this unusual estrogen.\r"

  ".U": "91065243\r", 
  ".W": "Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM; EC 1.14.17.3) is a granule-associated enzyme that catalyzes the production of alpha-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors, a posttranslational modification often required for full biological activity. PAM activity in crude homogenates of bovine neurointermediate pituitary has an acidic pH optimum for the peptide substrate alpha-N-Ac-Tyr-Val-Gly. During purification, the pH optimum shifts, so that purified bovine (b)PAM exhibits an alkaline pH optimum for this substrate with virtually no activity below pH 6.5. A factor that restores the ability of purified bPAM to produce alpha-amidated products at pH 6 was identified. In rat anterior pituitary this factor (denoted SPAM for stimulator of PAM activity) was a soluble protein with a mol wt of 44 K by gel filtration; its stimulatory activity could be reduced or eliminated by trypsin digestion or boiling. SPAM stimulated PAM activity at acidic pH by increasing the apparent Vmax and decreasing the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the peptide substrate. Like PAM, SPAM activity is localized to the secretory granule. Levels of SPAM activity in various rat tissues correlated closely with levels of PAM activity, with the greatest amount of SPAM activity in atrium, anterior pituitary, and neurointermediate pituitary. The distribution of PAM and SPAM between soluble and membrane fractions also correlated closely. In AtT-20 cell lines transfected with a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the full-length bPAM precursor, both SPAM and PAM activities were increased compared to wild type cells; both activities were decreased in a cell line expressing an antisense rat (r)PAM mRNA. In marked contrast, an AtT-20 cell line transfected with a cDNA encoding a truncated, soluble form of bPAM had elevated levels of PAM activity, but levels of SPAM activity were not increased compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that SPAM activity is closely linked to the expression of full-length PAM. The interaction of PAM and SPAM may represent a site for regulation of the synthesis of bioactive peptides, particularly at low intragranular pH.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) purified from bovine serum shares 19 of 25 amino-terminal amino acid residues with IGFBP-3 purified from human, rat, and porcine sources. A newly characterized bovine fibroblast model was used to investigate the biological effects of purified bovine IGFBP-3 (bIGFBP-3). Coincubation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) with increasing concentrations of bIGFBP-3 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated [3H]aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake in cultured bovine fibroblasts. Inhibition was complete at equimolar concentrations of IGF-I and bIGFBP-3. Inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated [3H]AIB uptake paralleled the ability of bIGFBP-3 to prevent [125I]IGF-I cell surface binding. In contrast, preincubation with bIGFBP-3 resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of IGF-I-stimulated [3H]AIB uptake; a 32-86% increase in IGF-I bioactivity was seen after a 24 h preexposure to 10 nM bIGFBP-3, and a 2- to 6-fold potentiation was seen after a 72 h preincubation. Preincubation with bIGFBP-3 increased both the sensitivity and maximal responsiveness of the cells to IGF-I. The potentiating effects of bIGFBP-3 were associated with increased [125I]IGF-I binding to cultured bovine fibroblasts. Affinity cross-linking experiments indicated that the increase in IGF-I binding was due to increased membrane-associated bIGFBP-3 rather than to a bIGFBP-3-induced increase in type I IGF receptors. bIGFBP-3 had no effect on insulin stimulation of [3H]AIB uptake under either experimental condition. These data suggest that soluble bIGFBP-3 inhibits IGF-I action by sequestering and preventing IGF-I receptor binding, whereas surface-associated bIGFBP-3 enhances the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I in bovine fibroblasts. We propose that IGFBP-3 serves a dual function in modulating IGF action in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "It is the aim of this study to establish ovarian transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) gene expression, to reevaluate its cellular localization, and to explore potential interactions of this regulatory peptide on ovarian androgen biosynthesis. Northern analysis of whole ovarian polyadenylated RNA revealed a single 2.5-kilobase transcript corresponding to the TGF beta 1 precursor. Immunohistochemical staining localized the protein to the thecal-interstitial (interfollicular) compartment. To explore potential autocrine effects of TGF beta 1, use was made of whole ovarian dispersates from immature rats the differentiation of which was monitored by the acquisition of androgen biosynthetic capacity. The accumulation of androsterone, the major androgenic steroid detectable in this culture system, increased 5.4-fold over baseline in response to treatment with hCG (1 ng/ml). This effect was further optimized (2- to 4-fold) by supplementation with insulin (1 microgram/ml) and insulin-like growth factor-I (50 ng/ml). In the absence of these optimizing supplements, TGF beta 1 (10 ng/ml) was without effect on basal androsterone accumulation, producing distinct, albeit relatively limited (25%), inhibition of hCG hormonal action. In contrast, supplement-mediated optimization of ovarian androgen biosynthesis revealed TGF beta 1 to be a highly potent inhibitor (greater than 80%) of hCG hormonal action. This reversible TGF beta 1 action proved time and dose dependent, with a minimal time requirement of 72 h and a median inhibitory dose of 2.6 ng/ml. TGF beta 1 action was not due to diminution in the viable cell mass or altered cAMP generation and, therefore, most likely involved a site(s) of action distal to or independent of cAMP generation. Cellular radiolabeling studies of TGF beta 1-treated ovarian cells disclosed the accumulation of steroid intermediates proximal to the 17 alpha-hydroxylation step, suggesting TGF beta 1-mediated blockade at the level of the steroidogenic enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17-20-lyase. Taken together, these observations are in keeping with the view that TGF beta 1, possibly of thecal-interstitial origin, may not only play a positive paracrine role at the level of the adjacent granulosa cell (as previously reported), but may also constitute one of several autocrine signals concerned with the regulation of ovarian androgen economy. As such, these findings reaffirm the polyfunctional nature of TGF beta 1 action, as manifested by its diametrically opposed effects in different ovarian compartments.\r"

  ".W": "Interaction between Sertoli cells and germ cells is likely to be critical for normal development of the testis. We have established and characterized cocultures of neonatal Sertoli cells and gonocytes and have begun to study the physical and functional relationship between these cells in vitro. Cells were isolated from rat pups by sequential enzymatic treatment and cultured in serum-free medium. When plated on Matrigel, Sertoli cells rapidly attach, and gonocytes adhere to the underlying Sertoli cells shortly thereafter. We observed that some of these germ cells develop cytoplasmic processes and elongate during the first day of culture, essentially mimicking their behavior in vivo. Electron microscopic examination of typical cultures revealed the presence of desmosome-like adhesion sites and apparent gap junctions between Sertoli cells and gonocytes. To determine whether Sertoli cells and gonocytes are functionally coupled in the cocultures, we used the glass bead-loading technique of McNeil and Warder to introduce Lucifer yellow (LY), a gap junction-permeant probe, and Rhodamine-dextran (RD), a larger marker excluded by gap junctions, simultaneously into cultures 24 h after plating. Immediate fixation and viewing of cultures with fluorescence microscopy indicated that all bead-loaded cells received both probes. We studied other living cultures 10 min after bead-loading and located RD-negative (i.e. nonbead-loaded) gonocytes that were in obvious contact with RD- and LY-positive bead-loaded Sertoli cells; these gonocytes were scored for the presence or absence of cytoplasmic LY. This analysis revealed that many gonocytes were able to obtain LY from adjacent Sertoli cells, presumably via gap junctions maintained with these cells. In addition, we quantified the percentage of gonocytes that elongated with increasing time in vitro and correlated the morphology of these cells with their ability to acquire LY from adjacent Sertoli cells. Our findings indicate that although the absolute numbers of gonocytes present decreases, more of those remaining elongate as time in vitro increases. We can also conclude from our data that gonocytes with and without processes are equally likely to be coupled with Sertoli cells under these conditions. These observations provide the first demonstration of functional coupling between Sertoli cells and premeiotic germ cells. Together with our morphological observations, they suggest that gap junction-mediated communication between these cells may be involved in stimulating or regulating changes in the gonocyte population during postnatal development of the testis.\r"

Media conditioned by cells from luteinized rat ovaries stimulated the directed migration of rabbit endothelial cells or mouse Balb/c3T3 cells, but was not mitogenic to either cell type. That endotheliotropic activity was not associated with a steroid was indicated by the finding that chemoattractant activity was detected in fractions after reversed-phase C18 chromatography, which removes more than 95% of steroids present in the media, and that chemoattractant activity was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and by ethanol. Full chemoattractant activity was recovered after boiling (95 C for 30 min), lyophilization, dialysis, Sephadex G-25 desalting columns, and pH changes from 3-10. After Sephadex G-200 chromatography, chemoattractant activity emerged at elution volumes corresponding to 20,000-30,000 mol wt. Chemoattractant activity was not retained by Concanavalin A-Sepharose or gelatin-Sepharose, and was only partially retained by heparin-agarose. Chemoattractant activity was also partially retained on both cation and anion exchange columns. Our collective findings indicate the presence of a nonsteroidal, heat-stable, pronase-sensitive factor, nominal mol wt of 20,000-30,000, in media conditioned by cells from luteinized rat ovaries; this factor is chemoattractive but not mitogenic to endothelial cells. Ovarian-derived chemoattractant activity appears to be distinct from fibroblast growth factor because it lacked detectable mitogenic activity, and because fibroblast growth factor was not active in our cell migration bioassay. Because stimulation of endothelial cell migration is a key event during angiogenesis, demonstration of an ovarian endotheliotropic chemoattractant is consistent with our hypothesis that angiogenesis factors play a role in the paracrine regulation of ovarian function.\r"

  ".W": "Fibroblasts represent one of the in vivo sites of extrahepatic insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) production. In this study, cultured fibroblasts prepared from the skin of neonatal rats were used as a model to assess the role of serum in regulating IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. IGF-I mRNA, as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, was present in the cultured fibroblasts, and serum free media which was conditioned by fibroblasts for 20 h contained 108 pg/ml of immunoreactive IGF-I. Fetal calf serum (FCS) decreased steady state IGF-I mRNA levels, as measured by solution hybridization/RNase protection assay, in fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Incubation of fibroblasts for 18 h in the presence of 0.3%, 0.6%, or 1% FCS decreased IGF-I mRNA levels to 76%, 56%, and 46% of the levels present in control cells which were maintained in serum free media with 0.25% BSA. Maximal inhibition to approximately 20% of control levels was seen with 4-10% FCS. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth factor and beta-actin mRNA levels increased 2- and 4-fold, respectively, with increasing concentrations of FCS. Treatment of the cells with 10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide resulted in partial abrogation of the inhibitory effect of FCS while protein synthesis in the cells was decreased to 6% of control levels. The addition of 2 micrograms/ml of insulin or 15-100 ng/ml of IGF-I to the fibroblasts did not reproduce the inhibitory effect of FCS. Finally, the inhibitory factor(s) present in the FCS was partially removed/inactivated by charcoal stripping or heat inactivating the serum, but delipidation of the FCS by chloroform extraction had no effect on the inhibitory effect of FCS. In summary, FCS contains a factor(s) that decreases IGF-I mRNA levels in cultured fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The partial abrogation of the inhibitory effect of FCS with cycloheximide treatment suggests that this effect is at least partially dependent upon new protein synthesis. Furthermore, the studies using delipidated, heat-inactivated, and charcoal-stripped serum suggest that the inhibitory factor(s) is a peptide.\r"

Dexamethasone (DEX, 700 micrograms) (n = 6) or cholesterol (CHOL, 700 micrograms) (n = 5) implants were placed bilaterally 2 mm lateral to PVN of fetal sheep at 108 to 111 days of gestation (dga). After 5 days recovery, fetuses were challenged with: 1) hypotension (50% drop of blood pressure), 2) hypoxemia (fall of greater than 5 mm Hg in fetal PaO2), and 3) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (10 micrograms iv, single injection to fetus). Hypotension and hypoxemia were repeated after 125 dga. Compared with CHOL, DEX fetuses had lower average concentrations of ACTH in plasma after hypotension [23 +/- 0.5 vs. 149 +/- 83.8 and 31 +/- 13.1 vs. 101 +/- 31.3 pg ml-1 at less than 125 and more than 125 dga, respectively (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05)] and during hypoxemia [11 +/- 1.6 vs. 292 +/- 152.8 and 33 +/- 9.4 vs. 304 +/- 91.3 pg ml-1 at less than 125 and more than 125 dga, respectively (P less than 0.05)]. DEX and CHOL responses to CRH at 122 to 127 dga (10 micrograms iv) were not different (38 +/- 23.9 vs. 92 +/- 26.7 pg ml-1, respectively). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that CRH was decreased in PVN and eliminated from median eminence in DEX, but not in CHOL fetuses. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunostaining of PVN of DEX and CHOL fetuses was similar; however, unlike CHOL, DEX fetuses showed no AVP immunostaining of the external zone of median eminence. These results show that, in fetal sheep, high concentrations of glucocorticoid near the fetal PVN prevent increases in plasma ACTH secretion seen in controls in response to hypotension and hypoxemia, and exert at least part of their effect at the level of the CRH- and AVP-producing neurons located in the PVN.\r"

  ".W": "The 9 kilodalton vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP9k), calbindin-D9k, is expressed in the intestine and uterus of mammals. Rat intestinal CaBP9k is a well documented expression of the steroid hormone like action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). In contrast exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 does not affect the concentration of uterine CaBP9k which is dependent on estrogen. We have analyzed the effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the regulation of CaBP9k gene expression in the uterus of mature ovariectomized rats. CaBP9k mRNA is undetectable in the uterus of mature ovariectomized rats. A single dose of 17 beta-estradiol results in a detectable level of CaBP9k mRNA at 1 h and a significant increase 3 h after injection. The maximal CaBP9k mRNA level is reached 6 to 12 h post injection. These results show that 17 beta-estradiol increases CaBP9k production by increasing CaBP9k gene transcription. Chronic 17 beta-estradiol administration results in a plateau of CaBP9k mRNA but in a large increase in CaBP9k concentration. The kinetic response to a single estradiol injection was similar in immature rats. This result shows that no cellular differentiation is required for the control of CaBP9k gene expression by 17 beta-estradiol. The uterine cells of immature rats are already competent to respond optimally to estradiol. There is a single 0.5 kilobase CaBP9k gene transcript in the rat duodenum. In contrast there are two estrogen-inducible CaBP9k mRNA species in the uterus of both the mature ovariectomized and the immature rats. The smallest species corresponds to the duodenal CaBP9k mRNA species, while the larger species is at least 50 nucleotides larger. However, a unique CaBP9k identical to that in the duodenum is expressed in the uterus.\r"

  ".U": "91065259\r", 
  ".W": "Adipsin is a serine protease with complement factor D activity that is synthesized by adipocytes and secreted into the blood stream. Expression of adipsin is deficient in models of genetic (ob/ob, db/db) and acquired (monosodium glutamate-lesioned) obesity, but the cellular mechanisms responsible for this deficiency are unknown. Because hyperinsulinemia is frequently associated with obesity, we evaluated the effects of this hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on adipsin secretion and adipsin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. In the present study, we report that in fully differentiated adipocytes (after 11 days post confluence), insulin exposure progressively decreases adipsin secretion by 40%, 67%, and 78% after 2, 4, and 6 days of treatment. The inhibition of adipsin secretion by insulin is the result of a corresponding decrease in adipsin mRNA and is specific since two other differentiation-dependent fat cell mRNAs encoding aP2 (a fatty acid binding protein) and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), are unaffected. Insulin suppresses adipsin gene expression via high affinity insulin receptors, because physiological levels of insulin produce this effect, and dose-response curves for insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glucose utilization are similar to insulin's effect on adipsin. In contrast, insulin when present during days 1-8 post confluence (during differentiation) markedly increases adipsin secretion and adipsin mRNA levels. This stimulation is due to the ability of insulin to accelerate differentiation as evidenced by corresponding increases in aP2 and GPD mRNAs as well. Insulin and IGF-1 are equipotent in this effect, suggesting that both insulin and IGF-1 receptors can mediate this response. In summary, during the differentiation of 3T3-F442A adipocytes, insulin stimulates adipsin gene expression by accelerating differentiation. As the cells become mature adipocytes, they acquire some differentiation-dependent factor, which couples insulin receptor stimulation to inhibition of adipsin gene expression. This model should aid our search for the molecular links between insulin receptor stimulation and altered gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal regulation of thecal cell function was investigated with cells isolated at various stages of antral follicle development. Bovine thecal cells were isolated from small antral, medium antral, and large Graffian follicles (small, medium, and large ovarian follicles). Serum-free cultures of thecal cells were established and viable for a minimum of 6-8 days of culture. The purity of the thecal cell population was characterized cytochemically and was found to contain less than 5% endothelial cell and/or granulosa cell contamination. The steroidogenic capacity of this purified population of thecal cells in serum-free culture was examined through an analysis of androgen and progesterone production. Androgen production was high during the first 3 days of culture, then declined to undetectable levels. Production of androstenedione was approximately 10-fold higher than production of testosterone. Progesterone production remained relatively constant throughout the 8-day culture period. hCG was found to stimulate androgen production during days 1-3 of culture, but had a negligible effect on progesterone production. In contrast, hCG stimulated progesterone production during days 3-6 of culture, but had a negligible effect on androgen production. Insulin stimulated progesterone production during days 3-6 of culture, but had no effect on androgen or progesterone production during days 1-3 of culture. The minimum effective concentrations of hCG and insulin required to stimulate steroidogenesis of the thecal cells ranged from approximately 1-10 ng/ml. Addition of serum to the cultures decreased androgen production and suppressed the hormone responsiveness of the cells. Thecal cells in culture appear to alter their steroidogenic capacity from an androgen-producing cell to a progesterone-producing cell. Analysis of the developmental regulation of thecal cell function revealed that androgen production and hormone responsiveness were relatively constant in small, medium, and large follicles. In contrast, progesterone production and hormone responsiveness were highest in small follicles, intermediate in medium follicles, and lowest in large follicles. A more general analysis of the developmental regulation of thecal cell function examined the secretion of radiolabeled proteins. A large number of radiolabeled proteins were secreted by thecal cells, ranging in molecular mass from 5-500 kDa. Interestingly, insulin and hCG had no major effect on secretion of proteins by cells isolated from any of the stages of development examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen regulation of thecal cell steroidogenesis and differentiation was investigated with cells from ovarian antral follicles. Bovine theca interna cells were isolated and cultured in serum-free conditions to evaluate the effects of estradiol on thecal cell production of androstenedione, testosterone, and progesterone. Estradiol increased thecal cell androgen production throughout a 6-day culture period; however, the basal and stimulated levels of androgen production diminished after day 3 of culture. Androstenedione accumulation was approximately 10-fold greater than that of testosterone. In contrast to the stimulatory effects that estradiol had on androgen production, estradiol suppressed progesterone production throughout the 6-day culture period. Comparison of the effects of estradiol and hCG on thecal cells from small (less than 5 mm), medium (5-10 mm), and large (greater than 10 mm) antral follicles demonstrated that estradiol stimulated androgen production to a greater extent than hCG with cells from all of these stages of follicle development. Estradiol stimulation of androstenedione was greater in theca from small follicles than in theca from medium or large follicles. In contrast, suppressive effects of estradiol on progesterone were most apparent on thecal cells from medium and large follicles and less apparent on theca from small follicles. Estradiol stimulated androstenedione production in a dose-dependent fashion, with a minimum effective concentration of 10(-9) M and a maximum effective concentration of 10(-7)-10(-6) M. Concentrations greater than 10(-6) M estradiol resulted in a decline in the stimulatory response and may be important in the preovulatory follicle to suppress thecal cell androgen production and initiate the process of luteinization. Progesterone production was slightly stimulated by 10(-9) M estradiol, whereas higher concentrations (10(-7)-5 x 10(-6) M) resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of progesterone production. Interestingly, combined treatment of thecal cells with estradiol and hCG resulted in a greater than additive stimulation of androstenedione production, and estradiol decreased the ability of hCG to stimulate progesterone production. Observations demonstrate that estradiol can dramatically alter thecal cell production of steroids and support a hypothesis that steroid-mediated interactions between granulosa and thecal cells play an important role in regulating cellular function within follicles. The data provide evidence that a local feedback loop may exist in ovarian follicles, where androgens produced by thecal cells are used as a substrate for granulosa cell aromatization into estrogens, which, in turn, may feed back to stimulate thecal cell production of androgens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that often induces thyroid disorders. Its effects on several aspects of thyroid function were studied using cultured dog thyroid cells. Within 5-60 min of incubation of cell membranes with amiodarone, there were profound changes in adenylate cyclase activity and TSH receptor binding. Amiodarone specifically decreased TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but not the basal or forskolin-stimulated activities, while it increased the binding of 125I-labeled TSH to its receptors. Significant effects were seen with 5-10 microM amiodarone, with maximal effects at 50-100 microM, when TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was completely blocked and the labeled TSH binding increased 4- to 5-fold over control. These effects of amiodarone were reversible, since membranes exposed to 50 microM amiodarone for 1 h exhibited normal binding and cyclase activities, when amiodarone was removed by washing before the assay. The above effects of amiodarone were also observed when cells, instead of membranes, were treated with the drug, although the magnitude of changes was less than in membranes. Lower concentrations of amiodarone (10-25 microM) caused significant inhibition of iodide organification, without affecting iodide uptake, while higher concentrations (50-100 microM) inhibited organification by nearly 75% and uptake by about 20%. Amiodarone (10-100 microM) also inhibited [3H]2-deoxy-glucose uptake and the increase in intracellular calcium concentration in response to TSH and carbachol. In contrast to membranes, treatment of cells with amiodarone caused persistent inhibition of TSH-stimulated cAMP formation and iodide organification even 24-48 h after removal of the drug. However, amiodarone had no effect on cell viability, as judged by trypan blue exclusion and ability to remain attached to the culture dishes. These results suggest that amiodarone has specific inhibitory effects on agonist-stimulated functions in thyroid cells, possibly by interfering with TSH-receptor interactions and also at the level of cholinergic receptors.\r"

In addition, the expression of the inhibin alpha- and beta-subunits (beta A and beta B) in these tissues was evaluated by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. Testicular concentrations of inhibin bioactivity and immunoactivity increased 2.5-fold (103 +/- 24.5 to 256 +/- 11.7 U/g wet weight; mean +/- SE) and 10.4-fold (139 +/- 56 to 1430 +/- 172) respectively, between 90 days and term. The corresponding ratio of inhibin biological: immunological activities (B/I ratio) decreased 8.3-fold (1.5 +/- 0.7 to 0.18 +/- 0.01). The concentration of ovarian bioactive inhibin increased significantly (P less than 0.05) 4.6-fold between 90 days and term (73.6 +/- 14.7 to 340 +/- 11.1 U/g wet weight), whereas the immunoactive inhibin concentration increased 10.3-fold between 120 and 210 days of gestation (7.2 +/- 1.9 to 40.0 +/- 8.7). The corresponding B/I ratio remained unchanged throughout gestation (8.3 +/- 2.4 to 12.5 +/- 4.0). Although the levels of alpha subunit mRNA in the testis and ovary increased over gestation, the levels of testicular beta A subunit mRNA remained low and unchanged. Ovarian levels of beta A subunit mRNA were also low but variable. Furthermore, no beta B subunit mRNA could be detected in gonadal tissue throughout gestation. alpha-Subunit mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the sex cords of the fetal testis and the granulosa cells of the fetal ovary while beta A subunit mRNA was detected only in the granulosa cells of the fetal ovary. It is concluded that inhibin is produced by the fetal testis and ovary and these tissue levels increase throughout gestation. The location of alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA to the sex cords of the testis and granulosa cells of the ovary indicate that these cells are the primary source of inhibin production. The rapid fall in inhibin B/I ratio in testicular extracts over gestation is attributed to the production of an inhibin-related protein with limited or negligible biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single injection of LH on rat Leydig cell peroxisome volume and peroxisomal sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2) content. Sexually mature Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5) were injected sc with 500 micrograms LH and euthanized, and trunk blood was collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h. Additionally, LH-treated rats were whole body perfused-fixed, and their testes were processed for qualitative and quantitative histochemical and immunocytochemical studies at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Peroxisomes were identified by cytochemical staining for catalase activity with the alkaline 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride method. Catalase and SCP2 were immunolocalized in Leydig cell organelles via 10-nm AuroProbe EM protein-A gold particles. Peak plasma testosterone concentrations were observed 1 and 2 h after the single sc LH injection. The average volume of a Leydig cell was unchanged by the LH treatment at all time points tested. Similarly, the absolute volumes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria per Leydig cell were unchanged at all time points tested. By contrast, the absolute volume of peroxisomes per Leydig cell increased 3-fold 0.5 h after LH injection (P less than 0.01) and then returned to control values by 2 h. The absolute volume of negative bodies (single membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles lacking catalase) per Leydig cell was elevated above the control value 0.5 and 1 h after LH injection. Western blot analysis demonstrated a single protein at 14 and 60 kDa with anti-SCP2 and anticatalase, respectively, for both homogenates obtained from liver and purified Leydig cells. Quantitative immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the gold particle density representing SCP2 over peroxisomes increased 5-fold 0.5 h after the LH injection (P less than 0.01) and then returned to control values by 2 h. In contrast, the gold particle density representing catalase over peroxisomes was not different in control and LH-injected groups. We conclude that a single sc injection of LH causes a rapid, specific, and transient increase in both the volume of peroxisomes and the peroxisomal content of SCP2 in Leydig cells.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of transforming growth factor B1 (TGF beta 1) to inhibit proliferation and activate death of rat ventral prostatic glandular cells was tested both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo administration of 50 ng TGF beta 1/day directly to the regressed ventral prostate of previously castrated male rats had no effect on the proliferative regrowth of the prostatic glandular cells induced by exogeneous androgen replacement. In addition, androgen-stimulated ventral prostatic cell proliferation in vitro in organ culture was not affected by exposure to 0.1-20 ng/ml TGF beta 1. In contrast in vivo administration of 50 ng TGF beta 1/day directly to the ventral prostate of intact noncastrated male rats resulted in the death of about 25% of the prostatic glandular cells within 7 days of treatment. Such TGF beta 1 treatment did not lower serum testosterone, nor did it affect the size or DNA content of the seminal vesicles, demonstrating the local nature of the response. Likewise, in androgen-maintained ventral prostate organ cultures in vitro, there was a dose-response relationship between glandular cell death and TGF beta 1 concentration in the medium. These results demonstrate that TGF beta 1 can induce the death of androgen-dependent prostatic glandular cells even when physiological levels of androgen are present. Previous studies have demonstrated that both the receptor and the mRNA for TGF beta 1 increase rapidly in the ventral prostate after castration. Taken with the present data, these results suggest that TGF beta 1 may be a physiological intermediate in the programmed cell death of rat prostatic glandular cells activated after androgen ablation.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution and density of selectively labeled mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid binding sites were examined by in vitro radioautography in the hypothalamus of normal, estradiol valerate (EV)-injected, and estradiol (E2)-implanted female rats. Hypothalamic beta-endorphin concentration was also examined by RIA in these three groups of animals. Quantitative analysis of film radioautographs demonstrated a selective increase in mu-opioid binding in the medial preoptic area of EV-treated, but not of E2-implanted rats. However, both these estrogenized groups exhibited a reduction in the density of delta-opioid binding in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Statistically significant changes between either estrogenized groups were not observed for kappa-opioid binding. Results on the hypothalamic concentration of beta-endorphin indicated a marked reduction in EV-injected animals with respect to controls. In contrast, the E2-implanted animals exhibited beta-endorphin concentrations similar to controls. The present results confirm the increase in opioid receptor binding previously reported in the hypothalamus of EV-treated rats and further demonstrate that this increase is confined to the medial preoptic area and exclusively concerns mu-opioid receptors. The concomitant reduction in beta-endorphin levels observed in the same group of animals suggests that the observed increase in mu-opioid binding could reflect a chronic up-regulation of the receptor in response to compromised beta-endorphin input. Given the restriction of this effect to the site of origin of LHRH neurons and the demonstrated inhibitory role of opioids on LHRH release, it is tempting to postulate that such up-regulation could lead to the suppression of the plasma LH pattern that characterizes polycystic ovarian disease in the EV-treated rat.\r"

All of these antihuman monoclonal antibodies were tested for cross-reactivity with alpha-subunits derived from bovine, porcine, equine, bull frog, sea turtle, turkey, and ostrich glycoprotein hormones. All showed cross-reactivity with affinities ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-8) depending upon the antibody and the species of alpha-subunit. Cyanogen bromide fragments of bovine and equine alpha, when tested with selected antibodies indicated that antigenic determinants could be localized in two regions: alpha 9-33 and alpha 76-92. Comparison of amino acid sequences, and relative potencies, suggest that major antigenic determinants involve residues 21, 22, and 23 (F-F-S in human alpha) and 76-85 (G-G-F-K-V-E-N-H-T-A in human alpha). As part of this study the N-terminal amino acid sequences of bull frog, sea turtle, turkey, and ostrich alpha-subunits were determined and reported for the first time.\r"

Vasopressin gene transcription was not detected in human testis and corpus luteum and was found only once in four different experiments in baboon corpus luteum. Evidence for oxytocin gene transcription in the human testis was found in three of five experiments. The method employed and subsequent sequence analysis of the polymerase products verified the presence of oxytocin mRNA with normal hypothalamic-type exonic structure in primate corpus luteum. Nevertheless, the very low levels of mRNA present are unlikely to support other than local functions for the encoded nonapeptide hormones.\r"

  ".U": "91065271\r", 
  ".W": "Adrenal steroids have been shown to accelerate both spontaneous and thyroid hormone (TH)-induced metamorphosis. The present study is concerned with the mechanisms underlying this effect. Premetamorphic Rana catesbeiana tadpoles were immersed in water containing 1-20 nM T4 or T3 +/- 1 microM corticosterone (B) for 6 to 19 days. B is the predominant glucocorticoid in tadpole plasma before climax. As indicated by the rate of tail resorption and hepatic carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) activity, metamorphosis was significantly accelerated when TH-treated animals also received B: after 14 days in T4 (20 nM), tadpole tail length was decreased by 10%; in T4 + B, the decrease was 19%. At the same time, CPS activity was increased approximately 12-fold in tadpoles in T4 and 18-fold in those in T4 + B. Comparable results were obtained when T3 was employed. Neither tail resorption nor CPS activity was influenced by B alone. Plasma T4 levels attained at all bath concentrations of T4 were increased more than 2-fold when B was present. The same was true when T3 was used. In addition, in tadpoles immersed in 20 nM T4, the plasma T3 level-was significantly increased in the presence of B. Assessment of 5'-deiodinase and 5-deiodinase activities in vitro revealed that administration of B for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in 5'-deiodinase activity in skin and a significant reduction in T3 5-deiodinase activity in both liver and gut. Treatment with B reduced the rate of turnover of T3; 72 h after injection of 0.01 nmol [125I]T3, B-treated tadpoles had retained approximately 58% of the dose vs. 42% in controls. T3 nuclear receptor number (sites per nucleus) as assessed by an in vitro saturation technique was not altered in liver, tail, or red blood cells after 14 days of exposure to B. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that the acceleration of TH-induced metamorphosis by B is due at least in part to its ability to increase the plasma level of T4 or T3 through its effects on the peripheral metabolism of TH.

In the present study gene expression of 11-HSD was characterized in various tissues of the rat by use of a complementary DNA probe coding for the rat liver 11-HSD. In the liver, lung, testis, colon, heart, hippocampus, and kidney papilla a single message was observed of length approximately 1700 nucleotides (nt). In the kidney cortex/medulla, however, messenger RNA (mRNA) species were observed at 1900 nt, 1600 nt and 1500 nt, and deadenylation studies showed that the renal 1900 nt species was heterogeneous. Northern blot analysis of 11-HSD mRNA showed low levels of expression in the kidney of the neonate and much higher levels in liver and lung with expression increasing markedly in all three tissues over development. In mature rats, a low salt diet significantly elevated 11-HSD mRNA in the liver but not in other tissues. We interpret these data as evidence for the existence of a family of 11-HSD genes, and consistent with the possibility that the hepatic species may modulate occupancy of type II (classical) glucocorticoid rather than type I receptors.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the hypothesis that the LHRH neurosecretory system of the prepubertal female monkey has the capacity to function in a manner comparable to that of monkeys in more mature stages of development was tested. Using push-pull perfusion in the stalk-median eminence, effects of electrical stimulation of the medial basal hypothalamus on in vivo LHRH release were determined in conscious prepubertal, early pubertal, and midpubertal monkeys. After a 180-min period of baseline sample collection, electrical stimulation was applied six times at 90-min intervals via a monopolar electrode, the tip of which was 1-2 mm rostro-dorsal to the perfusion site. Control experiments were performed in the same manner, but without electrical stimulation. During control perfusions, the mean LHRH level remained stable. Mean (+/- SEM) LHRH release for the entire perfusion period in control experiments was 0.5 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.4, and 2.2 +/- 0.7 pg/ml.10 min for the prepubertal (n = 6), early pubertal (n = 4), and midpubertal (n = 6) groups, respectively. Mean LHRH release in the prepubertal group was significantly lower than that in either of the older groups (P less than 0.05). In contrast, in all three age groups, repeated electrical stimulation of the medial basal hypothalamus resulted in 1) a short latency increase in LHRH release occurring within 20 min after each stimulation, and/or 2) a gradual increase in mean LHRH release over several hours. In the prepubertal group (n = 4), mean LHRH levels were 0.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml.10 min during the 90 min before the first electrical stimulation and increased to 6.1 +/- 2.9 pg/ml.10 min during the 90 min after the sixth stimulation. This degree of responsiveness was similar to that of the older age groups. Mean LHRH levels before stimulation were 1.3 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 1.1 pg/ml.10 min in the early pubertal (n = 5) and midpubertal (n = 5) groups, respectively, and increased to 7.8 +/- 3.5 and 6.0 +/- 1.8 pg/ml.10 min, respectively, after the sixth stimulation. These increases in LHRH concentration with electrical stimulation were significant for all three age groups (P less than 0.03-0.001), while there were no significant differences between age groups. The temporal patterns of these responses suggest that electrical stimulation elicits LHRH release with a similar magnitude in all three age groups by 1) depolarizing LHRH neurons directly, and/or 2) stimulating multineuronal systems that synapse with LHRH neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on cytosolic calcium homeostasis was studied in suspensions of ovine large or small luteal cells from superovulated ewes. In large cells loaded with fura-2 (AM), resting cytosolic-free calcium ([Ca2+]i) was 62 +/- 5 nM (Hanks' medium, pH 7.15), and PGF2 alpha (0.5 microM) induced a rapid transient increase in [Ca2+]i to 152 +/- 6 nM, which then decreased to 97 +/- 6 nM within 3 min and remained at this level for the remainder of the treatment period (10-20 min). PGF2 alpha did not alter intracellular pH (pHi) in cells loaded with snarf-1 (AM) (pHi indicator). The transient nature of the [Ca2+]i increase was due, at least in part, to the ability of PGF2 alpha to stimulate (P less than 0.05) 45Ca2+ efflux. In small cells, resting [Ca2+]i was 57 +/- 5 nM, and no change in [Ca2+]i levels or pHi occurred with the addition of PGF2 alpha. PGF2 alpha also did not affect 45Ca2+ efflux in small cells. Calcium uptake was not significantly altered by PGF2 alpha in large or small cells. Data from kinetic analysis of the calcium transient was best fit to a two-compartment model consisting of a rapidly effluxing compartment and a slowly effluxing compartment. The size and rate constants were 62 +/- 10 nM and 3.6 +/- 1 min-1, respectively, for the rapidly effluxing compartment and 140 +/- 9 nM and 0.02 +/- 0.002 min-1, respectively, for the slowly effluxing compartment. These results provide evidence for a direct effect of PGF2 alpha specifically on the ovine large luteal cell that involves alterations in [Ca2+]i and calcium flux. This effect is likely to be involved in intracellular mediation of the signal for luteal regression.\r"

  ".W": "Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.19.-), a membrane-bound metalloproteinase, is a highly specific TRH-degrading enzyme. Exposure of Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells to 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) decreased the activity of this enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 5 x 10(-9) M). After 15 min of TPA treatment, only 10% of pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity remained. TPA treatment did not affect the activity of the cytosolic enzyme pyroglutamyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.19.3) or the membrane-bound enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.19.3). Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitors H-7 or sphingosine prevented the inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II by TPA. The time course of the TPA-mediated effect paralleled the time course of translocation and activation of protein kinase C in this cell line. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II was not due to dissociation or internalization of this enzyme molecule. Incubation of TPA-activated Y-79 cell membranes with gamma-[32P]-ATP followed by immunoprecipitation revealed a time-dependent phosphorylation of a 48 kilodalton subunit of pyroglutamyl peptidase II. These studies indicate that the phorbol ester effect is mediated by protein kinase C, and reveal a mechanism of potentiation of the action of TRH at its target sites.\r"

  ".W": "Food deprivation during pregnancy leads to an increase in maternal and fetal prostaglandin (PG) production and increased uterine contractility. We investigated the effect of maintaining fetal normoglycemia during food withdrawal-induced maternal hypoglycemia on uterine 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGFM) production and myometrial activity in late pregnant sheep. Pregnant sheep were surgically instrumented with fetal and maternal catheters and electromyogram leads under halothane anesthesia. Maternal and fetal blood plasma samples were obtained once a day at 0900 h, 24 h before (baseline sample) and after 48 h of food withdrawal. Food, but not water, was withdrawn from ewes in group I (n = 5). During food withdrawal in group II (n = 5), glucose was infused into a fetal vein to maintain fetal normoglycemia. All data were normalized to the concentration in the baseline sample in each animal as 100%. After 48 h of food withdrawal, maternal whole blood glucose fell by 42.2 +/- 4.4% (mean +/- SEM: group I) and 31.4 +/- 6.2% (group II). These values were not significantly different. Fetal blood glucose fell by 40.4 +/- 5.7% (group I). In group II, fetal blood glucose was maintained in the normal range (99.6 +/- 1.6% of baseline). Maternal uterine electromyogram activity, uterine venous estrone sulfate, and uterine veno-arterial difference in PGFM rose significantly during food withdrawal in group I ewes, but not in group II ewes. Maternal and fetal arterial plasma ACTH and cortisol did not change in group II animals. We conclude that maintenance of fetal normoglycemia during 48 h of food withdrawal in sheep prevents the increase in myometrial activity, maternal plasma estrogens, and uterine PGFM production during food withdrawal in late pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Several cultured human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC-4, SCC-12B2, SCC-12F2, EC-GI-10, and BEN) and one normal keratinocyte line (Epy-1) were investigated for the production of bone resorption-stimulating activity (BRSA). Conditioned medium (CM) from each of the six cell lines stimulated bone resorption in neonatal mouse calvariae in culture. The BRSA of SCC-12F2 and EC-GI-10 was inhibited completely by antibody to interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), whereas the BRSA in CM from the BEN, SCC-4, SCC-12B2, and Epy-1 cell lines was only partially inhibited by anti-IL-1 alpha. Addition of indomethacin to the calvarial cultures also partially inhibited the BRSA from EC-GI-10, SCC-4, SCC-12B2, and Epy-1 cells; the BRSA from BEN and SCC-12F2 cells was inhibited completely by indomethacin. cAMP production by calvariae was determined after a 60-min incubation with CM. CM from EC-GI-10, BEN, SCC-4, and Epy-1 stimulated cAMP production by bone. Preincubation of CM from BEN, EC-GI-10, SCC-4, and Epy-1 cells with two antisera against PTH-related protein [PTHrP; one specific for two PTHrP-(1-141), the other recognizing both PTHrP-(1-40) and PTHrP-(1-141)] completely inhibited the cAMP-stimulating activity. Using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha was measured in CM of the SCC-4, SCC-12B2, SCC-12F2, and Epy-1 cell lines. IL-1 beta was undetectable (less than 0.1 ng/ml) in CM from all cell lines. Our findings indicate that the BRSA secreted by SCC-12F2 cells can be accounted for largely or entirely by IL-1 alpha, while the activity produced by SCC-12B2 includes IL-1 alpha and another unknown factor(s). The BRSA produced by EC-GI-10, BEN, SCC-4, and Epy-1 cells includes both IL-1 alpha and PTHrP. We conclude that IL-1 alpha may be a more prevalent and biologically significant component of the BRSA produced by SCCs than previously recognized.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has a variety of effects in brain, including induction of fever, alteration of slow wave sleep, and alteration of neuroendocrine activity. To examine the potential sites of action of IL-1 in brain, we used iodine-125-labeled recombinant human interleukin-1 [( 125I]IL-1) to identify and characterize IL-1 receptors in crude membrane preparations of mouse (C57BL/6) hippocampus and to study the distribution of IL-1-binding sites in brain using autoradiography. In preliminary homogenate binding and autoradiographic studies, [125I]IL-1 alpha showed significantly higher specific binding than [125I]IL-1 beta. Thus, [125I]IL-1 alpha was used in all subsequent assays. The binding of [125I]IL-1 alpha was linear over a broad range of membrane protein concentrations, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant value of 114 +/- 35 pM and a maximum number of binding sites of 2.5 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein. In competition studies, recombinant human IL-1 alpha, recombinant human IL-1 beta, and a weak IL-1 beta analog. IL-1 beta +, inhibited [125I]IL-1 alpha binding to mouse hippocampus in parallel with their relative bioactivities in the T-cell comitogenesis assay, with inhibitory binding affinity constants of 55 +/- 18, 76 +/- 20, and 2940 +/- 742 pM, respectively; rat/human CRF and human tumor necrosis factor showed no effect on [125I]IL-1 alpha binding. Autoradiographic localization studies revealed very low densities of [125I]IL-1 alpha-binding sites throughout the brain, with highest densities present in the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the choroid plexus. Quinolinic acid lesion studies demonstrated that the [125I]IL-1 alpha-binding sites in the hippocampus were localized to intrinsic neurons. After hypophysectomy, homogenate binding and autoradiographic studies showed that there was no apparent change in the relative density of IL-1 receptors in the hippocampus. The identification of IL-1 receptors in brain with characteristics similar to IL-1 receptors in immune and neuroendocrine tissues provides further support for a physiological role for IL-1 to regulate central nervous system activity.\r"

  ".W": "GH secretion is markedly blunted in obesity; however, the mechanism(s) mediating this response remains to be elucidated. In the present study we examined the involvement of the two hypothalamic GH-regulatory hormones, GH-releasing factor (GRF) and somatostatin (SRIF), using the genetically obese male Zucker rat. Spontaneous GH, insulin, and glucose secretory profiles obtained from free moving, chronically cannulated rats revealed a marked suppression in amplitude and duration of GH pulses in obese Zucker rats compared to their lean littermates (mean 6-h plasma GH level, 3.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 21.5 +/- 3.8 ng/ml; P less than 0.001). Obese rats also exhibited significant hyperinsulinemia in the presence of normoglycemia. The plasma GH response to an iv bolus of 1 microgram rat GRF-(1-29)NH2, administered during peak and trough periods of the GH rhythm, was significantly attenuated in obese rats at peak (137.4 +/- 26.1 vs. 266.9 +/- 40.7 ng/ml; P less than 0.02), although not at trough, times. Passive immunization of obese rats with a specific antiserum to SRIF failed to restore the amplitude of GH pulses to normal values; the mean 6-h plasma GH level of obese rats given SRIF antiserum was not significantly different from that of obese rats administered normal sheep serum. Both pituitary wet weight and pituitary GH content and concentration were reduced in the obese group. Measurement of hypothalamic GRF immunoreactivity revealed a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in the mediobasal hypothalamic GRF content in obese rats (503.2 +/- 60.1 pg/fragment) compared to that in lean controls (678.1 +/- 50.2 pg/fragment), although no significant difference was observed in hypothalamic SRIF concentration. Peripheral SRIF immunoreactive levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated in both the pancreas and stomach of obese rats. These results demonstrate that the genetically obese Zucker rat exhibits 1) marked impairment in both spontaneous and GRF-induced GH release, which cannot be reversed by SRIF immunoneutralization, 2) significant reduction in pituitary GH concentration, 3) depressed hypothalamic GRF content, and 4) elevated gastric and pancreatic, but not hypothalamic, SRIF levels. The findings suggest that the defect in pituitary GH secretion observed in the genetically obese Zucker rat is due, at least partially, to insufficient stimulation by hypothalamic GRF, and that SRIF does not play a significant role.\r"

  ".W": "The neuropeptide galanin (GAL) is widely distributed throughout the diffuse neuroendocrine system, and is coexpressed with acetylcholine, norepinephrine, prolactin, and a variety of other messenger substances in different cell types. Bovine chromaffin cells in primary culture synthesize and store GAL along with catecholamines, chromogranin A, and enkephalin peptides, as well as other neurosecretory products, and secrete all these molecules in response to nicotinic stimulation. The regulation of GAL biosynthesis and secretion were studied by measuring changes in messenger RNA (mRNA(GAL], and peptide immunoreactivity, 24-72 h after stimulation of secretion (40 mM potassium or 10 microM veratridine), or exposure to stimulators of protein kinase C (100 nM phorbol myristate acetate) and protein kinase A (25 microM forskolin). Depolarization-induced stimulation of GAL biosynthesis, like that of enkephalin and other neuropeptides, was calcium dependent, suggesting that calcium generally mediates both exocytotic release and new peptide synthesis thus coordinating maintenance of neuropeptide levels in chromaffin cells. GAL and mRNA(GAL) were also upregulated by stimulation of protein kinase A with forskolin. Treatment with PMA increased GAL and mRNA(GAL) to an even greater extent than depolarization. Thus GAL expression can be regulated by three distinct signal transduction systems in chromaffin cells: depolarization-stimulated calcium influx, activation of protein kinase C and activation of protein kinase A, which in addition differentially up- and down-regulate the expression of several other neurosecretory proteins and peptides resulting in different patterns of GAL/neuropeptide coexistence in bovine chromaffin cells. GAL coexistence with diverse neuroendocrine substances may reflect the relative activity of these three signalling systems in other neuroendocrine cell types as well.\r"

  ".U": "91065285\r", 
  ".W": "Although serotonin (5HT) is a recognized stimulator of aldosterone secretion in vivo and in vitro, its physiological role as a regulator of mineralocorticoid secretion and its mechanism of action in the adrenal glomerulosa have not been elucidated. To address these questions we studied the interaction of 5HT with other aldosterone regulators in isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells. 5HT stimulated aldosterone production 14-fold, with an ED50 of 20 +/- 5 nM, and stimulation was maximal at 0.8 microM. The stimulation of aldosterone production by 5HT was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in cAMP production, with an ED50 of 1 microM. Threshold levels of 5HT (1 nM) potentiated the effect of submaximal concentrations of angiotensin-II (AII), decreasing the ED50 from 1.3 to 0.46 nM and increasing the maximum response in an additive manner. In contrast, the stimulatory effect of 5HT was purely additive to that of submaximal ACTH concentrations. 5HT had no effect on aldosterone secretion stimulated by maximal ACTH concentrations, despite full additivity on cAMP accumulation. Stimulations of steroidogenesis by potassium and 5HT were fully additive at submaximal concentrations, but only partially additive at-maximal levels. To determine the mechanism of the synergistic effects of AII and 5HT, we analyzed the interaction of both stimuli on cAMP accumulation, intracellular calcium, and inositol phosphate formation. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of AII on adenylate cyclase, in the presence of AII the stimulation of cAMP by 5HT was reduced by 18 +/- 3%. 5HT alone had no effect on cytosolic calcium, but significantly enhanced the peak and later phases of the AII-stimulated increase (P less than 0.005). This effect of 5HT was due to calcium influx and not to release from intracellular pools, as shown by suppression of the potentiation in the absence of extracellular calcium and the lack of effect of 5HT on basal or AII-stimulated inositol phosphate formation. The ability of low concentrations of 5HT to potentiate the stimulatory effect of AII on aldosterone secretion suggests that under some physiological conditions, 5HT may play a role in regulating the adrenal sensitivity to AII.\r"

Fetal rat calvaria cells were plated at 3 x 10(4) cells/35-mm dish, and cultures were maintained for 17-23 days in alpha-Minimal Essential Medium containing ascorbic acid, Na beta-glycerophosphate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Continuous exposure to PTH at concentrations from 1 pM to 1 nM (2 x 10(-5) to 2 x 10(-2) IU/ml) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of bone nodule formation. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at 0.05 nM, and total inhibition at 1 nM, concentrations much lower than those required to elicit a significant cAMP response in rat calvaria cells. PTH at the concentrations used did not affect cell growth or saturation density. While continuous exposure to 1 nM PTH eliminated bone nodule formation, a single 48-h pulse administered at any time during the 17-day culture period had no effect. When 1 nM PTH was added on day 1 and removed at different times during the culture period, a time-related release from inhibition was observed. Cultures exposed to 1 nM PTH until nodules had developed in the corresponding control cultures and then switched to medium without added PTH rapidly formed clusters of differentiated osteoblasts and nodules within 3 days. PTH added at different times during the culture period and present continuously there-after suppressed formation of new nodules, the magnitude of the effect being a function of the duration of exposure. The results show that PTH at physiological concentrations is a potent suppressor of osteoblast differentiation and that its effect occurs at a late stage in the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, probably preventing differentiation of preosteoblasts into osteoblasts.\r"

  ".W": "We have hypothesized that the change in placental cortisol (F)-cortisone (E) metabolism induced by estrogen late in gestation is important to activation of the baboon fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, culminating in the ontogenesis of de novo F secretion by the fetal adrenal. The present study tested this hypothesis in vivo by comparing the proportion of F in the fetus derived via maternal and fetal production on day 100 (n = 7; term = day 184) and day 165 (n = 4) in untreated baboons and on day 100 in baboons (n = 9) in which 50-mg pellets of androstenedione were implanted sc in the mother in increasing numbers (i.e. two on day 70, four on day 78, six on day 86, and eight on day 94) to increase placental estrogen production. Maternal, uterine, and umbilical venous samples were collected during constant maternal infusion (120 min) of [3H]F/[14C]E, endogenous and radiolabeled F/E content was determined, and corticosteroid dynamics were quantified. The MCR and peripheral interconversion of F and E as well as the production rate of F were unaltered in the mother. However, at midgestation, androstenedione increased (P less than 0.05) estrogen by 62% and altered transuterofeto placental F-E metabolism from preferential reduction of E (%F----E = 17 +/- 4; %E----F = 27 +/- 7) to preferential oxidation of F (%F----E = 26 +/- 2; %E----F = 5 +/- 2), a pattern similar to that at term (%F----E = 32 +/- 6; %E----F = 9 +/- 4). In untreated baboons, on day 100 none of the F in the fetus was due to fetal production, whereas by day 165, 49 +/- 6% was of fetal origin. In animals treated with androstenedione at midgestation, 22 +/- 4% of fetal F was derived de novo within the fetus. Thus, production of F by the fetus was negligible on day 100, increased near term in association with an increase in transplacental oxidation of F to E, and was induced at midgestation in baboons in which placental F-E metabolism was altered by an increase in estrogen production. These findings provide indirect evidence that supports our hypothesis that the change in placental F-E metabolism induced by increasing estrogen late in pregnancy results in activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and, thus, ontogenesis of fetal F production near term.\r"

Testicular ABP and plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which is produced in liver, are encoded by the same gene. We have now found that the ABP-SHBG gene is also expressed in male and female rat brain. Immunoreactive ABP was found to be present in neuronal cell bodies throughout the brain as well as in fibers of the hypothalamic median eminence. The highest concentrations of immunoreactive cell bodies were located in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Likewise, ABP mRNA was present in all brain regions examined. Analysis of cDNA clones representing brain ABP mRNAs revealed amino acid sequence differences in brain and testicular ABPs. The protein encoded by an alternatively processed RNA has sequence characteristics suggesting that the protein could act as a competitior of ABP binding to cell surface receptors. These data and gene-sequencing experiments indicate that a specific ABP gene promoter is used for transcription initiation in brain. ABP may function in brain as an androgen carrier protein; however, in view of the widespread presence of ABP and ABP mRNA in brain, the protein may have a much broader, yet unknown, function.\r"

The Rcho tumor was analyzed biochemically and histologically for the expression of placental PRLs. Expression of placental PRL mRNAs was determined by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. Expression of placental PRL proteins was determined by Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. Histologically, Rcho tumors were characterized by the appearance of giant cell surrounding hemorrhagic regions. Female rats bearing the Rcho tumor beneath their kidney capsule showed extensive mammary gland development. The Rcho tumors expressed placental lactogen-I (PL-I) mRNA and protein, but there was no evidence of placental lactogen-II (PL-II), PRL-like protein-A (PLP-A), or PRL-like protein-B (PLP-B). Rcho PL-I mRNA and proteins migrated as a 1-kilobase species and a 36- to 40-kDa species similar to those expressed by normal rat trophoblast tissues. The cell type responsible for Rcho PL-I production was the giant cell, similar to that observed in normal rat trophoblast tissues. In summary, we have demonstrated the production of PL-I by a transplantable rat choriocarcinoma (Rcho). The Rcho tumor resembles rat trophoblast tissue at early postimplantation stages (days 6-10 of gestation) and may be a useful tool for studying placental PRL expression during trophoblast differentiation.\r"

This translocation occurs 2-10 h after IL2 stimulation, and is reversed by the addition of anti-PRL antiserum into the extracellular culture medium. The nuclear localization of PRL in IL2 stimulated T-cells was confirmed by postembedding immunogold EM. The nuclear uptake of PRL after IL2 stimulation was further documented by EM studies using PRL-colloidal gold conjugates. These studies suggest that the intranuclear PRL is translocated from the extracellular medium via an endosomal/lysosomal pathway over a period of several hours. Finally, the requirement for PRL no later than 6 h after IL2 stimulation is demonstrated through the reversible inhibition of T-cell growth with anti-PRL antiserum.\r"

One group (A) of three Mabs is directed against hTg without discrimination between different iodine contents of Tg. The second group (B) of three Mabs has a higher affinity for iodinated Tg than for noniodinated Tg, and the Mabs are not species specific. The last group (C) of two Mabs generated against noniodinated hTg shows a higher affinity for noniodinated hTg than for iodinated hTg. From competition experiments with T4 we conclude that the second group of Mabs is directed against hormonogenic sites in the protein. From these Mabs, probably two are directed against the N-terminal hormonogenic site, and one against one of the C-terminal hormonogenic sites in Tg. Reactivity of the Mabs of group B with Tgs of various degrees of iodination indicates that the N-terminal T4 is formed first.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of a cyclopropenoid fatty acid (CPFA) on progesterone (P4) production by the ovine corpus luteum (CL) during the estrous cycle. Ewes in Exp 1 and 2 were laparotomized on day 2 of the estrous cycle, and animals with CL in both ovaries were subjected to unilateral ovariectomy. Ewes with CL in one ovary only were not ovariectomized. During surgery, ewes were injected with a mixture of fatty acids (sterculic acid, 39%; palmitic, 29%; linoleic, 12%; malvalic acid, 9%; oleic, 8%; stearic, 3%) containing 500 micrograms sterculic acid (SA; Exp 1), 750 micrograms SA, or 750 micrograms oleic acid (Exp 2) via the artery supplying the ovary bearing the CL. Control ewes were similarly injected with vehicle only (0.1-0.2 ml dimethylsulfoxide; Exp 1 and 2, respectively). Sera from blood samples collected at 15-min intervals for 1 h after injection or once daily on alternate days of the cycle after surgery were analyzed for LH and P4, respectively. In Exp 3, slices of CL removed from five ewes on day 10 of the cycle were incubated for 90 min in medium containing 100 ng/ml SA or vehicle (10 microliters dimethylsulfoxide). Slices were then reincubated for 90 min in medium containing 10 ng/ml oLH or saline (10 microliters). Tissue and medium were analyzed for P4. Injection of 500 micrograms SA suppressed serum levels of P4 (P less than 0.01), but did not alter mean cycle length. Injection of 750 micrograms SA reduced serum concentrations of P4 and shortened estrous cycle duration (P less than 0.005). Oleic acid (750 micrograms) or as much as 1.9 mg of a mixture of fatty acids devoid of CPFA had no effect on cycle length or serum levels of P4, suggesting that altered luteal function was due to the type and not the quantity of fatty acid injected. Treatments had no effect on serum concentrations of LH. Preincubation with SA interfered with the ability of luteal slices to synthesize P4 when subsequently incubated alone or with ovine LH (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that SA acts on the CL to impair steroidogenesis and ultimately cause luteal regression.\r"

AR was visualized using either of two polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides with sequences derived from rat and human AR. Tissue sections of 6-8 microns, frozen in isopentane and fixed in paraformaldehyde, were stained using immunoglobulin G fractions of immune, preimmune, and peptide-adsorbed immune sera in the avidin-biotin peroxidase procedure. AR was prominent in nuclei of acinar epithelial cells of epididymis, ventral prostate, seminal vesicle, and ductus deferens from the intact rat. Androgen withdrawal, 3 days after castration, resulted in the loss of receptor immunostaining, which was restored within 15 min of androgen administration. Stromal cell staining was absent or weak in the ventral prostate of intact rats, but was more evident in the epididymis. AR was confined to nuclei of cells within and bordering the interstitial compartment of the testis, including Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells, and interstitial cells, and was undetectable in germ cells. Submaxillary gland epithelial cells and a population of rat anterior pituitary cells showed strong nuclear staining of AR. In rat brain, AR was present in the medial preoptic, arcurate, and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, the medial nucleus of the amygdala, the CA-1 hippocampus, and the cortex. AR was prominent in acinar epithelial cells in human benign prostatic hyperplasia and was also present in stroma of fibromuscular benign hyperplasia. Heterogeneous staining was observed in stromal and epithelial cells of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The results of these studies indicate that AR can be detected immunohistochemically in a variety of tissues and cell types using antipeptide polyclonal antibodies. The presence of AR in tissues correlated with their known androgen responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Activin and inhibin are peptide hormones produced in the gonads which may act as autocrine and/or paracrine regulators of testicular function. Sertoli cells produce inhibin, and it has recently been shown that Leydig cells can produce activin in vitro. To further explore the local actions of activin and inhibin in the testis, Sertoli and germ cells were isolated from immature rats and cocultured in vitro. In these cultures we demonstrate that activin A and activin B, but not inhibin A, stimulated spermatogonial proliferation in vitro. Activin increased [3H]thymidine incorporation 2- to 4-fold in cocultures after 48-72 h of treatment. Using autoradiography, the label was localized in the clusters of spermatogonia adhering to the Sertoli cell monolayer. Additionally, activin stimulated a reaggregation of the cultures into tubule-like structures. Fluorescence-activated cytometry was used to analyze the cell population based on size, DNA content, and lipid content. Sertoli cells were identified using Nile Red staining of intracellular lipid droplets; spermatogonia are Nile Red-negative. Activin treatment caused a marked increase in the fraction of Nile Red-negative cells in the cocultures. Activin also caused an increase in the percentage of these cells having 4C DNA. Lastly, specific binding of activin A to 2C, but not 4C, germ cells was demonstrated. These data demonstrate that activin acts as a regulator of spermatogonial proliferation in the male.\r"

We tested early (bipotent) and late (unipotent) precursors of these MNC for expression of several osteoclast differentiation markers: 1) the osteoclast vitronectin receptor, identified by the 23c6 monoclonal antibody, 2) the vacuolar-type proton pump, identified by the E11 monoclonal antibody, and 3) the calcitonin (CT) receptor, by autoradiography with 125I-labeled salmon calcitonin. We wished to determine if the proton pump was expressed in cells in long term marrow cultures and if its expression correlated with expression of the CT receptor and the vitronectin receptor. About 30% of early precursor cells reacted with the 23c6 monoclonal antibody, but none expressed CT receptors or showed amplified proton pump expression. The CT receptor and amplified proton pump expression were detected first on the late precursor, a stage in which every cell reacted strongly with the 23c6 monoclonal antibody. Over 80% of MNC formed from these late precursors expressed abundant CT receptors, and all MNC expressed the vitronectin receptor and showed amplified proton pump expression. In contrast, macrophage polykaryons and mononuclear macrophages formed in vitro failed to express the osteoclast vitronectin and CT receptors and expressed the proton pump at levels indistinguishable from those of surrounding cells.\r"

  ".W": "The seminal vesicles (SV) develop from the lower portion of the Wolffian ducts (WD) in response to androgens, which prevent their degeneration and subsequently stimulate organogenesis of the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. Earlier studies suggest that testosterone (T) is the active androgen for WD development. By contrast, development of urogenital sinus and external genitalia is dependent upon 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), produced by 5 alpha-reductase within the target tissue itself. To reevaluate the possible role of DHT during SV morphogenesis, SVs from 0-day-old (day of birth) mice were grown for 3, 6, or 9 days in either serum-free or serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of T (10(-7) M) or DHT (10(-8) M). The serum-free medium consisted of Ham's F-12-Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (1:1) containing insulin, transferrin, cholera toxin, BSA, and epidermal growth factor. The serum-containing medium was Ham's F-12-Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Epithelial branching morphogenesis of SVs occurred in serum-free or serum-containing medium supplemented with either T or DHT and was comparable to that of SVs of similar ages in vivo. In serum-containing medium the DNA content of the cultures was about 2-fold higher in T-containing vs. T-deficient medium. However, in serum-free medium the DNA content was the same in cultures grown with or without T. SVs cultured under serum-free conditions in the presence of T plus 390 MSD (17 beta-N,N-diisopropylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one, an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase) were completely inhibited in their development, while in the presence of DHT plus 390 MSD, branching morphogenesis was comparable to that in SVs cultured in the presence of T or DHT alone. In medium lacking either T or DHT, SV development was inhibited. In addition, it was confirmed by TLC that [1 beta,2 beta-3H]T was converted into [3H]DHT at the ratio of 15.4% for the first 2 days and at 35.3% for the subsequent 2 days of the culture of SVs in serum-free medium. These data demonstrate that T is important as a precursor of DHT and DHT is the major androgen in the postnatal development of mouse SVs from the lower WD.\r"

We report the molecular cloning of a third type of cDNA clone encoding rat 3 beta- HSD isolated from a rat liver lambda gt11 cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of 1955 bp determined from overlapping cDNA clones predicts a protein of 372 amino acids which displays 80% similarity with that of rat type I and type II 3 beta-HSD proteins. RNA blot analysis reveals the presence of mRNA transcripts of 2.1 kb in male liver in contrast to the 1.7 kb mRNA species detected in adrenal and gonad poly(A)+ RNA. Ribonuclease protection assays using type I, type II and type III specific cRNA probes demonstrate the liver-specific expression of type III mRNA while the two others are expressed in adrenals and gonads. The type III mRNA species was below the detection limit in intact female liver while in hypophysectomized females, its accumulation was restored to 55% of the levels measured in intact or hypophysectomized male rats. The present data describe the presence of a third type of 3 beta-HSD mRNA species and its marked sexual dimorphic gene expression in the liver which apparently results from pituitary hormone-induced gene repression in female rat liver tissue.\r"

In the present study, ECBP have been crosslinked to IGF-I and the biologically inactive [1-27,gly4,38-70]-hlGF-I, an analog of IGF-I lacking the type I IGF receptor domain. The crosslinked ECBPs were perfused through the isolated rat heart and their tissue distributions determined. Both [ECBP-Analog] and [ECBP-IGF-I] left the microcirculation of the heart. [ECBP-Analog] preferentially localized in connective tissue elements with a muscle:connective tissue ratio of approximately 1:6, similar to the tissue distribution of perfused ECBP. In contrast, the [ECBP-IGF-I] complexes localized in cardiac muscle with a muscle to connective tissue ratio of approximately 3:1, virtually identical to the tissue distribution of IGF-I when the IGF-I is perfused through the heart in the absence of any binding proteins. We conclude that 1) ECBP in the presence of IGF will cross capillary boundaries and 2) the tissue distribution of [ECBP-IGF-I] is dictated by the IGF-I molecule.\r"

  ".U": "91065306\r", 
  ".W": "While the potential role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I in ovarian physiology has been extensively studied, relatively limited attention has been paid to IGF-II the very presence of which in the mature rat ovary has been questioned. In the present study, we have reevaluated rat ovarian IGF-II gene expression, its cellular localization, hormonal regulation, and site(s) of receptor interaction. IGF-II mRNA was detected in whole ovaries from immature as well as mature intact rats. Cellular localization studies revealed IGF-II transcripts in theca-interstitial but not granulosa cells (a site of IGF-I gene expression). In contrast, no cellular selectivity was noted for Type I and Type II IGF receptor gene expression, both of which were clearly detectable in both granulosa and theca-interstitial cells. In vivo treatment of immature hypophysectomized rats with diethylstilbestrol reduced ovarian IGF-II mRNA levels while increasing IGF-I mRNA levels. Taken together, these and previous observations reveal fundamental differences in the cellular localization and hormonal regulation of ovarian IGF gene expression in that IGF-II gene expression (unlike IGF-I) is theca-interstitial (rather than granulosa) cell-specific, and is subject to down (as opposed to up) regulation in response to estrogenic stimulation. In contrast, Type I and Type II IGF receptors exist on both somatic cell types of the rat ovary. These observations are consistent with the view that IGF-II of theca-interstitial cell origin may not only play an autocrine role but may also serve as one of several signals through which this androgen-producing cell may communicate in a paracrine fashion with the adjacent granulosa cell compartment.\r"

Moreover, epithelial cell-derived C3 co-migrates in SDS-PAGE with that produced by HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line previously used to elucidate complement component biosynthesis. Pulse-chase studies in A-431 cells demonstrate that epithelial cell-derived C3 is produced as a 195-kD precursor molecule, pro-C3, which is processed intracellularly by limited proteolysis into 120- and 75-kD C3 alpha and beta chains. Comparative studies demonstrate that A-431 cell-derived C3 is synthesized, processed, and secreted in parallel but in lower quantity than that produced by HepG2 cells. Treatment of biosynthetically labeled A-431 cell culture supernatants with normal human serum and zymosan produces C3 alpha chain cleavage and specific C3 fragments that are not present in control culture supernatants treated with heat-inactivated human serum and zymosan. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA extracted from A-431 cells, human keratinocytes, and HepG2 cells reveals quantitative identity of a 5.1-kb C3 mRNA species in these three cell types. Epithelial cell-derived C3 may play an important role in local inflammatory and immunologic reactions including such reactions in human skin. Moreover, epithelial cell C3 synthesis may have direct relevance to the recent demonstration of C3d,g within selected normal primate epithelial basement membranes, including epidermal basement membrane.\r"

Histologic analysis of biopsies of these partial-thickness wounds taken during bFGF-mediated healing supported the assessment of an enhanced rate of epithelialization and an earlier onset of dermal healing. Because no histologic abnormalities were observed, bFGF induced an acceleration of what appears to be the normal healing process.\r"

Cell viability, measured 24-48 h after a 20-min heat challenge at temperatures between 37 degrees C and 54 degrees C, declined sharply within a narrow 2 degrees-3 degrees C range. However, conditioning with a mild thermal pretreatment (40 degrees C or 42 degrees C for 1 h) protected the keratinocytes against a subsequent heat challenge. This induced thermotolerance was apparent when cells were challenged at 1, 3, and 6 h after the thermal pre-treatment, but disappeared by 24 h. Heating conditions that induce thermotolerance also stimulated the synthesis of heat-shock proteins (hsp) in these cells. Inductions of prominent 35S-methionine labeled bands at 70, 78, and 90 kDa were observed. However, the increases in synthesis of these heat-shock proteins did not correlate well with thermotolerance, because large increases were also observed at certain elevated temperatures that did not produce improved survival. Keratins observed in these cells (50 and 58 kDa classes) were not induced by heat shock. The development of thermotolerance, and the induction of hsp, were both completely blocked by 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), an inhibitor of newly synthesized messenger RNA, but not by adenosine, the normal analog. While heat-inducible mRNA apparently mediate some function important for the development of thermotolerance, the nature of that role remains speculative. Overall, our findings establish the existence of a functional thermal protective mechanism in human keratinocytes that appears to require the synthesis of new mRNA.\r"

In this study, IgG subclasses of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) and neonatal lupus (NLE) are examined in the serum and in the skin. IgG subclasses in NLE beginning in utero (NLE-heart disease) are compared to subclasses in NLE beginning after birth (NLE-skin disease). Human skin was grafted onto athymic mice, mice were injected with one of eight anti-Ro/SSA maternal NLE sera (four heart block, four skin disease) or seven anti-Ro/SSA SCLE sera, and grafts were examined for IgG subclasses using monoclonal anti-human IgG subclass reagents in an immunofluorescent technique. Lesional skin was examined from four SCLE patients. IgG1 was the only IgG subclass detected in the grafts and skin lesions. IgG1 was the predominant anti-Ro/SSA IgG subclass detected in SCLE and NLE sera in an ELISA using a synthetic Ro/SSA polypeptide. These studies show that the maternal anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in NLE-heart disease sera are predominantly IgG1 and are therefore likely to be present in the fetus at the time of gestation, when heart block usually develops. Second, differences in the clinical presentations of NLE (in utero vs. postnatal disease) cannot be attributed to differences in anti-Ro/SSA IgG subclasses. Finally, the subclass bound in the skin in SCLE is IgG1, a subclass capable of mediating tissue injury via complement or cellular effectors.\r"

Western blots and solid phase RIA showed both antibodies bound to 65-67-kD basic keratins (K1 and K2) extracted from foreskin epidermis. Competitive binding studies with the two Kab antibodies and other anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies showed that Kab-2 and Kab-3 recognized related epitopes, distinct from the epitopes recognized by other anti-keratin antibodies AE-1, 2, and 3. Kab-2 and Kab-3 epitopes were distinguished by differences in their reactivity with peptides generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of the K1 keratin; the antibodies recognized both common and unique peptides. Western blots of cyanogen bromide digests of the K1 keratin showed that both Kab antibodies reacted with a 30-kD fragment of the molecule presumed to be the N-terminal CNBr peptide. We interpret these data to indicate that in tissues, portions of the N-terminal region of the K1 keratin are differentially available for reaction with these monoclonal antibodies and that morphologic differences in staining with monoclonal antibodies to the same molecule can reflect epitope specificity or epitope availability related to supramolecular organization.\r"

Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect.\r"

Multiple lymph flow determinations were undertaken in the skin of anaesthetized large white pigs to test for reproducibility, ascertain the most suitable tracer, study the influence of injection dynamics, and observe the effect of massage as a stimulus to lymph flow. Blood clearance of tracer was also investigated. Results demonstrated that lymphatic clearance is a monoexponential function with good reproducibility under controlled laboratory conditions. 99mTc-colloid (TCK17 Cis) compared favorably with 131I-human serum albumin as a tracer and both performed better than colloid gold (198Au). Lymph flow was significantly faster in one pig than in the other. No difference existed between left and right sides or between caudal and rostral sites on each flank, but clearance was significantly slower in thigh than flank skin. Sub-epidermal injections cleared faster and more consistently than either deep or subcutaneous injections. Neither injection volume nor needle tract backflow of tracer influenced results, but local massage significantly enhanced clearance. Escape of 99mTc-colloid by the blood was negligible. These results indicate that skin lymph flow can be reliably measured when conditions are controlled. Extrinsic factors such as massage strongly influence lymph flow. Greater sensitivity in detecting degrees of lymphatic insufficiency may be achieved if a standardized stimulus to lymph flow is administered during isotope clearance measurement.\r"

Using a random, double-blind protocol, the women were given either a 2% minoxidil solution or a placebo of vehicle only. Hair in a permanently marked site on the fronto-parietal scalp was pulled through a 1-cm-square clear plastic template, and the outline of the template was drawn on the scalp. The hair was carefully hand clipped and collected at five eight-week intervals (one untreated and four treated), using great care to collect only hairs within the marked area. Subsequent measurements included the total weight of hair grown in the marked area, the total number of hairs, and, on a randomized 50-hair subsample, the weight, lengths, and optical diameters. Calculated quantities included average weight per hair, average length, and average optical width. The average total hair weight of minoxidil-treated subjects increased over the 32-week test period by 42.5%, compared to 1.9% for the placebo-treated subjects (average p = 0.018). Changes for the average number count were 29.9% and -2.6%, respectively (average p = 0.022). These increases, observed using an unusually small number of subjects, clearly distinguished the treated subjects from the untreated. During the same test period, the averaged quantities of weight, diameter, and length from the 50-hair subsample showed insignificant change (p usually greater than 0.5). In addition to showing a larger percentage increase than did the total number, the total weight is not only easier to obtain, but less prone to error during sampling and measurement. Therefore, we recommend that total weight from a defined area be considered as the primary quantitative estimator for hair growth.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1, a multifunctional cytokine, plays a central role in inflammatory processes. Several reports have appeared demonstrating that IL-1 stimulates growth of keratinocytes under certain experimental conditions, and we have shown previously that it can act as a strong stimulator of DNA synthesis in murine keratinocytes that have been growth-arrested by removal of growth factors (GF) from the medium for several days. Using the same assay system, we report here that, in contrast to cultured mouse keratinocytes, growth-arrested adult and newborn human keratinocytes do not respond to IL-1 with an increase in DNA synthesis. The experiments were performed with primary and secondary cells and cells propagated with and without feeder layer prior to the assay. A growth response to IL-1 in the absence of exogenous GF was only observed in non-growth-arrested human keratinocytes, i.e., when the cytokine was added for 24 to 48 h immediately after removal of other GF from the culture. Because keratinocytes continue to grow during this time anyway, although at a reduced rate, the additional growth observed with IL-1 could be explained as an enhancement of the growth-promoting effect by factors not previously completely removed from the culture. We would like to conclude from our results that, contrary to the findings in cultured mouse keratinocytes, IL-1 has no direct mitogenic effect on cultured human keratinocytes, but can still act as a growth promoter under certain conditions, apparently in concert with other GF.\r"

This sophisticated culture system is composed, as in vivo, of a dermis and epidermis, and provides a unique in vitro system for studying dermal-epidermal interactions and thus, whether normal dermal fibroblasts influence the effects of retinoids on epidermal growth. Epidermalization was initiated on collagen substrates in which fibroblasts were either viable or lysed by osmotic shock. Retinoic acid, isotretinoin, and acitretin at 10(-6) M or 10(-7) M were added to the cultures just after epidermalization, then every two days. Epidermal growth was determined after 2 weeks in terms of the surface area, DNA content, and tritiated thymidine incorporation during the last 24 h of culture. In the absence of viable fibroblasts, retinoic acid and isotretinoin increased epidermal growth, whereas etretin inhibited it. In contrast, in the presence of viable fibroblasts, retinoic acid and isotretinoin inhibited epidermal growth, whereas etretin had no effect. Thus, retinoic acid and isotretinoin had a similar effect on keratinocyte proliferation that contrasted with that of etretin. Taken as a whole, these results show that fibroblasts, present within a collagen substrate, can modulate the pharmacologic effects of retinoids on epidermal growth.\r"

Keratinocytes specifically bound [3H]bradykinin with high affinity (kd = 3.4 nM) and displayed 1.5 X 10(5) binding sites/cell. Bradykinin caused a rapid dose-dependent increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate. IP3 was maximally increased (fivefold) at 30 s and remained elevated for at least 10 min. Half maximal stimulation of IP3 formation was observed at 27 nM bradykinin. IP3 accumulation was equally elevated by bradykinin and lys-bradykinin but was not stimulated by des-Arg9-bradykinin, indicating that phospholipase C in cultured keratinocytes is coupled to B2 bradykinin receptors. Treatment of keratinocytes with active phorbol ester (TPA) caused a significant inhibition (50%) of bradykinin-induced IP3 accumulation, suggesting negative regulation of phospholipase C by protein kinase C. Bradykinin also caused a significant elevation in 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) content. DAG content was maximally elevated (twofold) at 1 min and remained elevated for at least 10 min. Bradykinin also caused a significant (twofold, p less than 0.02) increase in keratinocyte growth. These data demonstrate that bradykinin is a potent agonist of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signal transduction system in cultured adult human keratinocytes and that activation of this pathway by bradykinin is associated with increased keratinocyte growth.\r"

After visually assessing and grading the resulting inflammatory reactions, punch biopsies were taken and the morphology and density of CD1+ cells in the epidermis studied using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with image analysis and electron microscopy. Statistically significant decreases in the epidermal density of CD1+ cells occurred in the responses to dithranol (p less than 0.05) and nonanoic acid (p less than 0.01). Importantly, these changes in density were not simply due to variations in the intensity of inflammatory response (r = 0.1157). Alterations in the length of the dendritic processes of CD1+ cells were also induced, and semi-quantitative analysis revealed significant decreases in dendrite length in the reactions to sodium lauryl sulphate (p less than 0.05), nonanoic acid (p less than 0.001), croton oil (p less than 0.05), and dithranol (p less than 0.005). Unlike epidermal density, however, this effect on cell morphology was directly related to the severity of inflammation (r = -0.74, p less than 0.01). Morphologic evidence of cellular injury to Langerhans cells was seen by electron microscopy in the majority of biopsies, although relatively few cells were affected in sodium lauryl sulphate and propylene glycol reactions. Benzalkonium chloride, unlike the other irritants, also induced a state of metabolic activation in a high proportion of epidermal Langerhans cells. Lymphocyte/Langerhans cell apposition was observed in most samples, but was particularly prevalent in the reactions to dithranol. The results of this study demonstrate that significant changes in the morphology and density of Langerhans cells occur in irritant contact dermatitis, some of which are directly influenced by the chemical nature of the irritant.\r"

  ".W": "Peak (1 and 2 d) and healing (3, 6, and 10 d) inflammatory lesions were produced in rabbits by the topical application of the military vesicant, bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide, commonly called sulfur mustard (SM). SM produces an acute sterile dermal inflammatory reaction with little or no necrosis, except in the epidermis, which dies during the first day. After an animal was killed, its lesions were excised intact, as full-thickness 1.0-cm2 explants. They were then organ-cultured for 3 d in order to maintain the viability of both local and infiltrating cells. The extracellular fluid in each lesion equilibrated with the culture fluid, which was collected daily and analyzed for collagenase and proteoglycanase activities. These metalloproteinase activities were measured after we had i) destroyed the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors with KSCN, ii) destroyed the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) by reduction and alkylation, and iii) activated the latent proteinase activity with aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). Hydroxyproline-containing peptides and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) released into the culture fluids were also measured as indicators of local collagenase and proteoglycanase activity within the inflammatory lesions. In general, the levels of both the metalloproteinases and the products of their activity were higher in second- and third-day culture fluids than in first-day culture fluids, and higher in fluids from SM lesions than in those from normal skin. The activated fibroblast was apparently the major cell type producing the collagenase and proteoglycanase. The hydrolysis of collagen and ground substance occurs pericellularly. An excess of inhibitors exists outside the pericellular region. The daily change in culture fluids apparently decreased such inhibitors, so that by the second and third day of culture we could detect the changes in pericellular enzyme activity that were not detectable on the first day of culture. As the inflammatory lesions healed, the extracellular enzyme products (hydroxyproline and GAG) increased more than the enzymes that produced these products. With healing, a decrease occurs in the extravasation of all serum components, especially the large ones such as the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors. We propose that during healing, the decrease in these inhibitors allows the metalloproteinases to begin the remodeling process, and that during the peak phase of inflammation, these same inhibitors protect extracellular matrix against hydrolysis by such proteinases.\r"

We have used DNA irradiation and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to analyze MYCN amplification structures in eight neuroblastomas from separate patients (four primary tumors and four metastatic lesions exhibiting MYCN amplification). Six of the eight neuroblastomas (three primary tumors and three metastatic lesions) exhibited MYCN DNA irradiation profiles consistent with the presence of circular extrachromosomal DNA amplification structures. Five neuroblastomas possessed amplification structures within the size range of double minute chromosomes, and one contained smaller DNA circles. Two neuroblastomas exhibited MYCN DNA irradiation patterns consistent with larger (presumably chromosomal) amplification structures. Multiple sizes of DNA circles were observed in the neuroblastomas of four different patients, implying in vivo multimerization of amplification structures. The presence of circular MYCN amplification structures in six of eight neuroblastomas examined suggests that circular DNA molecules are important structures in in vivo gene amplification.\r"

Six MAbs raised in this way were found to recognize at least five different cell-surface epitopes. Functional analysis of the different MAbs suggested their potential usefulness in passive immunization against parental tumorigenic cells as well as in enrichment of immunogenic cells from a mixed population containing a preponderance of tumorigenic cells.\r"

ABP is a potent bladder carcinogen that is N-acetylated as an overall detoxification step. Levels of the ABP hemoglobin adduct were higher in smokers of black tobacco (air-cured) than in smokers of blond tobacco (flue-cured), confirming our earlier study. In addition, \"slow\" acetylators had higher levels of the ABP hemoglobin adduct for the same type and quantity of cigarettes smoked. Urinary mutagenicity was also associated with quantity of cigarettes but not with the acetylation phenotype. Convex dose-response relationships were found between the amount smoked and ABP hemoglobin adduct levels or urinary mutagenicity. In 15 nonsmokers who reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, ABP hemoglobin adduct levels, unlike urinary mutagenicity, were found to be an aspecific exposure indicator.\r"

Risks increased in a dose-response fashion with increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked daily for both leukemia (trend P = .009) and myeloma (trend P = .005). Also, the risks of both leukemia and myeloma increased with the total duration of cigarette smoking. The cigarette smoking-leukemia relationship was strongest for myeloid leukemia, for which ex-smokers experienced a relative risk of 2.24 (95% confidence interval = 0.91-5.53). These data lend support to the hypothesis that cigarette smoke may induce malignant degeneration in bone marrow and its products.\r"

Motility in glucose-free medium was 75% reduced and utilized mitochondrial respiration (inhibited by oligomycin). With increasing (physiologic) glucose concentrations, there was a dramatic shift to anaerobic glycolysis as the energy source and 93% elimination of the oligomycin inhibition of motility. Oxamate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, inhibited motility at all glucose concentrations. CO2 production from glycolysis and from the hexose monophosphate shunt was measured in migrating tumor cells. The time course and glucose-dose dependence of glycolytic CO2 production correlated directly with motility. In contrast, mitochondrial CO2 production was inversely related to glucose concentration. A monoclonal antibody for the IGF-I receptor inhibited both motility and glycolytic CO2 production, indicating that both processes are receptor mediated.\r"

Two approaches are generally adopted when an attempt is made to maximize the efficiency of these drugs: concurrent use (where synergism is expected) or sequential administrations (exploiting the antiproliferative effects of etoposide). To differentiate between these approaches in a quantitative manner, we exposed an in vitro tumor model (V79 multicell spheroids) to the drugs, using treatment regimens with a constant weekly dose intensity. Some treatment schedules suggested the development of drug resistance, but this resulted from a changing growth fraction in the spheroids rather than from selection for or induction of cellular resistance. Fewer administrations of larger doses were generally less satisfactory than multiple, smaller treatments. The most effective sequence was an alternating regimen, by which the cytoreductive effects of cisplatin resulted in recruitment of quiescent cells into active proliferation, enhancing in turn the efficiency of subsequent etoposide treatment.\r"
